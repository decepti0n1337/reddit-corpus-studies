You are surprised that people aren't jumping at the opportunity to rehash the SAME points that have been made countless times before?
---

---
And in debates where the author put considerably more effort than you. Although that isn't difficult.
---
Weird how people aren't lining up to educate a person who spent 5 seconds and couldn't be bothered "thinking it through", yet somehow thinks his idea is not only unique, it's also the best.
---
---
---
I'm not the one trying to prove my "interesting thought".
---
DON'T TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE, MOM!
---
Oh absolutely! I'm not expecting to have the server to myself, it's still gonna be ridiculous at the start, maybe even for a few weeks. But surely competing with 3000 players is better than 10000 no?
---
AFAIK, the fastest vanilla 1-60 using official exp values and mob spawn times was 4 days 20 hours, and that was done by a hunter.
---
This is a detailed post, nice job. Also cast battle shout is good advice for getting threat.
---
Yeah then Blizzard banned him for exploiting. Fucking stupid how they punish players like that.
---
If the whole city is built on a slope, like we see here and not in a valley between some ridges. Then how do you get the Canals of Stormwind?
---
It’s also not true either. I have yet to play on a 10k pop pserver without lag. It’s actually why I don’t play on them when they are that populated. It’s why I chose Nost PvE over the PvP server cause I had pretty bad lag constantly on the PvP one.
---
I ran with a CC team and we rallied that place.  Sheeps saps entangling roots we had it all.
---
No I haven't, but tbh I think it would be worse since the reason hunters fall off is because pet damage doesn't scale. I've mostly just used the MM raiding spec and MM/Surv PvP spec. BM might be good early on in an expansion but would definitely fall off due to scaling
---
Jesus man, it’s not that big of a deal. Especially because it’s gonna be temporary. It’ll be in place so you don’t spend four weeks in northshire cause you just can’t get that kobald kill you need cause a thousand other players are doing it too at the same time.
---
It makes sense as to why they want it to be there in the first place. The backlash is over exaggerated and made even worse because of streamers. If anything you people should be angry at streamers because they’re going to heavily effect the game.
---
honestly the biggest effect is smaller populations are going to have a wider monopoly on the world. Most people are going to be poor af
---
I’m done talking to someone as dumb as you man I’m sorry I can’t anymore.  I don’t need to waste my time when I’ve already been proven correct on my statements at the very top of this thread.  
---
Have fun living life being wrong
---
It's actually the thing about Classic I love and hate at the same time. Do PvE in order to get gear for PvP, do PvP in order to get gear for PvE.
---
Honestly this is the kind of post I want to see and talk about. Well I won't be able to take PTO for the launch but IF I DID this is what I would do:
---
\- Wake up at whatever time allows me to have a full 8 hours of sleep (for me this is usually 8am). Gotta be fresh to think straight AND be able to remember this magical journey back through Azeroth
---
\- Big ass breakfast every morning that way I can sit and play for as long as I can without another meal. Eggs and pre-made pancakes are key that way there is little clean up and it's less down time trying to make the meal
---
\- Snacks: "poppable" snacks with minimal grease to get on your keyboard (gross). I think your idea of beef jerky is spot on. Personally I would just have a case of the pre-made protein shakes and just slam those that way there is ZERO grease that gets on your M+K.
---
\- At around noon I'd go for a nice lift and light cardio to get the blood flowing, freshen the mind, and make sure I don't get burned out on the game (I just need an hour or so and then I crave it again). Come back, slam a man-sandwich (ham, turkey, roast beef combo with 3 pieces of bread, mayo, sriracha, and cheese), then get back to the game. 
---
\- Take a quick shower around 6-8pm (no masturbating, that wastes time) so I feel fresh for the night time dungeon runs or questing
---
\- Unless I'm in an instance or an amazing group I'll hit the sack at or around midnight and repeat (guest bed is quite literally in the same room as my computer)

Multidot is exactly what they *can* do in raids. Usually the main target will be heavily contested with debuffs, but all the adds are free game. Most bosses and certainly most trash has more than one target. Lucifron and Gehennas has two adds as does Golemagg. Harbinger has  four adds and Majordomo has 8. 
---
BWL is the only raid without add heavy bosses, the only adds you'll find there are on the first boss and dots are not ideal there anyways. Some guilds actually do two of the loot drakes at the same time, so then you probably can multidot a bit.
---
Skeram has two images, Sartura has his guards, bug trio are focused one at a time so with clever positioning you can keep dots rolling on all of them. Fankriss and Visc have no dotable adds and Huhuran has no adds at all. Twin Emps you can dot the bugs but in general that fight is more a tank fight for warlocks. Ouro has no dotable adds. CT has many adds but few are reliably dotable.
---
Anub has his guardians, Faerlina has a bunch of adds, Maexxna has nothing unless you dot the cocoons, don't dot the cocoons.    Razuvius has four adds but don't do damage to them, Gothik has a wealth of adds but until you get the killing pace down I wouldn't bother with them. 4H you can usually unload your dots on whatever horseman you are fighting.    
---
Noth continually spawns adds and you can multidot these very well, until your raid dps is so strong that you just nuke them down immediately. Heigan has adds which you can cheese while running through the gauntlet. Loatheb has no dotable adds.    
---
Patch is a straight up nuke fight. Grobbolous has adds but I can't remember if we dot them or not, same with Gluth. Thaddius has no adds but you can probably dot the dogs quite heavily.
---
Sapphiron is a nuke fight and KT has a lot of adds but it's not always effective to dot and in the case of the guardians they need to be kited so be careful.
---
Ya even if something has absolutely minimal grease I HATE the way my keyboard feels and looks if it's not perfectly clean. Probably the OCD kicking in but whatever.
---
How's your wife taking this Classic launch by the way? I don't think mine is going to take it too well if we're being honest.
---
Mate don’t stress. Just level at your own pace and gear up with BiS pre MC, get attuned asap, Max your profs. You’ll find a guild that fits those requirements easily. 
---
What are you rolling? If it’s a healer or tank you’re laughing
---
Irrelevant statement. Never touched EQ, likely never will.
---
Yes I am because the 3 min CD was introduced in TBC, idiot. 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Fear_Ward
---
&gt;Patch 2.3.0 (13-Nov-2007): Fear Ward is now available to all priests at level 20. Duration reduced to 3 minutes, cooldown increased to 3 minutes. (Old - only draenei and dwarves, duration of 10 minutes, cooldown of 30 seconds)
---
For PvE your rotation is shadowbolt until oom, wand. its not difficult
---
This is what cancer looks like
---
Practice your username.
---
It's been discussed.
---
Think about that for a second. Buying BFA, to grind WoW tokens to ... Save money on a sub. That kinda sounds ridiculous doesn't it?
---
Well it's a good thing I didn't specifically reply to someone who had played EQ, and instead replied directly to you, isn't it?
---
I eventually quit playing because my realm was changed from PvP to PvE and the really core group of friends that I loved to play with all transferred to different servers. I really couldn't justify transferring all of my level 70's to another server cost wise and never really found another group to play with as close as I did them so I stopped partially into WotLK
---
Illidan - 69 is much better home.
---
I don't mean for them to open a bunch of servers this way, only however many they can justify profitability wise, and perhaps with a slightly higher than normal level cap that shrinks down to normal after phase one.
---
I just personally anticipate that Classic will be much more popular than they (and you) think. Especially if handled correctly. And there's no doubt in my mind that the present implementation of layering is the wrong answer.
---
Throw in an eighth of K and I’ll join you
---
1. SM/Ruin work fine in both.
---
2. In PvE you start out by applying your curse. Then you cast shadow bolt... That's about it..  Lifetap for mana.. Oh and shadowburn at the end, or waste a ton of soulshards by using it as a dps increase. SOMETIMES as SM/ruin you will be allowed to cast corruption. In PVP you don't really have rotations, it's far too complicated
---
3. In PvE no. In PvP It is one of the high skillcap classes, but it's not like the class is hard to play either. It's pretty simple.
---
except journey played with invalid xp values AND had 10\~ hours of rested xp and was done in 2 sittings.
---
At the risk of pissing people off..
---
I think those who ***obsess*** over celebrity streamers are just a modern parallel to those who obsess over reality TV and pop celebrities. A lack of agency in their own life that compels them to live vicariously through those who's lives are broadcasted 24/7. And often an insecurity which finds a sense of belonging and identity in these fan communities that are tailored to make members feel like the streamer/celebrity is their friend (*Insert-Streamer-Name-Here Army*).
---
Obviously this doesn't apply to those who consume this sort of media at a casual level, a lot of streamers genuinely **are** interesting and educational. But constantly following them around in-game *begging* to be noticed is straying pretty far off the path of "casual consumption". 
---
Look at this picture and tell me that's not the neckbeardy equivalent of Justin Bieber fangirls (or whoever the current equivalent marketed to impressionable young girls is).
---
Be able to handle all graphics settings turned up to 11 ya think?
---
I plan on hitting somewhere around 20 and that's a good 15-20 hours. 40 in one sitting is inhuman haha
---
Is this the 1.12 client? Probably sorren's hunter timers if that's the case.
---
You absolutely need exalted for the pvp mounts. I got exalted with dark spear on my orc back in the day to ride a pvp raptor
---
These times are so optimistic.
---
Haaa hahhaah... oh :(
---
I do yes, it has 1050 gpu in it which is 10x better (no memes if you dont get dedicated gpu your laptop will be terrible) than 940mx from most laptops from the older generation
---
I enjoyed BFA too until I realised I don't and nothing will help it. Took a wee while there, about 3 weeks after release. It's not bad for a thrash but then reality sets in.
---
Correct, so /I/akanoss’s claim is just wrong.
---
The only information we know is that a playerbase 270% the size of Oceania’s playerbase (Germany) that’s had their own servers since launch and for almost a decade longer than Oceania, isn’t getting their own Classic servers.
---
This decision was obviously made because Blizzard plans to condense regional playerbases into a handful of servers and use Layering until the population becomes stable or open up new servers if their estimates are way off.
---
So it’s a pretty good assumption that Oceania won’t be getting their own servers either. Just like the South Americans, they’ll be playing on servers hosted in Los Angeles. Likely 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP shared between them both and the US Pacific playerbase.
---
Oceania never had locally hosted servers until Warlords of Draenor anyway, so it’s not a big loss.
---
It's so painfully overdue. This sub has turned into absolute dogshit. There just aren't discussions here anymore, period. It's all trash-tier memes and useless old screenshots. Discussions have fully died out in /r/classicwow.
---
Hey there. Based on your post I think we might be a good fit for each other. I could give you the typical info dump or we can just chat. You can reach me at wildgunmen#1302 on bnet or WildGunmen#9537 on discord. 
---
Whatever you do, good luck in Classic!
---
get an i7 with a 2070 or an i5 with a 2060.... whichever fits your price point better.
---
Switching layers is *way* more convoluted than you're making it seem. Is there a way to even tell which layer youre on or do you just keep grouping until you do? Nodes have relatively long respawns, and the jumpers aren't the only ones gathering them. Runescape is a layered game, and you still had to jump to a bunch of worlds to reasonably increase gathering rates.
---
This in a laptop ?
---
You must not be watching the classic beta on twitch. People were grinding SM for super fast levels
---
400.. stacks? So like 8000 runecloth in total?
---
You do know that I'm advocating that most remain layered servers and only a small number go this route, right? I'd just much rather wait in a long queue (like, very long if necessary) everyday than have other players exploit layering for huge profits and drastically change the game's early economy. I'm probably rare in that respect, but I don't think I'm so rare that this isn't worth doing. (I assume this would take almost no effort on their part) In my case it's the difference between Blizzard getting a few hundred of my dollars, and if they start all new servers with layers, zero of my dollars.
---
The answer is always Shadowbolt.
---
Have they fixed melee leeway yet?
---
mind_expand.jpg
---
yes, they make laptops with these... why?
---
No, there really won’t be. Germany is 20% of EU’s playerbase and they’re not getting a server, which suggests all of EU isn’t getting more than 5, if that.
---
EU and NA+Oceania have almost identical playerbases, so it’s safe to assume that group won’t be getting more than EU. I gave each coast 3 servers just for simplicity.
---
It’s really unlikely that the smallest WoW playerbase is going to get their own servers when some of the biggest already aren’t.
---
I quit/restart periodically. My regular wow process for the last decade. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 New Expansion:  I sub, level up, enjoy the playthrough for the story(though I dont like the overall story of Wow anymore the quest storylines are generally fun to play and read)
---
Convince myself I am going to raid regularly.
---
Max - remember I find raiding to be really boring and tedious so I usually do raids once or twice
---
I quit
---
if one of the patches seem especially interesting I resub for a month and inevitably unsub once I get to the raiding.
---
Honestly I expect Classic to go the same way.  I did not even raid in the original wow and I want to see the content first hand so I will likely invest more time and play more than I do with new expansions but I sort of think once I see the content I likely will unsub.
---
Raids are hard :D About that...
---
Wow okay. No downsides to your idea. Pretty impressive. 
---
Why do you think blizzard have not already done what you are suggesting considering it's a great idea?
---
I don't think this guy wanna spend fortune on a high end laptop.
---
That made me laugh. Thank you
---
Yes it will be hard to level and play a warrior tank.. But do you want an easy class??  Go for the one you feel most affection for :)
---
No we're not.
---
Sure, but it's up to each person what that means. Ill only really be impressed about Naxx server first kills. The rest is too easy or just no life'in. Naxx seems like a worthy achievement for a guild. Just my 2 cents though, everyone will value different things.
---
hes putting 100$ a week aside and has been doing so and said he will continue until he gets the computer. 3 months of saving and you have a nice laptop with the specs I mentioned
---
Nice!
---
Dedicated means external GPU not internal.
---
Sounds like a dumb system. Should only have one layer. Unless you are a BFA fan then maybe layering makes sense to you.
---
I’m also planning on doing a smite build and I’m very interested in this.
---
Well fuck me, you’re absolutely right  about that one and I’m wrong.
---
Well played.
---
Paladins..they all about that breast cancer awareness.
---

---
Having to play with players where a majority of your server doesn't speak your native language is more invasive than having to play on a server where your ping is ~200ms.
---
For the record, WoW considers a ping of "200ms" to be "good".
---
There was a guild on my server that had a few guest/non-guild spots if you were well known by their members for free, and you could roll for loot they didn't need. I don't know if they sold runs too or not.

I played Uther horde for years. Wahee was my main a tauren druid. I remember this guy. SLAP YOUR BOX INTO THE HANDS OF THE NAKED ROGUE. Or something like that xD

---
Classic isnt based on Legion..
---
If you mean on classic, I can only assume it's because they want to slyly make layering permanent to cut down on server costs, and so they can later hide the sub numbers like they do on retail.
---
They're expecting it to fail, I'm expecting it to succeed.
---
Doubt.
---
Well yeah naturally one layer would be easier

I never realized there was a face in that icon what in tarnation

Sharding is a good idea if you intend players to experience content by themselves. Like no competition for mobs and resources, just the player and maybe one other guy in the area. It seems like blizz thinks socializing is supposed to happen only in guilds.
---
It seems to me that he wants to know how to make a character that looks *exactly* like the gnome that the tauren turns into.  So he's wondering if someone went to the trouble of figuring that out, and put it into a document somewhere; "starting with xfacenojaw, click the face 3x."

Buy a desktop. You will get more for your money, gaming laptops are bulky and the portability doesnt make up for the loss of screen size or a decent keyboard setup.

---
I quit beginning of Cataclysm. I hated lfr and what it did to the social aspect of the game. I also wasn’t looking forward to Mists of Panderia coming out after. I’m coming back for classic and going to be playing with my brother, gf, and her little brother. I’m trying o decide if I want to roll a paladin or warrior. Paladin was my favorite class to play from BC to Wotlk.
---
Ha! Never saw this - good shit.
---
Found the ogre.
---
Both are inside, the difference is one is referred to as the better and the other one is the bad type of GPU.
---
Yes I believe I saw that it was 33% spell power coefficient per charge. I personally think it is all around better than Devouring Plague.
---
I mean you could only use gear you had farmed for but having legit gear vs having someone level 120 farm level 60 content for the same set you put in legit time for... I can see how that would sting a little. 
---
I think it has its place in retail wow. If Blizzard actually gives us RP-PvP realms I’m for sure going to carry around a “business/city” set for RP purposes. 
---
Also, not saying this would happen or that I want it to, but Tmog is classic would be the most fair Tmog to date as you could only Tmog gear you had farmed and only 1-60 content would be available.
---
A lack of evidence is evidence of lack. No one's got a thing for me...

"confirmed"

No, not really. This is just your opinion.

I prefer tft over DU. It has much more polish too. Steal and improve, i guess :p.

Im waiting for the item aquisition rework, which should come soon

do you know if pet damage is considered there, or just other players? for example, lvl 15 shaman tags a bunch of lvl 16 mobs, lvl 40 hunter (not grped with shaman) uses his pet to clear all the mobs.. would the shaman get all the exp?

It's not even an opinion you daft retard, its a decision. That no one gives a fuck about.

Sorry, I had hoped that the ridiculousness of someone saying "all the bugs are fixed" would've made it clear that I wasn't being 100% serious -- if not the fact that I was referring to someone working in a private company as a "prime minister" or the fact that I'd intentionally mixed up the names of two people related to WoW.
---
I don't think the bugs are confirmed gone.
---
yeah that feels not worth it. i guess mining engineering is the move.
---
Only someone very non-inquisitive could think like that. How am I supposed to assume I'm wrong when my thread got about 25 responses, zero of which provided an even slightly compelling argument.
---
It removes the reticle aiming step.
---
I knew you weren't serious, but I didn't know if you were purposefully confusing two people.
---
That doesn't work how you think it works.

Did it happen? Sure.  Was it all you could see in trade chat? No.

probably took them out so the game could be released in CHYNA

You'll hang onto any that you find, but personally I don't buy them off the auction house, unless I'm a healer running dungeons.  They are useful if you get, say, a 2 or 3 pull.
---
Ask yourself. Did this REALLY need to be posted?
---
You obviously know there's questions surrounding the layering situation, otherwise you wouldn't have phrased your title like you did.
---
I'd assume anyone who has paid enough attention would have seen the 100's of posts about it.
---
The fact that YOUR question hasn't been answered doesn't mean the question hasn't been answered hundreds of times this week.
---
This is my exact problem! Although the skinning/tailoring wasn't really something that crossed my mind yet. Great, another option to consider!
---
Keep believing in corporations with terrible track records, I'm sure you'll go far like that. Consider your point, if you ever had one, unmade.
---
Everything on alliance looks tacky.
---
The BWL gear and Horde PvP sets are on goddamn point tho.
---
Melee leeway has been in every version of World of Warcraft ever and still exists in Retail today. It's not going anywhere.
---
You'd be better off just tanking dungeons on the warrior to gear it. Tanks get near-instant groups and dungeon blues keep things pretty much covered.
---
You mean Discrete GPU.
---
Yes. You should expect the Blizzard to begin channeling on your cursor's location immediately when you press the spell.
---
Seems like this would go smoother if -- *rather than being reasonable, like you are* \-- you took a page from OP's book and confirmed whatever intentions you felt were good behind my post ;)
---
Ask yourself, did you REALLY need to reply with your opinion?

Hello,
---
I'm not sure where to begin looking, so i start here on Reddit. I'm looking to make a friend for the release of classic wow to begin my adventures in Teldrassil with. I did not play vanilla back in its day, i started out during mid BC when my brother convinced me to play and made me make a night elf druid(I believe he is a closet furry today, because he has like 10 druids and that's all he plays since the release of vanilla). Anyways, I will be playing a Night Elf Warrior and would love to make a friend that plans to play a druid or priest to begin leveling with. I do not plan to "speed level" to 60, but do plan to keep a steady pace and enjoy the ride. I have played on private servers plenty so the thrill of "whats around the next corner" is lost for me,but i understand how important the leveling process is to the core of the game and love to enjoy the ride while leveling, just not get distracted too much. I don't have much friends to play with, even in retail i'm in my own private guild, sad i know, but the gold keeps me company. I want to meet great adventures along the way and be apart of the community as that is something I feel is lost in retail. If anyone is in the same boat as me and interested in reaching out, please message me.
---
TLDR: Looking to meet a Night elf healer friend to accompany my warrior along our adventures through classic. No speed leveling. Message me for more info.
---
MC Attunement is incredibly easy anyway. Ony attunement takes a bit of time to run through the quest chain. But anybody who has a 60 and also wants to gear that character (especially if it's an alt), are going to get their attunements done regardless.
---
Because dumb people like yourself defend it. It could change if you just chilled out a bit and let people have the classic they wan't not what you personally like because it gives you the sense of a moral highground.
---
the fuck are you talking about?
---
Do you have some resources about that?
---
Thats literally the first time hearing about it while beeing overweight(so everyone tells me what to do to lose weight). What type of fasting? For how long? Wouldnt fat cells just reappear quickly again, or does this take longer than filling existing ones again?
---
im predicting ~50 5th day. Each server will most likely hold 15k players. That is under 1% of the pop. Like .003% doing quick math in my head
---
As far as I can tell, it is entirely based on what percentage of the damage the lower level person does.
---
I asked myself , and the conclusion I arrived at was yes. Something had to be said about this nonsensical post. 
---
But please continue
---
I bet.
---
Tauren because bigger weapon = bigger damage
---
Can confirm
---
Ok thanks guys that definitely points me in the right direction
---
I promise you, your opinion matters to no one. Please continue replying to post because YOU don’t find someone else’s post humoring.

Ah shit, here we go again

---
He can't counter anything I'm saying. Easy win incoming.
---
Sadly, it doesn't work how YOU think it works. I'm just gonna quote myself from another place in this thread and hope Reddit is fine with that.
---
"Even without switching. The idea with layering is to stop the tourists right? So if the server has 5k players that will be in it for the long haul, and only 1% of them are speed levelers, the speed levelers are essentially alone on their own layers and can just gather lotuses and everything else that's rare without competing with the other speed levelers. Say there's 6 layers, that's 6 times less competition for them to deal with."

I would think the majority of people on this sub , not only find this post useless, but slightly annoying.
---
That would be fine if wow were a single player game. Jay Allen Brack has had input as recently as Wrath of the Lich King and he's now like the president of blizzard or something? I don't even know but my point is that guy seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what the MMORPG genre is. I'm just grateful he didn't try to pull the plug on Classic.

these are the hardcore guild 5man team, the few china farmers rotating 24/7, the multiboxing mage and the skilled dedicated speed levelers who is probably doing 36 hours first day, 8 hour sleep then 20 hour per day.

# &lt;Forty Decent People&gt; NA EST Horde PvE Competent Raiding
---
We are an 18+ PvE Horde guild of goal oriented individuals who aim to clear all the PvE content that Classic WoW has to offer, and to have a good time doing it. With the ultimate goal of defeating Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.
---
Leadership is experienced in raiding and we are currently in the process of recruiting more Officers, Raiders, deciding which server to play on, and the guild tabard design. The server will be decided by vote when we are closer to launch.
---
All raid times are EST. We plan to raid 2 nights a week so people do not get burned out. If there is high demand for raids outside of these times, those discussions will be had once phase 4 is on the horizon because clearing MC, Ony, and BWL in two nights is quite doable. Tuesday 7-12PM Thursday 7-12PM
---
Loot will be given out by loot council. Primary decision makers are the Class Officers, with other officers and Master Looter serving as oversight to (hopefully) prevent most dramatically dumb decisions from being made.
---
No single person has ever carried a 40 man raid to victory. You do not need to be an all start to join us. However, you do need to be able to pull your own weight in the raid. If we can assemble 40 people who all pull their own weight, not a single raid boss will stand in our way.
---
If you aren't looking to raid, but want to be a part of a guild of decent individuals to run dungeons with or just hang out, there is room for you in our ranks as well.
---
Please, do not apply if:
---
\- You cannot respect your fellow raiders, even if they have made a mistake that caused a wipe.
---
\- Multiple raid wipes make you emotionally unstable or hopeless.
---
\- You cannot speak on voice coms.
---
\- You feel like playing for 5 hours 2 times a week is too much of a commitment for you.
---
Do apply if:
---
\- You are a relaxed person who's fun to play with.
---
\- You are willing to make a long-term commitment to take down Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.
---
\- You are dedicated to improve and build the raid team with us.
---
If you read this far, you may be the kind of player we are looking for, if you have questions you can ask them in our Discord, post here, or PM me on discord. The "get-applications-here" channel has instructions on how to apply. Everyone who raids with us applies. Even Zver the guild leader.

I didnt hear many good things. People are stil farming azerite. Why do we need endless grind shit wtf. Streamers started multiboxing on stream because the grind is too insane while they mostly did it offstream before. Not sure who tho, its second hand information
---
Because  people act dumb like yourself and defend it. It could change if you just chilled out a bit and let people have the classic they wan't not what you personally like because it gives you the sense of a moral highground.
---
If you are a super casual player and want to do 5 mans, pick a tank, a healer or a Mage. Druid, Warrior, Pally/Shaman or Priest work. Healing or Tanking makes it super easy to do pre-Raid content
---
down voted for truth lol
---
Completely agree.  I thought dynamic respawns would be a good idea until I actually experienced it for myself recently.
---
In addition to the above, respawns can be so fast you get swarmed and killed constantly while trying to quest.
---
It doesn't matter what the purpose of the feature was back in 2004-2006.
---
The debuff limit was a technical failure. The server population limit was a hardware of the times issue.
---
They're still going to be in the game.
---
A lot of these posts read like an 8-year old pretending he's old enough to drink and work wrote them.
---
Yo mama
---
Of course it's original purpose matters.
---
You actually don't think it does?
---
People have developed blood clots from sitting much shorter than that and died, while gaminh.  Sitting for any period say over 4 to 8 hours without getting up can start to creep on dangerous.  None of us are doctors and none of us know what the hell were talking about.
---
u/SockofBadKarma said it better than I ever could:
---
Lok'tar Ogar, brother!
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal efficiency. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job done. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking survive, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara and Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! For the Horde!
---
4chan sure as shit isn't the WoW classic community. 4chan is... 4chan
---
What can i do to prove it? I raided all of Vanilla and TBC. Quit after that. Never resubbed until the classic announcement. Im at work, had this pic saved on my phone, and thought it would be fun to post.  Donno what you want from me.
---
Not the gumdrop buttons!
---
it allows melee to actually harm casters/hunters
---
The first time I shared this opinion, as controversial as it is, my post's score was over 300. The numbers just don't allow for Oceania to have their own server.
---
Oh yeah true, I always get up every hour or so and do some jumping jacks, push-ups, or just walk around a bit to make sure the blood is flowing!
---
If you can't beat classes you counter then you need to learn to play.
---
Oh shit i thought I opened the Staysafe subreddit my b
---
No. I don't care why Blizzard made the decisions in 2004.
---
I only care that Blizzard delivers an experience as close to identical as 2004.
---
How to gain Gmoner rep if the city is a dungeon? Not  troll post, honestly curious.
---
Not exactly a carry sold to me but my weird vanilla story.
---
A guild held a tournament for herb collecting and I was carried through MC/BWL for any and all rogue gear I could've ever wanted. They then actually "hired" me to be their herb farmer and then brought me through AQ40 for all the gear I wanted as well.
---
smart Rankers forms a group quickly to establish points, so we all don't go crazy and can still have our mental health. No need to push beyond 600-750k max. Just making sure no outsider below R12 goes beyond the bracket assigned to them. Any non assigned ranker will be spoken to. Choose to co-operate or get blacklisted from the top premade groups, reducing your chance to ever get R14. You push the envelope, then we hope, we have the power to affect the player in raids/guilds. Talk to their Guild leader and attempt to blacklist the player from all content and rage for the next few weeks when said person sets the tone of 800k+. lol
---
But those are few and far between and usually if they aren't R10-R11, a easy explanation to them will inform them how the system work and they can join the que with us.
---
No need to overwork yourself at R7 with 800k either, waste of time when all you need is a lot less to still move up a rank per week.
---
Fair enough. I think you're in the very small minority and we can safely ignore you as a minority.
---
I can. Sounds like you can’t and are whining for a change
---
Shaman is best class
---
Fascinating.
---
Trolling the internet won't fix your real life issues.
---
you could level holy into consecrate then go right into prot and level like that. I'd only recommend it if you intend to do most of the dungeons to 60 and even then itll be a much slower process than ret. You honestly wont kill things "that" much slower than ret and you can likely take on multiple mobs at once with it which can make some grindy quests possible a bit faster. ultimately just play what you want to play. I was told over and over to never level shaman elemental but I just did on a pserver and it wasnt bad at all. If you really want to play a certain way, play it, fuck the haters, and youll have a good time. just because youre not max efficiency doesnt mean youre doing it wrong. I plan to level a balance druid so we're in it together in playing what we want to play at our own pace :)
---
Quit 4-6 months into BC. I hated that expansion and will stop playing if they force it on us in Classic.
---
The Gnome's city in Classic is Ironforge. They have representatives there with the repeatable cloth turn-in. And every quest you do for an Alliance NPC gives you rep with all 4 factions. If you do one for a gnome, the majority of the rep is for Gnomes, but you still get rep with the other three.
---
Most of them were dumbed down in later patches, but magister's terrace on that little island is still challenging though.
---
For the alliance. Ps I'm so turned on right now. Meet me in my room.
---
No thanks. Blizzards solution is much better than the crap you are suggesting.
---
Don't forget to stop by Lakeshire before you hearth back and sap anyone you find deep diving in the lake.
---
It doesn't matter if I'm in the minority (though I disagree that I am given how much #nochanges gets tossed around).
---
The only opinion that matters is Blizzard's and they've made their stance clear. If it existed in patch 1.12, it will exist in Classic.
---
There is a huge difference between not popping consumables, and not popping a black lotus consumable. You can get a lot of raid consumables before you hit the uncompetitive mafias.
---
Lol if it helps I'm curious why and why you quit
---
How much is this thing, cause that looks amazing, and I travel a lot for work. Bringing my heavy gaming laptop is kind of a chore.
---
Never start a land war in Asia!
---
gear competition.
---
this for 650 will blow classic wow away.  Dont waste too much money on a laptop IMO, they are not meant for "gaming" graphics power.

---
Layering is just cross realm pve change my mind
---
That is a pserver thing though. On retail only the 5 players that actually did the tribute could receive the buffs.
---
That’s actually a pretty good looking helm, 
---
there are hundreds of helms that just look like twigs held together by mud
---
Oh god the furbolg cave at the NE starting zone has a lvl 8 hunter is literally a nightmare.
---
How does it run?
---
Yes there are cases.  You will typically be required to farm a set of resist gear for pve anyways as a warrior.  Fire first, then eventually nature and maybe frost.  If you KNOW what you are going to face it can be worthwhile.  Remember mages get 40 free spell pen from a talent, so anything under that is useless and warlocks if they know what you are doing can curse you for -75 spell pen, but that means giving up another curse.  In addition most casters wore some amount of spell pen in later pvp gear, 30-40 typically just to counter random gear and stuff like mark of the wild.  
---
After you get through any potential spell penetration, the average reduction scales linearly such that each 5 resist is 1.25% average redux against that school at max level, so it takes a lot for it to be noticeable.  
---
Unfortunately for warrior your T1 and T2 sets are terrible for pvp, but other classes could mix and match those sets that are lathered with free resist to push 70-90 of a specific resist without giving up any real stats.
---
get a standing desk.
---
it’s a cash cow
---
Regarding engi ports. Is it requires 300 gnomosh engineering to use or 300 engineering (it may not be 300, but that part is irrelevant to my question). I know the item is BoP. But can I go gnomish, make the dimension ripper, then switch to gob and make that one and be able to use both?
---
Archeus from one of the Dusk Wood questlines is the first I think about for stuff like that. I will never forget the hype versus reality of that weapon
---
You would think so but no. You used to be able to kill civilian children in WoW. They changed it cause it’s illegal in Germany to have violence against children in video games. Did they get their own version? Nope every version got the change.
---
I think it’s a personal preference thing
---
I for one prefer the old undead and Tauren models over the new ones
---
See I think a high pop server is good, maybe like 5-7k, but not the size of nost. I like having to work for some spawns, but when there is a mass of people just standing around waiting for respawns? That bothers me more than layering ever would.
---
Yes, i want to do more. I have many cool ideas. :D
---
Actually i'm playing the witcher for the first time and i agree it will do great for some art pieces! &lt;3
---
Rankers will know by phase 3 who is serious in going to R14. First couple of weeks, we will also see who's putting in the time. It wont be instantly.
---
One indicator I would assume will happen is, right before the start of phase 3, serious rankers would probably be R6-8 depending on length of phase. Most casual pvper will be 3-4.
---
I am sure there will be plenty of World PvP raids forming and some of us will recognizes certain names through time. 
---
Now skills will be judged during phase 3. you can be a serious ranker, but if you suck ass, chances are you're gonna get a vote kick out. 
---
it's not easy to explain the entire process, a lot of it will be - we will see as things goes. Reputation will matter, dedication will matter. Rankers will know who's who in time.
---
It's whole. We never ever had a mega server. If we did once upon a time then I would agree with you.

Don’t forget cross-realm BGs.
---
I’m gonna level at a nice chill pace. Can’t go too hard with gf/work/life but everyone enjoys the game differently, keep on keepin on.
---
For same level mobs, no.  Many people do 5/5 because it gives you a ton of flexibility having extra +hit so that you can kill things higher level then you.  There are sometimes this allows you to complete orange/red quests in an area at the same time as other quests, whereas other classes without high native +hit would have to wait on those harder ones and come back later.
---
ewwwwwwwwwwww
---
Basically it's a super mini lap-top and the game just run on it, not any kind of remote control.
---
i hope a bunch of us.
---
Do you get any FPS drops, or are you streaming it from your home PC to this device?
---
What is this sorcery?
---
I had so much fun tanking heroic shattered halls on my warrior in TBC.
---
HM LK 25 would like to have a word with tou
---
7:45 announce its AQ night, wait till people log off. At 8 go to BWL. Wait until people log back and raid is full. 8:30 go to AQ.
---
And I played on post launch private server. Took me 30+ minutes to finish some quest due to slow respawn and having 15+ players fighting over spawns.
---
I hate how layers will affect the economy. I hope layering doesn’t last long, and is only in low level zones.
---
HOWEVER, if blizzard makes layering last a while, and in prominent zones (Gurubashi arena STV, thorium, and black lotus nodes) I know I’m personally going to try to abuse it as much as I can if it’s implemented. 
---
If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.
---
If blizz wants to make the game work that way, then I’m going to play it that way.
---
It’s not what I want, but it’s what I’m prepared to do.
---
&gt;You would need that cap to be like 40+
---
Liferoot is 40+?
---
Also, you're misunderstanding what I meant by abusing layering to farm mats.  If the best way to farm ore in durotar/arathi etc is to make a low level alt because they're able to layer, then that's what people will do to make money and monopolize the market. 
---
I advocated for a lower level cap so they can ONLY corner the liferoot market in a worst case scenario.  You want it 40+ which brings literally every market into play, so I don't understand why you tried to insult me there when it's your line of thinking that's stupid.
---
You'll have a learning curve but that should be an enjoyable part of the game.  Stick with it and don't let impatient haters get you down.
---
Be communicative and respectful, and help other players when you can.  They will often recipricate.
---
There are a lot of resources out there to help you prepare before launch day.
---
Good luck and have fun.
---
In general no since they rely on a healer to keep them running and the few good resistance pieces that do exist are usually for tanking. 
---
Resistance depends on your resistance stats and the level of whoever throws a spell on you as well as their spell penetration stat. It's also different depending on if that spell is a binary or a non-binary spell. 
---
Binary spells either do the full effect or nothing at all while non-binary spells can do something in between which is called partial resists. So a warlock's fear can either hit or be resisted so it's a binary spell, a shadowbolt can be partially resisted which means it will do 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of its damage. The formula looks like this:
---
 Average Resist Rate of Defender (as a decimal) = 0.75 \* (defenderSpellResistance) / (5 \* attackerLevel) 
---
Average Resist Rate for binary spells means it's the chance for that spell to be completely resisted, while for non-binary spells it's the average damage resisted. 
---
So for a level 63 boss attacking a level 60, say Ragnaros using his knockback on the tank. The formula will look like this:
---
Average Resist Rate = 0.75 \* (defenderSpellResistance/315
---
With 250 resistance you would have: 0.75 \* 250/315 = 59.52% chance of resisting his knockback. 
---
An important thing to note is that you can't go beyond an Average Resist Rate of 75%. How much resistance you need for this cap equals 5 \* AttackerLevel. So cap against a 63 boss is 315. Cap against a level 19 twink is 95.
---
Unfortunately we're not done. In addition to this resistance stat there is a level based resistance that depends on the level difference between you and the attacker, but only affects non-binary spells and can't be removed in any way, shape or form. The formula is easy; just 2% Average Resist Rate per level difference. This is why you see a lot of partial resists when throwing spells at bosses even though you have curse of shadows up. 
---
So if curse of shadows is missing you get the 75 resistance which equals an Average Resist Rate of 18.75% and of course the 10% shadow damage bonus is also missing so your dps is effectively reduced by 28.75%. That's quite a lot so being the only warlock in the raid and having to put up curse of the elements instead of shadows really fucking sucks :(
---
pve: when in doubt, use shadowbolt
---
What gear is available to Moonkin that is not also available to warlocks/mages?
---
That's my point. There never was any integrity if it was split from the start
---
So I’m guessing shadow wands cannot?
---
But those pvps won't be pvping.  They are leveling, if you are an easy target or right in the path they won't care.
---
Ah, see it was a later patch that character looks changed &amp; armor stayed what you were wearing.
---
Both require 260 Engineering.
---
Everlook requires Goblin Engineer.
---
Gadgetzan requires Gnomish Engineer.
---
There should be another stress test in July, no sure the date
---
This is only good on PvE servers. You'll just be getting shit on constantly if you play on a PvP server because you have spirit.
---
That's a real bummer. I prefer gob, but as horde a portal to everlook is near wasteful. I was planning to do alchy/herb anyway. Thanks for the responses fellas.
---
You can kite all mobs from 1-10 without any attacking you.
---
Also from a post last week, apparently they are implementing timers for layer jumping (though no official Blizz announcement).  
---
Those would negate node farming as every jump increase the timer.  
---
Players can still jump away in pvp, but not regularly.
---
Did the source of a spellcast change as well?  It seems to originate behind the caster on beta, making running through an enemy to avoid it pretty difficult.  I don't think it was that hard on retail, but not sure.
---
It’s a music genre.
---
Druid.
---
Wrath and moonfire are your only offensive abilities.
---
Biggest one named hogger.
---
Thank you for such an in depth response.  Gonna save this for sure.  Ele is gonna be so fun
---
Vinyl wrap adds horse power to your car too.
---
How will you get out again after Rotgrip? I heard that the /camp command won't return you to the instance portal. As a warlock I definitely depend on Maraudon runs in phase 1.
---
Red shoes make you run faster
---
Why do you prefer Goblin?
---
WotF is only good against Spriests and Warlock. 25% stun resist is good against nearly every class.
---
That depends a lot on which fight and for most raids it's not really necessary to assign healers.
---
Bottle water and yogurt enemas are really the only way to go
---
This was only the case between 1.10 and the TBC pre-patch, and is considered by many to be a bug. 
---
Didn't PvP at the time, so I'm not sure what the solution was.
---
You should have known you'd get a hostile reaction when you attempted to supplant His Holiness Pope Street with the pretender JAB.
---
You dont think they have current bot recognition tech going into the game?
---
I dont recommend spending less than 400
---
its foolhardy to buy anything less
---
Typical funboy clown who follows ololol one shot movies
---
I actually raced him a few times back in the day. One time I was within one level of him around \~45. I  can assure he was a big deal. It often ended up with them 8+ levels faster than 2nd place.
---
If you want to tank just tank. Not every guild is going to be a no-lifer guild coming from the private servers. If you show up to the raid early and have the bare minimum of things needed you're basically more valuable than 60% of the people who're gonna be in your 40-man raid anyways.

Stopped playing later in WOTLK because the game had lost what made it fun; it no longer felt like an immersive adventure.
---
I’m excited for the game but damn get some balance to your life. This won’t be enjoyable long term.
---
Playing ffxiv right now and the new expansion is ok but man I just miss the community of people talking and shit, no one ever wants to talk to a stranger at all and I hate cross realm duty finder. Once classic drops my life is gonna be ruined lol
---
Take the pants.
---
The added dps from staff of westfall is worth about 6.5 str(for warrior 7str=1dps).  While point for point I'd take str over stam, the gap is not huge and the other two weapons almost make up for that str loss in stam added.  The blue pants are then another 6-10 stats added over whatever greens you likely would have as well as some same hidden value in the extra armor.
---
China used to get its own version of undead and other corpsy gore due to cultural taboos against coprses and corpsy gore. I don't see why they wouldn't also get their own version with blood removed or rendered totally transparent.
---
Let the rage fuel you. HATE YOUR PAIN AND IT WILL CEASE TO EXIST!
---
You will have 500 mage/hunters/warlocks LF tank
---
Agreed. AQ40 and Naxx are where you really can't mess around. Some can do it, but they have to be very well equipped.
---
earing is gay, but alli dont use anal beads?
---
&gt; But I’ll never group up with a warrior who’s equipping staff of westfall or emberstone staff
---
rejects others for no good reason, surprised at own rejection
---
I think the rivalry between Goblins and Gnomes plays out well in Vanilla WoW. They don't really care about Horde vs Alliance, just each other, so of course they want their inventions and methods to be preferred by all other engineers, regardless of faction. It's Linux vs Windows, not Russia vs USA.
---
Spirit is trash for Warriors, idk how people keep saying this.
---
Str = more damage = killing mobs faster and makes you not an absolute dumpster in PvP.
---
They are actually quite weak, but people seem to believe that they are completely op and they are in a 1v1 or even 1v2 situation. In battlegrounds they hardly do anything against a competent team. BUT! Most people don't know that they are weak.. Most people turn tail and run the other way if an infernal or a doomguard runs at them. So the pure psychological effect is something to be considered. Me and a shadowpriest held GM against 7 people because my infernal scared off half their group. It's like people just freeze when they see it, maybe because it's such a rare sight. I also once defended the gates of Stormwind with an infernal. A relatively small Horde raid were at the gates trying to push into the market, I hid in the cheese shop and dropped an infernal on their raid. They all immediately ran back out the gates without even hitting the infernal.
---
Then you try and pull it out against a premade and the infernal hardly lands before it's instantly nuked down or banished.
---
Thanks to your comment, I am not clicking on that link
---
Especially considering so many classic veterans are in their late 20's and early 30's now. Long play periods plus lots of fast food will definitely result in a few heart attacks!
---
That's kinda how I feel, as well. I want to play a role that is useful to everyone. I'm torn between prot warrior and warlock.
---
This is good
---
Hunter is amazing solo, and warrior is terrible at it.  You will likely slow him down, and he will likely speed you up.  
---
Prot is not much an advantage while leveling, you will struggle more with threat then damage redux 1-59, and prot is more focused on redux.
---
On my server I don't remember too many selling runs. But I do remember a lot of guilds selling Eye's and leaf's they didn't need. All it took was a quick summon in.
---
OP, this is one of the most entertaining posts I’ve read in a long time!!
---
In vanilla you could not, but this is one of the things they left in from the current client as seemingly everyone used an addon that gave the functionality.
---
Just a weekly reminder for those interested. Come check out /r/wow for what post-Naxx will actually look like (if there's any post-Naxx at all).
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Holy paladin, frost mage(kinda), disc priest(kinda), marks hunter, and as you said SM/ruin.  Then about 10 more that work, but are clearly inferior pve specs and you can just kinda get away with it.
---
Take a look at an empty game if you want no post naxx content lol. Elitist pricks everywhere in this sub
---
Great post. Kids nowadays dont know what mowing for money is anymore. Jam to my new found glory on my cd player and giant crappy headphones.
---
I am there with you 100%. I actually had the same pattern as you - my interest peaked with TBC and Ulduar was amazing. Good times. Hope you enjoy classic!
---
That sucks
---
I'm looking forward to my gear not getting reset every 3 months.  I can play Classic off and on for years and never have to start over like with the modern game.
---
Hey thanks for the reply! I have to admit that I've been shying more and more away from 0/22/29, especially after reading (lower on this same page) how little Improved Weapon Totems actually does.
---
The only thing I couldn't find in your incredibly informative post was your opinion on 30/0/21, the Ele/Resto PvP hybrid that is supposedly, based on googling, adequate to clear T1/T2. 
---
Outside of that, correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is now:
---
0/5/46 is what I'm expected to run as a "Resto Shaman" in raids
---
0/12/39 is good for *healing* PvP as it gives PvP-useful bonuses in defense and healing. No offensive capability
---
0/22/29 is good in one niche scenario, kinda
---
*30/0/21 will gimp me in raids but is the best for offense in PvP, solo WPvP, soloing in general,* ***and should be enough to clear T1/T2 if I'm just looking for PvP gear***
---
Woah dude
---
It is not at all out of the realm of possibility that Blizzard will just shut Classic down after a couple years. Especially if they successfully convert Classic players to Retail, which they are definitely intending.
---
thats just like your opinion man. id rather have the low ping.
---
I'm not taking PTO, or playing any marathon sessions. Prolly just some trader Joe's soda water or black coffee for the 1-3 hours I get a day!
---
I dont intent on levelling more than 2 characters, i dont want to spend 2 months levelling my first character, and then gearing it up just to find out i picked the wrong realm and it dies, id sooner quit than spend another 2 months levelling and gearing up my main.
---
When I first read this I was like "So... what? 3 hours?" Then I realized I wasn't on /r/wow
---
Dear god
---
I got into classic as aq40 launched. Raided everything up to patchwerk in naxx when BC came out.  That's when i got my first taste of expansion acorn. Replacing all that raiding gear with greens sucked.
---
BC was interesting because i loved the content,  but flying mounts killed so much world pvp. I hated resilience. I quit before clearing black temple.
---
Came back during wotlk because it was gifted to me. I leveled,  raided, quit again. 
---
I want an end game.  I want the things I do to have a lasting value. I want to work on a character for months, take a break and come back to it still being viable years later. I want to learn other classes without fear of falling behind. I want people to feel like their actions have consequences in the community because not everything is randomly matched up.
---
Too bad. People won't like that. Not very classic.
---
Why? It means you'll have the best possible server population. It means your community will be THE community, at least for your region. Why do you care how many realms there are?
---
Woah dude totally not photoshopped even just a little. Woah. This is le epic.
---
And I'd rather have updated graphics, but time and time again, Blizzard has shown us that they don't really care about what players want.
---
Run back to a major city every time you ding to simulate training every few levels.  
---
Disallow yourself from dropping the first 6 white and grey items you pick up since vendoring to simulate quest items being stored in your inventory.
---
BFA too, right? With Kul Tiras at least?
---
Sorry to hear about that last part man, I hope someday you gain that courage. Fatherhood is worth it.
---
a great name for great men
---
Holy shit... I've played wow since day one and I never realized that was a face in the helmet.. always thought it was just part of it Haha
---
play on some pservers to get a feel for it
---
Engineering is the best profession you can have for both pve and pvp if you are looking to min-max
---
All that spell damage leather?  So basically only AQ set pieces and a couple others?
---
Not like they have a choice lol
---
People already casually throwing out mental disorders like psychopathy lmao
---
As others said this is more EVE Online kind of stuff. I don't remember this happening with raiding guilds in vanilla but then I didn't raid in vanilla or pay much attention to my guild's raid shenanigans. I've seen this kind of thing in other MMOs and your mileage may vary, it really depends on how seriously people take the game. You might take care in a game like WoW where community is important and people are kind of ready to trust. This doesn't feel like the kind of cutthroat atmosphere for these kinds of shenanigans. If you're concerned about genuinely hurting feelings with this, well, you might.
---
I don't think WoW is that kind of cutthroat game. For all our bluster about cross-faction collusion and red=dead arguments between PvP and PvE servers, this is some next level drama that I don't think this playerbase is really looking for.
---
Others mention WC1 is very dated which is true, but I have it and have played it and enjoyed it. If you like RTS games I think it's worth checking out.
---
That's so fucking nice man! But i how does it run? Smooth af or kinda laggy? I'd play that on the go everyday can i have the name of the thing pls?
---
There's an innate 5% stun resist for all classes so it's 30% with hardiness , if you add the iron will talent (15% extra stun resist) with the orc racial you can almost resist stuns half of the time, it's quite significant.
---
Wingclip is all a hunter is good for in raids besides tranq so ye improve it
---
I had a buddy back in the day that would just dominate the deadly blunderbuss supply. Everyone wanted one for the quest in ashenvale and he just set the line at always buying any that appeared below 3g and sold them all for 5g (or whatever it was) and he was always filthy rich. He’d also just play the wool/silk game and rake in cash. Not sure how our knowledge today is going to make the general population any better equipped to deal with the actual economy when people are still able to manipulate it this way
---
By being really really brave and stuff
---
Watch out for the centaur patrol
---
Pick up WC3 of you can. Great campaign and story missions. and there is still an alive online community for custom games.
---
Would be good but you're a wisp and not a ghost.
---
1. Many has answered SM/Ruin and that spec works fine in both PvE and PvP, especially in premades. However I just want to shine some light on a much lesser known spec called [MD/Ruin](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/-205030313250105-54500051000001) which is a variant of DS/Ruin. Essentially you sacrifice improved corruption and improved life tap to get Master Demonologist. This is a super cool talent because it turns your demons into so much more than just a tank, stamina buffer or charmer. In raids you'll DS your succubus for the 15% extra shadow damage, your lifetaps are not as good and corruption is a bit unwieldly but can be used. DPSwise the casting time on corruption goes from 1,5 seconds up to 2 seconds which is not a huge amount. In PvP you can use it to great extent with a succubus, giving you both the 10% *to all* damage including fire so you can get some pretty powerful soulfires off. The spec is primarily used for tanking Twin Emperors though as the felhunter gives you 60 resistance to all spellschools. I quite like the spec because I can use my demons to tailor my playstyle. On threat sensitive fights like Lashlayer or Huhuran I can use the imp (20% threat reduction) for about 30% of the fight and the use the Fel Domination cooldown to instantly summon a succubus and DS her for the 15% shadow damage buff for the remainder of the fight. I wouldn't recommend using it on progression raids though since you really want to optimise your class there. Except of course if you're tanking Twin Emps and are struggling with shadow resistance gear.
---
2. In PvE you will be assigned a curse and told to keep it up, though if there are more than three warlocks you might no have to do this. Then you'll look for targets to dot up with corruption. The main target is usually quite contested with debuffs so try and look for other targets like adds or just other trash mobs. Then you spam shadowbolt while snapshotting shadowburns whenever possible.   
---
PvP is very situational and highly depends on your spec/gear. An SL/NF warlock is great for guarding the flag room or bases in AB while SM/Ruin is better at singling out a target and nuking them with huge shadowbolt crits. Conflag or the Drakedog build is more for duelling and world PvP but it can also be used in BGs although it's hard to pull off. Notable scenarios include targeting down a potential flag runner with the soulfire combo, group with someone and be able to easily go 2v5 or even 2v6 to cap a base and just generally have fun blowing people up in BGs even though it's probably not that helpful to winning the match.   
---
3. It is certainly not the easiest class to play well. In raids you have huge issues with threat, especially on Horde side. Knowing when you can afford to risk more threat while not pulling aggro is a huge part of the warlock playstyle and it's something you'll learn from experience.   
---
You also have to deal with the perception of warlocks being inherently inferiour dps classes and mostly brought for buffs and summons. Way too many guilds give all the good caster loot to the mages instead, if that happens then you should confront the guild about it because it's unacceptable. Some items are much better for mages though, like the trash rings from AQ40 and Naxxramas, but if the Neltharion's Tear keeps going to the mages then it's a pretty bad sign.
---
&gt;People will pass you by even for dungeons
---
This is the only part I disagree with. Assuming someone rolls a warrior to tank and also tanks instances on the way to 60, they'll likely make friends who will continue to want them to tank. I feel like people run into issues only when they quest their way to 60 as fury then decide it's time to start gearing up as a tank.
---
BC heroics on launch where really hard, i think cataclysm had the hardest heroics to date right?
---
How's that?
---
"nothing MY team couldnt handle, with my EPIC priest" w0ah settle down buddy, you arent a legend
---
Race and playtime are 2 different things
---
Yeah, he's pretty awesome!
---
na, maybe dont stand still and instead weave ur aa’s between ur movement like a real hunter
---
Hey thanks man, glad you enjoyed it!
---
Not saying it’s bad, saying WOTF is pretty decent. No one specs Iron Will though. If you’re prot you’re doing it to raid, not PvP.
---
Thanks dude, you too!
---
That is literally what I'm saying to do.
---
I mean you could take an actual vacation. That would solve both problems you've posed
---
Thing is the goblins don't care, but the gnomes are firmly alliance. It's weird that they'd sell horde their technology is all.
---
Holy shit J!nx.... That's a blast from the past.
---
Well played!
---
It is known
---
\&gt;  I think layering is going to be in classic forever   
---
They have already given world bosses of Phase 2 as a hard deadline on layering. They know that the lively hood of the game is appeasing the nochanges crowd, they aren't going to go back on that deadline.
---
It doesn't
---
You should be fine and it sounds like you got a good head on your shoulders, just don't be weirded out if people get a little peeved that you don't have mana tide totem. I personally don't think pumping 22 points into enhance just to get a relatively small improvement to the 3-4 melee in your group is worth it. If you want to pvp go ele/resto
---
Right? Acting like wow was the first MMO released. 
---
Bruh, a lot of people grew up playing EQ or DAoC. Oh, leveling a warrior in classic wow was hard? Lmao
---
A throwing weapon will never do as much damage as hunter can put it out before the mob gets in range for melee. Also backstab isn’t possible solo leveling without gouge or another cc.
---
that's deep
---
wrong sub
---
They should yes, its not great gold making though and you can usually make more by farming certain mobs. But if you like finishing quest chains its some nice extra moneys
---
Is it native even now in retail? I've never seen it outside of an addon
---
Literally the same resource exploiting happens. Monopolies of devilsaur and black lotus were not carried out by a few friends, but a more organized group. By having A, B, and C, they will just have their operation spread a little thin at first.
---
Yeah the debate now is really 30/0/21 or deeper resto for me haha :P
---
I was under the mistaken impression that IWT would be a pretty noticeable DPS gain and that's why speedrunners used it, but the gain is just miniscule
---
X
---
This’ll be it. Classic will also have a pretty severe player drop off once it’s been out for a month or two and people realize classic wow isn’t their kind of game. Wouldn’t be surprised if half the population didn’t even make it to 60 before quitting.
---
In my opinion nearly every raider than can should have engineering. The exception to this is that you want someone to be skinning and definitely some enchanters in your guild. But they can still choose engineering as their second option.
---
Don't know what I'm looking at.
---
Everyone has the same sized mounts except gnomes and taurens have bigger mounts.
---
Not I.
---
Some Goblins care. There's Wenikee Boltbucket that gives quest in a Horde village in the Barrens. And the entire Copperpinch family/clan shows up in various Horde-only places.
---
And some Gnomes definitely don't care. The Shimmering Flats guys are just interested in their racers, they have no interest in any war.
---
Oce will be getting offical servers a method streamer confirmed it and i truly think we will have them may only be 1 or two but
---
Yes, You can tank as a non-prot spec, nearly everyone does while leveling.
---
you can heal as a non healer spec too, i did it, its just a little more difficult but doable for sure
---
Wtf are these threads
---
lol, "a method streamer confirmed it"
---
Retard alert
---
,  .
---
Can we get a frost mage virgin fire mage Chad meme?
---
I think it's about time for one XD
---
You’ll have a much easier time finding a desktop or maybe even a smaller tower(mini pc), as adding a dedicated GPU to any laptop will really increase the price a lot. I feel like there are definitely some cheap desktops for around $250 that would be perfect
---
Catch up mechanics made me quit.
---
bet you think WoW as the first MMORPG
---
when in reality it was the least MMORPG calling itself an MMORPG on the market when it released
---
I quit because I was overweight and the game became a chore (Cata I think). It was a continuous cycle of working, getting home and smoking, followed by WoW late night. One day, I got so fed up with it, I just quit the game. Started going to the gym, ate healthier, and became a new person. Although at the time it was fun, there wasn’t balance in my life. 
---
Looking forward to coming back to this game, with a new healthy mindset and body. This game still to this day is my favorite game I’ve ever played. Just make sure to find balance in your WoW journey, take care of business first so you can enjoy the game.
---
How did you manage to die as a hunter?
---
Hunter, Holy paladin, Fire mage, Holy/Disc Priest, Resto shaman, Resto druid, Combat sword rogue (there more like a warrior and less stealth rogueish) prot warrior (in AV you need some tanks)
---
That being said though 0 of the pve raid specs are among the "top tier" pvp specs although some come close
---
He's pretty mechanically skilled. A player like this is gonna crush Joana's record from 2006.
---
It depends on the fight. Some fights, like sulfuron harbinger you will have like 5 people tanking. But typically for a 1-tank fight, you will have a few healers on the main tank and everyone else healing everyone. Some fights like the first boss in BWL you may even split your healers up into quadrants of the room. Typically a 40 main raid runs something like 10-13 healers
---
I think so. I am far from a druid expert, but [there are people who seem to know what they are talking about who are optimistic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGo5SMeqgo). 
---
This guy is a raid tank with a lot of private server experience that intends to roll druid at launch and raid as a druid tank, before transitioning to a secondary warrior character in later phases.
---
lmao
---
Mostly fun man, the real fun is enslaving elite demons in dungeons/world
---
You're very very wrong. But hey, you go girl.
---
All Canadians know how to ask to go to the bathroom in French thanks to middle school French classes but not too many actually speak it outside of Quebec lol
---
ahh, i would be interested in a fresh server and enjoying the journey how everyone else did on launch.
---
You can’t dungeon with us!!!!!!!!!
---
pretty sad how subreddits are used as burns.
---
Do remember that spriest in classic do not return mana to group as they do later on. I play spriest on a private server and spend a lot of time using my wand in raids 🤓.
---
Sometimes r/wow gets random shit like this (people think the sub means "Wow!", like surprising photos or something).
---
But on r/*classic*wow? Uh. Good question
---
Last boss in UBRS. Other than that the amount of Bosses you will kite is pretty low. You will be kiting trash (unless you have a bunch of hunters). For instance a lot of the trash packs near the end of AQ40 are absolutely beastly so my guild had 2 hunters kite 2 of the mobs while we killed the rest
---
Play alliance lock if you want, probably go gnome as they have a good pvp racial and a decent pve racial for locks. Yes, engineering is king. If you pve at some point you will want to level tailoring for the set bonus on bloodvine set (when ZG comes out)
---
Everyone knows Arcane is the best leveling spec!!
---
How the fuck can anyone play any game like that?
---
What's it like only tanking dungeons 1-60 then switching to dps when I start to raid? Will I need to be super committed to do that or will I be fine with only around 15 hours a week?
---
You want to keep tailoring for PVE for bloodvine set bonus. You will most likely wear bloodvine untill you get 6 set T3 (or possibly some AQ gear)

Stop trying to make ret happen. It's not going to happen.

I did the feral thing in vanilla. It is perfectly viable on all non-raid content and arguably usable in raids. Even if a guild accepts you as a tank, you will heal some encounters and de-curse in others.

November 2017, so 20 months.

Where are you seeing orb of deception for 2000g?

Sandals man?
---
Get over yourself. It's the internet.

Thanks! Hopefully they move that stuff to phase 2 instead.

There's literally videos, full videos, of guilds clearing these dungeons faster than you purport them being possible to clear in. You can just search them and prove yourself wrong in seconds ...

:NA:  \*\*\[Salt Miners\] \[Horde-PvP\]\*\* :NA: 
---
\*\*Introduction:\*\*
---
Salt Miners is currently a small group of friends who have played WoW since Vanilla. We collectively have done everything the game has to offer at the highest tier. From grinding rank in the vanilla honor system, top 100 world raiding and pushing glad. We are going to be a mainly pve focused guild with an emphasis on getting shit done. In this day and age no one wants to waste their time wiping to boss mechanics that are older than some of the people in the guild (JK no kiddos). We are pushing to be the top Horde guild on our server. Leadership has the skill and experience to execute our goals for the entirety of Classic.  We need like minded and skilled people to fill our ranks to achieve this goal.
---
\*\*Experience:\*\*
---
Leadership has cleared all the Vanilla content back in Vanilla except Saphron and Kel’Thuzad.
---
\*\*Loot:\*\*
---
Loot will be handled via loot council based on guild needs, player contributions and player effort into gearing and min-maxing their character for progression. Attendance, guild activities and performance are important.
---
\*\*Schedule:\*\*
---
Tuesday and Wednesday 10PM EST - 2AM EST at the latest. Days are subject to change based on overall player feedback but this is what we are shooting for.
---
Optional Saturday raids will happen when we have the people to do so.
---
\*\*Expectations:\*\*
---
Show up to raid on time as the spec you were recruited as with consumables when deemed necessary by officers.
---
\*\*Apply at: \*\*

Unless he has Death Wish + rage to use it.
---
Fury warriors may suck in PvE but they hardcounter locks and shadowpriests (two of the strongest classes) with their sheer output and fear immunity.
---
I want my Pink Mageweave Shirt back!
---
there will be more mages but a raid will take more mages than locks. locks are subpar dps but provide other utilities like summoning, soulstones &amp; healthstones, as well as banishing on some fights.
---
they are similar playstyles in PvE but in PvP it they are quite different, mages frontload their damage and use their overwhelming control to kite enemies whereas locks will face tank and sometimes use control but mostly just dot people up and try to keep range if they can.
---
No there should be one. Blizzard shouldn't change the game based on player preference, they should deliver the game as close as possible to its 1.12 version.
---
You shouldn't speak about transmog in this sub at all, brother. Most pf us never wanted it and will never have it.
---
So....if you’re a paladin, how are you a dps?
---
You can’t just ask someone why they’re a dps!
---
Quit playing regularly during 3.3
---
Never played more than 2 months at a time since.
---
\&gt; easily  
---
Not easy. Lots of coding.
---
For sure. I was incredibly happy when they added vampiric touch in bc
---
I got downvoted for some reason. Just another spriest main trying to pass along the good word. (We rock in tbc).
---
Willwill of the forsaken.
---
Play a tank if you want to regardless what you play with 10hrs a week your limited in how far youll go in content. Doubt you'll do an MC or 40mans until later phases. Your first raid will probably be ZG. And thats fine. Everyone wants tanks for dungeons even if you can only do 1 or 2 a night slow n steady grind:)
---
Yes the servers couldn't handle more than 4k but that was more people than they wanted anyway. The 3k cap was a design decision and had nothing to do with hardware limitations.
---
And even if it was, the debuff limit WAS a technical limitation that they wanted gone and they're even putting that back in.
---
So yeah, no changes. Play retail or some pirate server if you don't like Classic.
---
Runescape sells additional action bars as a microtransaction. Yeah, I really don't think the Mom &amp; Pop Corner Store of MMO's has anything to teach the Walmart of the industry.
---
Will there be us morning raid guilds?
---
Better question would be for how long does it run...
---
The WC1 and WC2 campaigns are structured in such a way that if you play the Horde, the Horde win the war outright, if you play Alliance, the Alliance win the war outright.
---
They retconned the stories so that both are effectively true. WC1, chronologically, most of the Human missions should occur first, where the last mission doesnt occur at all (the human final victory). Its retconned so that the Horde regrouped after their first failed attacks and the Horde missions occur after the Human campaign (with maybe a few of the early Horde mixed in chronologically with the Human missions)
---
WC2 is pretty similar, except chronologically most of the Human and Horde missions are intermixed. The final Horde mission occurs, but according to canon, they fail and then the final few Human missions should occur. For BtDP, all the missions are intermixed chronologically, both Horde and Alliance victories are canon (with alterations). Lots of history with major characters like Medivh and Deathwing were significantly changed.
---
I feel WC1 doesnt really hold up much at all. AI is terrible, resources are in awkward locations, UI is difficult to use. WC2 is still OK, but most missions take tremendous amounts of build up time to beat the AI. Like all older RTS games, missions are almost all simply, destroy enemy base, or bring unit to target location (which usually requires you to destroy at least 90% of the enemies on the map).
---
Because horde always travel in packs and ride single file to hide their numbers.
---
I would argue that Stratholm, Scholomance and Maraudon prepatch were harder. I remember going Strat/Scholo with 10 people. I don't remember to have any struggles in BC heroics.
---
Who cares, you're gonna be OOM in 10 seconds no matter what you do as a spriest. :)
---
Bro this is the type of shit moms worried their sons are being sucked intov
---
Nope! There's a neutral Human "Warlock" who acts as a quest point for a handful of pets as well as the level 31 robes (I forget the name of the robes but they had sweet stats).
---
Druid healers actually often wear/need cloth drops (so competing with priests), and there's a bunch of things like weapons, trinkets, rings, capes, etc. that are not armor class dependent. Obviously there will be gear they are guaranteed to get, but not a lot of it compared to other classes.
---
&gt;What?
---
The utility abilities that were listed (in addition to other reasons you'd want some druids like Mark) don't scale with gear at all. Look into the formulas if you'd like, big utilities like Innervate and Rebirth are not going to be scaling with some awesome new int/spirit + healing power gear piece :P
---
Anything is hard when you pug 30 people
---
I get your point, but that's a really bad comparison. Both BF and CoD are online team-based(mostly) shooters that follow the "realistic" route with extremely accurate weapons and very low TTKs.
---
I guess CoD doesn't have vehicles.
---
exploit -  *verb -*  make full use of and derive benefit from (a resource).
---
Are you crazy? Private servers get as much as 14k....
---
You are way off, mate
---
Some people really want TBC. Some people really want WotLK. Some people want Classic to fix Retail and then have the playerbases merge on a new expansion.
---
Maybe they should listen to people who know about this stuff then, honestly..
---
The dungeon sets actually take a ton of time and effort.    
---
Dungeon Set 1 will take months alone, then you'll be able to start the Set 2 quest lines. The quest line itself is pretty epic and also has reputation requirements. See this for a brief overview: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dungeon_Set_2   
---
Pretty perfect for causal players. Since you only need to find 5 man groups for popular dungeons and the rare group for a special event.
---
&gt;  few months that 20,000 server will be 2,000.
---
whatever mate.... 
---
 you dont know jack shit about this stuff, sorry to tell you...
---
The game was vastly different at launch, it's like comparing BFA and Everquest or even Ultima Online. Still, would be an interesting experience. I guess the closest thing to that would be to check out Dual Universe or Starcitizen if they ever get released.
---
You want a sans-serif font that's easy to read. Something like Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica.

He is in his mind.
---
Damage per mana comparing frostbolt to 3 target AE.
---
**lvl 14**
---
FB - 1.09 DPM
---
AE - 1.38 DPM
---
28% increase in efficiency (not to mention you are draining mana and gaining exp faster)
---
**lvl 22**
---
FB - 1.2 DPM
---
AE - 1.51 DPM
---
25% increase in efficiency
---
**lvl 32**
---
FB - 1.4 DPM
---
AE - 1.64
---
17% increase in efficiency
---
There seems to be a downward trend, but AE will kill the mobs faster, more of your time proportionally is spent drinking (50% time drinking, 50% fighting for example) but although you drink for a larger portion of your time, you are also spending less time casting so your spirit is more powerful than when it is a mage who is casting several spells over the course of fighting 3 mobs, interrupting the 5 second rule constantly.
---
If AE ever becomes so close to frostbolt that things like shatter combos or ice shards might tip the favor in FB's scale you can then just pull a 4th mob, or alternate between which is better (alternating happens anyways).
---
I got no addons for that and I can see if someone is having a heal cast on him.
---
His HP bar gets another green bar (different shade) which signals an incoming heal but it does not tell you what kind of heal it is.
---
On retail that is.
---
Gee, let's see.  I started about halfway into TBC, "quit" about 3/4 of the way into Lich King for a woman who ended up not sticking around.  Played a little through Cataclysm, skipped the pandas, came back for the expansion right after pandas, then quit for good a few weeks into that.  Have messed around a bit on private servers since but nothing serious.  Staunchly refused the idea of Classic WoW when I first heard about it several months ago and maintained that stance for a long while, until about 2-3 weeks ago.  Now I'm grinding hardcore on a vanilla private server to get re-acquainted with my favorite class (druid) while also mapping out my leveling game plan so that when Classic drops I can be there at Minute One with a complete blueprint laid out for what I'm about to do.  Already requested that whole week off from work, too.
---
The 0.5 sets aren't coming out until Naxx, so they're not really an option.
---
I played a paladin in vanilla and swapped to ret for a small period. I always had a bit of latency and I was running next to casters trying to hit them. I would be RIGHT on top of them and it would say I am too far away. I don't remember any leeway helping me back then.
---
Dungeon Set 1 will be in the game when it releases. As I said above that will take you months to complete by itself.
---
I played about a month of Cata, something was just different after WotlK so I stopped playing. Came back for BfA, played for a month and quit again. When epics become more common then greys and whites? It's a solo player ez loot give away, anyways found it boring AF
---
I'll be back for classic. Can't wait
---
There's a... 30 percent chance that I'm already raiding.
---
quit around MoP, what a meme expansion... Plus to me, the game had changed so much I couldn't take it anymore. 
---
I will be back for classic and any other legacy wow/warcraft content they plan to release.
---
Zug zug
---
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
---
The tier 0 sets absolutely suck.
---
This thing is GPD Win2 and here is the video https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6twvw/wow_classic_beta_on_gpd_handheld/
---
I played both sides back then, and if the player base will be anything like it was back then, then I will 100% go Horde.
---
Playing Private server so who knows if it's accurate, but 1.12 the dude in the barrens was just like here you go buddy
---
Console
---
You obviously didnt play tbc heroics before it all got nerfed :)
---
Blackout is good no doubt, and I feel the argument for some more gimped specs to need to roll a certain way for pvp viability, but you should basically dominate same level pvp as shadow priest.  You should be most worried about higher level gankers and then the +hit for your CC like fear and silence is as important as a blackout chance.  
---
Also since the +hit more directly increases your leveling speed, if you are first wave leveling reduces the number of people who've possibly out leveled you.
---
&gt;the only continuing source of gold in the world is vendor trash.

and quest rewards and mobs drops.

You could put kalamber one just one planet in star wars Galaxies.  Thats how big the planets were.
---
I will be playing on the US servers as the only reason I will be playing is to rejoin my old guildies (who were part of a late night US raiding guild). This time around they will be playing at more US friendly times which translates to 11am Sydney time. I can flex my work schedule to make it work but if it proves to difficult I am sure there will be Aussie guilds out there with a raiding agenda in mind.
---
If they made a comeback, the video's would go insane.
---
Will it run fine on a 2018 MBP 13” base?
---
Where is the nearest graveyard for horde in westfall?
---
For me it just isn't such a big deal. It will be gone anyway before phase 2. I am super exited to get into game and sure I do wait day when layers are removed and we have non layered servers again. But I am quite fed up that every single day someone makes same post about how layering destroys the game.
---
Think you mean the world of warcraft retail community on what they expect from classic.  The classic community at least all the old players from the original vanilla wow already know what to expect.
---
I’m pretty sure the issue with Paladin and Shaman loot dropping for the wrong faction was patched out.
---
When layering is removed I guess we'll see, because there's going to be a couple fairly popular servers. I don't think Blizzard will want to have people wait in long queues since layering is being used.
---
I simply said "*I want*, doesn't mean I'm not going to play and enjoy Classic if the servers are capped to 2,500-3,500.
---
Fuck all mages AoE grinding. Kill on sight for me.
---
Barrens Chat will not be the same.
---
Pretty sure a lot of that is personal experience from those people projecting onto the entire player base. Most of the time I see this from people who were in middle school or high school during vanilla. They were just dumb kids and so were their IRL friends so surely all the rest of the players must have been also.   
---
In my raiding guild in vanilla the vast majority were pretty serious gamers who were in college. Hell, I am pretty sure that just about none of the officers were more than a couple years south of thirty.
---
Region: NA / Faction: Horde / Server Type: PVP / Goal: Casual-core? raiding / Class: War (negotiable)
---
Me: 40 y/o gamer with a real life who wants to raid hardcore enough to see all content (yes, including AQ40 and Naxx), but not to go after speed runs or realm firsts. Semi-hardcore, depending on your definitions.
---
I joined the game well after vanilla. I'm currently a CE raider with some p-server experience. Ideally looking to tank as war, but would consider lock or any healer class for the right guild. Some combination of M/W/F/Sa preferred. Team player.
---
Implementing a system that's already enacted is ridiculous enough. Having to choose the "lesser" of evil is exactly what allows blizzard to get away with what they want. Its obvious from their actions alone what they think of their consumers base. You and many others are enabling it and swallow it all.
---
&gt;Everyone wanted one for the quest in ashenvale and he just set the line at always buying any that appeared below 3g and sold them all for 5g
---
given it can be crafted for a handful of silvers I would've put like 10 of those on AH for 3gold every day
---
Private server experience won’t translate to Classic. There’s already issues with feral DPS, from what I’m hearing. You won’t be a MT as a Druid, you’ll be an OT and needed for several fights, but you won’t be a guild’s main tank.
---
Hi hearing. you won’t be a mt as a druid, you’ll be an ot and needed for several fights, but you won’t be a guild’s main tank., I'm dad.
---
If you are not hardcore or at least semi-hardcore you will eventually be behind, period. It’s not retail where casuals have the same gear as hardcores, no, the more you play the better gear you have basicly. That doesn’t mean that you won’t have ppl to play with cuz there is gonna be ton of casuals looking for pugs or even guilds aswell. Raids need 40ppl and guilds need casuals for benching aswell. This game IS for casuals aswell just dont expect running around with sulfuras or windseeker
---
Maybe important dungeon quest chains (ie were to pick up)?
---
Genious name, good sir!
---
I would say you will easily have 100s of hours (possibly even thousands) of content per character total. As for endgame PVP, you probably wont have a spot on any of the top premade groups. If you are on a healthy server, you should have no trouble solo que and being useful in PVP. 
---
Endgame PVE for casual will be Blackrock Depths, Lower Blackrock Spire, Upper Blackrock Spire (10 man), Dire Maul, Scholomance, Stratholme (Live), Stratholme (Undead), PUG Molten Core, PUG ZG, PUG Onyxia. In addition, you can explore level 60 zones and complete endgame quests in places like Plaguelands and Silithus. 
---
I would say there is plenty to do, know, and explore at level 60 in classic wow for a causal player.
---
Not being able to play the game also makes the world lose integrity.
---
Given the irony that removing it would actually make the game *feel* more vanilla, I'm certainly in support of removing it. I'm pretty far #nochanges, but keeping leeway is as silly as capping the framerate and putting everyone on dial-up connection again.
---
The whole point of this Classic project is to bring back the separation between casuals and hardcores. So yeah we casuals will always be undergeared but in the case of PvP you can compensate this gear difference by being a better player and a good teammate.
---
&gt;Because whatever is the pop you'll still have at least 1 rank 14 even if the server pop doesnt allow it.
---

So during Payment selection we will be able to select 1 from these 4 options?

Thank you!
---
Ah, yes, the Return Paladin.  Champion of the Bubblehearth.
---
They should pin this site to the top of the subreddit. Would get a lot more traction and attention.
---
Is WillWill the WoW version of MoonMoon ?
---
They've already made several changes to the game.
---
No changes is something they are listening to but actually making changes.
---
\#nochanges lost long ago, we should make the simple logical changes.
---
&gt; I only found out that all the cities had different AHs
---
They are linked and always were for as long as the released game had them.
---
The unlinked ones were only in the original beta testing.
---
No one cared who i was til i put on the mask
---
I am full time in law enforcement with no baggage like kids or a wife, so yeh it's possible  :) Not  saying those two are bad things, but I won't be dating this Winter.
---
They just have a very convincing feign death.
---
How much time do you think you can set aside for the game? At this point we're not reinventing the wheel, not having to learn the encounters from scratch/what works etc but more so implementing strategies that have been used for the past 12+ years. Guilds will be focusing more on efficiency rather than "brute force". In all honesty I can see guilds progressing comfortably by raiding 2-3 times a week with 2-3 hour sessions per raid.
---
I’m fine with that. I just don’t want to feel useless.  Even in TBC/ wrath I never had top arena gear but had a lot of fun. Just want to feel in the fight with the raiders.
---
Hi there dear hypocrite... please try not to be what you accuse others of being... entitled is someone expecting to be right and loudly barging in, usually someone who desires to denounce discussions in their own favor or telling others they need to learn to play the game....
---
my question is directed towards those playing the beta out of sheer curiosity and my questions had you read them are quite legit and based upon existing mechanics which i wonder if they are shared by paranoia or not and by how much stealth detect allows a player to percieve...
---
I'm agreeing with you...
---
In any case, just because some changes have occurred, that doesn't mean we shoudl just toss in the towel and give up with #nochanges. Yeah okay, we know Blizzard fucked up classic, but we can at least try to mitigate the extent of the fuck up.
---
No. The Europe subscription allows you to play on all the European realms: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, AND Russian realms.
---
It wouldn't TAKE LONGER.
---
If the active population isn't enough to sustain bracket 1 and all you can get it 12k per week you won't hit 60k ever.
---
Very detailed, thank you;) 
---
Rolling Lock?
---
Without going into any theorycrafting to determine which is better for levelling, i'd go with the following pros and cons:
---
Arms Pros: 
---
Deep Wounds / Impale (higher Crit damage en extra bleed damage on crit)
---
Improved Overpower (Crit % helps proc Deep Wounds)
---
Sweeping Strikes (short cooldown, allows killing 2 mobs at a time quickly, but does cost 30 rage to activate)
---
Mortal Strike (Instant attack which benefits more from high weapon damage)
---
Hamstring kiting at lower levels to reduce downtime (For solo play)
---
Multi-target attacks hit for more (Cleave/Whirlwind)
---
Arms Cons: 
---
Low base crit chance (you'll only get Cruelty talent at levels 41-45 and you'll need more agility on gear to make full use of Deep Wounds/Impale)
---
Stance switching required (Overpower and Sweeping Strikes are Battle Stance only abilities)
---
Lower rage generation over time compared to Dual-wield Fury (though slightly better than 2h Fury)
---
Miss/Parry streaks can slow you down anywhere between 6-12 seconds
---
Weapon Specializations mean you are either limited in weapon choices for maximum benefit, or have up to 5 talent points which are doing nothing when you're not using your chosen specialization (respeccing every time you get a new 2h is not worth the money at launch)
---
Doesn't get Enrage until levels 56-60 so not really relevant for levelling until the very end
---
Fury Pros:
---
Higher rage generation (Dual-wield only, 2h is about even with Arms)
---
More consistent dps, even with dual-wield miss chance factored in
---
Enrage (+25% damage increase, high uptime with duo-leveling due to pulling more mobs)
---
Flurry (Dual Wield eats up the 3 charges quickly, but you'll also trigger it more often)
---
Blood craze and Bloodthirst provide sustain and therefore lower downtime (Arms has to compensate with hamstring kiting, which is more reliable at lowering downtime, but both these factors aren't as important while duo-leveling)
---
Cleave deals slightly less damage per use, but costs less rage (since Cleave replaces your next white hit, and 2h generates more rage per hit than 1h. Damage difference overall is small because of Enrage)
---
No stance dancing needed, once you get berserker stance you can stay in that while grinding
---
Use Berserker Rage on cooldown for even more rage generation (generates extra rage when taking damage)
---
Not dependant on a specific weapon type. You can even skill up 2 difference 1h weapon skills if you want.
---
With the exception of weapons, not as gear dependant as Arms (Arms wants lots of Agi for crit, Dual-Wield fury does fine with any combination of Strength/Agi. Agi still recommended for more Flurry uptime)
---
Fury Cons:
---
Cleave and Whirlwind overall still deal less damage
---
No big bursts to twoshot mobs
---
No Tactical Mastery until level 46-50 (relevant only for PvP and to a lesser extent if you tank dungeons)
---
Need 2 decent weapons (Mitigated somewhat at 40+ due to the quest reward weapons i mentioned in my earlier post)
---
Death Wish has a 3 minute cooldown, and is not as readily available as Sweeping Strikes
---
Bloodthirst doesn't hit as hard as Mortal Strike
---
I'll edit the post if i think of more, but i need to leave for work now :P
---
From Blizzard themselves: "As we get closer to WoW Classic’s release, we thought now would be a good time to talk about our plans for Classic realms here in Europe.
---
We’ve prepared several realms, which will include Player vs Player, Player vs Environment, and Role-playing realms.
---
For Classic, we’re planning on not splitting up realms by language. This has its advantages and disadvantages, but overall, we think that it’s the best starting point for WoW Classic. An exception will be made for the Russian language, which will have separate realms due to its reliance on the Cyrillic Alphabet. **For technical reasons this will also mean Russian is going to have its own separate game client, similar to what happened in The Burning Crusade.**
---
We think this approach will give players more freedom to move around to where they want, and find guilds and friends that best match their interests."
---
I can devote a good chunk of time, probably around  15 hours per week or more but It’s the commitments to specific days and times that will likely hurt me for raiding really.
---
Here's a great druid guide https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
 \&gt; They recruited decently geared players with their mains and then logged onto their shitty alts, so they could get "free" boosts on their non-raiding days. 
---
It was most likely a prank.
---
Any guild of that caliber would have 0 problem gearing up alts.
---
If a former wow dev can't seem to understand the need for layering, then what hope it's there for the community to understand?
---
You could build a laptop that would have comparable or better specs than a macbook for gaming for half the cost. May not be name brand but will be decent enough to last a while and still get more oomph than a macbook.
---
Oh, I see what you mean
---
whew haven't subbed in a while, quit half way into bc.
---
a friend of mine got a warrior with nearly 400 days played at the end of bc.
---
Funny thing about this:
---
All paladin spells, including their retribution spells are "Holy School" spells ... so if you counterspell a paladin's holy light, you lock out seal of command and judgement, as well as Exorcism.
---
Interestingly however:
---
Turn Undead is considered a "Nature" spell, so even if a paladin is counterspelled, they can still turn undead to get that zombie mob off them.
---

Lets be real unless you're using a VPN (even then) your shit is being watched. Phone, home connection, doesn't really matter.
---
Kid, mc and onyxia will be down in maximum 5 days after launch. Black lotus hoarding is nothing.
---
If you’re horde be prepare to die :D
---
Warlock it is then ! Thanks for the insights :)
---
How is it not idea? I don't follow your confusion.
---
You sold me on the Warlock ! Thanks !
---
During WotLK I hit 3000 hours. That was the last expansion I played too.
---
Dude.. Spoilers..
---
Yes, those servers also won't have any of the hardcore players who rush to 60 to finish all the content. So the server community will be more lax. Hopefully they will release a RpPvP soon after launch. I don't think they will use layering for new servers after launch.
---
You know what's better marketing than views? Actually giving people a hands on demo. That's why we have open beta "tests" a couple of months before launch for most multi player games, yet we don't with classic. But that's a bit too complicated of a concept to get through to you apparently.
---
If what you say is true and advertising &gt; beta test, it would've been an open beta for everyone to experience the game like literally every other big multiplayer game does these days. Because people that watch streamers, specially game specific streamers are already a fan of the fucking game. The fact your tiny mind can't wrap it's head around such a simple concept is baffling. 
---
People that watch Soda, Asmongold, Venruki, Cdew and many of the other popular streamers playing classic are already fans of WoW and were likely going to play classic/retail anyway. The only streamers bringing in potential new players are variety streamers, and we barely have any of those streaming classic WoW at high numbers. So please, take your head out of your ass and think for a split second.
---
The fact that there are limited invites with a few streamers sprinkled on top, ***constant bug fixes and the fact they listen to feedback*** goes to show that testing is indeed a priority for them. Of course they'll want to market their game too, but to say marketing is the only priority here is absolutely idiotic. But I don't expect logic to go through your thick skull. So feel free to keep ignoring logic and living in your own little bubble.
---
I got mine just spam kill the miners not as many ally’s there
---
They've made changes, several of them. They never listened to the no changes crew but it's still something that's commonly said.
---
By far the biggest one is adding sharding/layering which is antithetical to the very reason people have sought classic wow for over a decade.
---
Actually, in general they've done a reasonably good job for most of it, but it's not up to spec with private servers quite yet. Hopefully they can figure it all out by release, but there's not much time left.
---
Thank you  very much for the informative post. I guess I'll have to make a stint as arms then. :(  
---
Really didn't want to but if it's universaly proven that fury is a torture early on, I'll do that.
---
Judgement on a 15 second cooldown made me sad. But having Reckoning, Divine Favor, and Seal of Command in the same build made me happy in the pants.
---
15k or dad server
---
I feel like I've been to active in world chat on SH, I've been spamming my macro for certain meat for days and people are using my technique now. Cupz
---
Its essential to a smooth launch though, the only alternatives are huge login queues or a ton of servers that will likely be ghost towns within a month or 2. 
---
I mean, by all means come up woth a solution that may be better or helpful, but shitting on it just because you dont like it, when it will most likely not be as big a deal as people like you make it out to be, helps no one and contributes nothing.
---
That is rather unusual. I've very rarely seen that to be the case
---
Oh God, I have to wait a few min?! Outrageous! Kids and even grown ups are so damn entitled today.
---
Spoken like someone who has no clue what login queues mean.
---
They mean **hours.** This happened when Vanilla originally was launched and it happens on every private server too. Furthermore, making enough servers for the game to be playable and not a public disaster that every news media source is going to be grilling, would mean ghost towns once the tourists leave.
---
If you're going to make a reply, at least know what you're talking about.
---
Smith smith?
---
You'll want slower weapons. A full reckoning is 5 attacks instantly and you want for those to hit as hard as possible. So, maximize weapon dmg. 
---
Malown's slam, Demonshear or Arcanite reaper are good entry weapons in phase 1. Best possible weapon in phase 1 would be bonereavers edge. For phase 2 Sulfuras, which remains the top choice until phase 5 (if sulfuras is not obtainable, Ashkandi or Grand marshal weapon are the best choices), Dark Edge of Insanity comes in phase 5 and in phase 6 corrupted ashbringer or might of menethil.
---
Yes, SoR generally for the dmg. A SoR reck bomb actually does quite similar dmg to a SoC reckbomb, as SoC can only proc once and SoR procs on each swing. But do put a judgement on the opponent before unleashing your reck bomb, either crusader for dmg or light/wisdom depending on whether you need mana or hp.
---
 Anyone that isnt complete idiot knows layering is terrible, especially the way it is implemented, and knowing blizzard it wont be any different. Because there is a portion of people that are fine with blizzard fucking them up the arse for years it doesnt change the absolute fact that layering will have huge impact in classic for both economy and the feeling of the game.
---
And classic was a success, how many can say the same about current wow? Go white knight somewhere else, sibce your obviously one of those entitled I want it all right away ppl.
---
they said no changes and then layering happened. /cue anger
---
Yes. It. Does. (to an extent). 
---
You won't be able to have 500 people in Northshire cause they will be split into layers.
---
Layer size is dynamic and can be adjusted in the first hours to let's say 500 people per layer. So unless the first 500 people all roll Human there is 0% chance that all 500 of them will be in Northshire.
---
The way I see it, layering solves a lot of problems and introduces only one. One that can still be fixed.
---
They will indeed, they had massivly oversized shoulders in the start of vanilla but they nerfed that. But yes they still do have the biggest shoulders ingame.
---
I;m coming back to make new friends and explore azeroth once again, all my friends from wow quit after wotlk and it was never the same.

You have no idea. Plenty of guilds sold slots, I raided in the best guild on Gorgonnash - US and we used to do GDKP runs every week because we wanted certain items from old raids but didn't need 95% of the loot so we sold it to shit players like yourself and the gold was split/guild leader paid for the entire raid nights repair bills.
---
Now go get cruel barb while you're at it ya goof!
---
They also said once they would never sell char boosts, faction changes etc etc, trusting them blindly is a mistake.
---
Ty
---
I want to play on a pvp server, can't have both on that server
---
Classic was **not** a success because of its launch issues.
---
You know what the worst thing about you is? That you'd never take responsibility for the public relations disaster that would happen if Blizzard launched an unplayable game. The news media grilling Blizzard for making a game where half the population had to sit in queues for hours would be **a good thing** for idiots like you.
---
You're the worst kind of commenter. The kind that is *anti-player.* Once again, you're comparing the launch of an MMO that was expected to flounder in 2004, with a launch of an already popular MMO in 2019.
---
You talk about having grown up opinions, but you still won't take responsibility for launching an unplayable game that people rightfully spent money to play.
---
Anti-consumer &amp; anti-player.
---
This. So much this.
---
One of the greatest experiences I ever had in Classic WoW ... was smelting Elementium to help make my friend's legendary sword...
---
[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] 
---
... It wasn't my legendary. And I knew I didn't have the raid attendance to ever deserve being given a legendary ... but it felt amazing to help, and participate in the fight to get it, after we farmed all the materials.
---
The giant race of our whole guild, rolling on their mounts, all the way out there to the middle of nowhere ... to face down a rare raid boss, to get this sword.
---
The thing is? For so many people to work so hard, to get one item for one person ... shows a lot of trust. A lot of love. A lot of cooperation.
---
You don't give a legendary to someone you don't trust. Ever.
---
Dont Pick a class based on how easy it is to lvl.
---
Leveling is a fun part of vanilla, but also a very minor part. Think forward the next two years, what do you wanna do in raids, world pvp, or whatever floats your boat.
---
An example could be you want to play priest! Because you just fucking love that!
---
So don’t be like, yeah I might as well make an NELF, because I’m
---
on a pvp realm. Yeah use those extra 1 minute x deaths to run back to your corpse. You will appreciate that when they invite you to join the clan instead of the NELF! You know why?!
---
Because you got a fucking fear ward motherfucker
---
Same with the Benediction here. Its my goal in Classic to get it.
---
You never had a point to begin with.
---
Your premise that Classic was popular in 2004 because it had login queues is pants-on-head stupid; does not logically follow; and flies against the evidence.
---
There's no argument to argue here. Just you taking insane L's over and over ;)
---
That's about 30% of the total time passed since vanilla was released then, not very realistic :P
---
I've tried all types of diets and I have to tell you that first of all you have to choose a diet that could become your lifestyle for a very long time - it is not something that you do just for a while or you easily gain the weight back. Now there are different types of fasting but the idea is that you have long periods without consuming food. You could try not to eat a few days a week, like only drinking water on Tuesday and Thursday. Another variation is to have only a 6 hour window per day to consume food and then only water for the rest 18 hours. If you haven't fasted until now you can start with 8 hour eating window during the day and 16 hours fasting and after a few weeks try to lower the hours that you can eat per day. Also you need to gradually lower the calories that you consume per day and eat smaller portions but more often. If your stomach is always full it is harder for you to adapt to a longer periods without food. During fasting I recommend you to have a few cups of green or other tea (without honey or sugar added to it, you can add a a slice of lemon for a better taste) as it helps you not to feel hungry for a while. Additionally you need to cut all sugar foods and drinks because they are a drug for your mind, after a week you will start craving them like a drug maniac but you have to have the will to resist and it will past. You can keep eating a few slices of bread per day if it is hard for you but no chocolate, deserts, pizza, fast food or anything else related. Now I have to warn you that the first two to three weeks will be very hard for you and you might not lose any weight, even gain some. But you have to remember that you are playing the longer game and you need to change your lifestyle. When you change your eating habits your body feels huge amount of stress. Up to now it was programmed to store huge amount of calories and now suddenly it has to burn them and it panics for a while if everything is ok with you. For a few days you might have a diarrhea and feel that you don't have much motivation to do anything but if you hold for a few days it will pass and you will feel much better and have much more energy. I've been extremely overweight and I have experienced this a few times when I decide to diet. Also most people give up at this point which is really bad. After a month on fasting I would suggest to start hitting the gym or doing more outdoor activities so you can speed up your metabolism. Also if you have any health issues don't start fasting on your own and consult with a doctor.

As others have said a full time feral tank is a great addition to any raid tanking roster, primarily as an OT, but situations(though comparatively few) do arise where a druid can be considered a preferable MT due to mechanics or as kill times increase etc. 
---
The lower feral AP scaling noted on Beta (if it does in fact eventuate at 60) will in fact be only a minor nerf to what makes bears strong, and certainly not enough to change their viability in this regard. 
---
Anyone who trots out the old "druids can only heal at endgame" at this point is being wilfully ignorant.
---
Now you are just ignorant, does not surprise me coming from someone who defends a flawed system only for personal gain :)
---
making gold is a part of the game though
---
Oh boy. This again?
---
Melee leeway is NEEDED to make sure they have a chance to fight being kited. If the person trying to control the melee opponent is any good, he can still do it. It's a mechanic that makes it you cannot play with half a hand and still easily win.
---
What is your main? Hunter? Mage? Warlock? Shadow Priest?  
---
In either of those options you are very well equipped to deal with melee.
---
Nothing but a campaign to nerf melee classes that really really do not need to be nerfed.
---
I'll play the other faction only when my server is down or my character is unavailable (getting camped or waiting for friend who is on same quest). I play alliance but I love Taurens and Shamans and it gives me a chance to see the other side. That is, up till level 30 when basically all quests are copies of each other..
---
Agree, tried it a few weeks ago and you simply can‘t get enough greens/cloth. Skipping them is way faster theb farming and using them
---
None of those are valid points. 
---
Try again?
---
I'm excited about this tbh. Aggro worked in a totally different way back in vanilla. Back then, it was easy to see if you were in a dungeon/raid with a good tank - meaning someone who could keep aggro on all mobs while mitigating damage, and often lead the group - and a crappy tank who would just clueless spam sunder armor on one target and have the healer tank the rest due to healing aggro. 
---
It probably doesn't come as a surprise, but I played a warrior back then and I did my best to be the best possible tank I could learning rotations, how to aoe tank, how to mitigate damage, how to help the healer etc. And as you say, in the later expansions all of these crappy tanks who had no idea how to keep aggro got a free pass as basically (keeping it in my warior terminology here) the tank just had to charge in and do a single thunder clap and he would have infinite aggro on all mobs.  Such a lame and lazy way by Blizzard to make sure bad players were able to tank aswell instead of letting people evolve and become better at the game. 
---
Anyways, as much as I know most dungeons are going to be hell tanking due to the fact that people think vanilla is just another aoe/cleave faceroll through everything, I'm excited that it's going to take skills to be tanking once again.
---
To be fair, as an Alliance that always pvp’d before this expansion, sharding just increased my problem. For the first time ever, I just had to turn off warmode 4 months into BFA.
---
I like PvP, it’s my favorite aspect of WoW, but I’m not here for the 2v20s in my own towns, and then when I just pack up and leave, I run phase into a raid guarding a dungeon. Or when I was a part of a massive battle where the Alliance won, I crossed a brigde, and I phased alone into a Horde raid guarding that escort world quest. Being consistantly out numbered 12 to 1 is no fun for me, and I assume no/less fun for the Horde.
---
I don’t know what the solution to this is, but warmode and sharding only exaggerated an already huge imbalance I was facing before.
---
DM farming should be more popular.  
---
This will cause some gold inflation.  
---
It is believed that the continued playerbase will be proportionally more dedicated than they were in 2006.  
---
This will cause some more gold inflation.  
---
The biggest change is that people can anticipate certain mats being more popular in later phases, which will lead to speculation on those materials earlier on.  
---
Apart from that, people knowing where to farm mats won't impact economy much comparatively, as all the higher stuff was pretty optimized on the more populated servers in vanilla anyway.
---
They are full of bullshit, as always. They have been feeding us this shit for years, yet from time to time we were able to play with russian client on european servers without issues. Not to mention there are people playing beta with russian client right now without any issues.
---
This time it will be the same as it is currently on retail - in order to play on russian client your client locale will need to be ruRU, you won't be able to play with any other and you won't be able to play with ruRU on other realms.
---
Yeah, managing 40 people of likely different races and nationality is a challenge. Those that did it well really benefitted from the experience. I mean, I had good raid leaders use this experience in their interviews and actually got the job
---
You should charge/zerk macro in pvp so you arrive at a fear cc target in zerk stance. Pservers allowed the charge rage delay to gain after you ‘connect’ with charge to gain rage. So if you macro the charge you’d arrive in berserker with your charge rage. I doubt the classic client would have that feature but macroing is the best bet.
---
That's not how testing works. More invites = more reports doesn't always correlate to more productivity. Open beta is almost never done for testing purposes other than stressing the servers. Open betas are glorified demos used to market the game. Classic will likely have an open beta the last few weeks for that very reason. You say I don't understand how marketing works, but every single point you made in that post very clearly indicates you have no clue how marketing and testing works. Just because you invite more people, doesn't mean more shit gets tested. Sorting through 1000 reports of the exact same bug doesn't make fixing it any faster, it just slows them down when they're getting spammed with repeated reports of the same bug. Do you really think you know better as to how many testers are needed than the people actually making the game? Give me a fucking break.
---
I clearly said variety streamers were invited for marketing in my previous post, the beta consists of 5000 or so invites, pokimane getting an invite doesn't mean there is less testing. Never once did I say there is no marketing going on here, I'm just calling out your blatant circle jerking that insinuates this beta's sole purpose is marketing. That claim is utter bullshit, and if you fail to see that, then well your head is so far up your ass there is no point in even trying to explain simple concepts to you.
---
I have no idea if that can happen, but on a PvE server it could.
---
I fear he is right but that's a few years away. I believe that blizzard will stay the course and implement no changes.... until Naxx releases. After that, this game will be changed. Will they release new original content? Will they implement the voting system that runescape has and let the community decide on new features? Or will they monetize it worst then EA does with FIFA? If I was a betting man, I'd say the latter... but, you get 1-2 solid years!
---
Yeah I've been playing warlock since Nost, though I'm trying out priest on ND right now just for a change. I really like how the warlock have so many hurdles to overcome, but when you finally master them, it's so rewarding. It's also an amazingly complex class, people have spent hundreds or even thousands of hours on theorycrafting the lock even 12 years after TBC ended vanilla. There are still massive debates on discords and other communities about how to play a warlock. Which is why videos made my content producers are generally not that helpful, they do their best to digest what the warlock community presents, but that is not an easy task and it changes quickly.
---
You are as young as you feel, not alone that but well its the web... gender/age/skin/country... doesnt exactly matter unless you make it matter or act in a manner that reflects those things...
---
I would not mind playing a game alongside a 80 year old or 12 year old as long as they act in a mature manner without reflecting on age inside the game by throwing a tantrum or telling a tale of good old days irl..
---
gender is also easily faked online with voice emulator it can be rather fun going incognito or just for fun take a different voice.
---
Classic is a social game, only thing that seperates players in this would be raiding times and amount of time ready to spare for the game.
---
&gt; you no longer get layered, you move onto the main server
---
Ah, so once you hit 20, you can't level with your level 18 pal until he, too, hits 20.
---
Got it. Sounds great.
---
Don't have it sorry.
---
They hired a new gear artist I guess.
---
My old skool vanilla rogue had 279 days... I missed the tbc expansion but played every other. I am affraid to look whats on my other chars....
---
I think im going skinning/leatherworking on my lock for the first levels, just to get enough mats to do the wands. My bank will then do the ench, and I can always switch professions later. Going orc so will have lots of creatures to skin in the first couple of levels (and Ninja skin when others dont have skinning).
---
&gt; Because different realms doesn't share databases and there's possible merge conflicts when people have the same character names, guild names etc.
---
No, there's not. I addressed this, as retail already handles this. If there is a Pimdaz on ED and a Pimdaz on Venture Co and the 2 get merged, they would show in guild as Pimdaz-EmeraldDream and Pimdaz-VentureCo.
---
So you are not going to say what classes you play? I think it's kind of relevant.
---
Have you ever played a warrior and fought versus a frost mage or a hunter with chain traps, improved wing clip and shit like that?
---
That new Judgement was awesome.  Dragonstalker should've gotten the old Judgement look instead of their new look.
---
Well I couldn't think of another race, but it'd just be cool if there was engineering stuff only for horde and only for alliance to make faction choice more important.
---
Then layering stays. That's what worries me.
---
What does that even mean. “They look classic as fuck” are the new renditions that were also out during classic not classic too? Like what.
---
Yes
---
hunters could trap while simultaneously kiting another, frost mage was also particularly good at this as well, had a good frost mage with me and we made shattered halls about 10x easier that way.
---
You're right, it'll be worse. I can't wait.
---
I've always played Tank classes and I will say tank away.  Classic Warrior tanking was a blast.
---
For raiding you'll need to play way more then 30 min and the same goes for most late game dungeons.   If you are going to flag carry and do PVP as a tank then you should be fine with minimal game time.
---
They're very much viable tanks. They excel at gaining threat faster than warriors, which let's your DPS go nuts and down bosses faster. They're very versatile and some builds can even allow you to heal decently, on the fights that you don't tank.
---
You can MT almost all content, there are just a few fights that are a bit dodgy for bears. I would say the one "con" is that their kit is a bit simple, not as complex/engaging as a warrior.
---
Please ignore the naysayers! Skarm (on YouTube) has cleared Naxx with both warrior and druid. He loves druid and his videos can give you a lot of good info.
---
As someone who had the tier sets before the graphical update, I disagree. They were way too bland. Do you want Thunderfury to  just be a normal longsword too?
---
My IRL mate is actually the dev behind ConsolePort! Check it out on curse. He is currently tailoring the addon for classic launch. Also, more key binds are in the works and I must say what he is implementing seems really smooth to use. According to him, a PS4 controller is optimal. 
---
Best of luck!
---
Manager is concerned as in august 27th hald of team got sick and other halfs grandma died
---
These auto-battlers are crazy addicting.  Personally I prefer TFT but which ever you choose they're all fun.
---
A few thoughts:
---
* If you start at server launch, the level 5 crafted wands will not be at the AH until you are level 15 for the smoldering wand.
---
* Imp is good for 15-35 once you get wands. Voidwalker is still good for 10-15 until you get a wand. Voidwalker is better on the beta now in terms of holding aggro, but killspeed is still much faster with imp and speccing into improved imp. 35 plus and tight rooms are where the voidwalker shine though.
---
* Spec into improved imp after corruption 5/5. See point above. progress into Fell Stamina 5/5 and improved Voidwalker until you are 35-40.
---
* Siphon Life isn't worth buying, not even for Nightfall. It does cost too much mana and doesn't return enough health.
---
* For Imp, only buy Firebolt, Blood Pact and 1 rank of Phase Shift. Fire Shield isn't worth it.
---
* Once you start using your Voidwalker regularly, buy all the availble skills and keep them updated.
---
* Improved Drain Soul isn't worth it because you only get the mana reg if the Drain Soul damage kills the target (which NEVER happens). Better spec into suppression (3/5) to get to hit cap.
---
Otherwise it's a good summary!
---
You sigh at #####.
---
hella fun and rewarding. I probably did it twice in the 1 year i played TBC.
---
You are a hunter from taking a glance on your previous posts. During leveling with beast mastery your pet will destroy melee easily. Why are you worried about melee leeway? On max level competitive duels or what?
---
AV isn't just a viable means of grinding out your rank it is by a some margin the best means.
---
The only dependent is if your server knows this. The way AV is designed the result is both factions literally ignore each other and both rush all the bonus honor. It doesn't even matter if you loss the match unlike AB and WSG because you will still get 90%+ of the objectives even on a loss.
---
You're taking about your comment I assume?
---
i don't have a second monitor, but i would love something like this for warrior and mage.
---
no, no.
---
Playing 10 hours in total, or playing 10 hours in raids?
---
Yeah, totally a corporate bootlicker. Good comeback little fella. Don't let logic and facts get in the way of that.
---
since pick pocketing costs nothing, everything you pick pocket is profitable
---
Go home r/Warhammer , you’re drunk.
---
Then you’ll have to deal with ppl geared better than you, sometimes probably 2 shoting you, depends on what class you wanna play. You will be a casual, casuals are not competetive by any means. You won’t be irrelevant, don’t get me wrong. It’s just you won’t be competetive, any semi-hardcore guy raiding twice a week will be better than you in what you do. If you wanna play casualy don’t think about being competetive cuz you will hit a wall sooner or later. I would also recommand rolling something less gear dependant, warrior/rogue are definitly NOT something i would recommand going for.
---
In Valhalla.
---
\*picks up sheild\*
---
\*crowd cheering\*
---
That assumes the population of participants is 333 or less. Which is insane. It also assumes it stays that way **forever** which is also insane.
---
The original sets were placeholder armors because Blizzard didn't have time to put them in the game before launch.
---
My rogue (vanilla and tbc main, wotlk alt) 8000 hours.  Exalted with every BC reputation, got winterspring frostsaber in Vanilla, etc
---
My warrior (Vanilla and tbc alt, wotlk PvP casual main, legion main) 2500 hours of pure PvP goodness.  Briefly rolled prot in tbc and got badge gear for funsies
---
Druid (legion alt) 200 hours, pure PvP healer
---
Other Alts, about 500 hours combined.
---
that was T2 before BWL release, right? because i'm pretty sure i had T2 while raiding BWL, before AQ release!
---
So spirit is useless for regular people. You will not even notice the difference in your regular gameplay.
---
no, because of crossrealm BG's. Lower pop realms used to have less frequent pops, with cross realm BG's queus will pop all day.
---
The liklihood as I said is bordering on the impossible. The idea that less than 333 people on a server per faction will get 15HKs is incredibly unlikely.
---
Maybe lmaooo
---
i hated TBC, continued to play after, but was very Unhappy about all the changes, until i could not take it anymore in wotlk.
---
i am so happy MY best version of wow comes back =)
---
No you can not.
---
Weren't the old ones just considered as place-holders?
---
This is very cool, I’m going to make one for priest.
---
All you know you must carry 2 of them.
---
&gt; We no longer have cancer so why are we still taking the dangerous therapy?
---
\#nochanges
---
I said from the start that this attitude will not end well, but that's what we have now.
---
&gt; Chromatically tempered went for 3-4k alone
---
That seems extreme. 3k gold was a LOT of money in vanilla.
---
Which is bad because the CIA wants you to feed information to them via good old USA made products?
---
I think Druid OTs are great!  We are running one in  my guild.
---
It's just the WoW reddit community. Most average people seem to agree with us.
---
I don't remember, but when I resub after my 9 year boycott, I'll let you know.
---
Death Coil is mildlyinfuriating
---
I hope you know what to look for. I laugh at people who spent $1500 - 2500 on a piece of junk..
---
Than you are good to go, just pug MC/ONY maybe BWL on evening you are free. Get some decent gear, and when AQ hits maybe look for a guild where you could sit on a bench. Every guild needs a bench, and every guild will take benched guys for raids from time to time anyway to keep them at least a lil bit geared. With 15h a week you are perfectly fine I think, don’t worry too much
---
Edited: They hired a -new- gear artist I guess.
---
people look at me funny when carrying my nitro in my front pocket thou :(

It's going to be a faithful recreation of the way Vanilla WoW was. The Classic WoW team are working hard on giving us an authentic Vanilla experience. You really can't judge the product they're producing until it releases. Your friend's opinion of Blizzard has no effect on how things will actually be
---
Nah dawg he’s just living in 04’ atm.
---
MC attunement consists of being lvl 55 and running BRD till after the council of seven. Every fresh 60 should have that.
---
BWL attunement consists of killing a mob in front of the instance and then press an orb at Drakkisath, also quite easy.
---
ZG and AQ have no attunement and for Naxx it'S jsut getting rep with argent dawn and paying something.
---
Only the ONyxia attunement is a very long questline in vanilla and I doubt raiders would help people to do that, jsut so they could potentially pay in onyxia runs.
---
I quit about 1 week into BC. IRL stuff became more important
---
I am going to play with 10-12 guys who also played vanilla but stopped several expansions ago. 
---
I'm most excited about a a fresh server start on official servers
---
It's gonna be so fun!
---
as long as it takes you to farm 500 stacks of runecloth (assuming you start at 0/3000 friendly)
---
10.000 runecloth
---
30% drop rate of 1-3runecloth average of 22.000 none elite lvl 60 humanoids. witch isnt so bad if you think about it. lets do some other math
---
if a avg mob dropes only 1silver you be up to 220g after that grind. if it is 10s or even 50s with grey/green/blue dropes you are up to 2200g or even 11.000g
---
if a boe world epic has a droprate of 0,01% you would at least find 2
---
you can also combine it with leveling 50-60 and rep grinding. timbermaw rep &amp; winterspring firewater, argent dawn and/or cenarion circle.
---
now the sads part. if you are a fast killing class and average around 15sec per kill (10globalcooldowns, 5x3sec casts etc..) you need a wooping 330.000sec or 5.500min or 91h or about 4days played. lets factor in regtime after 5mobs another 30sec ~ 132.000 sec. that bumps it up to 128h or 5,3days played.
---
if 50-60 takes you about 48h and you start grinding you be a little under half that time when dingin 60 so another 3,3days left.
---
if you get your rep up with quests to only need 250stacks you would have your epic cross race mount almost at the same time you ding 60
---
Can you make one for mage also? I love this you did!
---
The bad news about getting older is that life moves by faster. The good news is that things you're looking forward to come more quickly.
---
Holy/Ret is a prime ass PvP build. Just watched a YouTube video of a guy taking a warrior and hunter on at the same time... ate them up.
---
He calls it the “Holidan” build. He never has to respec for raids either.
---
I feel like this is an add for the hardware. These things are expensive and shoddy af from a 10 min search
---
mind you Naxx was already out, and gold was inflationed a lot. Those weapons were on par with rank14
---
Check out laptops powered by Nvidia MX150 graphics (and MX250 which was just released and is nearly identical in performance - there aren't many laptops with this chip yet).
---
It's a dedicated graphics card similar to a GeForce GT 1030, which will run plenty of games at an acceptable framerate at 1080p on medium-ish settings.
---
I've about 30k hours in WoW, 5k in Dota 2, 1k in Path of Exile, 1k in World of Tanks, 1k in CS:GO.
---
You think locks go oom with lifetap, pots and runes ?
---
Making mine tailor/leatherworking.  
---
I was impressed wit how many early recipes really pump u the vendor value of the lather I'll be skinning on my main. Sometimes as much as doubling the vendor value of every single piece of leather (-mailing fees of 4.16 copper per stack, if it's 12 items per).
---
I don't assume anything.
---
There is no guarantee that the PvPing population will be enough to sustain rank14s.
---
Yea planning ahead is so cringey.....and pathetic.....yolo swag right?

Most of my WoW time I spend on my bloodelf Paladin "Reyzero" (EU) that was created after I came back from a modded private Server to TBC. Leveled him to about 50 (39 with Shadowblad+mongoose x3), then WotLk prepatch came in. Holy moly, addiction got real. Played that char until midway Cata, made a break, joined midway MoP to midway WoD, came back a bit for Legion. Character has about 600 days alone.
---
My whole retail acount has about 900 days in total ... sadly not including my characters from back in classic/TBC and one char from Cata. Prolly another good 200 days in. So at the very least 1.000 days just from retail wow.
---
I played multiple private Servers, custom ones, Classic, TBC, WotLk. All not really Long until I raided on one TBC Server for a good year, again main char about 150 days. All other chars aswell? Prolly nearly 300. Now im playing on another private Server until classic ... again on 100 days.
---
So yeh im more than above 1.5k hours.
---
Since Arma 2 DayZ didnt got Count in steam (prolly a few thousand hours ...), ARK is my highest played with about 1.5k hours. Got the same amount in WoW as D A Y S.

I’ll rephrase, shadowbolt until your 1 key breaks off

It would only add to faction imbalance.

Did he say "RL money"?  
---
Gold is in game money.
---
Really neat! Good job.
---
Sounds like LFR with extra steps
---
You make me wanna play lock, even tho thats what I played in Vanilla and I was thinking to go Priest.
---
I might want to have 2 accounts since alot of my friends are going alliance, and alot of my friends are going horde. But we will see, ill start with the alliance one
---
Did a BFD run back on un-official servers where we had 4 warriors and 1 priest. 
---
Most fun run of our lives due to the cc limit. We where all playing tauren and The extra stun went a long way. 
---
The room with the brazier was crazy fun to handle, raid level of cordination with cc best we could, rotating tauren racial etc. 
---
Highly recommend the 4 warrior combo, makes dungeons while levling a whole new type of challeng.
---
Sure, and there's no guarantee it won't be and that it will stay that way always. So it assumes those two things.
---
Also, we should both be clear of how unlikely it is that less that 333 or less people will participate, while there's no guarantee there's also no guarantee getting struck by lightning irl will stop your ranking.
---
&gt;Also am I the only 1 who won't be playing classic hunter if they don't fix all these major issues. I've wanted my hunter for 10 years now and these issues are making me quite mad irl.
---
Actually author indeed is a hunter that constantly talks about leeway.
---
2hr +  (memespecs x 1 hr)
---
Well since you put up such a convincing argument...
---
I have a hard time to understand the concerns you have. You just come and claim this is 'broken', because latency is 'no longer a problem today'. With several thousand players on a single server, so latency is of course still relevant. It's an MMO and not an FPS with 16 players per server. Your ping may be low, but between trying to fire your ability and the server processing thousands of things at once...
---
What are you basing your claim that latency today is not an issue in a thousand player MMO?
---
Really, that was in 1.9? I could have sworn it was in 1.7 or something. I had full t2 before 1.9 and I can't even remember the old look.
---
Happened a lot. My guild would sell specific items for MC/BWL, inviting the buyer at the beginning of the boss dropping it. Fees depended of the item.
---
No.
---
Stay excited. So far it seems the devs aren't being guided by a corporate hand. So it doesn't mean that actiblizz has changed its ways. It just means that the devs aren't being supervised.
---
Corporate already made it clear that they don't consider classic a major release. So they don't expect profits.
---
Now we just have to hope that it makes enough profits to also remake tbc and wrath. But not so much that corporate gets interested
---
&gt;  So it assumes those two things.
---
I don't assume ANYTHING.
---
I'm just stating that IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
---
wait there are non pvp servers?
---
Obvious troll kid...
---
Not in classic. In vanilla, the only enchanting artisan trainer is the lady in uldaman.
---
Was shaman in Vanilla but Warlock have been my main since TBC - BFA. 
---
Just hated the SB spamming meta in later TBC. It was so boring to raid that way but Damn effective :) 
---
SB spam seems to be the go-to in vanilla as well and that is so boring imo. Warlocks gave so many cool abilities and dots and not being able to utilise that would be a damn shame :)
---
Yeah Straight up hetero.

unlike those alliance sissy bois.... :D

Competitive and casual in same sentence?
---
Don't want to be rude, but its either one or the other.
---
You can't be competitive as a casual. It's just impossible.
---
i got that reference.. take my upvote
---
The blacksmith ones does though and people rate that for PvP.
---
I agree and well I hope we don't if I had a choice.
---
I think LFM means looking for more, rather than looking for mate.
---
Small note: BFD wand is available at 18 (if you can get a group to carry you, otherwise groups are usually 20+), it's ridiculously OP and lasts until 30+.
---
You want Warcraft 3 I think. I would say that lore is the core lore for much of the base.
---
Obviously it covers wrath of you get frozen throne.
---
Can we transfer Characters from PvE to PvP freely after levelling to max level?
---
Define "decent", what is your ultimate goal? Id you cant commit to raid Times due to time constraint then you can very likley go OT as a fury warrior and dps when They have others joining in for the tank jobb
---
Biggest cons that I remember from vanilla.
---
1.  No fear break.
---
2.  Taunt misses.  Warriors get a set bonus to help.
---
3.  Lack of cooldowns.
---
4. No interrupt.
---
5.  Spiky damage taken.  Due to crushing blows
---
6.  Utility is useless in most mt situations.   I mean, you can time a midnight battle rez or innervate as the MT, but if you fail, it's a wipe.
---
Pros.
---
1.  Good threat.
---
2.  Highest health pool in game.
---
3.  Highest armor mitigation in game.
---
4.  Utility.
---
5.  Faster to gear up.
---
I tanked almost every fight back in the day, even on progression.
---
Nelf top kek
---
The only one you got right was LFM 
---
Looking for Mate.... LFM
---
Looking for Girlfriend.... LFG
---
Want to Snuggle.... WTS 
---
Want to Bang.... WTB
---
Your aren’t keen for [multiple] worlds of warcraft?
---
This guy is not Australian so he does not looking for mates
---
There will be only one piece of T2 you can get in MC and thats the legs from Ragnaros. I´m pretty sure it will be like this.
---
Onyxia T2 Head and the rest from BWL.
---
Sure, I suggest you join the classic wow discord (link in sidebar) and go to the looking for guild channel (don't know the exact name).
---
You might find someone there.
---
There will be weekly MC pugs and near daily ZG pugs later in the cycle. Unless you play a gear independent class you're going to get crushed in PvP
---
I don´t know, i rly like the old Warrior T2. 8-)
---
blizzard's bullshit eu/na separation is so annoying.. not so much in wow but games like Diablo with separate progress and 2 friends lists is a joke. I'm glad Destiny is moving to steam where we can have a unified friends list.
---
Do you guys think people will still twink? With BGs not our for a while after release they probably won’t be able to catch as many people off guard aka it could be more of twink premades
---
Most of the time I used to just carry the ones I found in the world.
---
I only used them in emergencies or whenever I have too many. 
---
If you have these lowest lvl pots, and can't sell them on AH, they can be a QoL in between mob pulls in a dungeon or something.
---
They already confirmed that there will only be the new looks.
---
Jesus Christ this sub.
---
The one that it took me ages to understand in trade chat is an older one thats not THAT common anymore, but common enough that you probably want to know what it is.
---
PST = Please Send Tell

A "tell" is older MMO speak for a whisper / direct message

Nice! Even though I know most of those it was still fun reading.

Your right - thats what sharding is for.

2nd attempt of upload thanks to reddit UI =\_=. This is my first video ever , I managed to add some music with w10 inbuilt editor but couldn't find the option to add dramatic zooms on backpedaling and out of range spams. Also I almost killed the thrash mob at the wrong time

Dopest player alive right there

I wonder if it's just the memory tricking so many of us or if the patchnotes are just wrong...

They were definitely pre bwl - I had some pieces of transcendence and don't remember them looking like the first set.

To add on to this, what about stuff like General Chat.  Or custom chats like world chat.

you still got the 60% mounts that aren't armored

Trying. Getting her a notebook would be the smallest problem...but getting her to do it... She is a "maybe later" type.

Is there a way to macro misdirect to apply to 
---
1. current target
---
2. focus target
---
3. pet
---
in that order? If applicable, misdirect to current selected player. If not and if there's a focus target (generally: the tank) misdirect to her. If no friendly player is selected and no focus target is selected, cast on the pet.
---
Ah tauren priests, you don't see enough of them.
---
Good threat. On private servers, yes. In Classic their threat will be on par or bellow Prot Warriors.
---
Highest HP pool. Irrelevant. What matters is EHP, and Warriors have almost twice EHP compared to equally geared Druids.
---
Highest armor mitigation. Only in Phase 1. BWL geared Warriors have almost the same armor mitigation as druids.
---
Utility. Yes...if they do NOT tank. If they tank, they have no utility.
---
Faster to gear up. Yes, but that gear simply sux balls until AQ40. And after AQ40, Warriors will still have better gear for tanking. Gearing up fast with crap gear is irrelevant.
---
I'm an oceanic player and will be forced to play on the American servers, either all the time or during battlegrounds. For some of us, 250ms latency is all we can achieve. Melee leeway helps us out a lot.
---
Definitely a fucking hunter
---
They will have aussie realms.
---
Because they don't know how many players will there be on each server, and for how long
---
I have still lot's of fun in Heroes of the Storm. Playing my guys Falstad, Kael'Thas, Jaina, Thrall, Chromie... already brings me in the right mood :)
---
12 am is midnight. Pm is midday.
---
Think of it as in the a doesn't go together. Am, middAy.
---
If you don't know about WOW, please try WOW before entering WOW Classic. If you are not sure which career you like, start with Hunter. This career is very strong and easy to operate. Once you have a basic understanding of the game, you can consider other professions.
---
mages aren't exactly suffering
---
&gt; Warriors are better tank all around except AOE aggro. 
---
Actually, Warriors have the best AoE aggro in Classic among all tanks.
---
You should knew that by now.
---
Druid warlock and may be rogue are the only ones that look better.
---
You are assuming layer hopping is a bannable offense.
---
They might have some, but even on retail we are put in battlegrounds with Americans and the server always defaults to NA. Arguably the most critical time to have low latency is during pvp.
---
There won't be combined battle groups so there won't be different pvp ping.
---
No, the question is not already answered. 
---
We have incomplete information, we don't know what other changes exist at endgame vs private servers.
---
To bad the  "Riding Crop" is not in Classic. Miss to use that good item :)
---
Can you guys tell me what is 5-8?
---
How can you be so sure? It's been done like that since 2014.
---
Come on, you know I was referring to the "battle of survival" kind of bosses. Besides most people got geared up in Karazhan and Gruul's Lair first. Unfortunately it's true, I don't have much memories about the pre-nerfed heroics.
---
How can you not be sure when it wasn't in the game?
---
Holy paladins would like a word with you.
---
Just ignore /u/eveclassic is an obvious troll.
---
Why are they doing this? What of players who spent a lot of time getting max gear who had to emigrate from EU to US?
---
Yupp
---
Recently watched a tutorial for 5-man grinding where 1 priest 4 warriors is the best combo. Heard dps and cleave was insane!

&gt;New Tier2 Epic Armor Models
---
if you plan on keeping up gathering professions such as herbalism or mining during leveling you will eventually have to choose between progressing forward for xp or stay in a zone to level your gathering profession.
---
from my own experience i know that i always prioritize leveling because the most important goal is to reach max level.
---
Once level 60 i dedicate an evening or two to max my gathering profession of choice and put whatever main profession (enchanting, tailoring or w/e) is put on a more of a long term schedule.
---
Its more important to get prebis items from dungeons and farming for the epic mount. (altough a maxed proffesion surely would help with the gold farm when it comes to transmutes or other rare recipes ofc)
---
basically this is what works best for me:
---
lvl 60 &gt; 1 gathering profession &gt; prebis items &gt; epic mount=&gt; crafting profession
---
Bc heroics were harder than some Kara bosses. Wasn't uncommon to do Kara before heroics!
---
Cata heroics were kinda hard, but once you started getting gear from bwd and bot they got pretty easy.
---
Yeah spamming one button is generally what you do as a caster in vanilla. Melee use more buttons but if you really want an advanced rotation with lots of abilities then you're looking at warrior tanking. They have their threat rotation, defensive rotation, rage dump abilities on top of positioning and taking care of 90% of all raid mechanics in vanilla.
---
I don't see the problem. As if this is better in retail.
---
What dozen? There's PvP or PvE
---
Can someone make a priest levelling one? Cheers xx
---
E=mc^2
---
Fair enough
---
It'll be like, Feburary of next year till I hit 60 lol
---
I quit many years ago, but played vanilla from launch until WOTLK.
---
Getting back on with all of my friends who played vanilla back in the day, so thats pretty cool.
---
Yeah could also mean that.
---
I think it has more to do with copyright rules. Better to fight private servers when you have your own version as well.
---
So the mods actually have a sense of humour on this sub or is this a freak event.
---
hehehehehehe
---
Most people who are interested in WOW Classic have already worked, and will not have much time to enter WOW Classic as before.
---
Yeah i guess, I tried a few times and ended up oom or dead. I just wanted to record the successful try so I could give a shot at video editing and feed this subreddit with some content
---
I'm honestly afraid of those people, who think they are better, because they played earlier than I did. Or said otherwise, I am already tired of discussions who played when and is "way more experienced".
---
holy jezuz your bad
---
True , still wouldnt retail be claimed under their IP anyway since WoW isnt abandonware? Does it matter which patch the game runs?
---
then wrath came and we were aoe farming heroics in token gear
---
Sure. Especially if you travel around to do every quest to limit grinding. However you will have to do some level of grinding in the process of getting to 60, and you can see easily choose to grind mobs that drop the cloth you need instead of something else. It's really not as much of a loss as you might think. Now, when you get to 60, your skill will still probably be in the 230-250 range at most without purchasing cloth on the AH.
---
The other thing is that if you buy cloth on weekends on the AH, make a crap ton of bags, and sell them during the following week, you usually can turn a profit anyway, which helps with the skillups. 
---
Ultimately your point is correct, but I think you can easily limit the downside with a small amount of planning.
---
Had totally forgotten about this.
---
what if they artificially add lag to satisify the vanilla experience?
---
I would say that you can comfortably even pug everything except naxx maybe and for AQ the pug group would have some requirements for sure. But I would say if you are casual who is able to go through Molten core, you would get through BWL easily too
---
Oh, okay, didn't know. Most likely because that was after I quit.
---
Depends on spec. Moonkins and Cat ferals definitely have mana issues.
---
I am glad Judgement was changed. It has to be one of the best looking sets to date for any class.
---
Yeah, but we're hunters. If we wanna pull, we're gonna pull ;)
---
No one is denying that Fear Ward is super nice, and probably the strongest priest racial (atleast for healing). I'm just saying that the "roll dwarf or you won't ever be allowed to raid" is bogus.
---
He specifically asked about endgame though. 10hours/week will not be enough for a tank planing to run endgame content.
---
Just do some resaerch about how to join a terrorist group and fbi is gonna do it for you
---
with 10 hours a week those friends will a) outgear him very soon or b) will also be online 10 hours a week and almost never meet him ingame to run a dungeon

Be civil and respectful. Do not attack or harass other users, engage in hate-speech, or attempt to gate-keep discussion.
---
So you mean its better for you, so fuck the vast majority?
---
Im sure the new looks were before that
---
My story began in WotLK and I had a great time until the end of MoP. But I was always a person, who loved leveling. It took me such a long time to get to max level, because I loved leveling so much. I also argumented for things in the game that were more like classic was and everybody laughed at me, because of this. Somewhere inside of me, I think I always was a Classic WoW guy, even if I never played it.
---
WoD was only bearable to me, because it was WoW and was still nostalgic. Legion changed that. I quit with the Legion pre patch, because this was not WoW anymore. The animations looked bad, no class felt good to play anymore. Not even the fire mage I leveled up that time or the hunter, it was awful. No class was fun anymore in Legion. I had to quit. I came back, leveled up to max, quit again, because Legion was so awful to me, then came back before BfA, did Suramar, found Suramar to be quite beautiful, then had BfA and played until January. I met a new friend through an interesting story, but anyways, anything felt like a chore, so I had to quit again and I won't touch this game again. It is just not worth it. Classic is. And I have lost any hope for Retail WoW now. If I see the new graphics, they only remind me of a game that doesn't feel like a game, and of the part of WoW that ruined it all for me.
---
The way I remember it is chinese looks spikey and angry, Japanese looks squiggly and cute, it's korean if it's got lots of circles and ovals and Thai has lots of n's, u's and w's.
---
Any class is supposed to beat any class if the player is more skilled than the opponent. The classic you want is not the classic everyone else wants. The rest of us want it to be like vanilla was, where skill was what mattered.
---
I played almost every day in Vanilla but lost interest during TBC. I came back for a short time during WotL and again during Cataclysm. After that I wasn't interested in WoW any more. I hated the empty world, the 10-minute- dungeon runs where nobody communicated. And after Blizz even destroyed the old content there was no reason for me to come back.
---
I reactivated my account 2 weeks ago to pass the time till Classic launches, but the state of retail WoW makes me upset. It almost feels like a shared world shooter with a single player campaign. So instead I started playing Warcraft 3 (much better experience!).
---
Cloth on a paladin, period accurate.
---
I use wifi to connect ti my cellphone hotspot.
---
I played A LOT in Vanilla and TBC. PVE PVP. Did pretty much every raid, arena, etc.
---
WOTLK: I didn't like DK in PVP versus my priest. Something just felt off. Too many abilities and stuff. I took a break after casual gearing. Didn't feel like going back to raiding because I had geared so many times in PVE before.
---
CATA: Started a mage and PVPed like crazy. Loved how many slots I could enchant. I became a beast and enjoyed the expansion, even though community was lacking. Little to no interaction with other players.
---
MOP: Leveled and enjoyed it. I loved the feel and estetics. It felt a bit easy. Didn't like the direction PvP were going. Quit soon after doing initial dungeons, etc.
---
WOD: Started PVEing with my old guild. Was main tank and had a great time actually. Guild kind of fell apart as soon as we had completed the second raid - also my progression with PUG raids were A LOT better than progression with my guild, so it all felt meaningless.
---
Legion: Joined late in the expansion, and i must say it felt utterly crap. After 1 month I had decent gear and it was sooo boring.
---
BFA: Played for 2 months and had a great time. But I was so dissapointed by professions. Everything seemed so easy to get. No enchants? No gems? Flasks and food for free on AH. No community. PUGed raids until I got Jaina on Heroic and had full HC gear. Took me 2 months and never saw a reason to continue the weekly loot chest bullshit. Was a bit like farmville. OK entertainment for 2 months, but nothing more.
---
Now I really look forward to Classic!
---
Take 2 weeks off and nolife after release. You may find a raid then and get a foot in the door. In the first year BWL/MC is possible in &lt;10 hours/week as long as you can attend to most of the raids.
---
More likely you have to play fury in raids (and gather tanking gear there). Then it may be possible to get a tanking spot in a slower raidgroup thanks to the gear you already have.
---
tell us more
---
You’re
---
Unfortunately Im drawn to play a dwarf priest but several friends are dead set on horde. As my available playtime wont always line up with them anywy ill be rolling a druid toon to play with them casually(mostly pvp wont be doing raids on the bear) and still main my priest in my maintime. I did choose druid for the alt as its very gear independent, easy to level, and not only viable but relatively simple in pvp. just dont expect to be progressively raiding on 2 toons, even if you got both to 60 in competeive time the raid prep would probably burn you out.
---
Battery life is about 2-3 hours.
---
for playing wow.

---
Never mind shattered halls, first time a group from my BWL guild hit ramparts we got stomped by the last boss until we ran and got our FR gear. We got him, but it was a sobering experience
---
Fury warriors are literally the highest DPS of any class end game.
---
I tried it on beta and only got the Mana regen buff when DS killed the mob. I thought it was bugged completely for a while. But admittedly, I haven't tested it since the last update.

I'll test later today and update my post if this was changed.
---
You guys don't have Joe rogan playing on the second monitor while playing WoW? Weird.

That's true though so you're probably right in that t2 has the highest floor in looks of all sets even if there is a few single sets of that have a higher ceiling

Tbh Vanilla vets are a very intimidating breed. They're the big swinging d\*cks of WoW that get all the p\*ssy. They're the elite that crashed the world market in 2008, just to punish the world. They're the judges between peace and apocalypse. Even Navy SEALs, old Nazi SSers and ISISers cower when they are throwing their weight around on the internet. If you ever come across one in WoW, best to step aside and lower yourself to a non-threatening position, because if you aggravate them, they *will* ruin your WoW career, steal your woman, your boots, clothes, and motorcycle.

I wouldn't care personally. I was a guild leader in Vanilla.  We weren't super hardcore, but we were on the serious side.  If someone was lacking the gear and was a part of our main team or even secondary, then we rectified it by getting the shit they needed.
---
Very rare did one or even two players slightly gimped cause a raid to fail.
---
Cancelling flight paths was already a thing back in Vanilla, you just had to log out mid-flight and once you logged in it would drop you at the next flight point. The button doesn't change the functionality of the game at all, just gives you a more convenient method to do it.
---
by immature behavior i am reffering to trolls in particular... most females i know that play multiplayer games use a voice emulator in order to avoid freaks or so to speak immature guys who react oddly when they hear a female voice in raid channels...
---
What about dungeons? Would be a disaster if healer and tank are on different layers
---
Well if you gonna oom at least use the mana on something production instead of making the pala use cleanse twice.
---
They will also be on horde what's the point here?
---
Grey quests do give exp upon completion but the exp is a set amount for the level you are doing them so at 60 a level 10 quest will probably give coppers extra in money after the conversion, the mobs to do the quest will give none whatsoever though.
---
I rather queue one hour a day to login than living with layering.
---
Well, as anyone can understand when listening or reading about the development of WoW understands that the guys didn't actually know exactly what they were doing when developing an MMORPG, the interface is about the most difficult thing to get right, spare yourself some pain and take help from people who knows just how to make a simple and easy to use UI by downloading a few add-ons :)
---
A well geared prot warrior is an excellent flag carrier in WSG, not quite as elusive or fast as a druid but they're harder for a lot of classes to kill so for some premade setups they can actually work better.
---
Melee leeway wasn’t even in the game back in Vanilla. We had Aoe leeway which was introduced in patch 1.3 but melee leeway was never a thing even with the lag. It was a mechanic that got introduced after Cata I believe
---
My 2010 laptop can run 1.12 client(pserver), but it can’t run Legion properly. I died so many times in the mythic+ just because I can’t see the ground effect on lower setting. I think I might need an upgrade in upcoming Classsic :(
---
Only one for now. I intend rolling on a PVP realm and different servers isn't appealing tbh.
---
Why princess specifically? Her ring was something I was gonna need to farm.
---
&gt;In your logic what is the complete hard counter to frost mage?
---
It's called warlocks
---
While everything being contested is a pain in the ass on huge clusterfuck private servers,therr is something to be said about pigging content on these: There's alwsys people onlibe, and it's super eZy to find groups. I think 6k would be perfect if they jacked spawns up a tiny bit.

Hi, /u/Just_WoW_Things

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to be low effort.

---
&gt; On the other hand, Warlocks can't get Imp Shadow Bolt or their curses rolling before trash mobs die, which makes their overall damage awful
---
If mobs die so fast, why are you so worried about the lock losing 15% damage? Fear doesn't pull extra mobs if you juggle it with Curse of Recklessness, which is what any good lock can do. Mage can Polymorph 1 target and Frost Nova melee mobs for a bit. That's so much CC. Almost as much as full CC on 2 targets + a third conditional.
---
Will
---
If that's confirmed before release I'm cheating and levelling on a PvE realm.
---
Go with mining and skinning or mining and herbalism if you don't want to level engi straight away (I recommend taking 2 gatherings and going back for engi, the extra gold from the second gathering prof will help a lot whilst levelling.)
---
hey dalaran
---
1. check out Skarm Tank on youtube.
---
2. viable and even preferable at some points but more effort to convince a guild you know your stuff.
---
   1. farming crowd pummelers from gnomerland(I dont care to spell check this). this will be your openning weapon to build threat all of classic.
---
   2. the trinket from ZG to prevent taunt miss later on.
---
   3. consider BS for the fear trinket but its not like every boss in the game has fear and ally dwarf priests will have fear ward.
---
3. you'll be "geared up" quicker for MC but wont get much from raiding until BWL. Expect warriors to pass you up especially if fury tanking is viable in classic.
---
4. armor will come naturally and you'll likely hit the cap easily with buffs+elixer. this means focussing on health to become a THIC sponge
---
5. your rotation is bear form, use crowd pummeler, maul, then maul again, then maul more.. occasionaly use bash to stun/interrupt also faerie fire in there somewhere. Personally I can see that getting very boring as with a warrior you have panic buttons and get to manage your mitigation. A bear just mauls for threat and assumes the healers are gonna make it work.
---
I thought about this, but i decided that the money spend on a 2nd subscription is better spend on buying gold for me. As i dont have enough time to level a alt while i want my main to see end game.
---
&gt;most people just vendor it i
---
  
---
I will be buying so much of that leather at vendor+a few copers stack then, and making armor from it that vendors for far more than the leather. it's win/win, they don;t even need to go to a malbox.
---
na, first few patches mc had random t2 loot too but that got changed rater quick. 1.4 i think it was when mc got the loot revamped
---
Yeah, one of the reasons I consider feral Druid.
---
We're going back to hell, but we'll love it. There and back again.
---
I might be getting old. Can someone tell me what a «Boomer» is?
---
me 2!
---
BM hunters, rogues and warriors are usually the top 3 DPS classes in TBC raiding once you're at T6 levels of gear, before then BM isn't that hot but it's still pretty good.
---
Stopped at Cata. Couldn't stand the lack of wild PvP anymore, nor that my server used to be very active in Wild PvP but all the great guilds disbanded. Came back at MoP and WoD because a friend conviced me to try, but I didn't last a month. Hated both expansions because of talent trees, teleports everywhere, fyling mounts, and generally speaking, the hunter gameplay I loved until Cata was gone.
---
I misread your comment and thought you were referring to cross-realm pvp. I am not a supporter of layering. I agree.
---
&gt; paladin which is probably the best 1v1 solo class ingame
---
You forgot your /s at the end I think - and if you didn't then you know about the game much less than you think you do.
---
By vanilla definitions that would probably be BWL onward.
---
Who told you that?
---
*Laughs in Paladin*
---
Yes, it was... that is literally why this whole complaining about it is opposed by a lot of people too. This was in vanilla exactly the way it is in Classic, zero difference.
---
Why though?
---
Consumables help but are hardly required till naxx. I think maybe 3 or 4 people in my guild used consumables (other than healing pots) and we managed up to twin emps.
---
You can still get the classic experience without yelling at your parents or having acne...
---
You asked for changes I showed you them.
---
&gt; This is classic we want, not bfa
---
then you want leeway. ok
---
It seems years of staring at [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#s](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#s) made me think that's how they looked in Vanilla too.

---
No critique at all, if you are a newer player I'm sure it felt pretty nice to solo him, like others have written though Hogger can be soloed by all classes pretty much. Might be surprising but even something like a lvl 10 untwinked warrior can solo him if you have gotten 1 or 2 health pots beforehand either from drops, bought from the traveling salesman npc in the zone or from a questreward( think you can get 2 from a quest). It's extremely hard to solo as a warrior but it's possible. You basically hamstring kite him with rend up. Will probably have to bandage twice and pot twice as well. Also you should have gotten some rockets as a questreward which can be used against him.
---

---
I can't find this copy pasta, did you just make it up, or where does it come from?
---
Uh oh! :)
---
I'm Australian and I'll definitely be rolling on an Oceanic server if they have them.  I can't imagine they'll have many, but hopefully at least one.
---
If there aren't any Oceanic servers then I'll probably become a Classic WoW tourist. Create a character and check things out for a week or two and bail.  The lag killed me more than it should have in vanilla so I'm not going down that path again.
---
T3 is awesome, if any paladin tier set is ugly it's the T2,5.
---
A lot of legit leaks do come out of 4Chan, though. Its anonymity makes it a place where people do come out and drop bombs that are true, but that also means it's a place where people come out and drop bombs that are false.
---
Bag space and time
---
Old tier 2 (old look too) removed from MC from patch 1.4. New models were added 1.6 with BWL along with new looks to the old model. 1.9 was when the old models no longer existed within the game.
---
Yeah I think transmog as a concept is fine personally, but not when you can go back and farm old gear. If they made it so you could only transmog gear if you had it when it was current content (within the same expansion) I'd be all for it
---
The T3 doesn’t even looks like it belongs to a Paladin. 
---
The color scheme, the... ???razor blades??? As shoulders. The blue dots all over the thing..: crystals I guess? 
---
At least the T1 stays Paladin-esque with its golden plate color scheme and it’s “holy” like appearance. The T3 looks like it’s somewhere stuck between a Rouge wearing plate armor, a battlemage or a warrior with bad taste. 
---
Big turn off for me. I hope Naxx is far far away.
---
I have a feeling tier 2 epic armor is the 0.5 set, not BWL.  I 100% had the updated ten storms set on my guilds first few clears of BWL when it was released.
---
I totally forgot about the rockets this is good advice ! About the harmstring kiting it's not really viable in Classic because of the leeway
---
Lol you can’t get better DPS than that group. Half the trash packs in heroics can’t even be DPS’ed by melee. A wind fury totem won’t so shit.
---
No, you are mis-remembering.
---
Those old models were removed 1.4 because they stopped dropping in MC. The new tier 2 look was added in tier 1.6 along with the old models being updated. 1.9 is when they removed the tier 1 old model from the game files and fixed some of the particle effects. 
---
You can watch videos from old patches and see that the new tier 2 models were in 1.6. They are even in the BWL launch trailer and official patch 1.6 trailer.
---
T3 looks like a space suit
---
Its so epic that you can get into hyjal.
---
I thought it meant someone born during the 50s and 60s but lately here it seems to mean someone who is NOT frothing screaming something about for the horde and being edgy. Hence I'll gladly be a boomer if it means Im not that other option.
---
hard counters to frost mages:
---
shadow-priest, ele-shaman, feral/resto-druid
---
classes with decent or equal chances against frostmages (where skill actually matters a little):
---
rogue, hunter (bm), warlocks, paladins
---
classes which in no way ever should have the slightest chance against a frostmage:
---
warrior
---
You'll only ever pull off a win as warrior vs frost mage one time with a Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector. After that if he isnt completely terrible, he will bait it out 100% of the times you use it, besides he can just go into iceblock 2x for 10s each (because he wont ever need it anyway for anything else the warrior could do), whereas your reflector lasts 5s on 5 min cd.

---
don't invite the boosters back? yeah that makes no sense
---
there have been some addons, experience fu, money fu, killcount etc...
---
i could not find any of them updated for classic so i started writing my own addon. far from finished. at the moment i only track money and i have no beta to test it so i relay on release and hope the api changes wont affect the result.
---
but still got a few weeks to finish it. i want to integrate:
---
time played per level
---
money made per level
---
money made per hour
---
money made per seasson
---
money made from grey items
---
money made from gold loot
---
mobs killed per level
---
mobs killed overall
---
mobs per categorie (humanoid beast etc)
---
items looted per categorie
---
instances entered
---
instances completed
---
herbs gathered
---
ores mined
---
time spent regenerating
---
time spent in combat
---
time spent afk in ogrimmar
---
if you have something you want to add i'll aprechiate it.
---
Yea T2,5 is an abomination. All in all the set is ugly af. It’s even worse that Warrior &amp; Paladin shared the same looks. 
---
Wtf blizz?! Had enough time to design a whole raid but couldn’t design 2 different sets?!
---
From my understanding, having usually been in the pvp community on every private server, and having multiple r14 friends on both low pop and high pop pservers, it matters how many people contribute. I remember on Nost PvE, we had to whisper people leveling and convince them to get 15 kills, just so there would be enough people contributing so that our r13 warrior could progress every week. 
---
We had a priest that was at r13 with almost no progress with number 1 standing for a month. He made it, but he was almost insane at the end.
---
That being said, it might have been different in vanilla. I don't remember it being that, but the calculations might have been different under the hood at the time without me being aware.
---
And that T3 helmet visor "Vageta what does the scouter say about his power level?"
---
you my friend, deserve a like :D
---
Feel free to try the same thing as that lvl 9 paladin against hogger without any buffs, or with any other class if you feel like it, and i bet that you will fail miserably, Therefore my statement about paladins being the best 1v1 due to heals CC and overall tankyness is correct, hogger hits like a truck on all cloth wearers and hunters get mend pet in lvl 12  And as i recall there are no chance a warrior or rogue straight out of goldshire are able to do this alone unless using hamstring + running around for 15 minutes around a tree healing up with bandages.
---
Which other class would you say are able to do hogger this clean other than paladin in lvl 10, priests go oom before killing him, and the mage in video were able to kill him due to ding thereby countering the mana issue.
---
Don’t really need it
---
Im guessing you are not familiar with maul threat scaling vs flat tank threat
---
9% higher parry will not diminish druid with crowd pummeler skyrocketing threat over any warrior regardless of gear.
---
Warrior has to choose tank gear or threat gear. Druids maintain superior threat in the tank hear. Both threat and migitation is less affected in resistance gear as well, where warriors become severely hit on both threat and migitation
---
Did you loose raid spot to druid or something?
---
This is not correct. Some items require the spec as well.
---
See a lot of people saying enchanting and tailoring. Enchanting isn’t worth it, vendoring the greens or putting them on AH is more profitable early on. Tailoring is nice for the bags, but if you play a class that can’t heal, remember you also NEED to level first aid. Otherwise you’re gonna die a fuckton.
---
Depends on guild. Ours in vanilla was "lets help you get up to speed bro, we have alts to play with you anyway".
---
I intent to keep that attitude
---
Wow, I didn't remember this at all. That shaman is sporting my level 20 warrior's \[Grunt Pauldrons of the Bear\].
---
I love the T2.5 set on my Dwarf Paladin.  Looks amazing with the Scarlet Crusade tabbard.  Same with the Dwarf Warrior T2.5 set and a Silverwing tabbard.
---
Now put either of those sets on a human... Yuck!!
---
It’s not really some amazing altruistic attitude, it’s guild management 101. Gear is an easy problem to solve, being a bad or unreliable or unlikable player are things that are very hard to solve.
---
Can you actually reach the Shift-0 hotkey?
---
Alliance is also severely underplayed in current wow. Only 24 guilds have cleared the latest raid on the hardest difficulty, 2 months after release.
---
"Should be" guild management basics. Sadly, many don't see it that way.
---
And sadly it's a necesarry evil to do so... I always thought it was just another thing people overreact about, and it only happens rarely, until I played with a female friend of mine... The moment she joins voice chat in any game, the entire conversation shifts to focus on her being a girl... It's ridiculous. Half the time people give her shit because girls can't play video games, or at least not as good as men. The other half desperate dudes are trying to score with her in truly pathetic ways... Like damn people you don't even know what she looks like or what she's like, literally all you know is she's playing a video game...
---
A few months is way too long, 2 weeks I could accept but several months would have a monumental impact on the economy if nothing else.
---
Mainly interested in the reasons of why people left and are coming back 👍🏻 karma doesn't seem to be doing that great, but I'm loving the comments! #commentwhoring
---
two different teams
---
I don't like either to be honest.
---
Nope because I never rolled on a pve server
---
I PVPed almost exclusively in vanilla (though I stopped at about 60% through R13 due to work commitments) but I paid 1000g for the priest quest item off Major Domo for the staff.  Since I didn't get the R14 weapons Anathema was a good alternative.
---
I mean technically you can toggle pvp on and maybe someone will come to you, but for the most part there just isnt a wPvP scene at all on PvE servers. I played on one exclusively from vanill through WotLk and never did any wPvP.
---
Most people on a PvE server rolled there because they didn't understand the difference because they're new, or precisely because they dont want to wPvP.
---
Stopped raiding after TBC, played a little in WotLK and Cata but then stopped completely. Looking forward to playing in a world that feels like a world again, and without microtransactions.
---
Just dont mention sharding and they wont ban you!
---
You can pretty much tank most(a few exceptions here and there) all content as a feral.
---
We have no idea since they decided to keep the Classic blue posts to the minimum for some reason. In my video you can clearly see Hogger hitting me while i'm like 10 foots away from him
---
Buy the ticket,take the ride.
---
Any chance you can provide the file for this?  I'd love to contribute and make an Ally version!
---
Would raid nights Tuesday/Thursday 7-11pm EST undoable?
---
You could at least share with the others the source of this information. This website has a great guide for every class : https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/warlock/leveling-1-60/
---
Clearly you never played vanilla kid. Skill was everything back then. It did not matter at all which class you played, the outcome was determined by skill every single time. This is patch 1.12 we are talking about. We can all see you are incredibly low IQ and are thinking of early vanilla, when Classic has absolutely nothing to do with that. The reality is that if you think a warrior could not beat a frost mage in vanilla, you just really fucking sucked at the game.
---
All i see is hunter gear
---
Just keep that crap in Retail. Stop pleading Blizz for it. All I'm asking. Keep as much as possible of what makes retail different from vanilla....in retail. You can all pretend to be high warlords on your level 1 milliion tauren paladins or whatever in retail.
---
Back then if you FD and don't move by the end of 6 minutes you automatically died.
---
You found someone who wants to PvP in Desolace, the one area where people who have Gankathon Vale have to go?
---
Impressive.
---
Let people enjoy their success
---
Honestly to each their own, but IMO at the core of the game it’s essentially Horde vs Alliance and that means PvP. 
---
Blizzard’s mistake is giving player’s a choice. There should only be PvP servers and a few RP servers.
---
Haha, at first I also wasn't quite sure since peeps should play WC3 of they want to experience the more before classic (not really related, but gives context to the world)
---
Not happening in classic, fam
---
haha, yeah why not i'll put it on the bucket list
---
I agree, T5 was the best mage set. T4 was pretty good too
---
Yes. A lot of people don't want a recreation of actual vanilla. They want the game like they are used to it from private servers. Those don't have most of the blizzlike bugs and quirks if they are not fun to play with.
---
Titan panel can track a lot of what you're looking to track.
---
Questie purely for giving me a general idea of where things are in the world. Beyond that, I'm good. I find working out which quests to do when myself part of the fun.
---
Number of front flip jumps for Nelfs also needed.
---
Thank you!!!!
---
a noob is a person who thinks themselves infalible and i would rather explore all options even those i earlier considered foolish in order to expand my horizon.
---
answer or get out, i know the value of the stone but that does not reduce my curiosity to how things will function.
---
I normally never go pvp servers. But this time around it does not really matter. I just wanna faff about in nostalgia. I think I will join a pvp server for that added layer of things to do. But I will never gank anyone either.
---
Are you 100% certain about this, because this is huge news to me.
---
None of those would affect the class balance present in vanilla. Removing melee leeway would.
---
Does drowning damage break the sap?
---
there are only 2 counters to this.
---
1. you join her and you use the voice emulator as there wont be such a strong focus then.
---
2. she uses it and sounds like a dude.
---
patched in bc iirc.
---
Also anyone who cared to play has been stuck at 40 with nothing to do for the last few weeks.
---
Arathi Hochland has a nice ring to it.
---
I would say it's more like from Scholomance up to ZG and maybe AQ20, including dungeon sets and AV stuff. 
---
That's also endgame and in my opinion daily 10 hours is more likely to give you these things instead of BWL level stuff.
---
But... Maybe I sucked so hard in Vanilla and I had shitty friends on a shitty realm that we thought T2 content and onwards is really just for absolute nolifers.
---
Have you been raiding BWL and Naxx in Vanilla?
---
What do you expect? It's been capped at 40 for a long time. There is only so much to do. They need to bump it to 50 and it'll spike again. But at this point they probably will just leave it or do another stress test before ending it.
---
&gt;We will know **what servers (and how many)** we are getting **in just over a month**
---
Really hoping for this.
---
I think the issue I have with it is no confirmation from any dev about how layering will be implemented in the game.
---
You're right about the whole point of the beta is to point out bugs, and devs have "discussed" layering on different occasions, but nothing official has been said yet.
---
I think that's why people are still concerned about layering, the uncertainty of how it will impact the game.
---
How easy if it just to get one character to /follow the other in the same party and sponge XP that way?
---
Provide a source or your comment is disregarded.  Here this is what providing evidence looks like: notice how he doesn’t get hit even with the mob almost on top of him.
---
https://youtu.be/5frS6BjaiD8?t=121
---
There’s many more examples in the video and we can clearly see how the beta differs from actual vanilla footage
---
Horde is probably gonna be my 3rd or 4th alt so that's gonna take a couple of years :P
---
Well TIL, thanks dude
---
Aaaaah.
---
Lock only quests and their respective levels. There are the pets, One for an OH/staff. Infernal quest. I think one that gives a robe. Can't really remember them all now.
---
It wasn’t part of vanilla. 
---
Mobs had a set respawn timer and that time did not change with player population in the area. 
---
There’s a blue post under “not a bug”.
---
When vanilla released I had to convince my parents to pay a subscription to a game so I started vanilla about three weeks late. My irl friend started on a PVE and we regretted when we got near level 50 because we were very into pvp. We’ve played private servers since then and honestly pvp servers are great since it gives you another layer of content. Getting ganked sucked so I can see why some people prefer PVE servers
---
Hexenmeister
---
So you can see the 1.3 patch note. Also please look at old vanilla footage such as 
---
You can clearly see that melee leeway isn’t working the way it is in the beta
---
Could you perhaps please post a high resolution version of this image? I'm going to level a warlock as well and would love to have this to hand.
---
Thanks!
---
Nothing else is bound on the side of the keyboard other than “0” - so he presses shift with the left hand and smashes his face on the right side of the keyboard.
---
It’s probably to feed pet.
---
How would you macro chainlightning taking prio over lightning bolt on clearcast though?
---
You forgot I can also walk on water, bow down plebs.
---
That's just not true, there is one AH per server not per layer
---
It’s a shame since I love the look of the trol Ivory and Mottled raptors.
---
I never played PVE but i know it would make me mad, if im out in the world farming and someone from the opposite faction is contesting me, its in my interest to fight over those resources and take over the area.
---
But their reason for being is the same.  And the effect of it is hurting players now.
---
Thank you very much for watching, I really appreciate that!
---
Being able to pay for a transfer, I don't know.
---
Blizzard allowed free transfers from PvE to PvP and I left Alleria and went to Magtheridon.  There were several servers to choose from, Magtheridon wasn't my only choice for free transfer.  I'm not even sure they were in the same battle group either.
---
Best run I ever did in vanilla was BRD full run with 4 holy priests and me as shadow priest for tanking bosses. Smoothest run I've ever done in there.
---
What are the gear independent classes?
---
Nope, I did clear bwl (server first) and I remember clearly having quiet a few nemesis gear and yes I had the cobra shoulders and such.
---
The switch is more or less a high end cellphone hardware wise. So it's probably possible
---
I will never roll on a PvE server. I don't want to remove a big part of the gameplay just because i can't stand frustration. It's part of the game, only carebears want to win everytime.
---
Yeah exactly 😊
---
And the banana shoulders ... and the banana helm ...
---
How hard was it for you to find groups as a rogue? Heard that pservers might have had quite high numbers of rogues.
---
Thinking instead of rolling a warrior, tanking at 60 and finding gear for offtanking and mainly fury and then reroll for a guild but unsure how easy it is to find a guild as such? Have any experience there that you could help out with :)
---
In retail vanilla I only got to experience MC/ZG/AQ20. On private servers I've cleared all content.
---
Hogger POV - that's what leveling as a warrior on a pvp server looks like
---
Well with like &lt;1000 Beta invites only for streamers and active subs (if you have luck) everyone is playing retail now... the real classic fans don't have an active sub. I have no sub since wotlk (beginning) im playing classic on p-servers.
---
Well according to one of the three original developers it was.

Correct
---
I got to level 20 on a PvE server and then rolled bc a gnome was fishing in the barrens outside of WC and I couldn't squish it
---
Yeah, no, fuck you. PvP servers aren't everyones cup of tea, and who the fuck do you think you are, trying to force people to play on a server they don't want to play on? You know that PvE servers are actually called "normal" servers, yes? Maybe Blizz should have stuck with that and not even given you the choice to roll on a PvP server. Would you like that, what do you think?
---
Selfish, entitled assholes all around.
---
you can't use your pet on half the raid bosses
---
Spellstones are awesome in pvp and to start some pve fights.
---
Ashenvale GY to BFD gives Desolace some competition.
---
Lol you’re so American
---
Ice Reflector huh?

Or, what's far more likely if you aren't an asshole, you get corpsecamped for hours, and...that's it. If you're not an asshole, you don't corpsecamp people. Period. I also don't like that stupid "an eye for an eye"-attitude. I don't have any interest in perpetuating behaviour that pisses me off, I don't see the need to ruin someones day for fun or for some arbitrary kind of "revenge", just because some stupid asshole did the same to me.
---
An eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind. I don't want any part of this, and maybe, just maybe, you PvP-fanboys could, just once, shut the fuck up and let people enjoy the game the way they want it, without whining and moaning about how PvE servers suck and only carebears play on them and blah blah blah.
---
OP asked if anyone regretted playing on a PvE server. Answer the question or don't, but cut the crap of telling him what to roll, because it's just better and cooler and that were the l33t kids are. You guys piss me off to no end.
---
Oh really? Why tho
---
Chat is not layer based
---
This is why i wanna play prot paladin. If only they had taunt and could tank raids and not a meme spec 😣
---
laughs in Spirit Form
---
That’s funny, then why is wow doing exactly what runescape did? Blizzard could certainly take the ideas of osrs and implement some of them into classic wow to turn it into an ever evolving game that the players decide what happens and what content gets added.  And osrs does not have micro transactions, maybe RS3. But that’s irrelevant because we aren’t talking about rs3.
---
Crimson (Horde-PvE) is recruiting.
---
Introduction
---
We are a group who have been playing and raiding together for several years now, and are looking to step into Classic and progress at a quick pace. We like to maintain a laid back attitude outside of raiding but go hardcore preparing for and during raids to make quick progress.
---
Goals
---
To be the best guild on our realm, and one of the best in classic, while we maintain a good quality community of friends.
---
What we are looking for 
---
Solid players who want to push the limits of Classic and their class, while also being reliable and able to make our raid schedule.
---
Looting 
---
For our 40man raids, Loot council is current plan, though DKP is still on the table. In 20mans, when available, we will generally roll for items except a few exceptional items.
---
Schedule
---
Our tentative raid times are Monday: 19:00-23:00 CET Wednesday: 19:00-23:00 CET Thursday: 19:00-23:00 CET Sunday: 19:00-23:00 CET
---
We shall use extra raid days to do guild dungeons, 20man raids, and farming when 40man raids are cleared for the week.
---
We require 90% Raid attendance.
---
If you are interested. Message me on my discord Oulous#4513 or you can apply via our google doc https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11JF0rQKy_JjLpj32w1uO-fxZrCyi-rj2Rh9fQ_cCIgc/edit
---
&gt;6 - 9 PST, 7 - 10 MST, 8 - 11 CST, 9 - 12 EST
---
AM or PM?
---
The only reason I really want to use a quest addon is for it to tell which specific quests are actually zone breadcrumb quests. 
---
I know redridge only has a few quests available until you do its intro chain that takes you to SW and then opens up a bunch more quests. I know there are several zones like this and all I need is an addon to highlight these specific things while I can handle the rest myself.
---
They do dumb shit that can wipe the raid, and sometimes the just... die
---
You've delivered the best news I've heard in weeks. Thank you so much.
---
I never show helmet anyway. Want everyone to see my pretty face
---
Just buy gold from some inoffical site.
---
Ironforge? Isn't it "Eisenschmiede"?
---
I personally prefer the english names ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Yeah you don't raid as BM 
---
That's the solo spec
---
&gt;In retail vanilla I only got to experience MC/ZG/AQ20.
---
Same for me. Maybe Classic will be the same as private servers and not like Vanilla where T2 content is unreachable for casuals. I failed hard time in PVE when I was playing retail Vanilla so if everyone improved as much as I did the whole content should be trivial, but I still think 10 hours a week will be low for Naxx.
---
From what I remember, the old ones were place holders that dropped from the end of MC, by the time BWL dropped the correct models were available. I had complete T2 in BWL, way before AQ.
---
I rerolled as a warrior after getting bored of my mage. For the most part I felt very strong while running around alone. Really the only class I felt helpless against was a mage. Even then, most didnt know how to use nova and blink properly so it was pretty easy to close the gap.
---
Obviously it's very gear dependent Also if you are partied with a shaman, you become an unstoppable killing machine. I remember grinding AV for the last few levels and getting TUF as soon as I hit 60. Queued up AB with a shaman and easily was #1 on leaderboard even though I was full greens outside of TUF.
---
While warlock may be a hard match up it's certainly not a complete hard counter. A good frost mage will not automatically loose to a good warlock. I don't agree.
---
I will really look into this. And from what i heard a lot of bosses do only tank damage so i thought thats a positive for bm
---
Well you use MM/BM Spec for raid if you have enough hit.
---
lett 9% hit MM/SV
---
 https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cbZViohthtIV0r0h 
---
\&gt;9% hit MM/BM
---
 https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cx0G0xZViohthtG 
---
Only BM is not viable, your pet will die pretty fast becuase it will get cleaved/aoe'd down. Normally you use a wolf for furious howl during raid to give your group the buff. Thats all. :)
---
Hahah holy crap, I completely forgot about this.
---
Improved imp is a meme
---
Fel stamina is a waste of 5 points until you have raid gear and it can impact life tap and/or pvp
---
Siphon life is worth to kill 2 mobs at once, which you should be doing ASAP
---
Improved drain soul is absolutely worth it, always awards unless you’re not using it when mob dies
---
Suppression is already on here but you don’t need it immediately, can be delayed indefinitely depending on your leveling route as while leveling it is very mediocre dps increase
---
it’s better to go ahead and go SM/Ruin unless you are having threat issues with your VW, which you shouldn’t be unless you’re not pulling 2 mobs or are shadowbolting
---
On the wands you’re absolutely right, make friends with an enchanter in your guild ASAP or in my guilds case we have a dedicated crafted making wands for all leveling casters that need them
---
I had most of bloodfang before AQ came out, it did not looke liek red shadowcraft. I was runnning around in sweet bloodfang for the event, may even have a recording somewhere.
---
Point is, this is for sure wrong.
---
What classes are less gear dependent?
---
I love the Rogue one - I have a transmog set of it!
---
Every hardcore guild Will use worldbuffs and full consumes. They do on all private servers. Heck, even semi casual guilds do. Classic wont be harder, if anything easier.
---
/woosh
---
T1 is good minus the helm.
---
So how do you deal with thousands of players in starting zones?
---
*laughs in Wisp Form*. Underrated racial
---
I mean even if you wanted to raid as bm guilds won't take you, there are very few spots for hunters in the first place.
---
Oh thanks. I will save those talents
---
That's how I remember it. As a warrior I'd always use ww once I was out of range because I knew it would hit.
---
I have no clue I have not played a caster at all
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
that's why it's so nice that everyone can decide for themselves what they find funny and what they don't.
---
Probably questie
---
You talking about hardcore guilds, i do not want to join one
---
I think the "updated art" is just the icons. Or they slightly changed the textures or something, but still the new models.
---
Now i understand why i ended up playing hunter back at vanilla, the feeling just surged back
---
If I go priest and enchanting how soon will I be able to craft my first wand?
---
They changed those back for classic because it was only changed in an addon later on, dunno which one tho
---
Well yeah you may be able to find a non progression guild that will take you but that's kind of a shit show in my experience.
---
Didn't even spent the talent point during the fight...
---
0/10 totally a noob, never even played vanilla for sure! 
---
/s
---
With 10 hours a week of play time you can easily tank. You probably won't be a big time main tank, but you can 100% be an off tank who shows up to help when he can. 
---
If you wanna tank while leveling, that's gonna be a good number of dungeons. Or you can level as Dps up til about 56/57 then throw together a green/blue tank set and do the last few levels in Strat Scholo and BRD. Getting gear as you level for the tank set and some good learning experience for how to handle the dungeons.
---
That wasn't the case in classic, but it's so minor it doesn't really matter...
---
Any1 who has completed (insert challenging number) keystone mythics will wipe the floor with vanilla vets that have done nothing the past decade.
---
Are they all going on the same PvP server?
---
Shift-8? How fucking big hands do you have lol
---
we called it.power ranger suit
---
Yes. And I actually liked the Hellfire Citadel one
---
Sweet dude but i think he does wayyy to little damage... i mean 24-26 per hit ?
---
It just sounds hilarious anytime groups it into "Asia" as there are 20 entirely different worlds. It would take 5 minutes to learn a little bit and know for ever. It always stands out when someone who hasn't travelled speaks about it.
---
I thought the PVP set looked pretty nice.
---
Couldn't you just make macros for all your offense casts but put a stopcast command at the start of it?
---
That way, if clearcasting procs while you're in the midst of casting a lighting bolt, you could just hit your chain-lightning spell macro (which would cancel the lightning bolt in progress) and have that use it?
---
Not sure if that's what you meant or were looking for.
---
Yeah, one costs time and one costs gold. OP's question was about leveling a profession while leveling. So if you take the cloth you get from leveling, which is slightly more than the average player if you grind humanoid mobs to level, and turn it into bags, then you get to level your tailoring (not at max efficiency), make some money on the side, and level up. My Pserver experience was that if you priced it out, selling the cloth on the AH was the same or slightly less  profitable than turning it into bags, so even if it's the other way in classic, you still come out with gold and increased tailoring. Is it max efficiency? No. Is it max money? Possibly not, but that depends on an economy I can't predict. Is it doable without a large gold cost to a casual leveler? Yes, if you are ok with not being at 300 tailoring the second you reach 60.
---
The big about buying it was that mats tend to be cheaper on weekends due to the number of people playing. Who knows what will happen in classic.
---
I'm going with Zygor.
---
MM is the most "acceptable" damage tree hunter can have in raids and you can count trueshot aura as deciding factor.  
---
Not everything in vanilla is about pure dps numbers, hunters are brought for their utility (nature resistance aura for cretain encounters, petbuff, frenzy removal, aoe slow trap is really handy). Surely most of this factors are not build-specific but it explains overall attitude towards hunters in raids.  
---
Also pet is really vulnerable and dies/does not have enough uptime on boss to justify BM + im pretty sure on some fights bad pet positioning could be reason of raid wipe.  
---
Overall it just does not worth it.
---
Edgemasters + Cloudkeeper for that ultimate pre-BiS while the peasants are wearing their devilsaur.
---
Since I'm gonna be playing this game for two reasons- end game PvE and leveling alts, I'm going pure PvE server cause I don't have time to deal with assholes who want to gank.
---
Angry much?
---
I mean. I don't think it's up to any player. It's up to blizzard. If blizzard made only Pvp servers they wouldn't be forcing you to do shit. You either play or you don't. They irony of your post about being "forced" into something while calling him entitled is really really juicy.
---
The problem doesent really exist since every guild will still do MC/BWL because if ingots/legendarys and gear all the way to naxx. So gearing up people who you take in later on should not be a problem as long as they show dedication and attendance
---
You make some assumptions, Blizzard has made some also. 
---
What they plan to do when the initial rush has settled with either low or high populations, they have not shared.
---
Last I remember was about 115 days played.
---
8.7 years out of your last 15 were spend in game?
---
(X) Doubt
---
so nice it was removed by the mods, thanks for being self aware
---
You didn't see venruki beat snutz in the final dueling tournament did you?
---
I'm using a Huawei phone. I would worry about it yes, but there's a difference between "made in The P.R.C" and "funded by the Chinese government" like Huawei is.
---
the government in China funds Huawei so they can steal technology from other companies in other countries like Samsung so China will grow economically. So that's what you should be "scared" about.
---
Yeah, but if they are too deep when they start to drown they probably won't make it out.
---
you're pretty far from home
---
I'm in it for the PvP and even I prefer PvE servers.
---
There's absolutely nothing fun for me personally in being jumped when I'm levelling with absolute zero percent chance of doing anything to retaliate effectively because I'm low-ish HP and have a mob on me.
---
Even endgame I don't find fun in showing up to a dungeon and just dying on the way in and spending 10 mins res running. I love PvP but it just feels better for me to PvP on my own terms same as I do with PvE, rather than just randomly adding res runs, people who are higher level killing you despite zero honor gain, or the AoE blending machine that is uneven world PvP.
---
This guy wants changes.
---
Good example yeah, effective way to get a little extra silver from levels like.. 5-15 or so and get skill points til its grey
---
Fuck, Ashenvale.
---
I agreed with you until you decided to shit on every PvPer because of 1 PvPer's comment. Fuck you.
---
This I am not entirely sure, as far as I know the old assets were completely removed. I think they were all mainly updated beforehand. There were some problems with some of the particle/lighting of tier 2 especially the shoulders and headpieces which were fixed by the patch.
---
I had mainly tier 2 by the time ZG first came out. I have videos then and no where did I have the old school tier 2. I wish blizzard would bring it back but with 1.12 as the model, we wont :(. I wasn't raiding when the first tier 2 look came out.
---
such a stupid joke and I laughed out loud...
---
I even tanked UBRS alot with my fury warrior. You can easlily tank without being prot, for raiding main tank prot is a must tho
---
&gt;the trinket from ZG to prevent taunt miss later on.
---
which one?
---
Come to the Alliance. We have Nelf tiddies
---
boy have you lost your mind cause ill help ya find it
---
We play World of WARcraft, not Peacecraft.
---
There's no reason to assume equal lengths for each phase.
---
Phase one should only be lasting a month or so.
---
Damn... Did you really go 14 levels without a Corruption upgrade?
---
&gt; and time 
---
You're just trolling at this point.
---
Bloodfang is, to this day, my absolute most favorite tier set. It's just neither over the top nor too boring and fits its class perfectly.
---
I can't inmagine Rag not doing down week 1. With layering there will be a stupid amount of people per server where enough 60s will surely find each other trough forums or something to set up a kill.
---
Raiding guilds will use world buffs. Raiding guilds will not waste world buffs for mc.
---
No one is going to waste world buffs and flasks on farmed content.
---
I should add that you should only put the stopcast command in for the chain-lightning macro and not lightning bolt.
---
That way you can still spam your lightning bolt button and then just hit the chain when the proc is up.
---
oh damn thought i had posted full res image, uploaded on mobile and it musta compressed.. https://imgur.com/a/cxnnVKR
---
You can stance dance to berserker stance, pop it, then stance dance back to prot/battle stance and the buff stays. Tank warriors use this ability because they'll generate a shit ton of rage from being hit + the berserker rage generation modifier.
---
I’d look into the lore personally. I didn’t know anything last time and this time I’m reading up on lore and playing wc3 and it’s really fun.
---
This. Troll animayions really are terrible. Male trolls are the only make race who uses female special attacl animations on Horde, which look goofy as hell with the spin thing
---
5-6k imo. The main thing is I need my cities filled with people.
---
I'm confused, when did I say 25% is minor ? \^\^
---
I'm just saying orc warriors can get super frustrating for rogues if they go all out on stun resist, those rogue tears when all their stuns are resisted are sure to be salty.
---
 I think the difference is that OSRS can be free while WoW is sub based. Hopefully they don’t add in any of the cash shop stuff into Classic.
---
I’m pretty optimistic though. It seems like the lead Devs at Blizz want this to go right.
---
Yup, wPvP is fun 1% of the time. Its only fun when you come across someone a similar level to you and you are both full HP so it's an even fight or there's a large wPvP battle agreed by both factions. 99% of the time there is a huge level gap, or it's a 2v1, or you one of you is fighting a mob already, and one of you is the asshole...
---
It’s either gonna be long queues + free transfers, or keep layering beyond phase 1. The latter being more likely than people think despite muh world bosses.
---
It was "a couple of weeks or a month."
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722.2/layering-in-classic-wow
---
Lol what? When did I leave the guild? And in what universe did I ever join Drama?
---
Queues would really be old school. Will be intersting if they can get away with it. 
---
The economy might get broken by super high player numbers. Really curious how they plan to get any kind of balance.
---
The thing that made Vanilla so good was that in LFG you would see messages saying "LF2M Healers MC Full Clear." Right under messages that said "LF2M DPS Naxx Spider Wing." 
---
All Raid/Dungeon content stayed relevant throught the games lifespan without different modes and mythic+.
---
4-6 months
---
15 year hunter experience informs you can choose between marksman or mm. I guess this tree don’t branch, son.
---
Paladins had the best AoE threat generation and good mitigation for it, but they weren't as good single target tanks as warriors were, and lacked a good spell protection ability vs boss mechanics that couldn't be silenced of interrupted.
---
I just started college, when WoW released. A friend talked me and naother into buying the game at EU release. I wasn't even that interested beforehand, but we started playing alliance. One of my friends switched to horde after a week and quit after 3 weeks. The one who talked us into buying the game quit two months in. I stayed and became a hardcore raider. 
---
I absolutely loved the game in vanilla and in tbc. I took a month break here or there, but that's it. Then wrath came and I started to get disillusioned with the terrible heroics and the watered down naxx. Ulduar was great, but ToC brought it back to the dumpster again. That's where I quit the game, not just because of ToC, I still wanted to raid icecrown, but also because my guild broke apart. 
---
I returned a month or so before cataclysm. I liked what I heard about the beta and the new designs. A few friends got me into their guild, I experienced ICC with them and was on the raid roster for Cataclysm. Cata was a blast at first. The heroics were fun, the raids were fun, my class was fun. But the overtuned heroic raids started to erode the guild (bascially, the most hardcore in the guild broke away to a form a 10-man raiding guild, as they felt the player quality wasn't good enough to do 25 man heroic on our server). When 4.1 was announced to return heroic 5 mans back to wrath level I was disillusioned. With the guild breaking apart yet again and I no longer seeing Blizzard making the right choices I quit for the final time in May 2011.
---
It's been now over 8 years since I last played WoW and I'm very excited for classic.
---
Wotlk didnt have phasing and i remember spending most of my time in the world pvping. not really. Tons of SS vs tarren mill, lots of time spend trolling in zul drak.
---
I hit 70. I just didn’t start playing til late into vanilla then TBC came out when I was around 40ish
---
Quite the opposite for me. I rolled on a PvP server with a friend of mine and quickly started to regret it. The first 20 levels were super fun because the early zones don't have PvP enabled but being a complete noob, slowly leveling a warrior on PvP server was absolute garbage.
---
After we rerolled on a PvE server the game became so much more enjoyable to play. World PvP is not for everyone.
---
Just have fun for 2-3 years. If things go well it will be longer, if not you had fun for 2-3 years.
---
I tried getting into BFA after quitting in late Cata...
---
Got AOTC on G’huun and Jaina, then got the fuck out. 
---
You best believe I’m going to be spending half or more of my free time grinding out classic while loving it
---
I never understand when people make such confident assumptions like this lol.  You don’t know this, at all.
---
This makes no sense
---
I always thought dying in Uldaman was an unbelievably far run as well.
---
Of course noone knows. I don't know if Blizzard ever officially addressed this issue and I just haven't seen it.
---
If they've been playing in a monster and never log off just go afk it's Maaaaaybe possible.
---
That or some vicious account sharing.
---
It may, it may not, we just don't know.
---
Are you kidding? Skinning is not some godsend for moneymaking, people are fooling themselves. Too many players waste time skinning when its more profitable and efficient so continue fighting since the mobs themselves give better rewards than bloating your inventory and wasting time running to the mob looting+skinning and looting again. It triples the time.
---
I can completely agree with the total rp experience being not only better but truly unique on an rp server. However, the second option is ok for those that want some limited rp and prefer suitable raid times and better ping over an rp community.
---
The realm transfers are a bit bothersome for other reason that have been stated before. 
---
But for these purposes they are a good evil.
---
yeah either addons (if they work) 
---
or make a macro
---
Are french people not allowed to like American football or something?
---
Phase one will not last only a month. They’re not going to release a new phase when not even 10% of the population is level 60. Phase 1 will last 2-3 months minimum.
---
10 hours a week? Hey, I'd love to join you for dungeons, as damage or healer. You can raid as Fury and try to build up a tank set on the side to help tank on encounters where many are required.
---
You are a dense fuck if you think that sharding and layering achieve the same thing.
---
Not to mention actually just sharing 1 server with everyone actually gave you a reputation. You could actually feel known and respected/feared/loved/hated depending on how you treated everyone in your faction.
---
And BG rivalries?! HOLY fuck that was like cocaine when you saw that guy you had gone head to head with 50 times before charging across WSG.
---
It felt so much more about the community back then.
---
Unrelated hunter question, as you seem to know your stuff. Does the frequency that you have to feed pet diminish over time/levels or is it a constant feed every 4 minutes type thing to keep happiness up?
---
Yikes champ calm your care bear titties and dry those eyes. 
---
Fuck off with your soap box and always remember at the end of the eye for an eye scenario there’s always one guy left standing. He may be down one eye, but he still won. 
---
PvE players might as well not exist in classic.
---
that seems like a close to retarded choice considering that there will be a cooldown on layer jumps thus it will cause extra scenes of groups not being able to form successfull.
---
furthermore how to tell what layer has its town under attack when someone attacks it ?
---
I really can't imagine layering after P1 but we will see I guess.
---
Live to win
---
Aah, I begin to understand. So basically the items that dropped pre-bwl must then have had different itemIDs with the placeholder models and with BWL the new items with the actual models dropped correctly but the other stuff got updated later then. Hmm, weird.
---
The servers can’t handle more people.
---
Lol right? Dude sounds like a pussy.
---
they can easily get out of it.  
---
"sorry everyone, we underestimated how many people would stick around so layering is here to stay for at least a little longer because we want you to be able to play the game not sit in a queue all day" - blue post.  
---
boom, get out of jail free card played, the fans out in full force to support their decision and if you don't like it just quit.
---
Razer naga or something similar
---
This right here.  This one makes the most sense.  Let’s just say worst (best imo) case scenario, every single server didn’t lose one person.... that’s when they can open new realms for overflow, slap on ques on the servers, and allow people to free character transfer off of they choose.
---
Before anyone goes saying “but I’m not leaving the server I made friends on”, then don’t.  I promise you there will be PLENTY of people who will transfer off the server in a heartbeat, just like they always have back in the day.  Maybe there is a streamer on your server people want to get away from, maybe they just want a free name change.
---
Well it would be worse if you were cut off from talking to others on your server, that would truly suck
---
&gt;Anyone here planning to multibox? I can’t decide between a Shaman or Druid so I might play both.
---
This sounds like what you're considering is two-class dual boxing for levelling. If it's not, feel free to ignore me.
---
Playing two different classes at one time is rarely worth it as it'll stop you from fully controlling either one. While you'll finish kill quests slightly faster - you kill stuff in ~half the time but spend the same or more time running, and gain little when it comes to gathering quests - it won't help your grinding efficiency and getting a group for a quick instance... is unlikely to work out well, let's just put it that way. 
---
Doing so with one of them being a druid is arguably the *worst* choice as that class benefits tremendously from on-the-fly changes of playstyle while levelling, making matching it with any other class inherently inefficient. Doubling down on the hybrid choice only makes it worse. 
---
Having said that, it's a game so if this is what fun is to you I say go for it.
---
Yeah, Paladins definitely got shafted as far as tier sets go, except for [T2](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/small/73502.jpg) which is one of the best sets ever.
---
As for the ugliest, I'd actually go with the [Lightforge Armor](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/small/181474.jpg). That red/yellow combination looks like a McDonald's french fries container. (Or [Tier 5](http://i.imgur.com/qRybj.png) if we're talking TBC as well)
---
Another good reason to play Warlock: all their sets from Vanilla to WOTLK look badass (except maybe T4). Priests too actually, they tend to get [some of the most subtle and stylish ones](https://www.blogcdn.com/wow.joystiq.com/media/2007/08/priest_t1-6.jpg).
---
Rogue and lock looks awesome, the 2 classes ima level.
---
I was hoping to, but considering the horrendous state of melee leeway fundamentally changing how kiting works, plus a bunch of other things, I might not bother.
---
Is spell leeway even in the beta atm?
---
Layering is irrelevant to the amount of competition (more layers = more population, and that includes more hardcore players too...). The reason there won't be that much is because not *that* many players are that hardcore about levelling.
---
wrong... just becourse something is commonly viewed as trash does not mean it truly is but rather that it wasnt used in a manner for which it had potential, i have no interrest in teaching you of some examples as you are not worthy of knowing what you are unable to comprehend but let me say it like this.
---
there are abilities and items that have far more potential due to their mechanics than you would ever be able to fathom...
---
Really? MC and lvling for 6 months damn
---
I know you can do
---
/castsequence reset=[the cooldown of chain lightning] Chain Lightning, Lightning bolt, lightning bolt, lightning bolt 
---
And that 1 button let's you spam bolt while chain is on CD, but cast it as soon as it's back instead of a bolt.
---
Sure, but they dont get the silence/mana tap racial or the priest specific spells.
---
troll elsewhere
---
None. All you need is the quest text. Maybe you'll have to search a little now and then, but that way you learn your way around. After all those years I still remember ~ 90 % of them and the rest will come as I go.
---
If I was interested in following a waymarker and without knowing what's going on, I'd play retail.
---
Hi, /u/EragonOwlheart

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c88mjs/ive_mained_a_blood_dk_for_years_if_i_want_to_play/). 
---
hahaha
---
Imagine the turnover for an AH with 4 layers at 3k players each. Golden opportunities to snatch something cheap. I´m almost tempted not to level and just do daytrading for the entirety of phase 1.
---
But like 3 points in imp wingclip seems like it's really rolling the dice on getting a proc, not that far off just getting a parry for counterattack.
---
Seems weird to me that you just spam wingclip in melee by default, then counter attack is just like the backup plan if it never procs.
---
I remain unconvinced
---
It really wasn’t that long ago that we had server ques.
---
&gt;That 4chan leak seems more and more accurate the more time goes on.
---
Which one?
---
Why? I wasn't around back then. What is this about, if I may ask? I found a video on youtube, but I'm at work and can't watch it.
---
What is this 4chan leak?
---
Willwill will of the forsaken?
---
yeah and you just commented without reading any of it. That's okay though. This post isn't for you.
---
I see your point and agree that might become a reality. What I don't agree on is that people will support this decision. I think this would cause a massive, massive shitstorm.
---
T2,5? Isn't this the power ranger one, is it? Because I always found them so ugly they begin to be appealing in a *ridiculous* way
---
TIL I'm a Z-celeb.
---
Which concerns me. Because that means there's a video of me out there I wasn't aware was available to the publc...
---
I need to do some research on this.
---
That's not a strawman
---
I didn’t say that, I said they have been put in for the same purpose.
---
Please read it again.
---
Yeah that’s normal. They can’t rush it. A lot of people will need 2+ months to hit max level.
---
oh sorry, came off as kinda snarky
---
No balls.
---
I’m pretty sure you can use the second wand earlier than level 13?
---
That’s what ZG and AQ20 are for. Get a weapon off Hakkar or Ossirian and some other nice armor from the raids and you’re good to go.
---
Starting at around level 25 or 30 or so, good players will absolutely make sure they have mana potions on them at all times while leveling. It’s always cheaper to pop a potion than to die or wipe. They will always sell well on the AH. 
---
As for role in the economy, despite always selling well, not huge. They are a commodity. There’s a steady supply and steady demand. But there’s certainly profit to be made by alchemists and non casters who accrue then. 
---
If you’re asking about cornering the market...I wouldn’t try it. The rule of thumb is you need to pick something not easily or quickly replenished.
---
RemindMe! 18 hours
---
Yes, they had their models updated in 1.9 patch. One of my most vivid memories from Vanilla is logging in the day of the war effort and seeing all these people in their T2 sets hanging around Orgrimmar.
---
You can like classic gameplay and blood elf models at the same time.

I just started college, when WoW released. A friend talked me and naother into buying the game at EU release. I wasn't even that interested beforehand, but we started playing alliance. One of my friends switched to horde after a week and quit after 3 weeks. The one who talked us into buying the game quit two months in. I stayed and became a hardcore raider.
---
I absolutely loved the game in vanilla and in tbc. I took a month break here or there, but that's it. Then wrath came and I started to get disillusioned with the terrible heroics and the watered down naxx. Ulduar was great, but ToC brought it back to the dumpster again. That's where I quit the game, not just because of ToC, I still wanted to raid icecrown, but also because my guild broke apart.
---
Razer Naga Chroma, best friend of WoW player. 
---
I cant even play on keyboard binds anymore.
---
I mean skinning isn't a godsend for moneymaking but it's quick pocket money, takes nothing to level and gives fast returns.
---
In comparison leveling cooking is more of a thing for lvl 60s, the gold making element of cooking is tied to the right recipees and food which most players will NOT buy while leveling, even if vendoring what you craft is worth it, you'll have to specifically aim to farm cooking mats for specific crafts, this alone takes you out of your way to get.
---
Then let's talk about leveling cooking, you need to craft a lot of useless stuff that aren't worth much to get it up, this is also time wasted while leveling. 
---
Time investment in going to train and unlock recipes is also a time investment.
---
You must also build fire if no other fire is available, which has a very long cast time.
---
In comparison to all the above , skin time on mobs is trivial in comparison. 
---
People don't pick up skinning for the money value, it's value is mostly vendor trash which is mostly similar to looting a mob twice.
---
The reason you pick up skinning while leveling is because it's the least effort/time investment for getting extra cash, people who are rushing to 60 don't have time to go to main cities to train specific recipes and level up cooking to craft and then sell to make gold,the time it takes you to set up cooking and craft stuff is time wasted since you're literally cooking instead of killing mobs.
---
Whereas skinning you are leveling it while you kill, it's massively more time efficient and less effort. Bag space isn't an issue if you know how to manage it, I've leveled so many characters to 60 with skinning and I've never had issues with bags being full due to having too many skins lying around.
---
yeah no thanks
---
I prefer it the way it is where I can speak to my whole server in general and in trade and what not
---
not just my layer
---
no need to be snarky
---
I get your point indeed. But it’s that constant fear of the unknown that makes things interesting. Even farming materials has a bit of enjoyment behind it because you have to be watching your back while fishing or herbing. While yes it does lead to more downtime when farming sometimes because you die or whatever but that’s all part of the fun. And makes those farmed materials worth a little more on a pvp server in my opinion because some things will just be harder to farm because your in a high pvp area. If something is harder to farm for whatever the reason it will go up in value. So even farming mats it more worth it on pvp servers. Grinding mats would be so boring for me if I knew everything was going to be the same every time besides the occasional person getting in your way beating you to your farm spots. At least on a pvp server half the time I can take my frustration out on them because they are Opposite faction ;)
---
You’ll absolutely get that functionality from somewhere. Might not be the same addons though
---
The tick damage, or any damage coming from your dots.
---
Post proof then. I know for a fact they got changed in 1.9 because our tanks could not shut up about how cool the new T2 looked for a week after logging in once the War Effort started, which was patch 1.9.
---
It's even in the fucking patch notes.
---
I was 14 when I played vanilla, never did more than MC. played the entirety of vanilla from launch to TBC patch and never once did I feel like there wasn't to do, or felt left behind. Did I have the best gear? Absolutely not. Was I unable to duel and have fun and world PvP and BG? 100%!. I was full epic but only T1 or equiv and I still felt quite strong. You shouldn't really ever feel left behind because EVERYONE does every raid every week. You can PUG ZG/MC/AQ20/Possible BWL once they're on farm and perhaps even join a guild as a backup (which is what I did because I had school and couldn't raid late.) Non-serious guilds have no problem having 60-100 people online and just asking someone to come if a core raider cannot make it.
---
You needn't justify your server choice to this or any other community. 
---
I will however be playing on a PvP server. World PvP whether looking for it or trying to avoid it makes for a more interesting and challenging game.
---
WotLK was just average, you could have taken or left it.
---
There is a Late Game Beast Mastery talent setup that produces the most dps for hunters but its late game... Earlier on you are looking at Marks/MM in pve.
---
29 people dude? I don’t care what the circumstances are. You can’t act like it’s severely underpopulated.
---
&gt; i have no interrest in teaching you of some examples as you are not worthy of knowing what you are unable to comprehend but let me say it like this.
---
I’d say that proves his point. Can’t expect the geezer to do arithmetic.
---
It's the truth ? People who aren't rolling PvP it's because of the frustration of being gank. I dunno why i'm wrong here. If there is another reason, tell me please !
---
Alt-tabbing to a database works just fine, tried some of those addons but they turn me off - they clutter the map and make you feel like you're being herded. And considering the amounts of "why isn't Questie working for X"-messages you tend to see in General chat I doubt they'd be of much help.
---
Playing on a pve server removes 75% of the excitement of leveling.
---
Correction, he is.
---
We have a term for that. Carebear.
---
Dude. You're not supposed to look directly at a mod or acknowledge its existence.
---
You can love that t the sime time, but not play it.  
---
So no Classic en BE. no way on earth it will hapen.
---
Your petition will be down voted here this time, and every next time you post it here.
---
It's really not that bad as long as this isn't a regular thing.  No healthy person needs to be concerned about doing this on launch day.
---
No it wouldn't.
---
Why would you think that? I consider wPvP to be by a large margin the worst. I can love PvP and hate AoE clusterfucks where anything goes and the sides aren't even in number.
---
Hmmm, I'm not in agreeance. To me playing on a PvE server is like playing in creative mode on Minecraft. You choose when danger exists and progression is much easier because conflict is avoided. As a result, you loose that immersive feeling. O.k, you might have the gear faster and easier, but you miss out on creating that same bond with your character due to the tribulations you had to overcome.
---
I was in a decent raiding guild way back in vanilla and we occasionally picked up people who had low gear and helped them gear up for AQ when we were there. Unfortunately some people get geared from free MC/Ony/ZG etc and then leave anyway. But many stick around and it is well worth helping them out.
---
In terms of somebody being undergeared for the current raid, if they've been a raider for some time we'll do our best to help gear them. If people don't show up to MC/BWL and expect to be carried in AQ they got the axe.
---
That's not my guild roster mate, that is a overview of all alliance player online...
---
If you don't care what the circumstances are then there's no point in even having a discussion with you because you've made your mind up.
---
Damn buddy, that's rough. Enjoy launch my man, you deserved it!
---
That's what Hunters need most - Backup plans. Anything and everything. I could also be paranoid. 12% procs often enough, and I don't notice much of a diff between that and 20% honestly. 1 in 8 swings vs 1 in 5 swings, statistically speaking. Chance are you'll be stuck there anyways, and if not then you don't even need to care about WC anymore let alone IWC.
---
Worst case, you're missing out on 2-8% health. It's OK, but personally I like staying away and getting away much better.
---
Plus CounterAttack is only ONE point. Totally worth it. Also it cannot be avoided once used and can almost be used back to back. If a Rogue gets close enough, comes at you with evasion and ghost strike, good luck using WC. You WILL encounter rogues that do manage to sneak up on you, even as a hard counter to them. While spamming IWC, you should be ready to pop CA if it does come up. Relying on a parry isn't always ideal though, but the the higher the parry and soon sooner you can stop them, the better whether its WC or CA. Deterrence is a necessity IMO. That's your "OH SHIT" button. 
---
You do whatever you want bud. That was just a quick example build. I'm not saying it's top notch or the meta or that you have to use that build. Survival is partially preference aside from a few necessities for pvp.
---
All classes T3 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all other Tiers.
---
Reading comments there makes me wonder how common that really is. I have done 20+ 40 hour gaming sessions in my life and routing to this day will have 10 hour gaming days on the weekends when I don't have anything going on. I work in IT and spend 8 hours a day at my desk, and on days where shit hits the fan have skipped lunch. 
---
As someone who sits at least 70 hours a week due to hobbies, studying certifications, and work... am I cheating death? lol
---
Stay awesome friend : )
---
well there is a cool down on layer hopping now if you didn't get that memo 
---
but I do think people will still find a way to abuse it  
---
My hope is that layering doesn't last very long 
---
I would like blizz to put a hard cap on it for better or worse, like after two weeks its gone even if we end up with 10000 people on one server for a while
---
Wow, that sucks. Wrong faction and wrong server type.
---
Well at least you have hindsight to work with now.
---
I used one server for ally and another for horde. I may end up doing that again but I’m gonna try really hard to keep my alt-aholic tendencies in check. 
---
I mean, yeah....I need a bank alt/prof mule...and I guess I could level it up a little..maybe just high enough for a little pvp? If I do that, I may as well twink it out...but hrrrmmm...I’ll need to park him at the battlemaster, right? Argh...I better make a second bank alt, just in case...
---
Oh...you know what’s fun? Parking a horde rogue at red ridge and ganking leveling noobs...yeah...definitely need to do that...
---
And so it begins,..
---
What other people think of me is not my business.
---
I'll hit level 60 when I hit level 60. And hopefully I'll meet some gamers with the same mindset and pace on my way.
---
Yes, but trying to bring them to classic is not okay.
---
Can you start many instances of wow with the launcher, or do you need to do some shenanigans?
---
Ah gotcha, yeah didn't recognize the language.
---
That’s gonna be a no from me, dawg.
---
You've made points no else brought up before. Thank you.
---
Oh i know. I called him that in my post before that. Scan the rest of the thread and you can see his laughable response to what I was talking about with someone else.
---
You getting on the classic train too, eh Zelden?
---
Judgement is badass. I will say I am a fan of the paly armor before the change, but Judgement can’t be beat.
---
They won't get rid of phasing. They won't be able to if there are still 20k players on one server.
---
I don't know why you are getting downvoted.
---
A long bout like this is not going to impact anyone's health unless they make this type of play a regular thing or they were already unhealthy to begin with.
---
Voidwalker is more chill but slower than Imp. Staysafe has updated his guide and I fully trust his judgement considering how insanely much he played the beta as a lock.
---
They said it would last a couple weeks or a month.
---
It means some of the models were ready, but Blizzard likely chose to wait with releasing them until every set was finished.
---
T1 got updated in chunks, with some classes having half their sets with the new model and half their sets with the old model early on in MC. People didnt really like it.
---
Proof of old models in patch 1.8: [https://i.imgur.com/dMn6oOI.png](https://i.imgur.com/dMn6oOI.png)
---
some dude got fired from Blizz, then went on a bit of a rant about internal blizz employee environment on 4chan while simultaneously offering some juicy leaks abot upcoming stuff that may or may not be factual. Some of it seemed legit, kind of. It's difficult to for me to decide if it was just a troll or not based on the level of detail he went into on some subjects. Worth checking out but i wouldnt dwell on it for more than 10 minutes
---
Most of the time they just die to AoE. They don't have free AoE protection like current WoW.
---
You'll end up using a wolf most of the time to sit next to you for the Howl.
---
If phase 1 lasts for 4 months that's only 12 MC clears for guilds that can field 40 in 1 month, if it takes a guild 2 months that's only 8 clears.
---
All this clambering for faster phases is so misguided. You need to gear a core of 20-25 players and a semi core of 10-15 and hopefully get at least one of your tanks TF. Your guild will see too much of some class gear and too little of some others and will tourists in that semi core tier will disappear as fast as you hand them gear. Only the most hardcore and well organized guilds will get bored - and even then assuming they are lucky enough to get a TF or 2 in the works - otherwise they'll be hitting MC as frantically as everyone else.
---
Thanks for this.  
---
Strange that nobody already brought this up....
---
With the internal cooldown, it can still be "abused" but very very inefficiently. Not worth it.
---
If Blizz sticks to 1-2 weeks, it'll be pretty good. 3 weeks.. eehh questionable. Longer than that, problematic for sure. I just hope the Merge goes well and the queue times don't come back to haunt.
---
Cloth set looks like your head is a birthday cake with candles. What were they thinking?
---
I sat in a queue last night for league of legends.
---
thats good to hear
---
People forget that Classic is just a minor fanservice while the modern game with expansions is their flagship. Come on.
---
I’d probably stick with 5/5 shadow focus even on pvp. You’re going to be favored as a spriest in almost every single fight already. But if you wanted to go 3/5 and come back to add the last two that’d be interesting. 
---
The reason I say 5/5 is because it’ll make such a significant difference if you’re fighting mobs a few levels above you. They’ll literally be the strongest talents in your entire build outside of abilities like MF and SF. Whereas the 4% stun is going to be worth dead zero on most fights.
---
Actually Red Dragon Perdition! Fits my hand more comfortably lol.
---
Should be the same in english. Huntress and Huntard.
---
I'm fine with you or anyone else finding that interesting but I definitely dont.
---
The value thing you're talking about can lead to entire servers being crippled, that's what happened with the devilsaur mafia on a certain pserver. You might find that fun too, which is fine. I certainly don't.
---
I think you are purposely misleading.
---
is there any actual source on the layering cooldown other than some random twitter post?
---
Since everyone remember it being there it's on you to provide proof that it wasn't.
---
no they are not
---
all we know so far is that the servers will be up two weeks before launch for character creation 
---
Im hoping they will give us a list at least a little before that
---
That was well written then! respect
---
Would you like to see my logs?
---
Yep. I don’t think the abuse will go too far if it’s really only a two week process. So in that instance, there really isn’t too much to abuse that will break the game in the long term. But if we have layers for 1-3 months, then people who get to 60 first have an empty world of layers to exploit.
---
Well for the first almost year end will be those raids
---
I wish.
---
you can do it as soon as u get the quest at 5, just aggro swap with ur imp and kite him to the guards at the tower up north
---
Fahrenheit I know.  The three original reference points - 0, 32, 96 - were all set to be even numbers in base 2 (binary).
---
If I recall correctly there will be five EU servers. Two PvP, two PvE and one RP (PvE). Server names have not been released yet.
---
I have a shitload of student loan debt and no degree after spending 4.5 years at school and being put on academic suspension. Didn't go to class all that much the last 2 years with WoW lol.
---
I think about this every single time I play a game online now, no matter what it is. I am "only" 35.
---
Kids seem the same to me more or less. Not worse or better. 12 year olds still using swear words and people in their early 20's still think they know better. Same pattern.
---
No, prot warrior
---
the beta is not a source?
---
I need footage from Vanilla. Classic beta footage isn’t good enough I’m afraid. I have footage from a mage called Faxmonkey who show cases mages ridiculous kiting ability with mobs almost on top of him and they still can’t land a hit. 
---
This is ACTUAL vanilla footage: https://youtu.be/5frS6BjaiD8?t=121
---
Compare it to this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Z8MTAX-nQ&amp;t=
---
We can clearly see how the beta is a lot different to vanilla in regards to Melee hits from mobs.
---
Yeah I'm not sure why people are asking for a source on this considering it's a beta... if they were to make a blue post on every single change they did in beta they wouldn't have time to make actual changes.
---
For instance, they took out right click reporting but havne't said a word about it.  Does that mean that right click reporting is going to be in the game?  No, of course not... things like this don't just get removed accidentally.
---
This post seems to be getting enough traction to keep me motivated on it for now, gathering info on other classes right now. Do me a solid and post important info I should include for class specific things! Thanks guys.
---
oh thank god I thought you were crazy for a bit lol
---
Where’s it out you, thelsamar?
---
There’s just as many people claiming it wasn’t as much as there as people saying it was. Why should we take anyone’s word for it?  I have actually provided some proof if you check one of my replies to one of the comments in this thread.
---
No lmao
---
Does it matter if they announced it or not?  Serious question, this is a beta they are constantly changing things... there is no longer right click reporting in the beta, do they need to make an announcement to convince you it's gone or can you not just see it for yourself.
---
Numerous things changes with each patch however Blizzard are giving us the 1.12 version of the game with only content being held back. So to reference any changes that happen before 1.12 are irrelevant, understand. 
---
Pointing out things that have changed after that(and there are plenty) are more than fair.
---
How about playing the game as intended, without roadmaps, GPS markets, sparkles on quest items and highlighted areas?
---
Give it a shot for 10-15 levels at least?
---
tfw no draenei
---
Sounds like a perfect fit philosophically for me. Unfortunately I can only raid Su-Th. I’ll save this in case my work schedule changes.
---
Also I'll make the rest landscape instead of portrait, apparently you guys don't how great it is redditing on a portrait screen. =D
---
There is very little in common between classic and retail gameplay beyond what amounts to cosmetic flourishes. 
---
I very recently messed around with a few new toons just to try on a few race/class combos for classic and wow...they’ve really changed up spellbooks. Warrior starts with one button. I think I made it to level 3 and still only had 1 button. I understand what they’re doing and why, but it is a very stark difference in approach between the two games. 
---
Retail feels a lot like it’s being shoehorned in to a mobile platform with 3 or 4 buttons. Classic is not at all like that, especially if you go shaman,
---
Five!? That sounds crazy. I hope they're not overestimating their capacity, or underestimating the population at launch for that matter.
---
I know its as if the beta is unofficial or to some or something lol 
---
at any rate im glad they did something
---
Nope sorry, you're wrong.
---
I don't believe it was a bug. Not sure on the reasoning.
---
"Show me evidence" "but not the most credible evidence that is pvp videos." Nobody was really recording pve in vanilla and 240p was the standard for videos then so. That is your evidence.
---
So that's where all the healers are....
---
I haven't made the wand progression myself, but the guide is mostly made from the DPS of the Wand and some of the other stats. So that might be correct 
---
The PRE-RAID-BIS wand is the bonecreeper stylus from scholo.

It seems like ~70% of multiboxers might play alliance.
---
You can. You can even choose which instance should ge on which screen
---
Something sick.
---
Probably 400ish days.
---
I agree. I’m not interested in getting ganked and camped until I’m forced to log by bored max level players. I’m here to enjoy the story, the dungeons and raids. I’m personally going to roll on the roleplay realm because roleplayers add far more to game atmosphere than being spawn killed over and over by an orc rogue named “Fkurmum” ever will. But that’s my perspective.
---
Leeway was added after all classes with deadzones had deadzone removed. The first class to have deadzones removed was Hunter in 2.3
---
That was easy. Anything else I can Google for you?
---
Perhaps it requires a Sub to get in beta(altho I think that window has closed now), I can confirm that is does not require a sub to play beta.
---
Source; my sub ran out after a month and I can still play beta without a sub.
---
Did we really need this thread to be made?
---
Inb4 dId Ur coMMent rly NEED 2 b made
---
&gt;There's no other Alliance race for hunter though :/
---
.
---
&gt;Dwarf is pretty cool but
---
Hmmm
---
Think it depends on a few other factors as well. When I was 15 and playing vanilla with all the time in the world, sure, pvp server all the way.
---
Now with a full time job and a plethora of other responsibilities, I don't have time to get camped until I log out. It sucks but I'll take the hit of not being able to world pvp if that means I can do the things I want without interference.
---
Wait.
---
...
---
.....
---
What's layering?
---
The patchnotes were on a wiki. Totally wrong. 100% the new models were released when I had first arrived in Gadgetzan(I remember because I was a paladin and thought the set was super dope). I was 60 before Aq40 came out.
---
I think that’s the point of layering right?
---
They don’t want to have like 20 servers and then when people leave, you’ll have nearly empty servers and then they will be forced to combine them.
---
gameplay changes are one thing, small QoL things like switching characters around on the login screen were never part of the NoChanges discussion. those things don't affect how the game plays and nobody has an issue with them.
---
it doesn’t matter to me but people(including the person I replied to) have said that blizzard has announced it so I was just asking for source
---
No
---
Aside from this being completely made up, five is a staggeringly low guess.
---
Nobody cares.
---
LOL. Who's gonna spend time on a temporary character that's capped at lvl40. Let people play 8.2 for a few weeks and get back to the beta afterwards.
---
There won’t be much light leather on the ah, that’s for sure. Beyond this, a lot of people will go in to the game using a cookie cutter spec and level as quickly as possible to face bosses that were world firsted 15 years ago and thereby missing the whole point of the game?
---
Each one will be layered into oblivion, don't worry.
---
I totally forgot these went through a refresh.  The old placeholder stuff was so sad looking in comparison.
---
It's still a minute amount of mana regen unless you're wearing spirit gear and good luck surviving STV or even Ashenvale in that kind of gear. 
---
The mana you get btw is your spirit - 23. So if you have 100 spirit which is already quite a lot you only get 77 mana. It's something, but I'd rather either go into demo for more wPvP talents or go with a drain tank build, possibly the succubus dark pact build.

Nefarian kill on September 27, 2005 with OLD T2: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ1OUeG1poE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ1OUeG1poE)  
---
(You can see the tank shoulders or helmet, or at the end photo druid shoulders are old T2, and much more)  
---
AQ patch (1.9) was released on January 3, 2006
---
By definition WoW is a casual game; it was designed to be able to be played casually by anyone, unless you're planning on doing the grand marshal/high warlord grind. Pretty sure the guy can manage to do endgame raids with 10 hours a week available to him. Might not be able to go all the way through AQ 40 (just by the sheer size of the raid and all of its trash mobs) or maybe Naxx but that's so far into the future it surprises me that people on the sub talk like they're fast approaching. Definitely could manage doing BWL at the very least, no problem, especially if he's willing and wants to tank; people will invite him to do shit left and right (assuming he's a decent tank/person).
---
Two weeks before is workable, thanks
---
It all really depends on your groups gear, preparedness, knowledge and level of play. If the raid leader is clear and consice with  explaining and calling out mechanics for people, and the people in the raid are paying attention, it goes way faster. Handing out gear is the really big time eater. If the raid grinds to a halt to decide who gets what that's where it really falls apart in terms of clear speed.
---
I've seen 1 hour speed runs of ZG and Molten Core with groups in pre-raid bis and T1 mix. I've seen 3 hour Molten Cores that fell apart before downing Rag. But once people start getting T2 and AQ40 gear, you'll start seeing bigger guilds doing ZG and MC in half an hour to gear Alts.
---
Have cross realm bg’s been confirmed?
---
I’m sure it’s in the beta I was just asking for the source on it when you claim that blizzard announced it.
---
There is always craigslist
---
No BGs in phase one.
---
Wouldn't that be "FingD" insetad of FDing?
---
No. Classic is using the 1.12 mount system.
---
Whats the flight time difference between Orgrimmar-Tanaris and Orgrimmar-Everlook?
---
What software did you use to make it?
---
Most retail icons I gotta look at it for like 3 min before I can understand what the icon is showing.
---
Condescending? Not at all. I already know the vast majority of players wont make it to 60 at all. All im saying is a hear people go on and on about endgame and raiding, when for most people the game is levelling. Only a tiny minority will raid at all, thats why my advice for every player is to just relax and see what happens. If you get to 60, possibly a year from now, you can see if you find some nice players to raid with. If you rush to 60, you'll likely meet likeminded people along the way.   
---
Most things in vanilla happen organically. In vanilla and every pserver ive tried since I have met people along the way to 60 and made a guild with them. Just play the game like you would with no prior knowledge and let it happens my friend, it will all work out.
---
I used to main warrior, and I was pretty decent.
---
Who are you? With your assumption we can go with: 'Sounds like you are bad at ranged classes.' person.
---
The OP is a hunter who wants melee range nerfed so that he can kite easier... that much is clear. Meh
---
For mine it was Photoshop
---
Your source is that it is currently on in the beta.  Blizzard isn't going to make an announcement on something that they might not have solidified on the details yet.  Maybe it has a 10 min cooldown right now but they might make it less or more, they might not ever announce something like this.  All you need to know is that it is present.
---
I split half my spells on the naga and the other half on keyboard. Depends what form I’m in. Healsand shaleshifts are for the mouse. Melee and ranged on the keyboard. 
---
It’s all dependent on how it feels.
---
Just bend over and take it. I swear i'll stop in 2 weeks.
---
T0 is okay.
---
The reel from the fish boss. It gives you 10% spell hit for 15 seconds or so and is used on tank swap fights, particularly 4H where repeated taunt misses can be fatal.
---
Why is there always so much salt in these threads? Does it really offend the PvPers that much that some people enjoy to play the game in a different way? Do you go on PvE servers and spam trade chat with "ur all playing the game wrong stop having fun1!!!!"?
---
Lmfao nice anecdote
---
Spell casters for example. The only stat boosting their spells is the +spell damage. 
---
Intelligence increases your mana pool and crit chance so it's still important, but it's not like warriors who depends on their Strength and weapon damage.
---
I would take that post with a huge grain of salt. Seemed way more likely that someone read what we can all reasonably assume (low internal morale at Blizz after the layoffs and bad press) and started writing their own fanfic. Seemed to be written almost entirely to cater to the outraged gamer crowd  
---
Suppose we'll see at blizzcon, but I find it really doubtful.

wrong, new T2 sets were in 1.6
---
If that is your plan, I strongly recommend you make a Mage on the second account to compliment your Shaman. Free ports &amp; water ontop of gathering professions. 
---
Can always take it one step farther and make it an enchanter. That way you can enchant your own stuff.
---
Sure you can, there will be plenty of raid guilds that don't focus on fast progress. Have fun!
---
Why would you not??
---
So this is a safe space thread to shield people from all the anti pve server threads? I have yet so see 1 anti pve server thread and i've been browsing this thread daily for the past few months.

Your just creating an agrument for the sake of argument.

I'm going to use the opportunity to level an alt if it becomes a camping/griefing. But I do feel ya about being a grown up and trying to play this game. fortunately i can probably get a few hours after 10pm

These are the 200 IQ plays that set the real elite gamers apart.
---
I'm rolling PvE cause quite frankly for 5ish years my only options for vanilla were over crowded PvP servers full of spergs and toxic gankers. Actual quality PvP was minimal, ganking, camping, and griefing was everywhere. I put my time in fighting insurgents all through STVietnam, this time it's just going to be a mysterious jungle full of animals and quests.  
---
             
---
I've rolled on a PvP server since the day I started wow, but this old warhorse is going to out to pasture. I'm gonna enjoy my days of leveling in peace and emoting to those disgusting alliance pigs.
---
You kind of need to keep running old raids for a while, so it's not really too hard to gear up new people.  MC is run forever due to thunderfury.  BWL may also be run for a while to collect elementium for AQ40 weapons and some of the stronger gear like neltharion's tear and DFT.  It may be a bit more challenging if you're a new-ish 60 that a naxx guild is trying to pick up.  I'd imagine with some luck you could find yourself in a near full set of BWL gear in a week or two, though, since you'll just be defaulted pretty much all of it.
---
More hardcore guilds are more likely to have alts as well, so including a weaker new recruit in a run with a bunch of alts would probably gear them up quite fast.
---
Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it unless you want to be pretty hardcore.  Hitting 60 around AQ release will mean you're not going to be raiding naxx when it's released, most likely.  However, most middle of the pack guilds will probably pick up new players along the way due to attrition or just because they like raiding with cool people they meet.
---
I think it's more of an obsidian edged blade tbf

I think discord can easily solve your cross faction advertising as easily as making an alt to spam trade.

i would never siphon life in a rotation it's a waste of mana
---
Wand progression is pretty pointless for a mage.
---
Getting the Lesser Magic Wand at level 5 is absolutely amazing, and the Greater Magic Wand at lvl 13 is still very useful. Beyond that you're really not going to be using a wand very much, unless the mob happens to be at 1-3% HP so you can regen some mana.
---
you have good friends
---
I've played two unnamed servers that won't be named, and both had insane amount of ganking in STV, neither of them were a problem as long as it's no more than 2 players attacking you, and max a few levels over you (resists fuck you over in 2v1 scenarios). Fear, void sack and soulstones are insanely broken, as you'll be able to kill players before they even break your voidwalker shield, let alone healthstones. 42 gives you Death Coil as well, which turns you in to a 1v1 mass murderer.
---
Warlocks are by far the best low geared / leveling pvp specs, it's not until you hit 60 and fight players using pots and shadow reflectors that they start to encounter any resistance in 1v1s.
---
As always, pvp servers is about not giving them an opportunity, if you stay high on mana and health, you'll soon realize that very few players attack you, and even less attack you more than once, as you'll absolutely slaughter them if you play right.
---
Wrong. Casual guilds can do just fine in most raids. You don't need to be in a hardcore progression guild to complete raiding content.
---
Read this very carefully my friend just so you aren't confused anymore.  I am telling you, that there was no announcement.  I am saying that the guy may have been wrong about the announcement.  I am just saying, that there doesn't need to be an announcement on something like this, and that an announcement is quite irrelevant.  
---
So I am answering your question, and then more by letting you know it's irrelevant.  Do you understand what I am telling you now.
---
I do get strong IKEA vibes, reading that...
---
I hope you will get really excited when it takes 4 hours to kill 3 mobs in SVT. Hope you will post about how much fun you had corpse running 8 times in an hour.
---
They never said that.
---
I wish I could get it to only display quests that I have instead of every quest available in the zone
---
Gaming corporate destroyed the whole industry. Remember westwood studios? I bet thats how Blizzard worked back in the days too. Out of pure joy and hoping to deliver a great product with lesser means and no stupid corporate greed.
---
For wand at 60, dps doesnt matter, you want one with +sp
---
Good try. Go and sign for America got talent. Thanks.

Is that not still the case or do you just stand up?

Ah, you must be thinking of the bookshelf, it do have a similar name

Err, server merges in vanilla? I never heard about this. My server was pretty low pop and it was never merged with anything. They just kept opening new servers and provided free transfers there from high pop servers. But actual server merges? I didn't think, they did any merging until they made connected realms in 2014 or so. I also can't find any documentation of any server merges. 
---
It also makes little sense to merge servers, when the game is growing, which it definetely was back then, merging is something you do to compensate for player loss.
---
Yeah, I usually just catch the highlights on youtube after, too. I imagine after how poorly last blizzcon went, Blizzard is probably sweating bullets on this one. Not sure what they can have under wraps, hope its more than just a standard WoW expansion and Overwatch PvE
---
But if you suggest that they invite more people, you're an entitled loser who should go back to BfA and uninstall your computer.
---
15 hours a week is tons of time. Especially if a chunk of that is on Saturday for example. Could easily pug a raid

---
All in 2005. 
---
Patch 1.9 came out in 2006...
---
&gt;  Then you prolong the beta beyond what is necessary
---
You're joking, right ? We haven't even seen content past 50. Last week the narrative was that hunters are literally unplayable. Somebody posted a bug about mage shields today. And of course the dumpster fire that has been layering.
---
You are literally just wrong.
---
I wouldn't call the armed forces a game but yes you did have to be old enough to play.
---
Does he need anything from this boss? 
---
Devout shoulders. He'll have more mana. Help him heal better.
---
Oh christ

just speaking from experance, it ends up feeling like LFR

5 other guys are not even guild members

---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSd6-EvBgN4
---
The logic was that the Hunter slowed their heart rate so much so that they appeared dead, but if they kept up the charade for too long they'd actually die.
---
That's true but more stats is always good, the DM wand is 4 MP5 which comes in handy, some of the other wands giva stamina or resistances.
---
Wand progression shouldn't be a priority but can be a good side quest to do if you don't have anything else to do
---
Casters? Green +(insert your type of magic dmg) gear can make you wreck face. But you run out of mana pretty quick
---
There wasnt leeway in the same way that the classic beta have it right now.  
---
Leeway back in vanilla was a mechanic that allowed melee attacks to go off up to about 0,2\~ sec after the target had moved out of your melee range, thus giving you a bit of leeway to account for the time it took to communicate with servers.   
---
the way "leeway" works on the classic beta is  that it simply increases your characters melee range whenever you and your target is moving, thus giving you an extra exploitable advantage that you yourself can basically turn on and off by simply moving.
---
The point of phase 1 is to get as many people as possible into MC before trivializing it with the release of DM which is a catch-up dungeon. Phase 1 will last 2-3 months or longer guaranteed. And layering will be there for most of it.
---
This meme is right to assume that the retail player does not respond to the vanilla player
---
How does world bosses work on Pve servers? Must be very boring if you cant wipe another raid on the opposite faction that are trying to kill a world boss..
---
Personally I've never been worried about the fact that I'm a Wrath Baby. I wanna play Vanilla specifically *because* I missed it the first go around.
---
I dunno about *every* single set, but Legion did have some really good tiers.  ToS and NH in particular had some really good looking armor
---
From what I’ve noticed this entire sub is just salty about everything that isn’t salt itself. Everyone seems so eager to be negative that it’s actually becoming creepy.

\&gt;This is ACTUAL vanilla footage: [https://youtu.be/5frS6BjaiD8?t=121](https://youtu.be/5frS6BjaiD8?t=121)
---
I mean, you can't prove or disprove Leeway \*if the creature you're kiting isn't even swinging at you\*. The unique molten giant doesn't count as it literally didn't even swing. Same for the demon. Each mob he kited, seems to be very delayed on attempting to swing or never swung while in range until they're in a certain position. Leeway also, I think, only applies when a swing is ABOUT to go off and someone goes just outside of your range. What I see here, is him being hit or swung at(a lot of misses) and otherwise several swings where he's just exiting the melee zone and being hit from pretty far away(confirming leeway against the two stone giants on several occasions); Lastly, god that music was terrible. Nice kiting skills though. From what I can see in the beta video, the mobs attack much sooner, attack on the fly instead of trying to run and stop to attack, and still land a hit as the Gnome exits that normal melee range. I mean you just proved Leeway was there but trying to prove it wasn't. Those videos were actually good comparisons for PVE. PVP... unsure. For the Melee Extension, it's clearly there in Classic but I don't think I see it in Vanilla. For the Leeway, it's clearly in both but may or may not be somewhat extended in Classic. Comparing those NPCs in Classic to Vanilla however, it seems they're a bit more aggressive and quick acting in Classic. Legion Engine right?
---
Also, between a Troll and Gnome, it can skew perception considering the size differences to the eye. Those are good comparisons for sure though. I hope they get rid of both the Extension and Leeway regardless. I'm not a fan of either.
---
One of the best runs I ever did was after out tank rage quit very early on over something trivial. It'd taken so bloody long to get there that we carried on without a tank. Our hunter tanked way better than the actual tank, our healer was boss, and the DPS were good and also smart.
---
I'll never see its like again.
---
Yes, I also did not see any announcement which is why I asked him for a source since he claimed they announced it.
---
YEah it sucked. Only did it because my work friends did. To make it worse, we were Alliance.
---
[Icefury Wand](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7514) is still better.
---
The problem is that nobody remembers it being like this.
---
Bear druids are fine off tanks
---
Looks great! I also saw the warlock one you referenced and was wondering what it'd look like for other classes. Good job!
---
I love how all these «I don’t wanna be bullied and ganked»-stories are from Alliance perspectives. 
---
The bitches of Azeroth, everyone.
---
I got some bad news for you...you should probably double check your credit card statements.
---
Your guessing while i'm recounting history for you.
---
We (the majority) already left Blizzard once. We will do it again if they keep fucking around.
---
You just keep telling us "you think you do but you don't." That doesn't work out well for WoWs profits does it?
---
Super easy to get 60s reinforcements from SW though.  Perfect for getting some big fights going, gank a few lowbies to bait out the 60s, then have all your friends come out of the shadows.
---
Literally any set of patch notes, my friend. I could just link you to a Google search but there's pages and pages of resources you could click on. Not sure which one suits your fancy so off you go to learn how to do something on your own!

Pretty much the same feeling that you would get if a low level of the same faction did it?
---
We had a poll recently in the Hungarian community. Hungarian players tend to like PVP and the "unofficial hungarian" server during retail vanilla was a PVP one (EU Bloodscalp).
---
Out of 1173 responses only 575 players (49%) wants to play on PVP.
---
Yet, here in this subreddit it feels like 90% of the playerbase wants to be on a PVP realm and everyone bitches about the missing RP-PVP (Sure there could be at least one, but I'm pretty sure most of the whining players never played on a real RP server, and will never play real RP even if Blizz launches one). Stop this utter bullshit folks, PVE players do exist in large numbers, don't try to make it look like this game is only enjoyable on a PVP server.
---
Only killing one mob at a time? That's not Warlocking.
---
Anyone stupid enough to 1v1 a similar leveled warlock is gonna have a bad time. Most people know to stay away from them. This also means that when they have the advantage of being in a group or much higher level they will 100% try to gank you. Especially if you're a gnome or undead. Having the demo talents means you can actually win 1v2s and even 1v3s if you're good enough, or fend off a much higher leveled ganker. I love when a big burly warrior comes charging at me thinking I'm an easy pick because he's 10 levels above me, and I still beat him because the double shield is just so strong.
---
Make sure you check what the unofficial language servers are going to be!
---
I think it's... Layering will end after population balance out.
---
Very useful information, thanks for sharing your opinion with us.
---
Im a war main and i absolutely hate leeway its gonna feel so awkward and also give Casters and hunter a huge disadvantage
---
I've debated back and forth on what server type to play on.  I'd really like to play a PvP server this time around after having WM (Alliance) on for most of BfA, but I just don't have the hours to play that I used to. There's too much downtime involved on a PvP server to get everything else done that I want to with the limited play time.
---
I was linked this post from a friend of mine who knows I play Star Citizen, and keeps trying to convince me to play WoW classic. 
---
AMA.
---
Exactly. I always loved just the fact that if I see wPVP going on, I don't feel sucked into it. Sometimes I need to get up and go move laundry from the washer to the dryer, and it's frustrating coming back to a corpse walk, too.
---
You are correct! That is a great wand, will update it in the next version!
---
You can kite hogger to the guards further up, usually I go for the ones near the bridge at the river. Wait for hogger to patrol close enough so you can cast rank 1 frost bolts and aggro him towards river then work your way upwards until you’re in bridge range and the guards will aggro. 
---
This could potentially work with other classes but as a mage you can frost bolt and if Hogger resists you spam sheep before he gets too close. Polymorph is perfect to regain range and if necessary regen mana. Then continue kiting him up the river until you’re at the bridge and keep kiting until guards aggro and take over.
---
Just a little tip for anyone with a ranged class trying to solo hogger, if you kite him across the east river, there is an L shaped fence on a farm that you can jump over constantly and he will take the whole path around the fence.
---
You need to define leeway or this post won’t be helpful. There are different kinds of “leeway” and everyone has different understandings and definitions.
---
Tbh i haven't tried it in years.  Might do that later today.

I, along with many in my guild, have very limited play time.  I need to make the most of that time so PvE is the obvious choice for me.  It would be extremely frustrating to have a 2 hour window after 3 days of no play time and spend the entirety of it getting camped.  I played PvP for the entirety of my WoW history so I’ve experienced it.  Now, my lifestyle requires the most casual option available.  Do what you want, have fun.
---
Is it not worth it to get cookies stirring rod?
---
This is one of the reasons i'm thinking i'll roll pvp server for the first time.  But... i'm also probably not going to hit 60 until phase 2 anyways, lol.
---
I'll probably still go pvp unless IRL friends decide to play and go pve.  I was never terribly good at pvp but BGs are super fun to me so frankly I could use the practice of the wPVP while I level.   I keep trying to hop on a i60 pserver every now and then or something but it's pretty overwhelming to try playing some of these classes with a shit ton of skills (like warrior or druid having to shift stances/forms) when you've never played them and are playing against people that have been playing for years and are decked out in T3/R14, lol.  Makes you really feel like a wasted spot!
---
complaining is what you are doing lol
---
about a temporary system no less
---
Well it's pretty easy to make them if you Google some guides for the class and sort through the information
---
Yep, game is too easy and has no real challenges outside of the sweet, sweet PvP
---
Meanwhile the warrior rolled night elf and raided with gauntlets that made him immune to disarm, implying MS as well. I'd take the paladin over that warrior tbh.
---
I guess you could say that kill was....
---
Next level.
---
No, the game is dungeons and raids.
---
See how it works both ways?
---
Many of these don't stack and most are still used by a normal melee dpser.
---
funny, i plan on killing lowbie hunter's pets. and only their pets. over and over.
---
I stand with leeway! Power to the melee!
---
Because they can and blizzard allows it. Just because you and I(and most players) don’t see the fun in it doesn’t mean it’s not somebody’s idea of fun.
---
not really people do things they enjoy, if they didn't enjoy it they probably wouldn't do it 
---
no need to over think it
---
You’re 100% right.
---
A loot council with a merit based system is honestly the best route.
---
i.e. if an arms warrior is busting his ass every raid getting full consumes and is just after certain pieces focused on pvp, then by all means give that guy the items when available within restrictions of "fair" loot distribution and round robin'ing. If your MT and OT that show up every day both have thunder fury, maybe then you can open up merit based on which rogue or fury warrior could benefit the most from getting your (*cough* unlikely *cough*) third thunder fury bindings.
---
DKP seems to always benefit those "rarer" classes like druids or back when vanilla-era warlocks that you'd only have 1-2 MAX per raid.  It always turned into "do we charge them negative DKP and just give them the gear anyway?" compared to warriors, rogues and mages always trying to outbid each other on gear.  It was incredibly gear lopsided and often your 4th line mage or rogue would be barely getting scraps until you have a raid on farm.
---
I personally will be implementing a Loot Council with only certain restrictions that benefit the raid (enhance with blacksmithing get prio on hand of rag if they heal raids, tfury goes to MT first).
---
If you show up, pull your weight, you got to the front of the line in terms of who gets the next &lt;class&gt; item or "wishlist" drop.
---
You're getting downvoted, but I agree that TBC had some good sets.  They also had some bad sets.  But there were still some good vanilla designs with T2.  Tier 2.5 was a bit fugly, I didn't mind being a gnome.  They had a more "power rangers" look to them.
---
Naxx sets were pretty awesome looking.  Was a bummer we didn't get to really see them that long.
---
I don't remember the wrath sets really too much, only played the re-hash of naxx.  But, at least for my rogue in TBC, I loved the Deathdealer's helm.
---
right, right. I forgot the internet meta
---
No it hasn’t all it has proven is people love hyperbole when arguing against it.
---
Oh no doubt. I have no interest in making them; just wondered what they might look like. :P
---
It is not temporary you gullible fool. It makes no business sense to get rid of it after developing it for this long.
---
You guys are going to fuck up wow for a 2nd time and I'm going to be laughing my ass off from the sidelines.
---
Take my upvote for this glorious meme content.
---
That is why I am asking. I want to see their perspective cause maybe I want to try.
---
This version appears to be the same resolution after downloading both
---
Except for the ICD that’s been added.
---
I mean most topics that pop up, whether they be meme or otherwise have been argued to death either here or over the 14 years since the game has been out :)
---
Not much new content my guy. Just stirring up stuff, love to hear fresh voices in a debate or topic.
---
DPSenvy much? :@P
---
Well now you are just making things up ...
---
I'll wish you a good day sir
---
Sorry you're so angry
---
We can't even see what it fixes yet. And they tested layering on a group way to small ( beta audience) so it is a false reprecentation about what it really is.
---
But stuff like mining note abusing or dodging world pvp should be made harder and I think they did make it harder. I have no beta.
---
twinking occurs when people can afford high quality gear, and is usually done on alts. I don't expect it to be a thing right off the bat...
---
I use a lap pool every morning.
---
To ban them forever you mean?
---
Well I can still go kill those mobs as a Horde mage. It appears some of those wands are quest rewards. They may be Alliance only quests.
---
So are you gate keeping against people who played vanilla when it came out then?
---
There is no proof that these video were really done in 2005, i think even if they killed the boss in 255, the video was done later than that. Don't you think ?
---
How could you explain that both World FIRST Drama and EU first Nihilum have old tier2 while killing Nefarian for the first time ?
---
https://youtu.be/yJ1OUeG1poE?t=45
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkYGV0AlIx8
---
Me too, that's a good idea. I'm stealing that after I'm done poopsock leveling w/ BiS class for that particular task.
---
I loved that mouse, if you're like my I upgraded to G600 and couldn't go back for anything now
---
Can you give me details please :o ?
---
You won't get much out of posting that stuff here. Go annoy blizzard until you get an answer from them.
---
&gt;people suddenly have access to 5 or 7 or however many layers
---
They will have as many layers as needed at the time to prevent players &lt;10 from clogging the starting zones. After the first week there will be less layers, and after a couple weeks there should be enough distribution across different levels that layering will not be needed. So we are literally talking about hardcore levelers who will reach 55+ in less than a week of real time.
---
It is not an argument. We are stating a fact. It is a bad system that will drive many people away. More people will leave because of layering than because of queues. 
---
History already proved this. WoW grew while it had queues. They added sharding and then it started dieing rapidly.
---
Right click report isn’t in any of their tests. So it’s very possible it will be in classic and just isn’t in beta cause it’s a test and they don’t assign GM’s to support test realms.
---
I have changefd the WAnd progression in the new version so all the quest reward Wands are removed from the list.
---
I mean if you refuse to subject yourself to reason, that's fine, but I'm not going to try and sit here and reason with an idiot.
---
I slowed down the video and can clearly see misses, absorbs, or hits as he's leaving the melee reach of those creatures. Yes I say "it doesn't count" to the first two encounters, because those creatures NEVER SWUNG. That means there is something just wrong with those NPCs, and without actually attacking, it doesn't prove or disprove Extension or Leeway. It's worthless. Your retort makes no sense, and lacks detail to what I just stated above - The last fight the Mage had with the two stone golems, was a very good perspective of leeway existing. You just proved it, and are now in denial. Good luck and hopefully you don't get too many downvotes.
---
I would be fine with them adding their zones in to fill out the map but I do not think they should be playable.
---
the chance might actually be bigger. because he meets them at a certain time slot because thats the time he can play, and the other 10-hour-gamer is free on those same timeslots etc
---
Any thoughts on how to counteract the first problem?
---
I agree with your second thought on making sure the few core people you KNOW will be there week in and week out is a solid strategy. I've seen some guilds do minimum dkp hits for specific tanks (MT,OT) to ensure they are geared quickly for content progress.
---
What about your thoughts on how DKP should be handled when dealing with Off-spec, or pvp items?
---
I really don't know what to believe. People have proof for either variant. But I did raid BWL since 1.6, I clearly remember our first raid the day after patch 1.6 hit, where we killed razorgore and then wiped 3 hours on vael. 
---
I also remember t2 looking like its final form when bwl hit. I remember being amazed at the new t2 helmet and legs, which I was wearing. I had t2 finished by 1.8 or so and I'm very certain it didn't look like a blue plate armor set. And the same for the other people in the raid. I think, I would remember, if we all looked like lvl 50s on the first nefarian kill.
---
Played as a prot warrior and MT for all of vanilla, tbc and first month of LK. They dumbed it down so stancedancing was no longer a real thing and I lost interest due to lower effort needed to play as a tank. Looking forward to have to fight for the agro once again in classic!
---
Yeah, because Karazhan and Gruul's Lair were easier, and the rewards were much better? Then you went to heroics for some challenge, what's strange about that? I mentioned Heroic Mana Tomb because that was more of a DPS race and there was not much trick to take down the boss effortlessly.
---
What makes you think frost mages wont have just the same access to ALL of these tools as well? Have you ever tried to kill a deep frostmage with gnomish cloaking device, net-o-matic and rocket-helmet? they are literally unkillable, blink, 2x iceblock, invisibility from cloaking device + potion, free action potion.
---
Engineering as well as any other specific rare trinkets or consumables ONLY make you more viable if you face against someone else who doesnt have them as well. Which wont be the case anymore among pvpers in 2019.
---
Its delusional to try to add any non-class specific items or professions into the equation of wether class x can beat class y (with the only exceptions of ice/shadow/nature/fire reflectors which really make a huge difference and only benefit against some classes), because everyone can use all of these tools just as well. So what, you use your net o matic on the mage as a warrior to keep him rooted and think that will win you the fight? He just uses his own net o matic on you (or just blink out ...) and now you're both standing there rooted for 10s while he keeps spamming icebolts, well done.
---
And to top that of: mages are FAR less gear dependant than warriors, they can easily switch out their trinkets, helmet &amp; boots ect. without sacrificing much of their damage.
---
No formulas.
---
Don’t have to wait to find a tank or a healer.  Avoid getting ganked by people traveling in packs.  Multiple characters who can do multiple things at level 60 if you’re an alt/profession junky.
---
You are in Japan probably! Happy cake daaaaay!
---
Loot Council is by far the best way and not even close. If you join a corrupt guild dkp will be as fucked as LC will be. In a regular guild LC is better because as long as you are not a social troglodyte you’ll be fine since you’ll be friends with your guildies anyway
---
Because the first raid of the next expansion ~4 months later was there.
---
Next up mage is conjuring water. Its not success worthy of sharing. Its literally something every single mage can do easily and he does it poorly even.
---
In Vanilla I did a few sessions this long and more. I may do it once or twice this time around if the addiction takes hold. I don't recommend it though, definitely not healthy.
---
I've tested layering over the last 10 years while playing countless different MMOs. It is a garbage system, the majority agrees with me.
---
Shame they only invited like 50 people
---
The guy who responded to you doesn't understand the social aspect of the game that the rest of us are going for. Of course we know the AI is meant to be beaten. Of course PvP is a bit more challenging. Of course wrestling is fake. Doesn't mean I don't enjoy it any less!
---
can you explain why?
---
because class set is just a matter of luck and runs and respect and or group comp (yes locks i have no respect and i will roll on your dreadmist as a spriest)
---
i wont play alone, old mates are comming back and half the retail guild is gonna come too (granted i know many will leave for retail again)
---
so before i even hit 60 there is a high chance i will have several pieces already seeing it isnt lvl 60 gear (58max needed for last piece) you can run instances after eachother unlike 1 clear of a raid each week.
---
tier1 yes thats gonna take some time if you arnt a gm/officer/prio seeing thats 9bosses a week with larger loot pools then they drop and alot more ppl that want it
---
Yeah absolutely. It’s just that there are many more leathers per hour (20?) and they are much harder to control later.
---
So unless you have a serious mafia going on you will probably not be able to cause that insane level of damage. At first people will not have enough gold to pay for huge prices and you will have a much harder time to make it difficult for them to farm their own devilsaur.
---
Nope, it's definitely better! Did you open the correct file? ;)
---
Horde version can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/0p7wVqu)
---
They have a concurrency cap that they'll stick to for each layer (and later on when layers are removed, each server).
---
They have made estimates on how big they think that the drop-off will be and plan out the number of realms and number of layers per realm accordingly.
---
They have however mentioned (I can't remember where they said it but it was during the summit) that if servers are overcrowded after the layers are removed they'll create more servers and offer free transfers.
---
Hunter. Seriously though, Hunter.
---
The last system we used when raiding in retail was EPGP and I seem to remember it working out: 
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/EPGP](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/EPGP)
---
What if its a really short fight and you can't force low HP?
---
Lol Newsflash pvp player throwing shade at pve player.  Hates that somebody is different.  See my previous comment about misery loving company.
---
Oh awesome! I appreciate the work a ton! Where can I see the updated version?
---
Someone pointed out that Belfs are the most common race in retail and I like the idea of leaving them out to promote race diversity
---
Should have got on 'em for bringing a civilian to a combat situation
---
people keep saying this "you can still pvp on a pve server" but that's misleading at best and outright wrong at worst. you may technically be able to "pvp" on a pve server, but it's nothing at all like pvp on a pvp server.
---
consent-required pvp completely alters the entire concept of WoW pvp:
---
-- several classes are at a severe disadvantage by not having the opener eg rogues, warriors, hunters, casters, etc.. 
---
-- if you enable your pvp tag (so you're looking for pvp), someone can literally form a party or raid while untagged just to jump you. 
---
-- you can never eliminate opposite-faction competition for resources. period. have fun watching that level 50 gnome pick your black lotus while you sit helpless in your aq gear.
---
-- anyone you happen to kill can log over to your faction and harass you. in this sense, pve servers are actually *more* toxic than pvp.
---
no, it isn't worth it. no, you can't *pvp* on a pvp server; you can only "pvp" on a pve server.
---
I agree with majority of what you have said other that the neutral AH side, i will be  rolling a PvP server at first see how things go, if i decide i wanna raid (or get into a raid guild) if my server is mostly English (Damn Blizzard) etc. If things do not work out and i feel the need to start again i will roll on a PvE server for many of the reasons you have mentioned.
---
Just like twinking and 1-shotting badly geared people in BGs it's fun to delete and dominate others.
---
It's also a challenge gearing up, soloing instances etc. Gives the game a lot of depth. Having 5 geared elemental shamans 1-shotting 2-3 people with chain lightning is a sight to behold.
---
Ok i'll bite, explain to me how you plan to make gold for a level 40 mount with cooking and how it's more time efficient than right clicking a dead mob in front of you.
---
Because old tier 2 models that dropped pre 1.4 weren't fixed yet and the newer ones that dropped were? The old pieces stopped dropping in MC by that time. 
---
I mean there is even images in the launch trailers with the models in game. Blizzards official trailers.
---
Like I said... 
---
"Old tier 2 (old look too) removed from MC from patch 1.4. New models were added 1.6 with BWL along with new looks. 1.9 was when the old models no longer existed within the game."
---
&gt;the way "leeway" works on the classic beta is that it simply increases your characters melee range whenever you and your target is moving 
---
From what I can tell in Classic, there are two effects in play - Melee Extension via strafing or backpeddling, and also the Leeway attacks going off regardless of range ~.2 seconds after target is technically out of range. I don't think they're the same mechanic, but just happen to function at the same time.
---
Countdown to Classic podcast does a great job explaining this
---
Is the target market for this game really the people currently subscribed to retail?  
---
Not everyone even playing retail got a beta invite.
---
Tons of people who would actually play beta aren’t allowed to play.
---
Capping at 40 limits people’s willingness to play much once there.  
---
Knowing your efforts are deleted come August limit people’s willingness to put time in now. 
---
Not making excuses, just pointing out facts.
---
Most world PvP isn’t decided by gear, its who gets the opening drop and usually who is lower level.
---
I’m just saying that there’s no challenge, it’s okay if that’s what you prefer.
---
It’s your own fault if that offends you.
---
Will smith boy
---
I think there is an explanation behind that. But assuming new T2 look were added in 1.6, how could Nefarian both World first and EU first beeing done with the old T2 ?
---

---
First to tag it gets loot. Simple as that. And your absolutely right. There isn't a whole lot you can do about and the things you can do like pulling extra mobs over can get you banned.
---
If they gave t3 a faceguard, it would look similar to the footmen captain models you see in wc3. I dont think either set looks all that bad, however judgement is clearly the winner in classic.
---
Dat Stormrage
---
Maybe me or someone else will get around to making them then
---
It rarely happened like that. Membership attrition happens all the time, but its driven by bad guild management and bad progression(partly fed by bad management). Bad management in terms of personaility and loot distribution is kind of random, but bad progression is largely relative.
---
Usually the top guilds recruit from the worse raid guilds, who either break up or are forced to recruit the newer players and slow their progression.
---
When AQ hits, you dont suddenly stop farming BWL and MC, sure new people get gear faster, but they get waaaay behind the vetrrans in terms of new gear.
---
You just realised i'm right and that layering isn't going anywhere. Hahah don't want to hear it do you?
---
&gt; You seem rather negative about the future of Classic WoW.
---
No I don't, I'm just being realistic.
---
1. They've bundled the games together.
---
2. They're planning a level squish back to 60 in a future expansion.
---
3. They're planning other major core changes.
---
4. They make over half their revenue on microtransactions.
---
Blizzard is planning to convert Classic players over to Retail. It's that simple. I want them to succeed and turn Retail into a game both playerbases can love.
---
I'm pretty sure it's a legal hassle they don't want to deal with. The EULA for EU and NA are quite different, especially where data protection is concerned. Even a game like Hearthstone doesn't share account information between regions.
---
I assume that PvP crowd consists of higly competitive players, who just enjoy to PvP on forums/Reddit also xD
---
I remember getting T1 shoulders from Lucy that looked completely different.
---
I had a lot on the PvP part so i think that my choice i clear now, i want to laught and have fun i'm going on PvP server !
---
Yeah. It sucks.
---
I guess you would carry the staff with you just for the portal by then.
---
If you’re in a corrupt guild they’ll just say you’re doing some bullshit to lose DKP. If you have LC the equipment will be distributed efficiently as opposed to a point system where anyone can roll on whatever. LC pushes the teamwork factor to make raiding easier for everyone, but in DKP some asshole can get his off-set pieces over your main slots. LC is an optimization of resources meant to make the guild as effective a killing machine as possible. DKP is like a participation trophy, and LC is achieving a goal as a team on the most optimal was possible.
---
Colorado! Sunshine State!
---
See for many of  us, the world pvp is something we actually enjoy doing.  I don't want to wait until phase 3 to actually do some PvP.
---
You're going to want to know what levels your VW can learn important ranks such as torment, and sacrifice.  When these rank up your power increases a lot.  
---
You also seem to have immolate in your rotation but not in your purchase these skills section?  Are you just planning to use downranked immolate?
---
Different professions is why I make different characters. Just pay postage mailing materials.
---
Though if i am going to make 5 characters, they would be different classes or at least different talent tree builds.
---
This entire post is filled with bullshit and misinformation. Chat and AH are NOT affected by layering. It would be great if idiots who haven't even touched the beta or a stress test would stop making shit up and posting it as fact.
---
You would need to either  level through HW &amp; SB expansion or buy a story skip&amp; level boost to be able to play ShB right away.  
---
Sofar I love it.

I'm a big proponent of PvP servers and wPvP in general, but I do wish people could just chill and let others play what they like.
---
I resubbed to try the stress test, and the nostalgia wave was so strong I immediately reupped for 6 months. It didn't feel old and clunky; it felt like an RPG that happened to have lots of other players. 
---
In the last few weeks I've played through patches 8.1 and 8.2 of BFA, and am back in the perpetual reputation grind through dailies. The rep grind is so tedious and boring that I've gone back to Warlords of Draenor content to finish the Tanaan jungle rep grinds...which are better than BFA. Yes, I'd say that WoD is actually good relative to the current design pattern WoW is following.
---
Come Aug 27th, I likely will be done with post-Cataclysm WoW forever. 
---
My biggest issue is finding a guild that's casual friendly but large enough to be viable for 2-4 years. I'll raid, but I won't be at the cutting edge of progression raiding. I'll likely never step into Naxx, but Molten Core / Zul'Gurub / AQ20 is probably my end game. I'm fine with that.
---
Yep. But it’s easy to u defat and because all the social media surrounding the game is focused on the view from the top. The problem is the “esporting” of wow is exactly the reason no one wants to play it.
---
It's an opinion. It's subjective. That's why the debate will always go on.
---
I just like pvp servers cuz I can lvl my mage, go to a nabs area and perma CC someone without killing them. Gg virginity
---
The deception would be where they stated that they want to have phasing entirely gone by the end of Phase 1.  This can only happen if the population drops enough to end layering.  If, at the end of Phase 1, the population is still too high, you get the quote the poster above you made.
---
I used to multibox and began to do it with keyclone back around WotLK. I'll be glad to give you my answer as to why I multiboxed. 
---
I first encountered multiboxing when I was in Alterac Valley and as I crossed the field of strife I just dropped dead. First I thought there was a bug or something, but after checking my combat log, I realized there were five Orc shamans with the same name. Originally I thought they were cheating so I googled it and found keyclone. After a few hours of reading it, I went to the store and found four copies of WoW and came home to test it out. 
---
I made five shamans and started my journey. I think the server I went to was Blackrock US and I knew it was a Horde heavy server, so I made five draenei shamans named "elemental" (original I know). Leveling was horrible due to collection quests (no one tells you that when you start). Eventually I made it to max level and I started running battlegrounds. 
---
Multiboxing in battlegrounds was insanely fun when I first started out. It's like I was a comic book character who just found out they had superpowers. I'd press lightning bolt and bam, people would just drop dead. I'd sit in the AV boss room and while the horde rushed in, they'd be met with five lava elementals, five chain lightning spam and five lava burst + elemental mastery combos. There were days I'd just sit in AV trying to farm honor kills. 
---
I received many rage whispers which included a wide array of things. Anywho, I moved onto a new program called ISboxer and around that time multiboxers were moving onto arena. So I went into that. I tried the five shamans in arena and as expected it was much harder than pressing three buttons in battlegrounds. So I needed to make macros for each of my characters. When that didn't work, I found a healer who was curious about multiboxing and wanted to heal my shamans. It worked out pretty well as we peaked to just around 2,000 rating, which I was really proud of. But we reached a point where I couldn't handle an entire enemy team by myself since I started running into the same people. 
---
I then made four DKs and then a paladin. I would describe it similar to playing a hunter. I healed on the paladin and the DKs would run around and kill people. I kid you not, the DKs were controlled with one button. I had something similar to WoWLazyMacro and it would rotate through their skills and I just pressed that button a bunch. With that team I reached around 1800 rating. 
---
Around this time I began to realize something. World of Warcraft was becoming less fun by the day. Obviously if you're a multiboxer you can play by yourself. But I didn't really interact with anyone anymore. So I just had to stop and I went back to a single character. An MMO isn't really fun (for me) when there isn't anyone to play with. 
---
I imagine people will multibox in Classic because of the fun that comes with killing people within a global or the challenge of trying to do dungeons by yourself. (Those were fairly hard since positioning was not always fun). However since I don't think /follow is working Classic, we might not see too many multiboxers since many multiboxers quit due it being removed in modern WoW.
---
When i read all you guys cool tips to kill him I feel like my 700 iq ding regen was more like 250 iq at best
---
There are even pvp videos from 2005 that show tier 2 new models...
---
DKP are for more casual guilds where you dont have enough people who are heavily invested in the game and understands multiple classes mechanics and reasons why one or the other class should have an item.  
---
Loot council is a lot better for hardcore guilds where you simply make sure that each item will benefit the guild progression the most. This requires a lot of people to have extensive knowledge of several classes and know all of the BiS items and how the viable builds benefits from most stats.
---
i liek this duality
---
most of you proclaim lvl-ing is part of the adventure
---
but the same ppl are like i need to rush rush to 60
---
you wanna experience classic start (not end) then no addons till atleast raidtime
---
you read/immerse in quest text, you ask ppl for help thus also making friends and meeting ppl. you actually start knowing your maps, and node spawns etc. you will pass stuff your precious guide wont take you because non effecient (wich 9 out of 10 times also means non fun). there are some gems of low lvl quests you will not do because they are out of the way or not xp efficient, you will miss end of chain quest rewards  etc
---
and tbh if you arnt new, reading half the text will trigger your brain and you know where and what to do.
---
 but if those are your goals you might want to rethink your 1month stay in classic because alot fo stuff will bite you in the behind.
---
exploring is taking a step in the for you unknown, if you just gonna follow a guide and/or read up infront... i dunno maby gaming is not for you and you should watch ppl play on stream?!?!
---

Oh right, I forget about that little bastard patch after 12
---
Not everyone wants to wait until phase 3 to actually do some PvP.  We don't know what the faction balance will be like, and we don't know how long (if ever) it will take to become that unbalanced on a specific server.
---
What’s your guild? Does it have an ad in the LFG thread?
---
Have fun on the classic megaservers.
---
I mean it will be okay. It will just be a lot worse than it could have been. Enjoy.
---
This is why I laugh when people say "yeah just use your imp to level it's faster".. they must not play on a pvp server..  Using a VW not only keeps your hp/mana higher if you play it right, but you have sac for when the ganking gets serious.
---
Worth it to have all your alts get 15hk?
---
It's such low resolution, are you still using the same monitor from vanilla days?
---
thought you only kissed sarge's ass simmons?
---
You are welcome to disagree as strongly as you like, it won’t change the fact that you are wrong lol
---
im gonna miss not being a goblin mage in classic FeelsBadMan
---
Thanks, I will
---
Yes indeed.  The game has a lot to offer.  Oddly enough one of my favorite aspects of the game is battlegrounds.  I do not enjoy killing other players that are out questing.  I do not enjoy getting killed while out questing.  To your point, that aspect feels anti-social.  But for some people, that part “makes” the game.  And that’s great for them, it’s just not for me.
---
I mean don't sell yourself short that is a cool strat it just takes a lot of setup xD
---
T5 for me definitely. Just all-around incredible for most classes. Priest T5 (Avatar set) is literally the reason I made a Priest alt the first time I saw someone wearing it. Shoutout to T6 as well, especially for Paladin and Shaman
---
This dude has been posting dumb shit all morning.... just walk away quietly.....
---
The video clearly shows that the mobs never hit him from more than 5 yards away, except when the attack already started, which is the leeway mechanic that should exist. In the beta mobs hit from almost 8 yards away consistently while moving. If their attack starts from their extended range and leave the extended range it can go through giving it an extended range and a leeway stacking.
---
The mage being able to stay closer to mobs than 7.66 yards is proof that a flat out extension of melee range didn't exist, because that's what happens on the beta.
---
&gt; can you explain why?    
---
Low drop-rate.    
---
A few pieces are BoE (Belt, Bracers, Gloves) but can be expensive/rare on a new realm. The others, like Feet and Chest can be quite time consuming to get as they only drop infrequently from end-bosses/rare spawns. Several pieces required me to do 10+ instance runs to get (hour+/run).    
---
Plus the question was about casual play. You seem to be bragging about running the same instance back to back for hours with an elite group, which while effective isn't very relevant to this topic. You'll still put in the same effort, but just squeeze it into weeks instead of months.
---
After being ganked, my favorite was always: /disappointed
---
I'm #morechanges but nah, keep it. I'm here to support the #nochanges crowd by advocating to leave crap like this in. You're welcome.
---
fix layering
---
And that's fine. You guys know what you want to do. This sub has a tendency to shit on anyone who wants to play the game on a PvE server which is why I made this post, not to incite PvP players but rather to rally my fellow PvE players and those who are in the middle.
---
......??......
---
Is this a joke? This must be a joke,
---
I feel like only someone who likes retail and either actively or recently plays it...
---
I will never roll on a PVP server. I did that in vanilla and i dont feel any need to do it again. Getting camped by some asshole working out his nerd rage by seal clubbing lower level players isnt fun.

For those of you that were in the first stress test(s), when were invites sent out? Just curious for the July stress test and when to look out for the invites. The only info I found is it's sent out "shortly before" the date.
---
ALRIGHT LETS DO THIS! LEEEEERRRRROOYYY JEREEEEENNNKKINNSS!
---
easy. all of them :)
---
I'm gonna state the obvious: pvp pservers can not be related to classic servers regarding their cancerness, community and overpopulation.
---
What? The only time full-on BM is viable is right after you hit 60, if your guild is raiding really early. It scales like crap which is why it’s only useful when you don’t have decent gear. 
---
Unless you mean “TBC” by “Late Game”. The only truly late game spec is LR with an outrageous of agility that’s only achievable in practically full BiS and stacking every possible agi buff and world buff.
---
And 4 extra subscriptions for perpetuity
---
I don't know about queue times, but you will be waiting until phase 3 for the first two BGs to be released.
---
I tried a pve server once. The first time I ran across a player of the enemy faction he was taking my mobs or farming node. I couldn't put a stop to the madness. I just had to sit there and watch my enemy take what was rightfully mine without a way to fight back. I immediately deleted that character and went back to pvp servers. 
---
It was borderline traumatic and I hated it so much. How can I not fight my enemies? Why are there two factions if they can't even interact. The role playing side of the game was dead, the danger was gone, and adventure was dead.
---
How long does it take to get to 40 ? Is leveling faster than it used to be because this shit took forvere back in the day ?
---
Misinterpreted that, my bad. You’re right though and I’m most excited about the journey to get there anyways. I guess seeing all these posts about racing to 60 had me second guessing if I’d be left out but I’m sure there’s a ton of other players in my shoes. Just have to find a guild in the same spot like you said.
---
You want the actual leeway mechanic. It just compensates for actual latency. There were private servers with 0 leeway and trust me. If there is no leeway whatsoever, you can run inside the enemy and won’t hit it.
---
The explanation with the 0.2 second thing vs the range thing is good, though. That hits the nail.
---
That's my guild and that was our guild leader during Naxx, fury warriors needed the best gear to do decent DPS (Lilos In this video has full BIS gear) 
---
We actually attempted this another time and do even more damage with more buffs but he ended up generating took much threat got killed. 
---
Fury warriors needed the best gear and also a fight like this where you don't need to move alot or change targets helps alot also but I guess that goes for any melee DPS.
---
If you are trying to grind and playing that fun balancing game of mp5 vs mana out vs life tap vs hp regen vs drain life improved drain soul is the thing that tips the whole equation in longevity.  Without improved drain soul everything is a net negative and you're forced to take combat breaks regularly.  
---
Now that's just about grinding.. if you're more into world pvp then for sure you do you.
---
Exactly my situation. I recently took it upon myself to keep the AH stocked with bags just incase someone needs them but in the beta I am lucky if I run across 5-10 people in a night. 
---
Basically working on my routes and plan also reading reddit for ideas of things to test.
---
Arial. You'll be staring at it all day so may as well picm something easy
---
Keep absolutely still. Their vision is based on movement.
---
Which will balance out the corpse runs I guess?
---
There's been so many times when I survive with 2-5% health, I'll take the survivability over ever so slightly mana regen any day. But the great thing about Classic is you should play it how you want to, so enjoy your extra spirit OP.
---
Dire Maul will not be out during phase 1. Might need to change that unless your leveling REALLY slow.
---
Thanks for the write up. I'm looking into isoboxer for dual leveling warrior and priest. Cuz it's too painful to level warrior solo :P any tips?
---
The age of the bananas will rise again!
---
Not the dude you are arguing with, but it's pretty simple - you start grinding proper meats around level 30, good first targets are the turtles in Hillsbrad. A stack of cooked turtle meat sells for 90s. You also get pretty decent greys and additional clam meat which can be cooked. 
---
It's more time efficient because you only need to loot things once, and cooking can be done in bulk. Skinning adds 3 seconds to every loot, which adds up over the course of leveling.
---
I'm still going to be taking skinning though. Not super worried about being a couple hours late.
---
If you play on a pvp server immolate can be great
---
I just told you I literally could not play the game at all if I had to wait for hours because of other mandatory things in my life. Many of us adults couldn't. Also many kids couldn't. Do you think it's selfish to think that everyone should get a chance to play? I think it's selfish of you to think that so many of us should give up the game completely just so you could have the game exactly how \*you\* like it, and not one bit different.
---
I hope you really do read this and think about what being selfish means...
---
I compare loot council to communism.  In theory, should be great.  In practice a few people get rich and everyone else starves to death.
---
PVP was fun back when the game was new and everyone sucked. The skill gap was small and it was more of a fun adventure. Nowadays, the skill gap is huge with pro e-sports wannabes. YouTube/Twitch streamers want to produce content by any means necessary. And the general internet culture is a lot more toxic and griefy. I for one will not be subjecting myself to this. I would not roll on a PVP server unless you consider PVP the overwhelming primary purpose of the game, over questing, raiding, farming, social, etc.
---
Right?! No way to deter foreign invaders on home soil. Appaling to think a gnome can run around WC and feel secure
---
&gt;Compare it to this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Z8MTAX-nQ&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Z8MTAX-nQ&amp;t)
---
Jesus fucking christ... Pause that when the worgens attacks at 10 seconds and see how utterly retarded and broken this stupid leeway shit is. The mob is meleeing him from outside FN range...
---
But again, where's the deception? As far as we can tell, Ion and the boys really do expect a sharp dropoff in population, meaning layering can go away early.
---
Disagreeing with their projection is one thing, but we have no reason to believe they're lying about any of this.
---
It's the same as every other profession. You turn something not worth much into something maybe 2 to 6x the price of materials you consumed.
---
I'll be taking skinning, leatherworking, cooking, and fishing because of this. You loot skins while leveling, turn them into greens with LW, then ship them to your bank alt to DE and turn into wands or  which you can then sell for a profit.
---
Cooking you just take the meat from your inventory and quadruple the vendor price by cooking it.
---
Of course, one of the things I'm looking forward to most is the return of a general community standard of behavior.  With that said, I'm just looking for a more relaxing experience this time around, and if I find I miss it I can just re-roll.
---
Have you heard of our lord and saviour the Melee hunter?
---
Your neighbour is probably done fucking your wife now. No need to hide in safe spaces on Reddit anymore!
---
To add to point 2. It’s just not shadowbolt and curse spam. Lifetap timings and proper consumable usage will give the benefit of minimizing your global cooldowns and allow for you to cast more shadow bolts.
---
I remember seeing someone in the full Transcendence for the first time, with Benediction (I believe)  and was blown the hell away.  That and the Judgement set, insanely epic.

As someone who has spent allot of time on PS and this sub reddit I declare that most vocal vanilla fans don't care about the lore, instead their all about the gameplay. Also thier highly competitive and crave status which leads to them wanting to be the best ganker
---
PvE servers effectively won't have any form of PvP aside dueling or the STV arena for a minimum of 6-8 months.
---
Which is perfect since the PvE vocal minority think that world PvP should be punishable by death via the Geneva Convention, and that anyone who does enjoy it is &lt;insert ad hominem here&gt;.
---
PTR also does not require a sub yeah.
---
&gt; Battle Shout is very good for aoe aggro early on.
---
Assuming the party is in range, Battle Shout is the best AoE threat generation ability for Warriors throughout the game.

$5 to read the rest of that article...

Googled it elsewhere and found:
---
&gt;Time spent sitting might be taking the place of activity, including light levels of daily activity. Health effects of light levels of activity have not been studied.
---
&gt;Time spent sitting may be associated with other unhealthy activities; for example, snacking while watching TV.
---
&gt;Time spent sitting has a negative impact on the body’s hormone levels and the way the immune system works. This may be a factor in the link between sitting time and mortality.
---
I mean, I get that it's not great for you, but it says (in my article) thar you'd need to sit less than 3 hours a day to not be lumped into the category of "sitters". Anybody who sits less than 3 hours a day, it's no surprise they live longer considering the amount of exercise they get moving around.
---
And 2 of the 3 "negatives" I listed are basically "you may do unhealthy things if you sit". If you don't then you're obviously way better off than those who do.
---
Just wanted to throw that out there before someone freaks out at the sensationalist headline and worries about sitting.
---
If memory serves the term comes from the colossan ammount of birts after the war. Explosion of births or some such.
---
there is more to do at level 60 in classic wow, than there is leveling 100-&gt;110 and completing all crafting/questing/rep grinds in the current BFA expansion... .WITHOUT ever stepping into a raid. 
---
the end game dungeons (Scholo/Strat/LBRS/UBRS/BRD/Dire Maul) are challenging enough. crafting takes months to master. there's open world bosses (Nathanos Blightcaller for example) who drop decent gear and require coordination. there's seasonal events. questing is complicated. 
---
pvp is better, since the skill trees are more complex and you have more abilities. the 3 battlegrounds in classic have never been eclipsed in any expansion since; they're still the best maps.
---
molten core is easy enough, that 6-12 months into the expansion PUGs will readily take new 60s in green gear, as 10-15 good players can carry the raid. (this is the advantage of 40 man raids). zul gurub 20 similarly needs 10 good players and can carry others.
---
World pvp is a useless comparison, I only count direct duels and/or bg/arena situations. 
---
Pretty much anyone can kill anyone else if he gets on him unsuspected, thats no solid base ground for any balancing discussions. Hunter is the best example for that, if anyone jumps on an unsuspecting hunter, the hunter is dead, but if the hunter jumps on anyone unsuspecting from 41y away, that other guy ends up dead.
---
Heck I used to run around with gnomish mind control cap on my rogue back then to gank groups waiting outside of dungeon entrances, mind controlling their rogue/war/hunter, nuking their caster and then fighting the rest with evasion/blade flurry/adrenaline on, just winning 1v3-5. That doesnt say anything about rogues, or even engineering though, just that they were unprepared and unsuspecting noobs.
---
Also since you mention world pvp, mages can use the rocket helmet to get away of a fight by charging to another player or a nearby mob.
---
Pretty sure it's because of all the derisive comments about the "average" pvp player. I played PVP in vanilla and didn't particularly like pvping...  but I liked the way it made the world feel more alive.
---
I think most of the time you can deal with gankers, without losing too much time, by either going somewhere else, calling for help pe being sneaky.
---
That’s the spirit!
---
This isn't about cost though. In Blizzard's estimation, server merges would be more disruptive to the game than layering for the beginning of release.
---
You're welcome to disagree; I do myself. But this isn't a question of greed or profit. They just have a different idea of how to smooth over the population falloff.
---
I haven’t tanked higher than SM, so I just claim what I know! Thank you for enlightening further.
---
It is fun.
---
It allows lvling multiple classes. I am going for druid(PVE tank, PVP healer)/priest(healer)/mage/2 warlocks in my first team.
---
2nd team I might go hunter/rogue/warlock/shaman/warrior. Then I will have 1 of every class on horde.
---
Going to be very squishy in world pvp with all cloth characters but might be a fun group. A lot of dots/hots/aoe/cc and ~60-68 stealth detection to prevent rogues from creeping up on me.
---
It makes it easier to get gold.
---
Can do 5 man dungeons solo.
---
Some are going to try to multibox raid (mostly several people running 5 man groups). If there is enough on horde EU that does it then I would join them, but I don't think so. Most are going alliance and many are US.
---
It is also fairly low cost. Most things people do cost more, even someone smoking pay more money to do it every month (while also hurting their body) than someone that play their own 5 man team in wow.
---
Follow doesn't work in bgs in classic so likely noone is going to multibox that.
---
Literally?
---
No idea why that was downvoted.
---
Knowing that in order to progress your character, you need to spend a lot of time and dedication, was a key-motivator for many to keep playing and play more.
---
In PvP you'll have better geared people as opponents and on your side. And you'll have badly geared people as opponents and on your side. So you can still win. But you'll also be motivated to improve your character in whatever feasible way.
---
The vanilla-experience is more like chasing a carrot on the stick... as compared to nowadays feasts for everyone all the time.
---
That's while it always made you come back for more instead of having you feal satiated.
---
There isn't a lot of context here, but I'll list a few things that may have made it hard. Was your party higher level than you (like 20 or 22) Did you mark Skull and X to focus damage? Were you in defensive stance? Did you spam Sunder Armor? I used to spam heroic strike to tank when I started...doesn't work lol. Did the dps wait to dps Skull for 2 or 3 seconds or were the warriors just charging in? I'm not experienced with PServers or anything, these are just things I thought of to ask in case anyone else can assist with more information.
---
I've been on both for a long time each and they both have their pros and cons. I enjoy both for different reasons. I'll have a toon on both because my wife would not play on a pvp server because she is new and gets frustrated easily with pvp lol.
---
I'll have to test that out, maybe something like hotkeynet to map a few keys. For the first 30 levels or so the priest will pretty much be carrying the warrior since it has no dps until then.
---
I personally will be rolling on PvE because I have limited time to play. I don't want to be bothered with getting ganked, or killed by the enemy faction on my way to a dungeon or something when I might only have 2-3 hours to play on any given day. Not worth all the time spent dead imo.
---
I like it consensual, on my schedule, and if its going to be with strangers then I want clearly defined terms of engagement before we begin.
---
Also, I like to play on PVE servers.
---
Still remember getting the boring red hood off Ony, then being so stoked when the models got updated...can't wait for classic release
---
Wearing the nemesis helm around IF everybody would laugh at me. Then after inspecting they'd ask me where the hell I got it. Information wasn't as wide spread then so it made for some funny moments.
---
so what?
---
On the other side of the coin, the part of the game we enjoy is the part that you loathe. The fun part to us is getting in a large scale war, avoiding gankers or mass murdering a small lakeside town until people show up to try and force us out.
---
The part you are looking to enjoy is nothing more than a chore, a mere means to an end for us.  Yes we too will raid for gear, but raiding isn't the fun part. Its using that raid gear and newfound power therefrom to kill the other faction with.
---
So I'm glad you realized that PvP in Vanilla/Classic WoW isn't for you. But don't go around assuming your s doens't stink.  There are many different types of players that enjoy different aspects of the game.

The key is not to overagro as a tank ..... what I mean by that, just because you have extra rage does not mean you need to spend it all if the mob is already on you. 
---
Keep some rage for the next pack for that snap agro. Tactical Mastery talent is a MUST for early tanks. It helps SOOOO much.
---
Main rotation is Charge into Demo into Sunders .... with a stance change in between. Use Revernge anytime you can, dont worry about shield block unless you have enough rage and need mitigation. Apply sunders by single targeting the mobs around you .... oh yeah you have NO AOE agro abilities so it will be fun.
---
You will know the list when Blizzard will make it public.
---
Probably at the end of July/beginning of August, since on August 13th the name reserve option for Classic going to hit.
---
I'd say 2 weeks before August 13th we will know the full realm list.
---
Ofc, it will most likely be UPDATED before launch, because I expect much more people than Blizzard does to resub to the game.
---
FNG SMH
---
Wpvp is fun when it's not completely one sided, problem is that it usually is.
---
I always found PvP servers to be the most toxic.. sadface.
---
The lack of taunt is the only issue. But if you mark mobs and focus them down in that order it should be OK for everybody.
---
Doesn't really matter. It's only the mp/5 you're gonna get since if you're leveling efficiently you won't stop casting anyway, and that's a pittance. What's more, even the squishyness of a mage during leveling is noticable.
---
Int (Endurance to cast) &gt; Stamina (survival) &gt; Spirit (Still blah, but beats agi/str).

You described Reddit in a nutshell. Many vocal minorities shouting at the top of their lungs for fake internet points.
---
I love how the rogue set went from "Shadocraft red" to one of the best looking sets in the game (IMO). 
---
Side note, the [Dragonfang Blade](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=19346) the rogue is carrying was incredible. I remember when I got that and my DPS jumped drastically considering I was using the [Gutgore Ripper](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17071/gutgore-ripper) before.
---
&gt;I know this take isn't for everyone
---
Seems silly to me

Basically MMO's went from the days of challenging/hardcore to what we have now, the days of convenience and ease at all costs.  I played UO back in the day ('98 - '02, and then Everquest until WoW in '04) and when you died you lost all of your loot, stuck a ghost until you ran to a shrine or someone ressed you.  WoW Vanilla had res sickness, I think it was for like 10 minutes and nothing permanently lost; we all thought it was extremely forgiving at the time and didn't match the difficulties that other MMO's had out there.  Fast forward and you get players like this:

"...when I log back on, I *still* have 10 minutes of rez sickness? Like, what? How does that contribute to the game? What Blizzard employee thought, "You know, we should penalize players with a 10 minute you-can't-do-anything debuff if they rez immediately, but more than that, they need to be logged in for that 10 minutes to go away." Like, they force you to sit in a corner and do nothing, all the while sucking up bandwidth and processing power for absolutely no reason. "

"Ress sickness is just another absurdly stupid mechanic in the game. Why on earth should you be punished in a manner that STOPS you playing a game we PAY for? Especially when we have died due to another absurdly stupid mechanic, and cant corpse run because of ANOTHER absurdly stupid mechanic etc etc etc. The list goes on. Get rid of it now. I dont even support the durablity loss, yet another stupid mechanic that stops you playing the product we pay for."
---
These types of posts spread throughout every challenging aspect of the game.. and then we got LFG, cross realm BG's, flying mounts, summoning stones, crushing blow tweaks, sharding/phasing, etc. etc.  Now, whenever there is a challenge, these guys bitch and moan because they are paying money and can't be mildly inconvenienced about anything.  Now that Classic is popular, they're attempting to do the same thing here.  It's been frustrating watching the evolution of this subreddit over the last year, as more and more of these guys are spilling in advocating for all of the things that ruined Classic in the first place.
---
It really feels like some of the pvpers are anti-PvE servers because they deprive them of victims to gank.
---
What about the rest of us that think the avoiding / ganking is the game worth playing?
---
At the lower levels it's pretty much use revenge when it pops, spam sunder, use battle shout, throw in a Tclap when rage allows. Dump any excess rage into heroic strike.

There's no proof that that is the actual T2 armor and not a blue or green.

Actually LC is like Capitalism, it just works and thats why the vast majority of all guilds use it.

Damn you’ve responded like 50 times in this thread and you’re ignoring all the video evidence that proves you wrong. Like, how does it feel?

Why didn't you just cheese him and use the fence?

I'm pretty sure the tooltip on the ability is just a estimation and the base value has a damage range
---
Imagine this, you're out in the world doing some gathering and a member of the opposite faction comes up and steals a node right in front of you, then proceeds to /fart on you before riding off to the next node.  
---
On a PVP server, you clap that fool and send them to the graveyard. On a PVE server, you just sit there in a fart cloud with your feelings.

The choice is yours.

Edited. Original one is about become gay when looking at a gay couple if I'm not mistaken.

HoJ and pray.

I only ever played on a PVE server then realised I absolutely love pvp. Battlegrounds were the main reason I played wow.
---
This time it’s on, PVP server. Also rolling horde instead of alliance (I only picked alliance PVE because my friend who quit after 2/3 weeks did) 
---
Must admit though, getting into dark souls has probably prepared me for being ganked and outplayed, so fuck it.
---
Pop imbalance is going to lean to this time around with streamers and realm pop data tools that'd be available soon after launch. Faction imbalance is part of the wow experience
---
I played on / off after a long first stint in Vanilla BC and LK. 
---
Played a bit in Cata, a bit in WoD, a bit in Legion.  
---
Each time pretty hardcore but no more than a few months cause I got burn out.  
---
The worst was Legion. The grind was INSANE. I legit played 14 hours a day for a month and a half. What broke the camel back was this one time I was running the same shitty M+ for the 99th or 100th time (can't remember) to get a relic.  
---
Could never got this damn relic and I had a shitty one compared to the rest of my gear and I needed it to finish my gear.  
---
Relic drops but goes to a shitty shaman that did 1/3 of my damage in the dungeon. Dude was nice, even said that if he could he would trade it.  
---
I was absolutely livid and furious. I uninstalled &amp; unsubbed at that moment.  
---
I was so mad that hardcore grind was not properly rewarded. Like, it still makes me mad nowadays.
---
I think the posts advocating PvP servers exist because a lot of people who never early WoW are on the fence and can't decide which to pick. For those people, I will always recommend PvP as the full, complete WoW experience, you will never feel like you missed out on an aspect of the game. 
---
 If you know for a fact you're not interested in open world PvP,  then absolutely go PvE. Lots of people never PvP, or are only interested in organized symmetrical PvP, which is totally fine. However, those aren't the people looking for advice.
---
Played on a PvE server with PvP flagged. Seeing an enemy in red knowing that you were both up for a fight is a good feeling and you can still help random non flagged people if you feel like it. 
---
Plus there was the fun STV times where I roamed around with my flag on jumping between people and mobs so they flag PvP and murdering them with my friends.
---
I mean I tried a PvE server but it eventually felt like I was only playing a portion of the game
---
They hate it, but you right tho
---
Dunno why people hate on the original sets. I think they're pretty cool. They were really the culmination of the original art style. The redone sets look like the "new" art style from BC.
---
I mean, I guess they're objectively better looking, but they just look so much more "winin" the Vanilla universe.
---
Yea it could have released in some patch inbetween but it was definitly not at the same time as AQ release. They removed the old modells from the files then
---
Well, you described the thought-process that Blizzard had for implementing them.
---
Of course it makes sense on paper.
---
But what it did to me from a psychological point of view was drastically reducing my incentive to further progress in the game.
---
Classic Progression (from a 1.12 perspective looked like this):
---
5 mans/ubrs =&gt; Ony/MC/ZG =&gt; AQ20/BWL =&gt; AQ40 =&gt; Naxx
---
Nowadays it's like this:
---
Current-patch content easy =&gt; Current-patch content normal =&gt; Current-patch content hard =&gt; Current-patch content harder
---
The motivation that results from: If I can manage to make it through MC, I get the chance to see BWL, isn't there. You can see everything, when it's current. It doesn't matter what level I beat it on or if I beat it at all. I'll always get to see the new content when it's there. And to me that's simply not motivating to put effort into it.
---
This is not a thing
---
So what makes a warrior tank a better tank then a druid?
---
&gt;It did not matter at all which class you played
---
Or
---
&gt;is not favored in that match up
---
Which of the 2 is it? How comes there are favored/unfavored matchups if it doesnt matter at all what class you play and its only skill?
---
&gt;beat frost mages **sometimes**
---
"sometimes" (adverb)
---
*occasionally, irregularly, not the norm*
---
How much more can you contradict and disprove yourself in a single post? But you probably also think it required a lot of skill to get that rank 14.
---
Very good, thanks!
---
Good point, i dont read too well. I saw priest and assumed it was a tailor/enchant combo.
---
You dont know how communism works......
---
We used it in late retail, so I can't answer that for you because obviously every raid had 2 tanks and there were no cool unique items. It may not even WORK in vanilla, tbh, I just remember the system being great because all I had to do was basically say "yes" if I wanted something, the system would work out if I got it, and generally everyone was happy.
---
Unless you are a pug or an arsehole - I’ve never heard this said about loot council. 
---
Dkp is the definition of “the rich get richer”
---
No it isn’t, I played on a pve server from day 1. It’s not at all what makes classic so special, it’s infuriating to people like me who have limited time to play getting ganked while leveling making the limited time we have to play even more limited. It’s what makes it special to you, not to the entire community.
---
if he is kicked, he will be ported out the dungeon in 30 or 60 seconds
---
It doesn't apply to NPCs, only to players... You are completely clueless on the topic so why argue about it. Leeway only gives extra range to players. It's a mechanic that vanilla had in place to give melee classes some help in PvP because players weren't exactly where you see them, due to bad internet connections. 
---
You'd see that enemy mage player right in front of you, but in reality they had 500 ping and were outside your melee range, so leeway was there so that you don't get "Not close enough to attack" message spam when you see yourself be right next to the opponent.
---
Since you seem to have asked me, i belive they get booted.
---
When I play retail I still use T2 priest transmog with an alt color. This, T4 warlock, and Judgement are my favorite sets by far
---
Not sure what the joke is here.
---
I can't recall a time where the kick timer wasn't implemented. It's actually really nice for boosting someone. They drop group, tag a huge pull, bunch of level 60's kill them fast, low level gets all the XP, invite back to group before the timer drops.
---
Yes it changed after bwl was cleared, but not when AQ opened as OP is stating
---
Tell me a single weapon a warrior could equip at level 18 that is better than crescent staff.
---
loot democracy, have twitch chat vote who gets each piece. no way it could fail.
---
Link me evidence of the mechanic being implemented in vanilla. I know about PvP melee leeway but it’s also an issue for mobs as well.
---
You'll be somewhere around Westfall on the edge of Elwynn Forest, when the drugs begin to take hold, you'll say something on discord like "I feel a bit lightheaded, maybe you should MT".   When suddenly there will be a terrible roar all around the party, and the sky will be full of what looks like huge bats all swooping and screeching and diving around your mount, and your voice will be screaming on discord:
---
"Holy Arthas!  What are these damn animals"
---
The healer will respond with "Did you say something?"
---
"Hm?  Never mind, its your turn to loot."  No point mentioning the bats, you'll think, poor bastard will see them soon enough.
---
I played as MT for almost exactly 1 year in vanilla I had 43 days /played @ lvl 60 and we cleared all but Cthun and we stopped raiding when tbc was announced so never even cared to enter naxx.   
---
I'd guess \~70% of that time was spent in raids or waiting for raid to start etc. That would be \~14 hours/week excl. time for farming, helping in dungeons, BGs, just hanging around, etc. If you plan on playing 10h/week for 2+ years, well then you will have put in about the same total amount of time as me and should have progressed about as far if your guild consists of the same balance of pros and potatoes :)
---
Just shut up and give blizzard all your money.
---
You responding to an activision white knight. They get very triggered when we give honest feedback.
---
[That looks to be the case](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19321/the-immovable-object)
---
They will when they get banned at 60 and then cry on the forums how their little brother hacked their account and bought gold and they swear it wasn't them
---
So there will be more people killing the mobs you want to kill, and gathering the resources you're gathering WITH layering? How so?
---
People living in glass houses get really antsy when people start throwing rocks!
---
Its possible im only remember rare bugged cases where the person would not get a boot timer so they would sit there. Or even possible they would log out inside the dungeon before timer kicked them out and it would cause the instance to remain full for quite some time.
---
This whole thread is getting me hyped. I have been hyped since Classic was rumored. It just keeps building.  
---
Threat management was so hardcore in Classic
---
This needs to be top comment. When implemented properly all leeway does is make it so you can get an extra attack off when being kited. The way it's currently implemented is increasing the range on everything in the game completely warping all combat.
---
As someone who got one of the server first level 85 achievements, the trick was to repeatedly random queue into the 5 man Blackrock dungeon until you hit 82 (to help, one of the friendly NPC's one-shot a portion of the dungeon after the first boss; if you simply tagged these mobs before he hit them you got full xp), be the first person to deepholm where you'd want to stay for nearly the entire zone, only do uldir until 84 while specifically ignoring the indiana jones chain, and finishing up in twilight highlands.
---
I suppose that's a long way to say that there were arguably better methods than gambling on staying ahead of the pack in hyjal.
---
For what it's worth, you could also get 35% xp from a quest log full of mostly icecrown airship/argent tournament quests... I may have spent a bit too much time planning this..
---
Awe.  Woulda been cool if my favorite comic liked my favorite game.
---
Omg So perfect
---
We cant stop here! the is murloc country!!
---
Love the guide / effort here.  
---
any one else just going in "blind" and not super planning all this shit out or is it just me lol
---
I think you're missing the point that staves are clear DPS winners for most warriors up to and a little bit after level 20.  You can be upset by this, but won't prevent most people from min/maxing their char as you're trying to do with the staff even though the physical dps of the staff is less useful.
---
why would LC be used in a pug?  Explain how DKP = rich get richer?  I can't wait to hear this.
---
Layering is permanent. They are just goinf to rename it something different in phase two to trick you activision white knights.
---
I enjoy retail. Bfa sucks though and im not currently playing though.
---
I also really enjoy vanilla and can barely get myself to play anything because of classic atm. 
---
As someone who likes both, I feel retail is just mechanically harder. Vanilla does most things better for sure, but retail raids and dungeons is without a doubt much harder than any raid or dungeon in vanilla.
---
The problem is not so much that it can't hold aggro but that it'll go oom all the time.
---
Like when you are a healer and manage your mana well-enough so the tank could chain-pull, the paladin can't because he has to drink now! :o
---
 😂  BOY  😂
---
Hey Man! already had a decent NA guild hit me up and they seem casual / what I am looking for but ill be sure to add you as a friend anyway!
---
I play healer and tank mostly.
---
If a dps decides to pull for the tank without asking or when the healer is oom, most tanks/healers will let that dps die. Don't be that dps. That dps gets remembered and not invited.
---
Literally
---
&gt; Leeway back in vanilla was a mechanic that allowed melee attacks to go off up to about 0,2~ sec after the target had moved out of your melee range, thus giving you a bit of leeway to account for the time it took to communicate with servers.
---
Do you have any actual proof of that?
---
Haha
---
I hope it’s slow as hell but the loudest voices usually win.
---
Mana tide is water and wf air, so this doesn't make any sense. Or am I missing something?
---
nice
---
now I want to see one with Cotton Hill as an angry dwarf lol
---
I know the pain, use to main a priest so I know better then to try that.
---
You do realize that's essentially what OP has done, yes?
---
I think pservers had the threat value of BS a little higher than it was.
---
Is it possible? Yes. Is it easy/efficient? No.
---
The biggest problem for Paladin tanks is threat. Their threat generation sucks, and they have no taunt to get mobs back when they lose it. So your group will need to have some sort of threat meter addon installed (or play a class that can drop threat easily, like Rogue or Hunter).
---
Paladin tanks also have issues with mana. They have to spam their abilities just to hold threat, which makes them OOM quickly. And then they generate 0 threat once they're OOM, so that can become an issue on long fights.
---
If you want more information about tanking in Classic check out Skarm on youtube. He's been playing tanks on private servers for a while, he's got a lot of good content for warrior, druid, and even paladin tanks for Classic.
---
Here's one of his videos on Paladin tanking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdNFdBB3GfA
---
I don't think it's common at all for players to go buy mana pots on the AH in between levels especially when you're saving your your mount. In most situations you would be unable to run from a bad situation a mana pot wouldn't save you unless you're inexplicably pulling mobs at low enough mana that you can't even escape if you get super unlucky resists
---
I think the idea is to keep extra spirit gear(if you come across it) and equip it when you are drinking to regen mana faster. At least thats my take.
---
My biggest regret by far about vanilla was playing on a PvE server. That’s where my friend went and I felt obliged to follow. I later tried out PvP servers and realized my massive mistake.
---
I applaud the perseverance
---
DKP is DKP. They can spend it how they want. 
---
Yes in a hardcore progression guilds this wont work but let’s be honest most hard core guilds will just do loot council. 
---
Legendarys are Loot Counciled for my guild. I’m going to have a monthly Decay/Tax to discourage hoarding. With a large tax% before a new tier.
---
Ion said ~2 months for the first 2. 
---
So we're looking at the honor system, world bosses, and end of Layering sometime around mid/late November.
---
And then battlegrounds and BWL will either release mid-December or right after the New Year (Blizzard doesn't like releasing major content during the holidays, but this is legacy, so who knows).
---
Beyond that, he said they'd be looking at community progression to determine the phase schedule.
---
[Source](https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=571).
---
The belief in leeway comes from it being hardcoded to the 1.12 client. All melee abilities light up from further away when you and the target are both running, indicating that you should be able to hit them.
---
As [discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9tnnm7/classic_demo_list_of_class_mechanics_that_arent/) already during the demo half a year ago, melee leeway is at least bugged in the sense that it should be disabled if the attacker or receiver is slowed by 30% or more. As such, targets slowed by improved blizzard, CoC, etc. should not be able to attack further away. In the 1.12 client, sinister strike does not light up from further away when one target is slowed, as it does in the first video.
---
Counterpoint: The proper way to use a firestone is like this,
---
* Spend lots of off-time dueling with rogues in your guild.
---
* One day, show up to the duels with a soul link build and a firestone equipped.
---
* DoT them and beat on them with your firestoned dagger/sword every chance you get.
---
* Whether you win or you lose, start talking about how you can't wait to get the guild's first Perdition's Blade that drops to go with your sick firestone build.
---
The vast majority of all guilds use Loot Council. Its low administration and optimal result for Vanilla loot.
---
Even if you're specced MM, you'll be using your pet as often as you would if you were BM. He'll just do a little bit less damage, and you don't have Beastial Wrath. People will tell you that hunters "never used their pets" in raids in vanilla. That's just simply not true. 
---
On some bosses, sure, your pet didn't help much. But with proper micromanagement of your pet, you can keep him alive on most fights.
---
#**I don't care I just want my windfury!**
---
Yeah, WoW Classic is apparently dead already
---
Let's ignore the fact that
---
1. Not many people were invited.
---
2. It's 4 AM during the week (where people are sleeping or about to sleep in different timezones as normal people have to leave for work in the morning)
---
3. The progress is currently locked to level 40 and most people don't want to bother with gearing their character up seeing as the release is less than two months away.
---
Nope, I bet that has nothing to do with it at all.
---
A warrior can become ACTIVELY uncrushable through the use of Shield Block, adding 75% chance to block pushes crushing blows off the hit table, while the buff is active for the warrior.
---
Warriors also have more 'oh shit' buttons. Druids don't get last stand, or shield wall to finish out a fight, they also don't get a reliable way to break fears. Warriors will have a smoother "damage taken" curve if you look at it on a graph, where a druid will spike more, causing overhealing and sometimes be referred to as a "mana sponge" since he will generally take more healing to keep up throughout the fight. Warriors are much more consistent to heal.
---
But when do you have a chance to regenerate mana? What window of time will you not be casting for 5 whole seconds but also not be drinking? On a Priest it's awesome because wanding on a Priest is really good and you get 100% benefit from Spirit Tap etc
---
No. [From the man himself](https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=571).
---
i'm on patch 1.8 in the second screenshot doing green dragons
---
Oh, I admit I don't know a thing about layering. Perhaps I should learn more about it. Still hyped though.
---
[Two months maximum](https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=571).
---
[Ion said 2 months](https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=571).
---
I think you would be completely blown away by internet culture in 2004. Yes it’s toxic now but it’s *nothing* compared to what it was. I mean they don’t even resemble each other. It was so much worse before, and is unlikely to ever be that bad again—at least in first world countries.
---
People like this are the worst. Or those casters who will REEE if curse of elements isn't put on every trash mob the second combat starts god help you.
---
I feel like grinding beasts is faster then humanoids for leveling. Less packed and easier to kill.
---
Trap mastery is a relic from the dark ages when traps spell hit was based on the level you got the trap instead of the character level. It can not counter the 1% minimum resist chance either way
---
mongoose and counterattack can be used while you are disarmed, aka they do not factor weapon damage in. Mongoose is just a free dmg proc if it happens and counterattack is not something you pick up for dmg but for more control over physical dps classes
---
imp wing clip like any proc based crowd control effect has no DR with other crowd control effects post patch 1.9? which makes all of these talents very useful for pvp. (for the p-server crowd. yes that's a thing. A prime example is the 1.12 Ranger clip with two 5 sec duration wing clip roots within 9 seconds. of each other)
---
The main benefit is that your go-to attack when someone or something reaches melee range will be a raptor + a wing clip. The raptor is on the next hit so it is not affected by the global cooldown and the wing clip is your 'you are slowed ... and maybe rooted' option
---
On the Counterattack vs imp wing clip point. You can still root non melee dps with wing clip procs. Though counterattack is usually something people picked up back in the days to say F-U ret/enh/rogue/warrior - popping deterrence and brutalizing them just to add that final nail to the coffin with a unavoidable root when you are done and back off for ranged dps. Just keep in mind that - as a reactive proc - it does nothing for you vs casters for example.
---
Another boon is that - if you don't have a weapon chain - you can counter attack even while you are disarmed. 
---
Clever traps is and always has been useful (it became much more potent when you didn't have to spec into every trap individually) It turns frost trap into a freaking nightmare for everyone when you are specced into entrapment as the root dice roll happens on every pulse. It adds more time to subsequent crowd control on freeze
---
Makes sense! Thanks for the thorough explanation! This helped me to understand it better.
---
Also quite ethical and fun. It wasn't murder..it was just a suprise mechanism!
---
I don't have beta access so I'm stuck playing (redacted in fear of getting banned) right now. It sucks because I really want to plan around everything that will be in actual classic and not a close remade (redacted)
---
Has to happen.
---
Once you make it to 60 get prebis from dungeons, then wait around for aq20/zg pugs. They will be frequent on the weekends and only take maybe 2-3 hours. Grab all the gear from these raids then sit around until guilds have naxx on farm(so quite a while). Eventually guilds will start pugging AQ40 and maybe even naxx when the server is geared enough(if population doesnt drop).
---
He is saying because Mana Tide Totem isn't as good as WF so he is basically making melee worse while not making casters any better. I think
---
Priest had no AOE in TBC. He got mind sear in wotlk around level 75 i think ^^
---
What part of what I said was incorrect?
---
will we get the new sets when classic comes out next month? or do we have to wait for AQ?
---
I see, but then again how much time do you need to level cooking up to that point though ?
---
Also you've gotta stockpile most of the meat you come across to level it whereas skinning you can dump the skins everytime you get to a vendor.
---
I can see though how it can be productive to make money off cooking but I'm obviously not talking about cooking vs skinning as a singular choice, since you can do both for even more gold.
---
I'm mostly considering the time investment, since either way you're going to be grinding mobs and looting them , this can be subtracted from the time investment.
---
What I'm considering is the time difference between stopping whatever you're farming, going to a fire/making it then spending a couple of minutes chain crafting stuff in comparison to not stopping the grind and skinning , we're obviously not just talking about the skins you're making here, you're also missing out on exp and addition loot from killing the mobs at base.
---
We obviously also have to subtract the base vendor value of all meat from the revenue, if a single soothing turtle bisque sells for 3 silver on the vendor , a stack sells for 90 s but the meat vendors for 87 copper each, so that's 17.4 silver per stack, the overall profit is 72.6 silver. 
---
But we don't rly need to compare stacks, let's say you get 1 turtle meat per kill, so that's 87 copper, the cost of soothing spice is 1 silver 60 copper, so the overall cost of crafting soothing turtle bisque (not counting making a fire) is 2s 47 copper, so the profit of making a single bisque is :
---
3s - 2.47 = 53 copper .
---
The opportunity cost of walking away from a turtle to craft this would be :
---
53 -87 (turtle meat) = - 34 copper ( deficit).
---
This is considering the only thing a turtle can drop is meat and nothing else ( which isn't the case).
---
Then you add in the gain skinning a snapjaw turtle which has a 73% chance of giving you medium leather , a 20% chance of giving you heavy leather , a 5% chance for medium hide and a 2% chance for heavy hide.
---
Assuming you get the shittiest leather drop which is medium leather , a single medium leather vendors for 50 copper.
---
The total opportunity cost of walking away from a single snapjaw turtle to cook a single bisque is :
---
50 + 34 = 84 copper , you gain 84 more copper for continuing to grind and skin than to go and craft.
---
Considering cooking any recipe is typically 3 secs cast time it is the same time investment to stand and craft and to skin, so the cast time of both can be subtracted from the time investment.
---
Conclusion : Skinning is more time efficient and more profitable for that level range.
---
Because it serves no purpose?
---
Read my reply to the other post above.
---
&gt; Or even possible they would log out inside the dungeon before timer kicked them out and it would cause the instance to remain full for quite some time.
---
I know it's not that one. We used to have people logoff in raids, kick them, invite others, have them zone in, start a fight, and then the others would log back in, thus allowing us to have more than 40 people for a fight.
---
Then they fixed it so that if the instance ID you logged off inside was full, you'd log back in outside the instance and not be able to enter.
---
I really love KotH conversions. So good.
---
&gt;Seeing a flagged horde on a PvE server? Oh it's like Christmas morning, but with a huge pang of doubt in my head. Is he bait? Was he goaded into PvP? Did he kill some foolish Alliance who was flagged? What's the story here?
---
Funny how much that sounds like EVE
---
Those two statements are not contradictory. Matchups do not matter at all in the question "which class can beat which class", as the answer is any class can beat any other class with skill.
---
&gt;"sometimes"
---
Nothing about that contradicts a single thing I said. Are you aware that you automatically lose every argument where you resort to a strawman? Funny how you are backpedaling so hard, are you pretending you did not claim that "warrior should not be able to EVER beat a frost mage, that is how Classic should be"? Because that is what you claimed.
---
Warriors were able to beat frost mages in vanilla, therefore you are wrong. You clearly remember wrong or most likely never played vanilla and have no clue what the fuck you are on about. There were no hard counters to a degree where a class can never defeat a certain class.
---
Here's a dictionary page about you:
---
"retarded"
---
less advanced in mental, physical, or social development than is usual for one's age.
---
example: "the child is badly retarded"
---
I multiboxed 5 characters for a couple years on retail through legion/bfa. I got into it mostly for making gold, but I eventually started running m+ dungeons and found it to be a completely new level of challenge in a game where I am very rarely challenged by anything. 
---
I’ve been a hardcore player since vanilla only taking short breaks from the game a couple of times so for me the only challenge I really face in the game is working together with people of similar skill levels. But healing, tanking and dpsing dungeons simultaneously is hard as fuck and I find it extremely rewarding. 
---
Ive since evolved to multiboxing 40 accounts and in vanilla my ultimate goal is to fully clear BWL multiboxing.
---
Yeah, I don’t disagree with you. There are definitely mechanics that are technically harder. But when it comes to who can access those mechanics, and how just about anyone can see content, that’s where classic wins. The reason I think it’s harder is that you can’t just pug everything or LFG it. Your mistakes cost so much more and it’s much more rewarding, imo.
---
The "sit in" holding an instance hostage is only possible inside a raid instance. Had this happen in a few MC pugs on nost. We just reported them and thankfully a GM noticed quickly enough to sort it out before it became a big issue.
---
Sounds like a great idea. And indeed, it's beyond me as well. 12 euro is not even 30 minutes of work for me.
---
This thread people came up with posts saying: "the ONLY problem is X". Mean while people came up with 3 "X" problems.
---
1. ST Threat
---
2. Mana
---
3. Lack of taunt
---
I'm sure it'd be fine for leveling but after that I'm not sure I would recommend it.
---
I didn't play post cata launch. Has there ever been a helm that actually looks like this icon?
---
I actually really liked the beginning of it. 
---
SPOILERS
---
How they turned Jeremy's pro attitude towards working life, and it was a great (albeit a little heavy handed) commentary on how people play the "keeping up with the jones game". He thought he was pro at life because he was able to buy so much crap that he didnt even need.
---
I know it would be so great, him ranting about how he killed fiddy men! (or orcs lol)
---
You should honestly delete all your comments in this post. You clearly didnt play at the time. 
---
Everyone who got the head item from Onyxia will remember logging in with the BWL patch and having the new look.
---
Jesus christ I considered playing PvE but you just reminded me what kind of people play there
---
All good! Just wanted to clarify so that he didn't get to 60 linen and sit there confused why his enchanting didn't require 60 linen to make the wand. Hah
---
Which rogue abilities in classic do not break stealth?  I would assume something like sprint doesn’t, but as someone who has never played the original game, I wouldn’t be surprised if that were wrong.
---
I think they're going to be two different games and just co-exist. That is probably blizzards best intentions at the games cater to two different audiences.
---
This is what people usually forget... It's not "Fair pvp where two equal teams meet one another for combat"
---
It's usually a bunch of high levels farming grey level characters to feel better about themself.
---
&gt;  salty about everything that isn’t salt itself
---
We can fix that.
---
**Table salt &gt; Sea salt.** Come at me.
---
With current console hardware do you think classic wow will be able to run smoothly on it? Ps4 pro or the next gen ps5?
---
Blizzard would make a killing if they ported it to consoles. I have a bunch of friends that want to play it but hate. "AWD" as they call it.
---
So much arguing about when the models came out. The models were updated over time and not all at once. I remember specifically because I played warlock and it was one of the last to get an update which annoyed me at the time.
---
Good rebuttal kiddo.
---
The only reason that build took off on pservers is because people are bored as fuck and there is no need for MTT since all the bosses die so fast so they may as well squeeze in an extra 40 DPS. Back in the day MTT was huge because we weren't reclearing the same raids for 5 years with a full BiS group that has every imaginable buff and consumable.
---
Paladins do not have mana issues. No class in WoW (if you put in the effort) has mana issues.
---
I think he may be alluding to the fact that long-standing players can pick up side items (off-spec,pvp) over newer raiders main specs because they have so much more stored from repeated clears of content.
---
Call me old school but I pull websites or video on my other screens.
---
On average, Blizzard makes twice as much revenue from a Retail player as they do a Classic player. And that's not counting expansion sales. The sales of BFA in the first 24 hours already made more revenue than Classic ever will.
---
They want Classic players to play Retail. It's way too obvious and makes way too much sense.

This is constantly reiterated here again and again. Last time I leveled on a vanilla server around 90% of my pvp battles were pretty even. I pvp’d all the time while leveling and can’t even remember more than a couple times where someone was unfairly ganked. There were tons and tons of 1v1’s, 2v2s, 3v3s, and also 2v3s and 3v2s where everyone dies anyway. Maybe if you really have no idea what you’re doing it’s a miserable experience, but that *never* felt to be the case when I played.
---
You can get some pretty dope refurbished laptops for next to nothing nowadays
---
I also remember this, talk about cancer
---
At 60, if you actually decide to put in a large amount of effort and find a good guild, read guides, etc... you can main tank raids. 
---
I can't exactly speak for anything before 60.
---
That's because everyone on this sub is a rank 14 vanilla pvp master and certainly not a legion baby scrub wishing they were alive for vanilla...
---
Musta ran kara post WOTLK. Thanks!
---
no
---
&gt;600 people in tirisfal waiting on Samuel Fipp’s spawn
---
That's why i thought you play horde! hehehe.
---
I think horde and alliance have same issues on this topic :P
---
Ah alright. Fair point. Interesting though, I'd never heard of that system before. Thanks for sharing!
---
You are right a Holy paladin dps will deal more damage.
---
I gotta say... i really dig the old Transcendence, so goldy and shiny, you look like some damn sultan prince or something
---
Are they?  Seem more like immature shittters that want to just ruin other people's fun.  How can you say you are competitive when you run around and gank people 3 on 1 while they're trying to kill something?  Seems like the opposite of competitive to me...
---
Thanks for clearing it up. The video quality threw me off since I'm used to seeing 240p/360p videos from back then, and it wasn't common to use as many world buffs as this warrior did.  Things will definitely be different than they were in vanilla this time around from a meta perspective so it will be interesting to see how guilds progress and how classes spec.
---
People can play where ever they have the most fun, and people should let them be. Basic human respect 101.
---
Having said that this video imo made pvp look like way more fun
---
Back in the day they would rotate shaman out of melee groups and into caster or healer groups to drop mana totem. This maybe what's being referred to.
---
Ah yeah the Beta/Classic is clearly different than PS's values for xp as well as mob damage (under tuned) so yeah we'll have to see what state they release them in maybe farming with a efficient group would be more worthwhile then.
---
Is it a bad idea to take Tailoring if raiding is not in my plans? How much do I miss out not getting BoP recipes?
---
My plan is to go Orc Warlock and most likely Skinning/Herbalism and drop Skinning for Alchemy at 60, banking essential herbs to power level along the way. I'm tossing around going Tailoring/Enchanting for bags, gear, and wands though. 
---
These paths are pretty different because one essentially makes money while the other's a money pit.
---
I love T1 for mage...or for modern sunwell set and Nighthold from Legion
---
There is a differeance between offering an opinion on PVE servers versus PVP servers, and stating that an individual or group of individuals has an inferior preference.
---
&gt; But don't go around assuming your s doens't stink.
---
OP never did anything of the sort. He made it very clear in this post that he thinks playing on a PvP server and enjoying the aspects you just described is just as ok as playing on a PvE server. He just mentioned what he thinks to be advantages of playing PvE for his personal play style. So no need to get defensive.
---
Wow.....thats not right
---
I believe that Ragnaros will be downed within the first week.  
---
The gear and consumables required will be obtained by players who wont attend the actual raid, players will level to a specific level with a specific profession to farm a specific reagent to craft a specific consumable and send it to the players who are going to be in the raid.  
---
The players who will be in the actual raid will just focus on levling as fast as possible and then put a bit of effort into obtaining some gear when they're lvl 45+\~ (starting at Maraudon). The water needed to douse the runes arent a problem as one and the same player can just act as a courier and get another one right as he've used the current one.
---
They get booted if they get kicked from the group. They will be teleported outside the dungeon after 1 minute.
---
It's deeper than that. Even with infinite mana, something like Paladin tanking just isn't viable in raids. They had to completely overhaul the class in TBC to turn them into tanks.
---
There is a good chance he is dead before first week and second week several guilds will down him without a doubt.
---
The spec order at the top saves the AoE talents for last too. Might wanna do that earlier if you plan on AoE farming
---
Things will be a bit different than retail , there no flying mounts so you can't just escape easily or have some guy ambush you from the sky , but for the early levels untill you get to stranglethron vale the zones are faction specific , azeroth is massive it's not like an expansion which is just a tiny island where both horde and alliance share the same zones.
---
Microcenter has some decent deals on lower-end gaming laptops.  Honestly, anything with a 2gb or greater gpu will handle Classic.  Would definitely recommend getting something with a solid state drive as well.  Lower end laptops tend to have horribly slow HDD’s.  My guess is that you could get away with spending anywhere from $500 to $700 depending on where you look.
---
.. ? He's talking about the beta, Classic releases in two months.
---
The trailer doesn't actually prove that the new models dropped, considering how much Blizzard messed up back then. At the very least it doesn't prove that the old pieces that had already dropped in MC were converted to the new ones.
---
First of all, I would say it is unlikely that 29 days was a record even back then. And yes, that will be shattered with classic. There are pserver guilds aiming for a first lockout kill, that would be within 7 days. They may or may not hit that, but they'll definitely hit it within the second week. At the absolute max I'd give him 9 days from release to world first, but I'm of the opinion that a first week kill will happen.
---
Lezárult már, május környékén volt. Én amúgy még nemtom, de valószínű PVE-re, mert a privát szerverek mind PVP-k és fos az egész.
---
Itt van amúgy maga a cucc: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG-IgC4caAaRJEpKqv29YWtomnV6xjkQvNqaFtsfX1oHpb8Q/viewform?usp=embed_facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR33XJkThdSZ0_IdHlx-t8_ftupGnaVovrdAQSMK-IIqFMOPWJecXTcjemE
---
&gt; Ion said ~2 months for the first 2 phases.
---
He said, if he have to ball park it, a couple of months. Sorce: Your video.
---
Yep same issues in both sides. i think all alliance races have their unique mob or object to grind, and same tagging hard times...
---
No difference at all. :)
---
Sword and board
---
Sunder armor
---
Revenge
---
Taunt when stuff gets peeled from you
---
Shield bash casters when they are targeting you with a cast-time spell
---
Yeah, farming either grey, or "just barely green" level characters while they wait for their battleground queues to pop. This made leveling from 48-60 a living hell on Nostalrius. All the leveling zones for that area were camped by the opposing faction.
---
It'll be pretty interesting to see a guild try to rush him. The biggest issue is getting the rep for the Aqual Quintessence.
---
You mean his post that started with basically "In reaction to all the people shitting on people who like PVE servers"
---
A response counts as "instigating it" to you?
---
AraTHEE HOCKlann is how I pronounced that.
---
Wasn’t it confirmed that battle shout doesn’t generate threat in the beta though? I could be wrong I just felt like I heard that somewhere
---
As someone who played a rogue for all of TBC, this sentence resonates with me. 
---
I don't care how your class works just put down the thing that gives me more deeps!
---
I'm planning on leveling Paladin deep ret and then going into holy once I have repentance. I have a few questions about gear whilst leveling.
---
Say I have mail shoulders with no stats and a quest gives me cloth shoulders with intellect and stamina should I be swapping the mail for the cloth?
---
Is it okay to level with leather and cloth pieces or is the armour bonus from mail and plate more important?
---
I saw a guide saying the stat priority while leveling is Str=Agi &gt; Stam &gt; Int &gt; Spirit. How would I weight these stats for example how many times greater is str/agi than stamina or intellect?
---
How are those affected by people prefering and rolling PvE servers?
---
No it is not.
---
Melee leeway was a thing in Vanilla. What Classic has is not leeway, it's entirely something else.
---
In Vanilla if you queued up a skill, the swing happened and if a mage blinked the mage would still get hit by that skill. There was no permanent range increase.
---
brag post lol
---
Just curious, but what was your time? I got server first with ~11.5 hours myself. Mostly everything you said matches with what I did, including the full quest log prior to release and the brief visit to Uldum to pad XP to get to Twilight Highlands (most of the quests suck so you had to cherry pick the fast ones).
---
The only difference is that I just stuck it out in Hyjal. I even got on 45 minutes late due to the login server being uncooperative, but I was third at 82 and first at 83 regardless. The advantage just grew from there. I did however have full knowledge of all quests thanks to being in the beta, and was on a medium population server. IIRC it took like 3 hours before someone else hit 85, so the competition was no doubt notably less than on the large servers.
---
[That's the AQ shield](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19321/the-immovable-object)
---
Uh, no. First of all, you are incorrectly presuming how old I am (unless you are just trying to be a troll, thus providing an example which proves my point). Second, just one example to illustrate my point: swatting.
---
You mean Himalayan? Hard to argue with that, but it's so expensive.
---
Can we quit with this bickering and realize that there are numerous different types of DKP systems and Loot Councils?
---
And perhaps discuss those variations and compare their pro &amp; cons instead?
---
That's not the biggest issue. That takes a couple of hours of AoE farming.
---
The biggest issue is leveling.
---
Yeah but people like you will cry for a short phase 2 though.
---
I was able to find a Horde one who was advertising on the Blizzard forums. I'm sure there's other ones out there, and I bet more will pop up after the first few weeks when more people start hitting 60.
---
They have no friends.
---
You're not seeing everything though. There's different mechanics and loot(not just statistically) from LFR. If you leave, come back, and do LFR, you're no more caught up than if you did 5-mans. It can even be avoided all together, heroic dungeon gear is more than viable for normal raids. What it does is sort out the riff raff from normal+ raids.
---
These pvp whiners aren't competitive!  They seem more like immature shittters that want to just ruin other people's fun. How can you say you are competitive when you run around and gank people 3 on 1 while they're trying to kill something? Seems like the opposite of competitive to me... There is no challenge in ganking someone with an overwhelming advantage, because you can't lose. Thus no sense of fun or accomplishment from overcoming that challenge. The only sense of fun you get is by knowing you ruined someone elses' fun. If that is how you have fun, then you aren't competitive, you are immature.
---
You literally just admitted I’m right.  Both layering and sharding are there for population control.
---
This^ but that is Nucky Thompson :&gt;
---
WRONG.
---
If a mob dies within 30 seconds it's not even worth the global or mana.
---
Also if you want to min/max your damage on trash its best to start a pull with a pre-casted shadowbolt while the tank is pulling because when you go from a casted spell to an instant cast you shave time off your global cd thanks to spell queueing. (you use addons to see when your cast is almost finished and cancel it 0.2-0.5 seconds early and the cast still goes off)
---
On a boss you need to wait for tank threat anyway so you don't lose anything cursing immediately. on trash hardly ever is it worth unless you're fighting a beefy mob that will be up for awhile.
---
Even five seems small after that, how many servers did wow have in its prime vanilla days? Must of been at least 50 for Europe alone.  It's going to be layered forever.
---
Not bragging about anything, just sharing my vanilla experiences and starting a discussion about what the record will be with thousands of people pushing it instead of only a handful in comparison.
---
I'm thinking that threat plates with a mouse-over sunder would be really helpful. I'm going to try that in Classic.
---
Thank you so much for the support, enjoy it!! &lt;3
---
Yes they are, search for them.
---
I'm excited to start playing on a PvE server, but mainly because PvP has never appealed to me. On the off chance that I do feel like doing some PvP, I can hop in a battleground when they get released and not have to deal with the frustration and time wasting potential that World PvP is 80% of the time. The other 20% of the time can be amazing, but with my limited play time it is hard to justify having fun only 20% of the time.
---
&gt;you can main tank raids
---
It's really, really difficult. I mained a prot paladin in vanilla, and TBC was like mana from heaven because it was so, so much easier to tank with a proper toolkit and TBC-level gear.
---
The problem with main tanking in raids is that paladins can't avoid crushing blows, and they don't have the armor or HP pool of a bear druid to just soak those hits. Paladins couldn't avoid crushing blows until we had access to epic level 70 gear.
---
Paladins can offtank in raids and are great offtanks versus undead. Main tank is a tough ask.
---
But he puts points into quickly summoning VW for the shield for PvP. Sure, having your walker up all the time is another shield but still, as long as you're in a 1v1 you can win most of the fights. Either way, I intend to level in a group with 2 friends anyways so I don't really expect to deal with too many gankers since few people want to fight a group of 3.
---
It's ok, you will have enough people (all 10 per server) to role play and do whatever you care bears do, other than raid of course enjoy playing a DED server lel
---
dps? paladins are healers
---
Name checks out
---
 That's not the biggest issue. That takes a couple of hours of quest farming.
---
The biggest issue is having 40 players doing it at the same pace.
---
\#CopyPaste
---
Don’t sell yourself short, it was a very galaxy brain move
---
I don't think I personally am gonna touch retail. If WoW Classic eventually gets killed, then I'm kinda OK with that. I think I will stop playing before it ends, but, things can't last forever anyway.
---
I'm just going to enjoy my time while it last and play the original game with my buddies who quit throughout the years.
---
At the time, we posted in multiple new servers' forums to see if anyone had bested the time and could not find any confirmation of it.  I just don't think rushing Rag was much of a thing back when we did it.  I agree the (assumed) record will be broken, just wondering by how much.
---
To each their own.
---
That’s because none of us have beta access
---
Welcome to Vanilla, where stats matter more then armor, and BIS has nothing to do with armor type.
---
TBH, there doesnt need to be a beta. 
---
They should just shut it down and internally test the rest.
---
Danger already exists in form of the environment / mobs. What you're describing is artificial extra danger. 
---
And being unable to progress any further with your character, knowing the only reason for that is that another player from the other faction with his level 60 decided so, is absolutely immersion breaking to me. 
---
I rolled PvP back in the day. Some may like it, but to me personally, it did absolutely nothing to create some bond with my character, it only made me regret my wasted time.
---
I will multibox tank + healer and just inv random dps for dungeons. Might do dps + healer aswell.
---
They can afford it. They just think the server will be too niche and therefore underpopulated, and dead soon after launch. I want an RPPvP server too.
---
Your post and the one you replied to really shows how little some people in here know of retail. Or wow in general.
---
I lol’d
---
Who said every raider needs to be an engineer?
---
This was our issue, getting 40 people to commit that kind of time back when streaming wasn't a job option and there was no real incentive to do so.  We were just a random group of people with a lot of time on our hands that all gave up our mains we had spent a year raiding with and gearing up to start fresh.
---
Enchance is only a meme spec if you take it to purely DPS, but if you play a supporting role for the raid it is viable.
---
Less victims I guess :D?
---
hopefully phase 1, the retarded layer phase will be less than a week.
---
Cause fuck layering.
---
This has been discussed a million times, we will only know the realm list when we can make our characters 2 weeks before launch.
---
Stop asking stupid questions like "which EU server will be the German server" or "Which server streamers will play on". No one can answer that when we don't have a list of servers and we won't until Aug 13.
---
I purposely mentioned "round robin" as a checker to make sure the same guy isn't getting gear repeatedly (excluding MT/OT).
---
Each guild needs to have a system that works and caters for them, I was just giving an example for OP.
---
you can learn english in 90 minutes with this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9SL2TuxC38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9SL2TuxC38)
---
retard it tells you who the mob is attacking.
---
The shield I just found out about. Holy moly that thing is NICE. That alone would push me towards Eng at 60 if I was going to be tanking a lot (which let's face it, as a warrior you probably are, even if you're pure dps specced). What are the other aoe options? Grenades?
---
So weird. Mine is showing 640x1138. File name: xzcmhlf_d.jpg
---
I dont think thats what OP was going for
---
I remember Tyrs hand? was the place to be when it came to farming then it got nerfed.
---
I remember this was a thing in FFXI since you can switch gear regardless of combat status. But the little bit extra isn't worth it if you get aggro'd while resting and not be able to switch back to normal gear. Also have to take into consideration the stat differences that will change after you swap gear. You will need to then rest again from the Int / Sta gains from putting your regular gear back on. Unless you really stack on the Spirit the difference isn't going to be very noticeable IMO.
---
But people are still willing to defend it because it's "Fun" and "The Game is called World of Warcraft for a reason" or "Why don't you go to a PVE server then?" 
---
Yet the moment you go to a PVE Server to avoid bullshit like that they start attacking you for that, meaning you can't win with the Toxic Part of the PVP Crowd.
---
People need to chill the fuck out, realize that it's a Video Game and that there's something like taking Faction pride way too far. 
---
You are not killing bots, you are killing other players over and over again for absolutely no gain. Talk about wasting your time.
---
Cooldowns and ability to tank every single encounter. You could use MT druid for most of the content easily though if you so wanted.
---
A DKP system with no logical rules, ones as simple as main spec gear over offspec/alts, is sure to be a disaster. However, I'd be surprised anyone would willing raid with a group using such a flawed DKP system.
---
then wait till you're home and reply to me then. it's an old song.
---
Hey, would you be interested in joining my guild &lt;From Ashes&gt;? We are rolling Horde side on a PVP server and focus on semi-hardcore raids, leveling together, community, and having a good time. We'd love two new additions to the ranks. 60 signups for classic and counting! DM me for where we're at right now. :-)
---
I played Vanilla.
---
What’s the difference in a role-playing server? I’ve never played on one. What’s it like?

These aren't BOP though right? You can just feed a single engineer the mats and they can mass craft them can't you?
---
I 100% don't see a problem with this. If someone wants a larger upgrade and doesn't see worth in a smaller or moderate upgrade. Holding onto DKP is part of the reason if not the MAIN reason it's even the system people use.
---
You have got to be kidding me.
---
Seriously. Re read the comment. Tell me how it is "directed" at *anyone*on this sub, or even a real person.
---
Hey man its just that im with Kenny Loggins
---
Both of these videos were uploaded in recent years and not 2005, so nobody knows if the kills actually happened back then. Funny how nobody in this thread was was able to post a video which is actually from 2005 and features the reskinned sets, while every legitimate screenshot and video from 2005 shows the old sets.
---
Hardcore Vanilla guilds.
---
Gnomish Engineers get "Gnomish Battle Chicken", which is a battle pet (not like in retail, its a pet that attacks shit) that does 1 damage every 2 seconds but occasionally "squawks" increasing the attack speed of your party by 5% for 5 minutes. That and the AoE grenades/bombs I think are the majority of why the try-hard chads want every single person to be an engineer.
---
&gt;  I don't see a reason why I would use it while leveling up.
---
Thank you for you perspective and the time you took to share it.
---
It doesn't matter as this is for PVE, and outside of 5 mans you will not be raiding as Elemental.
---
Oh sure, found it on a guide website, but ill link the sources including you.
---
That might be what I do. Then work on a gathering alt. That's what I did in TBC, will just have to make the alt a priority once I'm raid ready on main.
---
Nope, You need engineering skill to use the bombs/grenades
---
What’s the difference in those servers?  How do they play differently?
---
&gt;  The biggest issue is getting the rep for the Aqual Quintessence.
---
Nah, that's at most a couple hours clearing MC trash you can reset over and over.
---
It's an effort of about 130 people dedicated to getting 40 people a week-one Ragnaros kill.
---
There's a guy whose only job it is to get to level 25 and fish for a week to make as many Fire Protection Potions as he can.
---
There are about 20 people whose only job is to get a Warlock to level 20 and position them in key places, including the island with Dukee Hydraxis. And another 40 people that will be parking level 1 alts at those locations too. Their goal is to ensure the team never has to take a long flight path or zeppelin.
---
There's another even larger group of tank+healer+warlock sets that will rush to a certain level, grab all the quests for a key dungeon (without turning them in), and then run it over and over until no one in the raid team needs it.
---
Every single raid team member will be able to afford all of their skills and the largest bags available and their mounts right at level 40 and anything else they need without taking a single profession (except First Aid of course).
---
Almost everyone in the raid team has ~100 hours /played to 60 times on a private server tuned with beta data that's running bots to simulate launch day congestion (even ganking) and ~40 hours /played to 40 on the beta itself. And that's without the support staff listed above.
---
The main tank, one healer, and three DPS will be level 60 before Friday night, giving them more than 2 days to get key pieces of end-game dungeon gear.
---
It's going to be amazing.
---
Do you expect to not get ganked while leveling up??? Why do you think I keep mentioning a pve server..... I don't get it man.  Are you playing on a pve server or not?
---
Köszi szépen, PvE én is.
---
I love the arrogance, to think you're special enough that you should post about this as if we are required to prove it to you specifically.
---
well phase one will obviously be more than one week but yeah I hope they remove layering long before phase one is over
---
Wrong. 
---
Layers are not meant to alleviate the beginner rush. You will have the exact same experience as if it was suddenly 2005 and 3k people all landed in the same world. North shore will still have 500 people killing wolves.
---
Layers alleviate only the tourist attrition issue, and still open the doors up to exploitation. Tourist attrition could take anywhere from 3-4 weeks to two months during which layers will remain active.
---
Ive been playing on a private PvP server while waiting for Classic, and while i have loved the leveling experience overall, the big negative has been the amount of ganking.
---
STV was easily the worst, but 1k Needles around the raceway was pretty bad, and Hillsbrad was pretty bad too.  Constantly attacked by either groups of Alliance or by high level players, and for no reason.  I would be happily going about questing, minding my own business, then bam, stabbed/shot/spelled in the back, and cue another corpse run.  
---
Tbh I just dont understand the mentality. I don't really understand why it is fun to attack someone else who doesn't want to be attacked. And I really don't understand it when it comes to gank squads or high level players picking on solo/lowbie players.  Is it just some wierd form of overcompensation? 
---
So I will be playing on a PvE server.  If I want to PvP I can join a BG or flag myself.  And if I don't want to, I don't have to.
---
Shadow Priests didn't have major mana issues, they had damage issues (and debuff slot issues). I've seen the 25% figure thrown about, that isn't "25% lower damage" that is only 25% of the top tier's damage.    
---
Their damage increased in BC thanks to higher debuff slots and a new DoT. But it didn't matter as much by then since Blizzard gave them actual utility thanks to being "mana batteries" (VT).   
---
Hybrids shouldn't do the damage of a full DPS class. To be viable they needed to bring utility, and in Classic the utility was lacking, damage was too low (even if designed to be *lower*), and some had mana issues or key abilities missing (like Prot Paladin's lack of taunt).
---
Can you link me the guide please?
---
Thank you
---
Yeah there’s definitely more policing now, I get that. But the actual volatility of content and just general toxicity are way worse,in my experience, now than say 2004-05
---
I am skeptical...
---
ive been hurt before...
---
This is me 100%
---
I started on PvP but later changed to PvE once the Sunwell patch dropped in TBC. End games zones just get too annoying if you end up on a server with a population imbalance  (for whatever side is smaller). To avoid that I'm just going to start on PvE most likely.
---
You need the profession to use them though.
---
You need a certain lvl of engineering skill in order to use them.
---
You sound like a great fit for my guild &lt;From Ashes&gt;. Horde side NA on a PVP server! We are at 60 signups and counting with a good mix of newbs and veterans. DM me here or my discord is Frumie#3810. We'd love to help you out and have you as part of the crew, bud, don't hesitate to give me a shout for deets.
---
same, just can't decide.
---
If I may share some thoughts about a few things :
---
\- Improved drain soul was theory-crafted and tested extensively and the final verdict was that it's not worth it.
---
For starters some people might miss this due to the way the talent is worded but you need to be the one to actually get the killing blow for it to activate, your pet doesn't count as you either, so not only do you need to pull the pet back everytime before the mob dies but no one else must help out, once you're in a group this talent becomes almost useless.
---
The regen gained is heavily affected by spirit, gear priority for lock while leveling isn't spirit based mostly since you prioritize stamina/spell power and intellect before spirit, the only way to get actual benefit from this talent is to gear for spirit first which gimps your survivability on pvp servers.
---
Demonic embrace reduces total spirit which gimps the regen from improved drain soul.
---
Casting drain soul stops the 5 sec rule for mana regen which you would be benefiting from by simply frontloading your dots and then wanding , which is a solid way of sustaining your mana pool when combined with life tap.
---
Bag space overload due to incredible high amounts of soul shards.
---
If you insist on going with drain soul you must  make a soul shard macro to delete shards everytime you drain or you won't have space to loot anything, you would also have to skip demonic embrace so as to not gimp your spirit and prioritize spirit on gear.
---
This method of leveling/gearing is very functional on pve servers due to no wpvp , but on pvp realms this is no longer efficient enough as you'll be too squishy to fight anyone.
---
\- Threat management and dots:
---
If you are leveling with a voidwalker , using all 4 dots ( immo,corr,agony,siphon ) and wanding will pull aggro off your pet.
---
Spreading siphon life on more than 1 target will generate incredible amounts of threat due to double dipping ( damage and healing threat ), your pet won't be able to generate enough treat to catch up.
---
Siphon life is incredibly mana inefficient and would only be worth using if the mob will survive it's full duration.
---
\- Drain life and improved drain life:
---
Using drain life to heal yourself while leveling is incredibly inefficient, both mana cost and healing return is abysmally low.
---
The spell should only be used when you are close to death and really need to survive some form of disaster where efficiency is not your direct concern. This means that using drain life to top yourself after mobs isn't going to help. The amount of mana consumed per life gained would only end up in you having to life tap to get the mana back which would bring you back to square one, it would take several full casts of drain life + life tapping to get anywhere near full hp and mana ,this would also mean you cannot dot anything while draining so as to not pull aggro off pet because a single hit from a mob would negate the benefit of a full drain ( spell pushback and mana wasted ), in that regard it is often preferable to just fear a mob that is in ur face and bandage to full rather than face tank. Also eating/drinking to top urself is faster than drain/tapping.
---
Improved drain life is too insignificant with 0 spell power, it only becomes decent after you have above 200-300 shadow damage, while leveling a maxed out ( 5/5) improved drain life would only grant you 7 addition health per tick, a total of 35 health increase at max drain life rank ( rank 6 ), it's significantly lower at lower ranks to the point where you might as well put those points anywhere else so as to not waste them.

The burden of proof is on you
---
Is that a fact or an assumption?

For dps, it obviously increases your dps, especially on aoe pulls.

Seems broken but we need video evidence of how blizzard work, would be really nice if some people were given access to the original 1.12 client, or blizzard tested these for us.
---
Amen, brother!  Carebear for life, here.  PvE all the way.
---
Thank you, that's a great answer, that 5% boost is huge.
---
Most of the guilds I see recruiting for Classic are Loot Council...and personally I can't understand it at all. I assume most never actually played Vanilla, that's the only explanation.
---
Loot Council works better the smaller your player roster is. For the 10-man and 25-man focused guilds of later expansions, it's a very good system. Everyone knows everyone, and conflicts over loot can be easily discussed.
---
It will not work in Classic for 40-man raids. There are simply too many people to keep track of, and too much loot is shared by multiple classes. I think people are forgetting how much work it is to keep track of 50 people and keep them motivated enough to show up each week to raids. LC will inevitably breed bias, and that in turn will drive people away from attending.
---
Sure, a lot of players wouldn't touch Retail in its current state. But a *mostly* clean slate wipe with the ability to transfer your level 60 characters over to a new expansion with a level 70 cap that has many compromises between Classic and Retail to bolster both playerbases?
---
Yeah, that's a game a lot of Classic players would jump on.
---
An empty spot is also viable.
---
Fake News Gang Stokes Media Hate. Of course people have to go and bring their politics into every single sub.
---
It's almost as if you only read the title of the post but didn't read the post itself.
---
Fascinating!
---
I can definitely see how a few people would view the 'he performed better because of gear outlook'.
---
The hope and goal is to have a solid LC in place that knows that difference and generally how much dps difference they should have relative to their gear. I think mainly the point he was getting at is, if someone has the requisite items but is STILL pulling paltry damage. You don't want to reward them necessarily with that item upgrade. Hopefully, you have had a Class Leader talk with them about rotation etc. and hope that their dps get's that needed bump before than giving the reward for solid performance.
---
So much misinformation in whatever you seem to say in this subreddit. How can anyone take you seriously?
---
Thank you, that makes more sense.
---
I've debated back and forth on what server type to play on. I originally played on a pve server, then switched to horde shaman on pvp server. I had a lot more fun on the pvp server. Problem is, I know that time is gone. The new prated server meta is cancerous as fuck. I am not sure I am interested in a bunch of no life virgin losers running around camping lowbies, and running around in gank squads.
---
Shit used to be a lot more honorable back in the day. Fair fights. Corpse camping was basically unheard of. Sometimes we would kill a lowbie if we saw him, but you never took it too far. It wasn't about completely ruining someone elses' sense of enjoyment out of the game, which is what pvp servers have become now.
---
I am not an immature sociopath, and don't get enjoyment out of other people's suffering. That's why I will play on a pve server this time.
---
*Points at undead rogue sneaking around IF* 
---
She doesn’t even go here!
---
I love stuff like that.
---
Sapper charges are another main one. incredible for pvp and pve.
---
This is something getting peddled around on WoWhead's guides a lot too. It's baffling to me.
---
Gonna be a lot of people following these guides running around in +Spirit gear wondering why half the stuff they fight takes so long to die. 
---
But hey, at least they'll regen faster once they eventually kill the mob.
---
It's optimal because Goblin Sapper Charges deal considerable damage on demand. Imagine 40 raiders all blowing them at once; it's 18-30k AoE burst damage, which helps power through difficult boss phases and add spawns.
---
I support this :)
---
Thank god more invites are going out. Beta is a ghost town.
---
It roughly takes at minimum 120-140 hour to level to max level if you optimize things (yes I know it could be done faster with perfect condition but let's assume conditions won't be perfect with other people competing for mobs and maybe server downtime)
---
If we assume people not sharing account and not playing more than 16-18hours/day (which is obviously already far more than healthy) it will take at least a week to have 40 people at level 60 (and probably more like 9 days) 
---
When people are lvl60, it will go fast, one/two day of instance farming will be enough to gather enough gear/consumable to be able to have enough gear to down Rag in my opinion.
---
So my estimate is around 220-240 hours after server launch without people sharing account
---
If leeway goes, I think "running through casters" should be looked at.  It seems running through the center of the caster's model doesn't cancel the cast.  It is like the source of the spellcast is behind their player model, and that's what you have to run through.
---
well i was wondering "how viable" so sounds like some what viable
---
first of all you misunderstood what i'm talking about.
---
when people say server population they are talking about how many are online at a time. I.e. the number that appears when you do a /who request.
---
Where is the source of how you think it worked?  If you're just going off of memory then there is no argument to be had.
---
class* :0
---
A 5cap AB is about 2minutes long. And its easier for a Bracket 1 premade to impose a win when they don't have to deal with PUG players or organizing Bracket 2 groups into their farm. It is much harder to guarantee a smash in AV than in AB; so perhaps I should have said more reliable rather than just faster.
---
Edited in the message above :) also in the souces in the top coment
---
It's a joke.
---
What are you gonna do about it?
---
I really like that you put time into the details. Great job on the clipping sword :)
---
it is the best option but in no way is it mandatory 
---
My guild recommends it but in no way requires it
---
Only high-level players would be pinned to their layer. If you invite a low-level player to a group, they’re switched into Layer 1 with you.

PvE is lame af
---
If you're going to make a claim like that, I'm going to need quotes with what you consider misinformation. And not a single one of them should be opinions you simply disagree with.
---
I'm 99.9% sure Classic WoW PvP servers will be much more toxic than any private server. Just reading the responses of some of the pro-PvP server people in here all but confirms that. They are people who take joy in knowing that they directly caused another human negative emotions or suffering. That's pretty much the definition of toxic.
---
Mana is an issue in pvp too.
---
As a paladin main I liked the paladin one.. just not in that color. The orange PvP version looked way better. At least as a non-draenei.
---
But yeah you're right, that tier slapped. Priest, warlock, mage, warriors pretty good, even druids looked real nice in a good understated way (rogues a lil dewritos and hunters nothing special tho).
---
Absolutely nothing, I couldn't give two shits about you or this post, doesn't change the fact that it's laughable at best. Don't get so mad over a game, kind of worrying I can only imagine how you are when your pet or significant other does something you don't agree with.
---
15k online in world chat, its gonna feel like nost
---
Did forums and discord suddenly cease to exist?
---
Look up pay to win. It required a lot more skill to multibox a dungeon than regular party from what I am reading. 
---
Meaningful playthrough..... For whom?
---
That's the exact problem I've had with DKP in the past. Some people just have SO much dkp built up and if proper rules aren't in place, it's hard if not impossible for new players or even semi-established players to pick up off-set pieces, pvp pieces or even main spec pieces.
---
This can be even worse if guilds allow the transfer of dkp to alts if their main doesn't need anything from a specific raid tier.
---
So I haven’t played WoW in like 6 months,
---
Just logged in and saw that I can download classic. And it’s currently downloading. 
---
Does that mean I’ve been given access or do I still need a key?
---
Completely agree with this.  It's like some sort of compensation for having a shitty irl or something.  
---
I played on a PvE server from Vanilla through Wrath and there was actually loads of PvP competition between the factions, but it was limited to BG's and the occasional massive world raid on Orgrimmar or Stormwind.  The best bit was everyone knew each other across factions so there were little personal rivalries too. And when Arena rolled out and BG's etc. all became x-realm it was amazing how many players were highly ranked, so the standard was good too.  It just wasnt random ganking or wPvP.
---
That’s not the biggest issue. Its whether or not you can keep 40 players active from not passing out from the stench of their hot pocket fueled poop socks.
---
This community doesn't understand sarcasm.
---
Salzman, from accounting
---
Minimum is about 90 hours. With practice you can easily get 120 hours (our recruiting cutoff for the raid team). With practice and support, 100 hours is right.
---
Kid I leveled up on the PvP-BetaServer. 99% of your time you are fighting PvE-Enemies.
---
I’m really not ready to believe the “its too niche” stuff, especially PR coming from a public corp. Every blue post goes through multiple sets of eyes before you see it, and multiple revs to maintain their messaging.
---
There’s a large player base asking for it on reddit, which is only a portion of the actual player base. The decisions are made around timing, costs, and ROI. If player satisfaction or, “playability” routes to one of those base-drivers, sure, they will work within the players’ interests. There’s a large enough interest to support an RP-PvP server, for sure. And if it dies? Well it dies. Oh, unless the goal here is to ensure long-term subs, which would be a cost-driven goal. You see my point here?
---
They are effectively making megaservers, rather than keeping it to a 3K pop cap with queues. Thats the game. Part of the game was a pop cap, and you had to wait in line to join the world, not some weird system of fading into the mist every time you group with friends from across the continent. They could host several realms on one server with the tech available today, and could make merging servers really fast and easy with some proactive work.
---
This guy knows how to level
---
That's argand joke you made there!
---
You need exactly 1 person who can port and be summoned back for each rune.
---
This is great! Would love to see one for warriors and weapon progression.
---
To you.
---
I've played on both and they have their perks. It's really fun ganking someone, but it's also nice to cruise around and quest without any risk at all.
---
Thanks for clearing it up lol I was pretty confused
---
So you claim to that I post misinformation but don't have a single quote of mine to prove it? The only troll here is you.
---
IDK, I can't really see that happening.  Why would a 60 camp a lowbie forever?  I've been playing on a private server leveling, and obviously you do die, but I have yet to be repeatedly camped by anyone.
---
Questie does a pretty good job of this as well.  I'm playing Horde right now and have no idea where any quests are since I never played them during my WoW years.  Questie started showing me one off quests that I passed up originally in my run thru the Barrens.  
---
I'm a completionist like you I'm assuming.  Questie helps with my OCD in this area.
---
nothing in my email yet... ; ;
---
Lol ok.  Hope that works out for you on live.  Don't buy immolate and come crying to these forums when you can't level through STV.
---
Unless your horde, generally the 7 fury warriors are going to be dual wielding. In which case, the 2h will almost 100% be a PvP item. In my experience when that is the case, the weapon choice would take generally 2 things into account.
---
1.) Time with guild/Performance in Raids - generally I think of them the same.
---
2.) PvP rank or time spent PvPing.
---
That can eliminate a lot of the other warriors that may just want it as a vanity item or will "Start pvping once I have a good 2-hander". I'm going to need proof that you actually will use the item.
---
So if 1-3 of those warriors cover those 2 things, it generally, in my opinion, goes to a roll. Unless say all three cover #1. But for #2 you have a rank 6 and a rank 8. And the third warrior is r10-11, I'd rather hand it off to the third guy if he's planning on pushing for 11-14. Or even if he just sits on that and still pvps.
---
There really isn't any particular problem.
---
Holding aggro on a single target is difficult, and running out of mana each pull is a pain -- but its absolutely doable in 5 mans.
---
The only real issue of viability is how patient your group is compared to a warrior or even a decently geared druid. What would take a normal tank group an hour to run an instance would probably take 2 with a paladin tank.
---
We don't talk about shaman tanks b/c that is truly meme tier.  Better off taking a soul like warlock at that point.
---
Can't add more. 
---
Obviously the beta is dead and tbh, it should be closed at this point.
---
No need to raise the lvl cap. 
---
What was supposed to be tested was tested.
---
thing is  resto can do all of that support
---
(aside from imporved windfurry) and heal very well
---
It's really great having both spirit gear and regular gear and using outfitter to swap between them.  It's like eating while running to the next mob or eating while you're eating.  /Sit works well with it too if you don't feel like eating.
---
Oh, I peed a little instead /flee
---
Not a bad option. Sounds pretty solid.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=10646
---
Im not 100% sure I want meme specs to go away 
---
most of them have a niche somewhere in game
---
So you're saying people queue up, then take a flight path to leveling zones to gank, then after the BG do it again?  Seems silly.
---
Sap does. You have to have it talented which even then has a 10% chance of failing and I recommend no one take that talent because there's way more important shit in the subtlety tree to take.
---
Other examples of things that don't break it are poisons and the only relevant racial I can think of, like the only one you might want to actually want to use in stealth, perception.
---
after level 40 you realize pvp is a chore. once the novelty of pvp wears off and you realize that it hardly amounts to anything, most people dont pvp much. not saying it doesnt exist at higher levels, but its just a lot less common
---
Is there a shaman one of these out yet?
---
Players can get away with or do a lot of stuff in Classic. The only real issue is that there are much better/easier ways about it.  
---
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
---
You can also BoP whoever pulls aggro. Maybe save HoJ for melee who pull, and BoP for casters.
---
Yes I did. Thank you for pointing that out.
---
How did the image get so much smaller between reposts?

Level 50 warlock, level 60 (??) warrior charges me, double resist on fear -&gt; zerk rage -&gt; coil + curse of exhaustion -&gt; 30+ yards range, that warrior spent a little while being corpes camped after that.
---
id say DKP is more like capitalism. Everyone doesnt have the same salary--some people have better attendance than others. And everyone acting in their own self interest hurts the group as a whole (disenchanted loot that wasnt bid upon).
---
loot council is exactly the same amount of fair as your loot council is wise and honorable. 
---
So it could be a communist utopia or it could be stalinism
---
Awesome research
---
Engineering is required
---
Hahaha what. That's one very strange bug. Absorb shields should also benefit from armour.
---
lol, yes.
---
I remember watching a vid a few years back on maintaining threat as a Pally tank, and the guy was periodically spamming flash heal on himself as Righteous Fury generates threat on Holy spells.  This was demonstrated in the early 20's in the Deadmines so there wasn't anything really complicated going on.  Seemed pretty effective and I never hear anybody talk about it as a way for Pally's to maintain threat outside of Consecrate.
---
That's how I've seen most LC's. People link their gear for that item slot. Generally, all things being equal for the players, the biggest upgrade would get the item. But if it's a medium upgrade for a core raider vs a massive upgrade for a 2-4 week new raider, I'd think the core guy would still be the item.
---
People pretend to actually be their character and speak like they would, instead of talking like a person playing a game.
---
No. You can only get one Aqual Quintessence per week. The Eternal Quinessence at Revered has a 1 hour cooldown, so that's also not an option.
---
Did... Did he just run in there?
---
Unfortunately it's not just mages. Some of them are really had bugs. Like warlock pets just forgetting all of their abilities.
---
That seems hard
---
He's German, so it is not 4 am.
---
The only thing I don't like about PvE servers is that a few of my real life friends prefer them... so I usually just end up having to play without them on a PvP server.
---
... at level 5?
---
let people choose layer upon picking server, and then dis-allow layer swapping.
---
that mimics exactly how actual classic worked anyway on a single server, and enables cloud mergers after tourist attrition
---
And I plan to repeat this trend if I'm a healer.  It's hard to find plate with int on it that is level appropriate.
---
Aren't they supposed to restat some of the gear though?
---
Where do they re-up their Aqual Quintessence again? That island just off the coast of Azshara?
---
enhance can do all of that (with improve windfury) and still do DPS to matter.
---
&gt;But even with a LC system, you do favor the more round robin approach to loot distribution?
---
Yes.  The loot council in this system just decides who is in the front of the line for certain items in the round robin.
---
If you die in certain spots in Felwood, you might as well remake your character.
---
People still twink on low population private servers even though they only get to play one battleground a month. Do not underestimate the depths our race can sink to.
---
Youbarent the brightest bulb in the tree are you?
---
The first part of your comment is incoherent babbling. Having more money than you have skill doesn't have anything to do with being paid for being skillful.
---
The second part is just asinine, I'm sure what I said applies to at the very least one multiboxer, therefore it's accurate. It wasn't an opinion. Grow a thicker skin.
---
I want this to be true but I feel like it's not.
---
&gt;I’m really not ready to believe the “its too niche” stuff, especially PR coming from a public corp. Every blue post goes through multiple sets of eyes before you see it, and multiple revs to maintain their messaging.

It wasn't a blue post, it was a tweet from Ion talking about a live QA response.
---
&gt;They are effectively making megaservers, rather than keeping it to a 3K pop cap with queues. Thats the game. Part of the game was a pop cap, and you had to wait in line to join the world, not some weird system of fading into the mist every time you group with friends from across the continent. They could host several realms on one server with the tech available today, and could make merging servers really fast and easy with some proactive work.
---
The hypothetical solution you're talking about is essentially the same thing as layering. 
---
They can't just let servers die, Blizzard isn't going to let one of their games become shit on principle. They try to maintain a standard of quality.
---
What I don't get about your point is, what cost does Blizzard cut with layering? It costs the same server resources as your idea.
---
Those two statements are not contradictory. Matchups do not matter at all in the question "which class can beat which class", as the answer is any class can beat any other class.
---
&gt;you probably also think it required a lot of skill to get that rank 14
---
More strawmans. It required more skill than what you had, since you were self admittedly 100% incapable of ever beating a frost mage, and you DEMAND that it apply to every warrior player in the world, or else it's not Blizzlike!
---
&gt; You try and multibox and see how skill less people are. 
---
Sure, when you learn how to form sentences that make sense.

This sub:
---
It’s okay to play on PvE servers!

Also this sub:

LOL RP-PVP? WHAT ARE YOU AUTISTIC LMAO
---
Could it be that people are now resorting to lying to the devs to make their class stronger?
---
Enhance is probably in the running for worst spec/class to bring to a raid PvE environment. 
---
There is no real reason to ever have one aside the mey-mays.
---
Have that person at the least slap on a healer set and heal. They will provide far more benefit than auto attacking for almost no damage  waiting for uncontrollable and unpredictable WF procs. Especially in 1.12 where WF has a 50% ap nerf and can't chain off itself.

&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | NA-PVP | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore 
---
Introduction: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other’s company, and found communist memes amusing. 
---
Raid Schedule: We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 pm EST/6:30-9:30 pm PST on Tues and Thurs. We will use loot council made up of a mix of officers and a weekly rotation of raiders with a focus on gearing tanks and healers first. 
---
Player Expectations: We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables and arrive on time. As we only will raid six hours a week, we need to be efficient and players should aim for 80%+ attendance. 
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game. 
---
Ideally looking for:
---
1 dedicated offtank
---
3 fury warriors
---
1 holy priest
---
3 resto shamans
---
2 mages
---
3 locks
---
1 resto druid
---
On Culture: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren’t tolerated. You don’t need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can’t keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit. 
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel https://discord.gg/vmC5sMb
---
Judgement is one of the coolest video game armor sets ever. Almost worth playing a Pally by itself.
---
Gimping your route to be overleveled so you would be more safe from ganking and ganking those who would be easy prey, it just echoes my impression that world pvp is for chicken.
---
Must be using Pserver numbers!
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=159/refreshing-spring-water
---
It was considered griefing from what I remember. I don't think it's fair but that's what they ruled. Nothing permanent I think but a temp.
---
As a mage, every time I leave a major city I am leaving with a full stack of mana and health pots if not at the highest level I can use, the second highest. If popping a pot saves me 5-10 minutes and costs 10-20s, it's a deal I'm going to make every time. I can farm at a much faster rate than that.
---
&gt; unless you're inexplicably pulling mobs at low enough mana
---
Honestly this makes me feel like you don't remember classic very well. Mobs run when they die, there are pats everywhere, sometimes you're in a cave with no clear escape, or you're in an instance and it's a half wipe, pvp is happening constantly (this is probably the biggest reason), sometimes you need to kill an elite, sometimes you have to pull 2+ mobs at a time... there are constantly times where you need to pot, even with CC and escapability.
---
A lot of this reads like a fanfic, the talk about OW2 and D4 really smells like it's fake.
---
Will layering or sharping always be around or do they plan to do away with it once the population starts to level out?
---
Micromanaging down to profession choice is the definition of tryhard. And it’s not a 15% increase, it’s a 5% increase to the attack speed - so not even all the damage being done. 
---
Also: It’s not like you can craft the chicken and give one to everyone in group, you’re requiring a profession choice for the life of a character based on what raid wide may be a 2-3% total dps increase. 
---
If you want to be the top guild doing the fastest/first clears, you’re a tryhard.
---
Well... This was a false alarm but super awesome to see this exists!
---
I dont necessarily rp , but I always thought the rp servers were cool as shit. 
---
Felt more like I was in a dnd game with npcs and my own rpg as I strolled through a town with all the people rping about. That is something completely unique to the rp servers
---
That's one reason I would want to avoid dkp.
---
Giving out upgrades for PvE shouldn't impact the items that are considered PvP centric. Yeah, it may get dicey around specific weapons, item pieces. But I believe that would be the case for both systems.
---
I think that is where the Wish List can help a lot if people establish beforehand the items they want above all others.
---
This reminds me of those popular opinions that keep being posted on /r/UnpopularOpinion 
---
Are there people bashing on pve servers thou? I haven’t seen any. But either way there’s nothing wrong with pve servers.
---
&gt;For Protadins, even with the mana issue resolved they still lack a taunt, which is/remains the primary reason against them. 
---
Most raid bosses or mobs are immune to taunt anyway. The bigger problem here is just the total lack of threat which dictates how much dps a raid can do.
---
I didn't see this play out in practice. There was never a point where the point total was even, and the person with the highest total got dibs. I don't recall a single piece of gear that was sharded that was an upgrade. We often knew exactly who was likely to get what gear, so everyone took upgrades when they could.
---
That makes some sense.
---
Kudos for possibly making past the moderator boss. Many have tried and failed.
---
the vanilla class designer did an interview not long ago and straight said thats the taunt they wanted to give pallys in classic but didn't have the tech for. So the designer decided to just wait instead of having to give them a normal taunt and then take it away later.
---
If you aren’t pushing server first I 100% believe you’ll be more than fine Druid tanking for a large portion of guilds.  
---
There’s always a tank shortage so you’ll find your way into 5 mans super quickly regardless.
---
I guess being competitive doesn't mean always a fair play, sometimes it's a desire to win by all means.
---
(Personally I don't understand it. When I played on a PvP server, I never attacked first, unless they had ganked me before. Well, I died a lot, but I also killed a lot and I knew that by killing I wouldn't spoil anyone's evening.)
---
If anything we WANT you carebears on our server because you probably suck at pvp and it's an easy gank lol.   
---
All trolling aside, I'm glad other players have servers that they can go to. It's deserved. That's why I really hope RP-PvP players get their own servers because they're fun as hell anyways :D
---
Patch 1.9 was released on january 3rd 2006.
---
I see you saying prove it to you a lot. Even if someone does prove it, does it change anything? Im not sure what the goal of this is?
---
&gt; and those ganks turn into counter fights and wars break out. 
---
Ohh god the world pvp fantasy bullshit that never happens.
---
When can You buy one of those?
---
Willing to make a wager on this?
---
&gt;I just told you I literally could not play the game at all if I had to wait for hours because of other mandatory things in my life. Many of us adults couldn't. Also many kids couldn't. Do you think it's selfish to think that everyone should get a chance to play? I think it's selfish of you to think that so many of us should give up the game completely just so you could have the game exactly how \*you\* like it, and not one bit different.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I hope you really do read this and think about what being selfish means...
---
It is selfish to demand a game make significant changes to its core structure because of your schedule. There are plenty of reasons people won't be able to play week one and waiting for a bit is perfectly fine. Imposing massive game altering experience because you don't have free time is what I would consider selfish.
---
You speak better English as a German than most people in America...
---
I don’t really need a cheat sheet really, I’m just in the hype really! Wanted to have things ready and set, you know?
---
But hey thanks man.
---
the patch notes are wrong:
---
Ill just stick to the better spec
---
but meme it up if you want 
---
you do you
---
well he is my irl friend ;p i wont replace him that fast
---
Yes but did your server open AQ at the same time as the forerunners.  
---
There was a cascade with some servers opening it quite quickly while others lagged behind, some very far behind.  
---
Many would be very surprised to see just how far back thier AQ opening actually was in the roster of servers. 
---
Especially on later servers that formed, those never even seen the first art at all as they were created in vanilla post changes.  Guaranteed to only see the updated models pre AQ.  Though in a confined aspect, the only version of wow gear they know.
---
This will be an interesting subject to watch.  But I suspect Blizzard will absolutely use the updated models early as they were the intended models but simply weren't ready at the time.
---
Thanks bro, totally helpful.
---
One week is character creation
---
Corrected, Thanks :)
---
Is that confirmed to be a classic mechanic?
---
every hybrid got improved mana regen in tbc so yeah?  they weren't viable from a pure dps standpoint still, even with other, non mana related changes, but they were given unique utility that made them desirable regardless
---
Huh ? I’d hardly call it gimping. If you’re solo questing being slightly overlevelled is way better xp wise than than being under levelled for zone
---
Yes, PvP.
---
No. I have no idea what logical backflips you had to go through to come up with this notion. Abilities that don't put you in combat have no effect on the swing timer. Nor does being out of combat in the first place.
---
I would quit the guild that gives it to a hunter...
---
No, they want people playing the new retail patch. Not to mention the chances of getting in was already insanely low.
---
It actually just gets boring. When you are playing on your own or with a few people it takes so long to hit 40 and it will get wiped. I played a ton (3 days played on a beta is pretty good) up to 30, and at 30. When they increased the level cap I got my fix and was able to report a ton of bugs. Don't have interest in spending another day played to get to 40 and then get it wiped.
---
you just create a different problem  
---
suddenly the best way to level is to be in a 'high level only' layer
---
Agreed, the only times I've ever been camped like this (been playing since vanilla) are when there's a player who are 5-10 levels higher than me and still can get honor. And even then.... very few times this happens because I just take a 5 min break and everything is good lol.
---
That talent build is for single target not aoe btw
---
Also there's a free wand you can get around level 11 from a darkshore quest
---
Fair point, but perhaps he could do something else than tank, unless he is 100% about tanking?
---
Nice, which room were you? I was Rankil the gnome rogue. Going to give a shot at warrior this time around.
---
The goal of this is, is that everyone is so sure melee leeway was a thing in vanilla but they have absolutely nothing to back up that claim. So I want to know if anyone can actually prove it was a vanilla mechanic or whether it’s something that’s come from the Leigon client.  Blizzard have been quiet about it so far so I reckon there’s more to it than what the community knows.  I’m also trying to get more publicity to this issue because as it stands right now, Melee have a huge buff and hunter has a big problem on its hands.
---
Hey, would love to know your guilds name! Sounds like it aligns with my goals for wow
---
They plan to get rid of it when population allows. The only hard promise we have is by phase 2, but no ETA has been given for how long that will even be.
---
End of the day its still a paywall.  
---
Just the whole situation is pretty short sighted.  Classic players who have no interest in any other blizzard product must sub months in advanced for the mere chance of playing a limited beta? 
---
I'm shocked the numbers aren't lower.
---
thats just bullshit that gets repeated everytime without any proof
---
More like Hoe-ch-lund (the ch is a chrhchr sound like you are spitting) but it starts with hoe and ands with lund.
---
PvE server is the same as layering abuse : you choose to use a game mechanic to dodge interactions within the world. 
---
You should not be able to quest in your little bubble. The fight between Horde and Alliance, the World of Warcraft, is playing around you and you should participate, good and bad.
---
Any made for druids?
---
Unfortunately I do not remember my time and I did not screenshot it. 
---
Is there a way to dig an hours and minutes number out of achievement completion data? That'd be the only way I'd be able to get the number, since I don't trust my memory from that long ago with any reasonable level of precision.
---
It doesn't matter. If you "fix" one spec if changes the game meta. It's a new game, not Classic.
---
No one has done much threat value testing in the beta, but Battle Shout does generate threat for every member that receives or refreshes the buff.
---
incorrect
---
Need some spicy memes.
---
lmao....
---
Lol I guess you just rage quit before it happens. I’ve been part of countless faction wars in many different zones. And if playing a game is in any way suffering to you, I think you have bigger problems
---
War mode is such a great idea, but it had one fatal flaw in that over time the "losing" faction loses motivation to participate, which leads to less support and more frustration for those that continues. Towards the end of my time at BFA going into war mode as alliance was a giant "grief me" sign as there would be flooding with horde and no alliance. At least everyone got to feel the pain I went through in vanilla rolling Alliance on Demon Soul (one of the first servers with a population massively tilted towards horde).
---
8.2 came out a week ago? I was hitting lvl 40 12 days ago, and wasn't able to get a random dungeon group going... there where mybe 40 players online in a 36-40 lvl range, sadly i did not have a screenshot. It was around 10pm in germany ... so maybe 1pm server time.
---
Found a neckbeard with a pointless vendetta against streamers. And it seems you still don't even understand what that argument was about. Nobody's arguing for blacklisting people for just corpsecamping, it's streamsniping that's the problematic part.
---
Maybe the dude who is getting his posts moderated for insulting large groups of people is the one who should calm down. Why are you defending him?
---
Ret Paladin groups are nigh invulnerable. UNDERRATED TOP TIER.
---
When people get low, you have a healer and three offhealers.
---
Three consecrations.
---
Three bubbles.
---
Three auras.
---
But yeah their single-target sustained is poo-poo
---
BUT THE FEELING OF THE CRUSADE
---
A second monitor is a great investment though, can't recommend it enough. All comes down to what you like and are willing to invest in though.
---
that's just a link to a picture. where is the video upload?
---
I mean, I know people gank in redridge, but it takes horde a long-ass time to get there.  I don't really see people travelling that distance between BGs.
---
People who do take the time to go there are scummy, for sure.
---
I had planned on going human mage but that background of the gnome is so so very tempting... cool guide, thanks for throwing it together!!
---
Can't dodge block or parry while casting .  will lose spike and holy shield threat.  Works great on inc though if you're missing a little health after the tag for roundup.
---
Well what faction are you?  Take out the other factions zones, that is useless information.  The wand progression is a great tool.  Any other class may want to put gold milestones to make sure they get their mount on time, but that stuff you don’t need.
---
Why would I want to know that as a tank? If it isn't attacking me, I can see that. Before I want to find out who it's attacking, I've already gone and aggroed it back.
---
What kind of retards sits looking at target of target while his group dies?
---
The 2 10 hour players can only playing during the same window. The 40 hour player mostly has way more free time and plays the 40 hours in random moments. If you dont understand this then idk how else to explain it since my english is not native and pretty bad
---
Not sure what in his post you disagree with. I've heard from a few people in hard core private guilds that they are doing exactly what he described. Everything except leveling and running the raid is being done by friends/fanboys/recruits to the guild.
---
Dis be not hard bruddah.
---
It depends what content you are clearing and what is available.
---
Not for us nerds that have been roleplaying since tabletop games
---
World pvp is a massive and essential part of getting to rank 14, especially on a fresh server. There is absolutely a legitimate reason for lvl 60s to gank high level questing zones
---
So you CAN have both up, Just only benefit 1 type of dps at a time.
---
No, coming from someone who pvp a lot as spriest.
---
It's not okay. If you play classic wow on a pve server you are a pussy.  Don't be a softie casual, join a PvP server to get gud.
---
Yeah i’m not sure how i felt about being able to manually flag at your choosing but at least with wm on you get some nice pvp spells
---
yeah many of them shine in PvP 
---
Elemental can be a blast in pvp, same with shadow
---
That's a lot to some people. And why pay to progress though whats going to be wiped in a couple months?
---
Not if you have a Cat, I have a macro which I use that puts me in Shadowmeld and my cats prowl at the same time so I am basically a stealth hunter it is incredibly op in world pvp lmao.
---
Maybe you're right. But assuming this: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8avbb/investigations_vanilla_tier2_graphics_changed_in/
---
I strill think that you are wrong
---
"How can it be any fun without sabotaging other players."
---
Why do you even care? Serious question
---
World PvP is more fair on PVE servers since the you have to opt in. Change my mind.
---
On a PVE server, you can flag PVP in STV and maybe get someone around your level to pick a fight with you. 60s won't be roaming looking for ganks since there arent as many flagged.
---
Am I wrong? Think about it. You first have to understand that world PvP isn't competitive. It's only ganking, griefing, or trolling. So you have to look at the motivations of ganking, griefing, trolling. There is no "competitive spirit" or the excitement of competition that you might find in Arena or a Battleground (both of which I love). So what's left? I suppose I'll concede to role players because they are kind of acting in a way that's not a direct reflection of themselves. However if it's just a normal player ganking, griefing, or trolling it's because they take enjoyment out of knowing that they are disrupting someone's experience and probably making them pretty upset.
---
I dont understand. We are talking about dkp. Qualifiers and rolling are not used. If you have the dkp, you get it. If you havent seen these issues, you probably haven't played on a vanilla private server and are instead basing this off experiences in retail . Loot isnt as scarce in retail and you dont have 10+ melee or casters in a raid all wanting the same bis item.
---
Isn't it difficult to play 2 characters at a time? It's like microing, right?
---
Dont worry, they wont attack unless the content is interesting or funny.
---
Yes it would, especially since things are automated now.
---
Don't be such a pussy.
---
There, am I doing this right?
---
The first BC patch had a line saying something along the lines of fixed an issue where battle shout was causing too much threat, so it should be a classic mechanic. Think it was in the notes for 2.0.1
---
I'm definitely waiting until August. Playing a character that I know will be deleted is not appealing. I can use these 2 months to get some IRL things done, and finish out summer.
---
This was bothering me so I busted out my WoW Diary and it says almost exactly what /u/sptim says under the info about BWL development:
---
* Tier 2 pieces dropped from MC pre-1.4. These were the old models. Helm and Legs from MC/Ony continued to be old models after 1.4. 
---
* The new models were released with BWL in patch 1.6. Existing pieces required a further content patch to change. 
---
* Patch 1.9 retroactively changes all remaining old models and made it into the patch notes.
---
Earlier in the chapter on patch cycles it notes that Patch Notes did not become very detailed until patch 1.8 and that many small QoL changes were left out in earlier patch notes.
---
/r/HydroHomies
---
There is no doubt that multiboxing is a pay to win situation. The advantage you gain is incredibly high compared to the effort required to broadcast commands to multiple clients. 
---
&gt; It required a lot more skill to multibox a dungeon than regular party from what I am reading.
---
This depends on the person. A multiboxer may lack the social skills to maintain relationships and keep friends. It may be very hard for them to lead a group with real humans, or target call for players they don't directly control. Boxing removes a huge part of the social element of the game. Its for that reason I think it should have no place in most MMOs.
---
Yes you can have both up but, thats not really what people care about. What they care about is can the WF totem benefit the Melee dps, while mana tide does the ranged dps at the same time. Unfortunately the answer is no.
---
But didn‘t transfer some hardcore guilds Werks in bfa from na to eu and back to get more items?
---
Tbh, I dont really like the addon thing, and the way the stuff was supposed to work before you guys (I think you're part of them?)changed it to non-mandatory, as that was kinda dumb fourth reich like. I dont particularly like streamer, but that seems a bit hardcore to me, but all the power to you and I hope you succeed.
---
yeah that and Ret, I really can see a big reason to bring along
---
You can still sapper, but yeah it's not that big as a healer. If you don't pvp I would honestly skip engi and do some guild crafting like enchanting, blacksmithing etc.
---
Well then how was 1 person able to do all of them like stated in comments above mine?
---
Ty😉
---
If retail is anything to go by, PvP servers should be fine. Usually more populated.
---
I get it - you don't have to keep trying to explain the benefits of it - but if you are REQUIRING every single raider to run engineering - you're still a tryhard. There's nothing wrong with being a tryhard, you probably kill shit way before I will. Congrats. I killed all but 7 bosses in this game 15 years ago without ever even sniffing engineering. 
---
It's not necessary for progression. Does it help? Yes. Should it be required? Only if you're in a tryhard guild. 
---
&gt;like imagine inviting someone to your raid, they just afk. you think that doesn't matter because they only make up 4% of the raid's dps? don't micromanage them, they main afk.
---
Great strawman - you really should go into business making and selling them.
---
I think it's a joke about how all the people who played Vanilla are old now.
---
[Dire Maul will be available within 2 months](https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=571).
---
[Average time to 60 in Vanilla/Pservers was likely no less than 240 hours](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/news/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-level-60-in-wow-classic-an-objective-look/).
---
[Average WoW player spends ~23 hours per week in-game](http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001365.php).
---
That's almost 11 weeks level 60, meaning Dire Maul will be out before a majority of players hit 60.
---
From looking through some old comments on thottbot they were shown in the trailer for 1.6 but not added until 1.9. People were quite surprised they weren't added in 1.6. Even the npc's in silithus had them on while players still wore the old sets.
---
From what I've listened to, many of the big successful podcasts are for the serious players who analyze so many minute aspects of the game. I like to think a podcast made for people who are "bad" at WoW would stand out more, and not like some LEtsPlayYoutuber hopping on the bandwagon. 
---
Slightly related, my wife makes fun of me for watch MadSeasonShow, Frostadamus, TipsOut because they talk about points too specific for a newcomer to grasp right away. Thanks for the question.
---
If it’s not- It definitely should due to the original notes for BC here: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1
---
“Fixed an issue where Warrior "Battle Shout" was causing too much threat.0
---
PvP server it is then, i can't wait to add to that blanket of skeletons on the streets of Stormwind.
---
Look how far we’ve come..I remember my old PC back in vanilla would cut frames when going into Org or SW pshh
---
oh man, I can do a good Hank Hill voice and I loved reading this out loud to my annoyed coworkers.
---
Not at all, you just look like a dumb hypocrite now
---
Rag will die the first week. Around 6 days after launch.
---
Please make sure you people understand this. What follows is usually disappointment. People say it’s too easy and they feel they are super far behind.
---
The cooldown was removed in a later expansion.
---
Requesting for a folder of these to be stickied or added to the faq section of the sub as ref walls. Amazing resource keep up the good work
---
Have you played vanilla? I think Rag has enough unavoidable damage for healers in blue items to run oom even before sons show up.
---
Bubble/shield is a pally taunt. You need to know who to use it on
---
I hate pvp and play the game solely for the PVE content,  but I would never even consider rolling on a PVE server.  It is the coward's way out.
---
Looks like a mage buff. 
---
Nerf it.
---
I going to Leeroy Jenkins the shnit out of Armageddon comboy there!
---
Don't pretend that its all that tough. 90% of the work is the set up, anyway. Once you've got it going its no big deal.
---
That’s a tiny issue.
---
I'm sure there are some old mage AoE farming videos kicking around that you can watch to confirm.
---
Another thread by butt hurt carebears upset that they're low status compared to people who put the War, in Warcraft.
---
yes but in what party would a shaman be in with melee and casters between the 4 other people? It's one of the other
---
This is a good point and I agree with you. But when you are corpse camped the whole time you're logged in, maybe I have bad luck, but that is just not fun at all. For that reason alone I choose to play on PvE servers.
---
Completely agree with a social part of you argument. Several people shared their experiences and social aspect was a part for some of them.
---
Pay to win implies paying money for an advantage to win the actual game. Since wow doesn't have win mechanics I am not sure I agree.  May you elaborate on the getting advantage by multiboxing part. I am curious to understand you train of thought.
---
Mainstream behaviour on the internet is way more obnoxious than it used to be. The pervasiveness of internet culture had added opportunities for mayhem that barely existed prior to 2010: swatting, doxxing, deplatforming, law enforcement attention for mean tweets, etc.
---
In 2004 you might have run into some forum goons calling you mean names and showing you disgusting photos. Now you might run into people genuinely trying to ruin your life.
---
Did you use qiyou?
---
The biggest issues with threat generation as a warrior at low levels are enemies resisting taunt and very low rage generation. Even in WC it is difficult to maintain threat and I didn't start feeling like I could actually tank properly until around the level for SFK (mid-late 20s).  Lower than that and it's kind of random, lots of enemies will resist taunt and you have to wait 10s to try again.
---
You're always a LOT better off if the tank is a higher level since misses are more uncommon. At level 17 in Deadmines I would imagine you were missing a lot of attacks, which means you weren't building rage or threat, and if something then resists taunt you're SOL for several seconds. It's an unfortunate snowball effect. Your healer will then have higher threat than you will (it's kind of tough to miss a heal), along with any higher-level DPS.
---
Can't wait for retail folks to realize that ilevel does not exist in classic.
---
Imagine all the "raid leaders" who spam chat today "minimum gear score XXX" when they realize this does not exist.
---
Just to add, the patch went live, but the gates weren't opened.  You still had almost a month for realm firsts, I seem to remember our realm was somewhere in a month and a half.  So we would have already done several BWL clears.
---
Or you could bring a supporting role.
---
The group with absolutely no life and some mental illness will get Rag down.
---
Amusing thinking of all the effort people will go through just to get the world #10 billionth rag kill. (world first happened back in the first year of WoW's launch)
---
Hmm.... let's see, movement is the same, camera is the same, the basics of spell casting are the same, the pseudo turn based combat is the same.
---
Yes if you can play retail you can play classic, the details might be different but you won't have any problems with the basics.
---
Well maybe you personally will but the average person won't.
---
Sounds like you’re choosing to ignore what I said and make your opinions facts. Bet you have healthy relationships /s
---
That's on Private Servers though, it will be different on Classic as the feral forms will be nerfed (they were doing too much damage on ps's)
---
Well which one is for classic, ahhhh!! now I just feel like you're messing with me.
---
If it was removed in later "expansion" then that cooldown will still be present in classic? And if that's the case, will these hardcore guilds require 8 different people doing so to kill Rag on week 1?
---
DM does not have "better loot than MC"... There are a few BiS items for certain classes, but in general MC loot is better than DM loot. What DM has though is better loot than the dungeons available before MC, and considering you are not fully MC geared that fast DM will have quite a few upgrades for you.
---
Blizzard already said that layering is supposed to last a few weeks. No guarantee obviously, but I highly doubt 3+ months of P1 with layering.
---
is AOE grinding really the fastest?
---
That would kinda be amazing lol
---
sappers.
---
I was 23 . Now 38. Not only was I 1 year off but I forgot I already turned 38. Lmao.
---
anyone who raids and doesnt have engineering is bad at the game.  fact
---
Bow down plebs? A real Vanilla vet would say *bow down ya shits*. I mean us vets have seen some shit; we're long passed the point of holding back and being all careful with wording. Also you gotta talk through your balls to immediately let the pack know how small they are and that they shouldn't even think to f\*ck with you. So use big heavy hitting words that makes everyone reflex backwards and sweating fear. Also if you want to survive in WoW as a vet, I hope you're upping your testosterone and inject some shit, because if not, you can't compete, man. Tough times are incoming come August.
---
I am not disputing the research, it might be that My server was behind the curve, but I remember wearing T2 for a long ass time before we got aq opened :)
---
There are talents and other effects that change the mana cost of spells, base mana cost wording is used because of that. It will always return the same amount (10% of the base = original cost of the spell), regardless of how much you change the mana cost of a spell. 
---
An easy example is clearcasting, it makes your spell cost 100% less mana, so 0, if that spell crits you still gain the 10% of it's base cost.
---
While that may be, the conversation is about ganking lowbies for no benefit
---
&gt;the PvE vocal minority posting on this reddit think that world PvP should be punishable by death via the Geneva Convention, and that anyone who does enjoy it is &lt;insert ad hominem here&gt;
---
Ironic that you should call out ad hominem *inside of* a hyperbolic straw man.
---
Again where the hell are you quoting this “minimum?”
---
Joana did it in 116 hours. That’s the record.
---
Your claiming it will be done in UNDER 4 days played.
---
send the file brother.

---
I mean, restat some of the set pieces.
---
You forgot Zin rokh, very common to see hunters using it
---
I fought wave after wave of orbs till the mowed me down with arcane missiles
---
If you play a lock..netlauncher will be your best friend ;)
---
I didn't say they weren't remakes, I just said they were really good tiers.   Pally tier from ToS is about the only armor I think that rivals Judgement.  The LFR color is a phenomenal purple take on it(I had all recolors of all pally tier sets in legion except the mythic sets and the ranked pvp)
---
Rouge plz
---
do you know there is neutral AH on pvp servers too?
---
"This isn't a massive issue, but something to keep in mind when taking skinning."
---
Truly unprecedented levels of fear mongering.
---
Instead of skinning a mob after looting it you can clear a camp first and then skin all mobs at once regenerating your health in the meantime.
---
At least it’s true to its name.
---
What exactly is a reference wallpaper? I’m interested.
---
What exactly is so fun on homophobic, racist and idiotic chat that scrolls faster than you can read?
---
Feral&gt;Spellpower ret &gt; oomer &gt; ele &gt; enhancer though enhance I guess you can argue brings a lot of dps with totems, but a shaman should've done that instead.
---
This honestly doesn’t matter. 
---
If you’re in a pug what are the odds of coordinating who is defending and who isn’t. 
---
If you’re in a pre-made, odds are you’re cycling who gets R14. Someone’s gotta be stable/farm bitch and miss out on the honor.
---
It’s time.... for some retribution!!! 
---
I always loved how the AQ40 T2.5ones gave cool specs a chance. Even the hunter one has wonky
---
Spell damage stats for trying the “arcane shot” build. Practical? Not really, but definitely fun as hell to collect and for pallies who wouldn’t want this? They all Ret deep down.
---
As a rogue I + this x100
---
Well, I'll be... I've been stressing over quest hand-in order for 15 years. Thanks :)
---
I despised horde for nearly 13 years, but after rolling a ton of horde alts in the passed few months, I actually despise pvp elitists and min/max'ers a shit load more. Even more than streamers.
---
"For the PVE!"
---
There will likely be Southshore/Tarren Mill shenanigans in phase 2 on PvE servers. There was on my PvE server in Vanilla before BGs came out.
---
I’ve always been horde, but I’ve been thinking about classic factions with an open mind, rolling whichever side my friends want. I know quite a few paladin players, so I’ll be switching allegiances this time around!
---
Yeah this is exactly what they're getting at. Dropping mana tide meant that meele no longer gets windfury.

You're either arguing semantics and couldn't understand the word "some" or you actually think you should send your pet in on every single boss in the game.

Paladin police force unite

I'm assuming you mean a resto shaman.
---
20 mins nap? My usually last 2 to 3 hours...
---
I’m pretty sure you can still get them on Etsy. That’s where I bought mine!
---
Its very very very viable. The end
---
Im gonna be doing a build that alows me to heal any raid, and tank any dungeon :P
---
You only get spirit regen when you’re walking or drinking, not when you’re fighting. If you’re using mage armor and trying to aoe level, you’re wrong.
---
What are you even talking about? It's removed or a bug in classic beta.

In vanilla, the class meta changed pretty dramatically with every class rework. 1.1 is much different meta than 1.12.
---
It is very fuckin cool that German has gendered classes. Would love to see blizz add them for English if they can come up with the right words!
---
If you aren't willing to tank you shouldn't be rolling a warrior. The entire rage mechanic is built around dealing and receiving damage.
---
Played on and off from vanilla to the end of Wotlk. Made a ton of friends in vanilla and loved my guild. I'm still good friends with many of my original guildmates 15 years later. I slowly watched as the casualization started creeping into wow from TBC onwards: Daily grinds, Arena 10 game minumums, Mana/Health pots being nerfed to 1 per fight (coupled with the consolidation of potions/elixirs.)  Even so, I still felt TBC was the "golden age" of World of Warcraft.
---
Then on into Wotlk with braindead dungeons/raids for the entry tier, pvp being a shitfest, and gold/economy in an absolutely abysmal state. (everyone had too much gold from all the dailies and quests available. With professions having little impact and dual spec there was very few reasons for players to spend their gold on anything other than mounts)
---
My once awesome guild slowly burnt out and fell apart as the core players got tired of the game and started leaving in droves. This left the less experienced/disciplined players to take over and turn the guild into a deathmatch of old vs new members. I got tired of all the drama, coupled with none of my friends playing I decided to quit aswell... Until ICC came out. I re-subbed only to find all of my raiding gear being worse than the heroic ICC 5man dungeons. Because of the gearscore mod I had a terrible time trying to find groups or even a new guild to run with, LFD was the only way I could get into 5mans as everyone expected you to at least have XXXXX gearscore/achievements for organized groups/raids. I saw the game turn from a fun, social game into the narcissistic nobody-gives-a-fuck because cross-realm score/metric driven catastrophe that is current retail wow.
---
My best friend convinced me somehow to try pandas and that only lasted for a month. I hated everything about that expansion, blizzards pandering to Chinese players left a really bitter taste in my mouth.  I felt that blizz no longer cared about their western audience that built them and now only cared for that sweet China $. It's well known that the Asian market likes ~~boring~~(grindy) and pretty games with loads of micro-transactions in order make your character even more pretty with the occasional Pay to Win added on.
---
All that said I really hope to enjoy World of Warcraft again with my friends through classic. My ultimate hope is to be able to Play TBC again, but I'll settle for classic as it was a hell of an awesome game, and still is in my opinion by today's standards.
---
Mind control galore!
---
Lmao
---
But what if large fear?
---
My bad 2 points in improved weapon totems increases melee attack power by 30%. Still, that's a pretty big increase only enchance can bring. Annihilator works better for enchance as a debuff weapon but it is a use for them.
---
HQ shading!
---
yeah i know, can't wait to see warriors dpsing in rogue gear
---
My bet is, that Ragnaros will be downed somewhere between sunday evening and monday morning on the first week.
---
Pro tip, if you are going to AOE level, absolutely do NOT train frostbite. It will fk up your blizzard aoe groupings and result in death about 99% of the time. If you’re not aoe leveling, frostbite is an ok pickup, but doesn’t proc as much as you’d hope. I put it in my least priority
---
You're already OP having 3 extra party members on at the same time.
---
I’m not the above guy, but I’m fairly certain people will do it much faster than Joana did. Maybe not 90 hours, but coordinated 5 man dungeon teams will hit 60 faster than Joana ever did. Not as many people back in the vanilla days went all out on leveling as they do now, and I don’t really remember it being commonly understood that dungeons were the best way to level (when done optimally) until TBC days
---
Is this like the time I was promised in game Panda Express?
---
That's not the biggest issue. Global warming is.
---
Only concern with greens if you're close to dinging. If you turn in an orange and level, the green can turn gray, and it'll drop 20%, but other than that - green to red, there's no difference.
---
There's a **perceived** difference, since orange / red are 5-10 levels higher than you are, so they have a bigger impact than a green quest 2-3 levels below you. But if that red level 48 quest is worth 4,000xp at level 40, it'll still be worth 4,000xp at level 50. (but 4,000 means more at 40 than 50, hence the perceived 'worth more')
---
That, and the debuff limit. Spriests specifically could do some pretty nasty numbers if allowed to use their full kit.
---
More to your point, there is a video series on Youtube where someone tests the DPS of a bunch of specs with buffs and consumables. On the hybrid class videos, most of them start out fairly well, but plummet when they run out of mana. 
---
Note: They are far from perfect tests (some more so than others), but are still super interesting.
---
Oh look, [retail](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/9oka9p/wow_active_players_leaked/) hate in r/classic, how cool and original.
---
Not sure if you've ever played classic before but....  plenty of folks use the chat. It's literally the only way to find dungeon groups.
---
I don't like PvE servers.  When I first started playing Vanilla, I was on a PvE server, but switched after hitting level 25 because, based on the lore, it seemed odd that Alliance and Horde wouldn't attack each other on sight.  I don't think there's anything wrong with other people wanting to play on PvE servers, but I'd much rather play on a PvP server.  PvP simply has better immersion imo.
---
Yo where do I get that
---
Yeah, kinda the same concern still. Doesn’t sound like enough content, and it’s a super niche group you’re targeting.
---
If I skip spell training while leveling (for example, skipping Curse of Recklessness Rank 1 or Create Healthstone (Minor)) can I train the higher ranks at the appropriate level without the previous ranks, or will I have to train each rank in order?
---
We talking PvE or PvP? I played with a ele shaman in raids that kept up with the mages and locks. He was a major mana pot and demonic rune fiend though. And I know ele shamans do fine in PvP as they are bursty AF
---
Thats true. Yea idk what to add more, you re right
---
You're not a very nice person and your reading comprehension is really poor.  You can go back and read this conversation and realize that you are just being rude and not understanding what another person is saying and being even more rude as a result.  At least I'll be able to block you on reddit so I won't have to see what other dumb things you have to say.
---
If you'd like, I'd be happy to remove the rotations from the image for you. :)
---
I think they're upset that people don't think/believe/want the same thing as them. 
---
It's like a 3 year old saying they want chocolate ice cream, and mommy wanting strawberry.  Chocolate is *surely* the best, so it's offensive that anyone thinks differently.
---
These are special people....
---
The most? Tbh, you cant really determine that for world pvp, as you wont know how, or with what, people will response to your gank group. But seeing as how pve is included.. healer with arms warrior (moral strike) and two dps. Take your pick of any dps or heals.
---
So the #nochanges people are more like #somechanges people instead and just incorrectly named their "movement"?
---
Cheatsheet for noobs who don’t know their classes
---
PvE existed in Vanilla. Were you even there?
---
Because the community went into a frenzy when they found out that spell batching wasn't in the game. They didn't know what it was but they were still outraged. We've made our bed so to speak.
---
The blacklist is the privilege. You're obviously putting a streamer being griefied into another box than a normal player being griefed. You say it yourself. I really don't care either way, but letting server celebrities dictate a blacklist is not going to end well for anyone but the streamers. Surely, you see the irony here. 
---
I've put way more time into this than I care for. Have a nice day.
---
Shadow Priest pretty please!
---
Melee leeway isn't catching up, it's a lag tolerance - spells also have it iirc. As for batching, that's what creates the Vanilla style gameplay where Rogues would Gouge each other at the same time, Mages could sheep each other, where you could Vanish spells before they hit you, etc.
---
If I was playing shaman, I would likely go full resto to Mike dungeon spam as easy as possible, then respec to 30/0/21 if I expected to solo pvp,  21/0/30 of I expected to group pvp as a healer, and 11/9/31 if I had a large group and I was main healer. 
---
Absolute ideal would be to get hand of Edward the odd and play 21/0/30.
---
I disagree I remember times when I was like 13-15 and played warcraft 3 and counter-strike 1.5 / 1.6 all day long...  
---
I don't know if it was just the polish community but what We've got today doesn't even come close... Back then you could barely play a game without getting flamed HARD esp if you made any mistake or wasn't good enough... Griefing was way more common too... This outrage culture was not a thing back then since games weren't mainstream, you simply had to grow a thick skin...
---
&gt; I loved that mouse, if you're like my I upgraded to G600 and couldn't go back for anything now
---
G600 is the best mouse ever hands down
---
Now kill him when you’re level 9 for elite level.
---
WoW PvP is pretty carebear honestly.
---
Druidin
---
wtf, why do Germans get the ultimate hybrid class???
---
Hmm, interesting. So do you think those hardcore 1st week raiders will be farming rep like this in MC prior to clearing it?
---
Paladin, hunter, paladin, hunter
---
Pve: Tank, heal, dps
---
+
---
Pvp: 4 bubbles, 2 healers, 2 ranged with pet
---
(Either this or 4 feral Druids)
---
I honestly thought that was where this was posted.
---
Reported
---
Is the following correct? At these skills you can get anything at all the profession can gather?
---
* Herbalism 300 allows picking all herbs, but may require Blood Scythe
---
* Mining 305 allows mining all veins
---
* Skinning 315 allows mining all beasts
---
It won't. The Classic API will be based on retail. It would be easier to port modern add-ons to Classic than it would be to use Vanilla add-ons.
---
They both help Ret Paladins! CHECKMATE
---
Its patch specific on if you have a cooldown or not. Classic wow is on patch 1.12, but its very possible they force the original cooldown. On private servers you could have 1 person douse all the runes, which might be possible if they go with the post-patch cooldown.
---
Blizzard sold them in the store a while ago.  They were on clearance a few years ago, bought a few as gifts for old WoW friends of mine.
---
World Of Warcraft. Its in the title. I don\`t sea carebear in there. Not at all.   
---
I can\`t even comprehend as to why one thinks its ok to play on PVE server. MMORPG. The entire point of online games is to bash eachothers skulls in. The thrill, the excitement. Oh my.
---
Right!! I was like this idiot! He didn’t even kill the last guy 😂 and then the wooosshhhh
---
Do we think less than a million subscribers is plausible?
---
No thanks I'll just be a neet and play classic wow instead
---
But people still inspect your gear and enchants for pugs so if you’re a trash casual you’ll still not get a spot.
---
So 30 people help 1, and they need 5 to start. So 150 people to get those first 5 up. And then the other 35
---
Finding 40 no lifers I get. Finding 300? I mean sure I guess it “could” be done
---
Bug fixes of obviously unintentional end exploitable shit isn't "Changes." It's just, like, obviously the right thing to do.
---
What info is on it?
---
Don't confuse leeway with the added range, leeway did exist for both spells and melee, what it means is that if you moved slightly out of range of an already started attack, it still could go through. What you see on beta is just an added range on top of leeway. It's a bug and should be removed.
---
Batching should definately be at least adjusted, especially since it lags the game in places that aren't just combat. I'm not 100% certain on this but the insane loot lag seems to be caused by the batching, and it makes feel a lot worse than on private servers. I see no reason to have something that is objectively bad in the game, like loot lag.
---
I find these comments condescending as hell.  The guys racing to 60 to enter the end-game as quickly as possible aren't shitting on people that just want to PvP, or shitting on people that want to roll a bunch of alts, or shitting on people that want to meander at whatever pace they prefer on their way to 60.  but for some reason, there's this constant refrain on here shitting on everyone that wants to race to 60.  Where's all this insecurity coming from?  Why can't they play the way they want without ridicule?
---
These people understand what Classic is, and they understand what they're signing up for by racing to 60.  They fully understand that this playstyle will result in them blitzing through the content and "completing" the game at a greatly accelerated rate.  This idea that they're all gonna be whining for additional content is purely a contrived fiction in order to try to ridicule them.  I have no idea where this incessant and pathetic need some of you have to do this comes from.
---
Countdown to classic is the best imo, Deftalk, Blizzard Watch sometimes, classic WoW podcast
---
Or somehow believing that private servers are accurate
---
k, whatever you say princess.
---
Asmongold seems to think his guild will manage to down Rag within the first 2 weeks of launch.  While I think it's POSSIBLE, I don't think it's likely.  I definitely think there will be a guild to down Rag within the first 3 weeks, though.
---
retail + private servers all together close to 1000 days
---
Talent paths, gear progression, aoe grind spot progression, stuff like that.
---
A book for you to read, if you can find it-- "Steppe" by Piers Anthony.  Written a long time ago,  but THAT is the type of mmo you're describing.
---
Precisely. No raid group had 8 shaman lol. Maybe like 5. So there aren't enough shaman for each group to have one. I forget when they made it so you couldnt swap people's groups in combat. I feel like we did this with shadow priests in BC too. But I forget.
---
TBC made many hybrid specs "viable" in that their dps wasn't *terrible* but you would still never take a hybrid over a pure class if dps was all you cared about. In TBC all the pure classes were actually really fucking strong. Still things like ret pally, enhance shaman, and feral druid were VERY common. I remember boomkin and shadow priests being pretty damn weak though, but maybe that was just my guild. 
---
WOTLK was the expansion where the idea of a "hybrid tax"(before this blizz considered it fair that hybrids did a lot less dmg simply because they could do more than one role) really went away.
---
This is a stupid question, but assuming 21/0/30 is shock spec, how does it handle in solo PvE (and solo WPvP too, of course). I plan to level from ~36-60 as 30/0/21, so that's a factor in my comparison
---
me warrior me spam hamstring me good player
---
Melee: "We want to gain an advantage!"  
---
Ranged: "We don't want to LOSE an advantage!"  
---
You're both assholes from what I can see.
---
Crosspost this on /r/hydrohomies
---
not really.. only in these times devs care about toxicity in games... back then you had to grow a thick skin... now they censor words, disable enemy chat (hots/hearthstone come to my mind) and make automated reporting systems (every game in last 10 years)
---
 Have you thought about just making some budget shit yourself? Cardboard, paper mache and paint? 
---
I’m not an expert but I had a friend who made an awesome professor chaos (South Park) costume for comic con and it was pretty damn good,
---
Well it would be strong, but the total lack of range and any CC would put you in a world of hurt if even numbers show up.
---
Much appreciated!
---
I hate leading groups.  But I always lead them as a tank.  You just have to, to get anything done in reasonable period of time.
---
I agree. I think for the most part they're wildly unhappy unsuccessful people. So they want to make others unhappy, because it hurts to much to see others *not* miserable.
---
There are people on private servers who literally camp certain spots ALL DAY. 
---
This one rogue would hang out in Redridge, let escort group come all the way down from that northern cave, and then kill the escort and players about 5 seconds from the completion spot. All. Day. Long.
---
I'd probably prefer PvE servers for 90% of the game.  However, there are some epic moments to be had fighting over world bosses that will just not be the same on PvE servers. I wish PvE servers had world boss zones become PvP areas while the bosses were up.
---
If they added mana cost talents that required you to invest at least 31 talent points in the meme DPS tree it would basically make balance and elemental PvE DPS somewhat viable without messing up the PvP too much since they'd have to give up nature's swiftness.
---
It'd be a bad idea to make the base mana costs cheaper for balance and elemental spells because it would inadvertently buff resto druid/shaman which is already in a good place.
---
Ha, I did 90% of my tanking with a 2h in Vanilla.
---
This post looks familiar...
---
All the class changes for 2 years being in on release.
---
It's a massive change from actual vanilla
---
Grats, you gained 26 DPS by bringing imp. windfury and lost 500 DPS by bringing an enhancement shaman.
---
Aren’t edgemasters handguards like CRAAAZY expensive? Like thousands of gold? 
---
I would never in a million years be able to afford that lol
---
It was an example, you don't need that number. Even one extra hunter following each person doubles your levelling speed. If youre the warrior? That extra dps probably triples your levelling speed.
---
Completely agree! The chill presentation is great for commuting
---
if these ever come together for all classes sidebar tf outta this please
---
Shadow, Elemental and Balance would probably be pretty good if they got like a relic or something that boosted the mana regen. Retribution and Protection Paladins are just badly designed and won't work regardless of how much mana your throw at them and Enhancement is limited by the number of debuffs.
---
Specs might help. Can you play in non populated parts of BFA?
---
A reminder that during Vanilla -- even late Vanilla at the height of "PvExile", where raiders could transfer from PvP to PvE but not vice versa, so raiders all rerolled on PvP to maximize the number of guilds they could app to even if they hated PvP -- something like 70% of all WoW players played on PvE servers. That means that even when there was a strong incentive for knowledgeable and motivated players to pick PvP over PvE, most players still picked PvE.
---
Maybe you haven't played Vanilla much but there is some very engaging pve rotations I take it you haven't played a Hunter, Druid, Rogue or Hunter...
---
Won't happen unless layering can be heavily abused to accelerate the leveling.
---
You could still Vanish spells in Cataclysm, but with the current batching window interrupts are incredibly unrealiable. Fake casting also unreliable. It lags the game in places that aren't combat. How they are currently implementing batching is not exactly as it was in Vanilla and it causes more harm to the game. Definately needs to be readjusted at least. 
---
Also keep that in mind a 400 ms lag is much more noticable when you have 20 ping, in vanilla the average good ping was 120-160.
---
You can double gouge or sheep or vanish on private servers and there is no 400 ms lag there, the game feels much smoother.
---
I don't know about the gpu but you don't need to buy bfa to play classic. All you need is an active sub
---
4 hunter / 4 rogues
---
Classic requirements are much lower, so if you run BFA bad, you should be able to run Classic good. Plus you don't have to buy BFA, DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON BFA. All you need is a monthly subscription.
---
Could someone explain me, what is the upper bar with the spells?
---
Especially considering they are a top tier raid dps.
---
private servers got us where we are today, ty pservers
---
I'm no stranger to playing non-optimal specs myself, by the way. I insisted on playing Survival through most of Cata for BGs and even arenas. MM was probably the better spec for PvP at that point, but I just had more fun with Survival. I dont regret it at all, though! Just have fun with it.
---
&gt; That’s without a fresh server or with any hiccups server side.
---
Actually, no. We've been running bots on the server to simulate launch day congestion based on how many players were seen per Layer in the stress tests. We even have bots and support staff playing the other faction that will attempt (and usually succeed) to gank you in contested zones. We've played around with the idea of simulating server crashes too, but are waiting to witness the next stress test before making that decision.
---
&gt; Grouping helps some. I think it’s slightly exaggerated.
---
Grouping helps a ton. That's why you saw all the streamers doing Scarlet Monastery over and over to go from 30 to 40. Yes, they had much more powerful gear, but Joan spent 21.5 hours /played during that time and our fresh level 30's can do the same in under 18 hours.
---
Joana also spent a whopping 9.5 hours to go from 58 to 59. We have that in under 3.
---
There are several more instances where time gets shaved both because of the bonus experience from dungeons, but also because of the quest gear you get for dungeons when you're out doing routes that are better than his.
---
All told we have routinely bested Joana's times by at least 18% on both the beta, the stress tests, and on testing server, for all classes.
---
I’m gonna hank your ass
---
Same
---
Good thing they wait till august 27 so the heat wave is going away plus you can enjoy your last summer
---
For people who want additional information on the Mage leveling or any other class, I suggest to visit the website at the origin of most of this information : https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/mage/leveling-1-60/
---
&gt; Even with infinite mana, something like Paladin tanking just isn't viable in raids. They had to completely overhaul the class in TBC to turn them into tanks.
---
This is literally not true.
---
The impactful changes to Paladins in TBC included mana replenishment from incoming heals, mana replenishment from the tank blessing, and hand of righteousness. They added new talent slots deeper in the trees but these are the ones that completely fixed tanking for Paladins with the seal/judge system intact before wrath changed it again. 
---
Thats mp5 and a taunt. There were some mechanical changes to redoubt and reckoning but those were not hugely impactful to the playstyle of the class. 
---
Adding an AQ style book for Blessing of Sanctuary that adds a replenish mana on dodge/block/parry would mean Paladins could use full mitigation gear and reach gear parity with warriors in vanilla since they would no longer be stuck using Deathbone for the MP5. 
---
Blizzard did exactly this type thing with AQ to introduce a later rank of both Blessing of Might and Blessing of Wisdom, as well as later ranks for several other classes. 
---
There would still be an outstanding need for the taunt and perhaps a wrath style buff of spell damage from stam or str to increase threat output but in general if a mob is bouncing hits off Holy Shield it is stuck to the Paladin like glue regardless of what else is going on.
---
So no, no overhaul required. Just AQ type book ranks for Sanctuary and maybe a class quest for Hand of Righteousness similar to the class quest for Redemption. That would be legit.
---
It still feels like a stretch. I’m as curious as anyone to see the process play out. There is only 120 hours mon-fri. And that’s assuming the servers come online perfect at 12am Monday, and that’s NA
---
That's the plan. Not only does it give you rep the fastest, but it also gives the raid the chance at BoE epics.
---
Maybe just no free time you know? Lol imagine thinking playing a game a certain way makes you a man
---
[Priest](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8bulw/created_a_reference_wallpaper_for_priests/)
---
SM/ruin is probably the only one in the game that keeps nearly full effectiveness in everything.  Other classes can go hybrid but they sacrifice a lot more than warlocks have to.
---
Some people haven't connected money and reality yet
---
Yes it does. Literally the second game is 5-0
---
It literally can't happen under a minute you spend two minutes before the game even fucking starts.
---
You can buy them from different vendors IRL too. Most common are "Grocery Stores" and "Convenience Stores". Sometimes you can also find them on eBay.
---
There's that foam shit that all the cosplayers make their costumes with it's pretty good and easy to work with
---
I never say I was salty, I just said that most world pvp fights, from my pov of a priest leveling alone, tends to be higher level people running at you in a moment of weakness so they are sure to win the fight.   
---
When that happens I just come back and move on, I also don't take advantage of reversed situations since I don't see the honor in it.
---
You don't need to be on a pvp server to fight in different faction cities...
---
You can sure try. Doubt it tho.
---
/shrug because there's people who want to pretend that getting RNG results from spells and abilities means they have skill.
---
&gt; PvE server 
---
Care bear.
---
That sounds classic and very fun
---
If an ele shaman was keeping up with your locks and mages I’m not sure they were even using their abilities
---
Can confirm that is/was super helpful.
---
Yes a RESTO shaman though not an Enhancement shaman who nets a dps loss even totem twisting.
---
well shit
---
Hybrid dps, considering +dmg for everyone else:
---
Shadow priest &gt; feral &gt; enhance / elemental &gt; ret &gt; balance.
---
I'm not putting down retribution paladins. I like them. I would take one to a raid or dungeon. But a lot of people seem to base retribution dps in a vacuum, like they consider full tier 2, every possible consumable, and disregard that even rets, hell even mages, have to spend time decursing and related.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
Lol you sound like a neet who is jealous
---
Re-Tard
---
That's not the biggest issue. There is a diminishing return on the amount of green house gases that in the atmosphere and the rate of photon absorption. Magmadar and only have one traq shot with people in greens is.
---
That has no use to me, I'm fueled by rage.
---
You might have only one or two bis for your current gear level but when you get rid of the garbage just filling that slot you feel on top of the world.   Same with how farming for crafted gear feels, this game has lost a lot of it's personal accomplishment with just giving you epics left and right.
---
By that logic they should've neither held the stress test nor implemented the internal layering cooldown, because "they didn't say anything for some time".
---
Iron grenades for pvp are stupid amazing.
---
WoW is kind of a slow game, on pservers, Id often be playing 1 and leveling professions/running/flying on another. I always wanted to be doing something while I was flying. I actually never used multibox software to play them together, although I did run my alts through low level dungeons.
---
My plan is to solo level to 60, then dualbox my next alts. I dont plan on paying for 5 accs.
---
Except you don't know the number of servers per region. This hasn't been announced. It might be the way you say, but it might not. Please rephrase your language to use words like "probably" instead of being so matter of fact on something you are guessing on.
---
But... dps warriors wear leather and pallys wear cloth?
---
the person that made the video, a warrior had multiple people compare the old video and skills to what is in the beta and they both had blood, it wasn't removed there person making the thread just had a knee jerk reaction to what he felt was different but was wrong.
---
Sweet! Anyone know if there’s something similar for Warriors?
---
&gt;Koreans 
---
&gt;ST **Viet'Nam**
---
wut?
---
hmmm, I actually am not sure. I think that bosses don't despawn for quite some time so, it all goes to the Raid Leader, but since I have been doing Classic Dungeons for ages, simple go is &gt;
---
U kill a boss, u bid/roll/loot council it, while continuing to fight the trash mobs before next boss.. aside of Retail, in actual Classic u have like 4543534 mobs, so plenty of time to get the items distributed.. Oh ye, since MC is the 1st Raid, clearing MC ,early on, haha :)  dont expect to see that without actually having the gear and esp the FR items which means, u loot as soon as u kill boss and u upgrade ur FR so u can actually survive till next boss etc..  cheerios    p.s  MC is usually cleared w/o buffs and full of experienced ppl in 2h
---
Agree. This is the way it should be, not some arbitrary number assigned to your gear and the sum of those numbers is how "well geared" you are.
---
Prot warriors and pvp healers I guess lol
---
It's rough starting out but not the end of the world if you lose agro on a mob especially if you have high level party members.  Defensive stance gives you more agro and shouts give agro as well.  Mages and rogues are amazing since they can cc a mob.  My first dungeon since I started Tanking recently I had a shaman that was level 18 or so in RFC while I was 15.  He ended up Tanking the dungeon partly with his shield and I had a mage automatically sheeping ranged mobs.  It was beautiful.  You just have to not panic when things get a little out of control.
---
Reality check: the beta wasnt made for you and your hype problems. Just dont look at any wow stuff for abit if you are having hype issues.
---
 Beta is to test the game and fix bugs.
---
Ugh. You're telling me. 400 dollar cricut and she tries to charge people 10 dollars for a bottle like that after putting 8-10 hours of work into it. No matter how many times I explain to her that she's working for like .50 cents an hour at that rate.
---
Spriest and 3 warlocks gets my world pvp vote.
---
Mages can make you some
---
I want this so much. If anyone finds a link please let me know.
---
No idea what patch it was. It may have been 2.0. I've only looked for about 30 seconds but the oldest comment on the wowhead page is - 
---
Spl4sh3r on 2008/12/11 (Patch 3.0.3)
---
Not having the Eternal Quintessence allows one person to douse all seven runes without having to wait for the cooldown since going to Azshara and getting a new Aqual Quintessence is faster than waiting for the 1 hour cooldown on the Eternal one.
---
Obviously 3.0.3 is not a relevant patch date, but there are no older comments, so it was after 1.11 but before 3.0.3 - could be 1.12 (in which case it may stay that way for classic) or it could be a way later change, tbc or wotlk.
---
1.6 added some updated T1 set art but did not update T2 models yet. Any videos you see from before 1.9 with T2 models are from the PTR.

They're the same type of people who prefer loot to be given to them in a chest rather than earned in a fight. I think retail would be a great fit for them instead of them trying to make classic like retail.

After the last boss there is a pearl you can click to get a buff. Besides the Dwarf, is there a way to get to the front of the instance? I'm not on the beta but curious if we would have to run all they way back through the instance to reset.
---
Not everyone does it. I'd say most RPers aren't "in character" all the time, but generally speaking you'll find people out roleplaying storylines and stuff like that in the world. It's pretty fun and nifty. I like reading people's rp profiles/bios for their characters, and if I like 'em, I tend to whisper them to tell them so.
---
I wouldn't think so. I think wand spec is useful in PvE to prevent going oom so often. Since you'll be dying frequently in PvP and using more spells, you probably wouldn't get much benefit.
---
I'm not an expert; I just threw the image together.
---
Not ah, but, my friend would occationally set up a trade to buy something through tradechat, when they meet up for trading he would removie a zero from the agreed price in the tradewindow right before he believed the other person would accept the trade.

It was really stupid and certanly not allowed, but i saw him do it multiple times...

Back then it wasn't "guilds getting their Thunderfury" it was 1 guy who had an obsession so intense that he had to get a Thunderfury for himself. I played vanilla wow every day since the midnight release. I stood outside gamestop when I was 14 to play wow on day 1. I can assure you that players were not as devoted and way less informed than players are now. Back during vanilla days, there was people playing from day 1 that didn't even make it to 60 in a year. Look at asmongold's mom ding 60 video. *That* was half of the wow community back then. Now when classic comes out, your guild is going to laugh at you if you don't hit 60 in a month.
---
I'll part with the consensus here and say I kinda like it. It is a bit cheesy, I wouldn't share it with the world like that maybe, but it reminds me of the old style box and guide artwork styles you frequently see on fantasy games in the past.  Especially fits the Warlock motif... I'm down with this level of nerdy/fun font only because this is the right content to use it on.
---
Let's be real, you don't need high readability for this, it's an at-a-glance reference sheet not a narrative... and it's just as much about the flavour and RPfeels you get from seeing the plan for your Lock's badass progression than it is about info. 
---
My 2 cents :). Love it OP.
---
Nothing, please stay in your Mormon bubble
---
It showed the last 5 seconds of a 5cap game. What does that prove exactly? And I've ranked with the bracket 1 players; we farmed AB. Different tweaks might make it different from pserver to pserver (some places have weird queue rules), but I still see no evidence for your 6minute claim.
---
This is the real test; How big ofa percentage stays after most players have reached max level?
---
For average player questing is typically faster, if you have stacked groups of 5 great players that know how to optimize pulling, then dungeons is either faster or at worst on par and those players have the advantage of making sure they all get there at the same speed.  
---
It doesn't do you much good if all your hunters and mages and rogues hit 60 a day before your paladins and warriors.
---
Correct. 305 mining is only for AQ20/40, 315 Skinning is for UBRS/MC
---
I really wouldn't try to compete with mages for these spots at launch. Plenty of places will have good mob density but contain casters/ranged mobs that mages will be steering clear of.
---
vanilla titanforging
---
This so much, how many things in trailers have you seen (be it actual gameplay or not) that are not in the actual game. Using a preview/launch trailer as evidence is utterly ridiculous.
---
I feel like most RPers aren't hanging out on Reddit, but at the same time, I've noticed most retail RPers don't want to "start over" with Classic. I'm wondering how many RPers we're gonna get.
---
(I'm the same, though, I'd like to roll ally, rp.)

Coldrage dagger from RFD  
---
Sword of omen from SM

---
Your words speak for themself. Just roll PvE and stfu, calling those people chickens doesn't help your argument
---
Ahh yes the little engine that couldn’t.
---
&gt;That is why in the videos I linked only a few people had tier 2 new models and not the entire raid because it wasn't on farm.
---
So you're saying that 2 different versions of the same item existed during the games run?
---
I wish you weren't so awkward, bud.
---
PVP for life
---
What should I stack? just int and stam?
---
The trailer video was produced by Blizzard. They can do whatever they like with their internal servers. It's not evidence of anything for the live game. They had teased the updated T2 art for a long, long time before patch 1.9.
---
&gt; I'm also the type of person who will always play a game on "hard" or "murderbutt" difficulties, and really can't enjoy the "easy" or "normal" difficulty setting.
---
That's not even remotely comparable.

If you are a warrior, you can run from shadow priests 100% of the time. They have no way to remove hamstring and have no slows so you can just run away.
---
Blizzard used to sell them online at their website, I think they were initially around $20 but it went on clearance and I got it for $10 was happy I snagged one, check to see if they restock
---
They managed to make this worse somehow.   Amazing.

As someone who tried in Vanilla, I'd say not very.

As a warlock, should I soulstone the tank, or the healer?  Also, please explain why, so that I may learn something new.

Alternatively you could man up

&gt;By them not changing the t2 that had already been dropped from old visuals to the new ones?

Doesn't that imply that 2 different versions of the same item existed during the game?

Do you have a citation for that? I couldn't find anything on it when I looked and EU was excluded for the last stress test

?
---
Pally*
---
Fuck layering
---
Yeah, good point. Rethinking it i think something like "from levels 1-20 you are layered" or "first 3 weeks are layered"
---
It only increases the effectiveness of the totem. So you gain 30% on the extra 315 ap the wf hit is based on. Im not good with math but as some other guy already commented in this thread this additional 94 ap translates to around 25 dps per warrior.
---
I'm sorry...
---
We now *know* the sub numbers because of a 4chan leak..?

Someone on 4chan says they're a fired blizz dev, and that's proof to you..? 4chan...

Here is a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16l2kJPM0D0  showing a mage in ZG, sometimes getting very close to mobs and not taking blows.

fix your shit blizzard
---
Multi-boxing gets a little old.    
---
Sure, you can insta-kill people in PvP, but it is pretty easy to counter (note the edits in all the video montages). For example one AoE fear or a Frost Nova can completely ruin the sync. In an ideal world you'd have different toons with different roles (like tank/healer) but there's little consistency between caster/melee abilities, and macros can only do so much.   
---
ISBoxer is much nicer software than we had back in the day. But it cannot solve the core issues, which boil down to running a foul of anti-cheat (since you essentially need to completely automate actions, not just redirect keypresses). I don't blame others for wanting to try multi-boxing, but few multi-boxers stick with it for too long because the fun is fleeting.
---
Here is a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16l2kJPM0D0  showing a mage in ZG, sometimes getting very close to mobs and not taking melee attacks. 
---
Not saying this proves anything one way or another, just info for infos sake
---
I mean obviously you roll *need*.
---
Now we all need a link, so we can benefit off your wife’s hard work and buy these bottles.
---
Not everyone understands how +wep skill works. Sometimes they sell for prices more attuned to "its purple soooo 500g i guess"
---
Also after the murloc boss.
---
Maybe, maybe not.  Seems like the shoe fits ("I was just joking guys!"), or maybe you were just the sucker that finally annoyed me enough.
---
Does it not function like totem twisting?  Unless the buff falls off if you leave the group (don't see why it would since it persists even if you replace the totem), once windfury is applied to the melee group, they should keep the buff for 10 seconds.
---
So, drop a wf totem to give melee group the buff, after five seconds it will pulse again to reapply so switch groups and drop mana tide right after wf reapplies, so you drop mana tide while melee has 10 seconds of wf buff, then get switched back once the 12 second Mana tide is done and redrop wf to trigger the immediate pulse to reapply the buff?
---
That way your melee only lose the buff for ~2 seconds, so not really much of a loss.
---
Maybe something like World of GTA
---
Oddly, it always feels like a downgrade when I hit plate at 40.  Gear stats actually go down with the first few plate items vs mail.  You have to start gearing up in plate just because dungeon mobs hit harder, but you don't do it all at once.
---
So are we going to have the 1.12 API or the 8.2 API?
---
That video is mislabeled. The poster misremembered the date.
---
The guy who downranked shadowbolt?
---
Thanks for the confirm :)
---
Many of these gear appearances can actually still be acquired.
---
I don't remember when they gave bonuses for wearing the right category armor but this is another painful thing in vanilla.  The itemization was awful.
---
I will see if she's interested. Been trying to get her to sell her creations for a while lol.
---
I always just wait to see what everyone else rolls if its boe.
---
If its a BoP item from a boss, I'll greed it to sell/DE if I don't need it.
---
Yeah I sent a mod mail to have it be reviewed because that shit is absurd
---
&gt; Also, im scared that when classic will get released it will be a huge success at first but the hype will die down and servers will become semi-empty within a couple of months
---
I'm not.
---
They probably will.
---
There is no bug with his shields, his combat log merely does not show full absorbs and he is spell batching an auto attack into the same tick as the ambush.  
---
Pause at exactly 26sec.  You see on his SCT absorb, entering combat, special -533(276 Absorbed), Ice Barrier Fades, +crippling
---
That absorb is the auto attack that hit at the same moment at the ambush, if it hit for 160 it would exactly add up to the missing amount on his absorb shield.  Notice the combat log does not track the full absorb, so you cannot see how much it hit for.  
---
Same thing with the mana shield at 9sec into the video,  absorb before the ambush, this one is missing 180 damage.  
---
You can see the lack of combat log reporting super clearly at 18sec, the rogue gets too close and auto attacks you see absorb in SCT, but see no update in the mages combat log.
---
Yes that's the point, if you can read english you can read any book in english.  So sure while playing a rogue in retail might not be exactly the same as playing a rogue in classic it's hardly going be like stepping into a completely unfamiliar experience.
---
Thanks for not being matter of fact. It's a useful skill, embrace it.
---
I played as prot in vanilla and also on private servers for the last 3 years, I ran all the endgame dungeons @ around lv55 in greens and blues, even strat UD. I did better than most tier warriors. It's just about your group composition and strategies. The paladin is a class most haven't mastered and it will be interesting, to say the least, in classic as most haven't had time to learn the anti meta style of tanking. Ideally I'd love 2-3 pallies of each spec, then 2-3 AoE caster DPS.
---
Rp PvP. Imagine starting a literal crusade by just being enough of an asshole in Redridge. God is tempting me with this thought
---
That stuff that is 250'990 years old and has an expiry date in the package? Hell No. It's not even that salty.
---
Well... Yes, just doing it in terms of hitting a button and having all characters do X is not skill intensive. However, doing any kind of half-way demanding content as a multiboxer is actually very hard indeed.
---
Blizzard could have prevented this from the beginning. If high level characters would scale down to the level range in lets say Redridge, it would be way more challenging and fun to engage in wpvp.
---
Age has nothing to do with it.  I still curbstomp people in PvP.  I just know the downfalls of it.  Enjoy STV and Plaguelands.  Let me know how those work out for ya.
---
Shaman! For the Horde! (Zug-Zug y'all!)
---
Yes but the meme is poking fun at the fact that melee complains the second the buff drops. So even if it drops for 2 seconds, they'll still complain. That's the joke.
---
You just use soulstones on other people. You can use one every 30 minutes.
---
Wow, nice system!
---
I just need to control where  i am, where my friends are, a timer for my layering,multiple timers for multiple friends layers, dungeons reseting timers, phases reseting timers, levels reseting timers, PVP reseting timers... it seems quite simple just to avoid a few days of caos! :D
---
Yeah sorry, I meant to say Japanese.
---
Link please, I need to buy
---
The complaint is always "Its not fun getting ganked when I'm trying to do stuff." Well then take a seat because you're just like everyone else or you dont like wpvp. Even people that do like wpvp, like myself, of course hate getting ganked. But that's part of the fun of it. Sure its frustrating, but it makes the world unpredictable and feels *alive*. Questing in STV feels like you just got deployed to Vietnam and you have to constantly watch your back for Charlies. It prevents the game from becoming stale and static. Every time you leave a town it could be a massacre.
---
But then eventually you get to 60. Eventually you stop having to watch *your* back constantly because its *others* that are watching *their* backs for *you*. Then once you have some gear you can lay the smackdown on others in the open world and people either stop messing with you or they bring some friends to challenge you. Then you bring your friends. Now suddenly it's a guild war. You've got a raid formed and you're fighting another raid. Maybe multiple guilds get involved and you form some guild alliances and some guilds become enemies.
---
It makes the world dynamic and breathes life into a game that otherwise would be nothing more than waiting for the weekly reset to raid.
---
Damn, you right.
---
Going PvP here! If you're going PvE...
---
I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE GAME A LOT! :D
---
Jesus fucking christ. You can't possibly do AB in two mins. It's two mins before the gates even fucking open. It's one minute before the caps activate. It takes time to run across the map.
---
What you're suggesting is IMPOSSIBLE.
---
This is an insane conversation. You started off saying AB is more, when it's less even on AB weekend. You then said its done in two minutes when the game doesn't even start then. Just admit you're wrong.
---
Just waiting for the druid one now.
---
Not sure you would want to invest 22 points into enchance just for improved windfury but its a possibility.
---
Paliegh*
---
Actually, communication studies show that softening your opinions with words like "i think" and "probably" reduce the effectiveness of your argument, even if you're correct. It's the first thing they teach you not to do on the debate team.
---
You're clearly not even reading what I'm writing. Have fun raging blindly into the wind.
---
Like... Blizzard didn't code it into the client when the ported classic, it was already in the 1.12 code. What more evidence do you need?
---
......multiple times
---
Ah thanks man, I appreciate it. The embarrassing part is I've seen that before but somehow missed the July dates.
---
Okay. It still wasn't added until 1.9. Most players back then were behind the bleeding edge, and most servers didn't unlock AQ for a few months, and even then most guilds still continued to clear BWL while working on AQ.
---

YOU WILL LAUGH NOW.
---
Dual boxing isn't too hard.   Easier with a setup like ISboxer, but I've generally just used hotkeynet because it's free.  Only downside is it trivializes content and I don't really like that.
---
However, I'd recommend you dual box a mage instead of a shaman as an alt. Having a portal bitch is pretty nice and shaman should be able to keep aggro over a mage.
---
&gt; baffling to me how anyone thought sharding was a good idea
---
Product integrity dies the second you let beancounters make decisions to benefit profits. This holds true across literally every industry. They're not happy enough making profit. It becomes about making "more profit." It's short sighted but they don't give a shit because company execs at that level have no loyalty. They make their buck and jump ship before anyone realizes how their bad decisions have harmed the product and company reputation.
---
Lmao holy shit this took a turn to hostility
---
I *need* that gold
---
That....still doesn't make any sense.
---
They should shut down beta already as this looks bad for the game even when there is a lot of reasons to the beta be in this state right now. I mean, the start of it with all the streamers doing shit around really hyped people up for it, but now this is "gone" and when you see streams its kinda sad because the zones are empty with only the random stream sniper appearing sometimes.
---
It's actually a good advertise for layering as nobody will want their server empty like the beta. lol
---
One thing that really bothers me is they never allowed people enough to make a server full so we don't know yet what the limit will be. We just know that zones have some weird limitations with layering taking place where it shouldn't and sometimes not at all, but would be cool if they REALLY opened a stress test for EVERYONE with a client installed, for free.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8bulw/created_a_reference_wallpaper_for_priests/
---
Wrath? I think for the armor bonus. Pretty sure alot of BIS was still off primary armor type in BC. The itemization wasn't always bad for primary specs. There was just alot of random ass shit all over everything. And due to the random aspects of some gear it became BIS for people it was never intended for. Especially early on, if you look at the tier sets they're a mess before they got patched over time. Hybrid itemization is bad, 100% i'll give you that.
---
1. SM/Ruin lock, not many points you really have to switch around. SL is better to have, but SM/Ruin is still really solid
---
2. MM/Surv Hunter, you do sacrifice a tiny bit of pet damage for PvP talents, but its barely noticeable
---
3. Shockadin, youll sacrifice a few PvP talents, but nothing major
---
After that, theres quite a few viable Paladin, Shaman and Druid hybrid specs that dont sacrifice too many talents, but are pretty suboptimal.
---
looks like a bug.  shouldn't cities always be on the same layer as its continent?
---
as a reminder, this is still beta with new technology.  please remain calm reddit
---
If you walk into a zone that is around your level, you can pick up quests and start doing them.
---
There are some breadcrumb quests to lead you to a zone that you'll miss out on, and you might miss out on some quest chains.
---
If you want to do everything, then look up a quest guide for the zone before you go there. It's not necessary, but it can help.
---
No one cares.
---
the problem is that you don't see getting ganged / pvp as a real part of the game but something that holds you back from it (pveing to death)
---
It may depend when you play too. If you leveled during the initial surge, with everyone else... it's not bad. When I got there, server was well established with a huge population, and I distinctly remember a hunter with a high warlord's recurve (very distinctive model) with several friends running around level ~50 zones ganking all day. The Burning Steppes were very popular with them. All of my friends gave up on Nost when they got to that area and tried to level there. You basically couldn't use normal lvl 50 questing areas. I ground out a good portion of 50-60 by killing mobs instead because of it. Those guys were specifically doing it to get / maintain high warlord. I've heard Alliance did the same thing.
---
I would definitely stick enhance until mid 50s when I was ready to start spamming dungeons for gear.  
---
Both elemental/resto builds kinda suck to level with.  Elemental is very mana intensive and you have no base pushback resistance.  Spell power gear doesn't really exist until level 60, and without it you do not upfront enough with elemental to be able to kill most mobs before they get into your melee.  With the 30pts elemental you can at least pull and get a 2nd lightning bolt off before something is in melee.  After whatever mob gets into melee both specs are going to be nearly the same because casting into knockback is super annoying and slow.  There is that talent that gives push resist after being crit, but mobs only hve a 5% chance to crit, so that is much more a pvp talent.  You can kite, but the mana and time cost of doing so is such that it is typically faster not to do so.
---
In melee you searing totem, keep up lightning shield, flame shock, and auto attack the thing to death like you are a poor mans enhancement shaman.  You can use a 1h and shield with flame tongue, or you still can wear a staff if you have one with high dps and WF buff it.  I remember resurgence rod from the mara quest being super good for caster shaman melee, and at 60 once pvp is going for awhile, ironbark staff is perfect for the role.
---
Hand of edward the odd is an expensive boe, but I mentioned it with that 21/0/30 spec because you'll end up meleeing things to death quite a bit, so you should have ample opportunity to get the procs off.
---
&gt; btw noone wants their "optimisations"
---
Considering how much I used to cheat in Vanilla-Cata, I'm 100% OK with them optimizing the game.
---
Ehh debuff limit still helps rogues, locks and warriors immensely. I would say nature resist and Mana issues are the most dire changes needed to make hybrids more optimal.
---
the only exception to that might be the Wrath shoulders
---
they look like 2 giant pizza cutters
---
You think the class revamps weren't big changes? Guess you didn't play vanilla
---
Pallys can tank dungeons very well. I would join any 5 man with a pally tank.
---
Kargoz did a stream of Pally warlock duo leveling and he tanked dungeons too. he also had a lot of fun because he could do a lot more than just stand there and hold aggro.
---
Or wow in general. Guild leaders are basically miniature dictators. They appoint officers to keep all the other members in check, farming consuambles made mandatory, force/encourage attuning other citizens-i mean guildmates- for MC and Onyxia etc to fill the army - i mean raid's- ranks... They pick and choose who gets loot (wealth), favoritism is rampant, class discrimination mandatory, dissenters are exiled permanently....
---
yeah it just baffles me that people buy that stuff 
---
I mean I would totally believe that sub numbers are down but 4chan....
---
yeah not hard evidence
---
I *am* using data to backup my claims. It's you that thinks the number of realms will be different simply because you want them to be.

I debate other people's desires and opinions for a living. So, I've got it covered, but thanks anyway.
---
raids in classic are easier than raids in retail though lmao
---
Thanks for the priest pvp tips man! I actually didn't think of levitate much when it comes to wpvp, so keeping light feathers stocked is def going to be a priority then. I'm still debating it a bit, but that gives me more of an idea about Priests and wpvp.

"Also, im scared that when classic will get released it will be a huge success at first but the hype will die down and servers will become semi-empty within a couple of months, what are your thoughts?"
---
thats what blizz expects too, thats why they are using a small number of servers and layering to hopefully prevent this
---
whaaat EKSDEE
---
Yup I just read that - I stand corrected.
---
if they sent me an invite id be playing.
---
Mages are prot paladins dream DPS. Salvs, bops, holy shield, it's AoE heaven. No CC, balls to the wall. I often use the frost mage when they slow mobs down and kite holding threat just consecrating and if it gets to crazy I'll even off heal lol.
---
oh, just killing the pet. That's...evil.
---
=)
---
Middle of the night for EU, so NA population should be playing. Beta is just dead because there's no reason to even play it now until more levels can come out.
---
Leveling an alt in stv, gotta bring the main over just in case.
---
Yeah bud, you can go ahead and guess whatever you want there chief.
---
How is it cringe? WoW has a major impact on many people lives, it’s memorabilia....
---
Prot pal is definitely an uphill battle with the populus, ret aswell. But holy is always welcome even if its just to steal cloth gear and buff the raid
---
I'd probably agree. I remember caster hybrids like Elemental Shaman and boomkin druids having insanely bad mana issues in longer fights.
---
Ele in tbc was pretty had from what I remember.  Was it really better in classic with less tools available?
---
Pve couldnt transfer to pvp originally
---
Thanks for the lesson - greatly appreciated.  I would never say myself in a group, but I definitely do it when I'm out soloing.
---
Sorry, EQ TLP != EQ2. My statement stands. Here's another, nobody gave a shit about EQ2.
---
Web fonts aren't better in flat images, they're useful in development only.
---
ha..Gold. Love it
---
He made a lot of prophecies.
---
Hate it when they crack after 2 weeks....
---
I think you’re greatly underestimating the guilds who are planning to raid in the first/second weeks
---
Getting world firsts are like the WoW olympics

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8cx5s/what_class_are_you_playing_and_why/). 
---
Atleast Warriors are desired for endgame with a fury spec.
---
Paladins, Shaman, and Druids aren't so lucky.
---
With the Raptor Strike macro. Is there a need to add the rank?
---
So I just got back from a 2 weeks long vacation and to my surprise classic is downloadable. But when i try to login no servers are available. Are the servers just down atm? Or am I able to download classic in advance? FWIW I do not have an active subscription to retail, maybe that´s the issue?
---
I'm pretty sure that kick was an illegal move.
---
Even in TBC or Wrath the batching was never this bad, and in Vanilla the batching worked a lot different than it does now on Beta. Sure the window was the same but the current implementation is just terrible.
---
TIL

I responded to the wrong one.

---
*What?*
---
I've heard Battle Shout can generate flat aggro upon cast. Is that true?
---
Don't forget their "We have enough testers, no more invites will be sent out" message as well. Its their own fault.
---
gUyS thEY fiXED laYerING

Link me the vid of someone dinging 60 in 6 days and buying an epic mount on the same day
---
For those wondering, the Retail raider is the guy in the red and blue surcoat.
---
Holy pally? 
---
Feral druid? 
---
Goodluck killing either of those before reinforcements show up to steamroll you.
---
I really hope that nazi shit doesn't make it to Classic.
---
I mean the scaling on shield is pretty awefull. It's like 10% or something. Some of them don't even scale at all.
---
\#itwasgoodenougformygrandfatherdammitanditsgoodenoughforme!
---
The only thing I would hate about PVE is farming resources occasionally you just need to kill that guy that’s one node ahead on your route.
---
Didnt know method's raiders were so flexible.
---
He said until the end of phase 1, which could be as long as 3 months.
---
I'm asking you a question and that's how you want to deflect?
---
If you played vanilla and don't think the class changes were significant (as indicated by your previous comment), it shows a big disconnect with the game
---
You’re welcome, hope you are included this time!
---
I have more than one friend, as shocking as it might seem to you that other people do so.
---
WHAT? NINE THOUSAND?
---
OP is european and the servertime in the screenshot is 4am (and servers are in US), so in the middle of the night for US people.
---
Look dragrimmar, on the internet you are allowed to make up shit to complain about, okay? Those damn PvP'ers got him one day 12 years ago and he never let go of the trauma! So just let him have this one for facks sake!
---
lol. love the wrist brace
---
What's qiyou?
---
You could kill a mob in a different area. Why ruin the game to play it?
---
Can you conjure me up a stack? 5 Silver.
---
You should be nicer to people
---
Last time I did a DMT run I thought I was with a mage and a rogue, but it was just Ol' Willy Patches and the town thief
---
You aren't using data numb nuts. You are making an educated guess based on a few random forum posts.
---
You understand the difference between peer reviewed literature and what you call "data", correct?
---
You lack a very basic understanding of how to correctly formulate evidence for an argument. You can claim all you want you do this for a living, yet you fail to realize that you are resorting to a fallacy called "appeal to authority" while you do so. It's irrelevant, and is actually hurting your argument in this case.
---
I can't remember when Blizzard made shields scale. PW:S would scale off healing power, Ice Barrier later scaled off Frost power. I just remember Ice Barrier being a 2 minute cooldown a long time ago which made is so useless
---
Mana shield doesn't scale and is an exact amount. There shouldnt be any tooltip errors with it. Ice barriers does have a small coefficient.
---
super cool video
---
not sure it fits your title at all
---
Yeah, I've seen some horde player killing Yeti's minding their own business. Pulled too many, but doing well. Going to pull it off. Then I see a rogue sneaking up to wait behind them. When the horde is about to pull it off the rogue killed them and stealths away. 
---
I don't get it. You're a piece of shit if you do that. I get no joy from that shitty action, nor see how anyone can. It's not some "faction war" bs, it's just someone doing a cheap shot. I look down on that kind of behaviour. 
---
I've seen Alliance players going through attacking every low level horde they can, hoping to get some wpvp going on. I think wpvp is a waste. That's what a BG is for.
---
yeah ok buddy
---
They've said what they're going to say. There's no benefit to Blizzard in saying anything else unless they reverse their stance, which they won't do.
---
&gt;  they think short terms. They know the hype is huge, so they don't care about the servers 1 year from now.
---
The decision to keep the EU playerbase together *is* a long-term plan. It's entire purpose is to ensure realms have a healthy and stable population after the launch hype dies down and the tourists leave.
---
&gt; Here and there, people will try to organize themselves to be on their native language server
---
This is fruitless planning. If Blizzard was going to release enough EU servers to allow any one language (besides English) to take over as a majority, they would release a realm in that language. The decision suggests all of Europe (minus Russia), is only getting at most 5 realms (2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP).
---
This guy fucking loves to suck his own dick and toot his own horn.
---
&gt; I like to think a podcast made for people who are "bad" at WoW would stand out more
---
This might interest you:  
---
There's an episode of Countdown to Classic where they interview WoW podcasters (I can't find it and I've already spent a few dollars of mobile data looking) that mentions an upcoming one focused around someone who hasn't played WoW before.
---
could help enhance go from meme spec to respectable
---
&gt; What they should have done is employ 100 or so people to test WoW classic
---
Also you're assuming that Blizzard don't already have internal testers who have done all this.
---
(hint: Blizzard do have internal testers)
---
&gt; we will collapse down, and we promise we will do this a few weeks in, to a single world per realm, no sharding, none of that going forward.
---
You can listen to him yourself: "We're going to continue that process over the first few weeks, until eventually we will collapse down, and we promise we will do this a few weeks in, to a single world per realm, no sharding, none of that going forward."  
---
https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=360
---
&gt; Diablo, Overwatch, Starcraft, WoW, Hearthstone, Warcraft...
---
You made my case for me. 
---
* D3 is shit compared to D2, which was made by a completely different company that Blizzard purchased and relabeled as "Blizzard North" and is no longer with the company.  
---
* Overwatch had a great system and it cannibalized itself for SJWs because they refused to implement role queue and competitive features.  
---
* Starcraft 2 is dead.  
---
* WoW is literally rebooting the game from scratch because retail is so fucking bad. It used to be the king of online gaming.  
---
* Hearthstone is fucking terrible, are you kidding me? Go look at the sub.  
---
* Warcraft is dead. RTS's in general are a dying genre. And again, you're referencing games they made 20 years ago when they DIDN'T suck ass.  
---
If you love modern Blizzard so much, go back to retail retard.
---
I think the idea is moreso that the Shaman is using Mana Tide for himself. Although if we're going to be pedantic about effective Mana Tide usage, you should be moving the Shaman to another group, have him use Mana Tide, and then move him back to the melee's once it has expired.
---
Ret used to be viable as a healer for blessing of kings...
---
pvp is always pushing things
---
regardless of your attitude, you'd always want to have some advantage, so power-leveling can't be avoided in pvp world. no chill fishing either. all in all, it's always adrenaline. and i just want to sleep without dreaming about swinging crits at AV and waking up tired lol
---
so i definitely will roll on both types
---
those t1 shoulders are just awful lmao
---
We're going with 1.12 for every class, why should one get preferential treatment? 
---
Their dps would still suck in PvE, and in PvP elemental was always better.
---
I can't speak for everyone, but I can offer my own perspective, having multiboxed for around multiple years now.
---
It is just simply very convenient to get to log in and play at your own convenience.  I only have a few hours here and there in the evenings that I can sink in to gaming and even those are erratic, so there is simply no chance I can commit to raid times or being on consistently. However, as a multiboxer I just log in and instantly my whole party/raid is ready to go do whatever I feel like doing, whenever it suits me. I also have no drama in-game. No rage quitters. I don't inconvenience others if I have to randomly go AFK due to my kid waking up and so on and so on. I'm sure you can see how this can be an appealing experience.  Some want to contribute an anti-social nature to multiboxing and I can see why they would think that. However, multiboxing and social interaction in-game are in no way mutually exclusive. I've met some of my longest time WoW friends as a direct result of multiboxing. And I am free to partake in any normal activity on a single character ***if I choose to do so***. I just don't have to.
---
Another overlooked part of multiboxing is generally just how fun working on your team can be. Hunting for upgrades where you can find them, improving on your rotations, mixing and matching different specs and classes, finding synergies for them, adding stuff to your setup, configuring how you deal with thing like healing,  individual character cooldowns or specific encounter mechanics... It's all really interesting stuff. I would say I spend about as much time just fiddling with stuff and reworking different aspects of my teams as I do actually playing.
---
TL;DR: To not have to rely on others to play, and because it is great fun.
---
It would help but most of these builds also suffered from other issues. Getting gear was very hard. Your class tier was for one spec only. E.G. priest gear was all +healing so useless for a shadow priest. As mentioned the debuff limit dose not help, and finally some class even with gear and infinity mana would just not be good. Namely enh and prot pally. Enh damage is just meh period, and prot pallets have no taunt and can not become uncrushable. So they will take a lot of damage and some special raid boss attacks will if they crush 1 shot them
---
Ok this one was actually good lol
---
Shift right clicking auto loot. Not auto loot instead of normal loot option. That came in BC.
---
I would say it's probably more important, since the BOP chest is best in slot until ZG for mages and warlocks where they get the bloodvine set, and that's only if you keep 300 tailoring for the crit bonus.  If you plan to drop tailoring and not raid, the BOP epic is probably even more effective because you will not be replacing it with anything better, pretty much ever (maybe high rank pvp gear, i dont know, but that is easily half a year or more away).
---
Enchanting is not going to be amazing unless you get the endgame patterns, some of which in phase 1 are dungeon or world drops, the rest (the better ones) drop from Molten core bosses, and later on many of the good ones only from raid bosses in AQ and others.  If you dont raid, you lose the opportunity to get any of those good enchants, so your endgame viability with enchanting is actually going to be pretty poor compared to enchanters being fed patterns by their guilds.  If you arent going to raid and be a guild enchanter, I dont think I would recommend enchanting.
---
Skinning/alch is solid, it'll be a great opportunity to make money off the back of raiders who will be buying many of the potions.
---
What you should do will depend ultimately on how fast you want to level and what your goals are with the game.  For example if you plan to go fast, the herbalism/mining skill will not be able to keep up with the zone requirement.
---
&gt;  I think that properties like StarCraft and Overwatch show that they know a great deal about good game design.
---
Starcraft is dead and OW is dying.  
---
&gt; Yes they end up patching them until they aren't as good any more   
---
They end up patching them until they **kill** them. Their good games are pulls of luck. Even look at fucking vanilla WoW. The quests don't make sense. Look up the spider eggs quest in Stonetalon. I love the game, but take your head out of your ass. Classic WoW is addictively fun but Blizzard was lucky, and their inability to continuously improve on their games PROVES that they don't UNDERSTAND good game design.  
---
People always bring up their old games to defend them. Obviously Blizzard was, at one point, an incredible gaming company. Nobody is denying that. But MODERN BLIZZARD is shit.
---
Basically, if your class has the flexibility of doing two roles it's such an asset to you in terms of getting groups. I dislike healing, but I'll sure as shit heal on my shaman if it means getting a group fast. That being said, no one should be forced to play in a way they hate, but if you're able to suck it up and adapt it's a huge benefit.
---
Actually it would make more sense to say he should become more immature and childish. Twitch muscle and quick reactions are traits more commonly associated with small children and the stereotypical 13 year old tough guy talking shit about your mom on Xbox live. 
---
It's infinitely more likely that these hardcore PvPers are small children than grown men.
---
This is highly accurate.
---
&gt; You are making an educated guess based on a few random forum posts.
---
No, I'm basing my assumption on the raw playerbase numbers seen in World of Warcraft. It has nothing to do with other people's thoughts.
---
Do you know how many times logical fallacies get brought up as a defense in a court of law or in a congressional debate?
---
The answer is zero.
---
And if you're *soooo* into logical fallacies, you should probably learn the fallacy fallacy.
---
Like ,aking your healers work overtime, huh?
---
Blizz waited for the heat to die down, and it worked for the most part, this is the first one of these ive seen in a while
---
Interesting, but buffing shamans or paladins will give either faction the advantage in raids and pvp, hurting the faction balance on servers.
---
&gt; and the mage got super mad at me because I was using CoS rather than CoE, because our tank was a shaman.
---
How is any of this relatable?
---
&gt; You think the class revamps weren't big changes?
---
They were part of vanilla WoW. 
---
&gt;If you played vanilla and don't think the class changes were significant (as indicated by your previous comment), it shows a big disconnect with the game
---
# IT WAS PART OF VANILLA WOW
---
1.0 ALL THE WAY TO 1.12 WAS VANILLA WOW
---
Never played Hunter but just read up on the pve rotation. Is it really just using a swing timer and aimed/multi shot?
---
Part of 40 man raiding is constantly recruiting to fill raid spots. A lot of those recruits may not have great gear. We would carry people through MC/BWL to gear up and really start to see how good a player they were, how they fit in with the group personality-wise etc... If someone apped to the guild in full AQ/Naxx gear we were more cautious than an app in mostly blues/a few epics.
---
Exactly this. Classic pop will be small long term and having few servers will make sure people can actually do stuff
---
open the beta!
---
No you see the main issue with that theory is that the amount of soy you would need to guzzle to play PvE makes everything you said wrong
---
You don't have access to the beta. That's the stress test client and to get onto any realm (not online right now), you *do* need an active sub.
---
As long as you can make friends or join a guild there will always be people wanting you to tank.  You might not be the fastest to get gear but people will still be leveling alts or their own mains since you definitely won't be the only player playing 10 hours a week.  It'll just take you a lot longer to get there which if you're enjoying yourself should be absolutely fine.  As long as you follow your gear progression and don't bite off more than you can chew a lot of people will want you.
---
If you are a good shaman your melee group will never have WF downtime

OPEN THE BETA!
---
U gon got banned if they still have the same rules as vanilla 🤔
---
Then why do I see a bunch of people from different realms ?
---
&gt; is supplying the public with the correct amount of mats needed to sustain a higher playerbase.
---
Except the entire purpose of layering is due to the assumption that the temporary playerbase is just that: TEMPORARY. Those 12k players will thin out to 3k players in a few months. That's the entire reason why layering exists. Except now you've got 80 black lotus in the bank from when layering existed. You're rich and you get to control the economy now. Grats.  
---
&gt; It doesn’t matter if a player layer swaps, it will not hurt the economy at all.  
---
You can assume your conclusion all you want, but the fact is that money concentrated among small groups of elite players kills guild competition and layering allows neckbeards to obtain vastly more materials than the server will *eventually* need to get a headstart over the formative economy.
---
It's a meme, don't worry about it lol

---
I used to do the exact same thing in vanilla. I farmed ZG crocs all the time. If you tried that with the current melee leeway system, you'd get insta-gibbed when trying to CoC, let alone Arcane Explosion, which used to be perfectly possible without getting hit.
---
The current system in Classic is broken and urgently needs to be fixed. Spell batching is similarly borked. Especially on the Blizzard slow interaction. It applies FAR later than it should.
---
then at 60 pallys dont get to wear plate anymore lol
---
r/hydrohomies?
---
You must be great at parties
---
if I had to guess I’d pick rogue, mage, priest, warrior
---
Dude they said layering is going to be off in Phase 2, with World Bosses. Seriously how does this even come up in discussions anymore...
---
You talk about how perfectly balanced vanilla's economy was. I remember how frequently teleport hackers and 24/7 botters were running around for months on end. Blizzard's anti-cheat detection was not very good early on as it is now. Was their economy balanced around the botters, or around them not being there? Because odds are, they won't now.
---
Also, there's going to be an absolutely massive material sink with the war effort event of AQ. This is going to erase any and all gains from laying in about 1 hour.
---
Open the beta!
---
&gt; so they don't care about the servers 1 year from now
---
In what world would this be true? Their entire financial success with WoW rides on it being a long-term thing. There's no up-front box cost aside from the first month.
---
The crappy old T2 is how the current WoW tiers looks like lol
---
Plus weren't the lasher's severely nerfed just before BWL launched?
---
That answers nothing.
---
Layering bad.
---
Streamerman also bad.
---
Me angry! Zugzug!
---
This is actually a health advice: remain seated while drinking is the correct way to drink.
---
I heard it in my head as I read your comment
---
Ah. Okay! That must be it! Darn, lol. Was about to start planning my evening after work, hehe.
---
No one cares about proving anything to you lmao.
---
Been using it for 10+ years. It’s not something they easily detect and frankly they don’t care.
---
That might actually really be the case now that I think about it.... it was a rather small RP-PvP server so I guess we simply sucked ass big time. Who would have guessed huh
---
They're gonna get Agility and they're gonna like it.
---
You assumed I was making a claim the server number would be different, I've made no such claim. You aren't very good at reading comprehension.
---
Again, this isn't a court of law, or an academic debate, it's literally a casual discussion on the number of servers in a video game on Reddit.
---
It is a social conversation. Your social skills are very poor if you think it's socially acceptable to go around stating that your guesses at things are fact. Most people dislike that.
---
Again, you've dodged the idea that your data is meaningless. You can't admit you are literally guesing.
---
It's totally fine to guess, man. We do it all the time, just be honest with yourself and call it what it is, a guess.
---
&gt;We now know thanks to the 4chan leaks
---
Cmon bruh.
---
Just watch any vanilla pvp vids
---
switch is 3-4-5x slower than high end cellphones everywhere it counts when it comes to wow.
---
Shaman T3 and Warlock PvP sets were sick.
---
It stopped being able to proc itself in patch 1.4. The Windfury internal cooldown was 81.67% of the Vanilla experience for American players and 91.54% of the experience for European players.
---
No, it was at least 10K IQ. Googling cheese fence manipulation strats is 5 IQ at best.
---
Probably .3 an hour. Etsy takes an absurd margin
---
I'll have you know I have a great relationship with your mom.
---
Damn you must be extremely educated in this.
---
Maybe Blizzard should've hired you to reintegrate battle.net and warden into a 13 year old client. I guess it'd keep you busy for the next decade while the other people in the team add the other missing functionality that is being added to classic that no one is complaining about.
---
I think it's safer to trust Blizzards judgement on what was the right thing to do vs. some guy conspiracy theorist on Reddit who knows nothing in the matter.
---
Nope. I'm one of the easiest tanks to heal for according to my healers, because I'm good at keeping incoming damage smooth.  I pot, kite, put on a shield, etc when incoming damage is too high,  never pull when they're out of mana, always keep mobs off of them, etc.  Tanking with a 2h when appropriate gives you a lots of rage for aggro and generally results in the tank being another high DPSer.  All of  which greatly reduces the amount of time required to plow through content.
---
Lol the spawn times are insanely ramped up on private servers in the starting areas. They got so much shit wrong, it's not even funny.
---
Accurate lol
---
Balance is actually a lot stronger than the other meme specs besides feral. It doesn’t have as bad of mana issues as ele or shadow priests, and it certainly hits a lot harder than Ret pallys and enhancement shaman. 
---
Ele gets fucked in AQ with nature resistant mobs, but has enough mana to be okay in fights in MC and BWL for the most part. 
---
Balance uses Star fire so there’s no immunities. 
---
That said I’m not recommending balance unless that’s what you’re into.
---
I think it would be fun.  They should also do things like un-normalizing the weapon speed/damage.  It was fun to use a slow weapon and do a shitload of damage.
---
How many of these have you done before BFD?
---
apart from Judgement set, the art direction too wrong turn
---
old sets had down to earth classic fantasy look, while the later sets started to look clownish and laughably unrealistic
---
I am looking forward to those people getting banned.
---
For someone that keeps calling this discussion casual, you sure are getting upset over it.
---
&gt; Most people dislike that.
---
I have never once given a fuck if people like what I have to say.
---
&gt; Again, you've dodged the idea that your data is meaningless.
---
The data is not meaningless, but this conversation is. Have a great WoW Classic experience kid, I won't be seeing any more of your comments.
---
Yes, absolutely. Enhance is great fun, but lacks major sustained damage.
---
Shaman have a high skill cap in the sense that they must use the correct totems in the right situation. Tremor totem is a great example. Also, they should 'totem weave," which is basically gaining multiple bluffs without having the totem out.
---
Correct. And its more complex than 95% of other rotations you see in PvE.
---
Could’ve fooled me that you don’t like world pvp, you’d fit right in :)
---
I dont mind wPvp. But what I hate is people 8+ levels above someone just farming lowbies. The bigger the gap the worse it is. 
---
Having to fight people, you can actually fight back against is fun and awesome, but so many people feel like its part of the experience to farm lowbies. 
---
That is the worst part of a pvp server
---
Wish I had known about this! I’d have bought one or two
---

If you feed cloth to your tailoring, your First aid skill will be stuck at linen forever.
---
If you don't grind some cloth, or buy it from the auction house, your tailoring skill will only provide you with items about 10 levels below your level.  If you are the first tailor or the last tailor making bags you can make some money, however in the middle, you'd make more money selling your cloth to the other tailors using bags to skill up on.
---
There are some BoP recipes, and of course the moon cloth cool down that make tailoring worth it at certain points in your career however normally you'd be better off just buying your bags.
---
Oh haha, I didn't expect you to be one of those Xbox live kiddos.
---
You’re so patient x
---
Sorry to have upset you. Hope you have a better day. Not caring what others think isn't 'manly or stoic', it's a good trait to have buddy. Good luck out there.
---
You have to buy them in lots of 5

Haven’t you ever seen Unbreakable?
---
It is possible on shorter fights lightning bolt is a really good damage spell when it comes to the damage part and the talents for elemental are insane. To bad shamans need to down rank to survive past 4 min
---
The 90 minute nap is good for memory and creativity, but it has no extra benefits in reducing fatigue or increasing alertness over the 20 minute power nap.

Shammy also wouldn’t be in a group with casters and melee unless the grouping is suboptimal
---
No, its been updated to use the BfA one.
---
People who say Melee Leeway don't have proof because there was none. They have to reinforce their arguments with ad hominem attacks. You can see it all in my post a month ago
---
Has anyone successfully played Classic on a Chrombook? There are guides available and I've attempted but it's a pain to get it done.  The maker of the guide claims it is possible...just wondering if anyone actually has. TYI.
---
Ill take both please and thank you.
---
They weren't there from the beginning. Naxx was part of vanilla as well, but it's not going to be around from day one.
---
But hey whatever dissonance you need, use.
---
What page is this on? The WoW Diary ends when WoW launches and doesn't really cover anything post-launch, I thought.
---
Nvidia shield?
---
While your comment isn't inaccurate " Spam rank one ". There is only one rank to learn. Wing Clip doesn't have multiple ranks. Just an FYI.
---
God damnit I'm on a job site right now (construction) and that looks so fucking good
---
There's a shocking amount of retards defending massive queues.
---
It would have been 10 pm for the US east coast, so not really middle of the night
---
nope! Though you might be able to make a fall through version of the macro for Wing Clip:  
---
/cast Wing Clip  
---
/cast Wing Clip(Rank 2)  
---
/cast Wing Clip(Rank 1)  
---
This would cast lower ranks if you don't have the mana for the highest rank. I need to test this before adding it to the list though!
---
You do indeed have to run all the way back through the instance to reset Blackfathom Deeps. There's no quick and easy way to get to the front of the instance.
---
Addons got you fam.
---
Lol @ this post.
---
Same reason people use cheats in Counter Strike. They want to feel good without putting in the effort to be good.
---
Thanks so much!
---
Easy really, let me explain using Fireball 
---
Fireball rank 11 costs 395 mana so on a critical it refunds you 39 mana with master of elements. 
---
The arcane talent Clear Casting gives you spells a 10% chance to reduce the mana cost of your next spell by a 100%. If you then cast a fireball which hits a critical you will then be refunded 39 mana despite the fireball costing you no mana to cast. 
---
On the opposite end, you have arcane power talent, that increase all spells damage by 30% and the cost of 30% extra mana. So using rank 11 fireball under the effect arcane power will cost you 513 mana but it will still only refund you 39 mana if it criticals.
---
I do agree with everything you said, but I'm also not blind to the sheer inconvenience of it at times. I suppose it comes down to rl-friend bonds vs immersion. Personally, I'd blag the shit out of my friends until they had committed to a pvp realm... if you keep feeding them some motivational carrots, they'll become too invested to reroll... and voila, best of both worlds :D
---
They only shard during high stress times and only with other RP realms. By default sharding is disabled on RP realms.
---
For this argument to make ANY sense, there would have to be an iota of a semblance of balance in vanilla wow.  There is none.
---
As a Horde player, I didn't roll a pally until TBC, but I was able to tank all 5 man content, Kara (although there are some weird fights), and Gruul.  We didn't really attempt more than Gruul while I was active.  That said, I have no idea how much was changed for TBC.
---
Aha, that's the kicker then, thanks for correcting there.  Makes sense to use it sparingly/situational then until Holy Shield at lvl 40.
---
For the first macro, you need to have Super Macro installed for the function buffed(). Sorry I didn't mention before.
---
Nothing immerses me more than being relentlessly camped by a rogue named Xxdonkeypunchxx

T3 is nice if you hide the helm and wear Argent Dawn tabard.

T1 is Banandin forever.

I love talking about this if we can do it with the understanding that not all styles are for all players.
---
So: To me, ganking is fun, and *being ganked is fun.* People act like there is nothing you can do, but they are wrong. If a level 60 is killing you, there is (almost) nothing you can do *at that moment,* but often times there is stuff you could have been doing to make yourself less likely to be ganked.
---
Did you keep your head on a swivel, staying aware of enemies in the area? Did you monitor chat to see reports of ganks happening nearby? Did you adjust your playstyle to pull less aggressively, to make yourself a less juicy target? Are you avoiding roadways and other frequently trafficked areas? 
---
Having to track all of these things makes leveling more dynamic and fun for me, even when no actual pvp is taking place. Of course sometimes you do everything right and get killed anyways, that can happen. The risk of it keeps me on my toes and makes every moment exciting. The biggest complaint I hear about it tho is getting spawncamped and farmed for hours on end. But honestly in all my years playing I can count the number of times this has happened to me on one hand. If you play smart, make yourself small,  use the terrain, *bring invisibility potions,* and do everything you need, it just doesn't happen enough to make a negative mark on my experience.
---
That "someone" is probably Blizzard themselves.
---
Spell batching is predictable, repeatable and intuitive. Using it in your playstyle isn't difficult, but it separates those who PvP by reacting to the other player, from those who predict what their opponent will do. 
---
It isn't random at all, and it does indeed show varying degrees of skill.
---
I need this in my life! You can get this on the Blizzard website?
---
No shame whatsoever to you carebears.
---
So as the sm/ruin lock, corruption is always my first global. It gives me a chance to shadow trance for an instant cast shadow bolt. Designated curse is second global. Although it should be first for ds/ruin locks.
---
because cloth paladins are a disgrace 
---
\*spits on the ground\*
---
What about melee hunters with a shaman ;P the best efficiency :P
---
Ok but that's still auto looting.
---
If you really wanted to you could make a macro to auto loot instead.
---
This.
---
If you want to tryhard then pick up engineering but if you want to raid casually then pick up whatever profession you want.  Both options work depending on what you want from your wow experience.  You might not go through naxx but that should be okay.  Azeroth is a very big world with plenty of content for everyone and there are plenty of raids that you can do without min maxing.  You don't need to choose specific professions or have a level 20 warlock alt or a clicker alt or any of that but you can if you want.

Honestly i have no idea. Maybe close to 80-100 days
---
There really was no reason to use 1h and shield in pre 60 dungeons. You could easily do them with 2h. You had more rage and more aggro and the dungeons really aren't that hard.
---
/r/firstworldofwarcraftanarchists
---
The game is 15 years old.  You either play it because you are an absolute minmaxingtryhard, or you play it because you want to enjoy some other aspect of it.  Ask yourself if you are a minmaxingtryhard, or are you a Night Elf Rogue?
---
Back then nobody knew better too.
---
Wow what a dick.
---
That's why you just make him heal.
---
I'm going to go ahead and say Warlocks over most other classes. They specialize in CC and 1vX with tons of curses
---
Phase 1 will most likely last more than 12 weeks.
---
Capital cities aren’t contested...
---
Lets be honest they need all the help they can get, even coming to the right faction.
---
Like I said, it takes longer because if those things. I'm distinguishing from *difficulty*. And you're definitely right it's harder to farm, because an opposite faction group comes along, and you're solo farming..then you're toast. So it takes you longer, on average to farm, X amount of gold, but none of the content is harder.
---
It just can't sustain damage. It comes from a mixture of kit and mana but if mana was not an issue ele would be much more viable. But every class kinda falls under that assumption.
---
True enough, I guess. (Although 10pm for me is already in the middle of the night but maybe that just makes me old)
---
You don’t need 13$ to do that
---
Ill have two accounts. Playing on pvp server so i can help my alts level, or transfer stuff between auction houses etc. Dont plan on playing both at the same time much. Only to help out or run through elite quests or dungeons
---
Locks scale extremely well with gear. So after getting aq40/naxx gear locks are near the top of the food chain. Prior to that they are mostly brought for utility/dps rather than pure dps.
---
Ok ill try to unpack each meme specs flaw and not have a wall of text.
---
Boomkin - they need a giant mana pool to sustain during a fight. So you are giving up on high spell damage gear for more int. Starfire damage is low compared to say fireball. And its a longer base cast time. There is also a fatal flaw in the talent nature's grace. Requiring 2 consecutive crits to actually benifit. (You can circumvent this with a macro and get a .2s cast speed decrease off of just 1 crit)
---
Elemental - honestly the strongest meme spec when geared properly but they struggle with resists and same flaw as boomkin where they need to give up spell damage for bigger mana pool. They however have an insane toolkit in the form of snapshotting clearcast procs.
---
Spriest - mindflay has low base damage, swpain takes up a debuff slot, mind blast is too fast of a cast and has a garbage spell coefficient. Spamming max rank mind blast on CD would require just like all other specs, to sacrifice spell damage for higher mana pool.
---
Prot paladin, the problem is no taunt, And where their threat comes from. Most of a prot pallies threat is thunderfury, and reflect damage. They need to many different stats. Spell damage, mitigation, intellect. Alot of this gear has low stamina.. There isnt enough itemized gear to help them succeed.
---
G D that would be a dream come true... I'm still trying to convince some buds to do exactly that (Trolls named Michelangelo, Leonardo, Donatello, Raphiel)
---
Maybe at first, but once you start refining your core group and finding players to replace the ones who dropped out and they stick around, you'll start dumping bad specs to make room for good players on useful specs.  Even in a casual guild this is bound to happen unless the raid group completely dies and disbands.
---
its really not that bad, I mean they have high natural agility, its just not quite as good as say human with those weapon skills
---
Content from previous expansions is exclusive to your realm or (low pop) cluster. You can still shard to other realms or bring players to your realm via grouping. BFA zones aren’t exclusive, but they still try to place you with others from your realm.

I spent most my time in casual-raiding guilds, but managed to clear most of AQ40 in classic, cleared MH and most of BT before i quit.

The disc priest is so elusive in vanilla. My prot pal welcomes any and all balance druids/disc priests/ fire locks/and Jack of all trades spec pallies. My dream was to see a disc priest in my runs that had the strongest bubbles and offheals while simultaneously dpsing.
---
Said no one ever
---
spriest was stronger than vanilla, still weak, but way more useful due to the mana regen (generally referred to as mana battery spec).
---
Still, spriest was never really amazing again until legion, but then in BFA it sucked again.
---
This is pretty good reasoning, and looking at hit tables, this makes the most sense. Thanks I guess I won't be greedy :p
---
They’ve actually stated that you will be able to do so.
---
i see...so it’s a cut and dry ratio? 334 people opens up one slot, and no one else can fit into the top bracket unless there is at least one additional full group of 334? so 660 active players, for example, wouldn’t be enough - you’d still need 8 more for 2 people to be allowed into the top category?
---
Trolling in videos is a great way to get downvotes.
---
Yeah! There tend to be only a few RP servers compared to regular PvE ones so they usually feel full. If you’re looking for reasonably friendly folks rp is the way to go (even if you don’t rp), IMO!
---
Not really since we have no visibility to batches on our end.  Can you try to maybe get lucky?  Sort of, is it repeatable not at all, you can have two people cast the same spells at each other with the exact same timings and get different results.
---
I mainly play as resto.  I haven't decided what mine will be this time around, but it's probably going to be resto.  When TStorm was a thing, I did that, because it was just so damn fun.  Enhance was fun when you could get big old WF crits with a 2H.
---
As resto I usually hung out throwing purges, frost shocks, and heals.  You stay busy as a harassment / support tool, and it was a lot of fun.
---
[let me in...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5nV9aKthU)
---
Yes, Naxx was part of Vanilla.
---
You're fucking insane dude. Just because something "Wasn't there from the beginning" doesn't mean it wasn't part of vanilla. You're delusional if you actually think this way. I honestly do not believe you're being serious right now. There's just no way.
---
Yes. This is all a conspiracy. people are in the pocket of "big leather", and trying to prop up prices and drive profits for themselves. I am actually an accomplice of stadics.
---
 In spite of this being a text post on reddit, It was really important to us that it gained traction, so we conspired to support this theory. As representatives of "big leather".
---
&gt;Layers are not meant to alleviate the beginner rush.
---
That is literally the problem that Blizzard has stated for the reason why they wanted to do sharding/layering. Tourist attrition is essentially the same thing, because everything we have heard indicates Blizzard anticipates the tourists will mostly go away prior to level 10.
---
One thing that we haven't heard is how many servers they plan to make available for launch, and that will help to determine how heavily they will use layering in that time.
---
It's not as if they will need 10 layers on Launch day, and those 10 layers will remain until the online server population returns to 3000 people.
---
People will find a way to cheese whatever system there is not fun. But layering is the least-worst option. Sharding is un-fun, as we saw from the Blizzcon demo.
---
I always thought the coolest look was human male paladin with this gear and sulfuras.
---
&gt; World PvP feels more special to me on a PvE server.

Yeah no shit because it hardly exists

---
P.S or be that warlock with Tailoring and Engineering for the PvP paybacks and obv for selfSS then mindblowing em all with them Jumper Cables XL  :D
---
Warrior please?!? Anyways cool stuff
---
Dude I was apart of this guild! I was Fable the gnome mage. I was originally on a druid on emerald dream then switched to mage when we all rerolled. I vaguely remember all the officers kohler, Pinto, fela.. etc. it’s been awhile but it was fun times I’ll never forget.
---
You are reading too much into it. The people who are trashing on nightelf rogues are the ones that are only trying to min/max their characters. Being a Human rogue using swords will net you just a slight bit more damage then a night self rogue using any weapon.
---
However, the skill of the player also comes into the play which a lot of these try hards forget. I played a night elf rogue during Vanilla, and I raided up till Naxx (guild was too lazy to attune). Out of allll the rogues in our raid I was top 3, beating many sword human rogues. Now of course we got smashed by mages and warlocks but lets not think about that right now.
---
If you do not plan to go ham on end game raiding then go ahead and play whatever you want. I for one am not raiding like that again and im going kitty dps (one of the worst classes to play) just because I want to.
---
In wrath. That was also when most buffs were made raid wide instead of party.
---
We would rotate shamans in and out of big boy melee groups. They were crazy good healers with chain heal too.
---
Damn, you're double fucked for getting a server type you want RP-PvP Non-English EU server is a fantasy at this pont.
---
i had to drink this 50 million times
---
wait what all t3 sets are fucking incredible imo
---
It’s not that bad for a rogue. Weapon skills matter however rogues get 5 from talents warriors don’t. So the racials make a bigger difference for warriors.
---
So as a rogue you only need 3 weapon skill outside of your talents to hit the 308 soft cap. Not a big deal. Even without the 3 weapon skill your dps won’t be far enough behind a human to make a difference, unless you’re in one of those guilds. Which if you are you wouldn’t be asking this question anyways.
---
Everyone needs to stop telling warriors that they dont have to worry about anything. They're overpopulated as a class as it is, let them figure it out or reroll.
---
I dont know bout that
---
they are called OOMkin for a reason
---
The great Meme off!
---
It's a video game, other than making human connections with others nothing is meaningful nor an achievement. 
---
What do you find hard about spending 12 hours corpse running? Or do you find hard clicking your abilities on enemies in "wpvp" ?
---
So they stack to 5? RIP bag room
---
No source because it's not timed based.
---
If the server see's that two people are within melee range, and a person _starts_ their swing, then the attack will go through no matter where the person is.
---
Example:
---
David the warrior is 5y away from Bob the rogue.
---
David starts his swing animation.
---
By the time the actual damage part of the swing is delivered, Bob the rogue has now moved to 10y away.
---
The swing still completes and the damage goes through.
---
It has nothing to do with "leeway" it's just that the damage is delivered no matter what if the swing animation started when they were within 5y melee range.
---
The issue always becomes this: nobody will pay what it’s worth. Most crocheted king sized afghans or quilts take upwards of or well over a hundred hours to make and people wanna offer you $20 for ‘em. It’s really sad and discouraging to be a creative. 🙁
---
THIS. Daggers better in PvP if respec too. Plus if you REALLY wanna min/max, at least you got highest base agility. Counts for "something"
---
Hi there, I'm sifting through all of the nice things people sent over and weighing my options and schedule. Thank you very much!
---
yup. DO you also tuck your teeshirts into your jeans?
---
Not even a fraction as good. Starting agility is minimal in difference at max level (like 10 ap and maybe .3% crit). Weapon skills are actually a substantial difference. Like 2% hit (kinda 3) and 20% increased damage on 40% of your white attacks.
---
That’s not Mountain Dew
---
Just play what you want. These minmaxers can do their stuff. But remember some of these tryhards will still be shit at the game. While some night elf rogue will be insane at the game. Race isn't everything.
---
Remember all those posts from a little over a week ago of people panicking that hunter pets were broken on beta and never going to get fixed? Remember how they fixed them? Have a little patience and keep reporting bugs.
---
Personally I think it's gonna be more "when retail players meet original players" with an analogous image of kids going to their parent's 15 year high school reunion. :)
---
All but one paladin missed out on the Reck Bomb fun, should we add that back too?
---
Wow. Great video proof there.
---
Try playing a game where there are real consequences for dying like losing all your gear, losing xp, or even having your character deleted.
---
&gt;  sort of pre-Gold state where a limited number of people help you!
---
wow! what kind of crazy out of the box thinking is that?!  somebody promote this man!
---
They only removed sharding for capital cities and later reneged on that arrangement anyway. Cross realm isn’t good for the RP community either since guilds can’t be shared, addons don’t work cross realm, and you don’t see the same people around day to day
---
I was thinking about this since they announced classic. I got into rp late when eso was launched. I always wanted to try it in wow, especially in classic. I will roll on rp-pve realm, but I also hope to raid.
---
&gt; Seems harder to find.
---
Your having a hard time finding a guild on servers not announced for a game that hasnt released? Thats so fucking weird, me too!
---
downvoted because this is the oldest and most retarded trick to get people to upvote something.
---
It's not that important. But for pve sword human is better and for pvp going dwarf/gnome is better. There's really no benefit to going NE except you do a bit more dagger dps than dwarf/gnome but swords is generally better so human sword rogue wins.
---
Nah, the collective whole of reddit would just complain more than usual.
---
It seems I have a different interpretation of “funny”.
---
You'd be surprised. In a previous job I was in charge on prepping graphics like this and we were rarely told what to use and would often sneak in little easter eggs like this.  If I saw Classic ads throughout BB's website, I'd tend to agree with you. But I only saw this twice and both times was the same graphic just at different sizes.
---
Pretty incredible the amount of coordination and stamina these people are gonna have to get this all done in a week. I hope someone records it in some fashion.
---
Feign Deathing
---
I don't know. But you don't need /follow to multi-box, you're relying on sync-ed movement inputs.
---
if you spend 2 hours trying to finish one starter quests then the problem lies with you.
---
Well yeah I'd probably never go non human on a serious character but on an alt I might go gnome.  (Stabbing folks in the ankles and all lol)
---
Damn you’re 2-0 on these cartoon WoW crossovers.  They were both so good, can’t wait to see what you come up with next.
---
Damn, strong argument there.
---
Perplexity who made a video on it plays a rogue, it doesnt benefit him to point it out. In fact if its left as is it's a huge plus for melee classes to be able to run through blizzard without getting hit. I don't know how it was in actual classic to compare though, but with melee leeway and blizzard "bug" melee will have a significant advantage over mages, thought it could very well be the same advantage they always had..
---
&gt; Just because something "Wasn't there from the beginning" doesn't mean it wasn't part of vanilla. You're delusional if you actually think this way.
---
That's not the argument though. 
---
The argument is that having the class changes from the beginning is a change from vanilla. Delaying naxx isn't a change from vanilla, having it day 1 would be.
---
I'm not sure there's an easier way to explain this, especially through dissonance that thick. 
---
But hey, I'm ready to see more strawmen.
---
Machine wash?
---
Well, he's not drinking it yet.
---
Okay I think it’s fair to say strangelthorn is more of an exception, for obvious reasons.
---
Oh go fuck yourself with the sharpest object you can find. 
---
Overleveled players killing lowbies is horrible for pvp. And there are no arguments that change it. Basically telling people to be a rabbit until they can go gank someone is the worst fucking advice.
---
This is based on memory but everlook wasn't bad but tanaris was the go make a sandwich flight path.
---
it's just not the same
---
I think we're talking semantics. It takes longer to hit your goals. I don't consider that *harder*, but I understand that you do. I see value in the distinction between the two.
---
I've played both pve and pvp servers and nothing was harder, so there's nothing "easier" that I want.
---
Bit these days i have a busy life and I want to accomplish my goals faster because if that,  so yes, I don't want to be slowed down being ganked while leveling. And I don't want raids ruined, or time taken from doing them, due to pvp issues.
---
If pvp threats were a constant problem, both on grinding resources to raid..and to he actual raiding schedule, then I probably wouldn't get to experience all the raid content,  which is my #1 goal.
---
Other people have their #1 goal, and no one is wrong, just different.
---
You'd love my keyboard
---
Warriors are like the worst 1v1 class in the game lol.
---
&gt; This is the toxicity you promote
---
You.
---
&gt; Oh go fuck yourself with the sharpest object you can find.
---
Also you. 
---
Do you just wake up in the morning and decide to be an asshole, or is it something that happens automatically?
---
no changes. so when Leroy happens, there better be the exact same number of dead whelps
---
nice ,you probably have a heart of gold that benefits so many people in your life :)
---
yea man. felt badass for sure https://imgur.com/ZG1OKKy
---
Go elemental instead.
---
Rum (straight) and coke
---
yes, its a very stupid idea to roll a night elf rogue.
---
humans get +5 swords which is a big dps boost for pve.  the increase in rep gain is also a huge time savor
---
dwarves at least get stoneskin which can have some uses
---
night elves do flips when they jump
---
yeah, i had to hit up my guild to schedule a SM run. its been pretty dire on beta PVE server
---
I remember meeting a group of tauren on PvE in arathi questing together. We emote-trashtalked and dueled eachother for a few hours. I was a bitch gnome warlock, and had tons of fun. Theres deffs diferrent unique experiences.
---
why is your monitor so skinny.
---
me too, but then I clicked the link and smirked... thought it was another "hate streamers" post... guess it was, sort of. good music too.

hurr durr if u dont play optimal race/class combo u'll be worthless

i kinda liked old wrath, sleek and badass
---
POW-WEE
---
I'd gladly take that for a few days if it means no layering.
---
its not "trying hard" to pick a race that has beneficial racials.  you simply click on human instead of night elf
---
if you listen to this murko-o-matic guy you will be a terrible player...
---
This is wrong SO wrong omg. Paladins got major changes in tbc which were critical in enabling them to tank...
---
Willpost more from home cuz its pain to tpye from phone but just check the block increase. In vanille u needed to be crit to get enhanced block but 1 crit sends you into the grave. Theese things are super big in making it viable.
---
because its really "Try hard" to click on human instead of night elf when making a character
---
I think by the time I quit in early TBC i had something absurd like 160 days played on my main (most of which was afk in main cities not logging out, or just blatantly afk) and another 40 on my 29 rogue twink.
---
So close to around 200 days played, which is more accurately 200 days total time spend logged in and mostly afk.
---
better off rolling dwarf or gnome than NE
---
I don't remember if there was any leeway in vanilla, but I do remember having to almost pass people to hit them while chasing. Listening to the "too far away" spam while standing right on top of your target was something a lot of melee players dealth with.
---
Though things were a lot laggier then.
---
Well, I went out of my way to collect the video, should I just remake a new thread and explain it with the time stamps
---
SOMEone didn't read the description... LOL - &lt;3 the haters that hate for no reason... they make everyone else look good.
---
They followed up with another post saying UBRS will not count as a raid for the sack of loot sharing. Meaning Loot in UBRS is final.
---
World bosses should 100% count as a raid I hope
---
Also I'm curious why Smoldering Wand (13.4 DPS) is listed on there after Lesser Magic Wand (17.5 DPS) I know it's higher level but thats a pretty decent damage loss, it's the only one that seems to be a down grade.
---
ya found one, im gonna make a new thread so the title would appropriately explain it
---
&gt; It takes longer to hit your goals. I don't consider that harder, but I understand that you do. I see value in the distinction between the two.
---
It kinda just comes off as you waving away the increased difficulty to feel better about your choice.
---
But hey, whatever helps! I would say that something taking longer, and not only having more obstacles but obstacles that explicitly DO NOT EXIST on pve servers, would increase the difficulty.
---
Playing against other players is objectively more difficult than playing against NPCs. It's not even really a question.
---
one race has +5 swords/maces and increased rep gained
---
the other does flips...
---
40 boxing won't be too good in classic.
---
Can't make macros that automatically heal and dispel like it was possible in vanilla. (will be a lot harder to multibox raids)
---
Can't use follow in bgs.
---
So for the most part multiboxing will only be for dungeons and world pvp.
---
I'm curious to see if that will continue in classic - there already have been a good amount of differences between the beta and what we've seen on private servers. I'm all for the change and will roll with whatever, but I don't think we can take private server experiences as gospel without seeing the raid tuning.
---
People have averaged 4-5 hours of television per day for decades, but somehow a video game (that requires more thinking and socialization than tv) makes someone unbalanced? Interesting  opinion.
---
...what
---
All this stuff had been tested on live servers back in vanilla.
---
More like druids who hit 40 and instantly get the benefit of full plate without having to farm for it
---
BC was my favorite time to raid lead.  I was a BM Hunter so obviously I stacked my group with 3 BM's, a feral, and a shaman, and would rotate at least two, if not sometimes a third shaman in for bloodlust chaining.
---
People are taking issues with you mentioning greys, not greens.
---
This is why we can’t have nice things.
---
But the people there may have come from a zone that was contested, and remain flagged for 5 minutes. Even if not everyone there is flagged, there will still be plenty who are.
---
BFD is my 5th, so there are 4 others. Ragefire, Deadmines, Wailing Caverns, and Shadowfang Keep
---
This is how I treat gankers. You are sub human trash. And tell anyone else that it is okay and that they should do it make you worse
---
I'm about to need roll this
---
Yup, this has been my experience as well.  I think people exaggerate.
---
The video description has nothing to do with stealing someone's copyright.
---
You simply don’t understand what he is saying.
---
You can't have an Alliance and a Horde toon on the same server in classic. On the same account anyway.
---
The OP was specifically asking about basic mechanics not the intricacies of perfecting a specific class.
---
And despite what some people like to believe the basic mechanics are the same.  Movement, key binds, quests, looting, action bars, macros, combat etc... are the exact details different?  Maybe but that wasn't the question asked.

Is their a salt variety?
---
For some it's about ***A E S T H E T I C S***
---
Very well done ty! I was hoping for something specific for healers but I guess trinkets are pretty limited :p
---
AQ gear. ❤️  Clearly I have an uncontrolled fetish...
---
I tanked using a 2 hander and Imp Righteous  Fury from 22- 40 on the beta. We never whiped a single time
---
Enhance was already sketchy prior to the patch 1.11 and 1.4 nerfs to WF, with everything in a 1.12 state I would actually consider it to be one of the very few *dead specs*.
---
Resto can heal very well, in both pvp and pve, and ele is just straight up better.
---
Personal best for most flips in a row.
---
I think everyone will sort of min-max most of their characters and I'm guessing WOW vanilla will be a lot more hardcore than the original retail release was.
---
The simple reason being, only the enthusiastic will return, and if your enthusiastic about WoW, it's very likely you actually invested a lot in the game .
---
Sure, this doesn't apply to the complete 100% of the population however I feel its such a majority that it will influence the game.
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
I think if you're not level 60 within 10 days of release you should just give up tbh. I can't imagine why you'd want to do it slower than that. Would be such a horrible thing.
---
The leeway ordeal is really strange. A tauren warrior can hit you from miles away. Is that honestly how it was? We can't completely depend on old video footage because internet speeds varied a lot.
---
Have they mentioned internal layering cooldown, or anything about layering? I saw that some testers mention that they believe a cooldown was added. Seems they are trying to patch the exploits so the general public won't exploit it, or just make it harder to exploit. But if it is exploitable it will be abused.
---
"I pride myself in talking out of ignorance and badmouthing and misrepresenting something I haven't experienced myself."
---
If you have a decent printer, you can print on clear sticker paper and apply it!
---
More along the lines that the person I replied to seems to think that they're hardcore for playing on PvP servers. I played WoW on PvE, but have played other games that are much more hardcore than playing WoW on PvP.
---
If they can't prove it then they shouldn't be saying it was a vanilla mechanic with absolutely nothing to back it up.   
---
I remember we had a hunter drop all his DKP on Asscandy. He was running around BGs raptor striking folks heads off. Through people off being slowed and having ground closed by a hunter. “Like bro shouldn’t you be kiting me?... OMG Raptor Strikes of DOOOOM!”
---
sub ran out 6/1, still playing beta
---
stop making stuff up
---
10 = 2.5 hours
---
20 = 11.5 hours
---
40 = 2.5 days
---
60 = 5.5 days 
---
These aren't just fast times, they are planned, coordinated, and diligent times. Most players, even going fast, will come in around 8 days played.
---
The people doing sub-5 days played are professionals. I know because I've strived to be one through multiple server launches. My fastest time is 6 days played at 60, but I always level professions along the way because that's equally important to me. 
---
If you are planning on sub-6 days: its 70% preparation and 30% execution. That means days (meaning 50 or 60 hours) spent preparing.
---
What happens if I stand up while drinking? Does the bottle shatter?
---
https://imgur.com/a/lj6Ecyr
---
Want. How get?
---
If that's the case why don't they say its in the code from the reference client like they do to all the other bugs that get mentioned?
---
&gt;but there is almost nothing more frustrating than a tank that stands at the back of the group, is scared to pull, or that waits 2-3 minutes between pulls. 
---
As a cautious tank myself there's nothing worse than impatient DPS pulling mobs and/or not allowing me to get aggro thus wiping the group forcing us to all do corpse runs.
---
I think the general lack of moderation attracts anti-social behavior, regardless of the platform, be it game, forum, social media, etc.
---
I hope Blizzard is prepared to take control right from the start and not allow any of this shit fly.
---
I did play first two stress tests(not third cuz Eu) and had no issues with how it was. I think the difference is that unlike you I expect there to be people playing on launch, that’s kind of what the first two letters of MMORPG stand for.
---
How sad is your life that you need to gank people who haven't got a snowballs chance in hell of touching you? Its like going into a daycare and beat children. And saying the ones that ran away faster had fun
---
(30/0/21) can heal perfectly fine in all raid content up to around late AQ (i.e. anything beyond twin emps).  If you hit level 40, I would recommend picking up elemental mastery as it allows you to delete people at will every 3 minutes and absolutely speeds up the leveling process. At 60, respec and get Natures swiftness if you want 30/0/21 instead of the more bursty 31/0/20.
---
Ele-resto is notorious for being able to nuke people into the ground and purge paladin buffs, while still being able to heal.  Probably one of the strongest group pvp or world pvp classes.
---
The math on a mana tide totem shows its not a huge benefit for yourself, as its works out the be the same as like 12 mp/5 for a boss encounter, and is more beneficial to drop in for the other casters in your group. If you are assigned to heal a melee group, then its not really worth it. Just bring mana potions and demonic runes and spam heals.
---
I would not recommend trying to raid dps as elemental.
---
please explain why its harder to click on human than night elf at the character creation screen?
---
Hell of a post. Thanks for compiling all this. &lt;3
---
It sounds like that tank was undergeared and you were overgeared in this instance. Pally tanks manage just fine in dungeons and can always just toss BoP on any caster that's going above and beyond.
---
Ohhhh the day these folks get out-dpsd by any of the non 'minmaxbullshit' combos, and then go cry on the forums. Can't wait.
---
Yeah I didn't know Altaholic did that until I looked at the "All Realms / All Accounts" page. **Bad** idea
---
What's the second column in the "frostbolt" part?
---
because it really does not impect the rest of the classes whatsoever, apart from an incredibly rare occurence.
---
i know what you are saying. hence why i corrected the stupid part of it.  there is nothing try hard about picking one race over another.  when you get to level 60 and start farming blasted land buffs then you can be considered try hard
---
i didnt disagree with the minmaxing aspect
---
My carpal tunnel says it’s different!
---
Eh, while leveling I doubt it makes much of a difference unless you're under geared or leveled.  I never was in a position where I felt I had to equip it during the beta.
---
Phase one is super limited- that being said if the priest class quest is in the game, that's a great way of getting a pretty big +healing trinket!
---
The only other "healing specific" trinket I know of is from BRD [Second Wind](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11819), but it's not much better than briarwood reed.
---
They see videos of people using it and think you can time it. They don't understand that those videos had hours of shit trimmed out of them where the batch didn't work in their favour.
---
Really just thrown together, but it's something.
---
Join the conversation in the Druid discord then. It is known.
---
Paladins got gear itemized for them in TBC beyond the 5 men istance level.
---
Like actual raid gear and sets made for tankadins.
---
i am ridiculing his argument. he claimed its being "try hard" to pick one race over the otehr
---
I played for a while on PvE servers with some real life friends.  I was flagged 24/7 and people I grouped with would grief me for it because buffing/healing them would flag them and they'd whine and cry.
---
I just play PvP now, because that's the world I want to live in.
---
Play PvE if that's your jam, don't let this sub influence you.  It ain't my jam, but I'm not gonna do much more than take some light hearted jabs at you for it, ya carebear.
---
Does ele have melee side too?
---
I'm wondering as well. I've seen the guides and videos you are referencing, but haven't set it up to confirm...
---
[It's paid off](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=41&amp;date=2017-10-01%202019-07-02&amp;q=wow%20classic#TIMESERIES). Consumer interest in WoW Classic since the Beta announcement has remained at or above consumer interest since their own announcement at Blizzcon in November 2017.
---
Also kind of interesting that there are 15 countries with more interest in wow classic than the US.
---
a bunch of RP idiots...
---
You’re a dip. 
---
Skinning doesn’t cause agro. Proximity causes agro.
---
Hunter, warlock, priest, warrior. Newbies on petclasses
---
Yes. Shamans running about with Hand of rag and rank 14 gear will destroy you regardless.
---
&gt;They're overpopulated as a class as it is
---
This will not be the case in classic.
---
They're overpopulated on private servers and on this subreddit because we all know how important they are.
---
This subreddit does not accurately reflect the population of players who will be playing classic. There will still be tank shortages at 60 in classic.
---
Thankfully Druids and Paladins can at least tank 5 mans.
---
No one is saying it is harder. They are saying that it is aiming for min-maxing rather than for enjoying the world and the immersion. Classic isn't a remotely hard game and aiming to min-max it is tryhard for the game being 15 years old.
---
&gt;homophobic AND racist
---
What's not to like?
---
Sounds good fun! Any chance of escaping a fight if losing then? When in melee. Survivability.
---
Ill prio stam over everything on pvp servers tbh
---
Shadow priest is a top PvP player. 
---
In PvE, they do high burst (mind blast, SWP, mindflay, mind blast). They lack sustain because of mana issues. Guilds might take one spriest for damage...might. 
---
You can heal dungeons as shadow because you take the mana efficiency points in discipline. Molten core probably too, but you will need some holy priests for raid healing.
---
Spriests compete with mages, warlocks and holy paladins for gear. They do not use spirit as holy does. 
---
Fun class to play. Super easy to level despite what people say.
---
Welcome to reddit.
---
LUL
---
Imp bitch, you don't really need the 100 ap over the HP for survivability, especially when dual wielding.
---
Where I live I've never seen a game advertised outside of television commercials so I have no idea. I still remember one time driving up to San Francisco and seeing a Battlefield 3 add covering the side of a huge building and it was pretty cool since I'd never see any advertisements around here.
---
I got as far as downloading Linux but got lost downloading the WoW client. When I went back to try I couldn't get back into Linux so said F it. I'm not very coding/Linux adept.
---
yeah, all the good rogues are going to roll night elf...lol
---
i can see the guild memes now. "your dps is so low the night elf beat you"
---
Cool, I will give it a go. That sounds perfect for me. Like I said, never played it but thought I would this time around. Thanks a lot for that.
---
you get extra combo points if you can chain flips though..... not thoroughly tested on beta so take that with a grain of salt
---
I'd buy one!
---
Of course they don’t wanna give it a push. They don’t want to accept the facts - the magic of slow, meaningful gameplay within online, rpg, and adventure / treasure is what defined blizzard entertainment as a household name. 
---
and the Boost macrotransaction and cosmetic stuff store are not, they are not Blizzard. They are esports moba elements that do not belong in our RPG. 
---
Politically though, the decision managers were absolutely unable to prevent the passionate game makers that are still there doing the main work from proceeding onward with resurrecting classic. it was probably sold to the Decision Managers as just for historical obligation and might result in more sub revenue from users who won’t buy any transaction or sub otherwise. 
---
The Decision manager people will take 999,999 dps to its Pride HP as classic SURGES hard and the users increase sub numbers while both occupancy and transactions revenue falls falls falls in the level 120 wow token world.
---
I actually can agree with that. You'll miss out on parry but I doubt there's any mail gear past lv 40 with parry anyway so it's not that relevant.
---
Should have made a macro then ;)
---
For everyone who needs a tl;dr. 
---
Go to a daycare and beat children. The fast ones will enjoy getting to play hide and seek
---
Still, it's helping pure DPS classes, so in that regard it's only helping pure classes more if not neutralizing the pros of what hybrids are getting.    
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again: take some TBC talents and put them at the far end of the dps tree ( the ones that reward Mana), and make a nature resist debuff. This would solve a lot of problems in pve.
---
Ele and Oomkin also suffer from extremely high nature resist on raid bosses, and not benefitting from CoE.
---
No more no less than a regular Enh or Elem. What you can have is instant heals that will save you !  
---
It's adding RNG on top of your RNG, but hey, as shamans, I say why not :p
---
back to auto attacking its gets better after 40 :) not
---
This is me right now.  Pretty sure I decided to main a priest and alt a warrior that I'll only play with rested XP to alleviate some of the painful warrior grind.  That will give me the best of both worlds.
---
The dwarf warrior attack animations in WoW are some of the worst in the game. Gimli would be upset.
---
Started playing right after the game came out. I was in the Army and was playing with my wife and a bunch of friends back home. We were a very casual guild but worked together a lot. It was so much fun to run around with everyone, chat over TS and feel like we were accomplishing things together. Played solidly for about 4 years. Left when life got too busy. Went back for a couple expansions but I quit for good once they totally changed the talent trees. I am looking forward to playing classic. I've recruited a lot of those same friends to play again. It will be like old times again. When I read all of the crazy changes they made in future expansions, it really isn't even the same game. OG WoW for the win.
---
Critical strike and crushing blow are not the same things.
---
Leeway was for PvP only.
---
&gt;1.3 patch notes:
---
&gt;Spells in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect when targets are moving. This should improve the overall usability of spells and ranged attacks.
---
That's also not what trope means.
---
two type of plays
---
good and bad...
---
Private servers may be different, especially since I've heard the dodged/parties are too high, but I'm shifting out to heal every one or two pulls. So the benefit of getting that extra energy seems big. Might swap around to test it soon.
---
If either pally or shamans get a big buff, competitive players will flock to that faction to play that class. Faction balance is very important in classic, more than ever before.
---
Yes :D
---
I would say they are favored (to varying degrees) in literally every 1v1 matchup except against a very good druid maybe. They have no hard counters, which is rare in vanilla. They're well regarded as the best 1v1 spec.
---
Thanks, will watch later when able!
---
This is true, just easing them into it, dont want to scare them all away before release or there will be noone left to shit on. I have the testosterone on a drip, combined with my boomer juice I am unstoppable.
---
Mind vision is great but in terms of preventing FC from getting away SP have nothing but a single slow and a random stun.
---
A SP is much better at intercepting a FC doing lots of dmg and dispelling HoTs and shields etc.
---
Couldn't care less what they do.
---
Laughs in Chromaggus
---
PvE rotation: Frostball, Frostball, Frostball, Frostball, Frostball
---
I know private servers are a little different, but right now it seems pretty nice to have. If it screws me in the long run I could always switch to full feral at like lvl 30-40
---
I wouldn't call taking a tree just for one buff talent and sitting around in cloth healing *viable*, but that's just me.
---
Naxx/ZG/AQ is closer to horde hubs though, which somewhat balances it. I dont disagree about paladins.
---
It’s not under the radar.  I have at least a dozen buddies that don’t normally play this type of game that are all pumped for it.
---
It's better to go deep into the feral tree because it increase your dps and improve your kill time.  As a druid survivability isn't a problem, you can just run away from about anything easily. 
---
Furor is nice if you plan to pvp at low level or you absolutely hate to be ganked and you want max survivability.
---
Sweet..Mother...Of...God
---
I played alliance last time around so all this group changing for shamans is really interesting. 
---
Adds another trait to being a good raid leader/officer
---
&gt; I think it's more dangerous to be this stupid and poor both intellectually and emotionally. 
---
lmao, triggered by a "git gut" and a "care bear" comment and im poor emotionally, you need a doctor for your brain bro. Sorry to be the one to tell you. this aint normal.
---
Nah, I have a job, a girlfriend, and self respect.
---
shadow priest is a good 1v1 class.  they aren't a top pvper in group pvp (battlegrounds)
---
You equip both.  Wand is in your ranged slot.
---
Here is a questions just for fun.
---
How would you level as an ele shaman?
---
Oh fucks sake I forgot that too 🤣😅
---
Ion never said 2 months.
---
Thank you for the explanation, I was quite confused about this whole issue.
---
Going Horde, but not picky on class right now. 
---
Biggest thing is I want to be Wanted at raids/groups. What’s the rarest / most needed class usually for raids? Bonus if not many play that class for better gear chances.
---
Joana is expecting for the record to be beat
---
You still need to deal more than 50% of his life to get the kill, am I wrong? I don't remember how it worked
---
2 months minimum. Probably 4.
---
Is loot sharing actually confirmed for classic? How does it work specifically?
---
Yes. From the man himself.
---
That dumb turban is the only one I remember from before the change. I don't remember how far we got in MC pre-1.4, I was probably just too low on the totem pole (heh) to get Ten Storms pre-change.
---
I loved em. You had to compensate with the gear deficit by being sharp and playing smart. They rewarded playing well.
---
Lol this guy is the best at world of warcraft might as well cancel classic no one can get on this level
---
So you know who to yell at for pulling aggro
---
i leveled a mage gnome on stress test with insane amount of people being in the zone with me, it took me like 45 minutes to level to 5
---
i also leveled a lock to lvl 10 on a 2nd stress test in ~2 hours with insane amount of players on my layer
---
if it takes you 2 hours to finish one quests its definitely on you
---
Sad to say it's just a guess.
---
Technical stuff like this gets me all hot and bothered :))
---
i'm still hearing that song:
---
"Remain calm, is just alpha"
---
"Remain calm, is just beta"
---
"Remain calm, is just first weeks"
---
"Remain calm, is first patch"
---
Anyway ...  nice system!
---
I just need to control where i am, where my friends are, a timer for my layering,multiple timers for multiple friends layers, dungeons reseting timers, phases reseting timers, levels reseting timers, PVP reseting timers... it seems quite simple just to avoid a few days of caos! :D
---
&gt; Well except if you are one of those no sleep yes drugs people who will reach 60 in the first weak. I'd argue those people are playing easy mode because they will outlevel everyone.
---
I work 70 hours a day, im just NOT a care bear.
---
The gatekeeping is next level around Classic. You'll be fine as a nelf. 
---
I think you're silly when female dwarves are right there, personally. But you do you.
---
A trip to heaven. I really hope if they do Classic TBC they release with the un nerfed version of the heroics and tune them down in later phases
---
You can trade looted BoP items to other individuals within your raid within 1 hour (iirc) after looting it. Just like in retail.
---
Does not apply to dungeons though. Just raids.
---
There will be plenty of account sharing this time around don't worry.
---
Second week is almost guaranteed
---
If i dont get a chance at loot why would i bother doing a raid pve is fucking boring you take away the reward and theres no point
---
Not trying for any records. Just making sure I'm 60 by 4 weeks in playing 8-10hrs day. Some issues I seem to be running into are RNG for quest objective drops. Playing as UD putrid claws were taking forever to drop, bat hides as well, etc.
---
Not most - just the retail tourists who have flooded in here since the beta and won't make it past 20 anyway.
---
i like you...
---
this reddit page is infested with cry baby meme spec players
---
The dev says 'probably in a couple of months' clearly hinting that 3 or 4 months could be an option as well but you cite it as definite proof that DM will be available within 2 months... ok.
---
you are learning... good job
---
&gt; I'm most interested in actual vanilla stories, but private server experience is welcome. I expect Classic will more resemble the latter than former.
---
Classic culture has changed a ton since original vanilla. You're more than likely going to see private server pug behavior in classic.
---
Expect:
---
&gt; LFM UBRS ace/flask reserved
---
&gt; LFM MC legendaries/recipes reserved, accuria top 3
---
&gt; LFM BWL trinkets/head reserved
---
&gt; LFM ZG idols t2+, heart reserved
---
You're not using "boof" correctly...
---
After Classic is released I have no reason nor desire to return to retail ever again. The game I loved died long time ago, I just needed time to realize it. No matter what they try to do, you can't revive what is dead.
---
Bigger shoulders than taurens? I guess you mean proportionally the biggest?
---
I agree with you on many points, but I think the benefit of the faster healing wave outweighs the value of the 5% heal mana reduction.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but is healing wave not more efficient than lesser healing wave? If so, it seems the more fitting cast for single target healing. Given, chain heal is more used in raids, but I don't want to rule out healing single target.
---
Not every human sword rogue is a tryhard, but every tryhard sword rogue is a human
---
this is a no brainer.  humans are vastly superior to night elves due to the +5 hit
---
gnomes and dwarves are better for PvP
---
night elves do flips...
---
Anything can be boofed if you're brave enough. Including this title.
---
So in other words, some people will be struggling to tag mobs in their pop capped layer while if you're lucky enough to get into a new layer you'll have the place to yourself for awhile.
---
That's not their argument at all..
---
They're saying the *methodology* of picking a class is either from a minmaxingtryhard or a personal preference (in this case Nelf rogue).
---
Your comments imply otherwise, Kek
---
There has been enough uproar that they will mostly back down on the decision.
---
One of those teams should have been laid off. Maybe sent back to art school.
---
&gt;War mode is such a great idea, but it had one fatal flaw in that over time the "losing" faction loses motivation to participate, which leads to less support and more frustration for those that continues.
---
WoW PvP servers have the same flaw really. A slight population imbalance can quickly turn into a mess as one faction becomes the "PvP" faction on that server and new players join the winning side as others quit the losing side.
---
What day does your week start?
---
Technically this is possible, but in reality no raid leader is timing group swaps based on WF totem ticks
---
Nice! Do you know the name of the priest trinket?
---
That's the evilest thing
---
Makes sense. Honestly, I never considered UBRS a raid, even when it was 15 man. There was basically always a group with a key advertising on chat. I have no idea how there were so many keys floating around. I ran a lot of UBRS, but only a couple LBRS runs.
---
You got it backwards.  The people crying about "minmax" are butthurt.
---
I was bored at work so I commented on Reddit. Enjoy your night elf rogue and low dps
---
I think essentially it comes down to:
---
Preach 🙌🏼
---
Meal prep Sunday is where it’s at.
---
Prior to level 38, you don't. For elemental to be worth itnypu need both so gear and late tree talents for it to work. 
---
At 38 you have all the talents and cast time reduction to lb/cl you need. Plus a new rank of lightning bolt.
---
Elemental is actually the fastest method to level as a shaman by simply spamming lightning bolt at targets. Its your highest DPs spell and most mana efficient. You can drop targets in around 10 seconds or 5 spell casts, and if necessary 1 or 2 melee attacks or a down ranked lb to finish them off. Taking longer than that will significantly slow down your xp/h.
---
If he were a tryhard irl he'd be out getting laid and not on a classic wow subreddit pestering people because they want to play a race he doesn't approve of.
---
What if I told you there are more important things than DPS to some players?
---
This is going to be my mentality for my alts. 
---
I've made an agreement with my SO, they play a healer (priest) for our main's and I play their support for literally every other character (so I'll be a shaman and druid for our alts) which means I'll more than likely be healing for groups, which is fine, my question is though should I level as resto specs for Druid/shaman since my SO will be the dps?
---
I like more this one "the raid boss is still alive because the rogue is a NE".
---
Damn I'm 4 friends short
---
Yes, I know this, I'll pick up Herbalism at 40, focus on fishing instead of roaming around for herbs without a mount as a Priest.
---
well as already mentioned shaman needs healing way for his slow heal to be efficient and also as already mentioned this spec mostly uses chainheal since you don't need talents to make it worthwhile.
---
I'd really want to go down feral until I got feral fairy fire and heart of the wild, then switch to resto and get furor.
---
The only problem with this is latency and reaction time. I thought about doing this as well but I’m not sure it will work in practice. It’s a good idea though!
---
I play for non consensual pvp first and foremost, so I never had a choice.  But PvE servers are conveneient if you don’t care about the sandbox/harsh world aspect of it.
---
You're right.  I tend to forget that some of these guilds have been playing on pservers for over a decade now.  Also, with the release patch being 1.12, Rag will already be in his nerfed state which will make him MUCH easier to defeat than he was when the game first released.
---
No worries, I at least have some understanding of the whole issue now.
---
Hopefully, in time they can properly gauge how many servers are truly needed. I am sure there will still be some who play modern WoW, so they just need to figure out the balance.
---
Nah I'm not gonna play a Rogue or a NE for that matter. 
---
I'm just really amused by finding out how many more comment replies I can get out of you.
---
Somehow this will get downvoted. Good work though.
---
Keep a tissue handy to clean up all the tears. 
---
In all seriousness you will just OOM all the time.  Similar gameplay, but you lack the ENH talents to do more mana-free weapon damage.  It really doesn't become viable until you start to get a decent amount of mp/5 on gear or some +spell damage which is so close to 60 that it's tough to get a gear set together that actually makes it work.
---
My goals for classic is 1 of every alliance class to 60 (yes I know what that entails) and there no way I'm doing all of that while being ganked on pvp servers!
---
Downed in the first week, haha yea and grizzly adams had a beard.
---
And if you do boof it- it's free. So bust it out.
---
Well in another post he called a certain group of people "larp virgins".
---
I chuckled a bit since one of my lady friends is in to larp, and boy...is she amazing in the bedroom.
---
So on a over server. What happens if I walk into say ogrimar as an alliance member
---
I can’t wait
---
Not OP but I agree with you, in PVP situations the half second on healing wave can make or break the situation.  5% mana is meaningful but not as much as the quicker healing wave cast.  
---
But the first guy is right too, healing way is a HUGE buff for healing wave and without it it loses a lot of its potency
---
But there won't be in guilds
---
There actually is a "elemental" spell build that drops storm strike and picks up elemental devastation and that 9% melee crit node after a spell crit. 
---
With stacking apell power and boosting frost shock. It benefits from curse of elements and so more than melee crit. Its OK raid DPs and decent sustain but I honestly think its more of a work around than a good DPs spec compared to say a frost mage or dagger spec rogue.
---
My b fam
---
May i ask what you do for income if your able to play 8-10hours a day, i want to be able to do the same thing
---
But you do.
---
That shield is about to convince me to go engineering.... even though I want to go blacksmithing lol.
---
You’ll give up after a week, calling it now.
---
If you want to play only PvE it doesn't matter, dragons will die either way. In PvP being human with perception or dwarf with stoneform is going to make you win in quite a few scenarios where you would otherwise lose.
---
On the Vanilla realm I was on the world PVP dried up once battlegrounds were released so all you had left were groups multiple times larger than your own camping instance entrances and ganking everyone.
---
We once had to form up a couple of raid groups to clear out the gankers so people could enjoy the luxury of actually being able to enter ZG.
---
I don't quite get the logic behind people making out that playing on a PVP server is hardcore, the majority of PVP interactions just boil down to massively one sided fights that end almost immediately. 
---
WOW isn't even a game with any mechanics to punish you for death other than a corpse run and a repair bill which are considerably more tedious than it is hardcore.
---
Honestly don't get this. It won't be a disaster. Embrace being part of the international community, make friends and pick up a bit of English at the same time.
---
Even if they would make servers in my native language, I would never join them. The game is better in English, it's the only true original experience that exists, it was how the game was written and designed.
---
A book written by a British author reads better in English than in any other language. Call me a purist, but I truly believe that to be the case for video games as well.
---
If you honestly don't speak a word of English, find a guild pre-launch with a bunch of folks that do speak your native tongue and join their server. Done.
---
Sure its possible we don't know anything about serverside, but this would have the effect of skills occasionally returning the out of range error while the client shows them in range. I don't think Blizzard would do something like that.
---
I do get the point that you're trying to make. But I'd say being on time and being ready 10 minutes before the scheduled raid start time is simply a courtesy to your fellow raid team.
---
You want to be invited to the raid and ready to pull on time. Even a casual guild will have a "pull time" and be "be in the raid group" time. You dont want to be the one guy making 39 other people wait for you while you get your potions and flasks and food and THEN have to actually get to the raid. It's really selfish to everyone else and shows that you really dont care or consider anyone's time imprtant but your own.
---
 Just think of the time spent beforehand as you getting yourself ready for work and then driving there. No, they wont pay for that time you spent to get there. But if you dont put that time in then you dont get to hold down the job in the first place.
---
Any guild that needs everyone to have engineering for raids is bad at the game. fact.
---
I have every intention of playing on a PvE server as I did in Vanilla if for no other reason than that's what I did in Vanilla. That said, the hate PvE servers get is mostly in places with high concentrations of generally more hardcore WoW players, such as this sub and various forums dedicated to WoW. PvE servers will be plenty popular when Classic goes live.
---
"This is important because, under this paradigm...you are going to be seeing an entire realm's population worth of characters in the world all competing for the same spawns."
---
So he's stating that with layering you will be playing with "an entire realm's population worth of characters" but they can use layering to accomodate multiple realm's worth of characters on one "server." 
---
So, just to be clear, on day 1 you will be competing with a "realm's population worth of characters" in the main starting zones, so layering is fundamentally NOT a solution for quality of play.
---
Don't forget jumper cables.
---
Rogue, mage, paladin, shaman, druid, warrior, hunter warlock or priest are my favourites. They do very well depending of the situation and the counter.
---
They won't need it...but the good ones will require it.
---
Rogue &gt; the rest
---
the game cheats.
---
Huuuge find. Thank you, was tired of arguing with people here
---
Increased rep gain is useless. You can easily do 5% more work to get the reputation, and you can do flips.
---
Increased stealth is also useful.
---
Unpopular opinion: Paladins.
---
So your top picks are all classes?
---
Playing 8-10 hours per day you will be 60 in 2 weeks (about 125 hours). 
---
With slower classes 3 weeks max.
---
My understanding is 8.2 API is far more restrictive then 1.12. We could get away with a lot more, but because things were so new the limits were never really pushed. 
---
8.2 is much more restrictive because folks have had a decade to tweak and see what they can push / pull / get away with and Blizzard has responded in turn. 
---
As I understand it there have not been a lot of fundamental changes to the API aside from restricting various data points. So if we're getting 1.12 / .13 I would expect outdated mods from the 1.12 Era to function.
---
&gt; Just all the melee getting an extra 25 dps.
---
No. 94 AP is 6.5 dps, and you only buff your group. If you have a group of four warriors, any other group being sub-optimal, the talent will be worth a total of 26 dps. So if your enh shaman does 26 dps less than the other classes, he is a net dps loss compared to bringing a resto and trading a healer for a dps. This will pretty much always be the case.
---
&gt; dps/hps 
---
There is no hps coming from enh shamans (or no dps). You cannot gear for both roles, as +heal, +dmg/heal, int mp5 etc are worthless for melee dps and str/agi/ap for healing. Not to mention that you can't do both simulatneously in the WoW combat system. There is no synergy where the whole is better than the sum of the parts either, enh shams just have to choose and are worse than other classes/specs at both roles.
---
This is different than ele shaman who wear basically the same gear as resto, and so can operate at pretty high efficiency in both roles (just mana limited if they have to dps).
---
&gt;  somewhat usable
---
They are in the bottom three specs in the game for pve. I guess that's better than nothing. But unless you have so many healers that bringing a resto shaman would be silly, it's always better to have your shaman be resto and get an additional dps.
---
Hell yeah. Protect ya cow. Will you main hunter again?
---
I’m warlock and have friends
---
You don't tip in general
---
I need one of those! 
---
Could you provided directions to the &lt;Vendor&gt; please?
---
A simple test would be going somewhere in the beta with clear markings on the ground, screenshot the exact limits of melee range with and without leeway, then going to the same spot on 1.12 and compare it. I don't have the beta so I can't do it.
---
I hope you are 100% right! :P
---
Based on what, exactly? What did I say that is inaccurate?
---
I'm gonna have to play a tank so i can wear the sexy tier sets, not this space bug hunter armor. I mean it's cool but that's not the look i'm want to go for.
---
I tip Mages using conjured gold. It is similar to regular gold but disappears if you're logged out for 15 minutes.
---
I'm not arguing for or against, just informing. It seems clear that both leaving it in and removing it will ends in a non-vanilla experience because we aren't on dial-up 14 years later.
---
I flip flop every day it seems. Rogue &gt; Hunter &gt; Warlock and then back to Hunter. We’ll see what happens in August.
---
When did I say it was ok for dps to do that?
---
Lol 2/10 troll. Not believable enough.
---
Dumb question. You don't think there'd be buzz about realm names had there been a blue post about those?
---
I sadly did not get to experience these battles as I was merely a level 55 priest as TBC hit! :(
---
Many people weren't on dial-up back then either. I certainly wasn't.
---
This was pretty common in retail classic as well. Classic wow is a time consuming game. People rarely want there time in advancing a goal slowed by people playing an, inefficient build. If you want to "swim against the tide". It's hard and not everyone wants to help you do it. I think it's unfair to say people are being elitist. For me elitist is when you shit on a player who is trying to do everything right for not being good enough. It's not the idea you don't want to party with people playing things in a weakened state for no other reason then they like it. Some people can be pretty toxic about it though.
---
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING?
---
&gt;Edit:  With server / faction changes (which you know are going to be sold) you can always transfer to a PvP server after getting fully geared on a PvE one.
---
When/if they add transfers I'd expect it to be along the same lines they were back then. 
---
PvP -&gt; PVP
---
PvP -&gt; PvE
---
PvE -&gt; PvE
---
~~PvE -&gt; PvP~~
---
PvE wasn't originally allowed to transfer to PvP realms.
---
This or the warrior's set with kalimdor's revenge is awesome. That sworf is one of my favoritr, reminds me of a sword in PSO.
---
I'd definitely use it to solo level while watching tv.
---
I see what you did there! Massive upvote for amazing movie reference! :D
---
Have you played Vanilla? It was literally designed to be a casual MMO.
---
Indeed i do
---
Agreed. I don't know why we are sacrificing two weeks for the integretity of the game and it's values. It's astonishing to me how much traction layering has taken hold of in this sub.
---
Actually it’s exactly the same for me. Everytime i think I’ve got „the one“ it just takes 2-3hrs in this sub to change my mind.
---
Nothing.  I'll typically send a polite whisper to them and ask if I can have some free food/water.
---
I figure it rude for someone to just open a trade window and then expect food/water be placed in the trade window.  
---
Eventually, you'll find nice mages that will give it to you for free, since they're likely sitting idle in town anyway.
---
Now, portals, that's a different story.  You need to at least reimburse them for the rune to make the portal, I'll tip them if they use their own.  I'll probably try to get it for free (or tip less) if I provide my own rune to them.
---
Not that it was shit. But as people stopped back peddling and the nerfs kept coming it became shit.
---
I'd rather have free server transfers with a 6 month cooldown.
---
You should clarify your post with what exactly you mean. I take it you are talking about mages in cities giving out food/water after being whispered about it? Yeah they can charge for that.
---
 In a dungeon though it goes without saying it is free each and every time. Really shouldn't have to be said but figured if a new player is reading this.
---
Thats not the biggest issue, the biggest issue is posting memes on reddit instead of leveling and gear grinding to kill rag within 7 days.
---
I'd like to see shaman! I plan on leveling my first shaman (also my first horde character so I'm extra lost)!
---
Exactly! I’m glad to see others hopping in here to support fellow PvE players. It’s jjsy toxic when these hardcore folks do nothing but insult and try and shame. 
---
I love pvp and can’t wait for AB to be released. It’s always been my favorite, and I plan to even getting one 29 twink even for that scene. I’m not saying I won’t have a pvp server toon ever, just that it’s nkt high on my list of priorities, and it doesn’t have to be for anyone.
---
Have you played retail? We could probably get that goldfish that plays pokemon to clear all content.
---
I'd love if they communicated more, but they have nothing to gain from talking about layering. 
---
I think it's pretty obvious that they're still working on it. This isn't your average everyday beta, because Classic isn't your average everyday launch.
---
This is also in their print ads as well.
---
I was dead set on Hunter but then I saw how wonky the pet pathing was in the stress test and it bummed me out. Apparently it’s fixed so I’m back to not knowing.
---
The only people that are salty are the casuals that can’t be try hard. Everyone wants to use responsibilities maturity etc, but the thing is in life if you want to make time for something, you will.
---
It’s crazy to me the majority of the population can’t spend at least one hour in the gym everyday. But they can spend hours watching Netflix slamming food etc. 
---
People are hypocrites. Someone is going to be jealous that you have more time/knowledge/x. Get over it. Play the way you want. Hardcore or not but don’t cry if the hardcore smacks you down. That’s life.
---
Not an argument.
---
Do you remember/know of the "Black Daggers" guild?
---
you can heal as any spec for leveling dungeons man. I leveled my priest shadow and healed dungeons from 14-60 as shadow. As for raiding and high level dungeons, you will suffer. Specifically for shamans the resto tree has so much good stuff which i why most people spec 0/5/46. You can do dungeons fine with an ele/resto spec but you will hurt your guild in raids
---
Have you? Literally no-one is questioning the difficulty of raid mechanics.
---
ok, i take your word for it, more commenting on the fact i didn’t expect how many people would have a faulty understanding of how everything is calculated.
---
Well of course, but I'm just saying in normal situations it's better to try and gain a distance with wing clip or saving mana for the next raptor if you're low on mana compared to using it on an ability that will do like 100 damage or whatever the max rank is
---
I'd say that rogues, pending you're in stealth, get to choose their fights.  You have a lot of outs when things get sketchy as well.
---
Now, of course a Hunter will be a more direct counter to a rogue.  Warlocks as well, but they're also squishy.
---
I fee you. Why is rogue interesting for you?
---
Get max rank in arena, it actually takes skill where wow max pvp rank was just a grind, no skill required. Or mythic raiding. In classic, you can afk in a raid and get carried.
---
We all do, but everyone should be at a minimum.made fully aware of how weak it is in raids.
---
Aside from being able to see the content again, my main hope for Classic is that Blizzard will be able to look at it under a microscope and see what really works and what doesn't. What QOL features really add value to the MMORPG experience, and which QOL features come at a cost in terms of eroding the community or undermining the RPG experience?
---
Then with this information, MAYBE Blizz can go back to the retail game and use that insight to help guide their design philosophy in the next expansion... or maybe the next MMO.
---
Bear in mind that I'm saying this is the ideal outcome. For Blizz to pay attention to the idea, two things need to be true:
---
1) Classic has to be popular and have unexpected staying power, and
---
2) The playerbase needs to be honest and thoughtful about the pros and cons of the vanilla experience.
---
Given how cancerous the WoW community can be, I don't know how likely that is.
---
Ganking. Plus I’ve never played one at a high level and they seem fun. Bit of a learning curve but I feel like it would be fun once I got the hang of it. But then I remember I already know and like hunter... back to square one.
---
It's literally in the first post of this topic.
---
Ask Pshero.
---
I think that your wand list is really lacking.  Here is a list of all the wands, click on them and you can see who drops them:

---
I always thought T3 look more like VR Troopers than Power Rangers.
---
Fun is not relevant to whether it was harder.
---
The core design philosophy of vanilla isn't an argument? Ok.
---
Hide further around the corner then the tank does
---
Every second
---
Also worth mentioning that it doesn't activate if either you or your target is slowed by 50%
---
I believe that's what `v9` expresses, I can't remember exactly
---
Tanking dungeons isn't mutually exclusive from leveling...?  Tanking while leveling =/= minmaxing towards endgame
---
in pvp situations you will always use lhw
---
Thanks. Glad to know some part of memory serves me right.
---
My main impression hasn't been that people are praising classic because it's necessarily hard. Rather it's that nothing is handed to you, you have to work for things and it takes time.
---
Boomers will downvote you, but you’re right.
---
&gt;World PvP feels more special to me on a PvE server. 
---
Because it almost never happens, lmao.
---
Enjoy your PvE server.
---
^^^ya ^^^big ^^^carebear
---
All healing classes can successfully heal without being specced into their healing trees while leveling up to low 50s. Just have some additional items with Spirit/Int to make life easier.
---
If the actual code isn't enough for you I don't think that anything will be
---
Vanilla is easier in difficulty but way more grindi.
---
I prefer warlock T2 over T3
---
Hi friend. Former Arena Rank 1 here. Also Rank 13 in Vanilla and played on rank 1 RBG teams in Cata and did M+ up to 12 in BfA. The skill cap in the game has degraded every expansion.
---
Oh and the leveling phase as a rouge is way tougher...
---
Well with stealthbyou get to pick your fights.
---
Only a stupid rogue attacks someone he isn't garenteed to kill.
---
What's astonishing is the overreaction to the layering tech. I honestly am curious what you guys will all complain about when all these "huge problems" with layering end up being nothing.
---
Hey, thank you for this!
---
What boosters? There were no boosters.. some people would go to them, not bid on gear because they are broke and cant afford it, or even if they could they didnt care about better gear on that toon, then walk away woth a pile of gold. You dont want that in that type of raid, as an organiser of those raids you want people who will be bidding on items, more bidders, more gold at the end of the run.
---
&gt; shaman does 26 dps less than the other classes, he is a net dps loss compared to bringing a resto and trading a healer for a dps
---
while I agree with this if that's all that is cared about, dps isn't the only measure of worth. I still think bringing an ench shaman that benefits the melee group more than a resto would can be more beneficial.
---
I wasnt referring from switching from dps to hps mid fight, even though it is possible. I was talking about between fights, since shaman mail will be easy to come by. If a boss fight needs an extra healer a ench can bring a gear set to switch over to before the fight to provide the support needed. Even in the beginning of gearing one may have to mix and match gear.
---
It was never exactly good, but randomly one-shotting people was broken even if the class itself is terrible.
---
If you don't have a family it should be pretty doable around a full time job, if you have a routine where you can do all your chores in 30 mins a day, which I expect in respectable no lifer to achieve.  
---
**Work:** 40 hours  
---
**Sleep is 7*6:** 42 hours    
---
**Chores:* 7*.5:** 3.5 hours  
---
**Total left 168** - 85.5: 82.5 hours for gaming, or 11 hours a day on average
---
In another thread someone said they were going to do endgame raids in full "of Shadow Wrath" gear.
---
I just hope these people play opposing faction on the same pvp server as me.
---
Monday
---
This was always going to be the case. Guides and tactics are out there, and have been played to death for each and every instance. But classic was about the original journey. The story. The lore. Before Blizzard wiped it's arse with the rich histories they'd created and said "fuck it, they're hooked now...!"
---
It's a grind. Always was. Leveling my original 60 took weeks at a casual level. These days you can pretty much do 1-60 in the blink of an eye.
---
There was no hand holding back then. No sparkly quest items. No dots on maps. You had to read the quest to find out where to go. Level 40 mounts were a rite of passage. Class skills were an investment; Raids were rewarding. I'll never forget the night my RG took down Nefarian for the first time. It was an achievement. 40 people who had spent weeks and months wiping, finally killing him. It's a superb memory of mine.
---
As much as I agree with some things you say, I firmly believe that you're missing the point of it, entirely, but then if you weren't there at the beginning, you'll never fully understand and that's not your fault.
---
This is amazing, more King of the Hill/World of Warcraft classic memes!!
---
Just mages and warlocks lol 
---
But seriously vanilla raids are easier than current by a fair margin, but vanilla is more than raids.
---
I played horde in vanilla so I can't be certain but I remember Lawbringer not having taking stats
---
75s
---
Most of the healer specs are decent for pvp and (group) farming. outside of that no pve spec is 100% what you would want for a pvp or farming spec but some are close like:
---
MM hunter
---
Combat sword rogue (great spec for farming, good for pvp but not the typically rogueish spec with multiple vanishes and blinds and all that shit)
---
Fire mage (in the pve spec you really only lose blastwave/pyro, youll have most else from the tree)
---
Deep frost mage (every guild will have at least 1 deep frost mage to apply winter's chill to bosses which is a great farming spec and a pretty good pvp spec)
---
Shadow priest if you are your guilds 1 shadowpriest its a decent pvp spec
---
Fury warrior: great for farming, not super for pvp
---
WoW was more noob friendly with an already big community from past blizzard games.
---
What is rewarding is in the eye of the beholder. You might think something is a waste of time for another player the grind brings in other aspects that they get enjoyment from. Different strokes for different folks I guess the saying goes in English.
---
 Just play what you like, classic or modern WoW, easy.
---
You know how there's a "Caution: Hot" warning on coffee cups that you get from coffee places? Same thing here: someone needs to be told.
---
You spelled "best" wrong.
---
Sarcasm.
---
Thats not entirely accurate, but I can agree to some extent. I am more so commenting on your points about content being easier. Having done full AQ and Naxx up to Sapph when it was live content I would not consider M+12 to be on par with the level of difficulty of Naxx or even AQ without Naxx gear, nor are any of the raids since TBC. 
---
Aside from that, much of the complexity in PvP has been stripped away. Even in Vanilla you did not have the 1-2-3-isms as they’ve existed since Wrath (and TBC to a lesser extent), save for outlier gimmick classes (3 min mage, etc.).
---
You used to call people carebears when they would roll on pve servers. 
---
It has always been like this.
---
It still acts as a barrier. Just try the alt+z i mentioned its really so good.
---
So what you're saying is... you'd rather play versus the environment instead of playing versus players? 
---
;)
---
That looks outrageously refreshing
---
You still brought the moonkin for the crit buff, insect swarm debuff, and faerie Fire debuff. Oh and battle red and innervate and the occasional heals. They were still treated like a hybrid until about BT.
---
I believe the exact wording was "It will be definitely gone by phase 2 with world bosses but hopefully in a few weeks after launch"
---
Cool.
---
*clangs glass bottles of level 1 mana water together*
---
They didn't WF for 12 seconds...  It's not an issue.
---
WoW was far less grindy and more "casual," if you can believe it. :P 2004 WoW might be loads more involved than modern WoW with attunements, long leveling, rep and gold grinds, slow gearing, prized rare and super-hard-to-get epics, and a lot of other things, but it was *loads* easier on its playerbase than EQ.
---
Plus, it had a somewhat cartoony graphic style which even a couple years down the line still held up. Minor improvements were made here and there (I started playing in BC and now, going back and looking at the Classic Beta, it seems to me like the graphics on player models I started playing with were notably better than the ones on the beta, but it's been so long ago I'm not sure now), but the general style with hulking orcs and their mammoth shoulderplates or blocky dwarves with oversize weapons that it inherited from the RTS games where units needed to be more identifiable from a distance let it skate by when everything else was starting to go high-resolution.
---
I also think it was a lot of the marketing that went into it. Ozzy Osbourne, William Shatner, Verne Troyer and even Chuck Norris himself (eventually) appeared in commercials to promote the game. That made Warcraft a household name for *everyone*, not just gamers. My first real introduction to Everquest was Champions of Norrath, a multiplayer action beat-em-up RPG on PS2. I'd vaguely heard of it before then, but hadn't really given it a second thought. My first introduction to Warcraft, though, was Warcraft 2, and I'd played its expansion pack and all of Warcraft 3 and its expansion as well. Everquest's MMO propped up a couple tertiary properties, but WoW was built on best-selling RTS games that more casual gamers and even non-gamers had heard of. That counted for a lot and helped make it the juggernaut it became.
---
Almost!! Just kidding, Paladin was my main in Vanilla. It may not be this go around, simply for a different experience, but it will always hold a place in my gaming heart.

Yea dude I’d say it’s def worth it. The fear of that ultra-griefing lockdown scenario can get blown out of proportion and that doesn’t happen too much unless it’s a personal grudge. People will protect territory/resources/quest spots but the sociopath who lives to gank defenseless lowbies into deleting their accounts is pretty damn rare and will eventually get a bad rep and have it done to them.
---
&gt;There's a default layer that players start out on until that layer is considered overburdened within the zone, then they're shifted up.
---
I have a hard time believing this, because it's be sharding all over again.
---
I'm under the impression that you cannot switch a layer by changing a zone. You might be assigned a layer based on current zone population when you login though.
---
I can see how you came to your conclusion, but I this implementation wouldn't address the issue with sharding.
---
Player Continuity for instance. If I run from Durotar to the Barrens I should see the same people around me.
---
This is the intended behaviour confirmed [by the devs](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=410). 
---
This is not possible if I get layered out as soon as I enter the Barrens (because of overpopulation). 
---
Am I misunderstanding something ?
---
Yeah, if getting camped you switch to a bank alt or something, no biggie. Or I guess you could switch layer ;)
---
I mean, if you time it right, they still get 8-9 seconds of WF while the shaman is group swapped. Only lose 4-5 seconds of WF uptime.
---
This is why melee groups will be fighting over the token enhance shaman our raid will have. You want him? Prove you're worth it!
---
If you aren't going to play to PvP, PvP servers are just going to get in your way. It's detrimental to roll on one.
---
If you don't care how far your guild progresses, only want to raid 1 night a week and fully intend on saving your dkp on bonereaver as the MT or spinal reaper as the holy paladin to kill people, then you should roll on a PvP server.
---
Nothing wrong with being a carebear. You just don't want to partake of one part of the community. 
---
Most people rolling on PvP are only against PvE to PvP server transfers. They weren't in vanilla and you shouldn't be able to ezmode level and play always enabled PvP.
---
I honestly dont understand the obsession with streamers.
---
Then again idgaf about televised sports either...whats the point? Youre not there and youre certainly not playing
---
You forgot your /s
---
My dogs name is moose.
---
I was a GM back in the day and remember GM Island vividly, I never got to see Programmer Isle though.
---
&gt; I still think bringing an ench shaman that benefits the melee group more than a resto would can be more beneficial.
---
Why? Why would having four warriors each do ~ 7 more dps possibly be worth bringing someone that realistically will do 100+ less dps than their replacement? 
---
The only situation is if you have both too many healers such that it makes no sense for your shaman to heal, and also have so few shamans that you need one for your warrior dps group. Meaning you have to have a ludicrous number of druids and priests. 
---
&gt; bring a gear set to switch over to before the fight
---
Now this shaman requires double gear. Obviously won't be possible to do this when gear is still competitive. When things are on farm status and your enh shaman has a reasonable *second* set of gear, sure who cares. Caster/healer and tank/melee dps hybrids don't need a second set of gear as their main attributes can apply to both roles. So enh shaman (and ret and resto/feral) are comparatively bad in this aspect as well.
---
It sounds more likely, but thats just wishful thinking on your behalf I think.
---
Twinks would probably fall under the same category as the "kids camping lowbies" wouldn't you say? Most twinks are adults from my experience, so killing people weaker than you isn't really something reserved for children.
---
Early on GoA + Poisons is just as much dps as WF.    WF is kind of overrated.
---
Oh it's tuesday again ? Thanks OP, would've forgotten if not for our weekly repost :\^)
---
The way I've always seen it, there is pvp, and ganking.
---
I personally don't get much thrill out of killing people 20 levels under me, so much of what pvp servers actually offer me is getting spawn camped by people 20 levels over me.
---
To be clear, a major part of the appeal of pve servers is that most of the people who gank lowbies join pvp servers, lol.
---
With that said, pve servers with low amounts of people who flag for pvp can be too safe, and detract from the experience.
---
That's got me thinking, it'd be awesome if this subreddit would organize and populate a pve server with the intention of being pvp minded.
---
One question though, isn't it easier to reach Grand Marshal on pve servers? Since you have less competition for the rank
---
Mine is how you got into the ironforge fish tank
---
People around here don't have the most basic sense of living and letting other people live. This is happening because the game is happening, and so this sub became popular and is now filled with people who think their views are the best. And I'm not pinning that on age, but on maturity. 
---
Lots of man babies out here, thinking going hardcore, speedleveling and shit is the only way to enjoy the game, to then get at max level and realize they have to wait for everyone else anyway. 
---
When this sub got big it got toxic, that's how it goes.
---
Good news! Just don't play WoW for a few weeks at launch and layering will be gone by the time you show up. You were already planning on waiting to finish quests so it should be ok being behind the curve.
---
This sounds like a copy pasta
---
In one of the high rated leeway posts someone did a test in Ratchet. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5lvnp/leeway_mechanic_illustrated/
---
Can you try to find this same location and test at the same distances? Preferably, can you begin auto attacking the enemy player to make it more clear to the viewer when the target is in range and damage is actually registering?
---
Shaman were good all round in that expac. Ele had high early tiers burst, and enhance damage was excellent when they weren't dead or not standing next to things because TBC's general approach of fuck melee.
---
Clint Howard played on my server, someone in his guild said he was thinking about making a return.
---
r/hydrohomies

Unless you have a timer on your end showing the batching ticks on Blizzard's server you can't predict it. Hint: that is not in the available API for addons - I looked.
---
I've seen folks say that if you can get within 400ms of THE OTHER PLAYER'S ABILITY then you can fall in the batch - that's what you think from the looks of your post and you'd be wrong. You can be within 1ms and still fall in the next batch if that's how the server caught it.
---
Hell, a slight variation in your own ping by 1 or 2 ms can throw you in the next batch. It's 100% sheer luck you land in the same batch once you consider your own internet and that the tick is server-side, static and has no exposed API to exploit.
---
Except.. they're new to the game. They don't know what the marks mean. They don't know what interrupt means, and they're impatient because you're just standing around writing thingd they don't understand.
---
Better guilds doesn't ignore a more optimal strat, because "consumes".
---
Does anyone know what's the fastest way to get the first wand from enchanting fast? When i played the stress test i felt like it was hard to get early
---
I honestly don't understand the obsession with celebrities.
---
Then again idgaf about movies or tv shows either...whats the point? Youre not in them and youre certainly not an actor.
---
Wait, what? People can enjoy watching other people doing things despite not doing said thing themselves? Crazy.
---
I would say warrior is the best hybrid dps
---
That run up and first boss in SFK heroic killed so many lfg groups, especially cause nobody really knew what to expect from shadowfang keep at lvl 85.
---
That style of argument is fallacious and doesn't have any actual substance behind it.
---
Played a mage all through TBC, it's one click for water, but no I just make water and give it to people I group with, ya know, cause it's free.
---
PvP in vanilla required vastly different play based on classes, situations, consumables, numbers. BFA arena is trying to maximize a PvP rotation while keeping track of CD economy.
---
Mythic raiding is a fucking joke.  First boss is a loot pinata. Next 2-3 are a reasonable challenge. The rest you either gear for a month before you stand a chance, wasting 8+ hours weekly so you don't get Gkicked, or you play in a top end guild where you are expected to have 3+ characters geared to Max before the patch so you can stack 10 fucking warlocks.
---
It's to indicate sarcasm.
---
Grouped by and raid better be free...tip in capital city always appreciated but don't expect every mage to kust hand out lvl.55 water in capitals
---
People are idiots and don't know how to comprehend a sentence let alone check a username to know who is saying what to whom.
---
I see you know how to IDA.
---
I'm guessing its because if they tried to design a Staff-like image that it would probably just end up looking like a dong.
---
It's a bit silly to use Mythic raids as a comparison for what the average WoW player would find more difficult, considering the average WoW player isn't raiding Mythic difficulty raids.
---
I really don’t understand why people are so upset about layering.  I’m not convinced any of you actually played vanilla at launch because it was horrible and borderline unplayable for weeks.
---
Layering is blizzard trying to give us modern server scalability/infrastructure in a less invasive way than sharding.  Is it perfect, no.  Is it reasonable solution to give the most people a chance to enjoy the launch of classic, yes.
---
Might try furor and Respec around the 31st then... At least in the private server I definitely can fairly frequently change forms multiple times in combat. Big diff between my current level, 25, and the 31st talent at lvl 41.
---
aight buddy
---
https://i.redd.it/mxwcfyzk3y731.png
---
Let's start with some honesty. I'm crap at wow pvp.
---
Now, to the matter of the topic, I will play on a PVE server because I feel like world PVP ruins the immersion of the rpg aspect of the game.
---
One might say that "horde vs alliance" is the core of the storytelling in classic. However when I know that behind that rogue camping me there's a just another nerd like me.... Well, that ain't epic.
---
So I prefer to play a game where I team up with other nerds to overcome the amazing content Blizzard crafted for us. Without making anyone's life miserable.
---
No, someone in the raid switches the shaman in the melee group to the caster group to drop Mana tide totem.   Then they put him back.  The melee are without WF for all of 6 seconds.
---
You're still not solving the issue of 50 dead realms 6 months on if the pops do drop like all known data suggests. I agree that a zerg at launch is a blip on the radar. But 50 realms with only 1k players on each further on would be ten times worse than initial layering. Why are people so ok with realm merging, but not layer merging within the same realm?
---
I've just levelled to 60 on a post-Naxx pserver with an insanely toxic player base and up to 12k players ingame. I skipped STV and Hillsbrad where I hear it is bad but I was never camped. I probably died to 'unfair' pvp 1-2 times per level from 22-60. I never attacked anyone unless they had attacked me in the past (VanasKOS is an awesome addon) so I didnt wind up any alliance until I got to lvl55 and could start killing people trying to gank in LHC/gadg.
---
Classic won't have bored lvl60s for sometime so will be an even easier levelling experience than that. Just keep your head down, don't antagonize the other faction and if you are camped just do something else on an alt.
---
While I'm glad someone finally found a 100% proof leeway was in Classic I think the biggest problem in the entire discussion is not whether players should or should be affected by leeway but rather if the mobs should.
---
There will always be "Elitist Jerks" and "Lazy Casuals".
---
They were part of the community then and they will be now. Don't expect everyone to want to play the same way you do. Try and find a group of players or guild that has the same mindset as you so you can enjoy playing the way you like to play.
---
Think of it this way, a casual might feel like they are being told how to play, but from the elitist's view the casual looks like they are being lazy and wants to get carried. That's why it's important to try and group with like minded individuals so everyone is on the same page.
---
Improved WF is absolute fucking trash.   Anyone that tells you to get that is a moron.  It adds like 3 dps per melee.
---
I'm really thinking this too. I might have an hour to spare to log in. I can't crush WoW like the good old days.
---
You’re thinking of the Burning Crusade, came out in 2007. Further expansions came after.
---
Why would they make two expansions? One for the current WoW and one for Classic?
---
Classic is just a side project, a fan service.
---
They might make TBC and WotLK «Classic», but Classic isn’t WoW 2.
---
Wish my friends saw it that way. Thanks though
---
&gt; Name changes
---
Not necessary when splitting a server. Only when merging.
---
&gt; I understand not wanting to play in a starting zone with hundreds of other people
---
This isn't the issue that layering is attempting to solve, or it would be limited to those zones. It's the overall population. The alternative to layering isn't (just) crowded starting zones, it's a login queue.
---
Any other interesting things you found? (If you don’t want to reply just PM me.) I’m about to reverse engineer some of the game files with ghidra.
---
WSG isn't run by default, not because of honor/hr, but because it only lets you fit 10 guys into a premade. It's more efficient and less headache to generally run an AB group for 20 people.
---
During WSG weekend the bracket splits in half, with two groups of 10 running seperately.
---
Gnome rogue is actually the best, imo.  That racial that allows you to break snares is pretty badass for pvp.  Human would be best for pve because of the +5 to swords.
---
OP is right. Raiding mechanics in vanilla are LFR tier and PvP ranks is all about the grind and dodging difficult matches.
---
I think GoA is underrated. That extra agility can really help with survivability and DPS on certain classes. I remember bear tanks being big fans, especially as WF doesn't prof for em.
---
I remember the Beaststalker set before it changed, I actually really liked it before, was kind of bummed they change it. It looked like the old dragonstalker set, just blue.
---
Lol why would that be down voted.
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
Did anyone claim it didn't exist? The problem is how absurdly huge it seems in classic
---
Preach. People are so invested in others opinions it destroys their own experience.
---
I remember seeing "V v V" around but I was a nobody most of Vanilla (damn altoholic). I was only in Black Daggers as a friend and not a real raider lol.
---
Lol. You have things so backwards. Please read the blue post. You sound like a typical retail fanboy who just parachuted in here.
---
I’ll say it again because you’re thick. Layering does nothing for the initial rush you’ll still have 500 people in northshire with you
---
Replying here so I’ll remember to revisit. You guys seem cool, and could probably use a dane within your ranks too :-)
---
I just would love to see the days played of people with suboptimal gear cause they most likely spend a ton of time in gray screen walking back to their corpse.
---
I don’t care if it’s easier. At least in classic there won’t be gear resets every 4 months and it will feel like an mmo where you need other people to do stuff.
---
These types of comments basically constitute low-effort memes at this point.
---
I fucking knew some huge difference between private servers and actual vanilla was gonna be found. Well what does this mean ?
---
I wouldn't be surprised, just disappointed.
---
you must be new to reddit rofl it's all one giant copy paste circle jerk
---
Another comparison post. Its two different games tbh. It just shares the name WoW. People line vanilla cause things lasted etc etc. nobody is claiming raids and/or pvp was harder. And why wouldnt premade wsg be just as skilled?
---
Umm not sure how much hardcore raiding you have done in classic but, it's all about speed. I know a lot of hard core guilds who would not tolerate dropping dps for even a second because, their dps don't wanna use consumes. Keep in mind Iv'e seen guilds so helbent on speed they are knocking down even the vaunted Naxx bosses at 30-45 seconds a pop.
---
Sorry but i prefer Pugs all night
---
When WoW launched I played Prot Pally and Balance Druid (Eventually shifted to warrior BECAUSE REASONS WELL KNOWN TO ALL.  Let that sink in.  Get out of here with this #nochanges.  #*some*changes is fine with me.  You have had private servers for YEARS and you don't trust Blizzard to touch our precious I get it.  I am more than willing to allow tweaks if it means it brings all specs into viability.  WHAT IS THE POINT OF EVEN EXISTING IF YOU ARE A POINTLESS WASTE OF LIFE.  *Viability does not equal perfect balance among all classes.*
---
Lol yeah. As horde this thread making me jealous
---
I didn't know it was even being developed until the release date announcement was on the front page of reddit. I texted a friend of mine who had no idea about it either. I think some advertisement would do a lot of good and get a lot of people who probably haven't touched WoW in years back again.
---
Ah yes, the guys who say GO GO GO and CMON TANK HURRY and then are sheepishly quiet the rest of the dungeon once they cause a wipe. One of my least favorite MMO player types. GOGo gogoGO!!!!!!!!
---
Imagine the shitstorm if that happened today lol.
---
I guess if you tell a lie enough it becomes truth.
---
is he hot?
---
Same....Probably gonna do it again when they do it this month too.
---
Maybe it's different for each class. As hunter it's just easy going with beasts 1-3 levels higher.
---
With my math thats a 50 million dollar profit, the marketing etc is part of the budget. Still, with China as well, it was a huge success with profit.
---
Touche
---
Not for me :D My girlfriend envys how easy I can fall asleep just like that. The other day she asked me to just lay down on the floor and see if I could.
---
Put a blanket and a pillow and fell asleep within a minute. Its both a blessing and a curse!
---
I imagine the majority of us have played at the launch of servers, whether it's in vanilla or the launch of private servers, and have dealt with the sheer chaos and inability to quest. 
---
I genuinely would prefer it over layering.  If you don't understand why people are upset about layering I think you aren't trying very hard to understand.
---
Oh the PvE rotations are a total joke in vanilla. The raids are going to be a breeze for most people. None of this make BFA any better. It's still just as shit, as it was before you posted.
---
The slow effect can be resisted independently of the damage component of Blizzard and the UI may not show that resist.
---
When blizzard-kiting a pack of mobs it's not uncommon to have the mobs constantly varying their speed as they occasionally resist the slow effect, even if they're constantly under the blizzard visual effect.
---
That's a big part of why I hate using blizzard grinding. I've always been a backpedal-in-a-circle CoC+AE kiter. If some mob resists the CoC slow it's easy to get it back with the pack for a frost nova reset.
---
If you would like to I can record a clip for you in the beta. Im lvling hunter and no, they dont have huge range against me when I kite. I could do it tomorrow evening if I find time, otherwise some other day this week.
---
CATA killed WoW for me.  It isn't about the world size so much as it changed too many core mechanics of the game for my taste. (ALSO IF FUCKED UP THE WORLD LOL) TBC and LK brought all specs to a decent point of viability without breaking too much class advantages over others.
---
You do realize how layering works right?
---
It existed, and it sucked
---
As far as quest/weapon progression goes I don't remember at all. All I really remember was the skill tree for Marksman PvP. [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cxZxVq0thtcbVV](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cxZxVq0thtcbVV)    
---
This looks like something fun to research and plan out for a Hunter though. I was mostly just planning on progressing through the zones and hoping for a somewhat decent weapon upgrade every so often along the way without targeting something specific.
---
Ignoring the many reasons why that's an absurd suggestion, it could be a few months, not a few weeks.
---
Oh okey, I understand it but it makes even less sense tbh :p
---
Seems the numbers in the video are accurate to vanilla.  Non-tauren have a 5 yard range, so 7.66 is "about 8 yards" like he was getting.  And with the tauren's 7 or 8 yard range (can't find a good source on an exact number), 9.66 or 10.66 is about "i dunno, 10 yards, 11 yards" as he was estimating.  
---
I think the fact that the field of view was changed is compounding some of what people are perceiving as being "too far".
---
You dont start mc/onyxia with the same team you enter naxx with. There are always trials and new people being geared up. We were still doing it ad we progressed through naxx. I joined late on the second time through and was wearing r10 and being thrown scraps.
---
Well here is to the old guys riding once again!
---
Being 14 and thinking you are cool on the internet was indeed fun, thankfully most of the classic players will be mature 26-38ish if its mostly old school players comming back.
---
If you have a relatively current weapon,     maybe something from ZF at lvl 48, it can be worth. It's also nice to break up the monotony of grinding too sometimes. Also Im suuuuuure if you get a corehound tooth or the like and fully spec firestone you can get some good dpm.
---
&gt; Not necessary when splitting a server. Only when merging. 
---
Yes, obviously. And merges may be necessary. It's possible to end up with too few or too many with this system.
---
&gt; This isn't the issue that layering is attempting to solve, or it would be limited to those zones. It's the overall population. The alternative to layering isn't (just) crowded starting zones, it's a login queue. 
---
Except when Blizzard first announced any kind of sharding, and when they announced layering, it was about population in starting zones. Which is why there was so much talk about limiting it to those zones.
---
Since it seems you actually don't know why layering is being implemented:
---
&gt; We recognise that launching WoW Classic poses a couple of meaty challenges.  
---
Unlike launching a traditional game that’s brand new, where you can assume that everyone that’s jumping in there on launch day has the intent to at least explore playing it long term, we expect that early on with Classic, there are going to be some people who are there die hard, dedicated, they’re racing to defeat Ragnaros and Onyxia.  
---
There are going to be *others who just want to check it out casually and they just want to see what all the fuss is about, they want to see what they missed.*  
---
And, our concern is, I think it’s exactly as you suggest, *what’s that going to look like?* What’s that going to do to *realm communities*, as some *server populations may dwindle over time*?  
---
That is where we are looking at using sharding in a *very limited way*.  
---
We understand, and *I* understand completely, that sharding is antithetical to a cohesive Classic community.  
---
We are competing over limited resources. When Lord Kazzak is up, and guilds are racing to defeat him, there needs to be only one Lord Kazzak. You’re trying to get, you know, if you’re trying to lock down the thorium vein spawn in limited sections of the world, you should be competing over limited resources.  
---
**That said, when everybody is packed into Valley of Trials, when everybody is packed into Elwynn, we think we can use sharding there in a limited, time limited way, to solve the initial launch day load problems, while making sure in the long run, that as server communities solidify, there’s a healthy population as single worlds for everyone to live in.** 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w)
---
Even with layering, the Beta had queues. And Layering will not fix anything to do with queues. They are still layering one server. If that server is full, there is going to be a queue. If the login servers are being bombarded, there is going to be a queue.
---
Thats how we are going to play =) Me and my friends are a group of DnD players who will play RP (hopefully RP PvP) together. Itll be a blast!
---
I don't see much point in it. Most healing specs are pretty easy to master at endgame. I'd say it'd be faster and better leveling to just go as DPS when leveling even with a partner.
---
When you are using world buff exploits, then it doesn't matter what you do, because you have broken the game.
---
Nah that's not cringe at all fella. I think it's great! That's what it was all about back then.
---
&gt;Also, it was totally possible to get shaman drops in an alliance raid, or pally drops in a horde raid, and since those items take up a loot slot on the boss kill, they were always frustrating to see.
---
This was only on prepatch iirc
---
That's only true if you tell people! My plan for premade acceptance is 18/2/31 shadow but I'll  gear for spell damage and tell everyone I'm disc. Since all I do is dispel, shield, rank1 sw:p, mana burn, mind control and throw emergency heals I'm hoping nobody will notice... will have to see how it goes.
---
I stand corrected, my memory told me it was August 20th for some odd reason.
---
Gul'Dan cheats!!!
---
EQ was insanely popular in it's time but EQ2 which was released along side WoW failed to gain traction.  I consider it had much to do with the art style.  I also feel like EQ2 catered to the solo player, and failed to create the need for group cooperation.  One thing I did enjoy very much about EQ2 was the quest line to change factions which was quite the grind but very fullfilling.  EQ2 was a great game, ahead of it's time even, but lost the popularity contest.
---
have you considered that on the beta, mob tagging lowers the main person's xp gained even if the other people aren't grouped? might be a bug tho
---
example: ungrouped person 1 tags mob, does 10% of dmg on mob
---
ungrouped person 2 through 15 one shot the mob, does remaining 90% of dmg
---
person 1 gains 10% of the exp that the mob normally gives and the loot drop
---
now you could powerlevel person1 through questing, or heal them/give them thorns/buffs etc, but doing any dmg reduces xp gained. 
---
I saw a pretty low viewcount streamer testing this about a week ago on beta so.
---
I've made more friends on Nost and the successor servers than irl. Guild meetups are also very cool.
---
I had an alt paladin up to about lvl 44-45 on friends account before i got my own and i was tanking up to (including) uldaman. 
---
Don't recommend, even if i was noob, threat was an issue when someone got juicy crit or getting enough aggro fast enough to sort of replace lack of taunt. 
---
Doable? Yes. Viable? To an extent, maybe decent when got enough gear. Efficient/optimal? Hell no! At least as leveling. 
---
On a side note i was able to kill 6x lvl 45 troggs and 47 quest trogg without leaving combat while lvl 42. Hell of a ride but that sense of accomplishment... Was sweet.
---
No? Do you actually know what pseudocode is? That's just in compiled code aka source code.
---
Pseudoclde would be if you wrote it in normal language like:
---
If CLIENT is player and TARGET is player and both are moving:
---
    Set range to range + 2.66 yd
---
Good Bot.
---
5,334 days... LIVE TO WIN!!!
---
It was just like this in retail, I had to reroll from my hunter at around naxx because the class was falling off too hard
---
Min maxing try hard are a funny breed
---
Fake News
---
I dont know how people don't see that layering is about more than just a smooth launch. They're obviously trying to minimize costs for this project, and don't want to go overboard with servers on launch. They know that its easier to make more servers due to demand than it is to just get rid of dead servers.
---
Essentially the way it works is based on the number of people buffed (including pets). It should work in classic given the 2.0.1 patch notes included a fix that battle shout was causing too much threat.   
---
The general rule of thumb  for AoE threat is &gt;5 enemies demo is superior. &lt;5 enemies Battleshout is superior. You'll want to weave sunders/revenges in to optimize threat when it's less than 5 mobs of course.
---
If I remember correctly, poison dmg scale(d?) on SP not AP.
---
I honestly don't give a shit about retail. I just wanna play Vanilla. The game I love.
---
It was a joke tbh. But who in their right mind calls their source file pseudocode!?
---
I have to mention generally that highly complex algorithms are written is pseudocode first all the time.
---
125k is an obscene amount for classic. That's months of farming, good lord. That must have been a guild purchase?
---
Heart of the wild is just too good while leveling, should get that asap, same with leader of the pack. You don't really need NS or furor while leveling. The only talent I would suggest spending points into early on outside of the feral tree is 1 point nature's grasp incase you get into some pvp, it will help.
---
oh stfu u big baby
---
I might be going warrior because I'd love to try tanking and I honestly don't have the time or care to deal with world pvp. I'll be a walking target dummy. I can see why a lot of people enjoy it, the sense of danger, etc etc, but I only get a few hours a day to play and wouldn't want to spend half of it running back to my body.
---
Blizzard needs to open Beta for more players. That's the only way they'll identify maximum potential issues to be addressed. Maybe a cheaper subscription model would be sufficient.
---
I play on private servers. Griefers are almost exclusively undead and almost exclusively undead rogues. That's why your experience as a Horde didn't encounter these people. They literally spend all their time camped in places like Duskwood and Redridge and they only go back to their city to resupply.
---
Great idea OP, it looks really nice! Lot’s of good info I’m here also.
---
letterkenny?
---
It's been fun reading through this thread lol. He's literally posted like 20 times and just never replies to the videos proving him wrong...
---
might be easier and better looking to just have everything fade out over time
---
when a cooldown finishes, the ability pops up on your screen then fades out.  when you take damage health bar appears, fades out.  probably leave the minimap up, but get rid of all the clutter buttons like mail and tracking and the border unless you hover over it or something
---
Why? They've already made several modern changes to the game
---
That would only be the case if threat is the limiting factor in DPS. In my experience tanking pre-60 dungeons, that is almost never the case.
---
A hunter reference poster/wallpaper would be sweet. If you find one somewhere make sure to let us know.
---
Let me describe leveling in EQ.
---
For most class in most situations solo leveling was impossible. In EQ, every mob outside the newbie zones is the equivalent of a WoW elite or stronger.
---
There also was no mob leashing. If you agrod a mob and ran, it would chase you until you transitioned to another zone entirely.
---
For these reasons, most leveling occurred in parties. Your party position itself directly on top of a location where a pack of mobs would spawn and killed them every respawn. Grinding for an hour might yield 1/20th of a level. You would not move, because moving might aggro other mob packs around you and if they overwhelmed you had no chance of escape -- you could try to "train" the mobs to the zoneline but you'd probably all die.
---
Speaking of death, if you died in EQ you respawned in your home city naked. It doesn't matter that your corpse is two continents away. If you care to retrieve the gear on your corpse, you must travel to it -- naked, past all the mobs in between (who are like WoW elites and chase you forever if you agro them and one-shot you because your naked when they catch you). Also every time you die you lose roughly a half-hour's grinding worth of experience.
---
I don’t get wrapped up in losing in a game. Is it frustrating to get your ass kicked in a game? Yeah, but I’ve never really raged over getting ganked. If it’s continuous then I just call my guild buddies over and we start banking back.
---
At lower levels, shields essentially double a warrior's total armor.
---
Worst part is you cannot get revenge while leveling. Generally, it is a textbook example of Displaced Aggression.
---
I get killed in Hillsbrad at lv 20 by some chode 60 and end up kill innocent Alliance players by 60. You only get justice when you write down names and stay in it for the long run.
---
RemindMe! September 4th
---
You're right. Classic is easier. That's not the point though. Vanilla was a community based game with rading and Pvp. Retail is a raid and Pvp based game with no community.  
---
If retail still had a healthy community aspect and hadn't gotten so bloated, I'd probably still play.
---
No way bloodlust was party-wide in BC? Right? Am I really remembering it that badly?
---
It didn't stop the half decent ones, but it surely more than a few bad guilds have been cu**** by C L A S S I C.

Is it worth getting blackout while leveling on a pvp server?
---
As someone who has done it, you're gonna pass out when you stand up.
---
If you're a casual player no, it doesn't matter. If you want to do competitive PvP against skilled players then yeah it does, dwarf is better for that. As for PvE same thing there, human if you want to minmax but you'll be fine as a casual raider
---
Couldn't you activate stealth after eating by default, though?
---
This. Between the heavy grind, long combat and huge death penalties and such, EQ catered far more to the hardcore crowd with all its excessively time consuming elements.   
---
    
---
The reason WoW came out on top though is because Blizzard was already considered the child prodigy of the gaming world at the time, they could do no wrong, their game releases were back to back successes, amassing a huge fanbase prior to WoW's launch. It also helped that they had a very fleshed out world and lore that players were already familiar with through WC1-3.  
---
MMORPGs were still a super niche genre in the early 00's, WoW and Blizzard's rabid fanbase is what brought them into mainstream gaming culture.
---
Can you press the "Play" button for Beta: World of Warcraft Classic?
---
- Yes? Beta.
---
- No? No Beta.
---
I'm having trouble finding gear with Intelligence stats though, all my stuff has Intellect
---
This is exactly what is missing from modern WoW. Not cringe I am excited for the same reasons.
---
yes?? lol
---
No need to feel foolish. Ever seen an orc rogue?
---
gratz carebear
---
also have to add in here - Staves can be super powerful early on due to the slow swing time, and top end damage.
---
Anything but warrior lawlz
---
Wasn't it 8 yards for 2h weapons in vanilla? A tauren wielding a 2h weapon should land somewhere around 12 yards if I remember correctly.
---
Hmm, actually you might be onto something... Apparently the word pseudocode is used by a few people to describe decompiled code... Though it seems to be an informal use of the term, never heard it used like that myself. But nevertheless I googled it and can see a couple of results of people using it like that to described decompiled source code. No references to pseudocode meaning decompiled code from any academic sites, in the 5 min search I did though 🤷‍♂️
---
Mate. I am not saying that any weird feeling mechanic is better for you. If you thought that was my point you misunderstood.
---
I have been around at two pserver launches where there was 0 leeway mechanic. The outcry was huge. Melees just can't hit anything.
---
We all want melee hits to feel right. This is currently not the case on classic beta. But getting rid of any sort of leeway mechanic would feel just as shitty. Just the opposite way pretty much.
---
I mean you don't have to believe me. But I am not trying to tell people that what they want is somehow wrong. We all want melee hits not to have 12 yards range. But we also don't want to have a *negative* range, because that is what 0 leeway feels like.
---
This has been the most enlightening thing I have read all day. Op must be proud he can come up with a gravity defying analysis. Classic is too easy now I’m going to put it down.
---
Uther, Arthas, Tirion, Turalyon.
---
2.6 yards on top of the range of the weapon. If you're using a two hand weapon the range is 8 yards which would make it 10.6, for a tauren it would be a bit further.
---
Wtf, extremely broken
---
Definitely not just teens. There are some people that never grow out of this stuff.
---
Malygos ftw!
---
Hunter were common.
---
The rep grind can also be leveling right?
---
I'm in the #nochanges camp and even agree with him. Keeping things like this same is as silly as capping the framerate and making everyone use CRT monitors.
---
8 + 2.6 is still 10.6
---
The meters matter a lot since the area increases by a square of the radius
---
oO can specs be seen in Classic?! I'll be in pvp/stamina/spell dmg gear so I'll look like a pvp disc priest.
---
Yes to all, but your pet doesnt "automatically" learn it. You have to take the pet back out if the stable and teach it to him with the Beast Training window.
---
With a Healthstone, also will keep them in mind and trade them another one later (assuming we're in a dungeon/raid).
---
P.server bois
---
WC3 was an incredible game.
---
It’s 5 yards for all weapons and for Taurens it’s 7 yards. Currently in the beta with leeway it’s 11-12 yards and Taurens have something stupid like 14+ yard range.
---
goes by ticks, also procs off Shadowguard
---
Doesn't really make sense if they're actually fighting VC?
---
You're really trying too hard to make your original point be less shitty and uninformed about PvP server mechanics.
---
Hunter, druid and rogue are the best wpvp classes. World pvp isn't 1v1 duels, there is a big difference. These 3 classes have the ability to disengage from almost any battle (super important, wpvp isn't just about killing but also about not dying) And they also have the ability to prevent the opponent from escaping (80% of the time in wpvp they will run from you, not fight) 
---
Sure shadowpriests are stronger 1v1 but they have almost no way to stop someone from running away and they go oom quickly. They also have no way to escape, if you see someone you can't beat (for whatever reason ur low mana/low hp, he has insane gear etc) coming towards you, you're stuck.
---
.. we still don't know anything about how the server handles it
---
thats the mindset i want everyone to have for classic!
---
I’m an adult with a job. Fuck pvp servers. I hated playing on them as a college student and I’d never even bother in classic.
---
The fact that this is just before the server was being shutdown is a very significant detail. Explains why so many people where begging and all in one place. I understand wanting to get your mount and it's not like the other players could take it with them.  Doesn't really explain the PvP server though.
---
It’s not working because it’s not meant to work. It’s a private server bug afaik
---
That’s Aoe leeway buddy
---
This is a solid post
---
I want 2020 classicwow community to be less horrible than 2016
---
I agree with him. The class and talent changes made this game significantly easier. People were surprised how easily streamers did dungeons, and the reason for this was because of class changes. When we get to mc and bwl it will be a joke on 1.12 build because everything got significantly stronger through patches.
---
Please don't go for improved shadow word pain. If you are fighting non-elites for 24 seconds, you are doing something *tremendously* wrong.
---
Also please don't respec to shadow that early.
---
&gt;What?? Layering exactly solves the issue of 50 dead realms. Layering means they only made 10-25 realms to start (with 2-5 layers on each), and then removed layers as they stopped being needed. Leaving you with 10-25 realms that are healthy pops down the line.
---
But this can also be solved by merges.
---
&gt; Imagine multiple realms that all share an economy and AH from the start. That's effectively what layering gives you. 
---
Yes, I know exactly how it works. I've been playing the Beta.
---
&gt; Server merges is more harmful to the economy because you're suddenly merging two separate AHs and the prices for stuff will drastically shift during the merge. 
---
It's actually less harmful if you consider people abusing layering to stockpile rare/limited resources. Also, this is really a non issue as the prices will balance out.
---
&gt; Your only argument is "what if the pops don't go down". They absolutely will. Blizz has mountains of data on their end regarding pops over time. They will go down. You're basing your whole argument on something that won't happen. We're not going to have 15k pops at launch stay 15k six months on. 
---
No. I have several points to my argument. You are just choosing to ignore them. You actually address one other point in this response.
---
That point wasn't "what if pops don't go down". Yes, I agree, pops will go down. The point was "What about the inevitable server that doesn't go down". Because there will be at least 1 server where the pop is going to stay up the entire time. And if the final pop, after merging all layers, is over 5k, that's too much.
---
X-wing alliance is a game just about navigating 3 dimensions. People who don’t like 3D navigation don’t play it.
---
Like the information provided and the presentation. 
---
Only negative I have is that the talent build is for single target not for AOE leveling which is counter intuitive when also listing AOE zones. 
---
Additionally a list for what level you get each spell at would be amazing :) 
---
Overall good job OP.
---
Depends when you play. Honor system wont be out at launch. In P2, honor system is introduced and youd have to make an effort to go and find people to kill so it might be difficult at lower levels to get R2. Around 40+ish you should be able to get R2 with a little bit of effort. In P3 with WSG released, at level 19, itll take quite a few hours, like probably like 10, to get R2. At 29, probably get that in half and 39 proabbly half that again.
---
Bandwidth has gotten better. Lag and ping have not changed a huge amount
---
in the deep dive he mentions: shadow oil, oil of immolation, dragon breath chili, and elemental deck. in another video i saw weapon procs and poisons.
---
I disagree. There are other of moments inbetween fights in battlegrounds or in world PvP when the combat is done, but about to start back up shortly. Also, if you're healing a target but enemies aren't on you yet, and the target is above half, healing wave (with talent) might be a better choice
---
Most situations call for LHW, but considering we're talking about a 5% mana reduction, I think the exchange is on favor of improved Healing Wave.
---
I'm pretty sure that it had ranks. Only different was dmg and mana cost. Last rank was about 50 dmg iirc, first like 5-10.
---
Wowhead has some IIRC
---
You could have googled this and it would have saved you from typing all that up, of course there are guides
---
RP-PvE represent!
---
It'd be warranted today. Back in 2004 they had just finished making a goliath of a game, the size of 3-4 wow expansions, so it's excusable.   
---
But if it happened today in an expansion there would be little justification
---
Friends, guildies and group members - free
---
People beside me - 1g
---
People expecting me to wait 5 min or come to them - 5g
---
He probably meant 125g.
---
I would never join a guild that uses Loot Council as a method to distribute loot. It opens the doors to abuse it. I had so many bad experiences with corruption where the raid lead supplied raid members with loot for gold (No not the guild bank, the money went directly into the raid leaders pocket) or some raiders and raid leaders were close friends. Ofc they got a „friend bonus“. It was obvious that they pursued nepotism so the guild disbanded relatively quick. Never ever again thanks.
---
So what you need to check now that when a target is snared below 50% does it apply the "ISWALKING". If that's the case melee leeway wouldn't apply to snared targets or mobs
---
Go for spirit and stamina. On a PvE server you would ignore everything except for spirit. On a PvP server it's mostly about stam. Sure, int is nice but your priority is not to die before you can act.
---
Why? People say it's because of laggy connections back then but we're talking about the mid 2000s, a lot of people were already on broadband.
---
Everquest was a fun leveling experience. All it remember was leveling characters and never doing anything beyond that lol but I was young. Then I found wow and my life was changed
---
EQ was amazing. It had PVP but it was the equivalent of people with a ton of resilience playing, you couldn’t burst anyone down you just had to wear them down.
---
Will I though?
---
I agree with healing while leveling. I've done that before. But considering this is a hybrid spec and still has 21 points in some restoration improvements, surely it's still viable...
---
Murloc chopper level 30 or 40?
---
Also is the doomulus prime quest going to be in at release? Or will that be a much later phase? AQ phase?
---
The X spam
---
I have heard that the leeway was extended in Cataclysm and the beta has these values instead of the original 1.12 ones. No sure about that though.
---
I know zero about code but is it possible that the bonus 2.66 yards is not additive for two players moving?
---
What I mean is, the bonus range caps at 2.66 yards whether either player is moving as a fixed distance buffer, but the Beta somehow has it extending to ~5.33 yards with both players moving? 
---
This is the only thing my little brain could come up with.
---
Mind Flay is pretty bad until later levels. It give or take breaks even at 44. It is clearly better at 52. It is absolutely garbage before 36 and worse than other options at 36.
---
i never said you were wrong, or i disagreed, just that statement sounded like the blizzard one. Just a simple comparison, no need to get bent of shape.
---
Sure but ping was awful. That's the primary thing leeway was intended to combat. It's just unfortunately that they hardcoded a specific value regardless of how good your internet is. Since ping is barely an issue anymore, it would actually be *more* vanilla-like in terms of feel if leeway was either removed or at least greatly reduced.
---
That's the ideal. Until you try to safe people, draw aggro and then they run away and let you die.
---
It works on a pserver but it did not work in vanilla. I am unsure about classic as I do not have access.
---
I was a rogue back in vanilla and specifically rolled for +magic damage gear. I had over 300 magic damage gear in the end just to test this specific thing.
---
I tried shadow oil, dragon breath, oil of immo, elemental deck, fiery enchant and poisons. It made no difference.
---
Wow this is great. Would be amazing to have one for every leveling dungeon.
---
EQ had really really really bad graphics. Also, fighting mobs was like rolling a die, and you basically needed a group just to wipe your ass.  And you lost xp when you died.
---
I've never seen anyone argue that personally. Private servers have known about leeway for years. All incorporate it.
---
Which is why it ‘basically didnt have pvp’ as pvp died and was unsupported
---
Now, I don't even want to hear that word with the hyper-polar rhetoric that's been flooding this sub for past couple days
---
On pserver there was an ally hunter who literally lived in hillsbrad killing horde all day every day lol.
---
Also was usually a rogue in horde inn, same area, camping all day.
---
Sometimes it would bring about pretty big pvp wars.
---
(pservers)
---
whoah in 8x Nefarian kills you got 3 Ashkandis and 2 Lok'Amirs? 
---
You guys had the loot gods with you.
---
:D
---
Oh my sweet summer child....bless your heart.
---
Yes it was in Vanilla, but the difference in ping / input lag is drastically different.
---
I actually had a mage in a BG deny me water unless I tipped him. If you demand tips for water/food in BGs or dungeons you are a real piece of shit.
---
Isn't leveling as tank pretty annoying? I'm currently testing a warrior on a private server, and i frankly don't how i should tank. Getting threat must be really annoying. Also you go in with a fury spec.
---
I don’t have the beta, but that’s very interesting. Is that true to vanilla or was that changed for wow classic I wonder?
---
No, they don't have a sense of humor. At least, the ones I've come in contact with. It's quite absurd that they are even allowed to be moderators, quite frankly.
---
Would there be any reason to attempt seal twisting or will the gains be miniscule?
---
* Rush to Feline Swiftness - my preference is via Brutal Impact, since I like to stealth pounce as my opener when I can
---
* Max Furor, so when you shift to cat you can Claw almost instantly
---
* Rush to Faerie Fire, picking talents benefiting Claw, as that's your primary dps
---
* Rush to Leader of the Pack
---
* Rush to Omen of Clarity
---
At level 56 you'll have a 11/31/5 build with 4 points left over. If you seem to be bear tanking dungeons, go Primal Fury, but if you're cat soloing, go Natural Shapeshifter.
---
Sounds like the shittiest experience ever.
---
You want to see a power trip? Check this out lmao https://i.imgur.com/KX8uvJI.png
---
Paladin is more than viable for dungeons. I don't get why people here think that they have issues generating threat, since righteous fury is an insane threat generator and you can easily hold a pack of mobs together when pairing it with consecration, which is unavoidable sustained spell damage threat goodness. I'd even argue that tanks such as warriors are more prone to dropping threat on large dungeon pulls, especially when stuff misses or gets parried, or when he finds himself having no rage. 
---
What paladins do struggle with is pulling. You need time to get your threat going, and for ranged pulls you need to rely on engineering or something. 
---
Also, consecration takes up a lot of mana so prepare to drink alot. Wont be that much of a problem since you can juggle seal of wisdom in bossfight. You'll definitely not be the fastest tank.
---
I feel like this should be higher
---
And taking it so seriously to boot
---
A sword is like a short staff with a pointy end.
---
Couldn't agree more. You articulated it really well
---
Why is streamable like a dialup internet simulator
---
Shaman does elemental damage, even slightly as a tank, so it would help with his threat.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c23tlc/i_spent_600_buying_old_pc_parts_to_benchmark_the/
---
I would be fine with expansions as long as they are separate servers. The main draw for me is the level cap.
---
Sure, fair enough
---
I played EQ2 on release for like 6 months before switching to WoW. I loved the art style much more than WoW's at the time myself. Cartoonish graphics like WoW or Borderlands have never really appealed to me much. 
---
What I liked about WoW over EQ2 was how much simpler it was. EQ2's heroic opportunity system was just not fun for me. The questing system was a lot harder to follow then WoW's. It was hard to find quests, and hard to find out where to go at certain lvls in EQ2. But In WoW they literally lead you by the nose all over Azeroth. All the quest givers have big ! over their head, and the directions were generally pretty obvious to follow.
---
Tradeskills in EQ2 had another stupid system that I cant really remember. But similar to the Heroic opportunities they just added extra steps to make it more complicated but it didn't really serve a purpose. Instead of making the grind a little more interactive and fun it made it unbearable for me.
---
Everquest 2 tried to reinvent Everquest when what they really needed to do was try and make it simpler to casual players could get into it. Don't complicate something just to try and create a game mechanic for players to interact with. That is hard to pull off without it feeling like a cheap gimmick. Especially when it is something you will be doing over and over. 
---
I was so hyped for EQ2 back in the day. About as hyped as I am now for Classic to come back. Unfortunatley EQ2 did not live up to that hype. Luckily I played Vanilla so I know I already love it, and it maeks the Hype all the more real.
---
that was not very nice of you
---
ooh, we finally found a benefit for layers, name hoarders can more easily hoard the popular names across all the realms
---
This particular mechanic was very well documented by private server developers trying to reverse engineer the game in the past, it's part of the spell batching system.
---
The server did most of it's spell processing in 400ms batches and buff/debuff applications were actually delayed, the spell cast would happen in one batch and the effects related to that spell would only happen on the next server batch.
---
You can easily see that in action whenever you watch a warlock dot someone, since dots have no travel time you can observe dots being applied only 400ms after the spell cast goes off.
---
As others have said, it used to be in the Blizzard gear store, I got one for my wife a few years back. Not sure if there’s a place to get them at this point short of eBay or something.
---
In my experience, the economy on Classic servers goes to hell after the server has been alive for 3+ years. Vanilla wasn't designed to run that long.
---
But yeah, that's an absurd amount. I had about 30k and was considered disgustingly rich.
---
Where do you hear they are needed? Nobody wanted to play with hunters in vanilla unless they had to. The class was super easy until 60 and a bit beyond, people that played it were often shit, especially alliance side with all the legolases
---
Hunter end game sets are so ugly, its not fair. Cryptstakler is cool but impossible to get for a player like me. Ill probably end up staying in Black Dragon Mail the whole time.
---
I tried rp-pve and when i flagged up nobody else was unless it was to 3v1 me.
---
I did my very first PvPing in Desolace.  Killed an orc warrior with my mage at around 32.
---
No he is not claiming it is try hard to pick one race over the other he is claiming it is try hard to pick a race over the other solely because of min/max.
---
It's almost like they could add more servers
---
One of the reasons I love PvP in Fellwood, I can kill someone, grind a bunch of mobs and then kill them again before the mobs repop.
---
The best of the best tournaments were amazing to experience though. 
---
https://youtu.be/Q5V71P2vFGQ
---
most of them yep
---
Hunter is king simply because of tracking. All wPvP groups need at least one hunter.
---
Lawbringer was changed in around 1.09 to remove dodge and block in favor of +heal
---
It might have been before 1.09. Seal of Fury was still a thing.
---
Someone posted the other day about how back in vanilla their guild would go an try intercept the other faction's guilds on Saturday nights on their way to raids to ruin their world buffs. They were reminiscing on this fondly.  
---
I really don't get it.
---
No rogue ability scales with Spell Power in the beta, that includes Poisons, as it should be.
---
Shadow Oil does scale with Spell Power in the beta, as it should be.
---
Shadow Oil did scale in Vanilla and does scale on the Beta.
---
The good thing about warriors is every group wants one. Even if they already have one they’ll take another. So if that’s what you want to play, then go for it.
---
Most warriors won’t be tanks, but yes, there are fewer tanks than any other role in the game, by a fair margin.
---
Please show me a compiler that compiles pseudocode.
---
When I was a kid I randomly stumbled upon the staff shop and was thrilled to see how everything looked on my character. Going back I could never find the shop, I spent so many hours until one day I learned you could hover over the signs. I was angry about that.
---
I think in the beginning there will be a lot of warriors but people will lose interest during the grind and re-roll something easier.
---
Upvoted. Everyone needs enemies!
---
In retail I would get it, in vanilla that's just dumb. It's not hard to do damage properly in vanilla, vanilla is all about helping the group complete the dungeon. Even after I muted him I used coe because it did seem to help the tank slightly and my loss in damage was replaced by his so I didn't care.
---
The PVP wars are great, though.
---
stay class....douchey!
---
Between 50s and 1g for a full tradewindow of water
---
It is deceptive. The thing is....
---
There are 3 cloth wearers. 3 leather wearers. 
---
Horde gets a 4th leather wearer... and alliance gets one plate wearer.
---
There is only one plate class in the entire game for horde, and 2 for alliance, that can even wear plate. ALL that plate needs a home.
---
There will probably be too many people that think they should be main tank of a raiding guild. But in dungeons, it's not like a warrior cannot dps for a druid tank, and you are not competing on the same gear. And barring a druid tank.... Someone has to tank the dungeons.
---
I honestly don't understand paladin gearing, but I wouldn't worry about that too much. A lot of them seem to like wearing cloth. They are into that kind of thing. 
---
Really, you have to look at the percentages. Sure, warrior is the most popular class. but it's usually under 20%. I would say horde can definitely support a population of 20% warriors.
---
Not to mention the staff size. Per Mike's interviews they had to cancel several other games to bring the teams working on those projects onto WoW to support its massive and unanticipated explosion.
---
Truth. When I started looking into classic I probably spent 1 week reading threads, checking wowhead classic, listening to some podcasts. Ive exhausted it pretty much everything I wanted to know and lost interest. Now I just check here a couple times a week and see the the same damn posts everyday.
---
If the name you use ingame is so common there is little to no notoriety to your character and if you are trying to save this many names im going to assume youre either planning to sell them later or are trying to claim a infamous name since you cannot build your own repuation without it.

We pugged a lot of mc/zig/aq and actually ran a suicide kings list for loot out of it so returning players got some benefit. We were pretty successful and near the end even got into BWL. There were usually ~20 guildies on alts or mains (if they missed main raid) 12-15 regular returners and 5 or so true pugs out of trade chat.

So i decided to dig through the vanilla wow binarys and it looks like the first instance of this code (referenced in the function Spell_C_GetMinMaxRange) was introduced in 1.10.0.5195.
---
prior to this there was no additional range given (at least in the client code).
---
for those who want to check themselves:
---
1.9.4.5086 (completely absent from this build)
---
&gt; 0x006C9840  Spell_C_GetMinMaxRange
---
1.10.0.5195 (first build i can find with the leeway code added)
---
&gt; 0x006D53C0  Spell_C_GetMinMaxRange
---
sigh........
---
it's true though, if there's only 10 realms and each realm has 5 layers you will only need 4 accounts to reserve your name on all of them.  if there were 50 realms you would need 20 accounts to reserve your name on all of them.
---
They actually did, then later they said *for sure by* phase 2. There's your range.
---
yes, roll a race you don't like the look of for an hour of raiding a week thats pathetically easy
---
This is crazy informative. I would love one for every dungeon.
---
I got there back in the day on a trial account with a modded file. It was something to do with changing where zeppelins transported you.
---
I mean I get your point.  I think because it's no longer 2006 it should go away or be ramped way the fuck back from where it's at on the beta.
---
no words...
---
&gt; I can\`t even comprehend as to why one thinks its ok to play on PVE server. 
---
Just read the thread replies? There's plenty of reasons. Feigning ignorance just makes you look dumb.
---
&gt; The entire point of online games is to bash eachothers skulls in. 
---
Well no, it's not. There's raiding, crafting, farming, dungeons, exploring, questing, collecting, role-playing, auction management, literally tons more things to do.
---
&gt; The thrill, the excitement 
---
In your opinion, which is fine, but what have you got against people who just want to play a damn video game however they like in a way which harms nothing but your apparent ego? What are you compensating for my dude?
---
this. OP is an idiot.
---
This is not in any way proof of anything but a slight leeway in the interface and ATTEMPTING to cast spells. This has NOTHING to do with whether those spellcasts/attacks actually resolve on the server.
---
&gt; Except if it doesn't you can just modify the client to do whatever the fuck you want. The piece of code you are modifying is just for the UI. Your explanation of why the client has this code is completely incorrect.
---
Most people won't modify the client to remove this check. Checking it clientside first means that the server only ever needs to run the check if you *are* in range -- but it still has to run the check in case people try to cheat by modifying the client. This is better than running the check every time someone tries to cast a spell while out of range, which happens often because players will spam the ability until it goes off.
---
&gt;Also "It would be slow and unecessary having the server manually check" is more wrong. Comparing two small numbers is the fastest thing a CPU can do and is completely necessary since every decision is on the server side.
---
It's an MMO. Little things add up. Plus computational effort isn't the only reason this is done: it also saves bandwidth. The server still checks, it's just that it doesn't need to check all the time when someone is spamming a spell while barely out of range.
---
I see the benefit of the 10% for sure. That's a noticeable decline, especially where chain ha is concerned.
---
But I'm certainly aware that shamans are going to do more than just chain heal, however, it is usually their intended role so I'm curious how devoted to that role I need to be with this hybrid.
---
???
---
*starts spamming rank 1 arcane explosion*
---
**Run away little girl** *run away*
---
look in the linked thread. the top comment claims it was based on time and not that it increased your range.
---
Nice
---
Yeah, where we had good luck... Had 3 thunderfury... we still had bad luck in others. I think we only had one deaths sting, one dark edge, and everyone that got a drake fang quit after a few weeks haha. Also had a resto druid try to take the drake fang and throw a fit that we wouldn't give it to them. Ah, vanilla drama!
---
More often than not server population will be skewed in favour of one faction meaning world pvp is nothing more than a gank-fest. There is no fight to be had.
---
I get that but occasionally their are rational people out there in the world... 
---
They can have a untouched classic server each expansion can have its own server. Their gameplay will not again I repeat not be touched.... but this is also the same community that rages over the idea of allowing orcs to be upright only on the individual players screen and no one else has to look at it, just because "its not what I want so no one can have it."
---
I thought that was the case. I knew you could on pservers but was pretty sure that was something not from Vanilla. Thanks mate.
---
I just wanted to add that you can easily tank or dps as fury dungeon, collecting loot for both roles. And then do either in raiding. Also, my guild use to run 3 prot and 6 fury warriors. That's almost 25% of the raid as warrior. Dont let a high warrior population daunt you - they are needed.
---
&gt;Damn it's almost like you're so blind with rage
---
Dudes comment history is some real incel shit
---
Warriors have a high burnout factor to because of their high gold costs of raiding for full consumes is so high generally warriors quit a lot. It is very rare to keep all 10-11 warriors in your raid team. 2-3 tanks and normally 8 fury warriors.
---
I came to that conclusion due to the client literally sending 0 packets to the server when you try to use a skill out of range.  
---
Like you said we can modify the client to remove the range restriction obviously, then the only thing stopping the attack would be the serverside check I mentioned above.
---
Your looking at it wrong, the circle and cross piece is the stave head  being thrust in a downward swing.
---
Naw. I'm with you man. You organically made new friends in Vanilla and BC. I've met a couple buddies through mythic + but we are all waiting until classic.
---
What does RP mean in the context of WoW servers? I know it stands for role-play, but I don't know what it means in practice. So as someone who has played lots of role playing games (pen &amp; paper and computer) but never played on a WoW RP server, what does it mean in this context? How is it different than other servers?
