Ever heard the phrase ironic shitposting is still shitposting? Same exact concept.

Congratz on your hard work paying off. I'm  jelly!
---
Lol the evolution of spellcleave right before our eyes.
---
Moonkin is a pvp spec in vanilla.
---
i kinda hit a slump at this point as well but stuck with SM until 38, then farmed stone elementals in the badlands for money until 40.
---
I'd say completely changing the fundamental way your game handles combat is much thicker of a rope than you percieve.  
---

---
I've gotten the feeling that the people arguing against my point in this thread dont understand the differences between rs3 and osrs.  While theres PLENTY, the major thing is the huge change to combat. It's not just them adding or removing skills and class mechanics or changing the focus of the game away from the leveling phase. I didnt go into a full explanation because I had hoped if people are going to give their opinion, theyd know about the two games. 
---
Osrs and rs3 are played completly differently and hit much different markets.  In a nutshell, that's why I think it shouldn't be used as a comparison of success for classic and retail.
---
Nah the nipple is for me, when I'm feeling extra pointy.

Dungeon spam

The same reason that the nicker is gone.
---
Do us all a favor and exit the human race.
---
Warlock.
---
More interesting class than mage IMO, don't have to constantly stop to drink, plenty of group utility (summon, soulstone, curses, banish/seduce, fear in PvP, etc).
---
Especially if playing horde since you won't have to deal with Will of The Forsaken breaking your fears
---
Which class are you and what outfit is your character wearing.
---
Really helps to 'fear juggle' hard mobs such as elites. Dot em up, fear em when they close, just before they get out of range/pull other mobs hit em with the CoR. Right before they get back to you, put another curse on them and the fear starts up again (CoR doesn't remove a fear that's already on, it just makes them ignore it)
---
Honestly, if you're in a guild, and they're cool, get some people and do some farming runs. You guys just run it over and over until everyone gets what they want. If you get it, you still stay in the group and help them and they have one less person to compete against. I did this with a random group and we farmed RFK like 12 times for the first two bosses to get everyone who wanted this ridiculous axe (me, another shaman, and DPS warrior and the tank warrior). We stuck around and made sure everyone got theirs. We sweetened the deal for our priest healer by giving him all our cloth drops.
---
I guess that is cool. If it works for you it works for you; but I would recommend experimenting, especially once you get some +(shadow)damage gear.
---
It's taking me hours between levels. Is this normal?
---
You do come off as a bit of a jerk. I understand what you're getting at though, it's the reason I don't browse the FrontPage comments. It's not even like the phrases are funny on their own, let alone when it's the millionth time they've been mindlessly slapped onto some barely relevant content. It actually baffles me that people will go out of their way to type it and then others will vote it up.
---
In my old guild we called it the condom and it goes on the tank because the tank is there for your protection.
---
I think you just pick them up - iirc (if i recall correctly) i just asked in general/guild chat.
---
FYI
---
- BIS: Best in slot
---
- WC: Wailing Caverns (a dungeon)
---
- DM: Deadmines (if it's a lowbie) Dire Maul (if it's a high lvl) [in general]
---
- SM: Scarlet Monastery (Dungeon). This has 4 wings (GY-Graveyard, Lib-Library, and others
---
All (?) dungeons have their own acronym. 
---
idk if there's a guide though
---
What are your goals? Are you trying to level as quickly as possible? Do you want some mad PvP action with a side of questing? Do you want to explore the world at your own rate doing quests where you find them?
---
Thanks man
---
All hail Scribler
---
I don't mind bringing a rogue in my zf runs. They are great in killing runners, totems and stopping casters. As a warrior it's kinda irritating to stop spinning to pummel. Intercept or focus the totems.
---
You clearly don't understand. Mage is plenty of money, but hunter can make a lot of money doing other things as well. Hunters can do the Rhok'delar quest for other hunters. You can make upwards of 250g~ just doing a short fight for someone else. Hunter will also be able to farm DM tribute runs when P2 releases, resulting in 50-100g per item you sell to other players. You can already do that by selling items in Mara but they are far less lucrative.
---
Mages are way better at AOE farming, but you'll make far more money having access to both a Mage and a Hunter, as well as a few other classes. Mage isn't the supreme at making gold, retard.
---
You should show.what the sunder armor debuff looks like, not sure if big dick dps can interpret what it is.
---
Yep if you get in a good SM Armory/Cath run it’ll speed it up a lot
---
It's surprsingly easy to get there once you get past all the high level elities in darkwhisper gorge. Theres only spot where you need to get stuck and then you jump and the rest is easy jumping from platform to platform and then falling into hyjal.
---
Thanks for the indepth answer pal. I appreciare it.
---
Congrats. I'm 27g away myself.
---
Players have been saying this for years and it still hasn't been implemented. Blizzard just stick to their bullshit line that the servers are balanced when a cursory scan of the respective AH will show you that one faction has almost 4 - 6x the number of total listings as the other.
---
Either do guild runs or runs where you are the leader and you set the loot threshold to rare/epic 
---
If you do the latter in a pug, explain it chat or before you run what the loot rule/s are.

Fury does straight more dmg? I have Dreadforge Retaliator for arms atm. For fury i would have Thrash Blade and Flurry Axe. And i heard arms is way better for pvp. Is it realy such a big matter? I would hate to loose against everyone who attacks me, just because i picked fury :D
---
You can say whatever you want but I have no respect for aoe grinding mages that kill named quest mobs in their aoe pulls . If I see one aoe grinding I as hunter will always run through the aoe with my mobs , make the slow fall out and feign death in the opposite direction of the aoe mass 
---
. Then I watch the idiot mage scramble for his life and usually die.
---
If opposite faction , rest assured a viper sting has your name on it
---
But who do I cast Banish on?
---
He must have had a skin graft.
---
I have always ramped my dps and I don’t get why people don’t do that anymore.
---
Moon is sap and always will be
---
No. Stoneform only deal with poison, bleed, and disease. FF is a magic effect and is not affected.
---
Saying this to a healer is just funny.
---
I didnt mean it like that. I started in TBC and enjoyed it as well as WOTLK but the reason I came in was due to vanilla success pulling alot of friends into the game who also pulled me in. In my opinion tho the things that people say they wanted for balance and convenience ended up ruining the game in the long run because it sapped out the flavor and uniqueness.  Again just my opinion but if they rerelease TBC im defintely out and have no desire to go down that road again with dead cities and little to no player interaction in world.
---
As far as I can tell paladin threat is way better than warrior's
---
Anime called Sword Art Online (Netflix) 
---
Basically play WoW you enter the game via headgear, but everyone gets trapped. If you die in game you die IRL.
---
Best level/race/class to twink at?
---
I played back in the day and had a 19 twink rogue and a 29 hunter, I enjoyed both, but wanted people opinions over all, my class knowledge is massively lacking and I only did pvp with level 60 mage and the two twinks
---
TIA!
---
Or you could just call out like a normal human being instead of expecting some picture on the internet to help you with your social anxiety.
---
Oooooo I'll have to check that out thanks man.
---
Maybe it's lucrative at higher levels?
---
&gt; Meta doesn’t matter in Classic.
---
That's the dumbest shit I've read in a while, what makes you make such a stupid assertion?
---
First the Blackrock Slicer, now this?!
---
Get ranged weapon skill, a shield, first aid and an ample supply of potions and you are good
---
What I take issue with is your use of reasonable. Not everyone is like you, most people are probably vastly different, live and let live ya? Have a good day
---
He's in Booty Bay i think
---
We needed this!
---
Everyone thank Blizzard for allowing unrestricted alliance transfers off an already imbalanced server.

Get ready for a miserable P3 and on horde.

I'm skinner tailor and I vendor all my leather. Once you're higher and start to get thick/rugged leather the money is worth it. I can't be bothered to auction all my stacks, lose money putting the auction up and not selling.
---
Arms.
---
If you want to respec a couple times you can finesse the build a lot more to suit different level ranges but you want a few points in deflection, improved rend and max out tactical mastery immediately.
---
And that's your tanking talents basically. The rest is up to you. You probably want improved charge and overpower early over improved rend, deep wounds and impale.
---
If you don't want to respec though, you might want to plan out more carefully how many points you're going to put in by 40.
---
If you can skip improved rend entirely, you can max out deflection.
---
Seriously, I don't think I could stand a warlock without first aid. Its so damn useful.
---
Sun(circle)=tank    moon=healer
---
Pretty sure Warriors are by far the slowest leveling class solo.
---
Square has definitely been the 3rd most consistent mark I've seen. Trap for life.
---
Just curious, what does that actually mean? What were you don'doing wrong?
---
You were lucky to be in int gear when he attacked. In feral gear you would have been oom after half of that, haha.

*Thrall will remember that.*
---
I find that the sound of my massive dong dragging around while I sneak naked draws too much attention.
---
I have the same problem and have to constantly search on a second monitor.  Wowhead seems like a good resource.
---
Unpopular Opinion: I have a mage and I hate AOE grinding; I'd rather quest and enjoy myself.
---
There's a classic version of LittleBuddha that does this.
---
you can install elvui to get your fps and ms (lag) for a realm
---
then ask in general chat what time server do guilds raid.
---
it will at least give you a general idea, and then find a guild on that server roll a char on it and join them and then login when you plan to raid to ensure that they raid at those times.
---
you can/should know this before rolling on the realm though
---
Dunno I remember from prebis scholo farming runs that shakle target always was star, I guess it varied from server to server.
---
dungeon wise you wouldn't make people rage, there's plenty still leveling that also have no idea what their doing, just be upfront about it.
---
Raid wise though if your serious your going to want to hit up guides and learn it before you go.
---
right now I've got a warrior @ 60, and a shaman at 54. Warrior's /played was already 2 days less than shammy's /played. Also warrior was significantly cheaper due to only having to buy food.
---
Professions in mind. You're thinking that combo due to monitary benefit?
---
Wait, are they not removing layering?
---
A soul(fire) for a soul(shard).
---
I'm not sure. 25g/hr seems decent for a rogue to me when it's mindless so you can be doing other stuff while you do it. I've been watching shows or listening to podcasts while I do it if I get tired of running dungeons.
---
Yo sorry for making you so upset with my food for thought. From all the comments prior to this, I had already gathered my idea was a poor one. Sorry again for upsetting you so much.
---
Sheep the feared guy right?
---
Newman!
---
You just made warcraft meme history with that icon. good job. 10/10
---
Something need doing?
---
You are a petty person
---
Good job buddy.  Try to make some friends in game, it’s a lot more fun that way. Join a small guild in game or after a good dungeon run ask the players you got along with if you can friend then and then ask them to run with you again.
---
Stay at range where you're less likely to pull aggro. If you do get aggro run TOWARDS the tank not away, once the tank has the mob back then go back to range.
---
I found the 50% of warriors that I was talking about. lmao if you think low damage dots on offtargets and focusing the skull is BAD ENTITLED DPS WHO SHOULD DO NOTHING BUT WAND AFTER WAITING FOR 15 SUNDERS
---
Seems to be something in my eye...
---
And then I ask you to take star off me because I absolutely hate when people do that.
---
&gt;"Either someone who typically likes ego-tripping will religiously tell you which way to go and everything to do."

I feel personally attacked
---
The green is banish cuz shit turn green when u banish it yo
---
I'll take a look.
---
Uh, my 41 mage has full +frost dmg/spell dmg gear and his frostbolts get at least +55% dmg. It is not useless, at least for PvE.
---
The worst part is when a mob gets out of cc early, so you desperately try to polymorph it, but then you see a rogue poison pop up on its debuffs.
---
Well like I posted above, shoot me the minidump file in your windows folder (google how to make it create minidumps) and I can possibly offer some better insight.
---
Oh noggenfoggers!
---
&gt; I've been making my own groups lately with the intent of doing it the "classic" way. 
---
Same. The wipes are just wasting everyones time.
---
Become a firefighter in a department that works 24 on 72 off and you won’t have this issue :) best job for a gamer
---
i bought my boyfriend the new zelda game and it seems to be working
---
Which one for banish target :(
---
It seems to me a lot of people talking about how easy it is to make gold probably got lucky with drops. I didn’t get a single blue boe til lvl 50 (and an epic boe shortly after that) so I was scraping together gold til about 42. After 40 it gets way easier to make gold so if you don’t have it by 40 you’ll probably have it within a level or two. Hope that helps!
---
Until you accidently turn off numlock and cant figure out why it wont mark on first pull ;)
---
Herod isn't much better. It has a similar distribution to Skeram, but a higher population. All of the Alliance players are sitting in dungeons farming gear/gold while the Horde players infest the world. It's pretty much impossible to do anything in the world. MC and Ony are a pushover so losing world buffs isn't too bad, but later on we're going to have to use invis pots just to get to the raid safely with our world buffs. World bosses will basically be impossible In P2 due to the imbalance. Flight paths will be camped worse than they already are and the Alliance population will shrink even further. It's pretty miserable to be Alliance on these servers and it's not going to get any better.
---
The power leap dude. Quest greens that out-stat T3 epic sets.
---
Maybe in raids, not dungeons.
---
Full affliction at least till you get siphon life, then probably into demo for some improvements to void walker.
---
It's been a long time but I remember managing mana by basically using spirit tap whenever siphon life would tick you beyond full and wanding the one you're tanking when you don't need drain up.
---
I wouldn't running around doing this 24/7 it's less efficient than just fear juggling a couple, my comment was about an example of how you might break a camp safely, something most classes can't do on their own.
---
There's also 3 day timers for the 20man raids.
---
Yes, the trinket should help against warlocks. You have the right idea. 
---
That sounds about right. Warriors are pretty gear dependant and if they have a good weapon it's big. I'm sure that's the way the cookie usually crumbles unless you fight unskilled and/or trash geared warriors. I didn't mention crippling poison but you use it for everything in pvp anyways afaik. I think you really have to go tryhard mode to win against a decent warrior.
---
If the hunter opens, as I mentioned, use sprint and bombs. If you have poison dot you can still vanish and quickly stun them afaik. Not sure if that works with mark on you...probably. I don't think running away helps unless you blind him, stun his pet and sprint away and pray he doesn't mark you and track humanoids/detect stealth while aspecting/mounting up to catch up on you. And your gnome racial helps, true.
---
As a rogue you can usually pick and choose your fights and get the jump so that's a big advantage. Just doing PVP and learning from mistakes will help you too.
---
I mained a rogue in vanilla but honestly had not much of a clue what works best etc. I also played another one in later expansions doing some twink pvp. I'm no expert but I gathered a few hings from experience and the community. I'm glad to give feedback and hopes it helps. I'm sure there is much more advice out there, hope you find it.
---
Porque no los dos? Gotta love the entendres
---
Where are there stairs in Shimmering Flats? Im calling fake news
---
I’m on the horde side
---
&gt;classic+ is 100% the correct play if they want to keep people
---
I'm glad we have you to tell us the correct way to play the game
---
Mind me asking where to farm?
---
Unless you have a tease and denial fetish.
---
lol First of many for me i'm sure, now I just hunker down deep in the boat if there is a priest aboard.
---
Hello fellow hunter.
---
Yeah! Benediction sucks! Every stay away! You will be camped for hours on end!
---
They are making a vr game for SAO hopefully no one gets trapped in.
---
I skipped Hellfire at Outlands release because it was too packed. I just enjoyed grinding mobs in Zangar alone because it was exciting to get any green drops because they were so good. I hit 61 before anyone even got to Zangar, and then I could do the quests.
---
It’s just my opinion, relax before you hurt yourself
---
That was actually my go to too in ubrs, star was poly moon sap. But i never expected them to know, i always explain before first pull
---
That got me weirdly emotional.
---
&gt;0.016%
---
Also the chance of either one dropping in my runs
---
I’m on the horde side, my guys name is jaccer
---
I had a tank leave group and gquit because I stunned an enemy. He got pissed because “if you’re just gonna stun then why even have a tank, dick”
---
It’s just my opinion... relax before you hurt yourself
---
Wait. The moon is NOT for “no pants”??
---
Insolvency of churches.  Good one.
---
thank you
---
Follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHJF2eSOo7I) .You can kite him around the pillar till about 40 percent, then he moves faster I think. You have to be ahead of him but not too far because he will reset health. Once you get him to 40 percent just fight him. You should be fine.
---
The fact that the game got to a point where this is no longer common knowledge is sad...
---
Well said.
---
Thank you for this. After a priest shackled Skull in stead of Star during a Strat run then blamed us for breaking CC this is needed now more than ever.
---
can someone explain what happens? i only get 3G  in the toilet at work
---
What's this obsession with efficiency that I'm seeing everywhere? There's nothing wrong with playing a normal tank and spank, not everyone is rushing to 60.
---
&gt;TBC introduced us to Daily Quests and gated progression. TBC is the start of a shift towards designing gameplay to dangle carrots so subscribers stay subscribed.
---
Lmao as if raid lockouts and phases isnt gated progression.
---
honestly, yes. but maybe at like level 54 after you clear ungoro crater and hinterlands, both of which are great exp zones.
---
I healed brd and lbrs as shadow and finally switched to holy at 58 and which I had done so earlier. You are going to be in BRD, LBRS, UBRS, scholo, and strat  for a lonnnnnnnng time hunting bis pieces, holy/disc makes that experience more enjoyable.
---
It really makes a big difference but it's not impossible to heal as shadow by any means.
---
I mean ok but everything other than skull/X/moon are pretty interchangeable.
---
I am so tired of seeing the word spell cleave. Its AoE god dammit! Idc if I'm old
---
Yep
---
I’d love to see “big dick dps” used in more history books.
---
Big dick pulls and big dick dps only pls; followed by big dick heals of course
---
I feel you brother. I'm back on the pipe and hitting it hard. There is NOTHING I wouldn't do to get my hands on another rock. Nothing matters, just the deep chemical inhale of WOW. Come to think of it... an actual crack habit would help me sleep less and play longer. Oh god who are those children tapping at the basement door? BEGONE SPAWNS!
---
I say, don't worry about them. I did get abandoned once in WC due to subpar tank skills at the time; a super dick move. And the. I had others trying to tell me to stick to x or y stance, x or y combo. Its cool to give recommendations, but if I'm pulling mobs, and you are not dying how bout you stfu. The worst was one that told me, stick to defensive and use thunder clap. Lol. Im not experienced at all in the game, but warriors get fun. My first character was a hunter on the allied said, and I enjoyed playing that one a lot. Only reason I changed sides was to play with a friend.
---
&gt;People don't like the attitude that it's okay to police what others enjoy
---
That's funny because the people complaining about political correctness and SJWs are trying to do exactly that.
---
Sure does !
---
F
---
Ignites *
---
Scribler is a perfect gnome name
---
Or maybe the person was proud of their accomplishment/commemoration wanted to share it with a community who would understand why a character in a game would be important to them.
---
Reading this whole thread and man you got an attitude and/or superiority complex you gotta clean up.
---
Hey I remember trying to get these back in vanilla on my warrior. I lost every roll after like 50 runs I never got a single one.
---
^ this. Couldn’t have said it better myself
---
Do both! While waiting for a group, do quests! :)
---
Lmao they were on a different layer, how could they stand a chance when they couldn't even see you lmfao
---
Stop upvoting lul
---
Can some mod delete this actually
---
Been doing the Pyromancer runs the last 2 days and pickpocketing my way out of the dungeon. 30+ runs and only one drop so far. Think im gonna give up and go try brd lol
---
I actually agree with this, at least for the first half of leveling in my case. I stacked spirit until around level 40 and then started switching toward +shadow dmg and stam, but stacking spirit during the first half was definitely nice. I think at some point, though, killing things faster &gt; having faster regen, but I could be totally wrong as I switched half way.
---
Hey, I'm a Paladin tank and I agree with everything you've written. I don't have experience with proper spellcleave but your comments on communication, banter, and helping friends really parallel my time leveling.
---
Cheers.
---
Good history lesson: now do cata and mop :p
---
Great, thank you!
---
I use addblock, just not on YouTube tho, it's to support the content creaters I watch, they get revenues from me watching adds on their videos.
---
Shouldn’t the moon equal hibernate?
---
Wait... which is the original? The shorts or the short shorts?
---
Great, thanks a lot!
---
Why does looting a corpse not give u the same stuff that pickpocketing would
---
Improved drain soul is absolute garbage I've found, it was never used in vanilla and is such a waste of two points.
---
Make sure to spam that drain soul while the soulfire travels to the target!
---
Eh, Star is sap not circle.
---
That’s the best part imo.  Maybe you gather them all yourself, you could get lucky and get everything you need in a few kills.  Or maybe a rare/epic item drops and you sell it for more gold than you need to buy the materials.  You might even gather so many other materials you aren’t even looking for that you can sell them for the money to buy the items you actually need.
---
Repeating of course
---
Where's the mind control icon?
---
We just always let the CCer pick their symbol and mark their own targets. Other than skull and x it didn't matter what was what as long as you knew your cc target.
---
I was fond of circle for shackle.
---
You seem to be correct according to databases and my obersvatiins are in line with yours as well.
---
Honestly it's easier to just farm gold and buy it. Recipe on my server goes for 230g.
---
Gfdi
---
Sang’thraze dropped for our group once.
---
Man if your friend is considering suicide because he died a couple times in a video game you should probably both genuinely consider a move to a PVE server. Like how many more times is that going to happen?
---
Not a con, people knew exactly what they were buying
---
Also not defending her, just making sure that people are honest and logically consistent. I see you like to shame trans people, so at least you're consistent about being a basic puritanical douche.
---
[removed]
---
Best one I’ve seen yet
---
I have gone to the middle of nowhere trying to see if I can make AE farming work. Even then, there’s someone already there trying it. 
---
Recently the people AE farming POI’s are guarded by a 60 rogue etc so then it just turns into a kill/res fest which accomplishes nothing.
---
That's so fucking awesome that this is possible, just makes you feel good to see something like this :)
---
Depends on the encounter. If it's important to stack somewhere for instance, you'll usually mark a player.
---
How does the AH market behave for a rare drop like Dark Whelpling? I randomly got one and it sells for like 25 gold right now, but I also wouldn't mind keeping it so I'm curious if it'll majorly decrease in value or stay where it is. I would imagine as time goes on, they decrease in value but I don't want to assume anything.
---
You sound like an idiot...  LOL
---
You mean SS, SnD, Kick, and then 9 bindings of Vanish!
---
Its easier to fear the mob so they run into more mob with causes more mob to attack the mage.
---
Isn't that technically r/Christianity
---
How dare those strangers not pay enough attention to you!
---
Lmao, pray they go down. If a rogue targets a creature, they die. It's like drawing a sword, the intent is to delete. And PSHAW, vanish is always ready just in case it was somebody elses fault my mobs didn't die. Puhlease.
---
This is where alliance and a big f u to horde by buying the mats and vendoring then instead of turning them in.
---
Oh you mean the horde pve server? Lmao when you don't have a faction to compete against, you start competing against your own.
---
The time between levels increases significantly as you go. it depends on your server (PVP vs PVE) and its pop. Doing some quests where the drop rate is low is a total pain when the pop is high because everyone is murdering all the things you need. You spend a lot of time not doing anything but running around trying to find something to kill. On a high pop PVP server, add the fact that you're fighting other faction players too. 
---
In this situation doing dungeons gets you a lot more XP/unit time. But it's all about what you like. Do you have any interest in the story? Do you like smiting someone who was desperately trying to get a hit on a mithril vein?
---
Because I made it. Also it's stupid. People like stupid.
---
Another example of gamer oppression. SMH my head
---
&gt; in the early days of League of Legends 
---
It was in *any online game.* Ragnarok Online brazillian's servers were full of players who generated the same negative stereotype. Gunbound, Counter-Strike, even goddamn Starcraft and Dota.
---
It's this weird cultural thing were some players completely disregard cooperation in favor of gaining advantages, because otherwise you are a "schmuck".
---
Luckly it has diminished - better english education to help with communication, more time in the internet to integrate... but the stereotype lasts.
---
Thanks for the reply. I'm assuming you mean the font size in the chatbox, however that's only changes the font size of the written text in the chatbox.
---
I think shadow priests are a lot worse than just 'off meta'.
---
They literally can't do anything. They can't use their main skill because of the debuff limit and they run oom incredibly fast.
---
The only thing you are potentially there for is the shadow damage debuff when locks start to get op, but even that is better off done with a holy priest weaving in shadow spells.
---
Lmao they're not gonna nerf this. Furthermore, sodapoppin did it repeatedly streaming to 20,000 viewers for like 6hours
---
Yeah, the reason why I mention it is because I've used both methods. The traditional VW tank and now the Succubus DL spec (Not lvl 40 yet though) Anyway, my understanding was that you're not supposed to use fear from an efficiency pov. I guess when I can use the Succi as a mana battery it'll be different. Looking at both methods I don't think the VW is a bad levelling pet at all, unless you are going at it hardcore I'd say either method is as good as the other.
---
It's obviously not viable for any kind of leveled instance but mostly a lot of fun to play around with. We have found other useful strats for VW like offtanking some nasty adds (dark iron dwarfs in Gnomer with the bombs)

You need a hug...
---
I am currently level 40 horde hunter, taking my time leveling. I am wondering what I can do, dg and quest wise, whilst leveling, to prepare for post 60 pre raid bis whilst leveling.
---
Multi-shot the Polymorphed target and the Sapped target along with the one the rest of the party is fighting.
---
If you have the mob alive to use SnD then you're doing it wrong!
---
Not the world, just the US.
---
Well they are probably aoe farming? You dont do that in group outside dungeons... Except with a healer maybe.
---
lol, technical? "i'm so scared to make the wrong choice and have less potential fun"
---
If I'm misinformed, so is WoWhead. That's where I got every bit of this.
---
Lost the pages in STV.
---
Entitled players like you make me side with the mage. They don't have to buff you and give you water, get over it.
---
If locks could aoe grind you would do it too, they're not jerks for just trying to grind.
---
I just finished up Flatts last week and remarked how her shorts were long for being Daisy Duke. Maybe they patched it?
---
Okay. But I've leveled both to 60, Warriors only have to buy food, not food and water. They have no mana dependant buffs, their gear is strictly based on one set, they can tank all dungeons easily(which leads to vastly increased exp/hr). There are a lot of plus sides to warriors, they do tremendous DPS as well. There is a reason shaman are the least played class. You think playing a warrior is boring? At least try playing a shaman before you go on about how hard warriors are, I promise you, shaman are by far more boring, more expensive, MORE gear dependant, and slower. Warriors might be last in leveling speed, based purely on grinding/questing. But shaman are ranked 2nd to last, are significantly more expensive, have to carry two sets of gear, need water and food, and have the same DPS. The only difference is shaman can kill equal level opponents for grinding, where as warriors can only kill 1-2 levels below. PS: Past lvl 42, shamans do about half the DPS a warrior will properly geared.

Yeah coloring was fed rushed, mid patient drawings lol colors are from highlighters red pen and a gold marker someone used to keep for x-day films

What determines whether I have to queue up again? My sound/audio turned off in-game and I don’t want to crash the game and have to sit through queue again. I’ll often get disconnected and kicked off, but I rarely have to get back into queue. 
---
So what are my options? I need to reboot the game, but I don’t want to requeue. 
---
Any way to fix sound issues in-game? I didn’t have sound on the queue and loading screen either
---
those fucking stone elementals took me 3 days. around about 10 hours if you were to count them respawning. i will never forget the transgressions of those elementals and their refusal to break off chunks of their body to provide me with a stopwatch
---
This is a really fkn cool video. Go Brad!!! :)
---
I tank mostly in PUGs. I'd say 1/3 DPS are just fortnite kids mashing buttons. Another 1/3 are asshole mages that think we are in an aoe farm, and the last 1/3 are decent DPS.
---
You will always make money off of skinning. As example go farm devilsaur hide.

Heh, just noticed that.

Or don't enable cross realm battlegrounds. That was a huge incentive back in vanilla, if your server was dominated by the opposite faction it meant you had instant battlegrounds queues. Serious pvpers preferred to be on the smaller faction side, which helped balance servers.
---
Hahah everybody forgot about these icons because you dont need to ever use them in retail wow because of how easy it is xD

That’s awesome man, I’m sure your friend would have loved this.

On a separate note, do you click blink?

Of course not, the balance is shit and most game design decisions are awful.

I'd wager most people are waiting for BC and eventually wrath for the actual good games.

DAE cuttin onions?! It’s cringe and embarrassing, I agree.

It’s just another overused ‘reddism’ phrase people parrot because they’ve seen it on literally every single emotional post, and it always generates easy upvotes. If you call it out you get the “why are you so angry!” comments. 
---
Maybe someday y’all can learn to express your emotions like adults.
---
Because mythics are almost identical to Diablo portal runs.
---
Yeah its so social spamming lfg lmao.
---
That is considered griefing and was also against the rules back in vanilla. Inconveniencing your side seems to slip under the radar, but getting them killed intentionally not so much.
---
You can get reported and probably a couple day ban if you get caught with enough evidence.
---
Ha, forgot to change my flair. Leveling a priest now.

It’s sexist if someone named daisy duke wears a popular article of clothing in real life nick named daisy dukes? You are the problem.

What's got me is op's stance on internet... it's so important. Some people consider it to be a basic human right to information, almost on par with food/water/shelter/love.
---
I mean... shouldn't the colours correspond with the class that has the CC? 
---
Triangle = Hunter trap
---
Square = Polymorph
---
etc
---
Ty for the reply, I'm suck using a keyboard atm unfortunately.
---
One of my flat mates is like this. I have never seen such a 180 switch in personality as when her boy friend is visiting. Poor bastard.

T3 was the power leap, and was on par with SSC gear IIRC.
---
You might have accidentally pressed ctrl s? Did you check the system settings to see if sound is unchecked?
---
Shit dude, do you play professionally? You sound so good at this game.
---
I really love drain tanking with a succubus, also because quest mobs are usually killed more by the large pop its easier to fear+dot multiple targets without the risk of pulling additional packs.
---
Wash yer back!
---
If you add pvp and people questing yes,you won't be able to pull as many mob as you should on paper, plus you might have to wait for the respawn
---
If you're PUGging then only skull is reliable, with X being about 50-50 on reliability. Anything else you should really say explicitly. I personally have a macro when I'm marking targets that goes something along the lines of "/p {skull} kill first, {x} kill second, {square} cc/interrupt"  
---
If you're not in a PUG then obviously you can set up whatever cryptic rules you want, although I personally just stick to the same rules and expect the people carrying the CC to talk about it before hand.
---
10k people could easily keep classic afloat if they are paying 15/month.

---
Welcome to social games. People want you to care about others, *pause for gasp*, and will try to enforce this behaviour. "Fuck off leave me alone while I'm inconveniencing you because my class is better" is for MSO's like retail.
---
That said, I don't approve of griefing. I do very much approve social pressure against that though.
---
No I'm just not braindead and can press more than a couple of buttons at a time. Sorry if I offended you.
---
New tank here, which stance do you do when you're "2h cleave tanking"
---
I literally just made a macro to spam for groups because as a hunter having your MT make sheep targets the blue square is infuriating.
---
Green triangle is also banish
---
Man fuck blizzard. But for other reasons too.
---
I have seen you 😀
---
I always want to be the nipple.

Yeah I keep it about as low as I can. It’ll only be for sone grinding etc. probably max out fishing or something

This isn't your personal blog, go make a myspace account or something.

---
As a healer, I only ever mark the tank when we're running comps like 3 warr (1 tank, 2 dps) and I want to be able to tell which one is the main tank from a glance. Sure, I could probably heal about as well without the marking, but it saves me some hassle in times that require quick thinking
---
Mouseover macro and not healbot or whatever nub crutch, btw
---
Missed the point

In Soviet Russia, Moon sheeps you...

You're the one going around telling others their opinion is subjective while claiming yours is 100%. Maybe you're the one who's hurt
---
I wanted my weapon to glow. I saw red everywhere, and found out it was beast slayer. So I eventually found an enchanter. I asked what other colors he could do. He said blue, green, yellow, rainbow..... 
---
I put my item I wanted enchanted in the actual trade window AND the silver. He took both.
---
Rainbow...........
---
No, but he would hurts GOLLUM.
---
yes sure, in wow you there are currently 2 places that you need "attunement" to get inside - molten core and onyxia's lair - level 60 raids.  In WoW attunement is just a posh way of saying "you are allowed in".     so you complete a series of quests to be allowed in. hope that makes some kind of sense
---
There are people here making serious comments complaining about political correctness ruining things.

I use it for mana regen to limit downtime. It’s not much but still helps. Like I said it’s all preference. What spec are you?
---
Fuck you. Gimme your swords, OP!!!
---
Didn't say I need something. Just trying to help you see that your AoE grinding inconveniences other people, so I'll inconvenience you
---
The only data available to us doesn’t show any PvP servers with 80/20 imbalance.  Even on a 50/50 server you are going to find imbalanced areas sometimes.
---
That would be nice
---
Efficiency can lead to a faster 60, but efficiency for itself can be a gratifying thing. Some people prefer to be efficient. It can feel good to do a clean, crisp run. Doesn't mean necessarily they're rushing to 60 my dude.
---
There's also nothing wrong with obsessing over efficiency, which is what I think you're implying, equally as much as there is nothing wrong with normal tank and spank.
---
Well you're one hell of a mad one 🙂 maybe you should reroll to mage?
---
What's up SLAPPERS?
---
Holy priests can only really weave in blasts which is a good way to grab threat off the tanks, so not really, better off with smiting if you can afford it. But typically you wand weave. You’d be surprised how much casters will weave in wanding to manage their mana.
---
Same with shadow, especially if you can get a slot for swp.

Just flay and wand. XD

Vanilla WoW is what brought me and my step dad closer. argued constantly before we finally had something in common. I recreated his Warlock today. I definitely understand where you're coming from and I'm sorry about your loss.

I had a tank get mad call me a noob and leave the party because I asked him why he was marking the targets he didn't want us to attack with a skull.
---
Lol that's most players really the Alliance dont the exact same thing when they have the opp.
---
I swear I’m mostly being a sarcastic asshole here!

But...

Requesting accommodations and playing without a raid bucket is *NOT* the Vanilla experience I remember! Who needs sleep anyway. I say raid. Raid the fuck out of it until your jobless and the neighbours are genuinely concerned about your well being.

Ty!

Mind soothe is super underrated.
---
*cough* Faerie Fire (Feral) *cough*
---
Or just be in caster form and pull with Wrath or regular FF. That's what I do when I have to tank instead of heal.
---
This is correct. You could also say it like feral-ass. 
---
Presumably the feral part of feralas is pronounced as feral.
---

I have blink bound to the ` key, just to the left of the 1 key

I don’t think he meant it that way... more like wearing short shorts attracted men which can lead to becoming a mom.

I have a feeling everyone in the 10-19 arenas will be twinks.  If everyone is a twink no one will be lol
---
You didn't offend me, it's just no one really gives a shit how good you think you are.
---
Why would the winning side need to be salty?
---
Not to mention disrespectful. Can you imagine telling folks that a loved one died and then some moron starts being all meme-y saying "DAE onions right in the feels"?
---
You're the only jerk in the scenario you painted.
---
Spirit tap will take care of any mana issues while you level, I levelled as a drain tank until 45, then swapped to soul link because I'm in a pvp realm and being ganked considerably slows my levelling time, so I take the damage loss for the strongest spec in the game for incredible survivability.
---
Mmmmmm, sap that nipple!
---
Holy shit guys stop killing this guy he is obviously not joking around.
---
Roll a pve server if that fucks you up bad enough to whine to reddit about it. Otherwise nut up and shut up.
---
Just a quick note, 2H is gonna do a lot more damage if you have a shaman to give you windfury
---
Nerd rage alert
---
To be fair, most of those things just aren't worth using at low levels. When leveling as combat early on, you just have such shitty energy management that it really isn't ever worth using anything other than Sinister Strike, Evis, or SnD. Sure, you could gouge, but its using up like 50% of your energy, then what? You dont need to get behind the druid because you're using swords. If you use a Kidney, you won't be able to cast a SS at all during the duration of the stun. Most rogues don't even train/ use crippling poison while leveling. Why have to swap between crippling and instant poison everytime you want to fight the other faction? All in all, rogues just aren't very good in PvP while leveling up and using Combat.
---
It sounds like people laugh because it would be an absurd thing to be upset about, then comment on a real issue since they are similar subjects.
---
I think you totally misunderstood what I was saying.
---
In raids, you can't mind flay and you can't cast swp because of the debuff limit. You are effectively neutered dps wise.
---
The only thing you can do is keep up a debuff that increases shadow damage so the locks get a dps increase. This function is better served by a specially specced holy priest that can also heal.
---
If it makes you feel better almost all horde suck on bigglesworth.   Never lose a 1v1 to the trash players.  They only have a chance when they outnumber you 3v1 or are much higher level. I’m assuming most quit in phase 2 and they have to fight more even fights.   
---
Stay in there.
---
In other words, RUN TOWARDS THE DAMN TANK
---
Wow thanks for the gold homie!  I didn’t know everyone else felt as strong about this as I do!
---
Square is for the tank
---
Is this not well-known information? Casting/channeling an ability causes you to lose all avoidance chance. In this case I thought it was part of why you take several Ravager-wielders to share the pain, if you will.
---
lol he's mad
---
Not only did they gank him but they made him mad.  They won twice.
---
yeah but I put the emphasis on the a in feral as opposed to the e like when you pronounce feral normally
---
Made a friend shortly after BC launch when I had to remake my account. Really cool guy, and was literally the introduction to a guild I played with all up to and through Cata. Some friends I still play with in other games. He died from an OD shortly before the launch of Wrath. I owe everything about my WoW social life to him.
---
I got a suggestion in one of the threads here when I was debating using my original name or his. My bank alt uses his name (on the first server I played on and the current one even though my character has a diff name now because Alliance xD). It feels real good that every time I mail to my bank alt it is his name.

Seemed to go alright for a lot of us 15 years ago.  Even the bad ones.  I’m not anti gear score or anti lfg as a rule.  As I got older, those things were a nice way to save the time it took finding and forming groups capable of getting through a dungeon so that I actually had time to do the dungeon.  
---
They are absolutely not necessary, and working with/helping other players is part of the game.  If you need everything to be near flawless every run, you get a guild party or develop a robust friends list through trial and error.

fuck off with this crap, they are what you say they are when you set them.

That's $150,000 a month.

Stop being "that" guy
---
Why does it have to be men she is attracting?!
---
This is why you should have rolled on a PvE server.

That's fine Its not the only word I pronounce incorrectly. Now I am hungry for a gyro.
---
Which would you recommend focusing on, holy or disc?
---
For me it was, rogue, sap one of em.
---
Tbh I think it's pretty pathetic that you feel like gatekeeping this sub so hard.
---
You'd be surprised at how long a warlock can live for
---
But... mages are nerds not warriors xD
---
I don't think you can do that on tagged mobs in Classic at least for poly i know you can't. Wasnt like that on pserver.

that is brilliant!

Gnome souls only count for half a soul.
---
You got a source for that?
---
Sure, what part are you interested in?  
---
It's quite a mess to be honest, as it's one of my alts and I haven't bothered to make it look right.
---
Boomkin and Ele shamans share the same benefits to a degree, and the same problems.
---
They have very good burst damage, but to counter this they have very bad mana efficiency. Further, nature resistance is probably the most commonly found type in lategame, which makes this struggling build completely useless in some cases.
---
My guild is a bunch of friends, and we have 5 people 50+. Because we've got two healers, one of us runs dps and I usually take that role. My burst DPS is great, but my sustained DPS is at best 1/2 of what our hunter or mage put out.
---
So whatever other answer you get, don't expect boomkin to be useful in pve.
---
A better metric (IMO) was that they had two studios. Even if they pump out influential games, that isn't mutually exclusive to a large studio. However, multiple locations would be.
---
But they still roll need on “caster” swords :P
---
there is no game mamed retail, retail is the game time you buy
---
Then why are we supposed to care about your sob story?
---
I actually deliberately mispronounce gyro, being sure to make it sound as incorrect as possible because I think it’s snobby to pretend to be cultured by pronouncing a single Greek word right, when you’re not Greek, and that word is the greasy equivalent of an Arby’s Beef N’ Cheddar, and not even technically really Greek. (It’s Turkish).

Idiot.  Nobody is going to pay anywhere near 250g for help on that questline.  And DM trib runs are not going to be anywhere near 50-100g, more around 20g just like Mara right now.  Learn your shit man, hunters not only suck absolute dick in pvp and pve at level 60, they also suck dick at making gold compared to other classes.
---
So what, if any, advantage is there to buying higher rank Frost Nova.?
---
It's replace in Phase 2 with [Royal Seal](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18469/royal-seal-of-eldrethalas) and [Mindtap Talisman](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18371/mindtap-talisman).
---
Maybe if you idiots would learn what items are actually good, you wouldn't be taking damage gear you don't even need.
---
The fuck are you talking about
---
Welcome, friend!
---
Just sit on your materials. Eventually the market will evolve and mature beyond those people and their prices. They'll stop being able to sustain themselves to be competitive as everything else (outside of their core focus which they're ruining prices on) go up.
---
It's commonly used to refer to killing an enemy player in unfair circumstances. Whether that is 3vs1 while the same level or a level 60 vs a level 40 are both considered ganks.
---
The problem is big, the best solution is to find out which guild is the best and wait till they get enough lvl60
---
I'm 60rogue and also can't find a guild for raids on my server, there are some.guild but I don't like them
---
99% of negative interactions I have with fellow alliance are gnomes. They have virtual Napoleon complex.
---
You definitely have no clue what you're talking about then. M+ dungeon design was near perfect in Legion. Bosses were slightly more punishing than needed, but overall they were very fun. BfA took M+ and put all of the mechanics in the trash packs, which not only drastically slows the pace of the dungeon (so nothing like Greater Rifts, which are all about speed) and the boss fights are a joke. I played a lot of Diablo 3 post RoS and it plays NOTHING like a BfA M+.
---
I have to admit I stole that from a post I saw on Reddit the other day haha. Still makes me laugh every time tho!
---
It already has updated graphics. They're not going to redo world art assets, and players didn't even want the new character models in.
---
A great spot. Sagefish spawn, herbs, ore and a chest.
---
Accurate. Literal subhumans
---
I'm not new to healing, but can you send me the guide? I'm always looking for ways to improve
---
So I don’t use it as a marker to see where my party members are at?
---
Around 40 you can access areas like Tanaris, Ferelas, Badlands, Swamp of Sorrows, and Dustwallow Marsh for quests.
---
In terms of dungeons, SM is decent for a level or two more, after that you want to be doing Zul'Farrak.
---
How I remember it - [https://imgur.com/l89mUJy](https://imgur.com/l89mUJy)

What are you even talking about? In classic if you traverse an entire continent it isn't "playing the game" to get on a flight path for 20 minutes. I never AFKd in Shat, I always had something to do in TBC. Sounds like you were playing it inexplicably in a way that pissed yourself off. Nobody made you fly, nobody made you use Shat portals. If you wanted to interact with a mage, why didn't you go up to one that was, as you claimed, AFK in Shat?
---
You just want to complain, plain and simple.

Could you explain time dilation in eve?

I didn't make a big deal out of it, my original comment was just a polite correction and comment on the post.  The people making a big deal out of it are those that don't like being told they're wrong.

And the purple/gold pants from the WC quest. Oh. My. God. I got da voodoo.

It's not quite as bad as it sounds; Clerics (essentially the priest of EQ) had a resurrect that gave back up to 96% of the experience you lost. My memory is fuzzy but I believe you still got *some* experience in a raid group as well, so it's very unlikely you'd de-level at max.

You were in a shitty sm cath group then. First of all, any halfcompetent spellcleave will be at least twice as fast as a normal run. Secondly, the iceblock pull inside the cathedral is the most important one xp wise.

Man it's 2019! WoW is more or less mapped out at this point and the amount of information available for how to play the game is enormous. You can check out the warrior section on classic wowhead, icyveins, reddit posts and even youtube videos on how to properly tank and what to do in each dungeon. Installing add ons to show things like threat meters and boss ability bars is also easy and helpful.
---
I was sure this was fake, but I just ran through the flats and her shorts are legit longer now.

Amazing!

Sure, I'll PM it to you! It doesn't hurt to try it out and see if it makes things easier/better/more fun for you. :D

Yep. You hit them in the head and they see stars...

GRIZZLY doing god's work, protecting the alliance from the ruthless mud hutters
---
You dont ever just stay in one stance as warrior
---
Heck, most of use are leveling as Fury or Arms and we LOVE to tank. It’s the main selling point of the class: not waiting an hour spamming channels with “LFM, need tank.” Just find a healer, grab three randoms in the zone, slap on a shield and go.
---
All of them.
---
Battle stance to charge, maybe get sweeping strikes going.
---
Switch to berserker for the berserker rage to make some rage and then whirlwind.
---
Switch around as needed, like to taunt or re-up a stance specific move. Careful you watch your health in bezerker stand, otherwise stick around for the whirlwinds.
---
So fear the skull.. got it! LEEEEEEROY JEEEEEENKINS!
---
I mean according to literally every other game I've played that uses that term yes this was a gank
---
The guy in this video was level 55, not 40.

Even if we went with your definition this is in no way a gank.

You are so bothered by other people making joke. JFC, live a little
---
Godspeed my good man.
---
Haha burned. 
---
That was great, well played friend.

That's amazing!  Thank you so much!

WTF

Rogue
---
Eh alliance had control of the devilsaur farming todat so idk
---
Raid viable and raid optimal are two different things. Every tree should be EITHER raid or pvp viable. Only one needs to be optimal. Classic has straight up dead trees that are at best worthy of 20 points. You're a drag on anything but an overgeared raid if you attempt to go full boomkin, for example.
---
It isn't that raiding is the only thing considered, it is that the gap between the viable and not viable specs are occasionally massive. Shrinking that gap doesn't hurt anyone, it just straight up gives players more options. The premise that more ways to play the game is somehow bad is asinine.
---
Do you consider spawn ganking someone 7+ levels above you to be dishonorable?
---
Warriors with gear
---
Then you have that one person who asks for a portal, says they will buy the rune, and then expects YOU to go to THEM.
---
People are all shitting on mages, but I've never met so many ungrateful people for mage services outside of classic. People practically expect a mage to do everything for free at all times and be happy about it. As if the time of the mage itself isn't valuable. 
---
I try to do my best to be generous in classic, but man it's getting harder and harder to be nice when I see posts like this just shitting on mages and people in game acting like assholes.
---
its a pain in the ass
---
It was just an example number to make it clear.
---
Not a joke, but even if it is putting a "joke" about crying in the comments of a post about someone's dead friend is kind of shitty, yes
---
The halfway point on leveling time is around level 44. So yeah, starting over after getting to 30 is a bummer, but you're nowhere near 60 yet.
---
I play a rogue and try to run away from every fight (more often then not I just end up dying). I don't plan on pvping until I finish leveling. I don't really see the point I have bad gear and don't have the right talents for fighting people. So if someone from horde tries to attack I hit my Sprint and vanish buttons and hope for the best.
---
It is really funny I play in a party with my friend who is a mage and very often we will be running to a quest or something and horde will run past us in other direction 9/10 times they will ignore my friend and run after me. It happened 3 times last night while we were trying to get to Scarlet Monastery dungeon. Horde players would spot pair of us running up the road and make a beeline for my rogue while my friends mage gets away unmolested.
---
My friend was laughing his ass off by the end of it. He claims it's because he is a gnome and people don't notice his character model. I have my doubts though...
---
[No daisy-dukes here man](https://i.imgur.com/ph3RFVw.jpg), you is wrong. Took this just now, she's wearing jorts now.
---
These were going for 7g on the AH yday (Bloodfang EU). 1g with no travel? Bargain!
---
Probably

Gotta get my dots rolling on all the mobs so I can pad the meters.
---
Remulos
---
I lost...
---
it also seems like he has been active in the red pill community despite being married. Looking at his post history has made me switch from feeling sorry for him to sorry for his poor wife.
---
This is pure gold
---
How does horde player call 5 lvl 60 orcs killing a lvl 20 human in Duskwood? "A fair fight!".
---
Wait you guys have your dps wait for marks?
---
[deleted]
---
It varies server to server and also on how many people are online at a moment but most servers have between a min of 2 to an average of 4 layers with a upper limit of 9 based on blizzard clarification.
---
Each layer has unique layers with its own host of resource nodes, NPCs, Mobs, Rare Mobs, Recipes and everything else.
---
Very flawed math. The drops are not independent of each other and each take up a loot drop slot. It's much more rare than you think.
---
If someone is spamming anything about high dps, i'd rather party with them instead of rolling the dice and getting stuck with dps that are clicking their abilities and mouth breathing.
---
Who plans fears? Purple is banish
---
What's the best way to learn how much items sell for in the auction house? I've installed the addon auctioneer for the auction house but when I list items for what is recommended or slightly below they haven't sold. 
---
Also I made a bank alt and learned enchanting to disenchant and sell things, but auctioneer doesn't tell me how much the disenchanted materials sell for, so I'm also lost on where to even try to value those items.
---
Does everyone in your guild have problems spelling?
---
Or they disappear I to different phases.
---
Zug zug
---
The same is true of BC for needing a flying mount.
---
i would read your book
---
Good idea, I'd be interested in some nice short videos about different grind spots.
---
Only thing is that I don't think an hour's worth of grinding is going to accurately portray the amount gold/exp earned on average, especially if you're presenting it as a gold per hour value.
---
I laughed way harder at this than I should have.  Well done sir.
---
I have a good reason, reddiquette is a thing and you're not adding to the conversation. Also only a cringe kid cares about imaginary internet points.
---
Not if my group has a say in things (;
---
Get that spider belt already FFS. Or an elixir.
---
Every had a humanoid mob run at low health and pull a camp or pack or pat that was about to make your day a lot more difficult?
---
This is why warlocks should always train recklessness, pallies should have justice, etc.
---
Efficiency is not my minigame of choice, so I don't know why people skip learning skills anyway. More often than not they are going to end up being of some use to you at some point leveling. Does the 35s training early skill ranks set you back further towards getting epic ground mount than dying because you pulled too much shit does? Maybe. Idk and don't really care personally but apparently there are a ton of people that do. 
---
For some entirely anecdotal evidence I'm outleveling all those people on my list as a holy paladin questing solo with a 2h and some str/agi/stam gear. We all seem to play about the same amount of time too but again, efficiency isn't my minigame... clearly lol.
---
If you're alliance, you can start running DM at lvl 17.
---
And it's not like someone at blizzard would just remember that 15 years ago there was some random character wearing hotpants - there must've been someone crawling through the content and just looking for unacceptable 2004 things.
---
Imagine being hired to work on wow classic only to end up being the sharia police and viewing crappy old 3D models all day long, in order to eradicate short pants.
---
 Good lol! I'm glad I had that fucking sprint macro lol that was the cherry on top for me!
---
Mine is about to reach Hillsbrad... On the plus side she is a rogue... On the other side I think I created just one more of those bastards, and karma is gonna bite me in the ass, one day...
---
The native client can do that just enable them in the options
---
Nice dude. What Realm?
---
I feel like the kick would be you are also a warrior
---
Literally is. Everyone with a sense of humor knows this
---
This made me want to play a druid.
---
Liechtenstein!
---
Nothing like using a dead friend to farm karma. Stay classy
---
As a hunter I love going up against rogues they are one of the easiest classes to down. Every time they try to gank me I pop intimidation/wing clip run off a bit pop arcane shot then concussive shot then I can kite them indefinitely while my pet whittles away their health, eventually they turn to kill my pet at which point I’m free to stand there and unload on them.
---
I don't know why rogues think they can gank druids if they don't stun-lock us.
---
looking at the tooltips it does look like the fel is out damaged with white, and then the whip would add more on it. Fel is much more tanky... still finding succubus is oom more often, but that could be my bias :p
---
Because the community lost trust in 2019 Blizzard and also the whole point of this is "Classic" if you want changes there's always BFA.
---
There's already too many changes in Classic compared to vanilla so they would be pushing it if they add more
---
how u got a working version of grid? can u link?
---
So... I chain sheep the skull?
---
As a warlock can you summon someone who's inside the dungeon to a different part of the dungeon?
---
There's a specific addon I DL that seem to display a big " - AGGRO - " in the middle of my screen when i get aggro does anyone know which one it is and how i remove it? I'm soloing and its kinda unnecessary being in the middle of my screen
---
I think its either DBM or Damage Meter
---
fair enough.
---
Give it time.
---
Hmmm that makes sense but wouldn't there also be just more Whelplings on the Market in general, therefore depreciating in value just from quantity? Or does it not really work like that because it's such a hard drop to get regardless of how many are on the market
---
You were insanely lucky, I'm at 121 runs and seen it twice.  
---
And you don't just go and do some quick runs, its incredibly rare to find a healer to do it since all the healers got their brd loot already. It takes hours just to get a group going.
---
You can summon people to your location no matter where either of you are
---
Controlling powercreep. 
---
TBC Outland greens started to outperform T3 Naxx gear.
---
If you're playing Horde try Boomkin play with a resto shaman to take advantage of Mana tide totem and chug potions. Focus MP5 over Spellpower and your DPS will be fine.
---
This is Classic, you don't need to play into the fucking bandwagon specs, none of the content even comes close to requiring optimization. Just find a guild with cool people who would appreciate the utility role and won't be assholes over a DPS race.
---
Thanks and Yojamba (OCE)
---
I am disappointed to understand this system. Sigh
---
Thanks and yojamba (OCE)
---
You're fine and you're right. Now people are gonna do that shitty passive aggressive thing to you where they pretend like nothing annoys them and you're really unhinged for taking issue with embarrassing and insincere redditspeak.
---
HOW DARE YOU LEAVE OTHER PLAYERS ALONE WHILE YOU ARE PEACEFULLY FISHING. NOT A REAL GAMER.
---
BRD and LBRS are typically run as 5mans, whereas UBRS is a 7-10man. The more geared you are the less people you have to bring. Especially if you are only clearing untill rend blackhand
---
Some mobs like to run away when on low health, they can also pull other mobs so to be on the safe side you can have crippling poison on so they can't run too far.
---
But the line is “You don’t have any friends. Nobody likes you”
---
Here's the ones I'm actively using:
---
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eKQIymcrB05zBgOqV9MO1MPAdgD2glFm
---
I remember running into this place back in vanilla with a couple of friends. Never been back, nor I ever cared to search on the web it's purpose.
---
Back then I just took it as a mysterious place that might be something cool one day, didn't think the cool part was going to be a good memory of my friends and I doing something stupid in a videogame.
---
I hope everyone is having as much fun as I am.
---
Because you keep hitting them in the head and ruining them.
---
i would enjoy if there was some sort of community voting system for certain updates, as some quality of life improvements were actually good for the health of the game (mostly BC and wrath era stuff)  
---
things like increased nameplate range, dual spec, and guild bank all seem to be among most peoples "i'd prefer or be ok with it" lists
---
Ty for info
---
Dark whelping has a better drop rate than the beating heart
---
Seriously. These people act like these fictional factions aren't just an artificial barrier to communication.
---
Stay on engineering, you can get all enchants by other players but not the cool engi stuff.
---
Hammer of justice combined with a bomb afterwards is just awesome for pvp :D
---
Yeah, holy priests are stupidly hard to kill.
---
Thank you for that. Never heard it mentioned before. I didnt play arena much, and quit in Cata. It must not have yet become an all inclusive term yet.
---
I would say the inverse is is more likely:  fewer people will be playing as this game ages and there will be less supply of novel items available. The people who do play will always be getting more gold over time, the price should rise but I couldn't chart that.
---
As with all financial advice I have no idea what i'm talking about and this could be entirely untrue :)
---
This is so accurate and so painful.
---
What’s the best auction prices add on that shows the values in the tool tip? I have auctioneer but can’t get anything to display.
---
That is paying the salary of 10 devs/engineers to maintain it and server costs.
---
That is far and away above what you'd need to keep it profitable.
---
lmfao
---
This was specifically stated in a blizzard post leading up to launch. I don't have it bookmarked though sorry.
---
I can't wait until this subreddit realizes that there are just as many bad players who decided to roll tank/healer as there are dps.
---
If you hadn't seen it yet, he basically states back and forth keeping a rock btw him and the boss. She doesn't go around it since he is staring back and forth so he just moonfires on cooldown. It would take forever but it works I guess...
---
Disabled right now. SHould I enable it?
---
How do people get it to look like this?
---
A shield doesn't make that much of a difference till past level 50
---
People laugh but with higher than average stamina, fort, inner fire, bubble, and shadow form damage reduction a priest, I've personally had great success in peeling shit off lower health squishy members of my team with mind blast until the tank could regain agro.
---
i am lvl 59 warlock now, about to 60 very soon. i did all dungeons other than big ones(brd,scholo etc..) and i have ever never seen any case like this, and my guildies didnt have any issue like this too. i really wonder if people just doing this for trash talking. yes of course for some cases coordination is not good and there might be more pulls than intended, people get wiped, i usually soustone the healer if its not on CD yet, and we just re start, no one even say a word. Even if we gotta run, it is still ok. Shit happens. 
---
All the posts bitching about tanks or dps or healers or their aggro management thingy, what you were expecting? you think everyone will know the whole mechanics to its best and apply it? Seriously if you are not 20-40 man raiding a hard content, just chill and relax..
---
This sounds fun!
---
a myth indeed, I remember this quest and I remember abandoning it after the 10 mob with 0 drops, aint nobody got time for that
---
yea go attack that skull level enemy minding his own business, good luck
---
Yeah, fuck that marking shit. Pulling.
---
God it’s always lvl 60 alliance virgins ganking low levels there then fleeing like a bitch when people come to retaliate, first time playing this game and whilst leveling 20-30 there the same lvl 60 rogue has been camping there for 2 days, I came back a week later to help a friend with the grind and the same lvl 60 is still doing it
---
Lost me at PVE
---
i dont think so, this didnt happen on retail and retail is waaaay more intensive
---
Ok but why dont all the dinosaurs in ungoro drop bones? I really  vaporized ALL of them? Horrible drop rate. Lol
---
Good luck with approximately 60% of PvPers being SL/SL warlocks.
---
I believe summoning them the first time gets them to the entrance. You need to summon them a second time once they are inside the dungeon to get them to your location (in the case of respawned trash or whatever).
---
That’s the thing. That’s what we did and it still won’t drop!!!!
---
Doing nothing wrong, 40-60 can take forever.
---
But i wouldnt grind to much, just swap zones or go for a dungeon. At least for me grinding is really boring ;)
---
Green is also usually banish
---
Square being trap, moon being sheep and star being sap has been the standard for as long as I can remember
---
Your still able to clip under org in retail and get into that spot with the candle and the gravestone of someone a dev knew in real life.
---
\*\*Screams in AOE\*\*\*
---
That goes other way around too. If druid opened on as stealth+cat form, rogue would've been easy kill. 
---
Rogue vs druid really depends on who gets the early advantage shot.
---
Jesus mate. I remember literally sitting there with a group of of 5 people 2 days after launch and killing maybe 200 mobs. They just kept spawning on top of us 3 or 4 at a time and then eventually the Warrior started cheering that we had it only to find that the other 4 of us couldn't pick it up.
---
Disgusting quest.
---
There are a few (2 or 3?) lesser elemental spawn points over the top of the hill along with the elementals for the followup.
---
Well, technically the guy had multiple mobs on him when the mage jumped in.  So there ya go, he was ganked.
---
Another thing to add to this is a more general remark – would you prefer to play a melee dps or ranged?
---
I don't have raiding experience on either Rogue or Mage, but I initially played Balance Druid and transitioned to Fury Warrior, finding the melee experience to be much more engaging and satisfying for my play-style. 
---
Supafly makes a good point about dps becoming a tad boring (personally I find ranged more boring), and something should be said for both tanking and healing as they are roles that players often shy away from for one or another reason, but offer a completely different – and consequently, a challenging – experience.
---
Wow good boi, i respect your accomplishment. So what time you are allowed to go outside to pee? i hope your leash aint bothering you and you are fed with good food. 
---
p.s: those guys are mailman, dont get angry to them. its ok
---
It's all we have fuck face.
---
Leveling takes longer and longer as you inch closer to 60. Zones will have fewer total quests then earlier zones and are spread out which means you'll have a ton more travel time added in. I suggest killing mobs as you travel between quests instead of just bee lining straight to quest mobs. It will add up in the long run. I find in the later levels (40+), I get about 1 to 1.5 levels out of each zone just questing so you need to supplement it somehow with either mob grinding or running a couple dungeons just for exp. Its cliche to say it's all about the journey but that's how the game was designed originally, so that getting to 60 is an accomplishment from hard work and patience, not just a gimme to experience end game.
---
It still means that to me and always will mean that.
---
Yes I think he means Arcane Explosion Rank 1
---
People are going to talk about the meta of a game and share common experiences without being asked. Yes. People seem to enjoy them since it does produce conversation and discussion. What else are we supposed to post in a subreddit made for discussion about this video game?
---
You pull it.....you tank it.
---
there is nothing on that disk you need for classic btw
---
There were investigations and apparently it got tested for human DNA and came up empty. It may have came from the bath, but it's not used bathwater. 
---
Don't ask why I know this, I don't even know myself.
---
/r/wow is leaking
---
Sounds like DBM
---
From my experience, the 19 and 29 brackets are the most popular. I always liked playing pvp with the constraint of having so few abilities and no mounts. Rogue is the most popular by far, but it's possible to twink out any class
---
i spent a weekend on that quest getting only 5 fragments.
---
before work the following monday i got on and got the rest in about 15 minutes cause no one was there at 7am
---
I started that quest today not knowing what it was and that was a nice hour and 20 minutes for grinding my skinning. Otherwise I can't imagine that being worth it
---
Doing gods work
---
I don't think people realize I was joking. Oh well.
---
That was another fish I struggle to sell because the auction house is filled with them, all undercutting each other by too much. Fairbanks is pretty crowded on the Horde side so I guess it's to be expected that there's a big supply of most goods.
---
A cleave is usually a small group composition. Melee cleave is all melee dps, spell cleave is all casters. Some cleaves refer to specific comps for Arenas. Thugcleave is rogue Hunter healer for instance.
---
Do they? Surely weapons is the only crossover.
---
No one cares.
---
May he rest in peace. And may you have many memorable adventures. This almost brought a tear to my eye.
---
I don't have the sets, only in sixtyupgrades lol.
---
This is where you respond "oh sorry, I thought I was in BFA. Aren't we all friends now?"
---
Oh absolutely! I find melee far more engaging and entertaining. Being able to move about and attack is better than casting over and over. 
---
But then again, my main is a priest and alt is a rogue. Is switch off between the two regularly since their playstyles are so different. Keeps things interesting
---
Um, he's not being serious. So... projecting maybe?
---
It's not impressive because any decent druid shouldn't lose to a rogue.
---
its fine mage need to cleave to 60 so can get in the queue of the other million mage for gear
---
I'm saving up now, I'll need like 16k+ cloth which should be close to 1k gold on my server.
---
21k + 12k + 6k (im not even honored) = 39000 / 50 = 780 turn ins 
---
780 stacks or 15600 runecloth from honored to exalted
---
Good for him!
---
But when do I use None?
---
I have determined that this is the "UIDropDownMenu" object. There is some technical info about it here:   [https://wow.gamepedia.com/UI\_Object\_UIDropDownMenu](https://wow.gamepedia.com/UI_Object_UIDropDownMenu)  Not sure if this is useful or not. 
---
Thanks again.
---
Yeah it's literally the same 4sec scenario, just somehow stretched out to a 4 minute video...
---
Lack of flannel?
---
The left. Lol. Try the right/focus on the family losers trying to turn the world into prudes who wait until marriage, have sex with their clothes on, and aren't allowed to masturbate.
---
Had a priest today not even throw me a renew. Basically told me not to lifetap and not to take any damage. I used some bandages for the dungeon and we cleared, but I immediately dropped group because wtf.
---
Green Triangle good for Banish as well.
---
You get a buff when completing the wind totem quest. 1h duration, 30% attack sp., 40% move speed. Basically a 1h bloodlust with sprint.
---
It's relevant cause no one cares about your flexing, you didn't offer anything to the discussion other than you think it's easy. If you think my comment isn't relevant then downvote it and move along. You're just being cringey acting like I somehow wronged you for taking away imaginary internet points.
---
Ahh bummer. Yeah I liked the burst/cc/escapability of those classes, especially if I got in a lil over my head. Appreciate the advice! Bummed I don't have the "my" class in classic, cause everything else has been super fun so far.
---
Build the group yourself and kick out baddies. Make friends with players over time and invite them back. I agreed 40K xp/hour in armory with a stellar group. Socializing is key and optimal group setups helps as well.
---
Using an outdated guide with information no longer pertinent to the game as it is?  Sure.
---
Rogue was actually my lowest level class, so I'll give it another shot! Ty for the advice!
---
We are talking 20s?  
---
I thought we are talking leveling overall. I literally waited with the succubus quest and felhunter quest until I got my mount. I have no clue how the fuck you are so dense to outaggro your voidwalker. Not even a protection skilled tank in instances is going to hold aggro when you go full dots and start wanding or spam shadowbolts after dotting. So why do you think a pet is going to even be able to hold that kind of threat? Thats the real issue here, not the fact that you are too inpatient to see an enemy die from your dots.  
---
Maybe you should have rolled mage, because it seems like that playstyle is alot more fitting for your inpatience?
---
Father Ted?
---
I’d have laughed my ass off if you glitched through Darkwhisper Gorge and were greeted by retail Hyjal in its entirety.
---
This guy has been camping me all week!
---
If it's any consolation I have been in a similar position to you – Classic launch I was always going to roll Fury Warrior (and still am, as Fury Prot), but my priorities changed as I was asked to tank 90% of dungeon runs that I did. I resigned myself to tanking, but I am enjoying the challenge that learning a new role brings – so much so that I made another Prot Warrior alt to level after I hit 60 on my main. 
---
I am still (re)learning the dungeons, but honestly it hasn't been anywhere near as bad as I was expecting – most people are relatively polite, considerate, and patient. The only issues I run into is when people start pulling stuff, but hey, that was probably going to happen even if you weren't the tank. If you're worried at all, just say something at the start of the run and people will chime in with directions/whatever if they need to. Also guides help a lot, but really a lot of the dungeons are pretty straightforward. :)
---
Why are you backing to the dark portal log in screen in the first place? Just close it and relaunch Classic from the launcher.
---
Did you not see the thread where people said they enjoyed the lengthy flight paths?  It increases immersion because *travel should actually take time*.
---
Yeah it seems like a lot of the classes change the higher up you get, I still have a lot to unlock and utilize, which is what makes the decision so difficult! Appreciate the advice though!
---
Hmmm, star was usually sap in my groups back in the day iirc because yellow.
---
Too hard to tell these days lol
---
I totally forgot mindflay took a slot, I’m just wary of blast cause of the threat is all.
---
Rely on taps? man, spirit tap is literally the best spell you have haha! The talent that goes with it makes it even better, it's your core rotation and the bread and butter of a warlock :)
---
I hate to say it but If you're not using spirit tap you're playing the class wrong.
---
to be fair, all water is weak on a per level basis. mage water is the same per level as the normal.
---
You see how straight this sword is? Craftsmanship!
---
Your account name is the email.
---
Yeah doing that takes me to the server list, I can get in, I'm just curious why I can't log in from the dark portal screen.
---
they just patched then bc i wss there lsst week and she was hott
---
&gt;People need to remember 40 man raiding was tuned around 25 competent players in 2004
---
MC and BWL maybe
---
From honored to exalted is 780 stacks or 15600 cloth if the turn ins are 50 each
---
Right on, appreciate the advice. Rogue is actually my least played and lowest level so far. I'll try it out a bit more and see if it clicks. Definitely makes choosing a class difficult because at each incremental level increase, the classes seem to drastically change how they're played.
---
Rip to Kalajeera
---
Have you headed over to Desolace? Usually a great spot for your 30's. That and STV. And Badlands for grinding.
---
We can be. I'm not all that good at PvP, but my heals are solid, my shields come up far more often that gankers would like, and my smites hit pretty hard.
---
This strategy falls apart at the first boss that is immune to cold or can't be slowed.
---
Those landlubbers weren't really tougher than he thought.
---
Grind out a few levels in Desolace then when you're 37-8 head over to Northern STV
---
Druid was actually my first class I made! I unfortunately didn't know I'd be relegated to 'shapeshift' forms the majority of time, which is a bummer because I like everything about the class except for the aesthetics. It may seem vain, but it makes enjoying it difficult.
---
You can SM spam, shouldn’t be too hard to find groups.
---
&gt;Thunderclap, demo shout both are really important to get up quickly.
---
Your MT isn't putting up TClap and he shouldn't have to put up Demo Shout either, since someone else will be specced for it.
---
They control all the accounts, so they wouldn't attack the mobs unless they weren't afk
---
I'm level 37, I've thus far done Hillsbrad, half of Arathi and a bunch of stuff in STVietnam but I'm running out of quests there as they are all orange which isn't great for a warrior.
---
Anyone have any suggestions on where to quest next? I'd rather not do Desolace since it doesn't look great. Dustwallow looks fun though.
---
Also what level should I start doing Scarlet Monastery?
---
You can start running Scarlet Monestary for some good exp and gear. Also, I find this list helpful for choosing zones to go questing in.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Zones_by_level
---
As far as drops from mobs; I have a bank/disenchant alt for BoE items. Should I be saving items for when enchant mats are a viable commodity or should I just focus on getting vendor price to get my mount. I know some of it is personal preference. Overall I want what is gonna benefit me most in the long run.
---
STATE OF THE SPELL AOE TANKING:
---
Introduced a new minigame called kittens in a box. Tanks must keep the kittens in a box. Occasionally a kitten or two will try to run away from said box. Your job is to collect them and bring them back. Rinse and repeat until all kittens in the box are dead.
---
The man clearly needs his copper. You made him starve!
---
If anyone is doing anything while AFK -- that's botting, and is bannable.
---
Arathi pvp is fun as fuck. Ended up in a 5v5 somehow around the syndicate farm where you have to get the amulets, all of us upper 30s and just fucking duked it out for an hour the other night. Shit got real when we saw the dudes on mounts roll up
---
Shoulda done Gnomergan for those sweet fucking agility pants.
---
On a different note, that sucks. Hope it gets fixed
---
Don’t suppose you know how the shadoweave chest stacks up to the tailoring BOP robe of power?
---
while impressive as that is, a mage could have just frost nova'd and then one shot him 0.o
---
As someone who just spent hours chasing tailoring recipes I wish I realized this
---
Unless I'm going crazy, I've only played classic and I certainly remember walking past plenty of Warlock Succubus' doing exactly that. It's both funny and slightly uncomfortable - but better than the Voidwalker bitching about how he doesn't want to exist on this plane.
---
That was all you got from that?
---
It's nice to see Alliance actually fighting back when attacked instead of just running away.
---
147 ubrs runs 7 sacred charges highest roll so far 24 losing hope.

Most warrior bis gear is leather
---
bad tanks and healers come here to complain
---
Please help. How do you get to Thousand Needles as an alliance? I walked to The Barrens and then to Mulgore and got killed by the Horde guards
---
Dude just demolished you with his nerd knowledge 
---
Well played /u/fragment059
---
Noooo... you freeze the nipple....
---
There's so much money in Skinning it's ridiculous! Vanilla WoW really made you grind.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic
---
Oh so the low mana dps strat wasn't used in fights that lasted 2 minutes..... Oh God..... How wrong was I.
---
So I conclude. You dont seem to know how threat works, otherwise you wouldnt use your vw incorrectly.
---
Lol. No one asked you to read these opinion threads. 
---
OP certainly didn't ask for your opinion on these posts. 
---
Why are you here? You just sound like a bitter person.
---
No, the question here is what using the VW gives you while leveling. A quicker pace is not one of them. The sacrifices in speed of killing things that you have to accept by using it is the point being made, which I'm sure for some is fine. To claim it is something akin to the only true warlock way to play tho, noting the mage comment, is mind boggling. If you want to take it slow, that's alright. I have better things to do than giving the voidwalker the time of day to build threat, and so it is for many others as well. When the VW cant even hold aggro over 3 dots reliably, not even wanding, then there is a problem, and why drain tanking is held in high regards.  
---
Also, "go play mage"? What, really? Because I, and others, dont conform to your ideal of the warlock? Get off your high horse. And as an aside, some tanks can hold aggro, at least for a while, doubly so if there's a paladin around (perk of playing alliance), but thats a discussion for another time.
---
I see the title and can't figure out why this hasn't been cross posted to r/funny yet.
---
Go south, not west.  You go straight South you'll see an elevator, still in the Barrens.  That goes down into Thousand Needles.  From there, west is Feralas, East is Shimmering Flats (aka best place in game).
---
You genuinely either have zero reading comprehension or just ignore things the people you reply to write.
---
Omg you're so cringey.
---
/s
---
You can get bartender and then just turn off what you want, no need to completely overhaul like many do.
---
Did you gkick anyone who didnt attend?
---
Mulgore does not connect to 1k needles. You need to walk through the south of the barrens and take The Great Lift.
---
Make your way to shimmering flats. Great place for a level or two experience dump anywhere 30-35. Great if u prefer solo.
---
I think holy&gt;dis
---
That’s a really good idea thanks a ton. I keep my post to Classic bc I figured it a decent none scummy way to advertise stream
---
You mean the day computer viruses can become lethal? No thanks
---
is this why theres cloth pieces with random bits of agility?
---
Why TF is this down voted
---
But Alliance isn't superior.   
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!!!
---
I’m using a 2her, ravager. I’m level 43. I tank pretty often as arms. I also do a metric shit ton of dmg on aoe. Like 9k right now as a 43. Any reason I might want to switch to fury? 1her fury specifically? Do you PvP? I PvP a lot and maybe that’s one of the reasons I will stick arms for now
---
Congratulations. :)
---
As a heads up. Removing stance bar removes flight path cancel button as well.
---
[Oh no...](https://imgflip.com/i/3bky4u)
---
Ganking doesn't really apply when talking about PvE, but if you want to overanalyze the video then he was actually farming with a friend. So te level 60 was actually attacking 2 people at once. The opposite of ganking.
---
I'm not 60 yet, but my best battles back in Vanilla were between a flight path and a Blackrock Mountain.  At least before AQ released.
---
Only on retail Classic FOR THE ALLIANCE !!!!! ALL DAY BAYBEE
---
Alliance is superior because you died in Horde territory?
---
Theres a difference between killing single spawn mob and aoeing camps.
---
Yeah, you really are, aren't you?
---
You can also compare items in a slot to find something that's not a world drop or low drop rate
---
Yep, key Warsong Gultch anti-flag carrier strategy here. I mean, months from now when it becomes relevant.
---
If you use num lock to auto run this is a massive pain in the ass to get used to. I just use the F5 and onwards
---
I'm a bit behind you (level 33) so I can't really answer your question except to say DO NOT DO DESOLACE. Place is fucking average. You could maybe to the stuff at the fishing village if you're Horde, but the rest of Desolace is a POS.
---
They thought you might be on the elite quest and you couldve just helped them anyway. Expecting them to wait for you to finish the raptor kills, run north to hand in at nesingwary's then run back is ridiculous. You're the selfish and entitled one expecting them to wait that long for you.
---
Well since Classic is.. well classic it's actually not out of date. 
---
What is out of date is the format that it's in.. paperback.
---
We have way to many online resources nowadays that are easier to find more accurate information on.
---
i think thats true only for the higher ranks, the rare rank gear is a set value i believe, but totally attainable without nolifing it
---
Why wouldn't I? In case you dont know, the VW applies a set amount of threat that doesnt scale, nor does it taunt on the regular ability, which drasticly limits how much threat it can do. And as a consequence it puts a harsh limit on how much damage you can do, and therein lies the problem. 
---
It. Is. Slow. And there is nothing that states that a warlock has to go slow and steady, to the point where the VW is able to maintain aggro. The VW is just insufficient, doubly so when not talented, that is all.
---
[lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0)
---
Nobody gonna take someone in quest greens and blues to aq lmao
---
Weeeeelp. Time to turn that account into a twink.
---
What's your new main going to be?
---
Actually that's why I made my bank alt a mage lol
---
So I have a level 60 warrior (horde) and I want to play as a 2h fury warrior instead of the typical dw spec. From what I understand people typically go hamstring or slam and I would assume that you want a slower weapon for Slam builds. Not really sure about Hamstring or if that's even worth doing in classic. What is my priority with weapons with either of these specs; i.e. do I prioritize max damage, speed, str, ap, etc?
---
30g ain’t much. You’ll be ok!
---
I've seen it both ways.  I'm not sure if it's server dependent or faction dependent.  I played alliance rogue on one server and horde rogue on another - it switched in between that move.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Your post wasnt about any meta game. It was to feel good about your self about how you play the game your way and then provide straw men for how too many people won't play your way. 
---
You're literally just fishing for validation.
---
Even with cross server BGs there will be queues.  In retail vanilla there were queues and on Nost when 13k ppl were on one faction had queues.  Either way nobody can say for sure if there will be queues until BGs are live and you can rest assure that even if queues are only a few minutes, the top rankers will be hearthing and farming HKs
---
In EVE, we just call Primaries..
---
They don't even stay alive long enough to call secondaries..
---
That was almost word for word my exact story from beginning to end.  I could write a post about my experience and it would look like I just copy pasted yours.  👏
---
As a healer, I despise the go go go mentality.
---
Start SM spam as a mage.
---
Shimmering flats, desolace, STV, some quests in Hillsbrad/Alterac Mountains, some quests in Arathi Highlands.
---
This should be a decent chunk of options for you.
---
Frost dk is good now?
---
Maybe there was no one around and this isn’t meant to be taken seriously???
---
Aq.... 20? The gear is pretty on par with BWL, it was meant as a catch up mechanic.
---
Same with ZG, the gear is above MC.
---
Probably didn't even learn them to save money for mounts.
---
Try turning Anti-Aliasing on, then try, then off again.  See if any effect.
---
Pets do not gain stealth with the player.
---
Because no one wants to help plug his twitch
---
Just received an “Enchant 2h: +7 dmg”. Is this +7 added to each swing, or is it modified by strength too? Ty!
---
No it won't come out as lol. If it did it'd be too easy to communicate with the opposite faction and people wouldn't need to go out of their way to make their go to retail macros the way they do.
---
That was a fast WTF
---
Aren't those two refusing to speak to each other which is why you go back and forth between them? Been a while since I played alliance.
---
I tend to avoid life tapping if I'm below 50% hp personally.  I've seen some like deplete their entire hp bar so they have 1% hp and they get mad when a small critter one taps them... like dont be an idiot.
---
Lol sure did.
---
At lvl 40 how would disc healing in dungeons compare to holy spec?
---
Wow didn't expect that. Sorry for your loss mate. What a lovely tribute.
---
That instance was Razorfen Kraul. You didn't go south enough. You needed to keep walking about another 40 seconds south, where you'll reach a giant cliff, and an elevator guarded by tauren. You ride the elevator, and that takes you in to 1k needles.
---
I picked up bis 19 bracket gun gave it too a mate in the first week now its week3 he is still lvl21 i shoukda sold it #feelsbrokeman
---
You dont, if you are willing to compromise on how much time it takes to chew through things.
---
However, I dont think you and I have anything to discuss. And save your lecturing for someone who asks for it.
---
Can some9ne clarify what's worth pickpocketing? Currently lvl 30 and never use the skill.
---
I am a new player so I don’t think I’ve come across this quest. It reminds me of the quest where you have to get a sword from yetis. I think I killed over 100 mobs before I got the quest item
---
As a feral druid I would usually pop out of bear or cat between pulls and throw a regrowth as my mana is usually wasted but it means I'm potentially locked out of utility during a fight so I don't tend to do that anymore.
---
Damn i forgot these had actual meaning back in the day.
---
Enabling it should fix the screen tearing, but you will be limited to the native frames per second / refresh rate of your monitor.
---
Basically bag space is really limited, and traveling to a major city can be costly/time consuming. So instead you can mail stuff to your alt when your bags are full, without having to take a major detour.
---
We are doing the same thing and he just stays dps spec with no shield but tanks. Pretty easy to heal him.
---
Good luck finding a tank, particularly as more tanks realize the perks of being in demand.
---
This may run it on lowest setting. This work stations atent met for gaming they are used at my work as a call center rep. I recommend saving up more money and get a gaming pc.
---
Awesome!
---
I think shorts are literally at the bottom of the list for the PC Police. Don't tell me they give a shit when you can still look like a scantly clad babe in full plate armor. Most likely this was unintended or an afterthought.
---
Or they are fully aware of the true value of this leather belt. “Aahhhh” “hehh hooo”
---
The problem is there is really no way to know the real faction balances. Blizzard broke the census add-ons so the population stats can't be updated.
---
oh, so you guys are just doubling down on being wrong.  Got it.
---
How's spirit stacking for mages? I know warriors get a huge bonus to Health Regen but if you have a swap set loaded with spirit will it cut your time down?
---
This version meme format is an edit of a previous version, which had Jaina with blonde hair. Why are you using the later version which was edited to look like retail?
---
&gt; WC gave me 2+ levels in one run, frequently high tier dungeons will still give me 1 level per full clear. That adds up a lot and it's the only thing I can really see that you're missing.
---
Really? I've done most dungeons I can once and the xp they've given so far has seemed kind of underwhelming, especially with the time it's taken to form a group and all that.
---
If they didn't have much water it's no surprise, just have to make due, drain life or whatever you can.
---
atm if want to find group go mage
---
I am not level 60 nor do I have a mount but I'll def give it a shot :)
---
Its been know for 15years now that horde only take fights they win everytime ive done wpvp in my career of wow every horde raid clears out after you wipe them once its just what they do, its best not to try and have fun around them as they will always try to wreck it
---
Do I need to kill the guards first?
---
OMG! This NPC — wearing the shorts made famous by a character — is paying homage to someone???? 
---
Shut the front door and get the heck on out of dodge............ ........... ........... ........... ...........you’re an idiot.

Me: ....I didn't ask to be in your group...

*You are now being ignored by Random*
---
I did a few of the kill-quests in Desolace. Lots of running, but not the worst. Swamp of Sorrows has a few quests to do and Badlands as well
---
My issue is that I'm living out of my country for a year. :( I don't wanna pay for a gaming PC, and then pay for the delivery back home. My friend who used to live here had a similar circumstance, and had to spend £350 to have it sent back. 
---
I wanna get something cheap that I could potentially discard/recycle/leave as a gift to my predecessor if I need to.
---
According to warcraftlogs currently top dps in third place is a boomkin.  But it could also be because aren't leveled up yet.
---
So until level 34, what do Warriors do with only those skills?
---
Come on Slardar! WTF!
---
They expected him to help kill him, then have to wait for his long-ass respawn time. They were effectively telling me "help me do my quest. No, I don't give a shit about you or your quest."
---
If you think that attitude is not absolutely toxic then you operate in another reality. And then you turn around and tell me that I somehow owe it to them to help them, despite their complete unwillingness to help me. Sorry, chief, that's not how social interactions work for functional members of a society.
---
If I had been in their shoes, I abso-fucking-lutely would have helped them kill a few raptors and waited for their return. Why would I not? Unlike you, I'm not an asshole.
---
I’ll pull nearly the entire set of spawns on my mage and AOE them, sometimes when I’m lucky I’ll get one shard from that. It sits in my quest log taunting me as my xp/hr ticks downward.
---
Shadow Priest.
---
Healing, instant shield, a silence, an instant fear. Instant dot, 1 second cast time mind blast. Instant 50% slow with mind flay.
---
And 30% of the damage they do they heal back with vampiric embrace. 
---
I don't think anything beats a good shadow priest except a good rogue. I'm leveling atm 50, and nothing has beat me except a rogue that keeps me locked out from casting so.
---
Precisely why I don’t do dungeons.
---
Anything with pockets. Ez money plus the random lockbox
---
Because warlocks are used as ranged tanks on certain bosses.
---
you cant just slap this meme on anything and think it makes sense
---
I haven't played wow in years, but this is still in my head.
---
It doesn't meet the minimum specifications. It would probably hobble along, but honestly? It's not worth that amount. That processor is, at best, an E7500 which is over ten years old and was a mid-range processor when it launched.
---
It really bears repeating - Sul'thraze is not a good weapon. At least not for Arms. It's decent enough for ret because they have no instant weapon+x attacks, and 2h fury can manage since Bloodthirst gets it's damage from AP. But for Arms it's worse than either weapon from Archaedas available 6 levels earlier.
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
Oh no you havent youve hit the high way to lvl60 just sm grind till 42 then zf grind till 52 then your on the BRD straight all while avoid ganking and making phat gold in the process
---
Best PvP : Whitemane-US &amp; Herod-US

---
Hey mate. Could you write a quick add-on list please?
---
Wow you're right. Classic truly is a strange game.
---
Oh look, an elitist
---
But its da aspect of cheetah brudda
---
I mark the tank with the star because I find it's helpful to know where to go if I pull aggro.
---
Uhh, no. Your joke just doesn't make any sense.
---
I was more saying that you're douchebag in general, but whatever. You do you.
---
Honestly... Why do you play on pvp server?
---
Honestly, it comes down to knowledge of ones own character. That plays such a massive part.  Locks do have a lot of tools though. You also have to think about consumes, what types of consumes your opponent is going to use, and so on. I play a lot of priest, and the problem with them is that you need consumes. You can run out of mana so fast without having a decent way to get it back.

I want to see Brad do Molten Core.  What server is he on?  Maybe we can talk to some people there and see if we can get him tagged along when he gets to 60.

Deadmines!  Of all the dungeons, this was one of my favorites back in the day.
---
This guy gets laid
---
I'm halfway through 58, herb/alch are maxed and I have some good recipes. I use pots all the time for tanking, and I make a profit on mats I am not using for pots I need. Very happy with alch thus far.
---
Why not have it based on class colors? Hunter trap green, mage poly blue, Druid hibernate orange, etc?
---
/r/IAmVerySmart
---
I went with a variation of DS/Ruin and use Succubus.
---
With potions or without potions? 
---
With potions, I can just put shadow or frost protection potion to absorb 1000+ damage. Very cheap to make too. 
---
Also engineering helps a lot. 
---
Spriests get messed up by elemental shamans, SL locks get beat by rogues, frost mages get beat by spriests and maybe lock too. 
---
Spell casting classes fair better in 1v1, but are mana dependent and prolonged battles will often lose. Open world battles will probably get jumped by rogues or hunters and kited out of range while viper stung. 
---
Any class is good 1v1 except warriors.
---
Have had healers refuse to heal the lock and its a great laugh watching a 1v1 break out
---
No, I understand what you're trying to make a joke of, but the "free real estate" meme doesn't fit
---
Ally were doing this to us on my server. And we are the favored population. 
---
Good on you for defeating those cheaters! Ally or horde those people deserve to be defeated!
---
Iron Grenade + Holy Wrath works pretty well if you're an engineer.
---
Darn it. I thought as much. I'm looking for something that can at least let the game run along, even if it's not aesthetically stunning. But I may just need to face the fact that I may need to wait until I return home after the year. I JUST WANT TO HEAL PEOPLE!
---
I’m a level 27 mage and I currently have the pagan wraps of frozen wrath equipped. Should I swap this for a chest piece with more armor and intellect instead?

Anyone know how to disable the auto repair gear option when talking to a vendor who does repairs? I am not a rich night elf and I generally don't like to constantly repair my gear

You only get the buff if you don’t have a imbue on

Wf totem ain’t for you it’s for your party
---
Yes please but if you could would you be able to do guides that both horde and allaince can follow that would be sweet
---
Pretty sure that must be one of your addons doing that.
---
Bene is not that hard to get. Pugs, which generally have a requirement of "60ish, breathing, and attuned" have killed Domo, which is a 50/50 drop for the eye/leaf.

U can clear both and still hit the 5 instance cap
---
Ah thank you very much.  Figured as much.  Good luck and have fun out there.
---
OG is massive and so spread UC is nice and compact
---
lol this post is literally going to get removed for low quality meme, fucking morons
---
What’s the psychology behind high-level gankers killer players of lower level than themselves? If I know the source of their motives, then I can find some way to become a deterrent to their behavior, so they would find no motive in ganking me.
---
I know at the most basic level it comes down to stroking their ego. They want to feel good by feeling powerful by beating up lower-level players, plus they get enjoyment from it as well. So, to counteract their motives, what would I do? 
---
1) I could keep letting them kill me so that the repetitiveness bores them. I remember in another MMO a guildie let a try-hard high-level gank him so many times that the try-hard don’t even care to gank him afterwards lol
---
2) Make it not worth their time to gank me because too much effort and time is needed to kill me
---
3) Have high-level players or group up to beat them so hard that they run away in shame
---
So if it was a horde player doing it it would be accepted? Haha go play a pve server
---
No. Stay on the path running straight South. You will get to a lift.
---
If in doubt, you should google a map of the zone you're in and it will show you a fully uncovered version so you can see where to go.
---
What character frame addon do you use?
---
Everyone can run to princess without aggroing a single mob at 60.
---
End game? Shockadin. Holy Shock Ret Paly. Absolute destruction. Unkillable. 3 damage immunity shields, endless mana, movement blessing, stuns... Need I go on?

Then put on a downvote and stop whining. You‘re wasting our time

How dare you be so presumptuous as to assume he doesn't exclusively own all nodes in the region.
---
This is a super common question so I am going to copy paste my reply about LW/skinning.
---
Trying out lw/skinning is fine, but be aware it will be very expensive to keep up lw to your current level, and it will almost definitely put you behind on your mount gold and you won't be able to buy one at 40. The profits are few and far between for crafting professions while leveling, and they are almost purely gold sinks. Feel free to craft your own head if you want, but most of what you craft you can buy for less than the material cost (or basically at cost) from the AH from people trying to offload crafted stuff while leveling it. Also, don't forget that even though you will be using your own skins, most recipes have other costs or training cost to learn them, and you are also making less money because you aren't selling your skins. Again, it is still fine to do this if that is what you want to do, but just be aware of what you are getting into.
---
For alch, the story is similar.
---
Mages are light blue :/?
---
As somebody who has been mostly taking their time leveling, (I play a lot but am only 53 300 cooking and major profs) sometimes being super efficient is fun, like doing the BRD aoe farm as a mage it’s legit fun when you get a good group of mates trying to see how high you can push exp per hour and how many groups you can pull without dying.
---
I'm vegan
---
This is forced diversity
---
Did you guys have a rivalry before this? How do you know he was trying to gank you?
---
He didn't target you until you moonfired him and people sneak past me at the raceway allllll the time without trying to attack me.
---
Yeah I’m level 43 had a lvl 45 mage try to kill me last night... I literally stood in place just fucking him up and healing back up. I absolutely love priests.
---
&gt;but 1-20 is horrific
---
1-20 is like 4 hours of played time (basically nothing), and every class is broken at those levels, lol
---
This was a really important conversation and I definitely don't regret reading it all
---
It’s been nice but biggest difference otherwise is paladin (when I played in vanilla) was very forgiving if you messed up - at least solo and while leveling. As a mage doing AOE pulls, if I do one thing wrong or RNG gods hate me that minute, I’m probably dead.
---
Probably that spot in North Felwood that was popular back in the day, or the Southern end of Eastern Plaguelands with the lake full of water elementals. You can fish up pools of water in Azshara as well.
---
I heard that Herod had too much Horde on it?
---
Is there a way to backup and import macros?  Planning to do a clean install.  Thanks.
---
Sexy. You were looking for the word sexy
---
Don't fall off 🤣
---
A Tauren Druid attacked me outside the yeti cave but otherwise all the horde I’ve encountered in Hillsbrad are chill. However the Horde in Ashenvale can eat a dick.
---
“This.”
---
I fucking hate that.
---
I did. Too late haha
---
You mean life tap? I use it but not while im getting hit by mobs solo leveling. I was saying I dont like to rely life tap for that scenario specifically. Im not new to game or playing a warlock. Of course I use it.
---
It was for a paladin, and more just because it saw cool to do. I just didn't think he'd replace it so fast!
---
No.  Blizzard intentionally made gear with crap stats so the players can appreciate the good items even more, and to be able to easier identify the difference between good and bad loot.
---
You can always hop on a PvE server
---
Naked except nightscape boots.
---
Bad rogue is bad, should have killed you before you could even shift.
---
The fact that you are being downvoted for stating that is alarming. Dunno if it's shitty healers who won't admit their limitations, or bad players trying to replicate what they see poorly(maybe both?). Either way it's funny to see people call tanking without a shield in low lvl dungeons bad, when fucking onyxia was dw tanked with a 20man raid.
---
Yeah this is a very common cognitive bias in statistics/probability. People tend to remember rare events because they tend to be meaningful events and so we also tend to disproportionately weigh them because we are more like to remember them then all the other times. It can also become confirmation bias if you already believe that you “always roll bad”.
---
I hate to agree with a filthy alliance, but I think you’re correct.
---
Lmao right.
---
I spend all my time in UC because Org sucks. Once you know UC well you can get to everything important fast.
---
you didnt even use curse of elements lol
---
Pls stop dotting moon!!!!
---
No it isn't.  If you have nothing else I guess.
---
Honestly, 99% of players don't come back for round 2. Rez and move on. If you get that 1%, go play on an alt or play the auction house. If it's real bad, graveyard Rez and hearth. If they're camping GY, pretty sure you can run to another GY to Rez and hearth. 
---
In all the time I've played, I've never had to run to another GY. I've also never had anyone wait more than 15 minutes while I played the AH.
---
damn  that'scrazy

Sweeping strikes, mortal strike, whirlwind, and overpower are all based on weapon damage. While leveling in random greens you don't have a lot of hit or attack power, but it is relatively easy to keep a 2h up to date. A nice slow 2h axe is especially easy to acquire while leveling. I'd suggest going for mortal strike at 40 and using rage for these instants.
---
it's ok, those PVP folks are quite slow on the uptake and have trouble reading anything more that 1 line of text.
---
:)
---
That's a grey item, no use other than to vendor.
---
It was just a pretty sunset in The Hinterlands.
---
Slavering Worgs in Shadowfang Keep have super fast 1.2 attack speed, too!
---
So I got Jaina's Firestarter today.  Is this something I should sell or use? Currently have Icefury wand.  I have no idea how much it sells for because none are on the AH.
---
Amazing. Don't remember that at ALL but can't wait to get there
---
nice analysis
---
No, they won't attack you unless you attack them or a Horde player near them. You just ride the elevator.
---
Typical Hunters man, its not a meme for no reason.
---
Listening to the players is the first problem. Players aren't good game designers. Players only ever ask for things to be made smoother and easier and less frustrating. What they don't realise is that it is the rough edges and quirks and oddities that very often make a game fun.
---
Its a reference to a famous wow twitch streamer.
---
Look dude, I'm not arguing with you. You made a claim, I refuted it because you used an absolute that was demonstrably untrue. You asked questions, I answered them. That's it. If you want to argue with someone, you'll have to find someone else.
---
so if they have to be within 5 IQ points of you that means they need to have an IQ of 10?
---
Oh shit I forgot to put in that it's ElvUi *facepalm*
---
I had a priest in ZF repeatedly calling for the mana spring totem like it was Windfury or something. Had to try and explain how useless it is.
---
Well on the brightside this game is about to get a lot more fun
---
Went back in time to 2004 and shot college self to prevent him from ever playing and avoiding this massive disappointment.
---
This is exactly what I wanted, thank you.
---
This is what makes classic great. We need more people like you.
---
Because then we’d be right back where we were. TBC will bring flying, Wrath will bring gearscore and LFG, Cata will fuck up the world again, Mists will bring LFR, etc.  
---
Makes *way* more sense to do a “Classic+” model. Keep the core game the way it is, how we like it, and just expand on it. We didn’t fight for Classic just to have them take it away from us in a couple years. Or split the player base by introducing TBC servers.
---
Kang the decapitator from ah
---
Share what? O_o
---
Yeah 5 is pretty common to be able to disenchant.
---
Given the context it's safe to assume they're talking about classic. Note the use of present tense.
---
Enhancement shamans have wanted to roll back to two handed combat since forever. Leave the dual wielding to the rogues and warriors.
---
Right.
---
I mean the original vision of WoW priests was a lot closer to D&amp;D clerics than the modern version.
---
Gz!
---
The point isn’t that you should think it’s funny, the point is that it isn’t to be taken seriously.
---
I hit 300 cooking at level 36 by leveling it together with fishing. It's so easy to max out cooking through fishing, but unfortunately buying all the recipes you need is kinda expensive.
---
The fishing is a nice change of pace from the questing and dungeons, kind of relaxing and helping me wind down.
---
Ectoplasm: great taste, less filling
---
NoT aLl HeRoEs WeAr CaPeS
---
Same. My GF let me play for about 2 weeks until she was like "I miss you". Took a few days off.
---
&gt; Not sure why people hate speed runs/spellcleave so much.
---
Because people who saw it &lt;wherever&gt; and think it's a good idea decide that randomly running into melee and standing in the middle of their own frost nova'd mobs is a reasonable approximation of "spell cleave."
---
Having every pull be a clusterfuck of the tank and healer trying desperately to keep damage-dealers alive and then having to wait a full drink between pulls is neither fast nor efficient and it certainly isn't fun for anybody except the guy who apparently enjoys when his dungeon runs consist of alternating between yelling "YOLO!" and getting rezzed.
---
If you're an AoE DPS who knows what they're doing, you've got at least 1/3 better chance of avoiding the kind of players that make the rest of us dislike "speed runs."
---
Also a very good way to annoy your group after the 5th "oh fuck it resisted" or "how did it see me" of the instance.
---
Omg.  I forgot I had this.  I might also have to break it out.
---
Because the lower rank skills are still useful.
---
Very useful.
---
Oh that makes sense. Oftentimes the priest will heal me although I have tons of skills and a racial that gets my hp back so I am fine going into a pull at 25-50% hp. That explains why the priest gets aggrod by a single mob often. I wish the priest would only heal me when I have to use my hellfire aoe, which is rarely unless I am with other mages
---
You don't need a shred of humor to understand this phrase. It's not a joke
---
Broken tooth is boring since he’s so common, I like hunters that at least have a little bit of uniqueness
---
Probably multiboxing
---
I did a dungeon the other day where I was outhealing the priest on some pulls with drain life. Sure, it was mostly because they were a priest and it wasn't a particularly tough dungeon but it still felt great to be top in both damage and healing.
---
I still hate that druids got a flight form in TBC and warlocks/ paladins didn't get another mount stage :(.
---
honestly if you really want it at 40 you can get it. Its not that big of  a deal.
---
Don't know about your server. But the money in herbalism is insane on mine.
---
Fuck those elementals.
---
Two thing.
---
First: the blizzard who made wow in 2004 isnt the same blizzard that is making wow today.With how the recent expansion have been going no one trust them to make more content that will fit the current style of classic.
---
Second: going for the osrs approach wouldn't be as lucrative as rereleasing TBC and probably Wotlk.Those expansion content is already made and they would only need to implement it like they did with classic. It would be more money for less resources basically.
---
All of that being said, we at least have 1-2 year of content since AQ Naxx and a lot of othet stuff isn't even unlocked yet.
---
Ah, ok I'm just confused again.
---
I grouped with a random player that flew to the AH, grabbed two and tried to give it to me for free. I think they were about 75s on the AH. I tipped him 1g and we continued questing together for a while. Top bloke.
---
Nobody is forcing anything down your throat. If anything the Classic+ route is more likely to be forced on Classic players than TBC would be. They wouldn't close vanilla servers after going to the trouble to modernize them.
---
Enhancement shaman with enchanting, obviously.
---
if he has any issue with druid try warlock 
---
you get a pet to tank and can bind both your rotation and pet attack into one macro 
---
i essentially leveled my lock with 2 buttons
---
Actually due to the way rage generation in classic works stunning is actually bad because you cripple their rage generation.   The only thing you should stun is things that chain cast otherwise you actually hurt the tank more than you help.
---
Is the first page just ‘Grab a bunch of mages and AOE SM Cath over and over again’?
---
Grats man!!!!
---
Get yourself a nifty stopwatch!
---
My experience as a tank is simple.  I mark a skull from time to time when it is really necessary (mostly double healer pulls), and the dps does their job every time.  The rest of the time I mark nothing, and do my job.  People pulling aggro like crazy and wiping us has never been an issue.  I don't get all these threads.  Damn near everyone I have played with has been perfectly competent.
---
Shady people on both sides on the coin I agree. Scummy for either to do.
---
I always preferred aoe farming as a paladin over a mage.
---
Not a trinket but an offhand you can equip during combat is the skull of impending doom. Also great for a movement burst. 
---
Even better, it's an offhand so you can equip in combat. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4984/skull-of-impending-doom
---
Triangle could also be roots (melee mobs).
---
Tbh, it had quite long but interesting quest chain full of lore. Almost the best one, I believe.
---
Dont feel bad, I've been playing a warlock as my main pretty much since 2004 and I still thought the blueberry was the way to go, because that's what I'd always done. 
---
I've been experimenting with the succubus today since reading this and it is much more efficient imo and stuff dies just as fast and I can survive multiple mobs just as well.
---
Rogues got the boob icon cause we ate the best.
---
I warrior tanked through BC; CC was *needed*. Star is sap. Every rogue knew.
---
Yes.
---
Unsure what to do at 30+? Go SM
---
Unsure what to do at 40+? Go ZF
---
Unsure what to do at 50+? Go BRD
---
which is why he is lucky???
---
You cant make me donate to you, succubus
---
Second Wind is 7% drop.  Burst of Knowledge is 9% drop.  And Briarwood Reed is probably the most hopeless, because it's 25% off a rare spawn and every single caster wants it.
---
So am I, I just don’t know the stat weights between the two. Logically concluding the damage/healing would be 1:1 with shadow damage but I don’t think that’s how it works
---
They don\`t.  Or maybe I just think that they don't, but they do.
---
Thats really well written up and it looks a lot of fun, ill give it a try. Thanks!

Part of ElvUI
---
I'm having a strange bug in Classic and I was wondering if anyone had any insight into the cause.
---
At random points during gameplay, the Classic client just kinda shits the bed. It will loop the same quarter second of audio, NPCs and environmental objects won't load, interface panels like the world map, quest log, and NPC dialog boxes won't load (except for NPC text, which floats where the panel should be). Players and enemies vanish. If this happens while I'm on a flight path, eventually the ground unloads and I can see the 360 degree skybox. If I try to log out or quit the game, I only get a "you cannot log out now" message. After a minute or so, the client stops responding and I have to force close it from the task manager.
---
As far as I can tell, it happens at random times. Yesterday it happened as soon as I logged on. Today, it didn't happen until about 3 hours after log in. Two days ago, it didn't happen at all.
---
The 9% hit cap is only for yellow damage
---
also, mace spec is BiS dont @ me
---
I wish I knew lord of the rings as well as you do.
---
I feel dumb.  So. Much. Time. Wasted.
---
Thatsbjotbtoo weird. Are they talking in guild?
---
Haha for my cath runs yesterday I recruited 3 warriors and a shammy healer. :)
---
You get like a 5 mins grace period when you log out before you can reconnect.
---
You don't even have to crash the game, you can logout as normal to reboot the game and you won't be put back in queue.
---
I'm not saying toxic didn't exist.  I'm saying it was a disadvantage.  It is much less so now.  Now you can run every instance and every raid being an asshole to everyone.
---
If a warrior cant gain threat on a mob that's been stunlocked then he sucks as a tank.  
---
Two words:  Battle Shout
---
Big props to Blizzard for adding accessibility built into the game so awesome people like this guy can join us!
---
few things better than killing someone who tries to gank you.
---
Words from a casual moron crying about video games because if he can't be good at games or have time for games, no one can.  
---
neglect all aspects of life for this game. Seriously. WoW is the only thing that matters and reality is fucking stupid. Do whatever you can to keep playing this game.
---
If you're serious about getting a 4% drop rate item, you should probably be running it with your guild who will let you have it, instead of complaining about someone taking it because it may only be very close to pre raid bis.  At this point in the game it's a huge boost to either people.

No reshade, no graphics enhancements. Just standard max graphics.

Look at you with a skinning dagger.  I bet you feel special.
---
I think I should just type in party chat telling the healer to leave me alone unless absolutely necessary. Cause if I am not casting hellfire I will never pull aggro with dots and wand and am free to heal as I please.
---
I am more concerned with the high-level players who come into low-level contested zones for no other reason than to go around, camp, and kill lowbies.

Shadow damage = spell damage, except spell damage is ALL spell classes ex.) Frost, arcane, nature etc.
---
Especially for mages if you don’t know how to play the match up.

you're gonna throw more dots, more dots, more dots, c'mon, more dots. k, stop dots

You \*do not\* want me to fear something.

Ever. At all. Under any circumstances.

I think what you meant was \*\*\*SEDUCE\*\*\*.

Which, yes, only works on humanoids, but it also doesn't make the mob pull the whole god damn dungeon, and most dungeons are humanoids anyway.

Smelting can help, but mostly if you're buying ores off the AH or from another mining character.
---
By the time you mine enough to get 2 or 3 stacks to smelt, you've blown past the orange and yellow smelting ranks and will only get like 5-10 ranks.
---
Overall there are more herb nodes than mining nodes (you get more ore from 1 node than you do from herbs) which means you actually gain ranks faster as herbalism.
---
There's also no built in time sink like smelting with herbalism.
---
You forgot succubus seduce
---
The problem with that quest is that the mobs that drop the item are mixed with mobs that don't so noobs grind on mobs that don't drop them and get frustrated. I was constantly messaging people when I rode past there telling them they were killing the wrong mobs. The quest mob drop rate is pretty good.
---
They're banning people who exploited layering in dungeons, not out in the world to get better spawns/competition.
---
This looks like a fun setup. Grats to your buddy
---
Condom belongs to fire mage or rogue, if tank is pally. They simply cant hold the agro between taunts.
---
The other 280-300?
---
No, that'd be a weird use of time. Clearly they were all flogged instead.
---
Prevents runners from going and grabbing more mobs.
---
You sound like you enjoy the taste of pasta.
---
A bunch of healers vs a Shaman healer, not the same thing.  Shaman are pretty much like Pallies for Raid DPS.  A novelty until you get really geared, or a one trick pony, like with Nightbringer.  A Shaman running Resto can drop mana tide; they can trinket what I used to call a "mini tide"; and they're a fit for most caster groups.  A shaman running enhancement is a DPS enhancer for Melee groups.
---
A lot of folks like to look at their DPS meters and think it's a dick comparison game.  
---
A Shaman is the penis pump of raids.  While everyone's bragging about the size of their dicks, you're off to the side knowing its really you who brought them there.
---
Nonsense.  Just delete shamans that think there's any reason to play anything other than resto.  Or maybe 20/31 ele resto hybrid for pvp.  I say this as one myself.
---
I’ve had several tanks throw skull up halfway through the pull. If a skull is up beforehand, sure. But if you put a skull up after I’ve dotted everything else already....
---
Damnit, I think I need to educate myself. I read something that says layering exploits are banned. I'm a fool
---
Noice. What level did it take you til to get it?
---
Nice grinder
---
This is not vanilla exp we wanted!
---
Great levelers, great in wpvp, great in BGs, great for farming, teleport, portals for free gold, free food/water. Their only downsides are their upsides, they have to make portals and water for everyone.
---
Agreed. It’s a role playing adventure game.
---
I remember when gold ore and copper ore had the same icon. It was a struggle.
---
Im new to fishing and im kindve confused isnt that just the same as normal fishing? press a button to throw your hook out, click the bobber, then throw your line out again?
---
That looked like he was ready for the bug, like he had done it before. It looked staged to me.
---
Still not really an acceptable bug to leave in, so good to get the word out about it, but looked pretty staged.
---
Cheers mate.
---
Back story was I joined a group. The 5th joined, a warrior. Says he doesn't want to tank. I check to see who he is, and it's the same guild as the rest. 
---
Okay, I know where this is going, I'm starting to type my leave, and I'm just kicked without a word.
---
As dps, you come across this in a usual amount, but sometimes you just can't ignore the rudeness, right?
---
thats the glory of the game. u can do the 5 hour dungeons you enjoy. while others can go fast and not waste their time, neither effecting each other
---
Haha who has ********** as a password? So easy.
---
A duel is when I jump on you while you're drinking at low health, right?
---
The 2 stack is sweet nectar for sure because you are low from the tank pulling new mobs before you finish drink and are still oom.
---
You just pick empty layer and its easy lol..yesterday few ppl spammed "alliance killed Cairne" while he was right next to me lol...Layers breaking immersion
---
I play tank, except one time and can’t confirm (based on what my guild tells me as well) there are a lot of shit tanks as well. However when I tell the dps what to do and they don’t listen after the third time. Bye
---
Somewhat unrelated, but I have started polymorphing low health horde until they heal to full then popping the sheep with a rank one fire blast as I run away waving.
---
Ok, who's cutting onions in here?
---
Booooo
---
&gt; Because you can do MC and Ony with only 10% of your pre-raid BiS list.
---
And that's also about 10% of your playtime.  Farming pre-raid bis is the fun part for a lot of us.
---
And how come the sign for "Just Maces" is a sword?
---
Sloppy writing, that's how come.
---
Uhhhh not sure if this is joke? Orrr...?
---
Shadow priest, mage, or rogue.
---
Mage and rogue with higher skill caps
---
This.Layering defeats the point of this
---
Assuming you’ve got 5/5 in Wand and Spirit tap in both specs, I’d say Disc is the better healer.
---
Holy talents you’ll be at 1/5 Spiritual guidance max, where Disc you’ll have 5/5 in mental strength, 3/3 meditation and you’ll have divine spirit
---
spell cleave is when a single target spell has an aoe on hit effect, aoe is when there is a targeted area or area around the player or in a fixed location.
---
See it’s more complicated. I think that when people are first learning how to play tank it’s really good that they’re stressing over agro because they’re learning how to protect their team and keep agro on mobs. However once you start getting the hang of it and knowing when’s okay to let go then you can relax. I’ve personally been seeing this change on me as I progressed through tanking. (With new dungeons I’m usually anal) (when I know the capabilities and spells of my party “then I can let go” when appropriately because I know the strength of my party) so a tank stressing the fuck out while learning about the class and race spells is good.
---
As a warlock its always fun to just put dots and run away.
---
At times, I've been known to fail. My deepest condolences for assuming the gender :P
---
Hey so, newbie hunter question here. More specifically from classic WoW. But when the square means hunter trap, what's the hunter supposed to do? Lay out a freezing trap in front and then team lures out the square enemy to it? We talking about the freezing trap right? How do you target a specific enemy with the trap?
---
Very similar... my buddy’s first character was a warrior and we played together a lot in vanilla (literally walked into Walmart together to buy the game). He passed away in 2012 and is the reason I’m playing classic and also a warrior. Very cool man. I’m half a level from 40 myself!
---
This is why i always ask "you ok with second war/rogue/mage" most are thats not problem while leveling.When ppl start looking for BiS it will be
---
it varies from raid lead to raid lead.
---
When I raid led 25s my general scheme was
---
skull - 1st kill
---
x - 2nd kill
---
square - usually 3rd kill target but on big packs it was just another CC target
---
moon - ALWAYS the poly target
---
triangle - usually second poly target, possibly a fear or hunter trap
---
diamond - first fear target
---
circle - generic CC target
---
star - shackle target
---
Skull, X, and triangle were all almost always 1st, 2nd, and 3rd kill target while the rest were usually CC targets based on the packs and who needed to CC what
---
I mean arms warrior or paladin filling for the tank spot and ret paladins, shadow priests, shamans, or druids filling for the heal.
---
How do you know they have no other reason?
---
Have you asked them?
---
Seeing everyone that I fought in wpvp in classic I would say at least 70% are new player or really bad PvP players and I'm really not exaggerating. The amount of people that I attack and simply don't react at all makes me sad

He didnt take stormstrike either. I have no idea what your point is?
---
So I'm relatively new to WoW (and just about brand new to Classic) and I'm leveling a Night Elf warrior (level 12) cause most of my friends are Ally :(. I love Horde so I want to have a main to also play (and hopefully make some friends on my home team), the only issue is I have NO IDEA WHAT TO CHOOSE.
---
I love being useful to a group whether in WPVP or dungeons or what have you. I've kinda been tossing the idea of an Orc Rogue (cause I just like Orcs), an Orc warlock, or a Tauren druid. Druid mostly for its versatility and the other two because I am hating leveling a warrior (only saving grace is I got friends to make the suffering considerably less).
---
I enjoy all roles so that tends not to be an issue and I love complex classes that require a bit more skill to play in all other games. I just don't know what falls under that category. Any help would be appreciated along with good professions to take with the class. Sidenote: I'm an absolute sucker for lore so gimme some lore if there is any to give (or not if you don't care lol).
---
It is known.
---
It's just neat and has Goblin Podracing going on.
---
Don’t buy it then :)
---
first four are good, but last four are up in the air. For me star is definitely sap and condom is for the tanks protection triangle diamond is whatever extra stuff there is... of course if there's no mage/hunter i use square/moon as whatever CC since they tend to be recognized as cc
---
As a side note, no decent healer or tank for that matter thinks you have agro because their unit frames would be setup to indicate which party members have agro. Decent being the operative word there.
---
Why tho?
---
Congrats you are the next person to prove they don't have reading comprehension. I don't really feel like explaining it to you. If you can't read a sentence and understand it well there just isn't much hope. Enjoy your life I'm sure it's going to be super exciting.
---
In my opinion, a tank who has an issue with this is not good enough of a player to be tanking. I’ve not lost threat a single time on my warrior yet. Rogues chain stuff all the time in my groups. It’s bad for DPS but they do anyway.
---
+1 for rogue
---
I’d argue that people seeking world pvp guilds are more likely to be casuals than those seeking raiding guilds.
---
Haha
---
That is not true in the slightest at all whatsoever why are people spreading this lmfao.
---
Full PreBIS notrinkets is like 270 spellpower let's say, I had 220 at level 40. Don't spread bullshit
---
Siphon strike+evisc is engaging? Kinda kidding, but yeah I wouldn't call levelling as a rogue engaging unless you are staying away from the combat swords build which is by far the fastest.
---
The point was that not casting the spell when you switch targets is a good thing.
---
As a fellow mage I enjoy questing and world content mostly with a few hours of AoE grind thrown in once in a whiel for the change of pace. They're both fun in different ways. I play in the world to enjoy the rpg elements of the game, grind in dungeons for the lols and multiplayer coordination aspect. 
---
I did some mage priest runs where we would try to pull more than we should've, killed bosses way higher level than us with cheesey broken kiting strats, and shot the shit while drinking between pulls. I've also done many regular runs because that's also really fun. I like vanilla because of the variety.
---
why look at markers when i can just press multishot and make them all die
---
Report him. That has been bannable on live since vanilla.
---
Mine is particularly noticeable if I'm mousing over textures while moving
---
That quest was cancer
---
So wholesome! Glad you were there for your friend even in death...
---
I had the same problem, you constantly have to jump between zones and it's annoying as hell. I just hit 39 today so hopefully questing gets better in the 40 zones and I get stay in one area for more than five minutes and do a stack of quests.
---
Vendor it, become the maddest lad.
---
Note that Berserker Stance has a 0.7 threat modifier, so aside from using Whirlwind every 10 seconds it's not in your best interest to actually tank in this stance.
---
There are no twinks in Classic.
---
You're not counting redundancies, you've calculated the odds of it happening for a specific person winning. 3 people were rolling, what are the odds that any person ends up winning both rolls? 3 in 9 or 1 in 3; there are only 6 possibilities that lead to items going to different people and 3 where they go to the same person.
---
Assuming the same group composition, the odds become 1/750.
---
That explains the post title then?
---
Staves are maces without heads
---
yeah now i feel like a schmuck for leaving the leveling guild i was in, but life goes on.  i'm sure i'll find a home somewhere, eventually.
---
Yes sir, spell damage is better than shadow damage as spell damage would help our fire abilities out as well. Shadow damage and spell damage are 1:1 when talking specifically about shadow spells.
---
well done! crazy that you made it to 60 and got your epic mount within a month of the game coming out this time around :)
---
wat
---
Or you could be like one of my old guilds that, for some reason, did all of that in reverse. So star was the kill target, circle was second kill, etc. Subvert the norms.

Hello sub! I’m currently exploring what class I want to level as an alt. I currently have a 60 holy priest whom I enjoy but want a character that I can DPS with. I’m not very huge into casting although I feel like I could tolerate it and maybe come to enjoy. On retail I do play a rogue which absolutely is my favorite class but in classic, rogue is much slower and not as sustainable like in later expansions. I mainly want a character I could chill on, mostly PvP, possibly farm. 
---
Suggestions?
---
Interesting, thanks. I'm a warlock so not sure how he is walking on the water but just knowing i can engage from up there without him evading is great.
---
Oom
---
... Wait how
---
Checks overhealing and spell ranks used
---
Ah.
---
Yeah, similar experience for me. I'm happy to heal dungeons but am specced shadow and people seem to be looking for dps more than healers to form groups on my server for some reason. Due to that I've been dps in every dungeon run except one.  
---
Shadow has been great fun, I'll drop out to off heal if needed or hit my "taunt" button if there's a mage being silly running everywhere scared from a mob. It's weird not being able to use mind blast unless I actively want aggro but \*shrug\* can manage without it.
---
Oh man I love you guys
---
I don’t actually see anything happening. Is it the ****BRUH MOMENT****
---
:,( it's sad because it's true
---
Not even an excuse? Just hit a wall?
---
You sound depressed. 
---
Or you are just being a bitch.
---
The drop %s are based on them dropping from either slot.
---
It's wrong.
---
It never dropped for us. Always the Leaf.
---
So you generate rage from a mob that isn't hitting you because it's stunned? Interesting.
---
All the good and bad considered, I'm having more fun in this game than I've had in a long time. Especially the world PvP.
---
I'm a Priest.
---
They're assigned by color basically. Freezing Trap because a frozen mob looks like a big blue square. Moon = Polymorph because Mages have a light blue class color. Triangle = Hibernate for no god damn reason, maybe the Zs are green? Diamond = Fear because Warlocks class color is purple. Not sure why Star isn't sap given Rogue class color is yellow, and honestly Circle should be Priest CC because Priests bubble you, and the circle is a condom, which is kinda like a bubble and both protect you.
---
The first time you respec it only costs 1g, so no, it's not very expensive. The cost goes up every time you respec, up to a cap of 50g, and it'll stay at 50g every time after that. The cost declines if you go long enough without respeccing, something like 5g per week or per month.
---
I think it's definitely worth it to respec to frost, the increased CC capabilities mean it's much better for leveling.
---
You forgot to switch accounts and you sound like a lunatic calling people toxic assholes over something this minor. Saying that if these people dont wait 8+ minutes for me they are assholes is ridiculous. They're not assholes, they just dont want to waste their time on a stranger, and the respawn time is not that bad by the time you would return. They probably assumed you could solo the respawn or find another group easily. All you had to do was throw a bit of dps at the thing, which is barely an inconvenience, and move on with your life like most players do, instead you post a huge whinge on reddit about how you /ignored two regular players.
---
Right. Now we’re on the same page haha. Cheers
---
Start your own guild.  Start your own raid.  
---
/lookingforgroup LF39M MC 
---
Start clearing trash, farm trade goods, down some easy bosses, start adding/friending competent players.  Build from there.
---
Lol I was beginning to think I was the only one who remembered these in some of my groups...
---
same thing with the nicker is called something else SJW Agenda
---
Lies!  Although, I don't understand why neither of these things happens.  As a tank in TBC, I appreciate a pet with growl and as a healer since vanilla, ofc I'm gonna heal the pet, unless I'm going OOM, then he's the last prio.  But more than a few pets have saved the day before.  And considering the range of hunters, who do healers think is pulling the aggro off them when it's not the tank?
---
Could you explain the "pallies for raid dps"? Like more buffs for the raid instead of direct contribution?
---
jesus christ post this everywhere omg
---
I just lost it on this...
---
Doesnt mean u can't get rekt
---
I know that's still in, or at least the sound is. I hear it a lot in the AH.
---
I’m new to wow and my experience with almost all undead rogues I’ve see has been negative. Usually a skull player being a jerk. I was just making a joke. 
---
I’ve been having a blast with the game.  Loving every second!
---
&gt;Why wouldn't we be salty. Having to wait for re-spawns because a mage is running around pulling everything is infuriating,.
---
Because this barely fucking happens since almost all mob packs in the game have at least one ranged mob in them, making it impossible to aoe farm them? The list of viable aoe grinding spots is incredibly small because of that. So either you made it your mission to chase after mages and hang out at these particular spots or you are full of shit. Sure, you might come across something like that a handful of times (like at the hillsbrad farms, which are overrun by mages) but 99% of the time that shouldn't be a problem at all.
---
I have solo'd her a few times as Feral. I spend all of my mana on Moonfire + Starfire while kiting her around, HoT myself up, then go into melee range and fight her in Bear Form while my mana regenerates. Once I have a healthy amount of mana, I wait until she does her AoE attack, then run out, heal up, and do it all over again.
---
Guarantee my way is faster than doing it like this.
---
I think BlizzardActivision have some ''diversity officer'' or something that does this. Also why items like the nicker got renamed.
---
Thats not a circle. It is a nipple
---
This gives me an existential crisis. It could have been me over there getting blown up and going blind. I hope the best for that guy and it's shitty what happened to him. Fuck. We only have one life and you could die or be horribly crippled at any time for factors beyond your control.
---
Sounds like a good time bud
---
Its wild that you think what they asked of you and what you asked of them were 'the same'
---
Thanks for the help bud! I’m going to be doing some research into it some more. I love the fire spells, but I’m down to try out frost and all its capabilities as well!
---
Did you by chance have a druid tank in that run?
---
Literally nobody gives a single fuck you retarded retard
---
That 1 frost mage makes life so much easier tho.
---
If I lose Aggro on 1 mob, that sucker is so slow, he ain’t hitting nobody.
---
Same with AoE, even standard non-elite packs.  Try running with 2 rogues or warrior dps.  You wish you had some AoE.
---
One of our 4men group is turkish yes. We are at his and his friends "gameroom". Fenerbahce is his friend, my buddy is trabzonlu :-)
---
A solid zero
---
For a melee cleave group sure.  If you are the only warrior, it's a problem when you have all the threat.
---
figures.. lol

Yeah nah thats just me how i look after 10 years of world of warcraft

What's the point of this? Does she drop something?

Mages get a life tap too it looks like

Google it

Daaang an amored cow riding an armored cow! Lol im just jealous im 43 and still dont have my normal mount. T_T
---
You are so far behind. Most good spot will be taken and overrun. So its prob not worth doing. But  you could make a gold guide about the worst spots I guess. Or just get 6k xph fighting for toxic horrors in felwood.
---
V true.  Next will be this same story except he will dong 60 and repost.
---
I quite like it, 10 for aesthetics, unsure about functionality.
---
LoL had a druid try to gank me in the same area, turned out about the same for him.
---
I will show him this reddit post soon :-)
---
It’s actually not that bad.  On a 3 min pull, if I lose Aggro on the first, mark it skull and I start sundering the 2nd target.  The dps nukes skull before it even touches anyone.  By the time they start dps on the 2nd, I’m already stacking sunders on the 3rd target and maybe moving the group towards the next pack.
---
TL;DR: tank can just start building Aggro on the next target
---
Grats on the new tractor!
---
What mods are you using? Love it
---
Its literally the basic elvui with one or two things moved around.
---
Let's put it this way then.  When I was healing the 41, my mana was constantly stressed and the tank died because I was oom or I died.  With the 38 tank, I barely had to drink because he held full aggro and took half as much damage.
---
Still better than Aasmonbald
---
Lol pretty much but using tukui
---
You need to check your eyes mate, in the first fight he uses rank 1 frostbolt 2 times, and scorch once, instants (coc/fb) 5 times.  
---
Why would I even have a conversation with you when you don't even recognize the spells ?
---
I would do mage first simply because of the utility aspect. You would have the best gold farming class in the game, amazing damage and the ability to travel very easily. Later on if you wanted to roll a rogue, you could do so with quite a bit of wealth.
---
Movement abilities exist for more then just PVP.
---
I'm looking forward to Deadmines...
---
i just killed the stronger elementals. they drop the same stuff but were less packed for me most of the time.
---
i think you'd be better off just titling it 'live stream from me leveling 1-10 when classic released'.
---
What about banish?
---
But where is fear pull?
---
The problem with allowing your pet to auto-cast all their abilities is that there is no way to tell them to prioritize one ability over the others.  This means they will use any ability they have enough Focus for when it is off CD.  In practice, this often leads to your pet using all their Focus on abilities like Claw instead of Growl, leaving them unable to hold aggro.  For this reason, I have taken to keeping only Growl on auto-cast and manually casting Claw and other abiltities.  Obviously in dungeons/raids, you will want to reverse that.
---
If I wasnt a fkin holy priest... &gt;&lt;
---
Huntard alt is comin up quick tho!
---
That and the "bruh" sound that plays every time it's triggered.
---
I love rogues! We focus targets and they die so quickly. We usually have one aoe like warlock or mage to deal with non-elites. But it’s not a big deal
---
You are insanely lucky.
---
I was watching a YouTube video of asmond getting the legendary mace, in that video it’s all serious and they are trading around materials. Someone got into his trade window and tried trading a bottle of bleach super quick. It cracked me up. This post made me think of it.

Play the game to have fun. If you arent having fun, youll quit playing the game. Remember: **fun**. Its the most important thing to worry about when it comes to playing this game. Now if you want some class suggestions, hate warlocks and want to stick it to them. Play hunter or warrior. Warrior is the 2nd hardest class to level, but you absolutely SLAP the shit out of people, your biggest bane will be mages. Hunter just destroys warlock because of the pet, you can trap their pet and do really good damage at the same time. Also once you get beastial wrath, you are immune to fear and wooo youll melt those warlocks so quick. Hunter is also one of the easiest classes to level, id say theyre on the same level as warlock, if not easier.  
---
Anyway just try and have fun with whatever you pick.
---
Some have rolled characters on more than one server because their main is a different faction. A lot of people have also server transferred. Either way, easiest way to tell is looking at the server populations.
---
-Everyone likes that-
---
How do you play that match up?
---
Hi,guys. So, im new to WoW (that doesn't mean you have to cheer me up) thats why I maybe was wrong when I thought its fine idea to go to high level dungeons as healer with Shadow priest spec.    
---
I shouldnt do this and should looks for DPS slot in dungeon parties? (which is a bit akward for me, cause I dont think I can manasustain good as DPS SPriest in dungeon, where you need to cast for a long time with no Spirit Tap, but maybe I just need to learn how to do this right..)
---
Basically, every spell gets a certain percent of your bonus spellpower/healing that depends on the cast speed. Generally, fast-casting and instant spells gain less benefit from spellpower/+healing than slowe-casting spells.
---
For a full list of spellpower coefficients, see https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/formulas-spell-coefficients-classic-wow
---
Why would you cast Defensive stance before Demoralising shout? Demo shout can't be used in Defensive stance.   
---
Why would you want to start the fight with a Demoralising shout? The threat it generates is very bad compared to the rage you spend on it, its main benefit is for mitigation.  
---
How is that Demoralising shout free?
---
Yeah if you're marking and communicating then they're just bring dumb.
---
Go Arms, tactical mastery will be very useful for taking.
---
First moment I thought "huh what does he mean, we werent grinding this moment?" 
---
Then I realized
---
What level range for the dungeons?
---
Druid is the wonky class in Classic. They are strong but only once you have truely mastered it.
---
Mages are the Kings of Classic. Basicly the class that is good at everything. Try a mage and see if you like it.
---
That bootybay/ratchet boat is a deathtrap. I either go on with rolling deep or I don't go on it at all lol
---
NGL, shamans are on the tougher side to level. I honestly didn't really mesh with it until I respec'd to ele at 40.
---
In groups, maybe. Solo PvP a warrior isn't winning shit unless the lock sucks or gets lazy
---
42-46 for ZF, i think...as AtlasLoot addon says.
---
Id grind SM for cash for a while then start what ever account you want and be able to fund it easily
---
If this was a 40k Ork, thay would absolutely work
---
Ya this dude just created his own meanings
---
You can share it with us! Congrats, horde scum!
---
That mage was bad 😂
---
yeah, hunter, or if you prefer caster classes you could roll a warlock. Grinding soulstones isnt really bad, and i mean, the whole game is a grind to begin with, soulstones are only one aspect of the class they arn't essentaily and you will somewhat passively recieve soulstones anyway, regardless, hunter is cruise control levelling experience, also if u like healing priests are pretty consistent, also on god by a$ap rocky increases levelling speed by 90%
---
Damn, you must be fun at parties.
---
The forbidden pool is nice and cool
---
Yep. It's always peaceful for a bit. Then it just snaps and horde takes over. I went with 2 other friends  and tried to take over. Lasted about 5 minutes till a 60 horde showed up. 4/10 lessers. I'll complete it at 55 and have my revenge!
---
Gotta keep that rank 1 banish around.
---
You're not though.
---
No your mom is fake as shit. Check wowhead.
---
Yep same, I normally swap over to frost about 30-32ish with

---
*drinks Jungle Remedy*
---
Lol I also killed a Mage in the Wetlands who AoE farmed Gnolls. Was on my Badlands run and saw him. I don't like AoE farming mages so I killed him and went on my marry way. While I am generally not an ashsole, I do like that PvP servers allow me to be one if I want to.
---
Spend 90% of fights auto attacking and the rest either sunder armoring or heroic striking (Which is just a slightly stonger auto attack) It's really not very eventful
---
funny how?
---
Is that guild name a FE: Awakening reference?
---
Now I know. 
---
Another's misfortune is my learning experience.
---
Wow man, thanks for such insight and advice! I’m headed to the sack now, but I look forward to experimenting with that first link you shared tomorrow when I hop on!
---
I know reddit doesn’t do reality much but can anyone give me the origin of this system?
---
You can 100 percent heal dungeons as shadow. Anyone willing to heal in dungeons are welcome.
---
Different models... Lol y'all got tricked.
---
yeah its pretty simple. only allow character transfers for one faction to regain balance.
---
idk both a pretty good choices tbh, do you prefer melee or ranged, do u wanna make portals and blink, or do u wanna pick locks, sneak around and 1 shot ppl. Do you wanna aoe as a mage or 1v1 as a rogue.
---
Who the hell capped snowfall?
---
You should be able to heal most dungeons as shadow. Also no one knows your spec. If you join as a healer make sure shadowform is off and they'll almost never know you are not holy.
---
Nothing is next. You're being a paranoid idiot.
---
Just curious about how effective you’d be. I’ve been shadow since 40 and it is hell to find a group as a SP.
---
But i mean - even 45+ dungeons? cause i think higher level - higher risk, and people maybe dislike such "half-healers", cause this will be risky for party?
---
Found the huntard. It's about decency. If you could get BIS weapon with a 20% chance versus getting two weapons independently and taking them from basically every melee class except shamans then fine. We'll make groups without hunters.
---
the physical server is hosted in Sydney Equinix datacentre in alexandria... so yes I'd say its basically aussie
---
Does the hunter work differently in classic compared to retail? Before I switched from ally to horde I mained a Dwarf hunter.
---
I have had no problems finding groups as a healer up until BRD (im 55). I always let them know that i am Shadow spec before going and people seem fine with it.
---
Fuckin troll post
---
You can heal ZF no problem as shadow priest. I do it and have never had an issue. Once your 55+ you need to be healing spec to heal properly, although it all depends on your group of course.
---
\*Zip\* Go on...
---
It goes both ways dude. Ive been ganked enough times to know to kill every alliance i see if possible. Been body camped for 20min outside booty bay by 6 alliance all 5-30 levels higher than me. I never wanna see a 3min+ respawn timer again.
---
If you have two gathering professions, you will earn money by selling the fruits of both. If you have skinning and leather working, you won't profit from either because the fruits of the skinning will go into leather working. You will save money on making our own gear but you will get enough gear from drops and questing to cover that anyway. The first option will also help you get your mount faster.
---
By the time you get your mount, you will be earning gold way faster. Buying the mats to level up leather working to say 225 will not be an issue at this point.
---
that's a camp
---
What I wouldn't give for BCs Paladin to somehow sneak it's way into Classic
---
YEAHHHHH def.
---
Ele resto hybrid is the perfect example of how all hybrid classes should work in vanilla.
---
181 runs in arena and have yet to even see the savage glad chest. i think ima just give up at this point
---
Well they do get to do Spellcleaves. And warriors have it even better. If you do it right, you have the easiest leveling experience as a warrior. The first few levels are hard, but then at around level 30 you just pull Meleecleave runs with 3 other warriors. It is insane.  4 Warriors + a shaman pull easily 2-3 times the DPS a normal dungeon group pulls.
---
I see. Maybe i should try doing the same, telling from the start that im SPriest. So people who dislike them wont worry and will ignore my message :O
---
Are no quests available at Silithus? Been waiting for quest mobs to spawn for 20 minutes because I thought horde killed them or something.
---
is there a certain recommended adds to train weapons?
---
At least in my groups purple diamond usually means banish (wlock)
---
It holds aggro enough over DoTs and will save you a lot with sacrifice when shit goes down.
---
Generally I'll pull something, DoT it up and let Voidwalker take it, pull another, DoT it up and Fear it, pull another, DoT it up and Fear it, first Fear coming back at this time, Shadowburn/Wand it down, pull another, etc. until out of mana or mobs.
---
Let me introduce you to the joy of melee cleave runs. And also the joy of tanking and friending the best DD's you've seen as well as healers.  You just give them a call whenever you wanna tank something. They will happily jump on the opportunity.
---
youre good for all dungons until you get to the mid/late 50s stuff like BRD and beyond. and even that is kinda debatable. that guy was foolish. healers can even be a little underlvl’d for a dungeon, moreso than any other role. if youre on top of things and mana mgmt you can even do a little dps along the way. a good group will even try to make sure you get last hits on mobs with your wand to get spirit tap. 
---
also ironic that the druid says he cant heal in tank spec, when druids have a well documented coolie cutter spec with heart of the wild (like 30 pts in feral) that makes them legit healers lmao. bottom line that guy doesnt know your class, or his. bullet dodged.
---
That is a lot of time for lvl 40
---
Translation: "I would rather shield my family from everything than teach my children self control and consequences. The Mormon church will guide me in all things, well, as long as I keep paying my tithes and never speak ill of them."
---
this is 100% accurate, from my experience.
---
I see. So at +- 55 level I should think about respec\^\^ Thx, will remember this :)
---
I see, that link is very helpful ty.
---
Sounds like fury/prot spec warrior is for you. Your dps will never be top, but you'll be able to tank pretty well and increase dps for whole group/raid by increased threat. You just need to collect different gearsets for each role, and saves you money on respecs.
---
Obviously, I also kept every single way to make easy gold secret that I've found. Be it certain recipes in alchemy that give me a ton more money or just specific plants that grow a lot but are expensive.
---
At least when CTR took out the trophy girls it was because they were made playable characters.
---
I dont have kidney shot at lvl 40 and the only downside is a mage gets away once in a blue moon. I have intense gear for my level so i just try to kill them before cheapshot wears off lol.
---
But why would they patch it?? Like, why go through that trouble?
---
Here I am wrecking classes 5 levels higher than me as druid.
---
If you keep a few healing items and don't go full retard when playing it's fine. Also helps if your tank is not 8 levels under the recommended one.
---
I remember the post you're referring to. The reason the reporter was warned was because they too were on top of the buildings in Gadgetzan when the GM talked to them and the reporter was also being snarky to the GM.
---
This is sacred markings used by a more sophisticated people.
---
If there was an animal shelte in WOW it would be packed and rough
---
There are a handful of quests that begin elsewhere, but I think all the ones that start in Silithus will be introduced in a future phase. It's basically a wasteland now.
---
dang. I'm on thunderfury
---
lol get wrecked horde.
---
“You have been disconnected from blizzard services”
---
I actually stay in defensive after going battle for sweeping unless I’m popping whirlwind, it makes The healer’s life a lot easier. 
---
A nice thing I’ve been doing is have a macro that pops me into zerker and whirlwinds then pops me back into defensive immediately after. Only thing you have to watch out for is to make sure you’re around 25 rage before you tap the button as it will dump anything else above that. Usually a couple cleaves does the trick quite nicely
---
Loading in on hc and seeing the Naga Arms Warrior from the balcony always made me want to give up and come back tomorrow.
---
I would hate to see what an animal shelter would look like in wow
---
I believe those were added in a later patch so they will be added in another phase. Might be wrong though.
---
So what are the main differences between the 30-40 lvl link you posted and what the other gent posted?
---
Pros/cons?
---
Look at his username, lol.
---
“If you think you can heal with a dps spec, then I can heal with a tank spec”
---
Yup, that’s also correct
---
thaks for saving me hours
---
Yo! I literally just killed Tethis with you the other day in STV! Such a small world. Glad to see that you honored your friend through a great character! Congrats on the mount. &lt;3
---
Is that the Herod set? I love that set and am working towards getting it as well on my Warrior (Lvl 36)
---
Which is in fact selfish. Because that is making the event about "him" and not about his friend. It's suddenly his work, his achievment, him padding his own shoulder. On top of his friends grave.
---
UO was awesome back in the day.
---
I've reached level 40 with my shaman, respecced to Elemental with that cue. The first quest I had after respeccing to elemental was to kill these lesser rock elementals. Now some of you might now, they are immune to nature damage. Which are all of my spells except for Fire and Frostshock.
---
If ur trading gear that gives u 1 spellpower and losing 1 stat its a very good choice. When you start losing 2 stats to gain 1 spellpower then its on the verge of not being worth it. 
---
Im talking in pve solo leveling experience now and not the end game.
---
He wasnt passive aggressive in his comment, you were. Therefore the only person who could be considered hurt is you
---
Druids may be versatile but are just as miserable as warriors to level until 20+ and you get catform+skills. Endgame they can satisfy any role (except moonkin tbh) and don't let anyone tell you different.
---
I mean that tends to happen when censorship is brought up, people have opinions about it still even in a troll thread. 
---
Do you think political correctness doesn't ruin things ever? Are you high ?
---
DS/Ruin is the best PvE spec for maximizing your single target shadowbolt damage.
---
SL is great for survival, which makes it great for outlasting one or two enemies in PvP. Pair with either Nightfall or Shadowburn for that killing burst--not sure what's the better secondary discipline with SL. Damage output is low but you can survive in the midst of a fight to e.g. defend a flag for a long time.
---
SM/Ruin is probably your best all around spec for instances (not raids where debuff limits force optimization) and battlegrounds. You're squishy but your dots and single target spells are both on the high end so you can really deliver some punishment from the edge of a fight. You'll die more often than you would with SL, but you'll be more lethal as well.
---
yes sir it is, just dont have the chest for it, and prefer the gloves from cath over the set gloves, though i do have both
---
The mobs in [this quest](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2681/the-stones-that-bind-us) are level 57 and are invincible without the quest item, so you can grind weapon skill on them forever if youre high enough level.
---
Nah, nipple is for the tank. The rest is right though.
---
Oh thanks for the reply. Calling it min max makes absolutely zero sense
---
That is born of necessity though, nobody would claim that shadow is the better healing spec, only that anybody leveling should be forgiven for their leveling spec.
---
As a frost mage, Is "increases damage done by frost spells by 10" The same as "Increases the damage and healing by magical spells by up to 10"? Or do they scale differently? Assuming im casting frostbolt.
---
TIL!  Glad no one will find out my password is bigtiddiebiddies69420
---
Gay
---
thank you!
---
Yea most pieces are harder to get, now that Headset is very easy atleast haha
---
It's safe to assume that every PvP server will have more horde than alliance.
---
I don't actually recall but the only way I can think that it's a fair enchant across the board is that it would be +7 DPS and then the computer would figure how much actual +damage to give you. 
---
Can probably google it though :/
---
And he's a druid... I heal with my druid Tank spec as well as anyone.
---
Amazing!!!
---
Endgame they focus on healing primarily or melee dps for a few willingly to go the extra mile to compete.
---
Levelling they can perform any role, primarily melee dps and are fantastic due to selfheals. They do create a lot of threat in groups however so enemies are more likely to attack you.
---
Earthfury is a "migration server" and people that move are naturally less likely to stick out the game. The concern with moving there is long term. Will enough players be around in next year and the year after for the later content? 
---
But in the short term, it's a good call. More balanced making it easier to get groups and quest. A growing population but in no danger of facing a queue again if Blizz reduces layers unlike the servers they are offering transfers off. 
---
If your guild has jumped I would recommend you do the same. Or just in general given your level. If you are leveling at your own pace on a PvP server and you are only level 50 when Phase 2 hits, you are in deep shit. Battlegrounds won't be released so he fight for honorable kills to rank up for the sweet PvP gear will drive the minority faction out of the zones. It will be KoS. Every FP will be camped. They will not be able to afford mercy. If they let you live the next Horde they let kill you instead may be leapfrogging them and taking their rank. 
---
Phase 2 was estimated at 2 months from launch at the earliest so it's not coming soon but the first 30 levels are a lot quicker than the last 30. I would jump if I were you.
---
As long as you're only casting frost spells, they're effectively the same thing. They stack, so if you have +10 spellpower and +10 frost damage, it counts as +20 spellpower to your frost spells.
---
The one thing you really want at 40 is actually to switch to elemental lol
---
Use whatever gives you good stats to help with ranging. Leveling up new weapon proficiencies is rather quick, so if you find a weapon that has good stats but you need to learn the proficiency, then don't worry too much. For example, in the dungeon Uldaman there's a polearm that has +15 agility which I am interested in going for. I haven't learned polearms yet but if I did get the item then I would just go learn it and level it up quickly. 
---
Learning duel wielding is useful too because I was finding more weapons with good stats like Agility or + Attack Power than offhand items.
---
Its the same amount just that it affects only your spells in the frost school.
---
Shackle is always star. Shackle is just rare, so star can be used for sap. Personally I’ve always done condom sap, star shackle but to each their own.
---
Funny story, twice I've tried to break a stealthed NE hunter and kill them when I see their cat just sitting there - both times it was just a druid minding their own business.
---
Hello again. This is stored in \\WTF\\Accounts\\youraccountIDhere\\macros-cache.txt

Since version 3.x I think these are also synced to the cloud at each character logoff, you may not need to back them up at all but it couldn't hurt - not sure if that functionality is part of the new Classic client
---
How i choose to see it is for leveling, spirit is king. The + spellpower likely wont shave off even a single cast necessary to kill the mob but spirit will enable you to kill more mobs without drinking, making you level the fastest. So usually dont worry about SP gear until + for your prebis
---
Eating after each pull? I get your point but It's covered in bullshit too.
---
Love your site it is amazing. I use it to choose what i want for my char and see how much stats i have
---
I would love priest tanks. (Disc priests were supposed to be tanks)
---
It's been this in Private servers.
---
Keep at it. They're a bit of a slog at lower levels but absolutely worth it once you get to the finished product. And it fits pretty much all of your criteria. Rogue for life.
---
To be fair this is happening on my server. People selling silk cloth for 35s a stack (free money!), random herbs that are even high level going for silver/copper above vendor price. Hell, even oily black mouth is going for like 10s a stack.
---
I’d love it a lot more if I had more room in my bank. I’ve run like 4 characters to org and just have their banks full of cheap mats, but at this point I’m worried if the prices are ever even gonna rise
---
Yeah it's coming back down now. But I guess that was a huge spike when everyone hits 60. But it's still 2s each
---
Gratz man!
---
*everyone liked that*
---
You know that got changed years ago, right?  No, out course you didn't, incel.
---
You'll learn the spells and be able to use them more effectively with experience. Feeling overwhelmed sucks - until it all clicks.
---
If you think SL locks counter shadow priests, you clearly don't know what you're talking about.
---
Yeah, I will say it’s definitely a bit of a riskier play style. For instance if things don’t play out in the ideal way and you don’t get that charge off when there’s no rage saved up, you’re gimped quite a bit in those critical early seconds of the pull. And the obvious aspect of you taking more damage is there.i really like playing like this though since you do move a lot faster and it forces you to stay on your toes and really adapt when you can’t get sweeping or whirlwind off and dps starts pulling. You start looking at who can survive, where your healer is at, and get to make all sorts of crazy decisions based on that. I liken it to driving manual vs automatic, you may have to do a bit more work but it’s a lot more engaging and if you do it right it’s also slightly more efficient
---
Plus it was never fear but I’ve had to seduce/banish a handful of times like this
---
What addons is that that shows you all the auction info? I have the vendor one but what's the auction one??

Herod is a hot bag of toxic trash

What build are you using to get Natural Shapeshifter AND Nature's Swiftness?  Just not going so far down the feral tree?  Most videos I have seen say Heart of the Wild is a PvP must though.  Thanks!

and if we don't get no souls then we don't eat no rolls!
---
Wow you almost made me wake up the family laughing.
---
 top kek!
---
And Banish
---
This is good for the end consumer
---
Seriously don't call world pvp 1v1 a gank, just cause its a rogue and he's stealth doesn't make it a gank either. Stealth is part of their toolkit, without it they're the worst class.
---
An orc that doesn't KOS an elf? Disgrace!

The first is classic.

Imagining him being able to walk around a massive world... amazing.

“Practically all RP I’ve seen is spontaneous or pre-planned.”  You covered everything there, lol.  Also, PVE realms are never a good choice.

Not sure how to link! But the website is www.wowclassicbis.com

he said from his mud hut, surrounded by beasts and rotting corpses
---
I totally get you but I think that sort of change is for classic+. Just until AV is out, they will all regret rolling horde
---
Gnome racial is incredible with this many mages. Notice Apes anticipated this.
---
Out of spite no one will want to direct you to that...damn windfury...

Sap was always Star in my groups during Vanilla!

Take a look at drawfs. Then take another look at this shitpost.

Today I was leveling in Arathi highlands at school on my Mac book, after my last class , about an hour, I got home and started playing on my desktop, after about 4 hours I was disconnected and received a 30 day ban. I’m so confused, can I appeal this? I don’t understand what I did wrong. https://imgur.com/gallery/64ug4bj

Haha i just got it yesterday actually, too addicting.

Wholesome content like this should always be welcome. Naturally karma is a result of such wholesome and sad stories.

He looked so vunerable out in the Barrens alone lol there was no honour in that kill.
---
Would it be any different if a mage hits you with a surprise poly then starts his rotation? Just cuz Rogues use stealth doesn't make it a gank if its in the similar level bracket. Stealth is part of their toolkit and its how Rogues initiate every fight regardless of a gank or not.
---
The horde guilds wanted to stop them from going to the raid Molten Core.
---
Also the server they are playing on is very horde dominated.
---
Really not trying to brag.  I was pretty good at the class.  I just want something different now.  I started a hunter at Classic release and then decided I wanted something different.  I played from Vanilla launch through mid-TBC with a hunter main and then quit.  Came back a couple times, mostly Wrath and a month during Mists, and continued the hunter both times.  Love the hunter, just want something different.
---
What name bar addon are you using
---
Yeah but the first ten levels aren't all that hard. 1-5 is like an hour, and the next five are a few more after that.
---
Good job!  :)
---
so just specifically against undead, not just on horde
---
Rogue vs mage is pretty close to 50 / 50. Some people would even give mage the slight edge
---
Damn straight. Sure, I've failed to check my minimap to catch a patrol coming up from the rear. But I've also sent my snarling stomping monkey man after a mob that broke off for the squishy casters.
---
Escape artist and fear ward are definitely not dog shit.
---
That said yeah, there's a lot of aspects that could use tweaking/reworking. I don't think racials are the reason for the pvp imbalance though.
---
Why do you care so much about this?
---
Nice
---
I like that song you used :D do you have a name?

Try telling my girl that :(

I heal people in trouble and don't expect anything
---
All my hearthstones, send me to herr, timeless maage, stranger to conjured waaaaterrr
---
What about mind control ?
---
I played a rogue vanilla through cataclysm, and sap was always star.
---
Polymorph is square/blue and hunter trap is triangle/green.
---
Sap doesn’t have a dedicated one and neither does fear as it’s more of a panic cc since it can pull more. 
---
Circle/orange is pretty much never used either. 
---
Class colors (or as close as you get) for cc or gtfo.
---
Got that +20% mount speed though
---
Just tried to buy classic for the last two hours.  I'm getting the "Heads Up! Something went wrong" error over and over again as I try to add a card for payment, and yes, I've tried all the suggested fixes.  I've been buying games online for a very long time.  This is the first time a company is denying me from giving them money.  How can Blizzard afford to not accept money for hours on end?  Didn't they just have massive layoffs?
---
Get me off this train
---
Idk man you literally messaged a person looking for a confrontation. Idk how that makes you the good guy.
---
You were higher level than the rogue and you attacked him first. The only thing the rog was guilty of was being stealthed in a quest hub.
---
Kick is on the GCD IIRC although since Rogues have a 1.0sec GCD there's not much of an excuse.
---
lol so u wont play a class based off 1 tiny gripe? looks like  your not playing anything mate.
---
I just hit 60 and just respecced to prot. Tanked all instances as arms no problem.
---
I would stay arms as long as you can, as is it shit to quest in prot.
---
What do we know about phase 2?
---
This is not true there's horde everywhere. Cant even get into SM because they camp the entrance every night, all zones are flooded with horde. Forget STV, badlands ect, way too many horde. Trust me, whatever the numbers say its overwhelming horde presence everywhere.
---
It was 440 XP at level 47, even. I guess it required level 40 to accept from a drop off a yeti in Feralas but it still feels disappointing. :(
---
I know you are you what am I?!
---
Meta is keep being arms but put on a shield and 1h when tanking dungeons, use ur defensive abilities like sunder armor, revenge, taunt etc to tank.
---
Dwarf:
---
 
---
Stoneform - good for all classes in PvP and PvP.
---
Fear ward (priest racial) is arguably the best racial for any person picking a priest. Amazing in PvP.
---
Gnome:
---
Escape artist - similar to a free action potion but can break you out of a current slow/stop.
---
Expanded Mind is a nice little 5% bonus to intellect for mages and warlock.
---
Human:
---
Perception is not the best racial out there but can give Human rogues an advantage against other rogues.
---
Night Elf:.....
---
What do you mean?  It says the first image is the one from classic (now) the second image is original.  They changed the original shorts to mom shorts.
---
I assume you mean for the Alliance? Surprisingly the Paladin and Shaman while very different mirror each other pretty well. Paladin and Shaman are both great buffing and support classes. Paladin even have elemental resistance aura's similar to the shaman resistance totems. And ironically Ret and Enhance are both based on auto attack RNG. If you want Enhance Shaman on the alliance. Ret Paladin is your best bet. But remember you are a support role as a ret paladin so don't expect leet dps.
---
&gt;Could you explain the "pallies for raid dps"? Like more buffs for the raid instead of direct contribution?
---
Sure.  A Paladin in a raid is more likely going to be a healer or a trash tank.  A Ret Pally, if you want to go that route, is going to take some dedication on your part, but in 40 man content; there's no reason a guild wouldn't bring a ret pally along, and I'll tell you why...
---
Ret Pallies are the lowest DPS of the DPS classes.  If anyone is consistently below you in DPS, then they're doing something wrong.  That doesn't mean Ret Pallies suck; it means they're a hybrid class.
---
So like Shaman, A Paladin brings a benefit specific to the group it comes to.  It sacrifices it's own Melee DPS for not only the Auras they bring, but for the class specific buffs they can bring.  The Auras are group wide, so think of them like a single Totem you have strapped to your back all the time.  Concentration, Fire Resist, Shadow Resist, and Devotion Aura are probably the "go to" auras you have around you.  Blessings, unlike Shaman...  well, you can go raid wide with them.  Wisdom for casters, Might for Melee, Kings for Tanks, and clutch Sanctuary and Salvation if/when needed.
---
In a raid, everyone wants to go harder, move through content faster, push the envelope.  
---
Paladins are essentially the long lasting lubricant.
---
In the end, everyone will think it was all them; that their performance was an example of their "prowess".  In reality, it was the lube they used that stopped them from getting burned, chafed out, and so sore from the pounding that they had to stop.
---
When I first started playing back in 2008, I thought much as you did and chose Warrior as my first character. It was painful!
---
Fortunately, I was curious enough about other classes and had a lot of play time, so I tried almost everything and ended up with a shadow priest main and a mage and warlock close behind.
---
As others have said, I suggest you go with lock or hunter. They're relatively easy and can be super fun!
---
id say most of the time you need healer or tank to be mainspec or have your group outlevel the dungeon quite a bit. If the tank is arms/fury and the healer is an enhance shaman you are probably gonna have a bad time.
---
24-27 you can farm the furbolgs in the area to the northeast and southeast of Astranaar. You get a lot of wool and some linen also. Sometimes horde are in the northern part, if so just go south past the road to farm those ones until they leave.
---
Yeah, but why does that mean you need TBC instead if Classic+ which can also do all of those things?
---
Honestly I only use my gun to pull when I need to LOS groups of enemies out of a room to not get mobbed. Otherwise, charge in for the extra rage.
---
lol, this. Literally every gripe about each class is easily fixable
---
No one needs to spec for healing at all pre BRD. Long as you're int stacking instead of spell damage you're absolutely fine.
---
Can you give me some suggestions. I know nothing about building a PC. So build one that can run 1440p max settings.
---
Same here, I switch between my laptop and desktop when playing and got the same 30 day ban. Appealed the ban, but it was affirmed.
---
I think people are just smarter now, we've learnt from past mistakes. I was the same, never had any gold back in Vanilla but haven't struggled at al in Classic.
---
The abundance of resources available to people now, is a thousandfold since 2004. We now know what spells we can skip while leveling and the importance of vendoring trash items.
---
The absolute importance of upgrading bags can't be understated either. I know myself, back in Vanilla, I was level 60 and probably only had one 14 slot for a long while. In Classic I made it a priority to get all Runecloth bags as soon as possible. At only 2-3g each on my server, four of them paid for themselves in only a level or two.
---
Mine is actually quite similar. The only difference is that  I have both the DPS and the Threat meter in the same place as your DPS meter. They are simply side by side. It just felt more symmetrical to me I suppose.
---
Cool, thanks!  I may just go Nature's Swiftness then.  I wonder if I should go Natural Shapeshifter while leveling and then respec at 60?  Especially since I can't get Heart of the Wild until later in levels.
---
Thank you!  I will check these builds out!
---
All the talk of transfer or reroll to a balanced server... Neither is a good option. Blizz screwed their players.
---
Reroll? Sure, lets invest all this time again and just hope the imbalance doesnt happen again... or Transfer off to a server far more imbalanced in the opposite way and play pseudo-pve. Sure no restarting but you get nothing out of it long term outside of pure pve and the occasional gank.
---
Man I hope whoever was involved in the server transfers gets kidney stones for the rest of their lives &gt;.&gt;
---
Duh
---
Yea but with a good warrior tank it’s really a non issue.
---
Part of being a good tank is communication... stand here... please kill skull first... wait for me to pull back...
---
I’d say you can get 90% of groups to do what you want. The other 10% is “omg go faster” and then they pull and wipe me because I, literally, am pulling exactly how fast I can pull already. If you pull more, it’s too much. :/
---
No, when I was 13. A bit over 10 years ago during Wrath.
---
Resto is the truly fun Druid spec. I had way more fun in PvP and PvE on my Druid when I finally hit 60 and could go Resto. 
---
Really, really fun style of healing, disengaging and kiting.
---
Tank with a 2h wep you'll never get the rage you need tanking with a 1h and shield. 
---
I only ever stick my 1h and shield on when it's a hard hitting boss like Morgraine.
---
Nothing wrong with it if it is stated clearly and agreed upon BEFORE you go to dungeon. Personally I would do it in the message I send before invite.
---
Stop with this slippery slope shit, not everything leads to dungeon and raid finder. That's a complete paradigm shift for the game that resulted from a new lead dev.
---
And that's just a more hatebonering against flying mounts, which I yielded was a change in gameplay. But it is what vanilla is like too, you just like to pretend otherwise. In vanilla you spam every single public channel to get a group, then get on the flight path and fly there, then run on your mount for 2-5 minutes - replace flight path for flying mount and reduce travel time when you get to the dungeon, and you got TBC.
---
IDK what it is that YOU want for classic, but "we" clearly don't want the same thing. I want viable hybrids, actually workable PvP, actually engaging raids before the last couple of tiers, more activties for casual players beyond just 5-mans, twealed \[rpfessopns. etc. In all of those ways, TBC was the same design as vanilla, but much better seeing how the devs actually had experience now.
---
I wish I had the link, but someone got gkicked because he was tanking an instance and didnt see someone ding 60 in chat, officers lost it on him, lol
---
Ummmm... so the orange one... that's condom not circle!
---
UI stuff!
---
There are certainly some people who don't really get the *why* of it all, and end up advocating the same thing from different positions. People who only look to the lowest common denominator, while ignoring everyone else, are going to repeatedly be taken by surprise every time they encounter someone who truly understands and desires liberty though.
---
If they announce TBC I'm out. Not trying to play 15 years behind retail.
---
Some pointers:   
---
\- Demo shout works well for damage mitigation, but not very well for threat generation.  
---
\- Do not use overpower, as it shares a cooldown with Revenge. Revenge is, until Shield Slam, the most Threat-per-Rage-effective skill you've got. Use Revenge as often and as much as possible, it's as close as one can get to free threat.   
---
\- Don't waste all your rage on executions apart from possibly when nuking down a boss or when it's the final mob of a pull and you know there will be a mana break after. Save rage between pulls as much as possible.  
---
\- Battle shout generates threat when its buff is applied, not when the buff is up. It also generates threat depending on the amount of party members who got the buff. The threat is also divided between all mobs currently in combat with the buffed members of your party. It's situationally valuable if you stand on top of your party and hit all members of it, but not really valuable when charging away from them and into mobs alone.   
---
\- The main function of taunt is that it gives you equal threat to whoever is currently highest on the mob's threatlist. You piggyback on the DPS' threat basically.
---

on an RP server...
---
For max level SM/Ruin is the all around build. It's almost as high damage in raids as DS/ruin, and allows you to buff the tank with imp stamina buff. Meanwhile it's a very capable PVP build. Not as OP as SL/SL - but still pretty damn strong with some gear. 
---
For leveling I personally went into affliction until SL - and then into destro to get shadowburn - that meant that around lvl 41 I had become an absolute beast - with extra dots, a chance to proc nightfall, deathcoil AND shadowburn. That's absolutely disgusting at that level. It may not be the fastest build in terms of leveling, but I sure had a lot of fun with it.
---

---
When they start school and start using tablets or computers (possibly supplied by the school) they will have a learning curve just getting into the things, setting them behind the other kids who know how those things work already. 
---
Relying only on books for research papers works, but it will still severely limit what can be found for said research papers, being limited by what's at home or at the local library. being able to access the internet and electronics at home will let the kids grow into the world. 
---
The internet is a core part of society, and growing up without said parts is limiting. Together with the lack of TV and other modern media, the kids will end up socially stunted. 
---
While everyone and their dog having a phone isn't a development I necessarily agree with, you are not doing your kids a favour by excluding those aspects of their lives. Yes, they are all younger than 5, but they need to know and understand how that these things exist and how they work. I'm not saying substitute your parenting for a tablet with an internet connection, but have limited access, perhaps a filter or a limited time per day, unless school work is being performed. While many of today's adults grew into how electronics work, the way society is today kids need to be around them from an early time to understand. They can't start at the same age adults did, as it'll be starting the race many years too late.

---
Had the complete opposite experience. Been selling greens on the AH non stop from dungeons, it's been AMAZING gold. I already almost have enough for mount and im level 30.
---
&gt; Generally you dont want to preemptively shield warriors
---
This stops being a rule once you are fighting things that can chunk a shield in a single blow. You will run into this on certain dungeon bosses, and most raid encounters. In these examples, your tank will be gaining enough rage from hits that shielding them will not matter, and will go a long way towards keeping them alive!
---
No problem there.
---
Of course if its a PvE server you can have characters on both sides on the same account.
---
Lol thanks, i missed it
---
What did you pay for your Warden Staff? Having trouble selling mine and there are never fewer than four in AH at a time.
---
It's still an exploit, they don't want to fix it or induce mass disciplinary actions for it.  Eventually layers will be removed.  It is not originally part of classic, and it requires manipulating the system in order to gain an advantage.  Also known as an exploit.

No. The majority of humans are idiots and will make idiotic choices. Just look at politics. I don't trust the majority of players to vote for things that would be good for the game.

Am I 15 years ago you? Swap high school for work and it’s bang on ha. Also, should get the skates back on my dude!
---
Marks are quite important on retail you know, even more the ones on floor
---
Apart from casting Battle Shout I agree with this. I don't think the threat Battle Shout generates when cast on only yourself, then divided between 3-4 enemies, is worth the 10 rage. Anyone will overtake your threat on those mobs.   
---
Tabbing sunders and using revenge off cooldown is sadly the best we get.   
---
A neat trick you can do if you got mocking blow off cooldown and you're about equal - a bit higher than the mobs (so you know they are unlikely to resist taunt) is to go in and start applying sunders to all enemies but one.   
---
When the sunder-free mob (the one you've generated basically no threat to at all) inevitably starts running back you simply taunt it, and now whatever threat was needed to break away from your initial pull has become equal to yours. Basically you piggyback off of someone else's threat when you use Taunt, and that's pretty darn useful.
---
Atleast he is honest.
---
I have a name like this on my server, HateMyGFsCat, and people love it. Half the PMs I get are people telling my name made them laugh. Now I said like that, but I think there is a class difference here. My SN is humorous, and not trying to be edgy. Edgy = Douche Baggery.
---
Name your character whatever you want, class is optional, but if you're naming your toon to push buttons, you'll get reported.

Been lvling in elem build ever sincee lvl 30 and nevet had any issues. Fire spells are mana hungry thats true. But when you see that juicy crit for 1k+ ignite at lvl 53 it just feels so much more satisfying than frost:)

A level 20 undead rogue tried to gank me, a level 28 paladin, as I was fighting a lvl 32 murloc in Hillsbrad. He backstabbed me and brought my health down even lower than it already was, but as soon as bubble + Holy Light brought me back to full health and half mana the little fucker ran off.
---
Just world PvP to rank up.
---
but it's classic D:
---
This is always true, especially against Majordomo.
---
What’s the ratio of “increases spell power by “x” to intellect? At what point does on supersede the other? I’m a frost mage if that helps.
---
Because players know what's best for them and the game...
---
What am I looking at?
---
Somewhat agree. Not sure if my clueless self at the age of 12 was that bad at making gold, but gold is definitely not that hard to come by. Currently, at lvl 45 I'm sitting at 220g and I've spent some.
---
did you expect that someone who lives in a fucking jungle with only some basic huts has loads of money ?
---
&gt; Skull - This guy's dangerous! Do not engage!
---
No shit, I did a dungeon just a few days ago where the tank would mark a skull on every pull. Naturally, I'd focus that one down only to almost immediately get aggro and suddenly notice that I was the *only* one attacking it. Tank wouldn't it even pull it off me, so I got to kill it on my own while the rest of the party was off doing their own thing. After this happened 3 times in a row I asked, "Are we not attacking skull?" Tank said yes. Like, wtf, who are these people and why do they insist on doing things backward.
---
I went holy and have a lot of +healing gear, mostly cloth. If I wanted to switch to prot what gear do I shoot for? +STA plate?
---
Currently level 42.
---
Nah. Go away.
---
Same.  I go by icon color = class color.  Star is sap, Condom is sleep (druid), etc etc.
---
No, becuase then you would end up with current WoW.
---
Possibly the Tauren place on the southwest tip of Silithus?
---
Aither SP or lock

Stupid Uldaman
---
Your bubbles completely diminish our rage.
---
So does he move around? And what sort of respawn timer does he have? I might work on a hunter and it would be cool to know what I would be getting into
---
I use the F1-F6 buttons and it also works quite well in combat
---
Burn it to the ground
---
100% agree.  If only there were an AH, it'd.be perfect.
---
trolls don't sleep.
---
Awesome thanks, will do \^\^

It’s not underrated, it’s just in the middle of A FUCKING TREE IN THE OCEAN AS AN ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

---
To be fair it sounds cool despite making no sense.
---
It’s pretty, but lacks pretty much any utility
---
Submitted bug report
---
Kind of gray territory.
---
Sure, capitalism means people can sell whatever the market will bear. But people sometimes also tend to look at the market and make judgements about the people involved.
---
In this case, the buyers are a bunch of (probably) very lonely, desperate, men with more money than sense. The seller seems to be insinuating that in buying her products, it gets you more of a chance to gain her affections. In any case, it feels like the guys are being taken advantage of by a woman who wouldn't normally give them the time of day, much less the kind of attention she insinuates that she's selling.
---
So it feels like people are being taken advantage of, and (possibly) a lot of redditors can either relate to that or just want to take pity on the poor morons buying this stuff.
---
The 461 dps I'm assuming? More than likely due to AoE.
---
It seems regional, rarely see it on EU, we use /w me
---
Intellect doesn't increase spell damage, it increases total mana and spell crit chance. So they aren't directly comparable. But spell damage is more important than int.
---
I remember not even getting my first gold piece till like my late level 20s or something in vanilla 
---
what the fuck was I doing with all my money
---
&gt;If you read the letter, it's pretty much the real letter, just reworded to sound like it came from the world of Azeroth.

---
Can you print this and scan it and then upload it
---
I'm level 50 and only just now replaced Herod's shoulder, tho I keep it in the bank for nostalgia's sake.
---
you rerolled because of a minor bug? thats on u
---
Nothing that can’t be fixed with a couple of flight masters or some gnome teleportation device though.
---
Ty very much.
---
Good luck taking a picture like this with your 2005 flip phone.
---
are those bosses fearable? if it is i might chance to kill them solo(i even soloed that big 61 lvl elite worm, it took my 10 minutes lol)
---
otherwise i guess i will look for a group. i did got the first amulet out of those 3 bosses with a group, i was lucky that they were just about to start it.
---
You can heal everything until the second half of brd as shadow.  Golem lord and everything past him is a little tricky but with a good group you can heal the rest as shadow tbh.  People have even healed lbrs/ubrs/scholo/strat as shadow just fine, really just depends on your group.
---
We know it will add the Dire Maul dungeon, Azuregos and Kazzak world bosses and the PvP Honor System and Rank Rewards.  
---
They haven't said when it's going to be released but most people seem to think it will be about 3 months after launch
---
It looked so profound until I read the pet name.
---
i could be dumb
---
I think its is a few different things contributing to our ingame wealth. On the other hand I didn't get my mount until level 44 but I maxed all my professions. Having Ghostwolf didn't make the mount as much of a priority.
---
Everybody is wiser and more knowledgeable now on what sells and what to vendor.
---
The player base is slightly better skill wise so content is getting cleared quicker so you see alot more drops. 
---
People are skipping alot of the less useful skills from the trainer now that they know they are poo.
---
The populations per server are vastly greater than they were in vanilla so you can peddle your wares on the AH alot easier.
---
I've started tanking with 2h and find it way easier to hold aggro. I mostly stuck to sword and shield for the first 35 levels but I've recently converted. Both can be effective it just comes down to personal skill and preference.
---
There is an AH.
---
Fuck that, use whatever and tell the group what ur thinking
---
So basically it’s an auto attack class with some totem shit. The basic idea behind enh shaman is buff your wep, put down some totems, and whack things to death. It’s considered the best leveling spec for shaman because unlike ele you don’t have to spam spells to do damage so you end up spending less time sitting/ drinking waiting for mana. It’s better leveling then resto because, if it’s not obvious, leveling as a healer is garbage tier. End game it’s easily the worst spec, relying on RNG wind fury procs + crits to do huge damage, although it’s not totally unviable it’s just not as good as resto for group play and ele for dps. If you have perfect gear and try for hours you can make a “sweet” compilation video of you one shotting people in PvP, again with perfect procs + crits, but over all it’s mostly a “ for fun “ class end game.
---
Ok
---
Ok honestly I didn’t think he’d be able to play it so well, what a legend! I’m gonna need updates on his progress
---
We Zelda now
---
No, let's forget about it.
---
Well you can play any role with just about any spec until maybe your 40s or 50s so I wouldn’t worry too much about it tbh
---
You don't even have cat form until level 20... dont worry about it for a while.

Plenty of people like you and myself did take pto to play and I'm sure some one somewhere got fired for missing or being late to work for wow BUT this story reads and feels like a piece a fiction.  It's not like the behavior of making up stories for karma/entertainment is an unheard of thing

What do YOU mean? He said that in before / after comparisons, the 'before' image should be on the left (which makes sense, since we perceive time moving from left to right). In this image, the 'before' picture is on the right.
---
Is it worth it to disenchant blues and greens and sell the materials? Or should I just vendor blues and greens
---
First mount !
---
Fax it to me first.
---
i was moreso impressed due to the fact that there were 2 other mages of the same level in the group with me, plus im not speced for aoe. just really lucky crits on a big pull and i was happy about it
---
The skinning/mining is for money.... the herb alchemy is because both the mage and the warrior benefit from it hugely.
---
The warrior will definitely wan healing pots. The mage will definitely want mana pots. You can also then use the other rpotions that give stuff like +str, +armour etc.
---
Multishoooooot
---
Good luck bro !
---
Natedog lol
---
I’ve also really enjoyed a very similar como. One whammy healer, two warriors and one mage and whatever else we need to fill out the como. The split tanking the warriors do stacks with the windfury and then there’s whatever AOE. It’s super nice to have two taunts too and really helps the group feel more balanced and not like a glass cannon while still having pretty strong AOE
---
I did skin/LW on my hunter and pushed really hard to get tribal leatherworking early on, which caused me to not have a mount until 48. I’d say crank out those gathering professions. Maybe level skinning to vendor the materials for money, and level mining and save the materials in the bank so you can quickly level engineering later on. I was really disappointed with leatherworking and skinning at 300 because of “devilsaur mafias” controlling all of the best leather in the game and no real way to make good gear, so I dropped skinning at level 60 today and picked up mining. I’ll soon drop LW and pick up engineering for PvP stuff, or maybe just sell the mining mats.
---
played wow thousands of hours and only ever had one character max leveled at 80.  more alts than i can remember.  good job triggering the snowflakes.

They don't like PvP, they like wrecking other peoples days and feeling like they're good.
---
To each their own, but I prefer a fight where if I win I know it's because I was better.
---
That was sick as fuck
---
I make groups for level 60 dungeons multiple times every day and I never ask or care what spec somebody is.
---
You can trade it for thorium brotherhood rep. You should never vendor it
---
Gratz my dude!
---
Why do you think they don't?
---
I enjoy the grind. Soon as I get 3/4 way through a level I just grind it out. I find it weirdly enjoyable... I am a huge vanilla fan and played and raided the entire time and it’s the only Warcraft I know
---
yes 1,5 levels, to reach this point it takes 30 days
---
No
---
Also note: this is basic until noted otherwise by raid or dungeon group. LEARN 2 COMMUNICATE!
---
Almost always. 50s or a gold is worth way more to a lowbie than an extra couple bag slots.
---
It's a simple concept of greed, and it's super antisocial imo
---
Blizzard did the right thing, full story at eleven. I'd have reported your name myself if I saw it. Grow up.
---
You need to kill either Lord Incendius in BRD, Pryoguard in UBRS or anything in MC.
---
That is nice. Probably use that when I get more aspects. Only lvl 26 right now.
---

---
Hands down the most fun of rogue world PvP is stalking and taking down one from a group then disappearing only to put down another moments later. 
---
Really fun if you time things properly.
---
I tank PUGS as a bear and the DPS avoids skull more often than not. 
---
I've watched them through target-of-target as they switch off skull as soon as I mark it.
---
Maybe they think it's dangerous because it has a skull?
---
Helcular’s Sword/rod. It’s definitely 100x worse than this.  It took me at least 40 yeti kills and a dozen pvp encounters.
---
That cave is littered with bodies of horde and alliance alike.
---
To make matters worse, once you complete that you get sent RIGHT BACK to light the flames which itself can be an arduous task with the amount of pvp going on in there.
---
Fuck that quest.
---
You have to tame a pet that has the ability you want, then use the ability until you can teach it to other pets.

---
Or just specify that it's a res run and people will decide for themselves?  No need to make blanket statements when there's plenty of people out there who couldn't care less about a reserved item.
---
You gotta swap between it, usually using 2 hander when you have rage to dump on Ss cleaves in def stance, stance dancing to manage threat.  When you get to stuff that hits too hard then you swap back to sword and board.  As long as you correctly utilize the threat from def stance for your cleaves, 2 hand is fine.
---
Ich werde ihn besuchen, finde ich echt mega. :D
---
They are still used. Even on TBC and WOTLK priv servers. Say tbc swp mote runs those all are used all the time.
---
Was frustrated with it and I’m not in a hurry to 60. Thanks for letting me know tho.
---
iirc its 50% more xp from mob kills
---
You are aware that the [Victim Card] is an on-use item which gets consumed in the process?
---
You can heal fine. I heal as shadow and have only ever had issues in Stratholme.
---
Yea he was just lurking around innocent and used "Cold blood" just accidently
---
I'm MOSTLY against player changes BUT....I wouldn't be against players having the power to suggest quest lines. Currently hordies will effectively be LIVING in the Barrens for a fair amount of levels, and the quests there aren't the best. In fact even leveling orc or troll is not that great, their starting area quests need work (which is why I just moved my orc to Tirisfal to quest in). Alliance side quests (humans and I believe also NEs) have far better questlines. I wouldn't be against the community coming up with ideas for questlines and then voting for which ones they'd love to see get added to the game. Horde side really does need much love.
---
Uh, no we don't perceive time moving from left to right.
---
We read from left to right and so it makes sense to chronologically order things the same, but it has nothing to do with how we perceive time. It's just convention.
---
Thanks for your detailed reply!
---
So Enhancement is ok until I reach the endgame. Then it sucks, because it is very RNG dependend. Correct?
---
[xpoff.com](https://xpoff.com) will likely have most of the information you are looking for.
---
Yeah, star was always sap on my server when I was a rogue.
---
We used tells in EverQuest..
---
We *had* a priest for a while. Then he rerolled mage. :c we're in the process of trying to find another healer in the 40s area. So if any healers on Benediction-Horde see this, HMU.
---
Im going to do this with runescape font
---
Yeah, I finished it in a half hour, the lessers and the normals. There were 4 other people grinding it out too. With the fast spawn timers it’s no biggie.
---
If its any consolation it will be worth a fair amount in a few months when people are past saving for mounts and working on 2nd/3rd alts. Just mail it back and forth between your bank and main.
---
How much they've perfected the meta is really something to admire; if only there was an equally competent pvp group to oppose them to make things really interesting.
---
Game is super boring at 60 without BGs/honor titles. Farming super old dungeons over and over and boring easy 40 man raids is a joke....
---
It's not racials that make horde win "world" pvp.
---
It's numbers.
---
If Horde had so many OP racials they'd dominate every arena bracket in BC, which they most definitely did not.
---
Oh weird. My combat log didnt say anything either
---
only if you are snowflake, otherwise you would forget about this game in few days
---
HYPE
---
I bet you're fun at parties
---
As a healer I put the star on the tank because he is the star in our group. Also to see better where the hell he is.
---
It's attack on eye sight cos people are dumb. But it actually means area of effect and I believe spell cleave refers to somebody most likely a mage who is going to do a lot of aoe to progress faster
---
If you are of average skill I'd say shadow priest will give you the best results without having to put in a ton of work. However, there is no class that can outlast a properly played Soul Link Warlock. The spec is so insanely overpowered that the Soul Link talent gets banned from 1v1 duel tournaments for the sake of fairness. Check out the [Henhouse 1v1 Tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-THDdQepm-A&amp;t=16416s) to see what a high level fight in the matchup looks like.
---
You should concede your entire point as Mindflay is cheaper mana wise at max rank, than a mages frostbite.
---
only for the first 3 because fire literally doesn't do damage to about half the bosses in Molten core and BWL
---
One could assume it will be around 3 months after launch. Vanilla released in November 2004 &amp; Dire Maul was added February 2005.
---
yep, or do incendius or pyroguard in brd/ubrs
---
try and get one of those done before you go to MC next, as the next quest is to get drops from the 4 snake guys.
---
Yes. Certain mobs will only grant rep up til a certain point. Anything from honored up will require clearing MC trash and bosses or  the 2 fire elemental bosses in 60 dungeons (one in BRD and one in UBRS)
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/faction=749/hydraxian-waterlords
---
Here's link to a list and info on the rep.
---
Really you should be using def stance to cleave and rage dump, outside of starting off with charge and ss in battle, and a ww in zerker when you need.  The threat difference between def and battle/zerker is around 65%, even untalented.  Stance dancing is what makes great warriors shine.
---
based and redpilled
---
Spell cleave is just a term people are using in classic to specify they want to use casters to aoe. Since theres melee cleave and spell cleave groups happening constantly, it a lot easier than referring to it all as AoE
---
This
---
What kinda bullshit is that even
---
While hunter is nice there is nothing better, then constantly spamming faerie fire on sight on all rogues. Few years ago in small private server i was playing wsg with 4 enemy rogues and they never touched me since we made a deal i wont faerie fire them :-D
---
Nice kill. I'll be honest I was expecting you to be fighting a mob at low HP when it happened, but congratulations nonetheless.
---
I've been farming Herod for days now. I have three axes and many pairs of pants. No shoulders. :c
---
Oh! I see, thank you! I'v been wanting to get a Wind Serpent, or another Owl but with abilities. So I just go into the wild and fight owls until I see them do the abilities? And tame them whenever I see that they did use the ability?
---
If you have some confidence in the person who wants to lead that's one thing. I wouldn't tank a PUG that won't pass lead.
---
You can easily heal brd with spriest spec. I literally run this dungeon with an spriest as heal while I tabk this as furor with 2 1h.
---
Can I ask you something else? I'm a level 44 warrior and I find myself becoming very weak. It takes out all the fun of a warrior. One mob kills me for about 40% of my hp. And that is done by a mob 2 levels lower then me in feralas. I'm fully arms spec with most SM pieces of gear and the Ravager. 
---
What do you think might help at this point? Swap a talent? Get better gear? Change my weapon?
---
I’m having a hard time deciding between priest and Druid. The little time I did play wow (during the end of pandaria) I played resto Druid and it was fun, but I’ve always liked the idea of a bubble priest. Levelling is a little bit painful on my priest though (only level 21 so far) I’ve never tried shaman heals. If anyone has any insight that would be great.
---
Sounds like you have a short attention span and you don’t enjoy the dynamic of the game. The grind is exactly the same at level 1 as it is at level 59. It’s all about the journey and the higher the level the more the game wants you to
---
Journey to different lands to tell story’s that span continents and bring the lore of the game together. If you think the game is a grind it’s because your choosing to play it that way.  And are playing like a mindless drone who doesn’t pay attention to the lore or quest. I have yet to ever grind anything and I’m level 58. In the end it just sounds like you don’t enjoy the game and that’s fine but I don’t appreciate how you chose to word your shitty opinion because it comes across in a manner that you want every one else to feel the same way you do. Try getting more into the lore of the game or at least farther then level 30. Or don’t play, video games are entirely pointless if you don’t enjoy it.
---
Ha .... gay!
---
Zerk and battle are .8 threat modifiers, while def is 1.3 without the prot talents.  So 1.3/.8 is over 60% increase in threat being in def vs the other two.
---
Not sure why you were downvoted since you’re totally right. Unless they have separate BGs for PVE and PVP (Waah waah the PVE people can level faster and get gear) which they don’t need to, everything will be fine if the global population is relatively even.
---

Sharing for skill ups is usually just between friends or people you're partied with.  
---
I offered to share with a random once because I was fighting next to a node, he ran up and asked if I was about to mine it then was happy to leave when I said yes. Offered to let him hit for skill up because he'd done the right thing by me but he declined. Nice dude.
---
? You never played wow in vanilla/tbc I guess?
---
they gave her some upgraded thot gear

With this set you can even raid homelander!

---
hunters need on all the gear that drops  
---
priests become healers and heal everything  
---
occasionally a druid gets lucky and is feral in a raid but usually becomes a healer, mainly in raids for innervating priests and brezing tanks
---
I got this one.
---
Cata PvP was garbage and MoP PvP was amazing. The end.
---
But if you’re curious, the popular cleaves that popped up in Cata and MoP were:
---
Jungle cleave: feral, hunter, healer, usually Disc iirc
---
Kung fu cleave: warrior hunter healer
---
Thug cleave: rogue hunter healer 
---
Turbo cleave: enhancement, warrior, healer, usually Hpal for HoJ iirc
---
while 1v&gt;2 technically is PvP, thats is probably not the type of PvP he had in mind when he rolled on a PvP server.
---
I know it is an odd concept, but people are generelly not fond of being beaten up by multiple people simultaneously.
---
....?
---
Any healer guide points out the most mana effecient heal spells, and it's rarely max rank (never, in my reading).  You heal with the efficient spell until the damage taken means you need to use your max rank.
---
Or just keep any meat you kill in the wild. I’ve had a cat since level 10 (now in my 40s) and have never had to fish or buy any meat for feeding. I’ve occasionally had to sell meat because it takes up so much bag space after a while.
---
Sexy time
---
Out of curiosity - what item? (Not that it affects the answer, just wondering)
---
But yet I heal max level dungeons on ele 0 problem at all
---
flattered that you think it's a screenshot (suck it apple users), but i just took a pic of that part of the screen. i was just happy because it's my highest dps so far in classic and im not out of level range for the instance
---
CPU issue or maybe a weird network issue, get a wired connection and reset your router

I just worded my question as such because based on other comments, people are saying she had short shorts last week, but was changed sometime this week. That’s what lead me to believe someone in Acti/Blizzard changed it.

---
You have to replace spells when you train them, lol  
---
Also, you may find that low rank spells are useful in some cases
---
your healers mana bar is also a resource - I would argue your primary one.  The whole point of being a tank is taking less damage per hit than the rest of the party.

---
i prefer to think they just return to the wild.  it wasnt an ability pet but i took my turtle back to the barrens oasis where i got him.  he probably bit another player shortly afterwards and was killed but i tried.
---
Deciding you don't like something of your own will is completely different than deciding that nobody else should be allowed to like it either.
---
tyvm
---
You know what, to be honest i am not at all envious.  Like if i want to just AoE grind i can just play retail.    But i for some reason enjoy 1vs1-2 a lot more, no matter what class i play.  I gues it is because they feel like individual fights and not like a grind.
---
I got killed by douches when I was leveling, so I will definitely slap a noob while im running past them.

I love bgs, I'm on a pve server because I find world pvp to just be an annoyance a lot, as I like to pvp when I want to pvp. I've heard that cross realm bgs are a thing immediately which I'm not happy about, as pve server players will have significantly less experience going in, hell some with next to no honor as wotld pvp rarely occurs.
---
wait till you get past Scarlet Monestary
---
I wish
---
What are you playing it on?
---
&gt; would be cool to know what I would be getting into
---
Broken Tooth, at least for now, is very likely to be heavily contested unless you're hunting at like 3 am in the morning and just so happen to line up with his respawn timer. Some people luck out, but I have yet to see him at all after a couple of passes through the Badlands, despite seemingly at least once or twice being in the area when someone captured him.
---
The main benefit is for PvP due to the fast attack speed and limited options on alternatives until later phases. For PvE there isn't that huge of a difference between pets  of the same type, the damage roughly ends up the same in the end. There's a case to be made for Frenzy, but really most not slow pets can do fine with it anyways and it requires heavy investment into Beast Mastery, whereas for groups Marksmanship and wolves instead of cats or other creatures are preferred at the top end.
---
guess that's why they named it that
---
Yep there it is.
---
The most efficient heal is always your max rank heal when leveling up.
---
You need a lot of +healing to make downranking worth it.
---
Yeah so I'm pretty sure this is the reason all the healers on reddit are talking about mana issues lol, there is a huge amount of wrong/misunderstood info out there.
---
This happened on private servers a lot too
---
This guy knows
---
In what situations do you want to dismiss your pet?
---
That’s the best looking kodo IMO
---
I always matched with class color
---
Yellow star for yellow rogues
---
Blue box for blue mage
---
Orange nipple for orange druid
---
Green diamond for green hunter
---
Purple nurple for purple warlock
---
Moon was a catch all someone CC this
---
Skull for first burn target, X for second burn.

I had a problem of mouse drift previously, but it was the vibration from the speakers that caused it. Changing mouse pad to something softer helped with this.
---
I think he meant if you get a piece of paper and make as timeline with an order of events, the event that happened first will be on the furthest to the left and the event that happened last will be on the furthest to the right.
---
I think I PvP'd him in Ashenvale.
---
If you want to be really annoying, there are some terrifying 39/49 twink builds that just dominate, and most people wont put the time/gold in to get to that point as a twink
---
No one is running around with a full set of gear in their precious bag space swapping out between mobs to get mana. That's fucking asinine.
---
Ha, seems fake.  
---
Rougues don't attack higher levels than they are and only attack if you are already hurt ;)
---
[This](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_6jfJDb8HXCDGK)  would be more than enough for WoW classic and a bunch of other modern games if you want to just click buy and have it all work. It’s $749 on Amazon Warehouse Deals (i Buy everything from Warehouse Deals if available. Have yet to have anything defective).
---
Often we used triangle for an off tank target. Did you guys use it for something else?
---
I'm actually glad there are no BGs. It helps world PvP and I wish it would stay like that
---
Next goal : screenshot
---
APES is such a cool guild.
---
The tap doesnt cause agro the heal over time spell that ticks after you tap is what pulls the agro.
---
this comment def did not make me choke up at all
---
You sound like pwned caster tbh
---
druid is top class for leveling pvp
---
There are whole areas of TBC inaccessible without flying. Taking it out isn't a straightforward fix.
---
Only for low levels though.  At higher levels every dps knows you always hit the target your tank is attacking no matter what.
---
Are you counting holy fire as a dot?
---
Why do ppl want this pet... Is it for raids? Best pve pet for lvl is the Owl.
---
Educate me!
---
thank you so much!
---
I'm sure a lot of people would be interested in TBC/Wrath. Obviously no one is going to have exact #s on anything like this because that's impossible. But we're on the classic subreddit with very pro-vanilla people so any impression you get here likely isn't going to be a good representation of all WoW players.
---
There is also TSM but that's little crazy level.
---
You have desktop app synced with server and other people with addon. 
---
 It tracks average prices on your realm and when you are posting it checks if you are under average and you should post later on. It can also search items below average realm price and snipe them
---
You need the Gnomregan Exiles rep to Honored to get the rep discount to 90.
---
If you're struggling to find quests that give rep(Any quest that gives rep with a given Alliance Faction, so Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus or Gnomregan Exiles, will give you a quarter of that rep with all the other.)
---
You can turn in cloth to Bubulo Acerbus for extra rep, if need be.
---
So idk if it's still like this but I managed to jump through the back window on the boat as it was pulling away and landed on the bed, so maybe try that
---
Sounds like Hunter. Pet attack, hunters mark, serp sting on one button. Auto attack until dead. Repeat. Ez
---
exactly, it's funny how they try to blame the tank.  like sure I COULD fight all of you tooth and nail and drag you kicking and screaming through the instance and make it through eventually...
---
or I could drop your sorry asses and go run through in half the time with a competent group.
---
The number of dps who think damage meters is how you sort good dps from bad is laughable. 
---
If I have a rogue who takes down the skull reliably, and one who targets his own private squishy every time so he can more easily manage his combo points, and pwn the meters... the latter is going on the ignore list, and the former the friend.
---
Wanted to share the excitement with you guys. I have achived 2 out of few goals i set for myself in classic. Hit level 60 and get my epic mount. In vanilla i had to pvp to rank 11 to get my epic mount \`couse i didnt knew how to make gold to buy one. 
---
Sorry for photo quality.
---
Welcome to classic. They don't change automatically because downranking is a thing, though mostly for healers.
---
LPT: Casting banish on a banished target ends the banish effect.
---
Even as a rogue, there are these fucking invisible guys that see through stealth and then you got 4 skeletons, 7 ghouls, 12 abomination and 48 banshees on yo ass
---
*laughs in wisp form*
---
Neverlucky?

Oh look, another boat post...

it's what I do until WW comes off CD

LOve it, great work!

i like it when someone is nice enough to kill me close to a grave yard.
---
and thank you.  i was wondering a bit when i came back after a long flight path from badland to booty to find my guy dead.
---
For people who don't enjoy questing, are dungeon runs way to go.
---
I don't even mention it and just make sure I'm out of shadowform before I accept the group invite.

I just went through this entire comment thread and I'm genuinely impressed at how poor your grasp on the situation is. The character is named Daisy. She *was* wearing Daisy dukes, that is the reference. OP is not making a strawman, he is literally explaining the situtation to you. But rather than comprehend the very basic premise that has been laid out to you, you've decided to call people that wear daisy dukes slutty, and ignore the entire reference situation. Instead you've opted to decide that the reason people are upset about this is because they now have less material to masturbate to??
---
The reference was changed. Either because nations with stricter content policies wanted it that way, or because people like yourself didn't want "slutty" content in the game. Either way, the reason for the change is outrageous. The reference is perfectly fine. Wearing short shorts is perfectly fine. There is nothing wrong with dressing a certain way, most of my female friends own and wear daisy dukes. You're going around telling people to seek help, while broadcasting that you think that the *only* reason people would possibly be happy about this reference is because they want to jerk off.
---
They changed the model for what is more than likely political reasons. That is disgusting. You do not cover up women's bodies because some sexist foreign power prefers it that way. It doesn't matter that its a few pixels, it's about having principles. If she was wearing tit armor or a fucking thong that'd be one thing, but wearing normal-ass pants is completely fine and the only people that have problems with that are people who aren't worth listening to in the first place.
---
pc opinion terror.
---
Druids, priests, shamans etc can do it as efficiently as hunters and Warlocks. Everyone can do it so that they hit the instance resets / hour mark. Mages may have harder time since no insta cast dot and warriors / rogues / paladins can't obviously solo it, but the rest classes can quite comfortably get the run done.

its a joke idiot lol

Hahaha
---
I don't think people know that ele has no healing bonuses, they just assume spellcaster= heal
---
should be common sense for melee to not try to kill mobs over your level
---
I mean we're all just guessing. I just think TBC makes more realistic business sense for them, even though I think classic+ could be cool. It's already made so it's a lot less work, and it's a guaranteed money maker vs. something that's a bit risky. I wouldn't mind being wrong, but I think we will get TBC.
---
I'm leveling a Fury war with the intent on tanking dungeons. Is it better to use 1h or 2h?
---
global warming man! plus she's holding a torch! we don't want her to sweat....
---
I think it'd be popular.
---
Free protein!
---
That guy looks like an retail player. You can easy heal every dungeon as a shadow priest . Same way like the arms warri is tanking a dungeon without tank specc....

Yesterday a level 52 shadowpriest molested me, a level 60 hunter in prebis and giantstalker.
---
I was fucking around in wpl and killed a horde nearby, and was on 1/4th mana but full health. Dude opens on me with typical plague and swp, I blow my load and viper sting but its not quite enough. Pet is dead I'm down to auto shot only. He mcs me and runs me into range of fear, fears me and bandages, gets just enough mana to put swp on me again and wands me down. 
---
Always fight back, you never know how the dice will roll.
---
Paladin tier set is pretty good for pvp for holy pallies  I plan to use it whenever I'm not raiding or in a dungeon.
---
sounds like serverlag
---
or intended feature to reproduce authentic vanilla serverlag
---
That suggests that a third of the playerbase or something use paid services once a month. Which seems high.
---
i enjoy any vid that isnt about politics....and im playing wow atm so id prob watch or listen to yours.
---
especially if you made them different then most others.  like some said maybe the worst spots to farm or something off the beaten path.
---
Goal 3 is gonna be print screen
---
Why didnt they fly to searing gorge? Was this just a PvP raid group that was targetting horde?
---
Goddamn who even has 390g atm, which server?
---
Could anyone recommend good macro for marking targets using numpad numbers?
---
Drain tanking makes you feel like a god, unkillable, unstoppable, draining the life and souls from your enemies. Grinding thistleshrubs in tanaris to level 48-50 while drain tanking was a blast, only had to stop to drink maybe 4 times overall while averaging ~40k Xp/hr. If you wanna grind while leveling this is the ultimate spec.
---
Resto Druids/Arms Warrior was the most OP thing for 99% of BC
---
I just wanted to say we have the same convocation keybind :)
---
Well the OP was talking about food and water, so your comment on bandages makes no sense, unless you're talking out of combat healing
---
its the mana problem, there are ways to gear it so that its less of an issue, but you don't get that sort of thing levelling, so in all honesty its a bit of a weakness during that phase of the game.
---
usually people who Balance druid re-spec into it at 60, its really good in PvP since Druid can keep distance really well. Pve its not as good as Feral DPS but its not much worse, just more consumable heavy. At least you wouldn't have to go farm gnomeragan weapons endgame for BiS, and you get some AoE

Yea sorry. I recorded a video at home but when i wanted to upload i realised its too big, so i took a photo fast and rushed to work.

A fantastic city with fantastic music inside of a fantastic forrest.  There is absolutely nothing about Darnassus that i do not love.    
---
As my first town i ever set foot in in WoW, i have very special memories to it.  And i will be revisiting once i get a NElf alt going on.   
---
Night Elves have a great bunch of zones, Teldrasil, Darkshore, Ashenvale are such atmospheric zones.
---
People when for tier gear because the set bonuses were so strong.  For example, the mage T2 8piece bonus was so good, you needed to collect quite a lot of additional pieces of non-tier gear before it was good enough to break it...
---
The problem is I've done this shit, over and over. My fun is at 60 friend.
---
I used ravager until I snagged Gatorbite. Uhm it does get rough, and maybe the SM pieces aren’t that great anymore. You can wear plate so I would suggest trying to get some from RFD and ZF. They’re both great xp farms too, so you can get a little further ahead in levels and gear.
---
looking for a hunting partner to sit with amd sic our pets on alliance while they make the last run into sm.  they seem to move faster with something nipping at their heels.  hehe

Thank you /u/FishyLawnGnome, very cool.

Oh look another bitch in the comment section...
---
Ahhh the farm of the niftywatch !
---
It should have worked. The druid was clearly surprised at how bad the rogue was.
---
Horde guilds we’re camping the flight paths at Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes, so they flew Loch Moran, wiped the guild waiting in searing gorge, then the guild that was waiting in burning steppes one the way inside MC
---
Ah yeah, it makes sense if that's a buff on them. But everything else remains and there's no excuse why i'd kick a spell at 70% cast time and it will finish the animation, then triger a few ms later.
---
I think I'll try your azhara suggestion and go there. Un'goro really is the worst place you can go to as a lv51 melee.

eh.  I don't heal in classic, but if I did I would do the maths on my ranks.  It's possible the vast majority of people are downranking, but if they don't know enough to do the maths then I highly doubt it.  I think mana efficiency is just bad at low levels.

I've been using this for about a week now, and it's really awesome :)
---
I actually think the game should be this way (higher level players being literally impossible to kill isn't good gameplay), but if we're going for authentic no changes then it's obviously shit coding on their part.
---
I think there's a ton of things under the hood that are not working correctly, certain things you can feel are wrong if you played a ton back in the day. Hopefully over the next several months they all get fixed if people are diligent about reports.
---
Spriests don't even have to cast much against locks. Dispel their dots, keep yours up and fear ward on CD.
---
Plenty of buffs to protect your shields against Devours. You can juke Spell Lock, they cannot juke Silence. Pets' HP don't scale with gear, so they usually die in the first fear.
---
It's one of the easiest matchups for a Spriest actually.

You don't need to misremember things from 12 years ago in relation to this engine. You can experience them right now and private servers in some cases are 10 times more responsive. I'm not going back to them due to different reasons, but damn. PvP in private servers is infinitely better than what we have right now here.

Uh oh. I do this all the time. I better not get a ban. Hopefully it gets cleared up for you

He's still on the troll bro. You know that right?

Unless you want it for aesthetics the shoulders can be replaced by big bad pauldrons in ZF, the helm and the axe are the value pieces from herod
---
I healed all dungeons until the last half of BRD as shadow while leveling without major problems, the last half of BRD, Scholo, Strat and LBRS I wouldn't heal as shadow in leveling gear.
---
I'm sure you can heal all the dungeons as shadow if you gear is good enough, but you probably want to respec full healing to gear up and then respec back to shadow.

Are you ok bud?

As a Mage and Tailor, I find this post offensive.

Indeed.  Also the view fram Ashenvale into Zoram strand on max is absolutely fabulous!

What makes vanish useless?
---
I think I remember reading in wowhead comments that the quest specifically used to be worth a lot more xp/silver before patch 1.12 or so giving 2.2k xp. It's repeatable so that's probably why they nerfed it
---
What do we See Here
---
Imagine when he gets back
---
So they did change it?! I swore it was called The Nicker, and I thought it's because it looked like a giant razor. And I was so confused when all I saw was "The Blackrock Slicer"..
---
Its in the twitch client, I'm running both Acutioneer and TSM currently. Installed both from Twitch and keep both updated through it.  
---
If you're wondering why both - TSM is missing auction data for some items and refuses to list them for me, meanwhile Auctioneer posts it fine. Probably something wrong in my operations but cbf fixing it yet.
---
Guess I was lucky, I got it it done in 15 minutes
---
Lol I read it as BRU.. I need sleep.
---
If you ever figure out how to tell what items have sold for rather than listing price I'm sure it would be a great help to the community.
---
Skull - kill
---
X - secondary target 
---
Everything else - what the leader designates it as.
---
Useless post. This is a global game, there is no be-all end-all system that everyone abides by. 
---
Disagree? Is deadmines DM or VC? Case in point.
---
So I considered this but what I was aiming for was taking away that separate action. I wanted something that would automatically cast aspect of the hawk when I entered combat so from there all I would have to remember is casting aspect of the cheetah after combat.
---
Frostbolt
---
Does she have an auto attack? Could it be off and she is only going out on command to do a special ability instead? I vaguely remember this happening to me back in 2004ish, I know what you're describing had happened to me but I can't remember the fix.
---
This is super wholesome.. I love the community
---
I think he may have Cerebral Palsy if i’m not mistaken. My friends little sister had CP and she was wheelchair bound and had spastic movements as well. She felt some pain which I think most people with CP do experience in some way... so yeah it may be strenuous on his muscles.
---
Still amazing he doesn’t let that hold him back from enjoying the best game ever.
---
Creepy
---
Oh interesting, who do you kill in the guzzler?
---
This is very true, I'm in Smoulderweb and I'm not sure of the ratio tho.
---
I don't get it... what is so Funny....?
---
It was innocently called the nicker as it 'nicks' things like a razor. Unfortunately in modern times, it didnt age well
---
Very cool!
---
Did you stack +shadow damage gear? I am lvl 46 and  I have +175 shadow damage (shadoweave set + "of the wrath" items). Things still melt, maybe it comes from that issue for you.
---
And here I never ask for water unless I’m healing a dungeon.
---
Grats!
---
That’s why it’s green?
---
Wow i play a Mage called Scribbler in my DnD campaign. He’s a war forged but that’s still a funny coincidence. I’m sure your friend is ecstatic wherever he Ian
---
Not as tragic as yours but one of my best friends I met in WoW and who played a big part in escaping my isolated life sadly didn't want to start Classic alongside with me so I simply made a dwarf hunter (which he used to play) so I can play for both of us. he loved the idea
---
Just did it yesterday. It gave me 2200 xp and 70 silver ;o??
---
What addons to see bank while away?

Absolutely amazing. My only sincere question: How stressful/straining is this on his eyes?
---
LF160M to defend org/uc without any gains, just for fun!
---
Until 58+ you absolutely can. You don't have any oh-shit buttons, but you generally shouldn't need them anyways.
---
Your BiS sword? As in the one you'll use at 60? I would have thought Crusader enchant, but that is very expensive.
---
Good to see druids representing!
---
I've heard this is viable only 38+ because the damage from drain life is too low before that.
---
Is this true?
---
You can tank as DPS spec and roll on DPS gear, but make it clear to your group before surprising potential DPS by rolling on something they need.
---
A polite message like "Hey, just a heads up, I want to DPS at 60, so I'll be rolling on DPS gear.  I hope that's cool with you guys."  Will go a long way to avoid any drama.  People who don't want competition for gear will simply leave, and those who are cool with rolling on items will stay.
---
Fear in an instance? LoL I'll take wipes for $500 Alex...
---
Cheers
---
No he did not. Different race different priest ability
---
Shamans also have tremor that should cancel it
---
That's some serious passive aggressiveness!
---
My best friend who was also my wow friend throughout the years passed away almost 3 years ago (feels weird to say how long it actually was. Still feels like it was months ago only). Now every server I play on, i always make sure to reserve his main’s name. 
---
Kinda makes it feel like he’s still always with me.
---
Here’s to our fallen friends :’)
---
Can't wait to get mine! &lt;3 
---
Only lvl 20 so it'll take some more time until then.
---
What you're gonna wanna do is make yourself available as either tank or dps for dungeons, as to have an easier time finding groups (but make sure to let the group know you will be rolling for fury gear). You can without much trouble tank all dungeons (excluding raids) as a fury warrior as long as you have some tanking gear, so if your aim is to be a fury dps, just stay with your fury PvE spec.
---
Its called a cookie on russian servers
---
This happened to me.  I tried to open. Game a few times then I opened battlenet and got a little prompt about cookies bottom right of my screen. Closed it and then I could log in just fine
---
Awkward.
---
I feel incredibly sad now.... I even want to make a gnome to honour this post!! 
---
May your friend's spirit live on forever in Azeroth &lt;3
---
There are already prototypes for this kind of control though. And those doing it are far from richest anything.
---
Almost each of them.
---
I tanked an UBRS run in which 2 melees charged one firetongue and 3 went to the other. I marked skull and cross and advertised for sheeping moon and killing focustarget.
---
What focusing skull means for me as tank is that I can ignore the killtarget, because it dies in the cheap + kidney by the rogue.
---
The gives me more threat. 
---
Now the damage was halfassed, the DPS lost aggro on the firetongue to the WL and the blastwave moshed through the raid. Couple people died, was an unpleasant pull. I said it time and again. Next the warrior tried offtanking drakki with dualwield getting oneshotted...
---
Druid are the most survivable and gank-resistant class in the game, bar none.
---
Not sure you’re going have much of a better time on another class in that regard.
---
Druid’s problem in PvP is a lack of damage, not a lack of survivability.
---
Ultima Online will always be an awesome game but it will never feel the role of wow classic and vice versa
---
It does have a certain magical feeling to it. But I am not a fan of the violet color theme. Music is good yes. 
---
I like stormwind much much more. It’s more epic, more beautiful in my eyes.
---
How can you know it's insincere? Some people have emotions. Some people relate to comments based on their own experiences and it brings a tear or a laugh. Just because you didn't have the same reaction to a post or comment doesn't mean someone else is insincere for having one. People downvoted him because he was unnecessarily negative. Even douchey. That's it.
---
You look very cool
---
Yeah i understand it's green and it's a low chance, but are you telling me 100+ bras for only 6 levels isn't a bit over the top?
---
You tank and you make your own group so you don’t have to worry about complaints regarding what gear you roll on 😊

As a warrior myself I very rarely invite another dps warrior unless it’s a guildmate, and I don’t see why any warrior would
---
Explain before you enter the dungeon that you need in DPS gear if its preraid bis and tank gear is passed if an other plate user want it.
---
That does not let you avoid them entirely though. Had a WC group going yesterday, after first boss is down we notice the loot is set to "need before greed", ask the leader to change to group loot which he does ("sOrRY iT waS a MIsTAke") fair enough, lets move on. We clear the dungeon and get to the last bosses (the elf and the big elemental guy). Right before last boss dies, group leader changes to Master looter and loots the boss. 3 ppl have a meltdown over this behaviour (last guy was in same guild as mister ninja). The group leader (warrior tank) goes "hurrduurr I reserved the loot and I am tank so fu". Guess it's more of a ninja hiding behind loot"reserving", but shitty people are everywhere these days even in low lvl dungeons...
---
Oh yeah no I can easily survive it’s I want to be able to turn the tables and kill them
---
When you're in combat, you cast Hawk. When out of combat, you cast Cheetah, all in one button with no modifiers. 
---
Works just as you described, or am I missing something? You can't automate an action based on just changing combat state.
---
You can still chain it to you Auto shot or any other ability.

Skinning + mining is pretty good at 60 is you plan grinding bats or something similar for gold.
---
1 to 10 sucks but bear form is actually pretty good.
---
Sure, you can equip in combat. But it drains between 500 and 2500 health and mana, so you dont really want to equip it in combat. Also it has a 30s CD upon equipping, so you cant just equip and use.   
---
I have both the trinket and the offhand. The trinket saved my ass or helped me win pvp fights multiple times allready. Meanwhile the offhand hasnt been used once.
---
Maybe maybe not, it's impossible to predict what your experience is going to be in game with other people running around you at any given time of day
---
That's why I really don't let that affect my experience, I can't control who is running around me and what they are wearing when they run around me
---
Hmmm, a mage being a total dick bag...really earning that class its "classic huntard" rep
---
LAN setups like this are the best way to play WoW. Back in vanilla my buddies and I all rolled new toons and played all the way to 60 together in my living room one  summer. Hope you guys have a blast!

Quickfix but it gets most of the job done

Easy for a paladin to say "Buy all the skills" 
---
You definitely should buy the cheap low ranked versions of spells, but beyond that, only what you need for your play style.
---
There are definitely addons for this. Try Gatherer. It shows all nodes you’ve clicked in the past and saves them. Including chests, fishing nodes etc.
---
Not very saturated! Just be aware that if you are into raiding that most folks will beg you to respec. That's not to say that guilds that will raid with a shadow priest dont exist, because they do, but I think more guilds would expect you to be holy/discipline with one priest in the raid taking the shadow debuff talent on the side, rather than a dedicated spriest.
---
Really though, play whatever class and spec speaks to you the most. If the priest aesthetic is your jam, go for it!
---
He's not acting.
---
I'm usually the one marking in dungeons cause no one else seems to want to focus, and I'm a rogue :(
---
if you are rogue you can open your stealth attacks with pickpocket, for example (macro):
---
    #showtooltip Cheap Shot
---
    /cast Pick Pocket
---
    /cast Cheap Shot
---
3 to 4 hours per level, so 20ish hours. 3 hours a day for 7 days.
---
The Square is for raid members who screw up.  It is the square of shame and they wear it til the next person screws up!

Anyone know who the raid leader is?

That was absolutely incredible to watch, let's welcome our new overlords.
---
From personal experience:
---
Refactoring something is actually quite a big development cost sink. Even though most of the work was done for Classic WoW I still think TBC requires a heavy amount of refactoring - especially considering that the core code is now different than it was when TBC released originally which may break things once TBC gets merged. I honestly believe that you heavily overestimate the additional cost it would create to develop classic+ instead of merging TBC to classic.
---
That beeing said, my guess is that TBC will happen - and after that Classic+ at some point.
---
Can you tell us more about the experience, please? Was it boring, annoying at some point, needing to repeat a dungeon that you didn't like? Did you feel like you were undergeared in some slots? Also, can you please tell us your /played at 60 and if you think it is slower or longer than questing?
---
I would like to try some dungeon leveling as a feral druid, i know that druid quests better than warrior :) 
---
Thank you!
---
Yes but to say that because DPS was normalized, aspd doesn’t make a difference is still wrong. I, for example, was using Echeyakee until I decided to switch it up with a swamp jaguar for PvP. Turns out that was a 2.0&gt;1.2 change and was significant.
---
Can I get a papa roach or linkin track with this?
---
Worth the it to pick up on a pvp server while loving imo.
---
If i did mostly dungeons to get preraid bis how much more would that add? Id do as many quests as i can for the dungeons.
---
Or seduction. Dear as a cc is usually a nono
---
Im playing a Rogue and this sounds Really fun. I never start fights because I dont want to annoy other people but this I could live with. Do any of you know a good guide on Rogue PvP? Im new to WoW pretty much.
---
Im lvl 35 and playing an Ambush build (imp Ambush + Remorseless Attacks. Should I Kidneyshot instead of Evisc?

Easy. Disconnect their router.

Hey thank you very much for that. I had no idea it was an even split. I appreciate you
---
&gt;  sometimes 4 people dont have the time to wait
---
Then fuck off to retail.
---
miraculously the amount of metal will have been multiplied eightfold.
---
Same here. I much prefer to frostbolt/fireblast mobs down one or two at a time than aoe grind. AOE farming has to be the most monotonous, boring, repetitive task ever and just introduces yourself to a ton of risk both from mobs and from being low mana(on pvp server)
---
Yes. That's Upper Blackrock Spire (UBRS).  
---
The guild was debating spawning an optional boss in the whelp room. You click a floating obelisk, and the boss spawns. That room is usually skipped. Stepping on an egg spawns a whelp.
---
It’s like you’ve never even played the game
---
There are some really good players on Gehennas Horde - APES just have a lot of experience doing this kind of thing, I think it will get closer over time, there's a ton of R1 arena players in eHEROES and a few other decent guilds on Horde with good PvPers, should get real interesting over there in the future.
---
If you prefer questing, go to thousand needles, the shimmering flats to be exact. Lots of quests, huge mob density. STV, Desolace, arathi highlands, and the alterac mountains quest you get in hillsbrad also help
---
Are you a mage ? I feel like it’d be hard to get into a brd group at 52,  in enjoying dungeon leveling so If that’s an option I’d love to know
---
This advice is sound. I am doing a HoW build slightly modified and its working great. Kitty focus for feral and leveling with key restro talents for healing.
---
It would crit for twice that, since crits are simply 100% increased damage (with Ruin).
---
I use this but for some reason when I installed it, I could no longer see my rolls on loot or see certain chat channels etc. No idea why fixed it now though.
---
Warrior's Embrace, a true classic.

Most dungeon groups don't move fast enough to keep up with questing/grinding exp. The later dungeons take about 2 hours each. Consider that time as 1/4 or 1/2 solo exp.
---
Just don't respec, not a big deal.
---
Thanks!
---
As far as I know there is no negative resistance in Classic though...
---
Unfortunately I'm just a touch short of ZF.

21/30/0 also works :) But what if a raid has 1-2 Eles or maybe a Oomking SS would actualy provide inside a Nightfall proc a pretty well BurstPhase.

The only difference between shadow and holy/disc is that you will need to drink more often.

So, OP is a dummy, but why doesn't Blizz just block the string "black" from all names? I tried a few names with "izz" in them (mostly related to "blizz") and they all said the names were "inappropriate" for whatever reason. Why not just do the same thing instead of doing so after the fact and banning people?
---
No.  You will see plenty of people in tier sets as that is what they like to collect and wear in town. And that's the place you see most people. 
---
And during raids they will wear the actual raiding gear .

Although technically you were correct, as you won't see them running around in it much, they are notorious afk  in cities.

---
Priests are difficult to level.  Mainly it comes down to having a badass wand and the 5 points in wand spec in disc which is majority of your DPS.  People tend to switch to shadow at 40, which makes killing mobs a little quicker, but you'll be in a rotation of burning mana to kill mobs quickly, then conserving mana by wanding as you regen to minimize downtime.  Questing as you've probably noticed n vanilla, isn't fun 30-45, because the devs back then focused a lot on lore, and when you hit 40, they wanted you to travel more on your mount for quests which are now spread out a little more.  Typically, I get all quests in the zone, see where they all are, drop the straggler quests, and do the one that are bunched up.  When they all get spread out to the point I'm doing more running than killing, I leave the zone and go elsewhere because now it's not worth my time.
---
Druid isn't exactly an easy choice either since in vanilla, you got a lot to master, but endgame, they're sought after for their abilities like innervate &amp; brez.  Least back in the day, druids were few, and finding good druids were even harder.  I've heard of people turning down resto druids since they don't have a normal rez, but in my experiences in vanilla, that wasn't the case since healers were hard to come by.  Tanks were as much since basically everyone with a 2 hander would call themselves a tank, and YOLO it all the time.
---
Sadly a random druid attacked him just afterwards he feared us all and ran for it, I hope he got away.
---
Honestly, I'm considering it as well. Congrats on the mount.

You do know that ALL census data is &gt; 2 weeks out of date right? Blizzard disabled the api allowing those addons to work. Its gotten much worse on almost every PvP server
---
Yes. You can use everything from Scrolls, to flasks and Engineering items and and everything else the game has to offer.

I had this problem too. There is a console command out there that works. I’m on mobile so can’t search properly, but I think it is /console rawmouseenable 1

Singular. Frostbolt. He casted 1 max rank frostbolt.  
---
He also casted 8 instants.  
---
Stop being mad cause you have no clue how to play the class after "playing it since classic", unless you mean actually since 1 month ago, which would be understandable.
---
Sunken temple, BRD dungeons. Winterspring and the plaguelands for quests. You can start attunement and other long chain quests. 50 to 60 really is great.
---
And the endgame you think will be great is mostly even more boring grinding for gold to afford things. Until AQ40, I'll probably spend more time leveling other characters than raiding.
---
Mage and hunters are the easiest gold making classes in the game. If you want to provide more of a helpful guide, I suggest starting maybe a warrior or priest and go at it and see what you can come up with. Anything you do come up with will be super easy and more affective for mage/hunter but also be doable by all the other classes as well.
---
Besides that your next big obstacle is making it unique, easy to do, and appealing. Personally I prefer BregVids. I’m against farming and grind shit, super boring imo and bregvids is all about avoiding the farm and grind to make gold.
---
Yeah battlegrounds and arena - PvP where the other people also want to PvP - are my favourite parts of the game. I'll be leveling alts until then :(
---
Yeah you are right, my bad.
---
Mowing down someone with twice your numbers? Pretty good.

Thx for sharing. I mean I agree with you, my friendlist has never been so big. But my ignore list is even bigger. About world PvP, I think it's one of the best things in the game but it's restricted a lot by the absence of ranks and the layering.
---
Nice.
---
Escaped slaves *that are actively seeking to kill all the living*. You learn about it during the first quests you make as a Forsaken.

Shamans needed to place the tremor totem BEFORE the fear/seduction though. Being able to cast it while being cced was only added later in wotlk or even cata iirc.

---
How far past SM? I'm into Mara and still doing it the same way as the guy you replied to. I can see a few difficult pulls in ubrs or scholo assuming you have a group of fresh 60s still in leveling gear, but aside from those there's really no need for any more coordination than "kill skull" for nearly all of the dungeon content.
---
BiS gear for mage is about maximazing spell damage. Intellect will be on the gear anyway.
---
If you're into PvP, it's the same except you even seek stamina above intellect. Fights are shorter in vanilla so if you haven't killed your target after spending 5k mana you're probably dead or soon to be.
---
Cool thanks:)
---
Right, mage water isnt weaker than any other water. Just sounds like your spoiled, regards team warrior. Swriously though, IMO there should e been twice the tanks on food and water, both for mages and from vendor.
---
I skipped shimmering flats altogether this time, I see nothing was lost.
---
I just realized, if you two play together, each making the char of the one the other person lost, it would be a little bit as if you both played with the one you lost.
---
Maybe this is just a bad idea, I don't know, I get little sleep due to classic.
---
My pet can tank!
---
Multiboxing isn't cheating, as per official word of Blizzard themselves.
---
What lvl are you?

It’s the most common thing to lock things like hoj, gladiators chain, ironfoe, lbrs gems, orbs and much more.

I ran like 20 brd runs with locked hoj yesterday and nobody gave a shit.

It's very attractive and frustrating at the same time. Everything seems to take so long to achieve - walking from one side of the map to the other, pulling one mob at a time, quests with super low drop rates - yet I keep playing. I should have quit by now, but the thought of killing every gnome that's ganked me on the way to 60 drives me on. God I hope the feeling from PVP justifies this huge time-sink.
---
I regret having to prop-up a failing company to play a 15 year old game, because I know they'll invest this money poorly in some mobile or lootbox-heavy game.
---
Like any-other game these strategies will just be mimicked &amp; worked on further, that's how it works. Not many people spent the last few years perfecting Vanilla PvP, apart from people like APES who have been sat on private servers, most of the Gehennas Horde bunch are retail players, I'm not saying they will be better than APES as a certainty, but they definitely have room to grow in these types of fights and it will naturally get more challenging for APES over time.
---
Same thing happens in Esports all the time, you get an innovative team with game-changing strategies, they dominate for a while, everyone picks up the meta and builds on it and once again you find competitiveness. I don't mean to downplay APES as players or a guild, they're awesome to watch and clearly good players, I just think the players on Horde Gehennas are also very good and it will eventually make some good fights (especially with the population imbalance), and they obviously have room to get better - since like I said, this is new to them.
---
What a fucking asshole....
---
Ohh
---
On pvp servers you are safe in alliance zones unless you attack horde or type /pvp. But in contested zones eg. Wetlands, arathi, stv. Everyone is flagged as pvp no matter what. So if you dont want to doe to horde stay close to home essentially.
---
Feels bad when WF won't proc. That said I almost wrecked a lvl 50 druid yesterday on my 48 sham from a WF crit. He got the drop on me when I was at about 1/3 HP and only enough mana for a single frost shock. 2 seconds later he is at maximum effort trying to live popping out of cat to get a HoT off and transform into bear. If I had just a minor health pot would have probably killed him on my next swing. 
---
He didn't hang around for round 2 when I would come back with half mana and HP.
---
Hit 60 last week, raided MC tuesday 8/10 and MC&amp;Ony Yesterday after reset with the guild me and some friends made, we got 9/10 and pugged Ony, i started with 1 month sub but i for sure am going 6 months this time
---
Are you playing balance? Im level 32 with full intellect gear and I'm just getting bored of Feral.

Any tips for me??? What spec are you using?

---
r1 arena player means nothing in these situations. This is all about living off of welfare, playing 16 hours a day and being stocked up on consumables/gear.
---
So was your assumption correct or not?
---
That would piss me off. If I am the healer I am getting dibs on all the healing gear that drops, that is a fair demand. If I don’t need it then the SP can roll on it for off spec. I didn’t think you had to specify that when you joined a group but maybe you should.
---
Lol sorry but halfway is actually lvl 44 ! So...don't forget to craft bandages you know
---
Good job!
---
Yep, this is the magic. Been doing this for my rogue and my warlock.
---
You love to see it
---
The suffering of Vanilla WoW is what brings the players together. If an mmo can force players to be social and nice to one another then it's good design.
---
So there are 2 types of zones, Sanctuary and Contested. In Sanctuary zones (starting zones and major cities) you are safe from pvp if it is your factions unless you wish to engage with the enemy willingly. Contested zones, pvp is automatically on and there is no hiding.
---
This has been driving me nuts.
---
Haven't played retail in few months but can't remember having mouse issues there in few expansions, so its something in classic.
---
One advice i got was to enable v-sync and it helped till last week, not sure if there was some hotfix last weeks maintenance that broke it again.
---
Hey nice. What is this zone?
---
I've seen Shackle with the yellow icon but hibernate/trap and stuff is out there for sure
---
&gt;Why make this about NA vs. EU? You’re so cringe with that shit.
---
There is a massive and well known difference in quality between NA and EU guilds. It's a fact.

The top NA guilds are just not organized this well.
---
Lol! Dress her in a tent too, to protect her modesty.
---
Yeah I got bored of ESO about two months in
---
I noticed that the more I play SM the less Stamina and more Spirit I gain, but I can see the increase in the result of evocation.
---
I guess 1500 x each spirit will mean a nice increase :)
---
While you are whirlwinding the healer is probably spamming greater heal because you aren't blocking, parrying or dodging. It's possible but crazy mana intensive.
---
No u
---
Because they're making money from it. It is cheating by any objective definition.
---
Plus clicking, my sides
---
That guy is clueless lol. You probably dodged a bad group op.

Given how rare it is I'd never let go of it. ;P

The Tenacious Defender with "the power to move you" belt comes to mind out of TBC.

Cheers buddy!

Of course the rogue responds like that, well at least I get to enjoy stv as an alliance. Right? Right?
---
Thank you. Well beeing a mage obviously helps alot. After i got my levle 40 mount i was saving every bit of silver i could, selling greys/greens and farming mobs where they also drop silver. When i hit 60 i had around 500gold. I got few lucky drops like libram of voracity wich sold for 40g each, few travelers backpack wich sold for 17-18g and i farmed essence of air and earth in sillithus.
---
every time
---
Faerlina, I msged him after and he said he felt bad after. i was pretty sad bc that was the first time ive seen it spawn in my 31 total hours in the badlands
---
But if they gave paladins a pegasus, they couldn't have turned around and sold us one a couple of years later.
---
Can't place traps in combat :(
---
Playing a priest and doing fine so far. I've only reached lvl 32 but I read a lot about down ranking your abilities when healing. When does this start to get relevant and can anyone give me some hints about it and/or good guides for it? Thanks! :)
---
&gt; No one is running around with a full set of gear in their precious bag space swapping out between mobs to get mana. That's fucking asinine.
---
Yeah, bagspace is scarface.
---
I've been having a blast. Have a 39 undead mage, 33 human warrior, and 29 dwarf priest. Couldn't decide what I like more and different friends on different servers. Cant stop wont stop. Finally started using bank alts which I never did before and it's so much more efficient. Mount here I come x3
---
Hallo Kassenführer!
---
Raid guilds generally have established raid times. They would have been there with a time buffer of 30 minutes or so.
---
How do you know it’s gotten worse with no census data?
---
You feel like it did?
---
I agree the skillset required for R1 arena and Wpvp mass scale battles is in no way the same, I just meant they're capable people, I've seen them walking around - they have plenty of time on their hands too lol
---
I've litterally been in MC already bruh, you're wrong. Let me know when you finally hit level 40
---
You missing out the game by grinding like that.
---
Can you clarify the renew? From what I've gathered it's really not mana efficient. Is the heal worth the more time you have until the next heal is necessary?
---
congratulations on your character becoming dr. manhattan!
---
Hunter42
---
Not only good leading, but everyone was actually listening to his commands.
---
Almost purely a max level thing. You could have like one button for a lower rank of your big heal while leveling but it's nowhere near needed
---
I also have a big black clock on my wall.. No idea why they force renamed you. Too many special snowflakes around nowadays. I think it was a funny word play.
---
Does Bliztik not sell shadow oil anymore? I'm parked on top of him and he doesn't have the recipe, like, not even sold out, just not visible.

What? There are plenty of times where hunter uses cheetah to kite no?
---
Razorgore adds, gluth  zombie adds, General drakkisath, BWL dragon trash, all 4 bosses for Rhok'delar quest ?
---
It was an excitement share and a happy moment for me that i wanted to share, didnt mean to brag by any means that i had gold for mount and others dont. Theres plenty of other classes who got epic mounts not just mages.
---
Feels kinda off to me to play as your friend who passed away. I mean I respect honoring them but idk i just would feel uncomfortable playing as their character.
---
I play PvE so no backstabbing horde for me until BGs.
---
If you do cathedral right, you can do it to 44 easy, but thats with mages and like 4-5 pulls and then reset, bosses and everything
---
Your name is fine.  But....
---
I agree with Blizzard on asking you to change your name.  That's just how it goes, they can't review every variant of these kind of names, that would require too much resources.  so they just have one rough rule that doesn't always fit and some names get mowed down with the bad ones..  collateral  damage.
---
However, they are  stupid fucks  replying to you in that fucking corperate bullshitspeak.   At least one of the responses should explain the bit I wrote above.
---
Prefer massive mammary dps tbh
---
If you've achieved all this in such a small space of time then you definitely need a break.
---
Nightfall won't be in the game until phase 3. But yes, it should be ret priority.
---
It's cheating by your subjective definition of cheating.  
---
Blizzard made the game; Blizzard made the rules. The rules permit multiboxing. The rules OBJECTIVELY permit multiboxing.

It's running on the 7.3.5 WoW client.
---
They probably changed it sometime the past 14 years. They might actively have to go back and reverse it.
---
Yes, but this gives you the opportunity to feel like Varian before his last moment..
---
speaking as a Shadow priest who often heal in dungeons. Both regular groups and spellcleave groups can be fun. Not a fan of Mele Cleaves. They take way to much dmg and have bad control over the mobs. Pretty stressfull as the healer, at least a shadow specced healer :D
---
But a proper spell cleave is imo quite fun, just 3 mages a Lock and me.
---
The pulls can be quite insane and if done well the healers job is quite easy, but if a pull goes bad its fun to safe the day :)
---
I don't get all the hate for the cleave type of groups, atleast on my server there are plenty of people looking for regular groups, so just join that kind of group if you want to.
---
Seems pretty likely to me
---
Is she smackin dat azz??
---
Where did it drop and from who
---
vigourously
---
Congrats!

The keyword is prototype. It is not even at commercial level yet. Palm was selling smartphone in 90s and only until 2010 smartphone technology is matured enough. 
---
The current prototype is limited at motion command while the technology in SAO *sends sight, hearing, and taste into human brain*.
---
I’m not disputing that fact. 
---
The point I’m making is that there was zero reason to bash on NA in this post. It’s cringey as fuck when I see people bring up NA vs. EU in threads where it literally has nothing to do with it.     It makes the individuals who make the comments look petty as fuck. 
---
Celebrate in the fact that these guys did something amazing.
---
Seems pretty dumb ngl
---
I’ve been grinding quests up until 34 but at this point, I just want to get my mount and then I’ll go back to world questing. Getting tired of running around everything
---
? You can pay for as many accounts as you want to have lol
---
These kids spoiled now days smh
---
So there is a way but very hard to obtain gear coz of gear rules down rank shock (r1-r2) some d2 parts lots of agility for constant flurry str/ap nightfall for raids arcanite reaper for solo dungeons +5 hit if not mistaken all in all low to medium tire dps better then retri or feral but you might steal agrro form t2 tanks with quadruple wf + hoj crits
---
Hmm Horde flair... you didn't?..
---
Is  Diremaul out yet?
---
I use Wowman, you can find it on github. If you use arch its in the AUR. Seems to work good.

For reference this is my first MMO game I have ever played. I'm 31 years old and do not ask me how a long time gamer has never played an MMO let alone the most popular one. So I decided to research the item before listing it and found out that this is one of the rarer items in the game? Anyone care to comment on this because I am like I said completely new to the genre and this game (which I love playing!!!).

It’s a bannable program people use to keep their characters moving when they’re away so they don’t go AFK/get logged out. Report on sight.

Global level scaling is what really ended up putting me off ESO. I just couldn't stand not feeling more powerful as I progressed.
---
Guys being dudes
---
Yes, I do. If they first start down that path they will continue to walk it. And I think that will make people lose interest. We already know what's down that road.
---
Okay I'm not crying... you're crying
---
Didn't get my mount til like 47. NBD. I was doing dungeons anyway.
---
I noticed that also last week when I went to the shimmering flats
---
I think my raid leader would be a bit annoyed if i feared a mob on Majordomo.

that sounds like Golum singing when he is catching fishes xD

I agree. Make it very clear and take screenshots.

They're clearly not the same NPC. Just look at the hair.

Yeah, gotta agree with ya
---
That’s what I ended up saying but she’s all about discovering the world itself and not so much it’s story 
---
She walked from Durotar to Ashenvale as a lvl 4 just looking around
---
But playing them at the same time with perfect sync like you have another player as a hunter pet is just gross, and everyone acting like it's totally fine is utterly insane to me. Normal players with only one sub cannot possibly compete in pvp or farming.
---
I'm a healer and I hate people being marked in dungeons because it makes the unit frames harder to read... Not enough to really affect it, but just enough to be a bit annoying with no real benefit for a five man... Raids it's super useful though, especially during explanation time or as a stack on this person thing.
---
Comic Sans was made with being easy to read in mind. The font in the picture though...
---
you won internet today.
---
Grats bro. Don’t worry too much about a mount you got that dope wolf form to run around in.
---
Yeah you’re kind of overreacting.
---
That doesn’t mean that you can’t be abhorred by it, however, or disagree strongly with your GM.

Haha Kassenführer isnt a apprentice anymore, I am Bootsazubi!

It's not even just tradechat, me and some buddies were trying to form a BFD group on our alts, we had multiple high levels whisper us for an invite because BFD=BRD obviously... Ended up spelling out the entire dungeon name "blsckfathom deeps" but it still happened... Smh
---
If anyone recorded or streamed look over the recording and watch the tanks rage bar. If its sitting at full as i suspect theyre not using heroic strike enough.
---
Heroic strike should be used on every auto attack if rage generation allows it.
---
I've had the most fun with doing 1 dungeon per level and a stack of quests. I got absolutely bored out of my skull doing the same dungeon 10 times. 2 consecutive runs, tops. Also a warrior.
---
During my 1-60, I frequently had groups of 1-2 warlocks, 1-2 rogues and a druid healer. All the other warriors and mages were constantly 'cleaving'. I finally met some of them at level 60 in dungeons and it has been largely hilarious. Mages getting themselves killed frequently. I guess its unavoidable that certain groups of people.. (teens?) get obsessed with copying streamers and there's others who obsess over an idea of efficiency which ignores 'the journey'. The concept of efficiency always has major blind spots. Just be sure not to get burned out on the game.
---
Fun part: If you mix English and Catalan rogue name's means -just shit-

Heads up man. Karma doesn't do anything. He's just sharing a cool moment and memory. I hope you find happiness in your sad life that frees you from having to say things like this.

oh, never knew that. Cheers.

Yea this guy is an idiot. You can heal ZF as shadow. BRD and higher might be harder but it’s not impossible.
---
Google tells me it is very rare, but I can't know for sure. Never seen it before tho, looks great for a feral druid. Don't sell it cheap I guess

Agreed, he commands insane respect, the leadership and discipline is by far the most impressive part of the video to me.

Too bad there isn't a kind of cloth to cover up your chest. Like a tabard or something like that...
---
It's a pvp server, these things happen
---
&gt;  Why would anybody do that?
---
&gt; once succeeding
---
That depends on your definition of when you "think about" something.
---
When I put on shoes, I definitely notice whether it's the right or left foot that shoe goes on, and I have to think about whether I can just put my feet down that pair of shoes or if I have to use a finger to prevent mashing the sides of the shoe down with my foot. I'd count that as "thinking about" my feet when I'm putting on shoes.
---
Pets have been buggy for Classic WoW, Hunter pets too have weird behaviors like the one you describe.
---
Hunters are also having an issue with Feign Death + Trapping (slightly unrelated note).
---
At any rate, the Blizzard devs are looking at it.
---
What I did from 1-40 was bake /petatrack into all my spell macros. This was never a problem then. 
---
Since I multidot now, I’ve been manually ordering her to attack. I bind mw up and mw down to attack and follow; never had any issues.
---
Right, but mages can't immediately summon the water appropriate to their level. They have to wait until 10 for level 5 water, 20 for 15, 30 for 25, etc.
---
*cries in spriest*
---
Oh man. This got me. So awesome.
---
I also lost a dear friend I played wow with almost every day. He committed suicide in 2008. I'd been playing with him in darnassus just the day before. He would have loved to play classic again.
---
What a great way to honour him.
---
Must be nice being a mage and having the gold at 40 while us hunters are poorer than homeless people
---
green = brave
---
red = dead
---
blue = scared
---
I believe it’s “yes yes”
---
??? it's in terms of leveling not how fast/slow it went.
---
Not at all! I going back from classic to eso cuz wowc is not for me

Well, the solution would be layering exxesive Horde out to preserve Alliance/Horde ratio. That would leave most Skeram Horde without honor, but since they are ganking in numbers they don't need any.
---
At this point, at least on my mid to high pop server, vendor all.
---
Sure but he still got killed after killing my friend.

Just re-subbed all accounts (family), we are currently around 35ish.

&gt; There are plenty of times where hunter uses cheetah to kite

That's what I said.

Which part is confusing you?
---
well then whats your tank/cat gear from mc/ony? can't really get a tier set.
---
I like to use a 2h if they’ll let me, or if I don’t have an up to date shield, but I stance dance all day. 
---
My usual rotation at ~25 is:
---
Battle Stance
---
Thunder 
---
Demo Shout
---
Defensive Stance
---
Revenge when it’s up
---
Taunt to get aggro losses
---
Sunder armor spam. 
---
This is my first time tanking and playing Warrior though, so I might be doing it wrong. I’m specced into arms mostly.
---
It takes a lot less effort to organize yourself than 5 people, money is the factor here. He's paying to have an advantage.
---
An example of where this is useful to warlocks is the drain soul spell. It doesn’t deal significant damage (even at max rank), so you’re best off using the rank 1 version for farming soul shards!
---
If you are to low lvl for the current quests in a given area, try either grinding a couple of levels, or go to another area that is level apropriate. Check for new qsts in STV, Dustwallow March, Badlands, Swamp of Sorrows, ... for levels 35-45.
---
As for being accepted as DPS and being viable as DPS or a tank as a paladin in normal dungeons:
---
- you are ok as DPS as ret, but you are the best single target healer, so people will want you to do that, but as holy spec you will be better
---
- as a tank, you are very viable, but you'll need to spec protection/holy, because you'll need consecration and the block talents.
---
- again ret can output decent dps, but another dps will be able to do it better, if you run with friend groups you can definitely do it, grouped with randoms you might be laughed at, it is sad but true :/
---
I'm also playing a paladin, also specced ret because it's the fastest way to level if you are a solo player and don't care about pre lvl 50 dungeons, which I don't.
---
You can still heal dungeons as ret spec if you gather some healing gear though, you don't necessarily need to respec.
---
questing is a bit of a ball-ache but i've loved it all the way. also revived my love for retail which is everything but a bad thing. think i will stay subbed a lot longer this time
---
I like to use a 2h if they’ll let me, or if I don’t have an up to date shield, but I stance dance all day.
---
Thunder
---
Sunder armor spam.
---
yeah that guy doesn't feel bad at all. he gets a kick out of hurting even his own faction and that's an easy ignore in my book.
---
my sweet summer child, I know I don't really need them as a druid, but last night it took 5 mobs of same level just with auto attacks to get from 153-154
---
I mean NPCs get that penalty
---
This isn't a great comparison as player skill is also a factor. I'm sure you would have been fine if the 38 was 2h tanking.
---
It’s considered the best solo lvling specc up to 40
---
I feel for you. A dear friend of mine, whom had introduced me to WoW, had also recently passed away.
---
Man, it makes me tear up just thinking back.
---
Imagine reserving loot in low level dungeons. God damn some people...
---
so you've gotta go to the back of the steps? I was thinking this ealier why no "zzz" when in the inn?!?
---
This isn't about WoW classic, delete.
---
It’s not like you need the buffs at all. I’ve seen complete PUGs complete MC 10/10 in one night already. They wouldn’t go back to bed.
---
Point the other guy was making is not that LoE is a cooldown, but a consumable you can use once per character ever.
---
Aw, congrats! I've been doing something similar; my step father introduced me to vanilla WoW but passed away a couple of years back, so I've created a younger version of his paladin with an anagram of his character's name.
---
Thank you! The website was a HUGE help!
---
We just have to wait til the Halloween event and get those orc masks and they will never know the difference
---
Devilsaur is camped/ganked to hell
---
&gt;there's really no need for any more coordination than "kill skull" 
---
Yes, I agree, this is the lamentable state of affairs, that a significant portion of dps is incapable of handling that directive. 
---
about 1/3 of the rogues seem to actively avoid skull, because it makes their personal DPS meter higher if they can build a full 5 combo points on a target.  some casters think "I am aoe spec" is a valid excuse for aoeing every single mob in the dungeon before they even reach the tank etc.
---
I feel like the wording of your title messed up the meme, or you messed up the meme.
---
haha thanks!
---
Being a low level bystander to this gets you killed.
---
Icefury wand will be best until 60, hold onto it
---
It's definitely not the same classic. Mobs move different, player coding different, different macros etc. Melee Leeway alone changes so much.
---
Omg I’m a 5 year old in a 31 year old body 😭
---
I have some points in Suppression and he resisted 1 drain life I guess :p
---
Saving 70 gold is never worth running all the way from 40-60
---
Wait.. that big fat red cross means "actually attack this, but after the prio target"?!? I always thought that it means "Do NOT touch this badass!"
---
Yes it is
---
Lol the guy looks like he’s confused because he doesn’t have his mount
---
Be feral. Get the run-speed talent. Get a pair of cloth boots enchanted with +movement speed and wear them when traveling. Kill all mobs to and from your questing location. Run each dungeon once for the quests, only repeat runs if there is gear that will last you \~10 levels; only SM is really worth running repeatedly with PUGs for XP.
---
Most people reach 60 between 6 and 10 days /played.
---
That's a sword, not a mace.
---
Warrios cant break seduction, only undead can
---
It is known
---
&gt;  Do any of them change significantly from the level 20 point for general PvE?
---
Druid get a cat form at 20, +30% movement speed at 21, +40% movement speed at 30 and Dire Bear at 40. Plus there's increase movement speed during stealth, but I don't remember levels.
---
All of this help significantly in leveling. In general you are not even in the hurry to get 100 gold for mount at level 40 :)
---
I should note that the other rogue only rolled after expressing disbelief at Onicez rolling and also whispering me some "wtfs" about his need roll, his roll was to lower the chances of Onicez taking off with it.
---
Spl dmg is your best friend, so don’t cheat on her (unless it’s with more spl dmg)
---
This literally happens to me every single time. Why are people so stupid?
---
/cast [nohelp, nodead] !Auto shot
---
/cast [combat] !Aspect of the Hawk
---
/cast [nocombat] !Aspect of the Cheetah
---
As long as autoshot doesn't trigger GCD, it should work just as you describe, or?
---
You walked into that.  If you can't shit talk dont start it.
---
After getting clanked on by wotf, the way is : fear them-&gt; they use wotf -&gt; curse of exhaustion -&gt; wait 5 sec -&gt; use seduce -&gt; use curse of elements -&gt; soulfire -&gt; drain soul
---
Only way it won't work is on undead warriors
---
I am pretty sure that this falls under the witch hunting rule for the sub !
---
While you can heal just fine, you have to consider you have Shadow brethren out there joining as healer for a dungeon and forgetting to heal the tank because they were too busy mind flaying and getting unnecessary aggro constantly with mind blast, so people will be prejudiced. 
---
Just don't pop shadow form when you're grouped in a PUG and you'll avoid that perception.
---
Wait, the condom doesn’t belong on my brother’s head? Well shit!
---
Litarly evryone has his own things with the target just let the party leader type out what’s what
---
You did not understand it since you accused him of you mentioning mulgure which he absolutely did not
---
What addons are you using? Especially the health and mana bars.
---
Dps upgrade is a dps upgrade. Witch hunting is a witch hunting.
---
Thank you, what professions did u learn?33
---
Waiting for someone to reply that this is fun to them in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...
---
Unpopular opinion: I’ve had people be extremely kind and helpful in both classic and retail wow. I’ve also met people who did not want to help do some of the simplest things to help a group members in both game versions.
---
Going out of your way and giving your time to help someone is a trait you can have in classic and retail.
---
p.s Kudos to you op, and your raid for helping out a fellow player!
---
Wrong.
---
Follow guides is fine, just make sure you are using common-sense along the way and finding moments to farm mobs. Always try to be 2 - 3 levels ahead.
---
I hope the new mods will delete stream ads like this immediately.
---
&gt; your snide last sentence would make more sense if the Tirisfal and Mulgore areas weren't so straightforward
---
He didn't? Fuck off.
---
Speaking as a healer the 2h thing is a double edged sword. Sure they keep aggro more easily, which means that you're not panicking and having to heal 3 people who all have aggro. But they also take so much damage that on larger pulls you'll often struggle to use the 5 sec rule to regen mana. It alters the playstyle of allowing the tank to drop, bursting them up and then not healing for a bit, to blowing 90% of your mana on a pull because you have to cast a heal every 3 seconds. I've been levelling as enhance, and its perfectly doable so far, up to Uldaman at least, just a little bit annoying with the extra drinking. Perhaps it's easier if youre specced into resto,  but I have a feeling it won't actually be faster overall until people are well geared
---
It wouldn’t be +7 dps, it would be 7 dmg. I assume it isn’t modified by str/ agi/ atk power. Maybe it affect abilities that deal X% of weapon damage.
---
Good takeaway from the post bro
---
Shockadin can't do jack shit to priests and warlocks, they fear and drain you and you can't do anything about it. And if it's not a duel but just a world PvP 1v1 you can't ever catch a hunter, druid or mage either, Rogue uses vanish and you have no dots... etc etc.
---
I think I did hear about a guy called McConnell playing Classic. 
---
Was he Ret maybe?
---
Nothing wrong with it if you don't want the item anyways. Who gives a fuck if they reserve like that ring in mara, or ironfoe when you're a caster?
---
Add in searing pain + shadowburn after soul fire with a queued up another seduction for round 2, but this time it is curse of shadow with shadow bolt and immolate along soul drain/deathcoil for maximum disrespect
---
Fear is barely used as a CC, too risky for the mob to chainpull more when running around in fear.     
---
First 4 check, but the rest is nonsense (in terms of general usage, maybe you did it like this). Please don't confuse people with something that is not general knowledge.
---
if i understand correctly (plz correct me if im wrong) this item was an upgrade for him so he rolled need?
---
this is completly fine
---
I’m a new classic player who’s never played retail before: why should I have to visit another sub, irrelevant to me, for cool posts like this?
---
so what class u playing rn?
---
I know it’s just pixels but damn it’s hot;)
---
This is not about classic, what's your point?
---
&gt; Wrong.
---
Except he's claiming the stuff it's telling him to fight now is too high, so how am I wrong? Just do the fucking quests in the zones and shit like this won't happen.
---
Same tbh
---
Throm-Ka, respect.
---
So you're trying to tell me people bought that water to..drink it?
---
shouldnt be an issue as long as you have the int/stam/spirit gear. 
---
I'm level 48 shaman, with 31 points in Ele, the rest in resto, and I've healed ZF several times (from level 45 onwards). Healed all other instances as I levelled.
---
Because wtf does this even stand for? Virgins have been playing this for like 14 years and expect normal people to understand what any of this crap means? All we have is references from other video games..
---
I know next to nothing about Asmongold (I'd say the only thing I know is that there were some funny youtube videos about him), and *nothing* about McConell (never heard of him until your post), but I HAVE read that despite what complaints people make about Asmongold, his shenanigans are really just for show and actually he's a very good guild leader.
---
Or who  flip the  AH? I  made 300g week one  off cloth.....
---
Lets meet, Drink and complain about our lives tonight. Im serious
---
Exactly this. So many tanks in here complaining are stuck up in their playstyle. There are multiple ways to play and if you cannot tolerate another style then look for players who feel the same and go dungeons your way. But people just join a random group and then complain when people play differently. 
---
The most important skill one can have is to adapt. The worst players are those who can’t adapt. They can learn a fight and play it in this one way but the moment something goes wrong, they don’t know what to do anymore. You see this often with pure PvE players. That’s why I always urge people to do some PvP as well. It teaches you to use your full kit in spontaneous ways.
---
I mean, it's not incorrect!

---
What surprises me this time around, is that if you just save your money and not buying stupid shit on the Ah the money accumulates surprisingly fast. Bought mount at 40 with 30g to spare, now I’m 44 and already back over 100g
---
You can get it to 125% happy FYI
---
I'd say 41-42, but haven't really measured it. Cath can probably be good for a cleave group.. I personally switched it for RFD/Uldaman at 41.
---
Don't join the run then.

I see why you WERE a raid leader and why you’re not any longer
---
It's all an act to create content. Everything streamer does it to some degree for entertainment purposes to create some form of drama or hype. Who cares, you either play along or ignore it. The servers that streamers were going to be on were known ahead of time and by picking one, you willing opened yourself up to possibly interacting with their shenanigans.
---
&gt; Hey,
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I am playing a shaman for the first time of my life and haven't played WoW at all for a couple of years. I am at the beginning of earning talent points and wonder about the Enhancement talents from the shaman. What kind of role will I become, if I focus on that tree?
---
&gt; It seems like it a mixture of dealing more damage and becoming more resistant to anything. What is the main "sense" behind Enhancement? Is this tree to focus more on weapons and less on (damage) spells?
---
&gt; It looks a bit like I could become some kind of horde paladin, if I put my points into Enhancement and Restoration. Is this worth it?
---
&gt; Actually I wanted to focus on the DPS role in dungeons, but if I could be second tank and/or healer, I'd be fine, too. I definitely want to go with 1-hand-weapon and shield.
---
You can always stay as a shaman and still go tank as a Shaman Tank if you really want to remain within the shaman class.
---
Amazing! So much respect for this guy!
---
Is this a copy pasta? Like the 300 confirmed kills marine?

QUARTERMASTER KEEPS DROPPING HIS STUPID LOCKBOX WHEN I JUST WANT MY DAMN HANDS OF POWER.
---
I wouldn't even say classic has killed ESO more than ESO has killed itself. Devs have been letting sever lag and performance issues, as well as many inconvenient or game-breaking bugs run rampant for years, and people have just been getting fed up with it. I have 1500+ hours logged into ESO and after Summerset release I had a lot of enjoyment with the game but the devs have been doing a horrible job of maintaining performance and instead have been dipping their toes into the Pay-to-win teritory and also releasing combat "balance" changes that drove away the near entirety of the endgame population because people who just farmed good enough gear for veteran (heroic) content as well as mastered a new rotation to adapt to new changes from August 7th are now having to do it all over because the combat team said, "These skills are too powerful in PvP, so we are going to nerf them and offer no compensation to DPS in PvE."
---
What happened reddit, we like APES now?
---
Kill all at same time and never wait for tank to get aggro.. got it
---
Oh... okay...
---
Kidney shot humanoids running away, instead of using a dps poison as a crippling poison.

Frost is popular because :
---
1) it's efficient in leveling, pvp, pve, raid WHILE being braindead easy
---
2) Fire do literally ZERO damage for the first two raids because everyone is immune to fire.
---
Don't be too sad, in Naxx, the situation is reversed.
---
I JUST quoted what he said. You are so fucking stupid it's painful.
---
those emulator players don't know shit, just wait until the professionals take over
---
oh wait
---
Do you know if @target or something works?
---
He meant he didnt?.. Kill him
---
Mate, they hit for 42 damage. If your max rank frostbolt is hitting for 42 damage, that's a bad sign.
---
I'll be bored enough to use different criteria if you have a better idea. Reasons to go between cities are so varied that "place sorta near FP to place sorta near FP" seemed good enough.
---
So spread out yikes, fucking amateurs.
---
What the guy you're replying to actually said if you stopped to read it right:
---
&gt; you accused him of **you** mentioning Mulgore
---
I did not actually say you mentioned Mulgore or Tirisfal, I said based on those two areas my assumptions of Durotar were different. I don't know why you're insistent on being rude and abrasive, we're all just here to enjoy the same game.
---
Its possible.
---
Then why are you implying that horde only fight easy fights?
---
F\*cking each other of them think they have to make yet another worthless post and litter this subreddit with loot/mount/ding posts.  
---

&gt;wondering what the hell happened to players.
---
Nothing happened, you were just one of those very retards back in the day. You're now a decade+ older and with that maturity you can see what it has always been.
---
Don’t know man, seems a little underwhelming

I’m a lock so gold for my first mount is irrelevant

He edited his post. Initially it didn't mention *you* as in me.
---
It's not a very good attempt at the follow through though.
---
A true coward, attack a lower lvl, while he is fighting a mob, then runs away...
---
I don't know. I got my patterns and left. I'm fairly certain it doesn't update live but you're more than welcome to find out on your own.
---
Preach brotha. Still have mage-induced PTSD from my vanilla/tbc days as a warrior main.  My priest now is my reckoning lol.
---
Fartnite kids smh my head, amirite guys??? 😂
---
oh wow. I had plenty of moments with alliance assholes trying to kill me right after i came low out of a npc fight or still in the fight
---
This!! Just get a drink or something while hopping on a bird, or having to pay attention to the tram all te time is a huge difference
---
And they found the best use for it. Do you really think the guild that beat Raggy within the first reset in greens and lv. 55s in the raid will need much help blitzing the content beyond?
---
I know this is an unpopular opinion, but you kinda have to understand where APES come from. They were the cream of the crop in private servers, where mob damage was heavily inflated (we're talking up to 70-80% more damage by elites, where a single careless pull signaled a wipe); they were infamous for their surgical PVP strikes, often schooling raids several times their size due to coordination; and perhaps most importantly, they haven't just mastered vanilla content, they absolutely PERFECTED it. I suspect it's down to muscle memory now.
---
I mean, their reputation as wee gobshites was entirely deserved - they were a bag of dicks, and even the pserver community would regularly shit on them. But these guys loved the game, and they became legends because they could pull off some really spectacular shit.
---
Using a once-per-character item to tell the Horde (which outnumbered them both server-wide and especially in this particular battle) "go sit in the corner, and put your dunce hat on"... I don't know. It looked awesome. I play strictly PvE, but fuck, I'm now SO tempted to reroll on a PvP server when I get back home after work.

At 40? Nothing, really (oh, buy a mount!). Around 50 is where you can get started. So keep on grinding!  
---
(And save them golds for your epic mount)
---
alliance players everyone
---
At least some of them ask like that, or some also ask for what level a certain dungeon is. That's totally fine and I don't mind telling them. What I find annoying is if I'm searching for the herod part in sm and a lvl 29 whispers "inv, I'm dd"... No... No you're not, little one...
---
Feels extra good knowing how sweaty they are and still got out-sweatied
---
Put on the dress and heal, or reroll to arms warrior.
---
Ah, a classic "whooosh"
---
&gt;massive and we'll known
---
yea no, this is the first I've ever heard of this.
---
On a PvP server?
---
macro plz daddy
---
Again, your point? You realise the sheer number of people that NEVER used that item precisely because of that "one time" stuff? You're gonna find it pretty hard to find a better situation than when you're like 40v80 in WPvP.
---
Besides, I don't know how many of them even had it still, Monkeynews for example didn't.
---
Looking at it objectivelly, the chance she genuinely intended for it to be a joke is slim to none. Outside of showing cleavage on twitch and shoving things into your orifices on various camsites, you need some kind of niche hook to be a succesful non-nude e-thot. I have serious doubts about it just being a coincidence.
---
Where did I do that?
---
Thank you, but he's not worth the effort. The guy you're replying to missed the 'you' when you said:
---
&gt; you accused him of **you** mentioning
---
And misunderstood your post. Based on his posts elsewhere this guy has issues and isn't worth the headache of talking to him.
---
2004 level of sexy
---
No one is saying that he didnt say mulgore retard. We are just saying that he didnt say that YOU said mulgore which you are accusing him of doing.
---
True that, kind of been like that with ost X-pacs as well, specially the early ones.  But this was quite extreme, but i was rather happy about the ques and all those people. Seeing zone just sprawling with life is fantastic.  
---
Even yesterday when i was in tarren mill and i see like maybe 10-15 allies around the town, and some 20 horde in town grouping up ready to get at it, and then some smaller grups running around minding their own busyness, so fantastic. 
---
Was in Westfall though when i made an alt for a bit, and i had to stop playing as it was indeed, too full.
---
😢 Really hit me this time of the morning reading this!
---
&gt; Rumuors

&gt; cant find any info on this
---
Think you answered your own question.
---
Not true at all. The 8 piece tier 2 is not even used for bis at any point. The only tier 2 piece mages use is the legs off rag for stats. Simple google search will show you how bad the set bonuses are on t2 compared to raw stats on all the other pieces.
---
Unless you know what you are doing.
---
No, will probably be added in phase 5.
---
Reported for reporting.
---
You edited your post. Done responding to you.

More like Oddjob (left-handed)
---
Are the summonstones at the dungeons bugged for anyone else?
---
No you don’t. You’ve never had anything important to do all your life. Your mom does everything for you and no one would ever entrust you with anything significant.
---
Doesnt have the vibe of the original copypasta, nice try tho
---
How the fuck is the honor system fun/rewarding without BGs? You are barely getting anything due to the low amount of kills.
---
This is why skinning is so important when farming turtles..
---
Its was actually 33.3333% repeating of course
---
Wow! Nice WoW dictionary! Can I suggest putting this up as a PSA on the subreddit for other plebs? (Err new players I meant new players)
---
The end of the sentence is “kill him”.
---
Most of the time you dont even switch layers when you get your invite (Idk if its bugged or if it just works like that) and it has a cooldown of one hour.
---
I am Preeeeeeeeetty sure no one with break down because they cant play without a "gamebreaking" inter-dimensional teleport, mostly because that gamebreaking teleport is not even close to gamebreaking.
---

#NOCHANGESREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Oh relax

Someone at Blizz cared enough.

Bet you also are top dps and top healing as well, never lost threat a single time...

Because something happened in the period between 2004 and 2019 and now people are offended by the slightest thing.

So no hotpants. Hotpants are the devil, you see.
---
So if you happen to get the worst tram situation, it should be roughly the same right?
---
Frankly I take it as 45b for a few minutes afk and only take the tram if I'm already in the district near it, otherwise I fly.
---
The forsaken, which are the playable undead, are scourge that freed themselves from the lich King's mind control.
---
They've been abandoned by their families upon becoming scourge, and can't procreate. The apothecaries are trying to increase their numbers by designing a similar Plague, that's why a lot of their quests got you gathering ingredients and testing their concoctions.
---
At risk of spoilers: in retail they eventually succeed right before the assault on ICC, and get a Plague capable of killing the living and scourge alike.
---
"Don't follow guides"
---
You're wrong. End of story.
---
See I that way, there is one retard less you'll group with. Shadowpriest (with proper gear) can heal every dungeon so far. Yes for scholo and strat will be tough, little margin for error but it's fine.
---
Was going to write this. Most hunters i've met in classic are nice (unless they're a male nelf), while almost all mages act like assholes
---
It's in the context of warlocks using health to get Mana. Therefore if they lifetap during a fight they need to heal. How do you suggest they eat?
---
I had ~450g at level 57. Before I bought my Warden Staff and leveled enchanting to 265 for Smoking Heart of the Mountain. No world epics or expensive rares dropped. I just didn't spend any gold on potions or gear (except BiS pieces at high level) and a mount. Fished up wreckage pools and oily blackmouths where I could, sold all cloth and leather from skinning. Disenchanted stuff when it was worth more than the vendor price, and had a bank alt I sent everything to and checked a few times/day. It really isn't too unreasonable.
---
The first rule of pvp is that you don't engage druids in less than 2v1
---
He should turn on auto loot and enable Leatrix Plus automation to make his life easier.
---
- speed leveling, respec to full aoe and SM spellcleave
---
- keep question in desolace  arathi highlands, stv, dustwalllow march. Do RFD, SM for quests and exp.
---
- farm mobs with good vendor greys for money for a few levels
---
Re-colored assets are easy to make, but they take up just as much space as every other icon. Which still isn't a lot of space, but given how big WoW already was, it may have seemed not worth it to make the icon set 2-3x larger just for this.
---
You can also program in software tinting pretty easily, but it does add some complexity to the process, slows down rendering slightly, and means you need to track not just which icon each item uses, but also what tint should be applied to that icon.
---
And then tinting only really works on white or near-white objects, the icon here is basically an ideal example. It wouldn't work nearly as well for something that was already mostly red, green, black, etc. You can hue shift but that's even more complex and can have odd results.
---
Not to say that any of this is, or was, impossible, or even all that difficult, but it takes times and resources that then can't be used somewhere else. At the end of the day, there is an effectively infinite number of things you *could* do to improve whatever game you're working on, but time and money are limited so you need to make difficult choices. This goes double for a game as ambitious as WoW was at the time (and frankly still is).
---
Is this a peasent horde joke, I am too alliance to understand?

 **Zug-zug** or **Zug zug** = Acknowledgment and agreement; roughly the equivalent of okay.

This community really is great. I asked for a tailor to make me some linen bags with materials I had... I traded them the linen and thread, and they said “wanna see a magic trick?” At that point I figure he was going to run off with my mats, but... to my surprise, he opened a trade window. The materials I had just given him, plus 4 silk bags were put into that trade window. He made life as a level 9 rogue so much better, I can’t wait until I’m able to pay it forward.

We know it can affect the quilboar, as that's the story of the razorfen instances. And it affects high elves as well, though they turn into banshees or valkyries instead.

Look at the ah for the highest price cloth (or whatever) that you can farm easily. Let’s say for you it is silk.

You should farm the silk, and just buy the wool from ah. (From an economics POV)

idk what game ur playing but everytime i make a group, its always 1 person that just are taking forever to get here because they're nowhere near the dungeon.
---
when u get someone that's at silithus, has to go to booty bay, take boat, fp to thorium point and hes like the 2nd person to join the party so he had all the time to get here while we looked for other members and yet hes the last person to arrive since he took like 20-30 mins after we found everyone... then you'll know what i mean
---
SM/Ruin
---
Because it’s widely known and makes the overall message shorter which people appreciate. If you want to play a community game, you need to learn the specific language of the community. Don’t push the blame on others if you are too lazy to learn something.
---
Yeah that's why I don't really believe them when they say they have all the 1.12 source code. I think they are fibbing a bit on that one.. it doesn't make sense that they would have all the source code yet so much would be wrong.
---
I miss my warlock :(
---
When Dire Maul gets released, you can get your second one too. I don't know the price difference between a warlock's 100% mount and a regular mount, but I'm still fairly certain it's cheaper. Warlocks really were Blizz's favorite class.

If you played a hunter you got fear beast. Why would you want to be on the receiving end?

at 51 so i can get both holy shield and consecration

And then she whispers in you ear "Lok'tar" Hnggg

Meeting Stones didn't get the ability to summon party members until later on. It's not a bug.

There is a give and take, everyone who reads this. Don’t ask them to make bags for other characters. In retail I would ask people if they had my size bag and if I didn;t have the material I would go and get it with them. Wow classic is good, retail has fallen to sin.

Anathema has more Alliance than Horde and it’s a PvP server.
---
“The lad over here” by that I’m assuming you mean literally 99% of Trade chat in every expansion ever that have used and will continue to use “Ench, LW, LFW, LFG, DPS, WTB” 
---
Ask for help or shut up, don’t start crying on Reddit cos you don’t understand stuff in a game.
---
And remember people, it's embarrassing if the tank is ahead of you in damage, so make sure to start attacking as soon as your tank does.
---
Some Gnomes just wanna watch the world burn!
---
What do you mean? The meetingstones that tell you the name and level of the dungeon aren't supossed to do anything.
---
Fun Fact: That video seems to be Fake. Sometime Last Year a video surfaced that looks like they are practicing their lines - it's pretty much the same, just some lines in the video are different and they are laughing when leeroy shouts.
---
Poly, counterspell, and kind of arcane missiles (they do dmg every second, so In pvp it can be useful for spell pushback (doesn’t work on pve mobs)
---
&gt; Mana starts being an issue about level 35. All the int from your gear. 
---
It helps if you are going for +dmg or +frost dmg gear, as it makes your existing mana pool more efficient and doesn't inflate it. For Classic this time around I committed pretty hard to it and from lvl 30 onwards I was 3-shotting mobs 2-3 levels above me if I crit.

/who tells u where they are but doesn't tell you if they have hearth to kargath. asking them if they have hearth for every invite is extra time consuming. they should just be good to go or at least somewhat on the way.

There will be plenty when BGs are out. Guildie already sold a PoD for 1k to someone sticking up on twinkstuff haha
---
I don’t know why 5-man ubrs isn’t more common, nice bis gear
---
So far the only time I've been topped on the dungeon damage meters is against 2 dps arms warriors in UBRS who blew me and everyone else away by a significant margin. They're pretty nuts.
---
Thats a great buy, i check everyday but it havent been offered on my servers AH yet.
---
Many of the GMs I am in contact with on my server, we all communicate to put MC and Ony runs together, are reporting as high as about 50%  decreases in guild activity. That is memebers being online, not leaving the guild etc.
---
agree, people just overblown druid innefectiveness and parrot others. They are competent healer, can tank and offtank pretty much everything and even the "oomkin" can reach extremely high amount of damage if the fight doesn't last too long. (and fights are shorter than before thanks to everyone being better and in 1.12)
---
I’ve been playing this game for like 2 days, and have never played before in the past. Almost everyone on here is just coming back to it from childhood and expects people like me to know what all of this means. It’s not that I don’t know, that comes with playing the game, but fuck you for judging me for replying with the wrong shit because I got the acronym wrong.
---
I want to vomit. That can't be real.. can it?
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Yeah ive been talking to my friends about it and it wasnt that I stopped liking WoW. Its that I hated what WoW turned in to. It really is just an amazing game and even 15 years later it holds up. It isnt perfect by any means but it has a lot of charm and it truly gives you that feeling that youre in the world of warcraft.
---
RIP
---
Affliction until Dark Pact is pretty much optimal for every aspect of what you'll be doing while leveling. Drain tanking with succubus out keeps you protected during PvP encounters, and is optimal even besides. Dungeons you just multi-target DoT corruption + spam shadow bolt / rain of fire, and use imp as a mana battery to save your healer some grief.
---
As Alliance, lock is gonna be rough on a PvP server until 42. After you get death coil, you can win pretty much any 1v1 as long as you are prepared.
---
I agree that they don't need buffs necessarily, it was more to flex on the Horde. I was responding more to "wasting" LoE. I don't think I've seen a better use of that item ever, most people who got it in classic kept waiting and waiting and never ended up actually using it for some actually cool shit like this.
---
very nice!!!!! Heartwarming!
---
Or the Fleshripper from Westfall, i travelled at lvl 19 to Westfall (swimming from bootybay!) to get it. Screech is absolutely insane! It also can use Bite and Dash later! :)
---
haha yea ;/ he even died @ the end :P
---
There are alot of bad seeds i tell ya
---
That was my point. Current single player leveling and dead zones in many MMOs are caused by non-repeatability of most content, either because it's one time content or rewards stop being enticing. Even Classic will see this soon based on pservers, most people will be 60 and either chilling in capital cities or spending their time in endgame instances. Few people who'll be leveling at this point would be locked out of group quests and dungeons.
---
Power is pretty much the same concept, you're generally at the same power level in rewarding content, but there are tons of content you can overpower with absolutely no reason to do that. What's the purpose then?
---
Yeah probably the vast majority of players never used it. Vast majority of players never did a lot of things. But if you’re trying to be world number 1 absolute meta-defining minmaxers, it’s wasted potential. They’re basically saying it would be better saved for important PvE moments rather than the kind of PvP that’s going to be a several times per week routine, especially in phase 2 Gehennas. On Gehennas, a horde dominated server, Blackrock Mountain is virtually horde controlled 24/7, and APES are KOS for the entire faction. These fights will happen again and next time they won’t have the consume (not cooldown)
---
The only point I was making was to try to clear up where the person you were responding to was coming from. There’s no “again”, since that was my first comment.
---
wrong, cc starts from the bottom up
---
This needs "Down with the sickness" from Disturbed
---
Tiers is usually pvp gear with some good pieces for pve aswell. Exceptions is tanks, resto shamans etc:)
---
Mage Armor also helps improve the usefulness of Spirit, although it can be rather risky to use in the open world.
---
Because Horde has better pvp racial abilities over all
---
Is it possible to buy the collector edition pet codes, and if so, where?
---
TIL the bear dances
---
Where are you farming them?
---
This build is what u do if u intend to spam dungeons. 
---
Consecration first , then Redoubt and Precision. From there it's really up to you. 
---
Imp Righteous Fury is very good too, as is Imp Retribution Aura. 
---
At higher lvls you can consider Blessing of Sanctuary as well as Reckoning.
---
Now reckoning is controversial, but I like it very much. That being said, some paladins don't even take it.
---
TBC, to be exact
---
I'm starting to think that playing a druid would be perfect for me. I like having an option to chose whatever role I'd like during leveling. I won't have much time to play and it will take me months until I'm ready to raid.
---
My hope is that by this time, the content is on farm and so easy already for everybody that cats and even owls would be allowed in raids. 
---
Is this realistic?
---
Theres clearly 40 people in Monkeynews’ raid, and there’s enough people in the other that they can be assigned to clear one side of BRM solo.
---
Words evolve. I had no idea gank meant gang kill because that's not the way its used in my experience. Not sure why it matters though, as it's not a formal word to begin with.
---
wait, you can fight in WSG and others battleground ?
---
Make your own groups and only invite cloth dps/healers :D
---
Oh really? I thought berserkers rage also cancels charm effects. My bad then.
---
It's a nipple, thank you very much!
---
Gutted to hear that! He would be proud of you and Classic.
---
Not ever using the item because you "wait for the right time" is not really an excuse a top tier guild could make. And you will find many better situations that I described above. Even if you disregard PvE and want to use it for PvP, world bosses are far far better use on a hugely horde dominated server for getting the wboss loot, than just for keeping buffs for MC.
---
Yeah that's true then. In a group environment where you're not getting ambushed it's a very good way to break charm and fear.
---
This is true... bunch of fucking Brazilian horde on the United States thalnos server love to attack low levels on the 2nd floor walkway.
---
It is
---
Im Full shadow at 60 and healing all 60 dungeons without issues. I do have pretty decent healing gear by now though.
---
First of all u dont fear in an instance lol and 2nd purple Is sap
---
before, dont let the tank get a head start
---
What did you miss? Collecting 12 appeals, kill 20 pigs?
---
I'm a level 37 Retribution Paladin - which axe is better for general questing and wpvp - Bonebiter or Ravager? I typically use seal of command but note it only procs 7 times per minute. Any thoughts from paladins who have had this dilemma?!
---
To be fair, oomkin problems are less big than before because everyone being better also make the fights shorters.
---
Also, druid bear tanks have been shown able to tank like 90% of the game and offtank everything, so it's not that bad.
---
not really though.
---
The wowhobbs way
---
Or the Flesh Ripper in Westfall, it can use Screech, Bite and Claw. 
---
At lvl 19 i started my journey there with my troll and after some fights with the alliance (obv. 5vs1) i got it.
---
(if you want to do it as well, tame a crab at the shore for Claw (2) and a wolf for Bite (2). But just train your Fleshripper Bite.
---
Oof
---
That....actually is the deciding argument.
---
Yes try eBay.
---
I think it's excellent that the level penalty is very low, it's only fair that lower levels at least have some chance of depending themselves when an idiot several levels above thinks he is on a power trip.
---
&gt; 2 raids of 25, 50 total.

My brother and I we created an UD rogue and they have frenzy. You see an Alliance you go in, not matter the level gap.

So here this level 38 Gnome Warlock making his way to SM and is, both level 8. We went in and died and had a laugh. Maybe this guy had a similar frenzy.

Play what you want and enjoy.

Who cares if there are random people on reddit who are upset

Lucky you, your friend didn't have a meme spec!!
---
Joke aside, that's a great attention man, there's no better way to honor his memory.
---
On 10k pop servers where you have multiple raid pugs going on at any given time, it does seem possible that if the attackers hung around long enough, defenders could be organised into a few raid grips.
---
Damn i just realised im a BiS list-junky aswell... kinda sucks. But yeah, you're right.
---
Go back to your hand holding moms and pops guild before you make s bigger fool of yourself.
---
In about fuck you months
---
Yeah I know. That's why I'm kinda surprised to read stuff like that.
---
No, the binaries are compiled for an x86_64 architecture, not for ARM. Means: The Pi CPU doesn't know how to perform the instructions form the exe file.
---
&gt; people were talking about how people not 60 yet are "behind the curve". Is that true ? 
---
It's not. The majority of the active people should be roughly at 40 (+/- 5lvl) right now. And that's people who play almost daily and are focusing on leveling, not professions or smelling the flowers. Assuming that most people are 60 by now is completely delusional and must've been a joke.
---
See, I heard from the homeless guy on the corner it was actually a 39.76% nerf.
---
Fair enough. I just wouldn’t compare APES to most people, but rather to the high standard they set themselves.
---
Honestly it clears to me you’re using the notion that people don’t understand as you’re chosen conclusion. The reality is they just disagree with you.
---
Still significantly slower than the 60% mount. Farming gold, and leveling, is more efficient when you spend less time traveling. Time is money, friend!
---
Thank you for answering.
---
We had bigger battles on Pservers on no lag at all, if you dont believe it go back to the video and look through his channel you will find dozens of simular situations.
---
Why did I just watch that?

It honestly depends which curve you're on about, in terms of the hardcore curve, you're definately behind. But overall, you're probably a little ahead. Up until 2 days ago I was doing census scans on my server constantly, and the minority of players I scanned were 60. Level 60s made up around 1% of the server or so.
---
TL;DR: Yes, there's still a shit load of lower level players.
---
Being a Rank 1/Extremely high rated arena player does mean some things - It means you understand the game at a high level, it means you're good strategically, good mechanically, all of these things can be useful in other aspects of the game.
---
Experience matters a lot, yes - which is why I said, OVER TIME that gap will probably close, because these good players on Horde will learn strategies that APES are using right now, which they are right now not used to.
---
Yeah, again, private server players are dominating classic in the first month? Who would have thought... These players have done multiple resets - multiple servers, It's not that Method players suck, it's that they have a learning process to overcome. All of these things point towards the point I'm trying to make, Horde retail players will get better over time in these battles.
---
That is one boss from a raid. My point still stands, for dungeons you dont need any cc and can speedrun them with no problems. 
---
If your groups havent been able to do that and have to CC trash mobs to not wipe you might be doing something wrong buddy. Classic PvE content is not challenging at all, there are hardly any mechancis you have to pay attention to and it was made for people who have no idea how to play the game :)
---
Godspeed then :D 
---
Even if i'm impatient to start higher dungeons and raiding, I don't want to rush anything in between
---
As a horde player I think it looks great in its "home makeover" in retail :)
---
(Beautiful city but very inconvinient to use)
---
why is a pve hero like yourself commenting in a thread about pvp
---
fuck "dps meters" and fuck raid logs
---
I know for a fact Progress used this on Heigan dance in Naxx, ultimately beating Apes for the server first Naxx back on the pservers due to this and several other clever tricks. It's just to give an example, you can use this on various different occasions. And of course this went a bit too far, I dont actually care what Apes use it for. I just feel like a guild that Apes claim to be should be using their resources in an efficient manner and this seemed like an amateur move.
---
this is what I love about classic.
---
I mind control people off the boat close to the edge before the loading screen appears.
---
I must be on a lot of kos lists by now :-)
---
Supercool
---
What... Blizzard explicitly stated that it will be a 37.38682% nerf - repeating of course.
---
Don't tell me what to do
---
I sold mine for 300g
---
I put a lot of effort, but I'm unclear how you earned 2k+ gold. That's 100 hours of gold farming, unless you have really good gold farming spots.
---
As long as you didn't abuse layering to earn that gold, it's very impressive. :)
---
This is pure satisfying and the reason why I love Enhancer. Yeah RNG is hate but when it procs.. it procs. I missed on Retail that feeling when WF procs, it was pure joy and satisfying at the same time.
---
What bums me out more is that horde basically have 2x more players grouping for dungeons, quests etc.
---
I couldnt care leas about the ratio and world pvp balance thats not a big deal imo.  Some days on alliance when you cant find groups im reminded that the horde have more players running stuff.
---
Risky click of the day.
---
Waaaaaaaaaaaa I can’t have my dungeons begin instantly. 
---
Seriously. I absolutely hate this mentality. I stopped playing retail to get away from this garbage.
---
Wow ur so mighty. Pls show me how to PvP. 
---
I hate you
---
The only secondary proffesion I picked up is first aid. Im wondering if I should invest my time into fishing+cooking combo now or can I do it at 60 with similar time investment?
---
Yeah that was my feeling too. Thanks for the confirmation :)
---
Well it makes sense. Demon hunters start at high level and this is their grand entrance into the game. If you want a zero to hero experience you could play another class that starts at level 1.
---
35+ is when it starts getting really hard for paladins since the power spike you got from Seal of Command and good 2H weapons is neutralized by high mob health, your talents after that are weak so mobs are getting tougher faster than you are stronger - it gets a lot worse in the 50s. Grouping for quests becomes much more important at this point - find someone who's also starting a zone with you and stick with them.
---
You should make sure you've done every quest you can at your level appropriate areas (south STV, Tanaris, Feralas, Hinterlands). Dungeon quests are very important too, but some of them start in obscure locations which makes them hard to find. You can DPS or tank dungeons, but tanking pre-Consecrate is pretty hard - not impossible though, at least for Uldaman. I 2H tanked Uldaman a few times at 45+ since I really wanted the weapon from the last boss.
---
But really, my best advice to you would be group with someone. Maybe a warrior, who's also struggling with mobs their level. It takes longer to get "Gather X" quests done but you kill mobs at half the time and have significantly less downtime, so it works out.
---
It annoys me when a mage dies and their projects come for me all at once. Other than that, I don't mind them.
---
Muh sexism
---
Me: oh a nice legit question. 
---
Me after reading your post: oh it’s just another ad :(
---
No it wouldn't, a mage polying you by surprise would still be a gank.
---
Calm down, you're wrong. Get over it.
---
APES are the best if not one of the best guilds on Classic WoW right now, can't deny that... however it seems like a lot of people aren't considering the fact that they had most of their raid use "Light of the Elune Potion" which is a one time use that grants 10s immunity, thats why in the raid frames pretty much nobody is taking damage and how they just walked through double the number of horde.
---
Horde made a huge mistake following them but this isn't as impressive as most first think
---
For me Druid is definitely the best class for goofing around. 
---
You can harass a group of players without committing, you can flee, you can win 1on1's with decent pvp stuff and skill, you can solo some content.
---
The combination of having self heal, good mobility, stealth and tanking is unmatched by any other class.
---
What the fuck
---
But I'm struggling to think how useful it would be tactically in World Boss scenarios. Observe that APES used the environment to their advantage (chokepoints forcing Horde to clump up, luring them into lava for a quick takedown) here; but as far as I recall, World Bosses were all out in the open, resulting in much, much more lopsided fights.
---
In fact, until Azuregos was patched to debuff you upon death, one of the most popular ways to kill him was to simply GY zerg the dragon. So 10 secs of invincibility will do dick-smith when you have players constantly spawning behind you constantly.
---
They won here because of force multipliers, and LoE was in fact a tactically sound choice. In open terrain, they might succeed in wiping out one raid only to fold to another flanking them. No, I think APES will use different tactics to corner the WB market; maybe cross-guild cooperation to minimize faction imbalance?
---
As a PR move, this is amazing. Again, this is merely a personal anecdote, but I - a hardcore PvE player who abhors PvP - got the itch to reroll on a PvP server just to do shit like this. It got my blood pumping. And I'm sure for many alliance, who are currently the underdog in PvP servers, this was healthy injection of morale.
---
As to instanced content, I sincerely doubt guilds of this caliber will rely on a one-shot potion to gain a decisive edge over the competition. I can't recall a single phase where it would be crucial (and as far as I know, not everyone even used it - Monkeynews didn't, I think, so I suspect the tanks are in the clear).
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
I see all these posts on people mashing the ignore button for literally no reason. Are people really so thin skinned these days?
---
Congrates man looks awesome! This on stonespine?
---
Looks awesome. I'm also fond of that octopus guild tabard! Congratulations on 40 and your armor set. I've been alting between almost every class in game debating what to main, and now finally settled (I think..)!
---
the problem is that it was needed. Good luck to find people for your dungeon while leveling when everyone is dispatched on 3/4 continent and 90% of the community is max level.
---
leveling became miserable
---
I am not saying you are lying. I just *think* you are wrong. Obviously wowhead could have missing data and I was just unlucky not getting a single drop from them. Thats absolutely a possibility. But based on my experience on how many times people were adamant about stuff that was proven wrong, I will rather assume that the wowhead data is correct for now. If I see a source like wowhead stating otherwise or multiple people reporting it, I will reconsider my stance.
---
Maybe a joke and i've been woosh'd. So lvl 40, professions on track and flower smelled seems ok \^\^
---
Was thinking the same, hes not the only one who used it (pretty sure 90% of their raid did)
---
No, it is not an ad, and I will remove it, if people want to know I guess they will ask for it...
---
&gt; You do realise it takes 20s to break even on the cost for mana spring right?
---
It doesn't. The totem doesn't exist in a vacuum, it functions *on top* of your normal mana regeneration.
---
Bartender
---
How much do you have to drink/eat? Can you kill one or two mobs at at least warrior speed? I am crawling up through 40's and tanking as ret is becoming hard so I am looking for better talents but dont want to render myself useless questing.
---
People do this on Stalagg a lot too and get their weird idea that it means they must be really good?
---
The vast majority of players aren't hanging around main cities. And the ones that are, are split up between who knows how many layers. Furthermore there is no reason to engage on PvP right now, meaning as soon as you go in to camp the FP, or kill auctioneers, they will simply layer hope to avoid you.
---
Basically, faction imbalance is essentially moot while phasing is in the game.
---
Stupid fucking brony, get out of here
---
The prototype is probably possible with hearing and sight similar to certain VR. I just want motion in game without getting out of bed. Strap myself down and maybe nerve inputs directly to the game character?
---
Doesn't Questie show more than 3 quests at a time? Just get addons to make the small changes you want, no need for Blizzard to do that.
---
This is like.. brain damaged child levels of unfunny.
---
How does an epic mount help you in raids.....
---
&gt;That's not an excuse to use words incorrectly.
---
It's not a formal word to begin with, so your point is moot
---
&gt;Can I just use words however I like and then claim the definition to me is different?
---
If enough people agree with you, then yes, that's how language works. It's a means to communicate. If I told someone I saw a really gay guy 50 years ago, they'd assume I meant a really happy guy. Today, it obviously has a different meaning, because words evolve and change.
---
&gt;I didn't make a big deal out of it to begin with, everyone just wanted to argue and dog-pile.
---
I mean, you're arguing relentlessly with anyone you can, so I'd say it's not so one sided. You chose to die on this hill. I just thought I'd point out what a dumb hill it is.
---
cuz they didn't play anything else than vanilla this whole time, geez ... who will be better at swordfighting? Modern soldier or some samurai guy from the past?
---
I rerolled a 35 shaman for a paladin who is now 29, I feel pretty much ok with not being 60. I will be 60 once phase 2 hits, which is all that matters really.
---
If you take out (rank 9) and just leave it as Frostbolt it will cast your highest level you have.
---
Unsubbing #nochanges
---
Circle is the bronze nipple
---
And by harder you mean still trivial if the rest of your group knows has any idea at all how to play. Offspec healers were healing UBRS and Dire Maul a decade and a half ago.
---
Same loo
---
I want to reroll mage each time I see one doing aoe farming or getting slowed/rooted to oblivion when fighting one...  
---
But I can't for the life of me restart the leveling right now. That'll have to wait till I'm 60 and geared :)
---
Nevermind the viruses.. Think of all the ads spamming your brain.
---
How come? I'm kinda new and on horde. 
---
Why is alliance so much stronger?
---
But world bosses aren't released in 2 weeks or in Phase 2.
---
It's definitely realistic. The game just doesn't have enough to justify tryharding over playing the race/class/spec combination that you like.
---
Classic leveling is hard, if you end up with a lvl60 character that you don't like it's just not a good investment of your time.
---
Moon fire harder
---
At level 43 you should've gained a massive boost to your healing thats entire specc independent via BoL and the ability to remove magic via cleanse. 
---
Regarding Retribution, GET HITRATING. I've explained it in another post but SoCommand and Revenge will suffer without the ability to hit ttargets even more then other classes. You can specc 3% in protection. I strongly encourage you to get those if you plan on continuing with retribution. 
---
Other options are going in Prot up to reconning and then filling up the holy tree to consecration. At 43 you might consider just going for 21pts prot and then going for consecration. Now you'll be able to AOE farm sorta like a mage. Gather up 8 mobs - reflect/consecrate them down -drink/eat -repeat. 
---
This specc also allows you to tank, heal and once you get Reconning even solo kill stuff. While you killtime for single mobs will be slower then ret, your better against higher or equal level targets.
---
Regarding guides, I assume you use Judgements? Pretty good, used it myself. But I also noticed that during the 40+ phase he relied more on yellow quests and questchains he set up almost 10 levels ago.
---
This. Pretty simple.  If you’re a tank it’s trivial to set it up so you’re the only plate wearer. This is the best way to sort out your fury prebis. Don’t feel too bad for the DPS warriors LFG, it won’t take long for them to figure out they can and should just tank their dungeons.
---
 If you must bring a pala just talk loot with them quickly beforehand. Just saying that you’re fury should clear things up.
---
Gos this is so fucking cool. I love this game so much. So much respect to the precision and organization and dedication these players have. 
---
To end on a negative note though... god the fucking comments in thread. Jesus christ.
---
While this is true, I would like to point out that "the first few raids" will keep your average raiding guild busy for 1-2 years, depending on when AQ opens and when you really stop farming BWL for gear.
---
Being a mage myself you should really not roll this class if you think "I'll just play frost for this short little while and wait for AQ to launch for my real spec". 
---
Just a friendly reminder that the frost raiding period is quite long.
---
Thanks for the confirmation !
---
How does getting an epic mount help in getting World First in the next phase (BWL)?
---
Don't worry, dwarf females aren't real, it must be some kind of trick.
---
I still think its weird that stuff like SunkenTemple's classquests are not in
---
So you too know the mage I had in my group yesterday?
---
Bloodmoon's rogue spreadsheet [http://www.mediafire.com/file/x3snc96eqssiz4f/RogueDPS\_Bloodmoon\_v.1.7.xls/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/x3snc96eqssiz4f/RogueDPS_Bloodmoon_v.1.7.xls/file)
---
why would you even think this
---
I think problems may arise if both healer and tank are off-spec. And Warrior is trying to tank with 2h. Mix in AOE and things  can go wrong.
---
Lmao stop whiteknighting for some dumbass neckbeards, they knew exactly what they were buying
---
And I was just laughing at it tbh 😋
---
Yea I feel it. Ofc it’s all subjective but I get you.
---
Yikes. I was in a top 100 US mythic raiding guild in retail. I am aware of what a hardcore raiding guild is/requirements are. Mounts were definitely not a requirement to have a raid spot.
---
Good job! 👍
---
Your moooving on up!
---
Am I the only one noticing aspect of the cheetah here?
---
yep. by adding in honor before bgs... APES will literally own the world.
---
1.12 is where classic ended, then came tbc prepatch with 2.0  
---
There is nothing missing from vanilla, however some content is going to be available [later](https://www.wowhead.com/news=290629/staggered-classic-content-update-six-phases-up-from-four-to-address-itemization-) to emulate progression through patches
---
damn those damn onion cutting ninjas :(
---
nah dude, this guy had 30ms and 200fps! that's for sure
---
Its not so black and white. There are more outcomes to increasing power than just coming back 10 levels later and one shotting everything. 
---
Taking on areas 3-4 levels higher than you can be a fun challenge. Or trying to solo elite areas. 
---
Sometimes you want to do some easier questing just to relax. 
---
Or just the effect of seeing how your character is getting stronger when you come back to an area that kicked your ass the day before. 
---
This sort of effect is completely lost when everything scales to your level and imo a valuable part of the levelling experience.
---
I believe he's referring to this
---

The quick fix for theorycraft.
---
The dungeons after SM aren't worth grinding for exp?
---
I play on Gehennas EU Horde side and can confirm that entering Ungoro is a no-no
---
Actually best leveling pet is an Owl ! In raid situations hunters tend to pick a wolf for the damage buff to everyone, otherwise broken tooth is the best pvp pet because of the pushback he can put to caster classes, leveling with him in BM  spec is so funny, but I have a question tho, does he do less damage per tick than a regular cat ?
---
You should pick up cooking as it will save you a lot of cash on food while levelling, and also affords you cheap stam/spirit buffs. You'll also be getting cooking supplies as drops and recipes as quest rewards.  
---
Cooking also generates gold. For example, Tiger Meat vendors for 60c, but when cooked in to Jungle Stew, the stew vendors for 3s; one meat makes 2 stews, turning the 60 copper into 6 silver.
---
I recommend getting fishing to get you through the first stretch of cooking, but saving the rest of it for when you're 60 (unless you really want a lot of Deviate Fish).
---
High level fishing is the only way to get Stonescale Eels, which are required for top-end elixirs and flasks, and the only source agility buff food, strength food, and mp5 food.
---
I know I forgot to take off the waiting text, my bad
---
If by bugged you mean that they can't be used to summon people, that's working as intended. That functionality wasn't in vanilla, they're called "meeting stones".
---
I had a neighbor growing up who has CP and we used to play fighting games together like mortal Kombat he had an arcade style game pad to use. This was back in the 90's before they started making accessibility friendly items/tech for gaming.
---
Oh yeah, I've believed that for a while now, but it was still huge at the time.
---
You can absolutely cast Demoralizing Shout in Defensive Stance
---
So this is why barrens chat is the way it is
---
I dunno. The succubi still spank themselves and moan.
---
Why?, many that play on a pvp server do it because they like they added challenge, it's more about surviving than killing.
---
You, uh, you saw that they had like 3 raids camping them before they even got to the instance? You don't teleport to raids automatically. You kinda have to get in, and preferably keep your world buffs.
---
Epic mounts are HUGE when it comes to maneuvering in open world content. If you don't have them, but the opposing faction does, they can chase you down, lock down your raid, pave the whole raid night with your bones.
---
If you have them, but they don't, you can run rings around the Horde, move away from ambushes, and generally keep them a step behind.
---
And if you both have them, then you're denying the numerically superior opponent (almost every single PVP server is horde-dominated) a crucial advantage. And you need to eliminate every single advantage they have if you actually want to GET to the raids.
---
You'll see how it is when DM launches. It was absolutely infamous on pservers as a gank spot, with horde cock-blocking alliance every step of the way, to the point where you'd just hope to run into the instance as a ghost.
---
Cooking can provide you with buff food that might help a bit while leveling. But other than that, you are probably faster doing it at a higher level, as low level mobs won't aggro while fishing, you get to the right spots faster with a mount and all/most flight points already discovered and you probably have the spare cash for all the recipes/books and more inventory space.
---
However, if you like fishing, it can be a nice change of pace in between questing or while waiting for a dungeon group or generally filling downtimes.
---
is it some interface option or class based? im playing rogue and stuff automatically is at max level as soon as I upgrade it
---
In my experience, even if you're tanking dungeons, no one seems to mind you needing on BIS DPS gear, even other warriors. I imagine they understand you're DPS too, but you tanking instead for the benefit of everyone in the group.
---
Totally camped you for a bit. Feelsbadman
---
&gt; Farming gold, and leveling, is more efficient when you spend less time traveling. Time is money, friend!
---
The sky is blue and water is wet. A lot of the travelling you do on a mount is &lt; 25 seconds between quest areas. There's the rare long trek across a zone but travel for is better than normal mount when you're going to be travelling for &lt; 25 seconds. AFter that, obvious it's better but not by huge amounts.
---
I levelled my druid to 60 using travel form and was able to keep up with my friends on their mounts.
---
I love doing that . One time there was 3 hordes refusing to let me leave Ratchet after I arrived from booty Bay. I think someone said in general what I had done and that I needed to be punished because they where only harrasing me and no one else :p
---
Every time I tried to cross the bridge and get to the flight path they would attack me and I had to run back to the boat where the guards stand not to die. I tried waiting for the next boat and wait for more alliance and run with them, but that didn't work either. They just ignored everyone but me.
---
While it was a little frustrating, it was pretty hilarious that I had MCed so many that they felt the need to do that :D
---
Ya, it this was a normal guild asking that it'd be dumb but Apes will be dealing with ganks like this every week and mounts will make a massive difference. 
---
That been said I wonder at what point its just not worth getting world buffs for these raids due to how easy a clear they're
---
Sorry to hear about your friend. But I bet he couldn’t think of a better way to carry on his memory. Happy hunting friend.
---
I’d say mage or Druid. 
---
A couple mages can hold off a choke point for a while, or stop a cap/ruin a commander attempt. 
---
With a Druid you can just switch your gear and be a tanky pest sitting on flags spamming swipe, you can pick people off, or heal that warrior that is demolishing the enemy team.
---
Some people make new accounts just to have a spy character to know what ally is doing or their info is posted on discord which wouldn't be too hard to find.
---
I need to change the font of my "damage numbers" like his. I always wanted to do so. Can someone tell me how to do it? Ty
---
8 levels below boss level is simply dead weight you have to carry, no matter what they are wearing. They won't even get much XP here either, since Skull and Red enemies give way less (if any).  Don't know what he expected
---
It got changed in BC btw
---
Helps you get to them faster, helps you clear the Horde guild on one side and then get to the other Horde guild before they can regroup or share information.
---
I'm not saying it's a MUST for every single guild out there, but the way all the other Horde guilds are targeting them and trying to interrupt their raids, I think it's clear that it is IMPORTANT for their guild and the way they play.
---
It's barely been a day and this format has been run to the ground. Reddit is just terminally unfunny and incapable of original thought.
---
&gt;  If you're in a group where they expect you to hold agro during AOE groups, they're doing it wrong, not you. 
---
Thank you! I've been having a mid-levelling crisis because I couldn't always hold aggro while the mage blasts it down with Blizzard and two warriors Ravager-whirlwind everything around me. Was wondering what am I dowing wrong for the past week.
---
Classic league haha
---
yeah that was incredible.
---
The fucks a brony bruh
---
Any thoughts on how the the battle ground asymmetry would impact this decision? I have vague memories of different dynamics between the factions.
---
Alter-Rack Mountains would have worked better
---
They redid the textures, models, etc for ALL humans at one point.
---
I agree and I think that the game should downscale you for lower level content rather than scaling everything to your level. Original comment was against level scaling in general.
---
If you can find a competent, fast group, sure, but dungeons get more complex and less forgiving as you advance. SM is the last series of dungeons I would expect the average mouth-breather to not screw up without constant supervision.
---
Watch the clip eh mate?:)
---
yes tons of these guys stream on twitch. all their mc runs are in vods. easy to locate.
---
This is how memes work. It gets overused until everybody is fed up with it after a few days. I am just doing my part to keep the big wheel turning.
---
You're writing this on a thread about a literal army of horde players trying to prevent those players from reaching the raid instance with a bunch of extremely powerful out-of-raid buffs.
---
More buffs with stuff like +140ap and +5% crit chance are obviously better.
---
This guy has got to be trolling. Clearly you can see that there are 2 raids of 33.33 people.
---
Purple cobras? This on bigglesworth?
---
I always hide my usual action bars and use either bars that have only abilities/ items with cooldowns on them or use weakauras that show my cooldowns.
---
I follow the sentiment: when i can use it and dont need info about it, its NOT shown.
---
for example i dont have my mana and hp shown when its at 100% and im out of combat.
---
no clutter on my screen :)
---
I thinks youre right.
---
The Level issue is not denieable with gear.
---
OUTRAGE
---
yep. but reddit won’t like this comment.
---
It was in shimmering flats, adn remember that at one point they redid EVERYTHING about all human npc models. It's likely just something overlooked when adapting the retail client back to classic.
---
If that's Daisy on the left, where the fuck is she in that screenshot
---
Are you trolling?
---
They had to do manual work to get the old character models and animations to work in the new client, even though the files were right there
---
But great! Nothing triggers gamers more than putting more clothes on female characters. This thread once again proves it
---
Thank you.:)
---
Need Warlock advice please :) 
---
Everyone seems to joke what a laughable item the Firestone is... am I missing something, for dungeons where in primarily throwing down fire based AoE, is the +17 fire damage for spells etc? Or only physical damage dealt? 
---
Thanks
---
I'm also mainly a PvE player, but world PvP like this is one of the best fun I have in the game right now. Let me paint a picture for you though.
---
Usually how world bosses went down on private servers is that there are 2 coalitions of guilds fighting each other, without collusion that would be alliance vs horde although there usually was a colluding group of guilds between horde and alliance. This is why the fights took so long - they just wipe each other, making sure no one finishes the boss. I think it's safe to assume on a horde dominated server like Gehennas that there will be several horde guilds trying to fight apes for it. It usually goes like this - one horde raid engages on Azuregos while the other ones try their best to keep Apes off the boss, since it's inefficient to have too many people fighting Azuregos due to high AoE damage and the teleport spell he does. Even if Apes charged into the defending raids, they would be too low afterwards to get the boss down. With Light of Elune, they could easily pop it, wipe the defending raids and still be healthy enough to take down the world boss along with the remaining horde. Wiping all the enemies at the same time is crucial for Azuregos because of the death debuff that effectively doesnt let you ress, effectively giving them enough time to kill the boss and claim the loot. This scenario actually went down many times on private servers (not really with LoE but with excessive use of various consumables) and I think it would make for a far far cooler video than this.
---
Crazy how many people with passed loved ones all had the same idea. My dad passed away this year and I instantly reserved his favorite characters name just like many of y’all did. I never got the chance to play vanilla, but he did and that’s where it all started for him. He and I played together a ton growing up, and I’m always hoping I can make a good name for his character now in classic. If you see a “zombiez” on Rattlegore don’t be afraid to say hi!
---
Because star is 100% shackle, fight me!
---
watch the video dork
---
Quick dummy question - can you change the size of these icons? I find them all to be too big.
---
Im sure theres an addon for it, but if anyone knows one ???
---
I'm really happy I came back after all these years, wow classic has been very fun so far. 
---
The improvements to the engine are great and I love the look of the game and how it feels like it hasn't aged much over all these years.
---
Biggest thing I'm looking forward to is the pvp BGs, but that's still a couple of months away, which should be ample time to get to lvl 60 on my cute little paladin, currently 29 :)  I'm happy with where I am currently, just need to get my engineering leveled more, which I will do soonish :P
---
I personally have not run into much toxicity as you put it, it's entirely up to you if you want to be part of the toxic crowds or not, you can just as easily ignore them completely imo.
---
Precisly
---
Stop by senjin, pick up quests, I go ahead and do kolkar quest.  Then off to razor hill, go kill kul tirans quest, grab quest item from chest at top of castle for free double quest.  Go scavenge toolboxes in the sea, there's makruras and crawlers there for one of the senjin quests too.  Theres also a quest in razorhill to grab raptor eggs from echo isles grab that before you head back to senjin, you should be good to go through the echo isle quests.
---
They had 60s before the first week was up. I had my 60 around day 8. I hit 60 with over 300 gold and they had more time to get even more farming done. 
---
With how long its been its not a bad expectation. I got a character on my horde server sitting at near 100g at level 15 because I just fish while Im working since its low maintenance. Epic mount isnt too bad.
---
You already have peripherals (monitor, mouse, keyboard), or are these part of your budget?
---
Green Dye or Yellow Dye.
---
I don't know why it was so hard to make a yellow dye icon.
---
ONE ON ME. ON ME.
---
Your AOE spells have terrible spell-power ratios. You'll need over 100 spell power to notice a difference in your Hellfire or Rain of Fire.
---
Put in stairs. Or just poopoo Outlands, keep level cap at 60, and spread the reworked instances in the classic world.
---
Basic raidleading for the top private server guilds
---
We cleared MC within one Ony Buff, so thats fine. But what impresses me most is that they all have Epic mounts. They must have abused layering really hard.
---
Most active players now have one (unless you are a warlock like me and wait until you are Darnassus Exalted) but there are usually always slackers who don't have one.
---
i can wait 5 mins for a hearth to kargath + mount to instance but wtf 30 mins, that is a no no. disrespectful to all the other party members
---
&gt;'formal word' is literally something you pulled out your ass.
---
Oh yeah, me and Google both. That's why when you Google a definition it says whether the word is formal or informal English. It's a conspiracy to make you look like a tool (it's totally working too).
---
&gt;Go figure, there are multiple people on each side of what gank means. I'm going with the original definition, people who are ignorant are going with a usage they prefer. 
---
Lol though if downvoted are any indication, you're on the losing side. I guess change is hard for some people. Cling away, dude. You die on that hill.
---
Because the real PvP heroes accidentaly jump into lava and die with buffs ;)
---
Flightpaths so pretty much any tiny city
---
Alt-Mount at lvl 1(60%)
---
Regular Mount at 20,epic at 40
---
You can get back alive without spirit ress, just requires an extra death first when retriving your corpse.
---
None - Don't attack, got it.
---
&gt;Epic mount mandatory in 2 weeks.

*Min*imize your weaknesses, *max*imize your strengths.

Why do cloth users mine my nodes? I need to lvl my bs for my guild. :(
---
I think the overall numbers favor the alliance but only slightly

Now I want to start a guild called Cleavegate.

Plenty of good comms out there. They just arent the ones posting content sadly.

literally watch the video. they are moving as a pack to preserve their world buffs. if you don’t have it you don’t move with the pack and you die and lose your buffs.
---
of course not its full of reddit dads that now everything better and dont like when Blizzard is getting called out because they cant do no wrong. If they all get to 60 in half a year and latest at AQ opening we will see the whining threads. Its embarassing that the game cant handle a huge amount of players.
---
Blutosmash SMASH!!
---
only 2 weeks late.
---
Most of them are just passing throu tbh
---
Was killed several times, didnt even bother reacting, they were gone and prolly even in another instance when I got to the corpse
---
autists having extra accounts to spy on horde.
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
&gt;I'm too old for this to be funny
---
But too young to not report/ignore it if it wiuld happen to you i assume
---
Letsbld.com is nice
---
Was in a run in UBRS, a hunter won dal rends swords over  rogue...... hunters are still king of fuckers
---
Nethertheless, before I have my BiS offhand, my current is +14 so for my AoE the Firestone will be better while levelling? Or no?
---
Sailed from Ratchet to Booty Bay like this. My assassin got drstroyed by the guards.
---
I downloaded Spy last night, and already my KoS has 4 names.
---
Is it the new way conforming with PC? I always thought LFM was looking for men. More consistent with LFG.
---
Buy a mac, those are the best gaming pcs
---
Player-Models |= NPC-Models. Lots of old NPCs even in Retail have no updated Models.
---
Engineering, or auctioning.
---
1 raid vs 4 and you still find ways to critique it lol. Yikes.
---
Triangle also = Banish
---
Yes
---
Honestly I don't know. I've played it on both side but it's been quite while.
---
The main difference I can think of is the bridge toward Stormpike's fortress where you could mindcontrol people and make them jump.
---
Try zf graveyard or the place in mara with tirtles and all
---
This is awesome!
---
I’ve been having other mages sabotage my pulls sadly. Once I have a bunch of mobs nova’d and cast blizzard, they start pulling a bunch of other mobs into my blizzard so I can’t kill them all and I run out of mana ):
---
WPL, Hearthglen, part of the Tirion Fordring quest chain
---
I just reached lvl 40 with my Orc Rogue and I really want to have a mount but I am missing 30G. Whats the best way for me to farm that gold right now?
---
The only times it's useful is when you don't have a good offhand slot item, and the encounters are mostly AoE (which is popular at the moment).
---
Once you have an offhand that has like 15 spell damage, all the firestones will become obsolete.  
---
The melee aspect can be clutch in pvp, but is generally worthless as you won't be using melee.
---
It also costs a shard.
---
Did it with a group where I had a similar situation. If we just had one or two dps that was an acceptable level we should've been able to clear it but since everyone except me was underleveled we didn't do so well :/:/ It was just fun that the dude thought that paladins couldn't heal dungeons haha
---
... And?
---
I did
---
"epic mounts your you'rem not raiding"
---
So they would rather have them buy mounts than boes? What a joke.
---
More than 2 raids, you forgot the stream nuthuggers that are with them as well.
---
" you dont get better just fighting easy wins, im not a horde player "
---
I play on a server where world pvp is just people being jerks with no escalation. The only thing happening is my KoS list on Spy is growing.
---
40% can be faster if grinding jobs or farming herbs/mining as you don't have cast time, also ppl usually farm dungeons anyway
---
It’s not about faction but human individuals. The factions are rather well balanced with strengths and weaknesses both.
---
Yep. He traded me immediately.
---
I'd just say "ok?" and then /ignore if he kept sending asinine shit.
---
This is the best use of LoE I've seen. If you've got the item, why never use it? Should they wait until there's 200 horde there? But what if the next time it's 300? What if theres 400.. See where I'm going with this? There's always going to be a better theoretical way to use LoE.
---
It's still very impressive that they managed to break horde when being outnumbered so heavily. Their leadership is great and the guild members all respect the raid leader which is what made this so epic to see.
---
Just some dumb private server guild who cheated their way to 60 along with cheating their way to gear
---
Was hoping someone had already said this.
---
Dungeons aren't difficult enough to have to optimise the specs of everyone, as long as you have a tank and a heal, you could be 3 retladin and still clean it.
---
As for raids, a retladin is worse than others dps, but as again, right now, you don't need an optimized rosters. Being a paladin with blessings alone mean that you'll have a raid spot without too much trouble.
---
I hope to get tier 2 on my paladin, because it's such an iconic looking set and actually probably the best set as well. But I'm not someone that enjoys raiding so I'll probably just get pvp gear :P
---
its like planning a course for for the uss auto-walk when shes opening the map.
---
I need a new keyboard and mouse
---
the only 2 options for a paladin tbh
---
You need to learn to read usernames dude. I never said any of that lol
---
Rolled a Warrior as I thought it would give me the opportunity to get more groups and progress as time goes on.
---
I have a limited playing schedule and have limped to level 15... at what point does it get easier?
---
I've never played Warrior on Retail so I'm not sure what really possessed me to do it here!
---
Should I reroll?
---
I'm happy you can at least wear a shirt under it or a tabard over it.
---
Can we get ab F for wiggles? He will be remembered!👏👏👏
---
To be honest not having a mount as a shammy isn't a big disadvantage. If you've specced for the 1sec cast time Ghost Wolf you'll be fine. I think in a situation of using Ghost Wolf vs Mount it's only worth using a mount if you're going to be travelling for longer than 25 seconds (i think that was the crunch point, it's atleast around there).  
---
Lok'tar Ogar brother!
---
Go watch the video where Omar explains in good English how they developed Classic.
---
It’s not a secret.
---
They took the current (retail) client and made things work like they do on a 1.12 reference client.
---
If you have any idea about programming you will understand the complexities of emulating old behaviour in new source code. If you don’t have any idea about programming, then you don’t have any idea what you’re talking about.

Keep questing. Gold income rises rapidly from 40 onwards
---
you are both wrong, end of story. 
---

---
sorry updated my post
---
Nice! So was the 7 days /played pure heads down, ass up levelling, or did you relax a little bit? Just asking as I've just started leveling my Priest and was actually looking for an accurate measure to base my /played time off of.
---
Did you mainly quest, dungeon grind or a bit of both? Did you use a questing addon, helper or any sort of guide? 
---
Which, if any, professions did you level on your wat to 60? What spec did you play (any respecs?) and what spells did you find you didn't need to train on your levelling process?
---
I am hoping for a similar /played myself, hence the thousand questions! Would love your feedback, and congrats on 60!
---
Aye, they certainly won't be able to come out of the same situation again as well as they did this time. 
---
&gt; Horde made a huge mistake following them but this isn't as impressive as most first think
---
Aye that was likely a move of desperation (and hopefully) and lack of clear leadership/direction of the Horde raid. They didn't look any more coordinated than pug-PvP raids made for the same reason.
---
There are addons/guides, that will help with being more efficient while questing (stuff like questie, guidelime etc.).
---
However, don't turn the leveling process into a race unless that really is what you are enjoying. Exploring the world, doing stuff that doesn't provide xp but helps with immersing yourself into the story and the world can be really fun and for many players that is at least part of what made classic so special. WoW isn't a race, but it doesn't need to be a marathon either, it can be a weeks/months long enjoyable journey if you make that your focus and not the xp/hour or hours/level.
---
Go DPS.  It was pretty common back in vanilla to have arms warriors tanking pretty much everything that wasn't a raid.  Collect tanking gear though, because if you do have a sword and board, in a pinch you can still throw it on for that extra boost to tank better on harder hitting mobs.
---
PS that top quote is courtesy of [Chigurgh from No Country For Old Men](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/129648-i-have-no-enemies-i-dont-permit-such-a-thing) which is is a great book and definitely worth a read for anyone who is a fan of American literature and always secretly resented the concept of punctuation

it's actually really interesting how people interpret the situation, personally, I place spending time with the Mrs over playing wow.. but I still enjoy both. So I prefer to play wow when I can't be with the Mrs (ie, she's sleeping)

If you communicate this it ain't bad tank could just leave skull to be stunned and bursted during the stuns it's alright tank can ignore the mob alltogather

---
Put the trap to the side away from other mobs, stand behind the trap and dist/aimed/arcane square  into it.  Use LoS if its a caster mob. Renew trap if needed. Dont fd if the trap gets resisted or breaks early, it will go to healer due to healing aggro probably, try to kite it or run to tank.
---
You actually took the time and effort to change your first reply to him, just two add the first two bits which make you sound super salty, just cause he called out your advert...
---
That’s fucking amazing
---
Same. I was in a dungeon group yesterday. 
---
I noticed, the group really gets to learn each other and find the harmony WHILE forming and WHILE going to the destination. 
---
This is when 9/10 times it shows you “is this a talkative group” “do we have good chemistry” whatever... but I am also 9/10 the group leader and the one pushing the chat, showing the way as guide etc. 
---
So I really notice when the chat doesn’t speak... and it became such a bummer in retail. 
---
I remember thinking I was done with the game when I noticed people felt it was a waste of time to say even reply on your messages.
---
World first was done a long time ago...
---
Helps you in exactly these kinds of situations. It makes it easier to safely travel to a raid instance with your buffs intact as well as making it more likely you arrive on time for the open world bosses (Kazzak, Azuregos, Emerald Dragons etc.).
---
Here's your list of spell power ratios:  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/
---
Hellfire has a 2.2% per tic ratio and Rain of Fire has an 8.25% per tic ratio.
---
Your spell power is providing 1 damage per 4 tics for Hellfire, and 1 damage per tic for Rain of Fire.
---
Until you get triple digit spell power, it's entirely insignificant and you'll probably get more use out of int/stam to increase your mana pool, survivability and crit chance.
---
You're continuing the same point made by another guy, so again really does apply.
---
And no, there is no more important PvE moment for this. They've mastered every encounter on private servers levels of overtuned difficulty. They cleared MC without a single wipe with a bunch of guys in greens and sub-60's. The players on their way to the raid are quite literally an obstacle greater than the raid itself.
---

by the time you get to wpl to aoe farm you should be deep enough into prot tree to have improved concentration aura. Still won't solve the problem 100% but it's better than nothing.

I afk'd while flying somewhere in northrend and ended up with my body way off coast, took me several runs out there to get back without spirit healer
---
Do you know what the onyxias buff is? If so, you would understand that this is crippling. Not simply hindering them from getting there. Every death loses massive amounts of bonus stats.
---
you are naive if you think retailers will catch up anytime soon. These players all have years of experience and is one of the most dedicated guilds in wow.

For now retail babies will be farmed.

---
I'd keep it! You can earn gold but it's hard to replace luck like that, especially when to get it back you might end up paying more than you made. Plus, it's always cool to remember stuff like this happening. I remember getting the celestial serpent drop when I was just soloing old raids out of boredom. Of course I didn't get the option to sell it as those drops are soulbound anyways, but I would've kept it regardless.
---
I sold the armor kit for 40 silver on the auction house!

I'm all for running instances at lower levels for the challenge, but that's really pushing it. I would have probably given it a try before quitting, but I can get your frustration.
---
The only beast I see here is struthunters Pet

Unless he's going pvp
---
A sword is just a mace where someone decided to sharpen the hilt.
---
While that could work, you still forget how hard it can be to get gear, especially in a 40man raid. If a shadow priest needed like the whole set to compete with mages late game, it's very unlikely most priests would ever achieve that.
---
found the pleb irl
---
World bosses aren't phase 1 or phase 2.
---
They moved as a pack at basically the same mount speed. Epics slightly faster in the front, but otherwise all the same.
---
Yeah but I doubt it's gonna take 5 mins extra to find a prot specced warrior and a resto specced shaman since both those talent builds are really horrible to level with except if you are purely running instances or spending a lot of gold to jump back and forth with their talents.
---
There are so much players on every level atm, it doesn't really matter where the curve is tbh.
---
I lost my LBRS bow to a Warrior that Need rolled and no one batted an eye. There would be absolute hell and I’d get blacklisted for rolling on Dal’rends over Warriors and Rogues.
---
Fuck entitled Warriors and Rogues.
---
Congrats, but got to ask, what would you have done if that wasn't the quest to hit 60 and you were \~1 xp off?
---
Yeah, but that's overcomplicated because you need to emulate another hardware architecture:
---
I don't think there's a type 1 hypervisor for arm architecture (or rapsberry pi in specific), but you are able to install a type 2 hypervisor on a raspberry pi to emulate a amd64 architecture for windows.
---
Now you have a type 2 hypervisor emulating an architecture on a slow raspberry pi. I bet it's possible to start wow on a raspberry pi, but it won't last long (overheating) and the time it works it'll be unplayable.
---
tldr:
---
It won't work the way you want it to
---
Maybe we should have a "I made the boat" tag then so I can filter out the funny haha's from the boat circlejerk. I mean, humor implies that it is funny and that it hasn't been done a thousand times before.

Too slow for what? For someone having other stuff to do? 
---
I took a week of for launch and hit 60 in 7days played. 
---
Id say i was slow among the fast people. 
---
And id say you are fast mong the slow people. 
---
I base that on something i recall about ”typically people are lvl 30 after 2 days played” 
---
That would be a medium Level for medium people. 
---
Idk. Have fun with it i guess.
---
 A tip for you, if you haven't already get alchemy and tailoring on the druid. Level 35 means you can learn 300 skill. So mooncloth and arcanite transmutes. Also a druid can teleport to moonglade for the mooncloth transmute. Pretty much makes druid the ultimate transmute character.
---
 I play a warlock but I leveled up a druid to 35 for this specific purpose. Alchemy is also a money maker even leveling it up before having transmute. Depends on server of course but mid level alchemy stuff like lesser invisibility potions, frost oil potion, mighty troll blood potion etc will earn cash.
---
Hey guys, check this guy out with his reasonable *grey* opinion! Am I right? Am I right or what? What an idiot, doing both things and not hating one / telling other people how to play their game for 0 reason
---
Will consider a faction change lol
---
Druids are Blizzard fave class
---
Are the queues still that bad that people would rather run afk into a wall and risk death over just getting booted?
---
I refused to start playing classic the first week as I was sure it wouldn't be popular, later my friends convinced me to try and now Im hooked. The community is the best I've ever had while gaming, every piece of gear feels awesome compared to retail and much more.
---
I get frustrated time to time by how unbalanced some things are that won't change due to #nochange, but I still enjoy the game alot.
---
Great reaources, thanks for sharing! 
---
Note, that like both of your links mention, the threat amounts dont take damage into account in some of the values. This means that when your HS does 120 or so damage, you've caught up with sunder in threat as well as contributing to damage and making the mob die faster. I can easily deal 100 or so damage with sunder using a level 20 or so one-hander. Hitting more than 120 shouldn't be too hard at 60.
---
You can also note from the lower link, that when it comes to tps, shield slam is often a potential downgrade. Thus was actually new for me too. 
---
All and all, sunder does great threat when you compare its rage cost (50% of shield slam untalented?), its spammability (wont replace auto attack like hs) and the fact that it does no damage (as opposed to demo, that only does a fraction of it).
---
Thats not funny just pure griefing and I bet you got a lot of report for wasting other peoples time.
---
Wouldn't it have been easier to match the color to the class doing the CC?
---
Most speedlevelers dont enjoy the game like we do brother! Have fun
---
&gt;new overlords
---
youre a few years late to the party
---
No, aq40 and naxx too. We had some super fucking awful players in our guild.
---
But didn't they clear the raid a week after release with zero wipes and a lot of sub-60 people? How is losing that buff crippling? I mean even if they lose a lot of relative power, I don't see how this would be "crippling", they could probably do it with their eyes closed at this point.
---
If I'm in a hurry to go to the northern part of the continent I will use the tram, if not then I'll fly.
---
Nothing. But in this case it helps them not be behind when other Guilds are actively camping them and preventing them to raid. And with a guild that has the mentality to win the "world first classic wow raid" race. Those things are expected.
---
You’re making me feel feelings...
---
Honestly I'd recommend skinning over mining - mining is very inconsistent as far as making money goes, so if you're not just trying to feed materials to a crafter character you're better off with the consistent money of skinning.
---
If you're determined to do mining + herbalism though, you could always make a castsequence macro for Track Herbs / Find Minerals, and spam it as you run around, but that could be pretty annoying.
---
Funny story. 
---
Back when I was like 12 I played an RPG called baldurs gate. When I started playing online with some random guy he kept saying "brb". Little me not know it was short for be right back thought he was roleplaying his character burping.
---
Man you are in the wrong place for comments like this friend. This is the WoW purest "Ur KiLlInG My GaMe" anti-AOE circle jerk meeting, didn't you get the memo?
---
An excellent and very fun spec to play, but it is somewhat weaker in wow classic than in TBC and you need lots of spelldamage gear to really make it work well. Oh and you'll need engineering and the right trinkets (six demon bag comes to mind) since you'll be dependant on gadgets and tricks other classes might not necesarrily require to be competitive. 
---
You have burst in the form of stun, command judgement and a forced holy shock crit which you can use to quickly delete an opponent if you time it well, however it's once per 30 seconds :/
---
You are very hard to kill when played right especially vs melee, 2 shields you can pop within 1 minute of each other is powerful, lay on hands can be another I win button if you are oom but need a last second full heal.
---
As a support spec playing together with another character though you are probably one of the best classes to team up with imo.
---
Because &lt;APES&gt; like padding meters and speedrunning content. +10 % spell crit from Ony buff is ridiculous.
---
the tip is all it's needed.
---
hard to tell. im guessing ElvUi, Sexymap (dunno what it gives) and maybe option in MoveAnything affects minimap.
---
I dont really have a girlfriend
---
I disnt wanted vanilla, neither liked bfa. for me the best part was Bc, wotlk and panda. but at Bc i played so much that its not possible anymore. wotlk and panda were my favourite, because I could still achieve everything ingame as well as doing school or having a serious job.
---
for the first week i played bfa, emissary, wb, m+ on several char, and played classic only after. (or not at all). then I started to lose all interest in bfa, and now doing only classic. 
---
for me it became better than expected
---
Never too low. Never. He knew the risks.
---
It's not about the buff, it's about sending a message.
---
I'm a level 46 priest with about 7 days played. I play about 4-5 hours/day (longer on weekends). I look stuff up, but I didn't plan my leveling and I don't have a quest addon.

I'm not the most efficient player but I'm usually not wasting too much time either.

Not cool. You are fine to be suspicious, but then just ignore the post.
---
huh. I see :O
---
Yeah, for sure. It's not like this will happen again each week. Too bad they'll not have it anymore.
---
So far everyone's been wrong. I'm the only one who is RIGHT.
---
Many guides were made for P servers where XP values for mobs and quests are wrong(Like all of you). 
---
This can lead to falling behind in terms of levels and having to grind levels to catch up to the guide again.
---
I've had a look at a few levelling guide for Classic and one of the most accurate I've found is Hakurai's video guide on youtube.
---
It takes into account keeping cooking up to date as you level and has minimal grinding.
---
so if i put /cast !Auto shot  it wont stop auto shooting if i press the button again?
---
ITT: DPS who doesn't know how to use Focus blaming it on the tank.
---
fair point.
---
305 Skill gives you a 7% hit cap for yellow attacks, not 9%. But with how important your white damage is as a rogue, and how you can get crit capped (again, on white damage), hit is still extremely important to you.
---
Lol if you think a guild like this doesn't already have all their Pre-raid BoEs a month in

Meanwhile the ["fruit" shop](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/c/c9/Stranglethorn_Imported_Fruits.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101004232638) in og...
---
Well done, I should get back to Mulgore soon, nice folk and fantastic nature :o
---
get ready for a speedrun, these guys cleared MC on private servers in like 30 mins
---
so?
---
No one says for the alliance.
---
My warrior tank is running around with felstriker making rogues cry.
---
Apes raid two mc groups, so it’s 80 people, 40 in raid 1 and 40 in raid 2
---
I wish I could remember his name.
---
I started playing World of Warcraft around 2009, but didn't get serious about the game until late 2010 after a certain player helped me out. I had gotten interested during BC but didn't even make it to max level until after the ICC patch had gone live.
---
One day in Dalaran a draenei paladin asked if I wanted to join a raid. I had never raided anything but my fridge before then. That fateful night we journeyed to the Argent Tournament and he taught me about stats, specs, rotation, gear, and more. I hardly knew what I was doing, but he talked me through the raid and even bid for loot that he simply gave to me because it was best in class for my character. I ended up joining his guild and focused on improving my abilities as player due to his kindness.
---
A year later and I was top melee dps in my guild. I set my schedule around being available for raids and world events. I leveled multiple alts to get the benefits of other professions; however, my friend had come from EVE online and wanted more, so he transferred to another realm. Soon after Cataclysm launched the guild I had grown to love slowly began to fall apart.
---
Things were never the same after that. With my mentor gone and my online family vanishing WoW started to feel like a chore rather than an adventure. People stopped logging in, and raids stopped getting progressed as my friends lost interest and prioritized real life over the fate of Azeroth. But even as I quit and resubbed multiple times I will never forget the paladin that unlocked a whole new world. That night changed the trajectory of my life, and I will never forget the experiences I've had in this wonderful world.
---
Meanwhile here I am using my strider pet at level 40.
---
most of them - manualy changed in option of ElvUi addon:)
---
no u
---
 Some People level fast some slow. 
---
Unlike most of the people on Reddit I can't stand leveling and if I had the option to instantly b60 I would take it in a heartbeat so I choose to level the fastest way possible I've done this content 15 times over the past 10 years and don't need to do it again. Everybody has their own style though get to 60 at your own pace
---
Hunters in classic are people who actually enjoy everything the class has to offer. Hunters in vanilla were mostly children who thought the class was cool.
---
Mages, coincidentally, are also a class played because people think they're good/cool. Not hard to see the parallels there.
---
What spell do you use ?
---
*you
---
Better world PVP than everything Blizzard tried after they decided to focus balancing etc on arena...
---
lol. i saw such guy today :D he wiped us btw.
---
I think you missed my point, numbers mean nothing if one side is immune to damage.
---
Wasn't really hating on APES either, they have proven how good they are, just making sure people are aware that a 10second one time use immunity is a big deal and won them this fight. Something they will never be able to use again.
---
Something to consider is that light of Elune was used, this is a 1 time thing which can never be used again to be completely immune to damage for a period of time.
---
None the less amazing coordination, I wonder what they'll do next!
---
Alternative:

Fuuuck, i just saw the alliance and rogue icon and assumed its the same person.

In germany we say: "EHRENMANN"

Thanks, I've been having heaps of fun not having a guide and just running all over the place.
---
hah :D
---
Mine had major problems operating the camera and walking at the same time :D
---
I need to get better at my mage. I’m level 26 and it’s been sloooooooow, not sure if I’m just leveling in the wrong zones or what the real issue is for levelling taking me so long.
---
Get that noob shit out of here. You want to be in this dungeon forever?

10 seconds with a tick every 2 seconds is 5 ticks. 5 ticks a 100-500 is 500-2500. We are saying the same thing, I just added up the numbers for simplicitys sake.   
---
I am curious however, in which situation do you use the skull?
---
No, they're saying the classic model is better.
---
Just remember to pop shadowform after the run, when they have complimented you for your good healing :D
---
ty for vid,will check at home :O
---
Been waiting for another good one! Glad I don't have to wait long. Great stuff man
---
Is there a backport of Legion/BFA UI? Specifically nameplates and action bars?
---
On my server you could usually get a feel for the Curve based on what looking for group was mainly doing. A couple weeks ago it was nothing but ZF last week was BRD and now everybody is spamming LBRS and Scholo
---
Think this is almost the sweet spot as far as the amount of people is concerned, before the servers just buckle under the pressure.
---
Hilarious video though, enjoyed it a lot. Surprised they used Light of Elune this early into the server's life, since you can only have one of those puppies (making you immune to all damage for 10 seconds) per character.
---
Highlights: 
---
* Them pushing into BRM.
---
* Moo dying, cause he fell off the chain like a muppet.
---
* And Rikh just being super fucking happy to be alive and part of this all giddy and excited &lt;3
---
Because we now all know your email address.
---
its 1/10,000 odds to get 2 100s back to back
---
Roughly how long did it take you? I'm new to Wow and just hit 23.
---
effectively, +dmg and +int might be the same, observed over a long period. in a shorter period, like killing single mobs, +dmg takes over significantly. you dont need all that mana, you can drink every 2 mobs. but if you need 2 bolts instead of 4 you will be safer and faster. you dont need full mana every time you need to kill mobs, sometimes its just 1 or 2. you dont need much stamina at all, because the mob is dead before it reaches you. no one on your level can gank you, because the dmg you do is unreal. 
---
overall, +dmg is miles ahead of int imo. but to be fair, most pieces with +dmg also got some +int on it, making it a clear winner in every scenario
---
It's an impossible question to give an informed answer to; it's merely guesswork and nothing else. Hence the snarky replies you are getting - opinions (guesses) on this are worthless. That said, my guess is 2-4 months after Classic release, based on that I like those numbers.
---
\~2 days for level 30 would be "good" for a new player, but who cares. Achieving 90 gold for your first mount directly on 40 is a better goal than a low /played in my opinion.
---
I am not speed leveling in any way, I am just asking because I would like to not be so behind the crowd that by the time I hit 60 everyone has full t2.
---
You can literally see in the video - so that the whole raid can move faster after wbuffs.
---
They are not a PvE guild. And even if they were, they are playing on a PvP realm where it would matter a lot anyway. Did you not watch the video?
---
Why are you so upset about the requirements of a guild that you will never be a part of? Epic mount is really important and so easy to get.
---
My server at Peak time usually has less than 50 60s online. High pop server to during the day there could be 20 to 30 on my faction and there's supposedly 4,000 players total give or take
---
IE6 was released in 2001. In 2006 we already had IE7.
---
Nah its double from mobs
---
all have they own way. dude. how is this cluttered ? unintuitive ? maybe for you. when user sets up UI he knows what he wants. wack ? thats you opinion. Like i dont really like this UI but i like thats its pretty clean and same color scheme.
---
yeah, I call bullshit on that.
---
No im on Shazz, EU
---
Not really a problem, since Tauren also have warriors, the warrior trainer will give you the level 10 warrior quest no problemo.
---
Ill take my chances, im just wondering if I lose out on anything
---
Oh damn, that's pretty hillarious! 
---
You should probably notice a powerspike after replacing your abilities with the higher ranks or macros as the one posted below, however.
---
The problem is Gnomes have made their own reputation, and usually....they live up to it.
---
there's an addon that changes the color on horde side to the darker blue that we all know from retail.  
---
I absolutely despise this pala color while playing ..
---
Play what you want. Raids are a joke. A competent player with a garbage spec and garbage gear will be far more valuable than a garbage player with an optimal spec and optimal gear.  
---
The biggest issue with raiding is finding 39 other people with a pulse and three brain cells between them. If you have a pulse and can follow simple instructions, you'll have a place in a raid.
---
Dropping Living Bomb in the middle of your raid has nothing to do with your spec or class.
---
But not everyone had the epic mount and they all stayed as a pack.
---
I usually run Scholo with a lock from my guild. First few times we usually just sacrificed the tank to pull the entire skeleton room and kite/aoe it down. Then we remembered that Eye of Killrogg also works in dungeons other than SM, and no tanks have been sacrificed since then
---
its easy,u go to https://www.tukui.org/download.php?ui=elvui  , download it and extract intol game folder&gt; classic&gt;interface&gt;adddons (or something like this). Thats all. 
---
:O
---
No you are good dude.
---
I have 10 days /played on my 48 druid. So you are good :D
---
Just enjoy everything and prepare for your mock exams. That will prepare you for the proper exams already and you can chill a bit more when it Comes to them :)
---
God.. Mock exams just brings back memories... Was a good time in the UK :) Have only been there for my A-Levels
---
Emphasis on the middle syllable for me, i.e tan ARE iss.
---
Does anyonr else ever feel guilty benching their other pets, I sure do :(
---
I'll message him so he does see this.
---
oh i see!
---
How many Gnomes does it take to paint a wall in red?
---
Depends on how hard to throw them
---
Entertainment and pornography is a part of the internet. It's also a part of life. Of course you don't want your kids to look at porn and get misinformation about how sex works and all that. But doing this will not shield them, it will hurt them. The internet is also a large library in which all information man had ever found/created, and will create, is. To deny kids access to that because of entertainment or porn is just bizarre.
---
It's everybody from retail wow coming to classic wow who either didn't know how to play beforehand and got really lucky (or blizzard made it that easy) OR new players.
---
I healed every dungeon as full shadow in Vanilla and TBC.  Just say you're holy. They can't tell unless you pop mindflay or something.
---
Yeah I think if you had the close tram departing as you stepped up so you had to wait for the far tram and then took that down you'd get close to the duration of the flight. Can't imagine it's ever slower.
---
If you don't have much time to play and raid you won't be playing anything other than MC/BWL and maybe some ZG/AQ20 with PUGs. 
---
That puts you at the mercy of PUG life where usualy people don't want to bring anything else than cookie cutter builds for every class.
---
On top of that you'll be hard pressed to get any gear unless you get extremely lucky because rogues will take everything from you if you go cat and you can only dream about cloth loot with all the casters competing for it.
---
Your opinion on WPVP isn't really unpopular imo. It's acknowledged pretty widely that classic is not balanced what so ever. My friend bitched about this the entire time we were questing in STV. It's the reason the classes were fixed in later versions. The thing about there being no honour is that's how the game was during Vanilla. Before BGs the only way to PVP was WPVP. People literally grouped up to go raid the Barrens or to run around killing people, even if they were just questing. It truly is the classic experience. I personally like it, as it's much more believable in the way the game was originally set up as a "horde vs alliance" video game. I agree with pretty much every other opinion though, layering has been great, unfortunately it was abused by some people and respecs should be free because as a feral druid, it would be nice to be able to respec into resto instead instead of spamming trade chat for an hour trying to find a healer for a dungeon.
---
Haha yea sorry about that :D
---
&gt; World bosses aren't phase 1 or phase 2.
---
You put forth a question that wasn't presented giving much context, hence I gave you a general answer to the question. 
---
&gt; They moved as a pack at basically the same mount speed. Epics slightly faster in the front, but otherwise all the same.
---
Try riding your normal mount from Kargath to BRM and then compare it to the time it takes with an epic mount. There is a difference. It also helps save a bit of time on their world buffs since they likely won't have the luxury of summoning people (with this video giving a good example of why that is).
---
Well you CAN.....but you're gonna have to make the trek through the Barrens, and there ARE mobs there with ranged attacks, even if you take the road (look at thunder lizards here).
---
How is reserving an item immoral?
---
This is why my auctioneer is a mage.
---
Whoch is reasonable even if you only play like 4 or 5 on work days if on the weekends on you play like 15
---
On behalf of Ironforge, keep your feet on the ground!!
---
Nah, don't even sweat it my dude!
---
They should rework meme specs to make them viable
---
I generally won't even bother trying to auction greens unless they're a significant chunk higher than vendor (e.g. vendors for 15s and AH has them for 50s+) and even with that I generally only try once and if it doesn't sell then I just vendor.
---
That's great man.  Share the luck with me!
---
Laughs in Alliance
---
Or, once you have gear, blast max rank cos paladin healing is the ez win healer, lots of fun in PvP though
---
Been a fun ride as a shaman. While WF crits can easily carry me I never really had to do much PvP on my shaman in WotLK. So there are a lot of things I forget to do. Things like remembering to actually use grounding totem. 
---
I was too comfortable in my safety blanket that was the holy pally to ever learn enhance PvP. (I did a fair bit of ele PvP but that's different since I could typically burst down anything without effort.)
---
what the point of using dps skills as a healer T_T strange people
---
To be fair, content is already on farm.
---
People underestimate how the biggest difficulty of a raid is finding 40 people properly geared and with the time+the will to do the raid. When current raids can be cleaned by 24 pugs, a 40-man raid won't have any problem to take a moonkin with them.
---
Also, the problem of the moonkin is being super mana hungry, not his damage (who are more than good enough). But raids can be cleaned to fast now that it isn't as big as a problem as before.
---
Also, you still bring a +3% spell crit and other buffs.
---
Yea i wanted to play same race and class i played back in 2006 and im still having alot of fun, im not dissapointed. Cant wait for pvp !
---
Basic raidleading for any top guild*
---
My favorite is Scooby Doo cleave just because the name is so creative
---
Looks like the guy is actually secretly getting off to it and is projecting it onto everyone that doesn't like the change!
---
I like cross realm bgs. only change they should keep
---
Its always worth it to restart! Sometimes, if you restart and get to say, 20, you start appreciating things with your original character you did not see before and you can go back to it and enjoy it!
---
Oh damn. So it's better than BfA?
---
Spy?
---
I've reserved a couple items. One of which was manual crowd pummeler. But yeah you just need to be up front with people. (And be in high demand lol)
---
With enchanting, you won't make much until 300, because people tend to not enchating things while leveling any more.
---
That's what I ended up doing too.  Very peculiar.
---
Sadly, definitely not in classic.
---
Anytime you take a shortcut in an instance
---
no.
---
I miss the dungeon finder when I play Classic and I get to the point when I've got a dungeon I could run for more EXP.
---
I mean, I get why it's not there and I don't think it should be added, but I miss it anyway. I enjoy the convenience.
---
Are you using an auction mod? Also, try under cutting the price for a loss...as well, if the cost to AH the item is more than vendor, then vendor the item.
---
Thanks so much! Im going to get the addon. I appreciate you helping me out!
---
It all starts with one kill. We were minding our own business killing Yetis couple days ago, just questing without touching each other, Alliance 60 rogue came for some ez kills, 15 min after 10 lvl 60 from the came guild came and cleared all alliance in the area.
---
That's not a solution because the problem is now and the server really can't wait that long. But It really seems like blizzard is droppin the ball on it. That's why I'm transferring.
---
Congrats.
---
Nice! Now let's slay some horde!
---
lol retail
---
Yes you can do it, only downside of this is the long walk.
---
PvP racials. Most are gnomes and dwarves, yes. Small size is a big plus too.
---
Imagine if every capital city has portals to every other city and you never have to go more than 2-4 places anyway. Retail literally only has the current patch as content + dumb mini games (like literal Warcraft Pokémon) and daily grinds.
---
Gehennas - EU
---
I just dinged 40 on my priest and Ive leveled in holy/shadow hybrid because I want to be a healer. I realise now that I should have just gone shadow. Now i am being told to both respec and to not respec shadow for shadowform, then and respec holy in higher levels.
---
I have no idea what to do. On the one side Ive been told that 45+ dungeons will he hard to heal in shadow, but Ive also been told that healing in shadow is easy all the way up to around lvl 55.
---
Anyone have some ideas for me?
---
You don't really need Resto talents to heal 5mans while levelling. Just keep a few pieces of caster gear as you go, keep the spells levelled and bring plenty of water.
---
Distract
---
The lowest level mob in Maradon is level 42, which means you should be able to get experience from it at level 50. Holding off on levelling and questing because you want to grab some exp from a dungeon is kind of dumb. You still have 3 more levels to go before you out-level the weakest enemy in the zone. You have 9 more levels until you outlevel most of the zone.
---
If you're Horde, you should do all the Jintha'alor quests (all the elite quests). You should really just run Maradon first, as there are a lot of quests there, and a few good drops.
---
I see, can you please recommend where/what wand to get a for shadow priest 50+? I'm a bit new to this game. 
---
Is farming maraudon for this wand worth it https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17745/noxious-shooter ? Or there is something better/easier?
---
So it was changed in 2008.
---
But it is in Classic, do you think it's a mistake they made? Or that they deliberately kept her 2008 look?
---
Very nice, congrats. 
---
feel you, finally ive got my epic tiger as human yesterday
---
I vendor nearly all greens besides bs stated ones like 21 frost dmg or 34 attack power kinda ones people eat that shit up but i think most people have been grind dungs at some stage and have fairly nice gear ftom them
---
nice
---
This truly shows we live in a society
---
Me and my gf transferred to Dragonfang from Dreadmist as well. Alliance side. Did not regret it. We can actually quest in peace, and farm mats. You dont see 1000 players fighting each other for a quest mobs that drop your quest item with 25% chance, while you need 20. Auction house is smaller, but so far we were able to sell everything we farmed. We were able to find groups for whatever instance or quest we were planning to do. The server is still young, so you dont see that many 60s around just yet, but it is getting there. Perfect for people who had enough of the Golemagg elitism, or for late comers.
---
How is respeccing in retail (I haven't played retail in years)?
---
I honestly do kind of wish respeccing was free. I know it's 1 gold the FIRST time you respecc, but more expensive the next and so on. As a rogue it's not the worst thing in the world as all three trees are DPS anyway (although for dungeons I'd like to switch talents), but I do have a druid and realized I don't really want to tank and would rather have a balance druid, but won't respecc until either 60 or AT LEAST until I can get moonkin form.
---
"Healer LFG Stockades"
---
"I'm a healer INV! :D"
---
/sigh
---
Planning ahead for shaman at 60. Is it possible to pvp and pve in the same spec? That 30/0/21 pvp spec looks great. How far will that take me in pve? Can I do ubrs? What about ony and mc? Healing preferably
---
Because they were forced to due to not everyone having an epic mount. Effectively slowing ~35 people by 20/40%. Imagine that, in effect having you in the raid is a 20/40% slow debuff on the raid out in the world at all times.
---
1000g is like ~15-20 hrs of grinding so I think it's obvious why it's required.
---
its benedick cumberbatch!
---
"my nodes" ok dude
---
I'd like dungron finder to set up party but you have to get there on your own
---
lies /s
---
I would love some qol changes like.
---
- reduce respeccing costs. ( kind of on the edge for this one but respeccing is really fun and for most classes raid and solo speccing can be really different)
---
- add a guild bank instead of the gm using lv 1 toons
---
- in game calendar for raid signups
---
Looking for experienced rogue advice. Looking to level up as an alt but unsure what spec to go into. I heard combat is the way to go for leveling but is boring compared to sub? I also want to be useful in a PvP situation, while still being decent at PvE. I'm leveling this alt up with a friend if that matters. Any advice?
---
Some do but get immediately killed by Gul'dan after
---
The salute at the end really was the cherry on top
---
I guess some of us just learned patience.
---
 Not everyone can keep their hearthstone off cool down just for the odd chance of finding a group, even if they did set it to Kargath. 
---
And yes, I know what you're implying. It would be nice if everyone changed their play style to accommodate me. 
---
But I played in vanilla, where you would expect to spend half an evening just finding or forming a group for one dungeon run. 
---
There's a reason people still joke about the person who actually formed a 40man raid as being like until God. Because in vanilla there was no universal LFG channel. You had to sit in a Capitol City doing nothing, spamming the trade chat for hours on end trying to be seen between all the gold sellers. When you would rather be out farming raid mats like everyone else in the group. You had to check people's levels, their spec &amp; maybe even their gear. You had to balance how much 'meta' you had vs how many off-spec were in the raid/group.          
---
Only to have the whole group fall apart because all the tanks &amp; healers were saving their lock-outs for trying to get into a raiding guild's run. The DPS needs out because they need to finish a quest &amp; they can't while in a raid. So starts a chain reaction and now your entire night has been for nothing.          
---
And the one person who did go to the instance portal will never group with you again because he wasted a whole night just sitting there with his thumb up his ass when he could have been farming like everyone else. 
---
If the group is forming up timely &amp; the party lead says they'll soon have the last spots filled, I'm moving. 
---
If not, I'll work my way in that direction but I'm not committing until the group commits. 
---
And I extend the same freedoms to anyone I invite to my groups. I talk to my people. I don't assume they'll follow rules in my head. 
---
If you come to Atiesh I'll be happy to show you a better time.
---
Not quite.  
---
If you're EU then Mograine, Ashbringer and Zandalar Tribe are pvp servers that are popular and either balanced or even with a slight alliance bias.
---
About Layering - I mostly don't even recognize it's actually there. Every zone I visit feels pretty well populated
---
I had a mage poly me after a fight I had with a mob.  I was fuckin pissed, until I realized he wasn't charging a frost bolt.  I quickly yelled to a group of Horde running over that he was Poly Healing me.  I was appreciative, but man the PTSD from mages is real lmao
---
The vast majority of players hate multiboxing but since Blizzard is making some fat stacks off of those people who have a dozen active subscriptions at once, nothing will ever be done about it unfortunately. We have just gotten used to it at this point and accepted it as a terrible part of the game, because there's really nothing else we can do.
---
It depends on the stats. If it's +agi +stam leather or +int +stam or +frost dmg cloth and etc. than you can try to sell it on AH
---
Tbh it's just tower defence but instead of building more towers you control heroes.
---
Also the name of a phenomenal anime.
---
Hard to compete with the most organized guild in the world.
---
Weren't they hated on private servers? All the comments I saw about them before they cleared MC first was "Good guild, but they're fucking assholes"
---
If it’s like a hunter quest, they’ll tell you to go back to your motherland
---
that font doesnt look good at all, buddy
---
I don't think current pve content is hard enough that you need to respec. Keeping your healing pvp spec.
---
Because easter eggs are fun?!
---
Because we play this game for fun?!
---
Because it's a weird thing to have changed?!
---
Why do you hate that other people care about these things? If you don't care about it just leave it right?
---
We care so we're voicing our opinion.
---
I know #NOCHANGES, but I wish there was better access to this city.  It's a shame to see it so empty all of the time with so few(almost zero) reasons to visit.  It's beautiful and the designers did a great job.
---
Also you could probably run into a dungeon if there's one nearby (I haven't seen the video cause it doesn't function on my work PC, so I don't have context).
---
Because sex bad m'kay?
---
No, seriously; that's literally the reason, sadly.
---
I mean, not really. You cant expect everyone to be ready to go soon as they join a group. if it takes 30+ minutes for that guy to get to the dungeon, then it takes that long. As long as its not dicking around on the auction house or still doing quests and is actually making the effort to travel to the dungeon, then be a little patient. If you dont have that much patience, go play retail where it insta-transports everyone into the dungeon.
---
I condom the tank and I condom-wrapper as healer myself.
---
Playing at times when the sun is setting and rising can give some amazing screenshots in different areas :)
---
Okay cool.
---
This is low...
---
Moo streams on twitch
---
My decision to wait for 48 was because people keep telling me I should try and be 48 before I run Maraudon, it wasn't anything to do with exp. I just want to run it for drops and to do it because I haven't done it before.
---
Seems like a fair duel, rather than gank.
---
Ganking is killing others with unfair advantage. This rogue was so kind he didn't even use crippling poison or kick.
---
Respecs basically aren't a thing on retail anymore. Talents are dramatically reduced (you get a choice of three different ones every 15 or so levels) and you can change them at any time as long as you're in a resting zone.
---
No, now it's just laziness.
---
you have to handle your ammunitions, you have mana (so you need to take care of your mana consuption and can't spam your attacks), you need to take care and feed your pets and tame a lot of different pets across the worlds to learn passive and active skills than you can then teach to your other pets.
---
yea, looks like you are right, its 100% more
---
It's a bit too vague. 
---
You're dps, do you want to heal?
---
You're distance, do you want to play melee?
---
You're tissue, do you want to play something tougher?
---
The answers will come once you ask yourself the good questions.
---
It is not, OP is massively exaggerating.
---
Use the none icon and just charge in....unless you a little bitch.
---
To be honest I only played retail for a few hours as I specifically came back for classic. But if I remember correctly respecing in retail is free, you just have to be in a city. Because your abilities are tied to your level, not a talent tree, there are no class trainers.  You don't have to buy them, you just unlock them based on your spec.
---
Star is a healer in dungeon runs because that fucking hunter keeps pulling agro with multishot.
---
I have yet to encounter a "2H tank" who can actually keep aggro on anything.
---
I will laser every fucking one of you!
---
That's beautiful. If he is seeing you, he must be happy to have such a good friend.
---
Awesome! :) I'd like to get one myself.
---
... or is this the part where we condemn sexy things?
---
Horde guilds such as Dreamstate, eHEROES and GRIND aren’t bad, the alliance guilds are just better
---
They even gave them a spell called Blizzard. Pure favortism right there.
---
&gt;Yeah the Healer/Warlock relationship is a bit of a tricky one, healers want everyone basically at 100% hp all the time, while Warlocks have no trouble life tapping down to 1% hp and life draining their way back.
---
I can only speak for myself, but this is at least not the case for me. If I have extra mana I throw out a downranked heal, but otherwise expect the warlocks to fend for themselves. Topping them up is not a thing unless they draw aggro. If they're tapping when watching me keep up the group with 20% mana left and then just stand there looking at me while I drink I'll just ignore them from them on, as they might as well eat mage food, bandage or drink in the meantime. 
---
Another interesting issue though; someone earlier mentioned "aggro from lifetapping" which is a weird phrase in itself, but at the current moment my Grid2 (unit frame) addon does this funny thing. When/if a warlock lifetaps very aggressively, the Grid interface highlights the warlock unit frame as if he would have aggro (for non-Grid users, when someone has/gets aggro they get a red frame around their UF) even though he's not in combat. For the most part, that's completely fine as I can clearly see him next to me tapping away, but in chaotic or confused fights with lots of adds it can be very frustrating since I either make a choice to assume he's just tapping and doesn't have aggro, or throw out an expensive emergency heal to hopefully heal him up so whatever's gunning for him doesn't reach and kill him before I get the heal off. If I choose to assume he's lifetapping and doesn't actually have aggro he might die if I don't pop him a quick heal, though, which obviously sucks. I'm not sure if anyone recognizes this issue, but if you've ran into it and know how to fix it, I'd appreciate some advice. I'm thinking it's linked to dropping under a certain HP threshold in a certain amount of time, but not sure. I've used Grid for ages and it's by far my favorite unit frame addon for healing, so I'm not really willing to swap it out for something else now that I found a Classic-compatible version.
---
Honestly, and I know my opinion isn't in the majority, I agree.  Gold comes and goes, but things like this are rare to see and rarer to have.  The game is about the experience, and I get enjoyment in experiencing cool things.  For me, I would definitely keep it.    
---
I had a party member with an emerald whelping in ZF the other night, and I just thought of how cool that was.
---
name one man.
---
How can you be so dense about this.
---
It's fucking obvious why it was changed. It's literally the same pants but just longer. The only reason it could have been changed is because she needed to be covered up more. 
---
And any reason you can think of that doesn't fit with Classic recreation (making the game like it was back then) doesn't work.
---
The area designer can't have said "I always wanted it this way" because that's the point of Classic, that it's not how they wanted it back then, but how we got it back then.
---
Yeah I think they are, the other day I ran full sucked temple with a pub group (2hours btw)
---
We completed the run nothing dropped that anyone needed so literally need wasn’t hit by anyone the entire time, afterwards we get portal to town everyone says good run gg etc.
---
Later and In a completely seperate zone I’m turning in one of the quests and I notice a guy from the temple run and go to type /wave to see I’ve been ignored then see that he also spit on me! Like wtf lol
---
The best kind of sexy.
---
I know people are joking that others are going to blow a fuse at this small change, but it is annoying to see. It sets a precedence. I bet there are also other small changes that many of us havnt noticed that the thought police will want us to put down to the Mandela effect.
---
Not necessarily. Epic mounts will remain the same price going forward, for example. Netting a 300% profit just for being patient while your goals for that cash remain the same will be far more beneficial.
---
Outragous
---
Is this your attempt at "having the last word"? Should have just not said anything.
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
Private servers did a bettee job recrearing classic then blizzars did. There are buggs and changes made that were 100% not part of actual classic.
---
I'm waiting at Nioma for the Nightscape Shoulders pattern. Can I keep the shop window open or do I need to close and open again to reset it?
---
Why would you? The prospect of being WoW's Red Sonja is great.
---
This is good to know, I wasn't aware of this myself even though it's kind of right there if I'd bothered to dig around.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
No dungeon in STV (except ZulGurub in the north I guess), but then you're going to die multiple times on your way out anyway most likely.
---
How do druids fare in world pvp?
---
na still a shitty thing to do
---
What does “none” do?
---
Ya. It's important to learn how to play around the 5-second-rule so you can lean on your spirit stats to regenerate as much mana as possible. The tldr is to group your heals together so you can have 5+ seconds on not spending mana.
---
If you would read, this moron forgot to edit his response to me when he said
---
&gt; No he didnt.
---
You believing him makes you a fucking moron also.
---
I dont like classic one single bit... boring, slow and time consuming
---
Herod doesn't have a set. Do you mean the Scariest set?
---
RIP*
---
Was thinking the same thing, running around blobbusting in Stonemist Castle hallways with the boys from votf
---
I’m level 28 with 8 days played and been loving every moment. Play at your own pace!
---
This.
---
Sure keep the core game just as it was back then, but I don't think it would have been that harsh to have the retail WoW UI and new character models.
---
lol this reminds me off a situation where a guy asked in sos where he can buy water .. I found the guy who sells bleach bought some and traded it to him - guess he didnt realize I was poisoning him because he gave me some silver and hoped on a flight
---
We obviously share
---
If 30 minutes travel time is too much, you might be playing the wrong game.
---
It's not crippling, but these guys are raiding at such a high level that clearing the instance itself isn't gratifying enough. They min-max this stuff, they want to do the fastest boss kills, hit insane dps numbers, etc.
---
That's fun to them (and many others).
---
Why slap the azz when you could slap the **B A S S**
---
What‘s wrong with druids? I tried to tame Lupos the other day when I was already low health. This druid comes by and instead if healing me, he patiently waits until I die from Lupos - to kill him hisself. (Trancendence)
---
To this druid I want to say: „you do not understand the spirit of classic wow - go back to retail!“
---
For me it's usually lock or priest dot. "Oh, sheep broke early, let me just..." \*Corruption\* \*SW:P\* \*CoA\* "ok, I'll tab to see if there's anything else I could sheep... nope, everything's dotted"
---
Typical Horde needing 4x the amount of players and still losing.

Hey, when your dick is small you got to find a way to boost your confidence

---
How did they cheat to 60?
---
Some bug fixes or some "workarounds" to eliminates exploit would be nice (like the sniper goblin in Gadgetzan to kill players who are ganking people from roofs).
---
And I wish my void walker would be a little better at keeping aggro. No joke, Cpt. Blue Cloud is for me just an enslaved ice barrier by now.
---
And one unpopular opinion: druids are for me the most boring class to play and play against. 
---
Looking at the no life level 60 druid who followed me for 30 minutes to not gank but to tag every mob I needed for my quests...
---
On a theoretical level, no content is hard enough to warrant a full PvE Resto spec. Practically, you'll find raids and PUGs that will require you to spec deep Resto just because. Needs a bit of luck to fly under the radar with your 30/0/21 spec.
---
I'd say spirit is king until Lvl 40-ish when spell damage gears become accessible. And with more and more spell damage gears acquired (preferable +shadow damage, but +spell damage in general) and intellect, shadow priests can level pretty fast too: by melting mobs!
---
You will notice the different when you start to be able to kill 4-5 mobs back to back without having to drink (of course with spirit tap and wand specialisation talents). If you're at your last pull before fully depleting your mana,  just Shadow Embrace the mobs so you can regen back your health. Also, invest on the water/drinks appropriate to your level. And, before you start drinking just Renew (skip if your health is not too low), rebuff your Inner Fire+Shadowguard/Touch of Weakness+Fortitude if they're about to expire and enter Shadowform again. 
---
It's actually very fast and easy to level, rinse and repeat the same rhythm till 60.
---
Im hopping on this chain, is it more efficient to use some mana on mobs, then wanding to save and keep going without drinking or should I just spam cast till it dies?
---
That is just a vocal group of people who are getting butthurt when someone is better than them in a video game. I am sure the complains start flooding when p2 hits and everyone on 50 +zones are getting farmed for honor.
---
 This will not be only APES who are getting flamed for beign neckbeards on welfare. People are gonna get upset when a organized group of players are ganging up on solo and lower skilled players, who maybe cant or dont want to invest as much in a video game than others.
---
Read the combat log, it has the answers
---
Hybrids are expected to heal since 2004.  
---
Don't think it's something new from 2019.
---
You're tripping if you really believe servers like lights hope were more authentic. You have to realize they also had their fair share of changes and differences from true vanilla. 
---
What you're actually trying to say is you just liked them better.
---
Every zone that has kill quest it happens at. Barrens, Stone Talon, Ashenvale, Every where in Hillsbrad. Not sure why you think a ranged mob has anything to do with it. 
---
Im telling you what I’ve experienced and a lot of people have the same complaints. So no it’s not bullshit. Calm down sir.
---
No.  It's not.
---
The dismount around silithid hives was 100% in actual classic.
---
Congrats friend, hail the earthmother
---
I cant even sell my Pendulum atm for 500g on my server... im hoping i can hold it and sell it for more later on
---
Gz
---
A Classic classic "whooosh" :-)
---
ye,ik, even installed addon for 5 seconds timer :D but still,often u need to heal tank VERY often...i mean, even in ZF i had to heal him like every 5 sec with strongest (1500) heal somethimes... which means u HAVE TO drink after and other mates are like "we are speedclearing,lul" and they jsut run to next pack :(  sorry,just remembered bad things X)
---
no problems!
---
How do you possibly remember all of that
---
Useless? While you're fighting for a raid spot as Enh/Ele I'll be dropping Mana spring and Mana tide like nobody's business and keeping the raid alive!
---
not gonna lie, i used my vw most of the way leveling up until around the upper 40's where mobs stopped dying from one round of dots+wand.  then i brought out the succy and it was just enough damage.  However the big tradeoff is the ability to sacrifice your vw for that huge shield in OH S#$% moments.
---
You're missing the connecting point on the edge of Azshara.
---
Haha fair deal that ;) I have a familly member who doesn't like Classic/Vanilla too. 
---
Glad you enjoy yourself now :)
---
Once you hit 36 as a dps warrior you get some pretty cool cleave damage. Charge-&gt; bloodrage -&gt; Sweeping Strikes -&gt; Berzerker stance -&gt; whirlwind is a nasty combo.
---
Tailoring and enchanting, my friend. Make your own wand
---
Yea I rerolled to rogue off my 40 paladin cuz I was tired of healing. Having too much fun on the "alt"
---
I disagree. Classic textures means I can run it on my potato at 100fps on max settings.
---
WoW Classic has that kind of good nostalgia where everything is as good as you remember and the bad parts aren't as bad as you remember.
---
The educational material must be so dated on VHS...
---
I'm playing a level 45 Marksman Hunter right now, and I invested 31 points into Marksmanship to get Trueshot Aura. Following the Icy-Veins Guide I invested 5 Points into Improved Aspect of the Hawk. For the next 5 points the guide tells me to put 2 points into improved Revive Pet and 3 into Endurance Training. Is Endurance Training better than Thick Hide? How often will my pet die in raids and BRD? Is improved revive Pet worth it?
---
Sums up every time i played league since i quit in 2014
---
The less used one gets nipple
---
Welp, if you're really bored, try going from IF entrance to SW entrance, the rationale being that you're leaving one zone to quest in another.
---
Although to be honest, if I have that much time on my hands and I'm bored, I'll level an alt instead, no idea how you'd have the patience for all this :p
---
"- but why your heals are so weak?
---
- well, I never told im a trong Holy ;'("  
---
but yeah, i know, but my questions was mostly like "should i be shadow-healer, or without heal spec i will heal weak and make team suffer". Looks like no :O
---
Haha you were wise to start late, less cluttered zones :)
---
Seems many i know irl who try it also are pleasently surprised.
---
You should be perma banned for using that font 😂 holy crap
---
As a healer I set hearth to where I want to run but sometimes groups can't find a healer and accept me when I tell them how far I am away. I think it's a matter of politeness. If a group is all ready and you are across the world tell them first and let them decide. No one is obligated to run with you or wait for you. Sometimes they've been searching 30m and you're the only person online because it's midnight and no one else wants to make a several hour commitment at that time.
---
This is everything I never knew I always wanted.
---
Thats classic lol. Not easy. Did this the day before yesterday ,but luckily i had my bro with me :)
---
As a warrior you're always ready verbalize your sudden surprise.
---
I got to rank 11 back in the day which required me to play 8 hours of daily pvp. I will not be able to get that far this time around, I won't have the time for it. But I feel like rank 9 could be doable. Rank 10 is just the mount anyways, which might not be worth it.
---
I would love the be max rank and have access to those sweet pvp weapons, but the system is made for people that do not have jobs or responsibilities outside of wow, the no life crowds or the streamers (which are even worse than the previous group). It really is a terrible way to set up a reward system in a game, but it is what it is ...
---
It doesn't work the same in PVP as it does vs NPCs so that is barely the case.
---
I mean organisation aside there's no way those horde players have anything even close to the gear of APES. People seem to forget just how important PVE progress is to PVP strength in Vanilla/Classic. Once you're in epics you can feel like a titan in BGs because it's insanely unfair and you can 1v5 people who don't raid without breaking a sweat.
---
Makes PVP feel great if you have the gear, but suck if you don't, which is why PVP got all squished and fairer because the have-nots outnumber the haves.
---
But yeah, at this point APES have cleared every reset and farmed everything else in between raids, they're geared to the nines.
---
WeirdChamp
---
There are a lot of dumb mini games but pet battles are actually a solid mini game. Not that I miss it, but it is a good mini game.
---
I said this several times and will say it again. Tauren are the closest thing to a true good race that WoW has.
---
What about those oversexualized human males and orcs that are totally ripped? They promote unobtainable body and beauty standards and make me feel inadequate. I believe blizzard should nerf their muscle volume by at least 2/3rd cos rn whenever I'm passing a human orc on my undead I feel judged... Things can not stay like this, I'm liberality shaking rn
---
Question, why do you need int buff for feral tanking? I didn't know
---
Are you on Dreadmist EU?
---
Totally agree with this. I also really don't like the way it's effected the economy.
---
Personally I'd skip WC but there's no reason not to do BFD, SFK is a trek but the gear is worth it for a priest and paladins will always be LFG for their class quest there. Above that it's all worth doing at least once for the bundles of quests (specifically Gnomeregan, Uldaman and Maraudon.)
---
Came here to say this
---
You went in without frost armor lol
---
Big Bad Pauldron is good upgrade at level 45 from ZF. Warriors should be getting that.
---
Everyone knows you have to focus the pet first when ganking a hunter.
---
Having to travel to a dungeon far away into zones you haven't been before with only your legs to carry you there is what WoW classic is all about.
---
Are we even sure Ironfoe is good yet? I know it's about the proc rate but...I want it to be good because I, too, are the farming it.
---
Wait, what'd he post? I read the post the first time but probably glanced over the ad part.
---
Hunter can always scatter+trap, drop a flare on top of the rogue, get to range and reopen with an aimed shot+multishot, and kite with concussion.
---
i had a shadowpriest healing my group for the higher stuff too, it really depends on the group setup more than anything.  if you run spell cleave groups, a priest barely needs to heal at all anyway.
---
Did he drop any good loot?
---
This all reads like a bunch of retail players want to continue playing retail.
---
Classic is more or less exactly as the game was  just after release. This sort of stuff is what millions of people had to got through when playing. Changing anything to be more like retail would undermine the 'classic' name of it.
---
Ultimately it's what bought me back to wow after Legion and I love it.
---
Preach!
---
Yeah, that definitely doesn't work anymore, not even with random inputs. I know because I got kicked while actually playing the game. After coming back from making some food I just about managed to click cancel on the auto-logout prompt, and then I ran/jumped around aimlessly in a circle while watching a 10 minute video, and after about 5 minutes I just got instantly disconnected.
---
I've been leveling a warrior and a priest, both are 21/22. I can't decide if I want to keep smashing things like I've been doing the past 15 years, or heal like I've done the last 8 years. But by then end of classic's life I plan to have at least 1 of each class to 60, as i want to do RP stuff specifically for each class. I also want to find a character named Jocks, to be my rival for my Rogue named Nerds. Sorry, for the tangent, I just got off work.
---
Yep and I explain this to every group and they ignore it. DPS warrior from now on lol
---
Similar thing happened in League of Legends. The American servers adopted ‘MIA’, missing in action, to quickly let their team know that someone is likely heading to another lane, whereas Europe began using ‘SS’, short for miSSing.
---
When I saw the topic I though this was one of the glitch shit and was so ready to downvote but then I watched the clip and holy shit this was probably the best post I've seen here so far haha
---
Tbh... yeah, lol - sucks to be an alliance in Kalimdor... thank god I rolled horde.
---
I say thank god... it really isn't a choice - Horde or eternal-corpse-running.
---
I honestly don't know why every alliance player isn't a night elf - wisp form ftw!
---
Your content is shit. Stop saying “fuckin’”. Give up.
---
Packs are hard but I guess that is prob always true. Ill just pop evasion and grind down the second. A third could be blinded I guess but I just vanish most of the time.
---
So then you dont enable new models
---
You need a pocket healer ;p
---
It's definitely we're more experienced in the game and info is alot easier to find. I think the game is pretty perfect as is, I'm just better at it.
---
I don't know man, that seems like a lot of free time for the average age of classic players which I'd assume would be around the mid 30's.
---
Defensive stance gives you bonus threat, you will want to be in it before you shout for extra threat. Demo shout absolutely can and should be used in defensive stance. Starting a pull with the shout applies a 30 second debuff that will help mitigate damage, but most importantly grab initial aggro from all mobs. Small amounts of healing threat from something like renew will pull the mobs right off you and send them towards the healer, making the pull a sloppy mess. While its true that it is not rage/threat efficient under 4 targets, the aoe threat will make or break the first couple of seconds of the pull, giving you time to tab sunder. As far as the “free” demo shout, I was referring to the rage you gain from specing into Tactical mastery and using the 15 rage gained from the charge and putting it straight into demo shout, which only costs 10. A must better tactic than just body pulling or charging in only to lose all rage switching stances.
---
If it becomes apparent the dps don’t listen to you whisper the healer saying if they pull aggro on AoE pulls not to heal them. They will learn and if not and they leave it’s easy to replace a dps.
---
By the time naxx comes out they'll prolly have a bunch of equally geared alts with the pots ready...
---
[Swampwalker Boots] real snake leather
---
“Just try it. It’s not as addictive as they say it is.”
---
SL beats shadow it is insane anti caster, with the right gear you have 120+ shadow resist as SL
---
Actualy, in my oppinion ESO has the worst monetisation possible. Lootboxes, pay2win, classes for money, mounts for money, transmog for money, etc. It is literaly every single microtransaction type possible. Game got gameplay issues, but this... the most horrible thing, is that the game are pretty fun and overall good. But it is killed by this greedy policy of sucking your money.
---
The Horde in general, is a massive joke at this point in retail.
---
So good to be back to classic again. Where no faction is perfect/both sides are at each other with equal hatred and spite. It's how it should be.
---
I’m a shaman :D
---
Ye I agree with this, giving people the option to set new models in graphic settings and if you prefer the old models then just keep that active.
---
Currently level 39. Considering going VW sacrifice drain tanking at 45.
---
I feel like soul link combined with the low health pool of Succubus is a bad combination but I could be wrong.
---
Yeah it's annoying and I am generally not an arse but I might just start doing it. people are so impatient and want the run done in 5 minutes. That is not how classic works but hey my fault for picking Warrior I guess
---
Well I’m currently on Alliance with a Hunter as my main, but that’s just because my friend wanted to play a Paladin. Otherwise I would have had a Shaman as my alt, but now I need to figure out whether I want my alt to play on the same server as my Hunter as Alliance, or on a different server where my cousin plays on as Horde. I’ve always loved the class fantasy of Shamans, and perhaps it’s just all the YouTube PvP videos, but enhancement seems so fun.
---
I use mage armor all the time, ice armor only when rushing thru mobs. When you’re fighting mobs you shouldn’t let anything get in melee range anyway.
---
I only AH Greens that are amazing.
---
There is such a huge supply right now that everything sub-par will just go to the vendor.
---
I.E. I will Keep helmets and shoulder with AGI+Stam or INT+SPR or INT+STAM - as well as necklaces and rings.
---
The rest I usually just vendor right away because there is good Options to craft too...
---
I was a pserver player and I know how wiping raids worked but I’ve never seen it done this well and effectively
---
Triangle is Banish wdym
---
They should have put a login screen with a queue to be authentic :D
---
That's what makes them successful. They aren't this cozy fuzzy social guild with class leaders and role leaders and everyone has their own little corner of control to make them feel important, like many other guilds. They are an army with a leader.
---
Swap to a 2h and start dozing. If they want to pull aggro from being impatient then you might as well just dps.
---
I don't mind waiting some time, but waiting for a rogue in Un'goro to get over here and then having the group fall apart in under 30 minutes because two people left after wiping once is frustrating...
---
And [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPnMFJiOxT4) is what it looks like on private servers. Really sad that classic gets so much server lag in comparison.
---
Looks like some addons let you check - for example Details! Lets you hover over the class icons to see talents.
---
Getting kicked out of any dungeon for your talents is still ridiculous.
---
&gt;Also, sorry for it not being a screenshot ^^'
---
If only there were multiple ways to take flawless captures of the screen with the computer you were on...
---
it totally depends. If you like instances, and can find a group easily, then go for it. The XP is good and you get better level drops which help solo questing. 
---
If you cant get a group, or the instances is well outta the way, then skip it and keep questing.  The issue with lower instances, is that you have to get the FP or do a lot of running to get there. if this doesnt bother you, then go for it. 
---
I skipped BFD/Gnomer/RZK after I had been running WC and the SFK. From there I just quested, then went to SM once I was high enough.  Again I kinda skipped Ulda and RZD, and instead went questing away, and I'm now running ZF till I get to 50.
---
Alliance is not stronger - APES are just extremely good at this game
---
Wait, there's such a thing as permanent Blasted Lands buffs ?
---
I won't want them reworking. I like they way the function and the uniqueness. That said, a little tweaking to bring them more in line wouldn't go amiss.
---
Never got problems with level scaling, I realy enjoyed that update when it came out. What I have problems with is horrible monetisation.
---
It's only a logical fallacy if you have no data to suggest a trend. We have 15 years of data.
---
oops
---
Do you curse or elements ? Also i have way more spell poser at 60.
---
Combat Swords is the #1 PvE dps spec. 20/31/0. If you’re Alliance, go Human for the +weapon skill.
---
For leveling it’s also the most efficient
---
As fun as this undoubtedly was for them, is it really worth going through all that for MC? I joined a semi-guild-run for MC last lockout and we cleared it easily with no world buffs at all.
---
So new warning then: don't stand on that step and charge
---
The only good gnomes are the ones that never crawl out of their caves
---
Thrash Blade in the main or off hand as a rogue?
---
The rank grind in vanilla wasn't really about skill, I mean it helped. But mostly it was the people willing to play battlegrounds for 12 hours a day for a couple of months with a pre-made group.
---
So I wouldn't put too much emphasis on there not being any rank 14 dwarf rogue videos up on youtube. Also keep in mind even if there was a high ranked dwarf rogue he might not have the hardware needed to record anything, or simple not caring about sharing anything in video form.
---
Thank you, I remember using it in MoP but that was quite awhile ago lol.
---
So Cobalt Crusher (lvl 29 TH mace) dropped from SM the other day. I was tempted to sell it for 3g at AH and make some quick gold for my mount at level 40, but it seemed a really good weapon, so I decided to wait. I have been asking in my guild and it seems is a great "twink weapon". Now its going for 5g at AH, and I dont really need gold now as I already bought my mount. As we don't know when "twink weapons" will be a thing in Classic, should I wait and try to sell it in when it gets more expensive?
---
I read this like ”7.5 years of my childhood passed away” - i thought, that sounds resonable. 
---
Sorry for the loss
---
Stop I can only laugh so hard
---
r14 was insane GRIND there is no skill involved
---
Serves him right for naming his character after a shitting disorder. "But I got a 3 letter name d00d!!!!!"
---
Well, didnt watch the sheet as from the explanation you are missing one very important point. This calculation (if correct) is only valid when you are the only healer and doing a 5man instance. 
---
In alliance, all healing is heal sniping in MC. If you cast slow heals, i can guarantee that you will have 50-80% overhealing. Just spam the faster heals to keep people topped or just focus on dispelling.
---
You can absolutely spam max rank flash of light. In big incoming predictable damages (think like onyxia breath etc) just precast max rank holy light to get the tank back up (with sure crit talent activated if possible). After a while, lower ranking flash heal is like pissing in a burning building. It fucking doesnt do anything, rly. Might be great HPM, but when mana is the least of your problems... you want to maximize your HPS, not your HPM as a paladin. After small amount of gear (maybe not yet, but with DM mp5 gear), if you go oom in a bossfight in a raid, your RL should start looking what the dps is doing.
---
Paladins are almost exclusively auto attacking. Just use your abilities, melee, and afk
---
the thing is, when people were originally raiding T1 and T2, blues were all pure stats and very few pieces were better than tier gear.  now that we have the 1.10 spell power blues from dungeons that are better than or equal to epics from MC, you won't be seeing as much t1 on casters but for all the rest of the classes, they should still be decked in tier gear or offset pieces from MC.
---
Now there are two of them!
---
Wooord
---
Westfall then Redridge
---
Mage shits on rogue if played correctly
---
Keep it! 
---
I’m a bit biased because I love collecting pets. Have the hyacinth macaw... oozeling and all whelps now :D
---
Anyone lvled has an arcane? What about arcane in raids?
---
You guys (not just the tanks but like everyone else) need to stop thinking that if the tank doesn't have the aggro of every mob at all time then it's a fail pull. 
---
Repeat after me: This is not true and it's not even possible.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Even if all the dps were hitting on the same target, the healer would grab some aggro. Even the tank most of the time can't hold aggro on a single target if a dps start critting a bit.
---
&amp;nbsp; 
---
When I start aoeing in a non spellcleave group, I don't expect the tank to hold aggro. I have CCs, the other dps have CCs.
---
Even if I'm not aoeing (because let's say it's a harder pack than usual) there's many ways the pull can go wrong and all the dps need to go damage control mode. We know the tank can't taunt everything so I'm probably going to have to take the aggro on me because I can kite, then the other dps are going to help me by taking at least one target each, etc. 
---
Anyway, I'm a bit tired of people thinking if you're not pulling one by one and only focusing the Skull you're doing it wrong. That's what we did when we were all terrible players who didn't know what they were doing.
---
I'm not saying some dps aren't garbage but in the end the way you judge the run is by how long did it take and did we die a lot. If the response is about one hour and we only wiped once or twice then who cares how it was done.
---
Oh and btw, the dps who blame you for not holding aggro on every single mob are probably terrible players. Don't mind them.
---
3g will be easy to make later. BGs will be relatively soon, I'd bank it.
---
I looked it up.
---
Distraction does not initiate combat, so it is not an attack, and therefore not an exploit.
---
Fuck off, this is working as intended.
---
If you get mc on a boat you are either afk or horrible. There's so many ways to avoid it.
---
That still doesnt work
---
In our guild we have 2 "main" tanks who will get a full fire resist set and generally tank on boss fights. Every other warrior (and I mean literally everyone of the 5-10 other warriors in the raid) is expected to have a tank set and be able to pick up adds when needed or switch to a shield in case of emergency.
---
The only difference really is that the main tanks don't bring a DPS set and the DPS warrior don't bring a fire resist set.
---
I'm not entirely sure by your post which of these 2 you would fall into but that is how we handle it.
---
In males? Probably very filthy.
---
Im not sure what you mean? Skipping on the macro?
---
Oh I am. I think it's hilarious at this point. Through my adventures so far, I haven't run into a single mage aoe farming quest spots. Get on here and people act like as soon as you leave town it's nothing but mages aoe farming. I'm on Whitemane too.
---
I'm not claiming you are average. I don't know if it's reasonable, though.
---
About question itself. Rogue racial is what makes them so special. that is probably best alliance side racial ability.
---
I'd wait until Battleground are added at least.  
---
You might see a surge in prices, you may not; but if you don't need the gold there's no harm.
---
I took down 4 hunters one time. Well 3. I gnomish mine controlled 1 and they killed him. Lack of organization is a group killer.
---
I heard so much complaining about that quest while leveling up and didn't really pay any attention to it, and then I got the quest and looted it on my very first kill and thought oh wow cool easy quest. Then I keep playing and hear people talking about it again and realize it was the same quest I completed, and then I realized my luck.
---
Respect! o7
---
I play on a pvp server and thought i try my luck taming echeyakee.. so i prepae at ashenvale, get a pet i could throw 'away' and named it something like "iTameEchey" (but in german). So i went to the location where the horde players can spawn him and a random lvl 20 horde mage shows up. I /wave him, /point at "iTameEchey" and /please him. So he goes and summons Echeyakee and even sheeps him for me &lt;3. I tamed him and named him after the horde player that helped me. (I play on a PVP server) Love the community in classic &lt;3
---
I am playing priest, currently level 46, and just wondering where should I get drinks for mana ? I didnt find any recipes in cooking, are casters supposed to just buy them from vendor ? I wanted to be self-sustanaible.
---
The set is around 400g on Gehennas H
---
Yes, sexy things are evil and sexy women are unrealistic and oppressive, you pig.
---
Oh yeah if you're not desperate, I would just hold onto it.
---
Wow, this is my first time realising that the words in the movie version make little sense...
---
In the books he leads into that part with 'Rock and pool, so nice and cool, So nice for feet!'
---
Sticking juicy sweet at the start there makes no sense?!
---
I guess my brain has always just filled in the blank since the camera kinda cuts away for that line.
---
My 2 hour afk sessions beg to differ.
---
I love these.. I will have to get one some day.
---
The problem is you chose warrior, life is much more fun as a rogue.
---
Have you seen HOTS? All their female are covered in sexy in that game 😅
---
I salute you scribbler
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
If you feel like playing something completely different, go Paladin. Leveling is tough but Holy Paladins are extremely competitive in PvE and PvP. They bring incredibly strong raid buffs, and are notoriously hard to kill in PvP.
---
You forgot the "free frostbolt crit" on the hunter trap :)
---
Afaik, rank 14 does not require the utmost best of skills and racials. Having lots and lots of time, and ideally a solid network of players to do premades with is more important. So I'd say optimal racials matter more in duels and in arena.
---
Outside of the r14 aspect, I played both elf and gnome rogue, and I always envied the horde rogues for their racials. As far as alliance goes, I'd also recommend going dwarf if you can stand how they look.
---
I think being able to remove poisons and bleeds and blinds adds more to the toolkit than an additional snare removal. You already have improved sprint, vanish and potions to remove snares, and can slow your target with poisons and stuns and whatnot. Teammembers can also easily cleanse magic effects. However, there are less options to remove bleeds and poisons which prevent you from staying in stealth during an intense fight.
---
Uhh, sure they would. But there is no way they would raid their first Naxz with anything else than their mains. Some of the gear is just so rare that they won't be able to replicate that on alts
---
Initial threat. It won’t do anything to hold them. But it will stop them from going right to the healer at the start of the pull.
---
when healer goes oom after a big pull, i usually put renew on everyone and heal myself to full. shapeshift is a lot of
---
mana as well.
---
and for instances like zf theres a great aoe for feral tank, soecially for melee mobs at gy: you go in bear, demo roar. then a mage run to you, frost nova. you jump back and everyone start using aoe, you too use hurricane. thats your best aoe. the group goes down insane fast.
---
lol briarwood reed does not exist.  we have killed jed about 8 times now and he only drops a wand and another garbage blue that no one wants.   It's at the point where our casters almost prefer he doesnt spawn so we don't get our hopes up.
---
Not really. SL/SL is pretty much unkillable, and the more enemies he has - the more unkillable he becomes.
---
Both are terrible ideas but if I had to pick one it'd be disc. You get as much credit for healing in pvp as you do for damage.
---
I made sure i did them all, dont mind the time efficiency of travelling far too much. I just loved doing them all again
---
It's not just gear, they walked into BRM with a significant number of Light of Elunes ready (you can hear the raid call for it multiple times). There's not a lot you can do about 80 people running at you with 10 seconds of immunity, let alone if you aren't expecting it.
---
Or even better - 'Breaking me down' by Soil
---
You did dire maul at lvl 17? Impressive
---
You buy them from any Innkeeper.
---
How on earth have you leveled to 46 as a priest without buying drinks !?
---
A thing to bear in mind - as a Warrior you might have a harder time casual raiding since spots for the main tank are sparse and competitive, and if you opt for a dps role then you’ll have to commit time making sure your gear is up to scratch.
---
Priest is definitely the more casual friendly class since raids would be a bit more lenient to take you slightly undergeared, which unfortunately isn’t the case for warriors.
---
Westfall I would argue is almost mandatory for alliance because of the deadmines chain quest
---
i seriously believe they removed the trinket from his loot table.  we have killed him at least 8 times now as a guild and seen 0.
---
Well, to be fair, if it wasnt for LoE they likely wouldn't have been able to make it inside BRM with their entire raid intact. I would be interested in seeing a repeat scenario of the same situation with LoE. Not to say they can't take on superior numbers, but it won't be as much of a faceroll as what happened here.
---
Druid is strong in PvP. They are very versatile. Don’t expect to top dps or healing meters in PvE: they are jack of all trades master of none.
---
No, it's definitely a bowling pin.
---
I think you replied to wrong person
---
Says you. If burning crusade is in, I'm out.
---
They could just make it look normal though
---
Warriors should use str not roll on agility gear..
---
previous run of ZF suddenly i undestood that they are “speedclear party”. Ok, thats fine. Untill we found a chest, and they just rolled it and continued running to next rooms. And i won this goddamn roll! I asked to wait me (im a healer) and they told something like “ignore chest, its useless/weak/not worth anyway”. WTF guys, its a fucking chest! Why are you even play reborned classic if you midleveling already dead inside and not interrsted in random chest gambling loot..=/ sigh.
---
Should I just be vendoring skinned leather in the early levels?
---
Does Sunder Armor actually increase damage at all when used against regular mobs?
---
Try that in anything after sunken temple my dude. Your healers will absolutely hate you.
---
You’ve been playing shaman incorrectly the entire time.
---
70-80% of your damage during a fight should be auto attack. Use all your mana spells first (1-3 totems, a 1 shock) and then regenerate mana during the fight.
---
This is a pretty standard Seal Fate build. You should dual wield though. Only autoattacks are subject to the dual wield miss penalty, not special attacks.
---
If you intend to pvp, Master of Deception is generally more useful than camo because without MoD, you will always lose the opener to a stealthed rogue who does have it.
---
Also note than if you're fighting mobs, you cannot ambush-&gt;backstab in quick succession because they turn around instantly and it takes a global cooldown to get the second attack off. Even in pvp, it's a dangerous opener choice against good players because choosing to maximum burst instead of stunlock puts you in a vulnerable position and gives them a chance to respond.
---
Seal fate dagger builds are pretty mediocre at grinding open world mobs but they offer a stronger baseline in pvp than similar but more cooldown-focused Cold Blood/Prep builds, while also being quite nice for 5man dungeons. however, Seal Fate performs very poorly compared to combat builds in raids until the absolute top tier gear in vanilla.
---
Nothing wrong with good looking women but dude that armour looks ridiculous you have to admit
---
If you didnt have the Desolace flight path it would pretty much be a straight shot
---
" For me, classic has been nothing short of a confirmation that yes, it was a good as i remembered. It really felt like the game i originally fell head over heels in love with, even though it is not a 100% true to vanilla, it is close enough. It just is a super sollid game that feels very close to the Warcraft side of things. "   
---
BINGO
---
Yeah, what I do is wait for anyone to be in the 20-30% health range, use my biggest heal and a renew, and then use my wand until someone is again back down to 20-30%. If the tank is appropriately leveled and not tanking in berserker stance this is usually enough spirit regen that I only need to drink every 3 pulls.
---
Only thing I would change?
---
Area Loot
---
Enemy cast bars as standard
---
B opens all bags. It not just the backpack.
---
That's literally it. Rest of the game is perfect.
---
add
---
/targetlasttarget
---
to the end of your sheep macro - switches back to whatever you were nuking before you sheeped something
---
if you want to get fancy you could do something like
---
/targetlasttarget \[harm, nodead\]
---
to make sure you're not targeting a now-dead mob, or your healer.
---
yeah at 60 everyone wants to invite rogues because its always casters making the groups and rogues don't roll on caster loot LOL.
---
This is one of those ideas that once you see it you are baffled no one ever did it before. Such a great product! I may look into getting one.
---
Well you have a ranged DPS class so my suggestion is to pick up a melee class and a hybrid to mix it up.
---
Perhaps a rogue and shaman/Druid? They’re all strong PvP classes too.
---
Gear from mc isnt that important if 2 whole raids are carrying sapper charges and faps...
---
I’m backstab spec, yesterday my offhand dagger broke in the middle of the dungeon, so I replaced it with skinning knife. My damage didn’t change much.
---
Get into a guild, get to level 30 and get someone nice to help you with your whirlwind axe. Will carry you to 40-45. After that get Rockpounder from Uldaman. 
---
What’s your race?
---
And yeah leveling a Warrior is the hardest out of all classes, but right now they’re #1 tank and #1 dps in PvE.
---
Who would have thought that pserver players will dominate? Maybe not all the people that trashtalked pservers before Classic released and claimed none of the stuff is transferable because private servers had it all wrong and that Method would stomp?
---
I *LIKE* TO *MUNCH* IT *VIGOROUSLY*
---
:( I feel the same way. I abandon every quest that requires me to speak to Thrall. Those pecs and that jaw-line make me feel so inadequate.
---
Yes you should do them, but make sure you get the quests for them and probably only do them once or twice unless you really want the gear. Questing is a much better way to level.
---
Take a closer look at High Inquisitor Whitemane and her dress. And black mageweave jacket+pants..
---
Not even AQ40 or Naxx?
---
Dwarf or gnome imho. Dwarf is better vs rogues and gnome is better vs mages.
---
For the newer players out there, here is some context to this clip that makes it even more impressive:
---
\- One of the Horde guilds in the start of the video appears to be &lt;Dreamstate&gt;, another hardcore private server guild with years of Vanilla experience. They've held speedrun records on pservers and have numerous R14 players and retail WoW Rank 1 players on their roster. This isn't experienced players rolling over Vanilla newbies. 
---
\- The call at 01:53 to not use Goblin Sapper Charges is huge and the reason the rest of the video was able to work. Most other guilds/guild leaders would have called for Sapper Charges when approaching a mass of opposing faction members. The split second foresight to delay the charges and save them for the push into BRM is huge and shows discipline as well as tremendous trust in the guild's mages to AE the enemy down.
---
\- at 03:56, the guild leader (Maitoz) calls for the raid to "bind light". What he is referring to is 'Light of Elune', a unique quest reward that makes the user immune to all damage and spells for 10 seconds. He makes the call for the raid to keybind their Light of Elune at this moment, knowing that without it, the raid would likely be wiped as their rogue spy called out at least 93 Horde in BRM.
---
\- At 4:09, the rogue spy, Perplexity, communicates enemy movement precisely. He does so throughout the entire video, despite hunter flares presumably all around him in the mountain. How he stays undetected like that is nuts tbh.
---
\- At 04:41, Maitoz asks "Are you sure it's 120?", referring to the amount of Horde in BRM. When Perplexity confirms, Maitoz calls for the Light of Elune/Sapper play, which means Light will be used at this moment (again, it is a unique quest reward and Alliance can only get 1 per character). He then says "Nifty", referring to Nifty Stopwatch, a level 40ish quest reward trinket from the Badlands that increases run speed by 40% for 10 seconds. Many people don't know this item even exists or don't understand it's importance in mass World PvP, but it is essential and is often paired up with Free Action Potions to reach an enemies backline as quickly as possible. Good call there.
---
\- At 05:40, Monkeynews and the rest of the raid use their Gnome Racial, Escape Artist, to break out of a huge frost nova that left them exposed. The play itself wasn't too notable, but the nearly raid-wide requirement of being a gnome is. Shows that the guild understands which races to pick for PvP in Classic and demonstrates their knowledge of the game. They almost all break out of that nova instantly.
---
\- At 05:50, Maitoz decides not to go into MC and instead go up the chain. This call is actually brilliant and showcases his experience. Most raid leaders would have taken the jump as a sign of victory and headed inside towards Molten Core, leaving some of their straggler players behind and vulnerable. &lt;APES&gt; does not do this, but instead, Maitoz makes the call to go up the chain, giving the guild the high ground and the capability of a massive flank on enemy Horde would decide to jump down and chase. This is exactly what happens; the Horde jumps down to chase, Maitoz calls for his mages to flank them and jump down in the lava with the Frost Novas, and the Horde dies to lava damage. Actually 200 IQ on that play tbh.
---
\- The fact that they did all of the above with less than 8 deaths in the main raid. Insanely impressive.
---
I'm sure there was more that I missed but god damn if this isn't a beautiful video. A nice crash course into BRM PvP and raid wiping. As a Horde player though, obligatory FUCK THE ALLIANCE for having access to Light of Elune.
---
The only way to get a mount at level 40 is to completely ignore professions. Just quest and literally vendor any item your loot (except for valuable blue or purple items) Also do not train for spells you won’t use or don’t need to level.
---
Depending on your class it might take you til level 45 to get the gold. Some classes are very spell/skill dependent
---
My best friend died May 2011. I was the one who introduced him to wow and we'd play all night long. Playing classic, I think about him everyday.
---
Source???
---
Achievement and the bear mount came in wotlk with the release of achievements
---
hah! thats kinda what i expected with this.
---
Here come all the posts about how you didn’t screenshot.... ugh. Lame people.
---
That's what happens when you play a game that isn't watered down and pandered to the masses. I wish old classics like Ragnarok had some support, early 90-00' games are almost all objectively better than the trash coming out these days.
---
Respect ✊🏽👏🏽👍🏽
---
It's nice one sided fun. I guess those ppl are drunk.
---
+10 million armor.
---
BFD has a good wand iirc. Do whatever tickles your fancy and/or if there's an opportunity but don't feel like you are obliged to do them all.
---
Win-win
---
Yeah lol, must be
---
i mean you cant complain that people are rolling on stuff in a level 50 dungeon that you can easily come back and 2-3man at level 60 without touching a single trash pull.
---
Our progression is literally the same pace. I still use that 1hand from wc too.
---
But what about your next mount!?
---
For 1vs1 PvP as a shadow priest, what should my approach be? 
---
Currently if it’s a melee class I’m up against, I’ll usually fear them, apply shadow word pain, and then spam mind flay to keep them at bay, healing when necessary.
---
For ranged/casters I bubble up, use sw:p, silence and mana steal while hitting them with mind blasts, also healing when necessary.
---
Is this the right approach?
---
Getting rid of bleeds/poisons can be a game changer Vs other rogues or warriors, but that's assuming you remember to use it at the right time. Dwarfs are the best minmax alliance race for pvp rogues.
---
What you’re describing definitely Druid, maybe Rogue. The ability to stealth and get behind enemy lines is a lot of fun.
---
Druid will also be stronger than Rogue in soloing mobs because of their heals, bear form, etc.
---
They are also very strong at running away when you get in trouble.
---
As long as you’re specced Feral you can tank with no problem every dungeon in the game. Just make sure you are a high enough level (around final boss level for that instance minus 2 or 3).
---
Leases... bro, leases. Choices are being made! When you're on a budget, you either do this or that.
---
Its like the others here already said.  
---
Leveling as druid is very comfortable.  
---
The first 20 levels are a bit tough but when you finally have cat form leveling starts to make fun. When you have all your cat abilities you have almost no downtimes. Kill some mobs, shift out for a big heal and shift back to cat. In between your mana should be full. For leveling I would recommend the HOTW/NS spec (first focus to get the feline swiftness). You can tank or heal the dungeons (if you have some int gear). Tanks are very wanted and you will find the dungeon groups very fast.  
---
When you hit lvl 60 there are some more interesting specs. My plan is to respec to Moonfury/NS (30 0 21) spec when I hit lvl 60.  But I need to figure out which fells the best.
---
Lvl 53 shaman who wants to roll a druid tank so bad

---
Why can't blizz just give us good servers? All the private servers ran way better than this. I wanna see high-end, gigantic scale world-pvp look smooth and crisp, that really would be the pinnacle of WoW imo. Tbh I wouldn't even mind if Blizz just decided to improve the top guild/streamer servers (Faerlina, Gehennas etc.)  I'm only on a medium pop realm and probably wouldnt see the benefits of a higher quality server anyway.
---
Thank you very much, when i get enough gold after my mount im gonna respec
---
There's no too slow lvling, there's only a pace that you find fun. However, I would suggest leveling to 60 before p2 drops as after people start getting honor, ganking on pvp realms will explode. This is of course only a concern if u play on a pvp realm
---
Purple is Banish/Fear
---
For solo stuff Thick Hide &gt; Endurance Training.
---
For group stuff Endurance Training &gt; Thick Hide.
---
Since you're leveling I would very much recommend going thick hide.
---
In dungeons your pet should rarely die, in raids however it will die some times, no biggie though, just ress it after the pull and move on.
---
Druid travel form is pretty even with mount speed once you start counting mount cast speed, the fact you can't do it in combat, getting dazed off mount and dismounting in water. Only on long trecks through low level zones is it significantly slower. 
---
When you are questing, skinning(in form) , herbing and killing while you go during the 1-60 grind there are very few instances where a mount is significantly faster.
---
They can stealth, heal and escape many situations, pretty hard to find another class that can be guaranteed to kill them.
---

Yep! Life &gt; WoW

Yes because things would have stabilized in the long term while layering temporarily solved the issue and did long term damage. I'd rather have tons of low/mid levels and a healthy economy than tons of 40-60 levels with ruined economy.

---
There are more trinks but cant remember, lots of engi gadgets and what not.
---
yeah once i get to around that level i swapped over to a succy and leveling got alot easier.  as long as you keep your wand level up to date you shouldnt have a problem leveling.
---
If they want to!
---
It’s wildly exaggerated like almost any stereotype in wows history
---
That was normal in 2004
---
Typically I will flame shock, get a stormstrike in then auto for the last 70%. Heal only when I need to and use frost shock if needed
---
In pve I was thinking of doing an ambush and wait for regen and doing a gouge backstab.
---
I guess I need to get used to slow stealth (its so sloooow!) but that does sound resonable.
---
Thanks for the input!
---
4-6month is soon? :/ don’t think we get it that soon.
---
You miss one lol, would make it way faster if you had gotten az path in the east
---
.
---
Problem is that earthfury has 1/6 the players. Or 1/4 the alliance players as skeram. Personally I would just stay on skeram. Areas can still easily be controlled by working together. Hell I saw one good mage kill like 8 horde before finnaly being driven away from a quest spot the other day.
---
By the time bgs roll around you should be more organized and more skilled than the average horde. And with instant ques to boot.
---
Players got better, but patches clearly made content easier over the course of vanilla's development. Blizzard knew this was going to be a problem on the classic servers because they raised the armor values on mobs after the beta finished. 
---
I don't think no changes was a bad thing to campaign for though. Why would you trust Blizzard with making changes? This isn't the Blizzard of 2004.
---
My hunter is lvl 16 right now and has ~4g. Is this much? I honestly can‘t remember from back in the day
---
What is your question?
---
You could also try Warrior. They are very strong in dungeons and raids. Topping Molten Core and Onyxia DPS right now by a big margin.
---
Mage is great, but can get boring. And I wonder if they’ll able to beat Warriors in PvE DPS.
---
How exactly did they exploit what? And do you have any proof for your statements? Generally curious.
---
why are u so cringe bro?
---
Are you actually doing the boss? From what ive seen its just AoEing the zombies in quick 10-12min runs.
---
Back in the days I had a 60 hunter so I rolled one in classic.
---
Hit 60 last Monday started running a few dungeon for bis gear and.... Well its underwhelming.
---
I run with pug since I'm not in a guild and I feel like most of the time I'm trying to get/stay in position to be able to shoot, get 2-3 shot in and targets dead. Next!
---
So I guess it depend what you want to do. Pet management is minimal it seem, even while leveling. Kitting..... Yeah sometime but rarely while leveling.
---
I think I would have been happier with a mage and would have more money (pet food, ammo etc)
---
tbh when i lvled troll hunter into 30s i was surprised by how unfriendly undead players were. i rerolled dwarf and now close to 50 and find human players to be the most unfriendly and surprisingly dwarf playrs are so friendly never had beef with a dwarf. i quit my first guild because of drama caused by a human rogue...
---
Ambush is only good to one-hit kill drinking clothies (sitting player = guaranteed crit). Garrote breaks your gouge, so use that with care. You'd usually open with cheap shot on most enemies.
---
Have you considered that women (in kuffar countries at least) can voluntarily make the decision to wear hotpants? You sound like one of the lefties who "liberated" F1 pit girls by getting their jobs cancelled and then went on twitter to tell them it's a good thing
---
Hamstring kiting was the meta on private servers I believe. You slow the mob and then weave in and out of melee range just when your weapon swing was about ready, so you'd do full damage but the mobs only got a short window to hit back (and with usually a faster hit rate, would miss out on a few hits).
---
Not sure that even works with leeway.
---
Grats buddy. I'd forgotten just how big of an accomplishment getting that first mount was after all these years. I didn't get mine until 43 :(
---
If you are taking backstab damage/crit talents why not just use them as primary abilities if you are in pve content. I know you cant use them unless you are behind the target and need to use sinister strike, but in dungeons use then instead of using sinister strike
---
This is maybe not a good idea when levelling. Casting an aspect interrupts your mp5, so sometimes you’ll want to hold off on it.
---
Yeah, it's not really worth the bother of using the AH.
---
Yeah, it's a really unerrated skill for early warrior leveling!
---
Yet all that lovely +sp at level 40-50 is going to be quite crap in PvP. Why? Because you'll have no manapool, no basehp - No nothing. You'll lose against all competent priests, warlocks and druids automatically. 
---
Your only hp is going to come from ice barrier which you either have to time perfectly against priests, shamans etc or have it purged.
---
Hard mode is hard
---
It's incredibly easy. The only major difference is .5 second off cast times, and 15% reduced mana costs on heals.
---
when i leveld i always vendored all leather i got pre 40.
---
at 40 i was at about 80g, getting my mount at 41.
---
nowadays i ah everything i get and only vendor when i cant get rid of it after a few days.
---
Only time I use mana during a fight is totem placing, maybe frost shock to prevent them from running away and to reapply lightening shield right before the next pull. I almost never have to drink. The vast majority of your damage is white auto attacks.  
---
I also would rather have a fight take 3-4 seconds longer but have mana to heal after if I really needed to
---
Nah. Retail is crap.
---
People couldn't change hairstyles in vanilla so it has no place in classic at this point either now does it?
---
Mailbox question: In vanilla your unread mail stayed in the mailbox for 30days or so. But your read mail only for 3 days. In classic read mail also stays for 30 days. 
---
Is this a known issue?
---
&gt; at least for PvE.
---
I didn't mention PvE? I specifically wrote "PvP-wise that sounds quite hopelessly useless."
---
What about ore?
---
a priest in my guild literally triggered someone's ptsd by mind visioning them, which made them run off the chain in BRM straight into the lava.  we were so far away we had no clue what he did lol.
---
I don't know what any of that means
---
Google Zul Farrak Mage farming lol.
---
Yeah they're the worldwide alliance heroes.
---
Does someone know why they rolled ally ? Tastes ? Difficulty ? Another thing that I can't suspect ?
---
They aren't, horde are stronger in pvp
---
They are good at avoiding encounters and running away. They are also good at living. They are so good at living in fact, that that's how you kill people, by keeping yourself alive until they die to your bleeds/dots. They lack damage. If you want to go from stealth to killing in 5 seconds, it's better to go rogue.
---
I'm not crying... you .... okay  that teared me up.
---
And as we all know the game got just better with every day he was away from it!
---
Enjoy your cloth and bottle of water.
---
I've healed BRD and LBRS as shadow, absolutely no problem, except for situations where we would've wiped even if I was holy/disc.
---
It adds to the experience.
---
Mindlessly rushing through quests without real threat lurking in the shadows is not fun for me. Watching my back, creating alliances and gang banging is what keeps wow fun. Also the betrayal factor. You can quest alongside the other faction peacefully, then once they are done with their quest it’s game on.
---
 **“you live only as long as the last person who remembers you”**
---
p.s. congrats, Scribler
---
There's a quest reward from feralas called Cairnstone Sliver that is the immediate precursor to noxious shooter, and then at lvl 54 you can get Smokeys Fireshooter . Both are from quests so no farming required, but noxious shooter is usually how one would bring the gap, but after a point its probably better to level to 54 and do the quest.
---
This won't change. You need to find a tactic that works, you need to know which players can survive that extra hit, while you fight for aggro. You need to prioritize which targets to make sure stick to you, because it's unlikely you'll find that group to give you the time you need to build threat. I've found success in making calculated decisions based on threat distribution in aoe pulls. Target prioritization is key here, do you taunt the dude attacking me priest or Mr rogue, etc.
---
This is a battle you'll be in ... With every group. I suggest you find a strategy that works for you.
---
i not 100% sure about pally rotation but your rotation seems appropriate.
---
Yeah it happened to me in a 1v1 vs another hunter and i almost lost cuz of it.  missed like 2 autos in the fight ...
---
Man, Magister's Terrace was THE THING back in TBC. I took pride in being able to tank that shit properly and can't wait to see it back in Classic :)
---
There are very few dungeons to avoid completely, DM as a horde could be one of them.
---
My best suggestion is to gather up all quests, and if there are 5 or more, then do the dungeon for quests and loot. If there is a lot of items for your class then you can do it a few times to get that loot.
---
/spit
---
Those huntadin dwarves i BRD though... Rifle, heals AND bubble.
---
Gehennas has 7k queues at prime hours, so yeah.
---
Not both. A pet gens 5 focus/second. With only screech, the owl will screech once/4 seconds (so full uptime of the demo effect). You could micromanage growl if you want as well, if using a threatmeter. With growl and screech on autocast, it will growl every 5 seconds and then screech every 7 seconds. 
---
... with claw AND screech, with focus coming back in chunks and not at a smooth rate, you’ll have times when growl is missed and a claw is used, screech is missed and a claw is used, etc. I’d just keep claw for dungeons personally.
---
Yeah no problem. I heal dungeons as feral. I'm not even wearing int gear. I have to drink a lot but healing is no problem.
---
Yeah, Warriors are cool too, main issue is that I would like to be able to make some money with an alt and not sure how good they are at farming stuff and such. Also I have just leveled a melee auto-attacker class, although warriors seem rather more involved.
---
As far as I can tell you can't except through guessing from +healing and the magnitude of the heal. It's not in the combat log.
---
Alliance has better racials for pve and palladins are better for pve then shamans.
---
This is the correct answer and the mentioned tournament I’d advice to watch to get a sense of 1v1 class performance (even though it’s on private servers)
---
Not really but it's a good amount for the level
---
I somehow manage to take success in all dungeons, I hardly ever wipe, even though I solo tank ubrs, which the last 2 rooms are a shit show of threat dropping cc.
---
Get to the finish line, and start tanking for other 60's, the problems are not solved, but atleast you are rewarded well. Been solo tanking ubrs while dual wielding for a couple of weeks now. It's quite easy, but threat is hell bear the end.
---
What a clown you are
---
All the posts we get from tanks complaining people are pulling ahead of them, losing aggro, blaming it on retail kids, are made by people who can't play properly, sucked in retail, they still suck in vanilla much to their surprise and cannot cope and gotta blame it on someone since god forbid you are the problem. 
---
There you go.
---
Some classes like rogues and warriors don't get downranked versions because there's no point, the resource cost/cast times are the same but only the damage increases.
---
I've full int gear as I'm healing anyways but feral is mind numbingly boring for me
---
 Could you send me a pm with your build for end game? Thanks
---
"lul"
---
"Force you to rely on auto attackes"
---
That is enhancement shaman.
---
What server / faction you on?
---

---
Ur opinion. As thisnis mine . Id rather watch new model orc  warrior  vs the square tin can i have now
---
''how me not wanting to wait 8 hrs for a server is a my fault''
---
Well, while the rest of us were waiting you were leveling on a different server with barely any competition from your own, and the opposing faction.
---
We were stuck in queue so that we can secure a high-pop experience in the long run, which you did not.
---
Also there's a bigger chance to get realm transfer from high pop -&gt; low pop over the other way around.
---
Arms and Fury spec increase your damage output by quite a bit, especially levels 20 - 40. As you kill mobs quicker, you'll level quicker.
---
/cancelaura Predatory Strikes
---
/cancelaura Leader of the Pack
---
in your powershift macro bro
---
Holy Paladins are rather strong in wpvp, especially at lower gear levels this leads to some wpvp inbalance.
---
How noble that you even mentioned warriors, the worst of all 1v1 classes
---
I had a guy unironically try to argue with me that alliance was better in pvp because gnomes have escape artist
---
at level 16 you would normally have around 0-2g depending on class, so by that standard it's good.
---
&gt; Where am I supposed to stand?
---
Rogues do it from behind. Unless that may pull more mobs, in that case proceed with blaming tank who don't know what to do.
---
Now you bond in...
---
STV
---
Got to mid 30s 3 times and rerolled onto another server each time, almost 40 this time though. Also have like 6 level 10s trying out different classes.
---
I have not played 29 BGs, but won't people rather use Corpsemaker from RFK? Just slightly lower DPS but instead comes with massive +str + sta.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/team/apes
---
Yeah so I started like that and I enjoyed it at the lower levels don't get me wrong but as I have climbed up people have become more toxic but hey will work it out. 
---
I appreciate a great tank and try to give them time to pull mobs. Personally I prefer to pull if I am tanking as it gives me extra time( he says lol) and its not a straight race to pull threat. 
---
True true I do not mind wiping I am in no rush. as long as the team accepts what happens and moves on
---
I decided to keep a list of shitty DPS... then after a few runs, I realized that it would be easier to keep a list of Good DPS players.
---
And I ran quite a lot of dungeons so far.
---
&gt;I feel like most of the time I'm trying to get/stay in position to be able to shoot, get 2-3 shot in and targets dead. Next!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; I think I would have been happier with a mage 
---
Can confirm, it is much better to spend most of the time trying to get/stay in position to be able to cast, get 1-2 frostbolts in and the target is dead. Then sit down and drink.
---
On a serious note, that is ranged damage in a nutshell. When I'm drinking after every second pull I like to watch the rogues and warriors dispatch a couple of groups until I'm ready again and pretend I'm somehow useful just by buffing int and bringing water. Then we need to aoe a single pack, my damage on that fight is \~90% of group damage and everyone screams "OMG! Mage is f\*ing OP it's not even funny" and they clear the next three bosses while I drink. I guess it's all about perspective.
---
ok that makes sense.  my definition would be a bit different.  for my thinking starts when your feet start to hurt because you have walked through the ancient center of Rome for 5 hours and now your wife wants to visit de 'Via del Corso' as well,  to go shopping.....
---
Retail is surprisingly bait with its leveling, 1-30 is super easy and can be done in like 2.5 hours but then you slowly start to ramp up time, levels are taking 30-60 minutes each and dungeons are slower than questing unless your group is really quick 
---
That's why I'm conflicted about going back to retail to prep for 8.3 and 9.0 - I gotta grind back to 120 and try to avoid the 60-90 burnout range, and then hope the class I chose is actually as fun as the class trial made it seem. That's on top of the pre-order for 9.0 definitely giving you an instant 120 boost, do I wait for that or save it for a future alt?
---
But why be so quick to just say nonsense?
---
Haha indeed...
---
The rogue in this clip never even opened.
---
Luna shows the green bars and Luna also has the numbers on the frames. To show the outgoing heals is mikscrollingcombattext

silence while loving is such a turn-off
---
Booo
---
I played a human and a gnome as my first two toons, and I never really played a night elf so I finally got around to making one. Got to Darnassuss for the first time ever, and it was the saddest moment in game: a major city with no one in it. Not sure what they were thinking with that location, such a shame. The Horde equivalent, Thunderbluff, is usually quiet but not creepy ghost town quiet.
---
Wp, wp.. My condolences for your loss...
---
I agree it's experience.
---
I started at the end of TBC so the game was already nerfed compared to the course of vanilla, yet I remember it as being much more difficult then it is now.
---
More than 10 years of playing different MMOs definitely made me a much better player than I was back then, making everything a lot easier as a consequence.
---
I wouldn't want it changed though because there are definitely many people playing WoW for the first time, they still have to learn, while people that find the game too easy can still find challenges for themselves by fighting higher level mobs for example, or downgrade their skills or even gear.
---
Hey bro I know reading can be hard sometimes but at least try '' The dude that won against me today was a holy paladin and he wanted it for his Ret-pvp offspec'' He joined as holy, was healing the entire dungeon perfectly fine how can I know he wanted to roll for his offspec against my main spec?
---
I'm leveling a pally and not sure what professions to go for. BS doesn't seem worth it, maybe herb/alch?
---
someone file that bug report
---
It's more that the item is a unique mace in both it's visuals and proc while ALSO being a potentially amazing weapon for Tanking.
---
But whether or not it's good depends on it's proc.   Everybody is farming it due to it's rarity, uniqueness, and potential power.  Not just because of random bragging rights.
---
Can confirm, I was offering enchants for free when I was leveling it around 150, no takers.
---
Watch out I have seen people go that path. They watch these shaman montages and after playing they realise that to get windfury to crit properly has extremely low chance. It's not like your every third attack destroys people it's more like every 1000th hit does this.
---
Yeah, only use I can see for it is if you have 60-100 rage and you know that the modicum of extra damage is gonna bring the mob into execute range.
---
Oh, I see. Not really relevant to raids/dungeons then, but useful for slowing and maybe PvP I guess.
---
awesome video!
---
Thanks for your input, I guess hunter's can feel kinda underwhelming in some aspects. I will have to think on it some more.
---
Ill confirm.
---
Dang. Heart attack or diabetes?
---
I have never seen so many mechonochicks in one screenshot
---
The one in the north is supposed to be stratholme.
---
Just as ridiculous as any fantasy element in this game. It's a game. Realism can only make games boring and bland.
---
Really? That was the second thing I looked at lol
---
Horde and Dreadmist
---
Circle self-identifies tank so bear can watch where bear is.
---
I meant instead of reloading, I was able to simply mouse over the exp bar once to get it to load the text forever.
---
Spec really doesn't matter that much until 50+ imo. I even ran uldaman with a lvl45 shaman tank a couple of days ago. You can get away with doing so much stuff sub-optimally if you think about what you're doing as a group and account for weaknesses.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Stuck between shaman and warrior here. I like the warrior, but without a group it's so damn slow. Shaman at least can solo level, and is more versatile in dungeons. I'm just a bit concerned about the end-game.
---
Aren't they all gnomes though? Apes has always been a PvP guild.
---
I lost almost all faith in DPS. At this point you get the salvation if you want or not. Sometimes I make an exception for rogues and hunters because for them BoM and BoW are fairly important and they have enough utility to stay alive... but that privilege is quickly removed once they to "tank" again.
---
İt is awesome but sadly it doesnt sold in where i live. There is only 110 model which i think way below A300. :(
---
You're supposed to roll for it, otherwise ranged/healer has no chance of getting it. Thus should be common sense.
---
I think yes, but I’m not sure ... the question is, does this weapon can be an alternate option to the pummeler ?
---
If its only for classic wow, 
---
Buy something thats like a gtx 1050 with an i5. 500gb storage and like 8gb of ram. Should do you fine with wow classic, email youtube vids and such.
---
At 250 tailoring you can make Mooncloth. On my server, Felcloth goes for around 1.5-2g, and Mooncloth (requires 2 Felcloth, a Moonwell, and a 4 day cooldown) sells for 20-25g. A 20g profit every 4 days isn't a whole lot once you're past level 50, but for more casual players it definitely helps and can pay for your skills.
---
There is one on the right, near the middle, is literally nothing. They silently sunk it into the ocean with cata. It never had a name or a purpose.
---
Is it not necessary or is it bad to tank lower levels in prot. I'm someone who likes to go down those trees leveling so I want to know what to expect.
---
&gt; eventually the zandalar buff will be on the list too.
---
And Dire Maul buffs.
---
Many thanks!
---
Streaming their leveling would have resulted in Horde stream sniping them. It's hard to AOE farm when people are ganking you.
---
Nah, he's raiding, eat it all alone.
---
Pickpocketing is a lot of money
---
Annything in dungeons for gray items
---
My friend who is discovering wow is often asking why we are skipping some quest like that sometimes.
---
My answer is always "Believe me kid, you don't want to know"
---
nobody wants a ret paladin in pvp either, so yeah if you want to be a solo player forever (why? might as well go to retail) then feel free to stay ret
---
Well, I know what I'd be spamming in Trade chat if that happened to me.
---
You can change B to open all bags instead of just the backpack, just check out the keybindings :)
---
No Arms as I was struggling with Proc. Its not the set up that is my issue I am fine its just the time I am given to get threat and then when I fail to do so because someone is AOE the world get blamed for it
---
Stop talking man. There were GRIND and eHeroes players. Top 10 guilds on Horde Gehennas so whilst they were maybe not as geared as APES it's definitely not a huge gap.
---
Also APES loses fights all the time on Gehennas. I would say Salad Bakers are in general way more annoying to deal with due to the guild being #2 on Alliance Gehennas but with way more members.
---
a good rogue will ALWAYS win.he just stuns you for 90% of your HP.Shaman vs rogue is only equal if the shammy has a trinket,otherwise rogue will win 99% of the times.If you think I am wrong,you just have not seen a good rogue
---
A mage that charges his pug for water. Wtf lol. And also, groups normally wait after everyone has buffed one another to get mana back. Not sure what the issue is. If it was just the one buff, just buff them and keep going, doesn't cost that much mana.
---
Gnome kill on sight
---
Oh god. I knew I had to go somewhere else, but totally forgot it was in Uldaman. Thanks for the horrific reminder.
---
Oh really? I did not know this! Cheers!
---
Warriors in PVP gear do exceptionally well.  It's more about the team you have, not the gear of individuals.  Does play in part when it's organized vs organized, but most orgs are going to just roll PUGs all day.  Warriors are a pain in the ass to level, as expected, but in the end, it's worth it.  Had a warr and rogue in vanilla, and the warrior I liked more to be honest.  Rogue was fun for just ganks.
---
What does need  before greed do?
---
I love it. Doesn't matter if there isn't a reward. My 27 hunter will always prioritize ganking/wpvp over leveling.
---
a ret in disguise is still a ret.  if you are in a pug you can always ask at the start of a run.
---
/bow
---
Oh hell yeah!
---
Too bad, that would have been really cool to see.
---
herb/alch is useful for every class, but I think it's more useful for classes that don't have a self-heal, as the health potions often are a lifesaver for them. Still, the profession offers a lot of quality-of-life improvement for the levelling process, in the form of trolls blood potions for example, or PvP, with free action potions.
---
Go to undercity, find a guard, right click, click weapon master and then follow your map to the weapon guy. 2H/1H swords are there. Trained them on my tauren last night.
---
Ah, sorry. I usually open with Cheap Shot.
---
Just stop dude. You’re wrong. Accept it. Others told you. I told you. Lol
---
Do druids have any threat dropping abilities? Priests have care that we can use to avoid this situation, maybe druids have one too and he just wasn't using it?
---
RP-PvE server
---
Oh is that mob CC'd...let me just Corruption it for you.
---
-Every Warlock
---
No they really are arseholes which is why many guilds actively avoided them when choosing a server on Classic. Maitoz in particular is a shitbag who delights in bragging about how good his guild is.
---
Does anyone know if there is a thought process behind choosing a faction as APES?
---
For example does Alliance give something special that will help them perform or gain a slight advantage or does it come down to just preference?
---
Less competition during launch/leveling?
---
Looking for worthy opponents on opposing side?
---
Just throwing ideas as a new player. 
---
Really enjoyed the many aspects of the video and the comments here pointing them out.
---
That's if it's inside a dungeon. If he says "I was there first" he probably was outdoors. In which case, it's first person to reach it, regardless of rolls.
---
Quick!  We need somebody who took a screenshot of daisy 2+ days ago!
---
It may be a bit silly, but I still like the way you think. :D
---
Just take time off for World first race (like Method does) and then play like usual after the first few weeks. Ain't rocket science.
---
Nowdays you cant run Stratvliving without reserving 1 orb or all blues/greens to tank.  Nobody wants to tank it for free
---
Love posts like this, its genuinely adorable. 
---
Orcs start with axes and 2h axes, you dont need to learn that.
---
You can get 2h swords training in Undercity from the weapon master in the war quarter (talk to a guard to find exact location).
---
Hamstring is for slowing things that are running away from you, you shouldn't be trying to use it to kite too much during normal combat.
---
It's ok to use 2h weapons at your level. They attack slower but hit much harder and your abilities (like heroic strike) scale based on your weapon's raw damage.
---
1. I set the avatar to the position I like
---
2. I press Esc
---
3. I click "Exit game"
---
I tried also tried "fixing" the avatars by right click &gt; Move Frame &gt; Lock Frame
---
Mobs cannot dodge from behind, so your attacks hit more frequently when you're attacking from the rear.
---
Skull is always the best to target. When that's not the case, then attacking whatever the tank is at the moment is the best bet.  If you attack anything the tank isn't hacking on directly,  you'll generate threat and take aggro.
---
There aren't enough quests in the game to get exalted with any faction. You have to do turn one. Revered is only halfway to exalted.
---

---
I'm now doing guild runs with people who have threat meters running and are usually fairly disciplined. Even they ask for salvation because then they can go brain afk and don't have to worry. At some point -30% threat will equal 30% more damage.
---
I always been playing arms and tanking fine with it. But I'm considering Fury and Unbridled wrath both for tanking and solo questing to have access to more rage. 
---
Also I heard 2H Fury and even Dualwield Fury is generally faster while leveling.
---
But it's all up to you bro, and how you want to build your character also :)
---
Gl hf!
---
Very nice breakdown. Watching these guys coordinate is something I haven’t seen in the game in a long time.
---
POE TAY TOES
---
understandable on EU servers though with language barriers (people still join english servers when they speak really bad english)
---
Part of the fun of a PVP server. The other faction are your enemies and may harass you at any time and you need to keep an eye out. Getting ganked relentlessly in the yeti cave whilst questing is a waste of my time and the corpse camping is just griefing. But it's allowed.
---
Simply, if you think there is someone on the boat who may grief you, get the next boat.
---
I sheep enemies for fun and it sometimes gets them into trouble; especially ones running away from a large pack they've pulled.
---
Oh yes, people knew that when they rolled
---
You can automate actions like this on a hunter. Both in pvp and pve. Sometimes you need to cast cheetah to kite players and mobs. Tbh i use cheetah more odten than hawk in leveling but hawk is good af. All you need is
---
/cast Aspect of Cheetah
---
/cast Aspect of Hawk
---
 And just get used to switching them dont automate anything on hunters you need to be flexible to whatever is ahead
---
I'm just saying, just yesterday they tried to kill Sylvanas because of the cinematic and failed spectacularly. This thread makes it seem like they're some unstoppable force. Also I personally don't mind APES, whilst I would gladly corpse camp Salad Bakers alts lmao.
---
Raided both as a 18/2/31 shadow priest.  Healed the entire time, just maintained shadow weaving when needed.  You run into a lot of enrage timers after MC, so most bosses became DPS races once you got the strategy down.
---
A mage wanting to keep resilience out of the game so he can 1 shot people.. why am I not surprised.
---
Resilience was the best thing they ever did to PvP, the problem was balancing PvP around 2v2 and 3v3 arenas instead of 5v5+
---
Vuhdo and mouseover macros do it for me. Highly customisable, but takes a while to set up and get how you like it. You can even customise audio cues for debuffs and stuff on group members
---
Who can forget the warriors embrace
---
These are unpopular opinions, its kind of the point
---
Well, it is a grind, but there are options you can go back and do low level quests cause they give rep normaly only exp is lost. Or you can grind cloth and give it to Quartermaster Raedon Duskstriker in Darnassus. Both ways are grind probably out of the way for you to continue leveling and geting rep at same time.
---
You don't seem to understand what mastering means. It means the mechanics are essentially of trivial difficulty to you. Trivial difficulty does not mean ignoring, but being able to ignore something that is trivial to begin with is also of little significance.
---
It's a bit stressful once you first get them, but as soon as they get in 1 tick of food, it's a non issue.
---
Phase 2 is gonna be insane watching Apes. These guys are next level
---
You don't need to play 12-18h a day 7 days a week. You take vacation for world first and play as usual after 2 weeks of hardcore raiding.
---
Prehealing without a threat reduction is a bad idea its safer to let you take some hits then cast a heal to manage threat. Its not like as a tank youre going to die in 2 hits.
---
Anyone know any less used areas I could AoE farm as on my mage?
---
Level 40 frost mage, specced for AoE grinding but competition for Lost Rigger Cove is insane on my server at the minute
---
Demo shout, even after the fix, is still a crucial skill for tanking more than 1 mob, if nothing else it at least binds the mobs for a few heals. And Revenge should always be used when available, top priority (even over sunder armor)
---
Just writing, because you didn't mention both.
---
No and i think transmog is the worst thing in retail after lfr
---
Okay?
---
I never used it but there is a permanent lung juice cocktail.
---
I know this is a few days old, but what river are you farming? Cause I can't seem to find one in NW Arathi, unless you're talking about the one in Hillsbrad that spawns sagefish?
---
Those are not multiboxers, I followed them for a bit and saw that the path they are following is always the same and they both are following it with a pixel precision. They are most of the time at different positions on the path, the image I took was a pure luck when one of them just came at the exact same moment the other finished a mob, so they were "synchronized".
---
Viagra is blue..
---
R I N S E D
---
Everyone in apes is gnome or dwarf for the racials. Expect for the two druids of course
---
Now this is probably going to go the same route as the Daisy Dukes. :(
---
Resto shaman don't kill things. You keep things alive. You're not going to win 1v1s unless you out-gear your opponent, or they are bad.
---
Btw how live event of method ended?
---
My daughter passed away a year ago. We started playing WoW together back in vanilla when she was only 9. I have made her original NE Hunter in classic and even though I am horde through and through I play it as much as possible to remember her.
---
Open and close
---
Nice I use Displays and its really hands but a lot of randoms don't seem to run one at all. That threat reduction is crazy
---
I saw the shaman abilities and instantly knew whats up. Still glad i saw the fat procs
---
Nothing wrong with a bunch of bros helping each other feel good.
---
Just make sure to say No Homo and make sure the Balls don't touch.
---
Its ok if the Dikks touch tho, its called Frottage and it is beautiful.
---
Good to know, I kind of figured it was just the pseudo-wholesome act Reddit chubs put on.
---
I am not going to argue with you. You could look it up as easily as me.
---
I've seen some priests with a lot of T1.
---
Some tips I've found get you thanks from the tank/healer in dungeons as a rogue:
---
1) Use kick to interrupt anything you can. There's an addon that shows enemy cast bars so you can easily see when to use it. When kick is on CD you can run around to the front real quick and use gouge to, or even kidney shot once you get it. 
---
2) Start stealthed whenever you can. Add a pickpocket macro to the beginning of your openers to incentivize this. Use a fastloot addon + autoloot to make it instant. The nice thing about doing this is it takes you an extra second to start hitting them, and that gives the tank enough time to get a bit of agro before you hit them with the insane rogue burst damage. 
---
3) Use crippling poison on one of your weapons to keep enemies from running away quickly and pulling more. Kidney shot works well too. Both of these can easily prevent wipes. 
---
4) It's easy for you to break off and go after enemies that go after the healer since you have so many stuns and other tools, and if you start taking damage, you have a lot of damage mitigation tools as well. 
---
5) Whenever there's a caster that didn't group up with the rest, I like to run up and kick them so they get interrupted and run to the tank. 
---
Also, you wanna stand behind the enemy the tank is targeting because you'll do more damage that way.
---
Lol are you tanking zf with 1 hand? XD also try battle and demo shout
---
Ahh,   Then yes please report them :).  They are most likely gold sellers or someone trying to test their bot program or something along those lines.
---
Really nicely written and informative. Thank you for this!
---
I use Shield on warriors/Druids when they’re low health or surrounded by multiple elites,this gives me time to cast my max rank healing spell, I rarely use shield as it is unless I’m solo. But I am however only level 38 so.....
---
I liked the level scaling in ESO - it meant that I could go and quest anywhere I felt like when I was levelling each char.
---
It's a little annoying that levelling up means becoming less powerful as your gear gets de-scaled. But that is way better than the nonsense about over-levelling quests, or being concerned about what zone of the game I was in.
---
Everyone knows condom goes on MT since he penetrates first.
---
But Monkeynews literally streamed almost his entire 1-60? Are you trolling or whatsup?
---
Crippling is clutch. Bleed kiting is a little advanced but can work really well. Using gouge (without a bleed up) is amazing for pooling energy. Rogue has a really fun toolkit. 
---
I ALWAYS run double crippling in PvP. Getting that slow up is really important. You can also bleed kite warriors in their deadzone. Easier said than done tho.
---
No everyone is gnome or dwarf. Escape artist is op for pvp. There are 2 nelf druids though
---
what dumb warrior rolls on agi gear? lmao
---
hat, chest, shoulders, belt and boots are all Pre-raid bis
---
They don't even have humans in the guild because they are all in on pvp. I would say that the biggest misconception about classic is that hord has an advantage in Pvp.
---
For a casual, I concur - but for APES (and quite a few other guilds/clans) they are a well known, established group of people who dedicate all their time to playing WoW as professionally as you can do (12+ hours a day).  So, again, my point stands.  Anything else you'd like me to address?
---
good point I decided to stay with herbs
---
This isn't super helpful, but yes I found an addon that does this a few days ago, I just can't remember the name. Works well enough though. If somehow you don't have an answer before I get home from work I'll let you know what it is.
---
Yeah, I'm all for doing the hand ins, just wanted to know if there are any way to make it more effective or get a bit further with quests.
---
Love your artwork. The colours, shadows and doodlish look. Amazing.
---
Sorry to hear about your friend. Glad to see you are playing the Chad fire spec instead of the beta frost spec.
---
Hi, first time playing wow and i managed to reach lvl 40 but im still 50 gold short for my mount.
---
Most guides said to save every gold so you could get mount at 40 but im not even close must have farmed way too little.
---
Since im mostly solo what is the recommended way to make gold for mount?
---
Farm beasts or should i try to get in more dungon parties?
---
It did, it was called Northeron and it was supposed to be a huge lore spot because it was where wildhammer dwarven settled after grim batol became a spooky place. It was also supposed to have an interesting landscape from how they described it
---
I believe there are a few very solid spots in Dustwallow Marsh if I'm not mistaken.
---
That's because only they can drop it. :)
---
As someone who never played alliance back in the day and only finally made an alliance character in classic for an ALT...
---
Paladin is the most fun class to play.
---
Ofc, but in that case rogues have nades, blind, sprint (removes slow with talent). Rogues are very strong vs hunters if the rogues know how to use his arsenal =) Ofc a good hunter is strong as well.
---
I've been in un'goro all afternoon yesterday and there were more horde than alliance (like everywhere else) and a couple of groups felt ballet enough to gank me, so yeah, no. Un'goro is like every other zone in gehennas, horde dominated.
---
I believe TradeSkillMaster (TSM) shows this but I am not entirely certain.
---
Well, ignore those people. Check your ignore list when joining a party.
---
If you want an actual list, you can always make a note in your phone or something? Or have an actual notebook next to you when you play.
---
I like how you italicize holy like it matters and you still didn't have a class advantage lol.
---
It's not that players (healers most of all) would not appreciate a Prot specced tank also at lower levels - it's just much slower for soloing and doing stuff outside dungeons, and no one is expecting you to level as Prot. That very much applies to healers, since most healers you encounter in dungeons will be leveling in a DPS spec due to much more efficient that is. You do encounter the occasional Prot/Holy/resto guy on lower levels as well, and even if it is appreciated it is a rare thing.
---
I’ve been there recently doing the Murlocs, but at the point now where they’re all around 35-37 so I barely get xp, unless you know of another spot in the zone?
---
Missing Sacrx The Machine
---
You do realize that you're talking to an APES member, right? That have actually walked the walk. I'm working right now, lmao.
---
Why do people even go retri when 31/20/0 deals more dmg and on top of that you heal more and you can actually beat anyone 1v1
---
Next time they wont have it but they have already established dominance and fear lol
---
This isn’t actually true. That only applies in BGs. Open world and duels weapon skill still matters.
---
I believe they do not, but the resto tree may have threat reduction talents.
---
I'm level 29 and have a 65 mining skill level.  I don't have the ability to smelt tin even though I can mine it. I went to the Stormwind mining trainer but Journeyman level wasn't availble at the trainer, nor was Smelt Tin. 
---
Does anyone know the current minimum requirements?
---
They get a triviality punishment in Vanilla afaik, so when they are gray they only give 20% of the rep IIRC. Otherwise that would have been my go to method.
---
Got any tips for good places to grind the cloth if that is the most viable method? Thank you!
---
He has three spawn points (that in fairness are relatively close together), wanders around, and there is some debate about his respawn timer. I used to think it was 8 hours but I've heard fairly reliable reports of him respawning in the same layer in 4 hours. So call it 4-8 hours. Depending on how populated your server is, it could be easy to get him or every layer could have someone staked out at each spawn point.
---
Ough my man, im not questioning your character. As someone who works with automation this just puzzled me. Cuz the app sending keystrokes to the wow instance can be automated along with other things.  And i dont see how can it be distinguished from a bot
---
&gt; why there where so many hordes waiting?
---
You can do raids every week, and for a 15 year old one it gets boring.  But organized PVP is much more exciting!   So when it's known that the top dog guild will come to the Black Rock Mountain. other gather their to fight them, that's just how it goes.  Bragging rights.  This time the Horde got their asses beaten badly  , but next week they will try again, and try a different strategy.   This is what makes the game so great.
---
Wait, you can change loot rules during combat and it takes effect?  They should fix that.  Then if they change it right before the pull I can just dip out.
---
For spirit build, drop mental strength, take spirit tap instead. Doubles your spirit on killing blows.
---
That was definitely a human. I think your eyes are full of blood.
---
Mutants guild member on Faerlina it would seem
---
Are you sure he was smiling because of the pet?
---
That poor glove was waiting for you :P
---
After a PvE mob more than 2 levels above the caster it's -11% to hit for every additional level of difference. That means 28% base chance to hit. If the priest is fully specced into the respective shadow talent, it'd be 38% chance on 48 lvl bosses.
---
And that's before we count that Mind Flay and some other SP spells can also be partially resisted even after they hit.
---
So... They'd be doing about 1/3 of the DPS. And that's without considering that Spriests get a new rank of SWP and Mind Flay at 42 and 44.
---
A little of this, a little of that. My main income was probably from grinding and selling grays/greens (most to vendors, some on AH) and vendoring low level leathers and occasionally squeezing a bit of AH profits out of those as well. Doing some SM Arm/Cath runs can be quite profitable with a fast group, silver drops add up and the occasional green/blue you win on Greed can vendor for 1+ gold. I also mostly refrained from buying gear upgrades from AH, only did so when it was a bargain price, and I had a bunch of unbought skills at level 40. Some of those will remain unbought forever, whereas some semi-useful/useful ones I grabbed after buying my mount. 
---
Also did not upgrade professions to Artisan until after mount, even if that meant I was capped on Skinning - but it's easy to catch up on that one.
---
Using VW is a rookie mistake!
---
Agreed, but to put it in perspective: im 51 with 100g bagged right now, all skills bought and had to pay my mount + riding skill. 30g vs 190g is quite the difference. But yeah, it the bigger scheme of things its penny change.
---
For alliance they are.
---
How are you interacting with enough toxic players that you need a list of those not to play with?
---
Let me guess, Holy Aura from Paladin + Crusader Judgement?
---
With both it's once you start getting to let's say ruggged leather and thorium where it starts definitely being worth it. As someone else mentioned, rarer things like silver and gold can fetch a good price anyway.
---
Yeah combining them is the way to go man. You'll want the addon "faster loot" https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/faster-loot
---
 and you'll need autoloot to make it all work without interruption, but it works great, and the nice thing is you don't ever have to remember to do it anymore, it just happens from regular playing. I finished an RFK run last night and had like 20 locked junkboxes in my inventory afterword which helps level up my LP.
---
Much more expensive and not that much better.
---
Yeah, good points, and I do use demo shout on the pull to stick then to me until I can get some sunders up. Revenge is used whenever it procs, buy I was unsure if I should use shield block to force a proc, or if the rage was better spent on sunders.
---
I also keep battle shout up. Helps dps, but also rage gen, and it's decent aoe threat if you can hit everyone with it.
---
WASH YER BACK
---
Think you are hyping their «skill» bit too much here :D
---
Shortcuts to 60, very likely they 'abused' farming leveling dungeons in a raid, but afaik this is not a proven fact. As for gear, they almost went straight into MC without gearing. Their main tank did 2 UBRS runs prior.
---
Well, both are aimed for kids at the same age span =D
---
BGs are crossrealm so horde and alliance queues are going to be similar.
---
You mean staves are maces with DLC for the head.
---
Won't happen. Even if we were able to tune the hybrid specs to make them viable, the tier sets are all geared towards the "expected" role a class is supposed to take and you'd have to redo the tier system to make it work. And at that point you have rebalanced classes and rebalanced gear, you might as well go for TBC relaunch.  Which personally is what I'm gonna do.  I'll probably hit level cap next month and unsub until they re-release TBC
---
I can understand people like it, but do you really pull information out of it? That's what im curious about.
---
Is that a streamer server?
---
Rogue is one of your easiest 1v1 matchup as elemental, and it only gets better the more gear you get. Once you can start to amass a good amount of spell crit in mail gear, you can more or less just dps them down with shocks, Fire Nova Totem and lightning shield while healing yourself and keeping blinds and slows to a minimum with a mix of cleanse poison and Poison Cleansing Totem. 
---
The matchup only scales favourably for you the more gear you get.
---
Takes like a few seconds if no queue.
---
I can't speak for OP, but I like to use the addon I use to keep track of nice people too, and to help me return favors from random world interactions.
---
Stay arms till 52-54ish. Then swap to the prot build you prefer
---
Personally I look towards either "impale prot" or, more likely, "31prot arms fury" as Mc for me is nowhere near
---
tabard + shirt dude
---
Thank you for eli5
---
I leave for work around 9, I come home from work at around 17.30 and go to bed at 22.30-23.30. If you have that kind of time and are willing to dedicate most of it to WoW I see no problem having the time to achieve what APES are doing.
---
One Coldsnap nerf please.
---
I don't know who is everybody, but most of the rogues are gnomes for a reason not dwarves. You can use escape artists in a lot more situations than stoneform. You don't need the advantage of stoneform vs a warrior or druid, so it would only help you vs a rogue.
---
That's what it seemed like. Or that the boss had no aggro table, so only the "forces target to attack you" effect was keeping him on me.
---
I checked wowhead, and there's no mention of this mechanic, but I didn't read the comments. I might check those.
---
This felt really good seeing, as someone who plays on a wildly horde dominated realm (Firemaw) and have to deal with full teams of horde holding blackrock mountain every day. I want APES on my realm too.
---
Ah yeah, my favorite thing is seeing TANK LFG STRAT LIVING ... ALL ORBS AND BOES REZ.  I see it far too much.  I mean hell, even someone in my own guild is constantly talking about what he has reserved for himself... just makes it so none of us wanna actually group with him.
---
Certain prices are significantly lower than they should be, as there are different layers with different resources on, there are more of these resources to be farmed with potentially less competition. More competition/less resources bumps the price of a product up. Basically supply and demand is off because of layering.
---
his hands were flashing/lightening when he was getting closer to the druid as some kind of racial/buff/etc though.
---
Do you even count the npc in hinterlands that sell only lvl 10 and 25 arrow, and don’t have the jagged lvl 40 one .. in hinterlands zone lvl 40/50 :)
---
I'll take this as a, "I have no basis."
---
A sequence of abilities comes about as a result of "crunching the numbers."  That's what makes the META - Most Effective Tactic Available.  
---
And a lot of people find discovering and following that META to be fun.
---
A lot of people find soloing to be fun.  Just as a lot of people enjoy raiding with their guild, or simply running dungeons with randoms.
---
So excuse me if this gem:
---
&gt; Your comment paints a picture of the oracle of WoW knowledge but it reads to me like a min-maxer without a comprehension of cooperation and having fun. 
---
...Comes off as more than a little self-important.  It clearly explains where your coming from with the rest of your response, and the only interpretation I have of it is, "your way to play is the wrong way to play."
---
Except you don't get to determine what I or anyone else finds fun.  You get to suggest what might do more harm than good long term despite people finding it fun in the short term, but you don't get to determine what other's find fun.
---
I use the friends list for that, thier names seperate them so i dont get confused.
---
Oh right? that doesn't really add any validity to what your saying, or disprove what I'm saying.  Out of interest what would you say is the average /played time for people in your guild?  I'll bet a quid to a pint of piss it's ridiculous for the time the game has been re-released.
---
At what level does wind fury get good? I am lvl 31 at the moment and I have noticed that wind fury does too little damage at the moment. Flametounge does way more dmg
---
Priest can put a shield on you to avoid bleed damage in stealth.
---
I wish people would at least realize when silk bandages sell for 40 silver to the vendor, I’m probably not going to sell you the silk for that price.
---
Felwood satyrs aren't half bad.
---
What server are they on?
---
Global ignore list— addon. You can block people and make a note and it will notify you if one is in your group.
---
Terrible Rogue. Doesn't know how to use Kick on those Entangling Roots.
---
Hahaha you guys are hilarious. No Onyxia buff and they would never clear MC
---
The most impressive thing about APES is how good of a ride you get on welfare in the EU. What they do is not possible on social assistance in North America. You have to be actually fucked up for social assistance here.
---
People won't get the difference about being time-efficent and throwing time randomly at the game.
---
WoW is really never the same without those friends you started playing it with. I hope this character brings you happiness and helps bring back good memories for you for years to come.
---
So I took mining for the money. Purely just money. Am I supposed to AH stuff or vendor bars I smelt? I've been getting mixed answers. 
---
Also, anyone know the first dungeon available to night elves who dont make the treck to stormwind (ti go to westfall for deadmines or stormwind for stockade)
---
Yeah I like seeing if I loose a buff without having to look at the top right of the screen during combat
---
Its the "Nordic-server" Its bigger than the streamer server.
---
I gave up and migrated this week.
---
See, this is what I hope they do with Classic. Open these areas and take Classic in a different direction from retail.
---
The point of such addon is so I don't have to check the list. It could even be for friends or people that helped me as well.
---
addon bartender
---
Yeah, but that's implied by you being there first, can't have been someone before you to fight mobs there if you were there first.
---
He means it takes 20s to give back the mana it costs to cast.
---
Plus actual shirts.
---
But a lot of them did stream their leveling.
---
I actually agree with this too
---
You sleep 9 hours a day during the week? Are you an infant?
---
Finally a nice mage clip. makes me wanna go back to my beloved mage.
---
At least for gnomes, they are created as in they became living creatures because of the curse of flesh.
---
YES
---
I had one exactly as he described, just take the door left, skip everything except a fire elemental and jump to arena. Even with accidental pulls we hit instance lock in 30 mins..
---
What's the best alt for gold making ("raw" gold from instance grinding prefered, as I'm on a very high pop server). I guess Hunter or Mage?
---
I am LOVING It....and these things are all quite true
---
Yup, I've felt overpowered below 60 honestly. Feel like I have a tool for everything, and when I don't, I just run away and reset the fight.
---
!remindme 2hours
---
I was referring to the Heigan example, where you have to run in order not to die. That means the melee cannot dps and the casters cannot cast. There are many situations like this even in MC if you wanted to use it. Baron Geddon or Ragnaros comes to mind. The mechanics may be trivial to perform flawlessly without any mistake, but you still have to follow the rules - in this case running instead of DPSing.
---
This is of course a miniscule advantage in MC and hardly worth to do. But improving the raid time by seconds or their dps meters by few points is what a guild like this strives for, since it's hard to improve when you are on the top.
---
Did you report him?
---
No real need. You can aoe down a good handful of mobs as prot pala without any gimmicks beyond some tank gear and aoe spec. I leveled from about 55 by aoeing in vanilla. 
---
It’s not incredibly efficient, but it’s something.
---
There are guides out there. Check wowhead and icy-veins. In addition, a beginners guide to MMOs in general might benefit you. If you have specific questions we can address, I've found the Reddit community here to be invaluable and very willing to help.
---
No I was being sarcastic lol should have added /s
---
Sounds like youre full of it guy
---
From top to bottom,
---
Eversong Woods

Ghostlands

Stratholme
---
Gilneas
---
"Twilight Highlands" - Cata
---
Stormwind
---
Extra Burning Steppes? No idea
---
Shores of Blasted Lands
---
No that's pretty much it. Keep BoW up, keep SoR up, auto attack and judge at the last second before it runs out. You can put ret aura up for a little extra damage if your not getting hit too hard. I wouldn't really recommend consecration against single targets because it's super mana inefficient, Holy Shock I really only use once to engage and hammer for fleeing targets because I'm lazy and don't want to chase. When you need to heal yourself let you health get down to like 20%, pop divine favor and holy light and get a full hp heal for free. If you don't go too crazy with mana you'll be able to go almost indefinitely without ever having to drink.
---
I don't think they used LoE here, you can see Moo is not using his, and the raidleader tells he will call it out if it was necessary.
---
Oh I haven't. Just feel it would be nice to be able to add people to a list with a note, and when I meet them again I get a pop-up of said note. Could be used for friendly people as well, now that I think about it.
---
I can tell if someone is not actually healer by how fast they go oOm and I think most who aren’t noobs can to.
---
Hope they use them for future content patches or expansions if they eve decide to expand Classic (hopefully on new server options though).
---
Oh, that be cool if you could tell me that later. Thanks!
---
RemindMe! 2 hours
---
I like being able to see *why* I wanted to remember their name later though, or I'd just go that route too.
---
I don't like RP servers because PVP is limited. On a RP-PVP server however it's totally different. There are organised faction wars. Guild battles. World events etc. The community is pretty solid for the most part and there is always something going on. Check this video as an example.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZXNIvuEuko
---
If you can get more from the AH for more than vendor price then absolutely do that (if it's worth your while)
---
Havent seen a single crossbow so far in this game
---
I know there is a sick one in bwl? but other than that ..
---
Compared to Will of the Forsaken, Escape Artist is far from op.

For the future: [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/dungeon-quests-classic-wow) is a list of all dungeons with level ranges and where to get the quests. Aim for the middle two numbers given for the range to start running that dungeon, i.e. for wailing caverns you may be able to start at 12 but it will be more comfortable at 14 (and easier to find a group that will actually take you).

I tried the emp lava skip 4 times. Died every time. Help.
---
Ignoring final bosses you shouldn't be doing armory until 37. Otherwise you will be crushing blowed and critical hit more often making it hard to tank and worse for the healer.
---
Or everquest
---
Not really. Escape Artist (gnome racial) is better. In rogue duels, human racial is OP. And NE racial is, basically, a free 5/5 in Master of Deception.
---
It's a meme, don't over-analyze it.
---
And power creep has it's own issues as we see in the current game. Everyone just does the newest raids unless it's for twinking or questing. Otherwise there's no reason to do Molten Core, No reason to do IceCrown Citadel. What they could do is have these new raids progress your character in different ways, or maybe be more fun to different play styles. Off the top of my head they could give a quest where you need to show you have a certain tier set fully completed, and you get something like a new ability, or talent point. If we think about the game in terms of just what World of warcraft has done we'll limit ourselves to what other games have already figured out.
---
True, I usually charge, aoe, then switch and just manage threat by cycling through targets and dropping sunder. I find the increase threat gen in defensive is worth being in for any sunder/shouts. Maybe make a macro to switch across for WW or aoe and back to defensive if you need to.
---
For end game tanking this is probably the way to do it, but I have tanked 3 dungeons with my arms warrior perfectly fine without marking. It does make it a little more chaotic but the rest of the players seems to enjoy the mayhem
---
This data seems to be quite inaccurate, I play on Wyrmthalak and it's heavily disproportioned towards Horde side. It's usually 5-10 of them to 2-3 of you in most questing spots.
---
True that! That quest chain is awesome I have heard.
---
What's your build? You should keep a tank/healer/dps set of gear on you. Doesn't have to be full sets, but even in healing gear you have tons on mana for shifting/healing and your forms still do pretty good damage.
---
I am not even trying to sell it on auc, but instead turn them in bandages and vendor them
---
Why waste time on this sub then?
---
imagine being so butthurt about getting ganked that you spend 4 hours following the person around. Just play on a PVE server man lol
---
My friend told me it's working on some demons too like in Desolace.
---
So, demons have pockets now or was he drunk like a dwarf? 
---
If true this is fucked up, next what ? Murlocs with backpacks ?
---
Shouldnt they evade?
---
I made a guild to honor my late father who passed away from cancer 3 years ago. Wow was his favorite past time.  My whole family plays classic and have played retail since vanilla.
---
300 herbalist here. Training herbalism takes 4g at the last stage. Money earned with herbs/pots is ZERO unless you are fine with selling a stack of herbs for 10-50 silver
---
Judgement helm and pants were ugly blue plate gear I believe. Faintly remember it. Aurastone hammer turned from the most regular hammer to a pretty cool looking one after the redesign.
---
But did you get the sword of a thousand truths
---
No.
---
Boil em
---
VW is not supposed to a be a main tank. More of an off tank. Fully DoT one target, the put your VW on a second target with just Corruption and SL.
---
VW allows you to very easily juggle 2-3 mobs and gives you a safety net bubble.
---
I dinged 47 last night, did some zf.  NO BIG DEAL.
---
Yessss but the eso playerbase seemed to like scaling.
---
He is probably a APES member
---
But why not use LFG not LF. Because it's almost unclear if LF is LFM or LFG. Although I guess if you state your class and level then you wouldn't be doing LFM, hm..
---
Nothing wrong with this armor (even if it doesn’t make sense). I am disappointed that it just looks like a normal chest piece on males though and not some kind of harness or halter.
---
Yes, I should've added that to the post. I'd like one that can be used for both, that would be great.
---
Rogu vs rogue is about getting an opener 90% of the time. Human racial perception is best for that
---
I'd imagine so; mobs are meant to evade if they can't reach you.
---
Blizzard would almost certainly consider this an exploit and dish out suspensions if people are abusing it.  Especially if they're stupid enough to publish it on Youtube :)
---
Heartseeker had more auctions up alliance side than Skeram yesterday - they have similar alli populations.
---
Luckily the groups I'm in if we're at level and geared we'll do that but if the mobs are quite a bit higher kevel we will mark accordingly.
---
My hunter sometimes grabs her quiver and starts swinging it like a sword. Lovely visual bug.
---
They've raided Molten Core hundreds and hundreds of times. They use world buffs to help speed up clear times. There is only so many times you can do a raid instance before it becomes a normal part of the grind like most things.
---
Honestly, if somebody lets you gank them for hours they should go see the brain doctor or so. 
---
Usually, this is just PvP behaviour. I mean they can always call for help or so.
---
Oh I see, youre a min/maxer. Not every is pro at wow. Thats the beauty at it.
---
Lol but isn't swimming out super far exactly what that character would do if there player doesn't come back in time?
---
Yeah. With retrospect I would have gone for my trusty Druid. Mage is fun (never played one at a high level either) but the saturation is serious. Plus imo life is so much easier as a tank or healer than as a DPS.
---
Thanks, I found him! 
---
Regarding hamstrings, I thought that it's an established method to reduce damage taken in combat. Either way, I'm not able to perform it properly at the moment.
---
Started WoW with Classic and only have a mage at 35, wanted to try out a Warrior and the mechanics are kind of different to mages (not to say more difficult,... at least yet). So I'm still a noob that has to figure things out!
---
Gnomes are way cuter.
---
They didn’t change the pants because it was hurting people, they changed the pants because they have a new preference against sexually charged outfits on human PC/NPC.  
---
Ironically, they did hurt a lot of kids in this thread by doing it.
---
Its absolutely gonna be patched out.
---
There are no dwarf priests on horde side.
---
Whats the addon called used for mana and life bars on the right?
---
Not at all
---
&gt;They changed the model for what is more than likely political reasons. That is disgusting. You do not cover up women's bodies because some sexist foreign power prefers it that way. It doesn't matter that its a few pixels, it's about having principles. 
---
Holy shit this is hilarious 😂 This is what a Fox News propaganda victim looks like, ladies n gents.
---
"DD"... We know you're shit haha. Its dps.
---
They go for like 10s if you're lucky on my server
---
Are you going to be alright? Do I need to call a Wambulance for the cry baby?
---
While you can do it a few levels earlier, once you hit level 22 you get enough talents and skills to be able to start aoe grinding on mobs and if you're good at the aoe rotation then you can aoe down massive packs of mobs in one go.
---
You have to pick certain groups of mobs, mainly ones that dont have ranged attacks - but you can literally pull an entire area of mobs, aoe them down, swap layers to get new mobs and rinse repeat.
---
The beds work too! +rp points!
---
Daim!
---
I dont think so. harassment i belive is ment with chat. like /w n stuff. Camping someone is part of the game in PVP server
---
A guy told me the server Flamelash was ''dead now'' and that everyone was at mograine, EU. Seems to be right as I literally spent a couple hours looking for a Deadmines group as dps and not one whisper.
---
I can free char transfer to: Bloodfang, Dragonfang, Earthshaker, Judgement or Mandokir. Which ones of these would be best in relation to high server population and decent amount of Alliance?
---
You said you were finding herbs that werent on your mini map, are you using the find herb ability that comes with herbalism? It will highlight any nearby herb on your minimap, the addon just shows where they can spawn not where they are.
---
If you're doing it just for money I would go herb skinning and vendor the leather unless you have a buddy you want to sell it to at vendor price. Herb doesnt make you much money early but once you get level 30 + the herbs can sell for 1 to 5 silver a piece and much higher the later in game.
---
But also just grinding usually ends up being the best money maker pre 60. I'm level 34 and found a decent spot where I can make about 5g an hour (6 or 7 if I sold my leathers) and that's just from vendoring the grey and white drops off the mobs with the occasional green (usually about 3 an hour)
---
Yes, I told you, vacation for world first and then play like usual. After being HC for 2 weeks at launch, the game takes minimal time. There's nothing to do.
---
Yeah same here, I just wanna get to 60 ASAP, plus questing as a Priest is extremely tedious, SW:P and just wand the target down gets old pretty fast.
---
I leave for work at 7am, that requires getting ready before that time (showering, shaving, getting into nice clothes, doing hair, feeding cat, etc) so I wake up around 6. I also don't fall asleep immediately after getting into bed. So no, I sleep 7-8 hours a day and will enjoy not having Alzheimer's when I am older.
---
This is how VW should be used. It's slower but cheaper.
---
No and it shouldn’t be either, make him quit :)
---
SENTIMENTAL PURPOSES LOL

---
Cheers,
---
\- Josh.
---
&gt; Any advice on how to overcome this hump?
---
If you don't enjoy playing, do something different. Forcing yourself to like something always backfires.
---
wow good one
---
There's a mod called character-notes that does this. I haven't tried it, but the comments on the curseforge page suggest that it works in Classic.
---
What UI addon is that?
---
I downloaded Spy, and over the course of an evening, added four names to my KoS.
---
I do not care for world pvp unless it's engaging. But I spare no mercy for arse holes.
---
This is just an example, I'm actually not out of The Barrens yet, but the topic came up in a stream and I'm interested in the ganking rules, have they changed? Because I remember that "physical" actions in game (as opposed to chat) like corpsecamping and training used to be allowed.
---
Can confirm. I’m a cousin
---
And then making a Reddit post about it.
---
Yetis in the cave have a 1/200 drop rate, which is really bad. Yetis to the north have a 1/1000 drop rate, might as well try to farm world epics.
---
No, open with garrote. The "backstab" opener is called Ambush, and you'll get it later, and unless you're trying to burst an enemy down asap, Garrote is typically more damage. Essentially, you're doing it right to use sinister strikes and eviscerate. Later, when you get slicendice, keep that up all the time, and on bosses in dungeons, consider rupture over eviscerate. Bleeds tend to do more damage overall, since that damage takes time.
---
Ambush and Backstab are more for subtlety rogues, and are more useful for pvp, though the great thing about rogues is how many options they have. Do I Garrote and rupture, then vanish and watch them struggle to overcome the bleeds? (Good against high armor classes). Do I Ambush and Backstab to try and burst them down? Do I stunlock them? It's a lot of fun.
---
Honestly the quote sounds weird to me. I don't know why. "I don't allow such things" doesn't have any kick to it. Maybe with an accent...
---
Try this. 
---
Equip your slowest 2 handed weapon.
---
See a pack of 3-4 mobs. Charge in. 
---
As u charge in use bloodrage.
---
Use sweeping strikes.
---
Swap to beserker stance and use beserker rage.
---
Use whirlwind.
---
Swap to sword and board and defensive stance.
---
Tab sunder/taunt of any mobs on heals.
---
You can do this in about 4-5 seconds. You will have to make macros for stance changing and weapon swapping so u don’t have to press many buttons. For example going from berserk stance with a 2 hander to sword and shield and defensive stance can be done with 1 button push.
---
This upfront burst damage will help you hold aggro longer. If you lose aggro you need to see who it’s going to and if it’s a threat. Most of the time it’s a mob probs nearly dead so just ignore it. If a fresh mob goes to the healer you need to get it off him.
---
Not a fellow mage, but please, DONT use this.. with any class.. Tanks are tabbing around to keep aggro on all targets and this is just bad advice..
---
7
---
Or Mouse 4.
---
Someone lied to you, keeping things in the bank doesn't cost money. Bank alts are literally just characters you create and sit in a major city outside the bank / AH to store items you want to keep or sell so you're not tying up space on your main character.
---
NO HUNTERS
---
30-40min is disgustingly quick to finish this quest. Are you the only player at the realm?
---
The rogue used cold blood though..
---
Oh, I know, but that isn't the case. It takes 20s for the Totem on its own to regain the mana it costs to cast, but as I said, the Totem doesn't exist in a vacuum, it acts on top of your already existing Manareg from spirit and mp/5. If I place the totem down it takes roughly six seconds for me to be at full mana again, due to the five second rule.
---
Priest here.
---
I bought nearly all skill levels for everything and leveled herbalism / alchemy 300/277 atm) with 45g now at level 46. Was able to get my mounth at level 43.
---
My suggestion: make a lvl 1 bank char, walk to UC/OGG and send cloth/greens and other possible valuables here. Before logging off check the AH and vendor prices and choose what to do.
---
Your bank char will slowly get cash whilst your main will vendor crap and buy skills. Your bank will pay the mount. This worked for me but took until 43 like I just mentioned
---
I need this for shaman
---
Thats reportable btw
---
Just go straight for dark pact, use succ, drain tank, DP your succ, after DP go for shadow burn.
---
Obviously there's a line. That line is a very long ways away from just making people uncomfortable though.
---
Duels I can say fairly confidently that it doesn't. Trained swords on my pally at level 12ish and dueled my buddy while at lvl 1 skill to see if you could train it. Every strike hit
---
What is LoE?
---
Hope to see you around :D
---
&gt; LoE
---
Hit 40 last week and felt this exact way. Not burnt out but just kind of overwhelmed at how much longer it’s gonna be until 60 and how much more time I’m going to have to sink in. I ended up taking a 5 day break from WoW and when I came back to it I felt refreshed and more motivated to get the ball rollin’. That’s just me though.
---
Set smaller goals. Everything you do is one less thing you have to do until 60. Instead of “okay I want to hit level 41 today” or whatever, just try to go “alright cool let’s do X number of quests today” and things like that
---
A friend taught me the trick of /who my level to see where other people are leveling. But yeah you should be spamming SM library for that loot/xp.
---
Warrior here, don’t have skinning and I’m probably 20g off mount and I’m 39.5. Are gorillas good without skinning?
---
Don't want to speak for others, but personally I don't really have the time and I'm not sure if I care anymore. 
---
Playing with my mates and my old guildies from back in the day made me realise how a lot of us have moved on and have more important stuff to do. 
---
The saddest part was connecting back with the people who I envied as a kid, that had a job and got to play all day and night when they weren't working. Turns out nearly all of those people are still in the same or similar jobs and haven't progressed in 15 years. Not all people want to progress etc., and I can appreciate that, but that is just not who I am.
---
The "no changes" crowd ruin any oppurtunity for quality changes that only have a posotive impact on the game.
---
ModUI is the addon
---
As I am pretty new to the game what do you mean never again? Is it a one time thing?
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mining](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mining) 
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Smelting](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Smelting) 
---
Look into that. Are you sure you have not unchecked the "Show Available" option in the trainer tab?
---
shhh...we dont talk about fish club....
---
that isn't true at all they have 1/4 the ally pop. Good luck finding groups
---
I am not a multi-billion dollar transnational super company with 15 years of MMO experience and teams of people who’s sole existence is to think about these problems. I didn’t kill the greatest game development company to have ever existed and I don’t force these teams of passionless over worked developers to come up with ways to milk more money out of the player base with micro transactions rather than actually make fun games and solve problems like this.  There’s probably a very good solution to this but I’ve been thinking about how to better include micro transactions into retail rather than solve this one so I’m fresh out of ideas 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I prefer nocast time blind /bleed /poision remove over cast time snare / root removal. Human racial, while its true that some rogue duels are about opening first. i would still prefer blind removal. 
---
Escape artists is good/best for warriors. 
---
Human is only vs rogues / dudu so racial vs 2 out of 9 classes. seems meh to me.
---
NE for rogue free 5 point in talant tree. for rest shitty stealth with 2m cd cant cast in combat  ( i could be wrog here)  cant move. CAN EAT. Kinda ok for rogue / dudu. but also meh (althou i will reroll my dwarf hunter just for this shitty stealth) 
---
Dwarf Racial stone from. removes all those shits +armour % up.  Good for same Warrior / Priest / Hunter / rogue
---
So if we look at not just rogue but overall its safe to say  that dwarf racial is head above other ally racials
---
I think you underestimate the cleave of the AV battle master and the aoe shadowbolt of varimathras lmao, still managed to kill it all with horde pushing on us
---
*Fixed* as a bug (which was im vanilla) allowed having more people in group eithout reducing xp gained for each person beyond the five man group.  Which mean more people = faster clears = xp as if it was a 5man.
---
eh...at a point yes...with like 4 resets of MC gear? not really.  a lot of that shit isn't even good for pvp (or anything), blues are better in half the slots for a lot of classes and they aren't kitted out across the board in any case.  More like they have an entire raid of healers and a bunch of immunity consumables handy.
---
I always found his books a little tough to read. Weird grammar or something idk, but god damn do I love the movie adaptation of no country.
---
That's not my experience. I haven't played with them on classic, but I have played with quite a few of their members on private servers. They're nice if you are competent and/or eager to learn.
---
Thanks so much for that info! That is exactly what I was after. I figured as much with the whole efficiency thing, and is exactly how I'm playing myself.
---
I only plan to run dungeons that have wand upgrade progression personally. Your talent build didn't load properly for me was it deep shadow the whole way? I plan a disc/shadow hybrid until 40. How was healing BRD as Shadow (if you did)? 
---
I take it by not trainig Smite past R2 and HF at all, you did level purely as Shadow? Was your rotation just MB, SWP, Wand? How was MF pre 40ish? I hear just wanding is better if you have a relevant wand?
---
I'm using Zygors guide and addon. It seems to keep you 1 or 2 levels ahead too, doesn't look as fast as Joanna's but seems ok so far.
---
I am leveling Skinning and Tailoring too. Yeah, I only plan to level it as I have the cloth drop. I won't be farming specifically for Tailoring at all. Skinning is just super easy.
---
The gold total seems about on par with my Hunter at 40 (110g), but I also had ammo, food and one less bag slot (and smaller bags) to deal with. Yeah I pretty much intend to grind Gorillas in STV for that level too.
---
Looks like I should be well placed for about the same /played time then, good to know!
---
Come on man. Really?
---
You can't think of any ways that a smaller character model can provide benefits over a larger one?
---
This is awesome, thanks!
---
Just a question - what should be my opener against a warrior and when should I consider fearing?
---
I've actually never in my whole life seen an alliance player try to 1v1 me when my health is full and I'm not fighting a mob. It never happens. They always outnumber you or go at you while you're fighting something.
---
No. In a future phase.
---
First rule of fish club, is bring extra beer for everyone
---
It shows something like 30k characters for the alliance side and a bit over a hundred for the horde.
---
All the other quests he has gives like 10x the amount though lol
---
It’s sinking in
---
Same what nameplates addon gives those combo points.
---
Ret aura definitely generates threat. Plus it's holy damage so accounts for Righteous Fury bonus threat. I forgot to mention I always had Ret Aura up, swapping occasionally for Shadow Res aura when mobs were casting shadow bolts.
---
it's not like you can base your strat for a fight on having it, it's a 1 time use per character ever.
---
This reminds me of a few days ago: 
---
I am a new player to WoW, never touched it before classic came out. 
---
I was running Ragefire for the first time and one of our players had to step away for a few minutes to do some real life stuff...
---
So I was just standing around and I thought, "I wonder how much damage lava does in WoW?" So I dipped my toe in. 
---
"All of it," is the correct answer to that question. 
---
To add insult to injury, our guy came back like 30 seconds after I died, so they had to wait another minute for their healer to walk back....
---
Yeah these things are amazing QoL changes that improved the game in every way. They're only "unpopular" because the #nochanges crowd would be against it as they are manbabies who never had to deal with those things.
---
27 isn’t bad start. Tarren Mill in Hillsbrad should have some quests for you as well
---
If you ain't pulling 3 or more trash at once are you really a tank?
---
Finish Ashenvale quests then move to thousand needles &amp; do Razorfen Kraul dungeon with all its quests
---
I had the hammer in Vanilla. It always felt a bit lackluster and I prefered Quel'serrar later on. The Mandokir sowrd and AQ20 axe might be the overall better choices aswell, but all of them arent in the game yet obviously.
---
Pure threat generation on the other hand - Until BWL nothing will beat that hammer anyway.
---
Yes it was.
---
I've healed every 60 dungeon as a spriest in the past, because I still needed to be able to farm out in the world. Dont see the issue if no one wipes?
---
Awesome! Thank you. I have a really nice setup I built out with Bartender4, WeakAuras and Shadow Frames- but I'm still missing buffs / debuffs around my character portrait. I think ZPerl is the answer! 
---
Maybe I'll just use ElvUI.. the UI quest for perfection continues!
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_lake
---
If your server economy is roughly like mine, then mining has an absolutely terrible return on money and time invested right now. Bars sell barely above vendor price, and the vendor price is a joke. It pretty much only makes sense if you keep the stuff you mine and either use it later to level Blacksmith or Engineering, or sell it once it's worth something in the AH in a few months.
---
There is no completion XP for dungeons. You gain XP for mobs slain, and for quests. From a strict powerleveling perspective, dungeon runs are only superior to questing if you either have a powerful cleave group that can do it very quick, or if you do a quest run with a bunch of quests.
---
PitBull Unit Frames
---
It's the pace of the game including travel time which I like
---
Yea, it never made sense until the Cataclysm expansion put water between Stormwind and Dun Morough.
---
Oh right okay then I will do. I have one for whirlwind back to battle so will change it to defensive. Thanks for the tips
---
For Horde it doesn't really matter much, but it's the animations. Female gnome animations are *puny*. Mot that it mattered much in this deathball, but watching an opponent's animations is an important part of 1v1 pvp
---
If i remember correctly, barkskin should have stopped those interruptions while you healed yourself right? Or is that a talent / older spell?
---
One of the DPS was a shadow priest, the only time I would loose aggro was when he would Mind Blast (+threat ability) in the target not skull. Arguably, a warrior or druid would also loose threat on that target, except they have taunt for such occasions.
---
Paladin is probably better to have in pvp, but shamans are way more fun. You have to be a special kind of pussy to want to play with bubble boys.
---
The proc is not unique 
---
Other weapons and gear pieces have the same proc.
---
Iirc, the tram was planned to go from IF (or SW) to Darnassus at some point. This was scraped, but the Tram map wasn't redone.
---
Where the heck do you learn how to make a runecloth bandy, I'm on 52 and I still just use the single magweave bandages.
---
If you can find a group sure
---
Hmmm im getting ideas now
---
You're literally making shit up to make them seem worse jfc. The stopped streaming around lv53 (they were doing 5mans up until this point), at least their highest level groups when other guilds racing for the first 60 had no idea what to do when brd didn't work out at all.
---
Dustwallow Marsh.  A lot of people say Thousand Needles but I don’t care for it, it’s a huge zone and the quests are too spread out.
---
Also, in case you’re not already doing this, kill literally every last mob you encounter.
---
Thank you for sharing. This is good stuff right here! Have you considered adding Leatrix plus? Could give you some more quality of life enhancements, although looks like you've got an already solid feature set.
---
Nah man. I've been jamming Soil on the regular for the last 15 years. Hella good band. 'Black 7' is lowkey one of my favorote songs!
---
Probably by going 10 man into 5 man dungeons with the no xp penalty bug. That's blizzards fuck up though, not theirs.
---
Orc likes to smash?
---
My wife and I are duoing mages, 75% of our groups 3rd dps is a mage. 
---
3rd mage: blizzard on sheeps.
---
3rd mage: blizzard on one mob pulls.
---
3rd mage: blizzard on no add bosses.
---
As an added "wtf you doin', magebro?"
---
3rd mage: Run in and frost nova while tank is los pulling. Then blizzard.
---
But we have 20k people on those layers.
---
Layers doesnt add more resources to fewer players.
---
To the top
---
Can confirm, am vanilla huntard dad.  XD
---
I pretty much do this other the the swap back to weapons now. I will try it out and see if it works better. 
---
Thanks for the tips I will try it out next run
---
Factions are at WAR. No? When i got camped, I just created alt. and lvling it now when same shit happens.
---
I’ve had a similar experience, in dungeons no real issues as of yet. Just time my drinking to line up when the healer/casters need to. Definitely positive so far.
---
Just finished my artisan quest and got my Big Iron Pole today (lvl 35)! Road to 300 here we go!
---
It made a really great audio book. Lack of punctuation means it was better narrated than read for me.
---
"Real mob health" and "leatrix maps" are what you want. Personally, I find Questie to be an absolute must have, but if you really enjoy the exploring, reading all the quest text and finding things out for yourself I wouldn't recommend it. 
---
You have to be careful with a lot of the guides out there right now as many of them are going to be based on private servers which worked kind of differently in certain ways. Some abilities worked differently, balance was different etc. Basically what worked in a private server might not work the same in classic. A big one that comes to mind which I've seen a lot of talk about is paladins reckoning talent.
---
Yeah I bet Retrograde, Casketmaker, Duped and Aurheim are gonna be pretty upset that this video was uploaded.

it puts the mobs in combat

then no sap

God, that brings me back to when I first played back in like 04 and I was just so enthralled that I walked as far across the Eastern Kingdoms as I could, then got lost and made a new character because I didn't know what the Hearthstone did.
---
Good times.
---
the coordination dude. Having the itens. Everyone alive.. if you cannot understand how hard it is to coordinate people you have never dealt with people in your life. Coordination is not easy.
---
I kinda like the druid healer message i saw the other day, "Most adorable druid healer looking for a wholesome group to yell OOM to" lol
---
May be lowkey more excited for it than PVP haha.
---
Would disenchanting them to sell ok AH be a better option?
---
&gt; Always fight back. You never know how shit the other player might be. 
---
Imagine destroying alliance 1vs1 then the guy go asks for a friend to come gank me. A lvl 55 rogue camping me, just me not the rest of the horde.   
---
I love this game. I'm playing on a pvp server and this lvl 55 guy would gank me every single time I resurrected. My horde? Even though there were about 30+ hordes, they just stood and watch. Shazzrah is a pve carebear horde server.
---
Are they? Then why does this look like a complete lag-fest and anything of similar size on some of the private servers just look way better and more fluid?
---
Don't let the few sully your experience!
---
Didnt know this ! why was it scraped ? any ideas ?
---
I absolutely recommend "Vanas KOS" - Basically this allows you to blacklist people who have stolen from you or trolled groups and things. It also allows you to whitelist people to know they are good. Reputation is a pretty big deal in Classic, so knowing who to avoid because of a bad reputation is worth its weight in gold.
---

If you've not been to Tarren mill in the Hillsbrad foothills, this is a great place to quest. Tonnes of good quests and easy grinding spots all over the place.

Brilliant, thanks a lot. Had a bad experience tanking Uldaman at level 40 once, all my taunts were being resisted toward the end of the dungeon so I'm a little cautious now!!
---
How would you possibly know that only alliance are transferring and not horde? Sure there could be some big alliance guilds leaving and there could also be tons of guildless horde leaving too.
---
the nerf was for raid groups in 5 man dungeons i believe
---
They used light of elune, thats it.
---
thanks for your info!
---
would you recommend I drop mining for some other prophet craft then? perhaps herbalism? my other one is already skinning. also, my server is westfall, but i haven't gotten 'into' the auction house yet there so idk how it is.
---
I understand your point and I was sometimes annoyed because of this while leveling. But then I realised that I was grouping up with strangers a lot more due to this, sometimes even chat a little or decide to do the next quest together as well.
---
I think a lot of these nice QoL changes retail has are good on paper, but might change the game for the worse overall.
---
Still sucks when there's a named you have to kill and it's so crowded that 3 groups form, spamming aoe and waiting 5min+ each.
---
Gonna say mage as well with maybe tailoring and skinning.  You'll get most of your mats off of mobs and you can sell bags for decent gold. And just sell stacks of leather.
---
That's sound advice, appreciate it. I suppose I'll start doing that
---
LoE?
---
That's the point where you switch to an alt or something until they leave.
---
No problem!

Identity theft

Oooh that felt really satisfying

If you gank someone for a day or two you won't be suspended, but if you gank someone 24/7 for months and make the player unable to even play the game you will most likely be warned or temporarily suspended.

I mean, it's not universal.

Most I've seen is Skull first. Cross second. Square CC. Never seen others used so much unless it was some sort of huge pack.

And that's talking since the very beginning of the release of markers.

Well fought, horde scum!
---
I'm not so into the rafting part though
---
Earthmother guide you!
---
Yea, they probably had a barrows deep raid idea or something similar.
---
Darkshore can pretty easily take you to 20 of you do absolutely everything. Then as others said I'd make your way to Stormwind and start questing in Westfall. This is kind of a long journey that takes you across to the other continent and through some higher level zones so if you've never done it before make sure you consult a map.
---
Felt this same way! 40 was a big milestone, to get the mount and them what?!?! I took a few days off after I got the mount, and it helped a lot.  
---
Now back, and pushing for 50 (currently 48). Might take a wee break at 50 also, maybe even the weekend....so ok for the final push to 60 :D

---
People not getting this reference 😭
---
I dinged 60 a couple of days before BC came out, so I never got the experience "raiding".
---
Can someone sort of explain to me the prep and progress of raiding at 60?
---
I see people talking about pre-raid gear, and stuff like that. 
---
My main is a Warrior so I'd assume at level 60 I re-spec to Protection? Tank 5 man raids, then 10 man? Is there need for more then 1 tank at level 60?
---
Could I be spected Protection but still DPS in raids if need be?
---
Really? Never noticed that.
---
Honestly they should just go play eve online lol, their style of gameplay is so much better suited there
---
The strategy I used to find him was to wait on top of the hill right next to the graveyard and cast eagle eye by each of the 3 spawn points, then using the macro
---
&gt;tar broken tooth
---
&gt;tm8 
---
Which targets him and marks him with a skull. Granted I got really lucky and found him at the 2nd spawn point I checked this way
---
As a healer: how? I can not find a way to show pet health as a priest.  Turning name tags on makes everything a mess (impossible to click)
---
I healed with shadow spec until 58 so its no problem at all in dungeons :)
---
But when you really only play together nothing speaks against a pure heal spec, you have a way easier time with you mana management if you do so.
---
By owning hard in the start it demoralizes the enemy to get 100+ people to sit and wait for them in blackrockmountain. So in the long run it's probably worth it.
---
also, it could be that the healer is not specced for healing. Most healing trees have % threat reduction from spells. 
---
They either need to learn to downrank their spells, or you were taking too much damage that they had to spam the big heals.
---
From 10-40, you really dont need to spec holy even for dungeons. Shadow will probably speed things up for your average players.
---
However, depending on the skill level of your team mates you might want to go ahead and build holy.
---
Doing dungeons is pretty much the fastest and most consistent xp. If you have a warrior thats good at holding aggro and a
---
Thousand needless is perfect.
---
I would also go with garrote + bleeds on an Orc, but different situations and playstyle vary.  That's what makes rogues fun.
---
I've tanked strat ud with a ret spec and not even any tank gear at all (3.5k hp unbuffed and 6.2k armor) and it was no problem. I held aggro most of the time. No aggro problems at all with bosses or aoe packs and also no real danger to my health except on baron rivendare.
---
Are there any addons which show both the vendor price for an item as well as the approximate AH price?
---
PvE
---
I was hoping for a /wave but the salute was even better!
---
From a fellow undead rogue on Kromkrush I appreciate the video! Very nice. 
---
Also what add-on do you use for that sweet combat text?
---
We're talking about difficulty so we must look at other people success. I mean if dungeons were a cake walk for me and I saw people telling how hard it is, I would conclude that I'm super skilled. But the the fact is many people is having the same experience so I can conclude it's easy.
---
Thing that was considered difficult back in the days are the norm today so there's no escaping the fact that the game is significantly easier for almost everyone.
---
One use per character.
---
I will fight for you.
---
Hillsbrad + thousand needles. Also, don't feel bad about greens. Completing them will unlock yellows + it's faster to complete greens rather than orange and yellows.
---
Yeah its not luck. you know ur stuff and where going for it. Good job mate. And im here chilling running everywhere coz at lvl 43 i have 35 gold..
---
I'm Runecloth Baga! You fuck wit me, you fuckin wit da best!
---
The bars should pick up in value starting at iron and especially at mithril.
---
I really recommend just making the run to Stormwind. You will run out of quests to reliably do. The closest dungeon you can do if you don't want to make the run is BFD in northern Ashenvale. 
---
The quests give absolutely massive amounts of xp but generally questing will be more optimal. Dungeons do give good rewards (if they drop and you win) so can be worthwhile either way so you aren't undergeared. Xp is given through the amount of mobs.
---
Yeah you can skin just about everything in STv and Desolace at 225. You’re good to go
---
Ah I have TitanPanel already.  Does Bagon track items across characters?  Last time I used it was during Cataclysm.
---
Can you ride epics from other races?
---
You need to put the warrior into combat before he charges.  DoT from max range is advised.  He'll need to burn another cooldown to get up in your face.  Keep hot and shield up (obvious).  If its a fury warrior, its not too bad since theyll be mainly hack and slashing you in beserker stance the entire time.  Arms warriors are more than likely going to be spamming MS on you.  Shield is your #1 go to since its absorbtion isnt effected by MS.   You will want to fear early in the match so the warrior will have to burn beserker rage to get out of it.  Worrying about a pummel is your biggest concern.  If you do get pummeled on a heal, you have shield, fear, MC, and a few other abilities to use to give you time to recover from the spell lock.  If they kick you during shadow casting, you should be healing at that point to ride it out.  Most of the damage youll do to them is through DoTs since a geared warrior can lay down some hurt.  
---
This is generally written, because no matter the spec I have, I tend to do the exact same regardless of disc holy or shadow spec.  Getting distance wont be possible due to hamstring, charge abilities.  If theyre not too bright, if they beserker rage without being feared, wait til it wears off them fear them.  This mistake is costly to warriors.

The shadoweave is super powerful when combined with a drain tanking spec. Level 38 is when the spec takes off - I respecced at 38 and haven't looked back.

Fairbanks?!?

More like ~15 minutes.

&gt; I don't think they used LoE here,

Isn't that exactly what's happening at 5:10 in the video?

Stream and/or raid schedule.
---
lmao i rolled horde to play with friends. I couldn't give a damn called down. Reddit is a fucking circle jerk
---
Apes like ally because they are one of the few guilds out there who does the gnome/dwarf race choice and that makes them look unique.
---
Nah jk, ally just is stronger faction for all the stuff they like doing.
---
Please don't leave. As part of Skeram's master faction, I fear for our 3 hour battleground queues.
---
Circular saws rotate in the direction the teeth bite, which is counterclockwise here.
---
Good on you man, but seriously they should 100% ban auction addons. People like me who use completely zero addons get fucked because we play the game the way it was designed.
---
\&gt; S P E L L C L E A V E
---
I just remembered this is a thing. I played classic at launch and this would happen sometimes and people will complain in under city chat and we would tell them what happened￼!
---
Aye, it is indeed Light of Elune (the Alliance-only quest reward to make you immune to damage and spells for 10 seconds). Sorry for not being more clear.
---
I don't think you should of rolled for it. It's like someone telling you there car broke down, you offer them a ride to work and when you get there ask them to pay you.
---
Typically the person reserving is forming the group though, which is doing something beyond what the rest of the group is doing. So long as it's abundantly clear at the start which gives others an opportunity to leave without getting blindsided by a reservation I think it's fine, without any additional conditions. 
---
If you don't like it, don't join that group or make your own just like the person trying to reserve the item.
---
No its not because this isnt a Kindergarten Like  ffx
---
gotcha thx
---
They leave you alone until the lowest level in their group runs up to you and attacks, then after you defend yourself they swarm on you like you are the asshole and initiated it.
---
Gonna have to look into it.  I've been using ElvUI for my bag interface as it was clean but it has been quite awhile since I used Bagnon which was back in Cataclysm.
---
I'm wondering if it would save time/money to fly to SW, take the tram to IF, then continue your flight somewhere else.
---
What is TSM  ? only TSM is LOL team
---
No problem.  Another thing to consider, don’t do orange quests ever unless you specifically want the reward, the effort vs. XP just isn’t worth it.
---
This may shock you, but it is possible to store pieces of armour and weapons that you're not wearing in your bags or in your bank. And then you can switch those items around whenever you are not in combat.
---
Most of the tanks fall on two ends of the spectrum
---
1.) if you pull off me, you tank that one
---
2.) I must hold everything no matter what and chase shit down
---
Then you get level headed tanks that know they should be actively trying to hold everything but not to panic if they lose a mob.  If the whole team understands that threat is a completely different beast in classic, it makes things smoother.  If you’re ranges and you pulled threat, bring it back to the tanks melee range.
---
And seriously, shadow priests dump too much threat.  I don’t want to burn crowd pummeler charges in 5 man dungeons just to bring a shadow priest.
---
Yeah let’s reintroduce the mistakes that made a rerelease of classic relevant in the first place. Smart.
---
Green quests are best quests. You can take out enemies faster and get the turn in sooner
---
Was also gonna say badlands. I would check out the camp of dark iron dwarfs just south of ulda, they are all on an incline. I’d mix that in with some buzzard camps and whatever else you can pull across BLs. Also, I’m sure you know, but counterspell is great for pulling mobs.
---
What server did you play on and what are you on now?
---
Was the healer also throwing some dps? Moonfire wrath all that jazz? I find when I’m healing and doing some dps it increases aggro a bit. Also the pre-pull hot isn’t a good idea I’ve found its better to let the tank take some damage usually 25-50% and then throw a big heal, hot up and back off for a bit. Also if the dps is taking aggro away and they need to be healed it messes with threat. I recommend a threat bar to everyone in the group so they know when to ease up a bit. It might be too much to ask for though.
---
This is disgusting.
---
Gehennas player here: Apes is NOT part of the mafia here on classic. They are farming lots of devilsaurs but no collusion at all. And yes there is a mafia, it is NOT bannable as of yet, blizzard has not taken an official stance whether or not it is allowed(I sent in a ticket).
---
Also yes apes has previously done mafia stuff, hell they basically invented it, but that's in the past.
---
How can they even reliably hit you?
---
Good Luck.
---
Yeah, you can check characters and I'm pretty sure their banks as well.
---
UNTIL NOW I JUST NOTICED THE NARRATOR VOICE OF THE INTRO IS SYLVANAS !!!
---
Check the ah on your server. I vendored everything up until thick leather, but now the player base is concentrated more towards level 40-60 you might find that the other leathers aren’t so over farmed and devalued on the ah as they were a couple of weeks ago when everybody was levelling. 
---
Sunder does increase damage but it’s main point is that it produces a lot of agro so it is an excellent tool for tanking.
---
I got a couple questions: Does your ret spec include Consecration? Were you using 1H + shield? Did you have to use Seal of Wisdom often or just SoR and drinking between pulls?
---
&lt;3
---
While Maitoz does a great job leading, more needs to be said of the players being able to calmly follow instructions and keep comms relatively clear
---
I was told this didn't happen. It's the constant bullshit you hear "doesn't happen" that ALWAYS happens, and it's ALWAYS mages. Charging 1g for 40 water? Fuck you. I'm done inviting mages.
---
The best part is when they use blizzard on a single pull.
---
Aw man. Right in the feels.
---
Yeah the sense of community is awesome and definitely something that's missing from retail.
---
Continue to deliberately misunderstand people if you want, but you'll condemn yourself to a life of constant conflict with those around you.
---
Aye, I agree on the mobs part, but if it is a generally contested area I will usually use Ice Armor in case I get jumped by physical classes. If the coast is clear I'm definitely rocking Mage Armor whenever feasible.
---
I was a 5-man-oholic through beta, vanilla and TBC all those years ago.
---
Generating high threat on one mob and "keep-them-off-the-healer-threat" on 4\~6 mobs is entirely possible, even for warriors with the worst multi-target tools.
---
The old way of doing it has a fine rationale.
---
Pull with 4 elites. You CC one, in order to reduce the amount of mobs that needs to be controlled - as well as to reduce the amount of damage the healer has to keep up with.
---
You then damage focus one mob. This allows the tank to "only" need to build high threat on one mob, and low threat on the others initially. This fits perfectly with warrior and druid tanking tools in vanilla. Also; damage focus means you reduce the number of mobs quicker, which again reduces drain on healer mana pool.
---
This is safe, efficient and honestly also **fast** as long as everybody knows what they're doing. Downtime is minimal, deaths and wipes are highly unlikely.
---
Are AOE comps (spellcleave and melee moshpit) also viable? sure. But you really shouldn't advertise for a tank for those groups, since a tank in said groups is dead weight. If you're planning to CC chain mobs, there's no point having a zero-damage sponge standing there taking damage from CCed mobs - you could have more damage and another set of crowd control cooldowns instead.
---
it works if you are keyboard turner. I guess the person has turn right on D so he runs in circles
---
What is dead may never die.
---
Edgemaster gloves? Sounds like some 18+ item for men. 😂
---
Pls send to me as well
---
Allies get it in Stormgarde.
---
I believe Elvui tracks it too. I was using it in retail but I'm playing classic in windowed mode, minimised. Elvui messes the whole secreen when you re-adjust it. I've stopped using it and switched to bartender + titanpanel.
---
Awhh Classic horde playing with their feet....
---
I wouldn't bet particularly high on them getting world first on a new boss anyway. They're all very good, but world first on a brand new boss is a different beast than getting the first kill on Ragnaros for the upteenth time.
---
&gt;just got the ~~sluttiest~~ best plate chest drop

There so many more features in this lovely addon.. so I really hope they port it to Classic..

Honestly it's just my font changes. I can upload my Fonts folder when I get home.
---
I camped a 60 warlock who was killing lowbies in arathi the other day. I don't normally camp people too long. I killed this guy 3 or 4 times, he was terrible and it was boring, so I went back to leveling my mining. Then I run into him not more than 10 minutes later and hes killing lowbies from my guild! The nerve! I got my campfire ready after that!
---
I have no respect for max lvls who gank lowbies. Players like that only do it because they cant kill players their level. If I'm leveling an alt and someone  higher level comes and kills me, you better believe I'm hopping on my main and hunting them down!
---
Keep up the good work!
---
That is indeed a dick move.

[Fade](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10942/fade#comments)
---
You can skin beasts up to 1/5 of your skinning level, so with 225 you can skin all beasts up to level 45, including.
---
I’d say, for what you’re asking, a second monitor with classic wowhead would be your best bet. TSM does show AH price in your inventory so you’d be able to tell if that gray item is worth money, then clearly it’s used for something!
---
Question: If you have ret aura up, and a party member gets hit and the ret aura does damage, does the threat from that go to them or you?
---
I'm assuming it goes to them, though wishing for the opposite.
---
You’ve either got to buy it or find a nice mage that will make some for a tip.  Water is mega expensive at higher levels so if you can befriend a mage that will give you a stack or two every time you are on you can throw him a g or two every now and then and still save a fortune.
---
Wait in wow did this lose its meaning? I stopped a long time ago...this was common knowledge back then lol
---
There is a huge overlap on Rogue and Warrior BiS gear. Just saying.
---
Pepperidge farm remembers
---
You need to get bis (best in slot gear) pre raid (5 mans+10mans) so you would be farming brd and lower and upper spire for your gear. You should probably go fury spec for dps since you dont know the encounters unless you have a guild which will let you tank. You need consumables for raiding and sone guilds even let lvl 58s into mc and oxy lair.
---
Auctionator shows vendor prices, and AH prices after you scan with it.
---
It's almost as if playing classic for years already gave them an advantage
---
We were spamming SM and the Triune Amulet drops. I had it already and given that many players don't have a neckpiece at all by this level, a few players rolled on it. Including a mage and a paladin. 
---
The paladin wins. The mage proceeds to go into a rage in party chat about how the paladin is a ninja looter and is just going to vendor it. Also proceeds to explain how it is a mage only item (I'm a priest already wearing it). Then threatens to report us all for theft and leaves the group.
---
Paladin has to leave later on for unrelated reasons, but we pick up a warrior to tank. Mage is replaced with a hunter. The 2H mace drops at the end of Cath. Warrior hasn't completed the various warrior quests and has trash gear, so he asks if he can take the 2H mace. I say sure. Hunter goes into the exact same rage about how the warrior is just a ninja looter and that the mace is a paladin only item. 
---
I honestly sat there wondering if the mage had logged off and gotten on his alt hunter.
---
the armor ratings on this one must be off the charts

---
Have the Sunken Temple class quests (lvl 50 quests) been omitted from the game?
---
The mobs will only go straight through the healer if the healer does anything to generate threat.   
---
If you cast Battle Shout, and we assume you're max level, and you hit only yourself and you're in combat with 3 mobs, you will do 35 threat on each of those mobs. That's basically enough to hold aggro vs a heal of 210 (calculated as 35 \* 3 enemies \* 2 for the health - threat formula). Three battle shouts and you're safe vs a heal of 630.  
---
Three sunders and you will hold aggro until you're healed 1560.
---
1v1 yes, but in the context of a bg I'd say removing poison is a strpng contender fpr being better.
---
yesterday eventing i saw 2 players just sitting on a fence, both from the same guild, Kaltu verata Nektu or something like that. and we just chatted for a few minutes about that reference and that they never let a dude named Ash get that damn book. 
---
It's this random stuff what makes classic so totaly different, the ppl you meet, you will meet again at some point in time, they arn't just some other ppl from what server i don't care about, that just are there. that's what retail has lost for me. i encounter ppl but interaction is none, i can do what ever i want in retail but it feels shallow now.
---
after nearly 1 month of classic, i just logged into retail once!
---
maybe if these aoe mages realised that they want a consecration paladin tank and not a warrior... there would be less salt about AoE comps. you need an AoE tank to tank your AoE.  
---
with my pally mate i can flamestrike blizzard all day and not pull aggro if i just wait for a couple conc ticks. but if im rolling with a warrior tank i have to be infinitely more careful and use single target spells... and the whole run takes alot longer.  
---
and it's not fucking spellcleave guys. **cleave** is in an arc infront/around your character and a subclass of more general **aoe** which is an area that can be placed anywhere and almost always a full circle.
---
tsm has automated sniping? seems game breaking

I know,900 gold for the epic mount will be really hard to get

Go Kill fire exiles in Arathi Highlands 2-5am and you’ll be close to mount. I was making 1O-15G hour there at lvl 38-4O

Nah man. Its more like someones car broke down, you offer them a ride to work and when you get there you say gas bill 50/50? And they respond "lol no" and get out of the car.

There are a few ways to get through the Grim Guzzler.
---
The easiest way is to get Private Rocknot drunk, either by buying ten suds from the bartender or stealing them (Will anger the patrons though). This will activate the Phalanx golem boss.
---
A Rogue can pickpocket the key and pass that way.
---
You start a brawl and kill a certain amount of patrons in the bar so a guard detachment will come and open the door to check in.
---
Or you can do the quest for Mistress Nagmara that has you go outside the instance to collect items.
---
It was designed to have addons, you're just not taking advantage of it.
---
Nope moving in the game world still isnt enough.  you can be on follow and go afk.  You have to actually be sending new commands to the server.
---
I'm loving these 😂
---
No, but it allows you to layer-hop and have the resources literarily repsawn in front of you every 10 seconds or so. Well, used to anyway.
---
Uh not that I know of and if it does I don’t use it I use auctioneer and go through every category in ah and a few pages filtering by %
---
Where did your first 10 points in the Holy tree go? I suspect Divine Intellect but after that...? It's either Imp SoR, which is useless if you're not gonna use it (maybe for soloing?), Divine Strength or Spiritual Focus.
---
while leveling and healing dungeons my pug mates made sure i got a last hit once in a while to proc spirit tap...
---
There is no honor in this
---
Use whatever weapon you can find that has highest DPS
---
I just want summoning stones. They could just make summoning core and give warlocks teleports to cities. EZPZ
---
You act like women don't wear short shorts. I see plenty of women walking down the street where you can see the bottom of their ass sticking out. So how is a representation of an actual article of clothing worn by women in the real world sexist?
---
I'd forgo shadowbolt post level 5 in favor of a wand to be honest. Bolting past that is crazy mana inefficient and will slow you down a ton. Even pre-5 i found just autoattacking with whatever weapon i had at the time(skinning knife at 2.2dps is super good at that level) with the imp much better than bolting.
---
im hyped
---
Cant you just wait to loot the corpse until everyone goes away?
---
Stop playing with noobs. Masters of the Arcana know that Arcane Explosion has a much higher dps.
---
Yea you just make a folder named Fonts and you have to rename your fonts to the default names. So in-game you might be selecting in addons "Arial" but really its your font you put in the folder named Arial. If that makes sense, its early &amp; drinking coffee lol
---
There’s really only 2 mandatory talents and they’re wands in disc and spirit tap in the shadow tree. Luckily those are both in the first tier. After that you can go shadow if you want or you can pick whatever. Personally I’ve enjoyed leveling holy cause the dot and wand shadow spec was boring to me and it makes dungeon grinding a little easier on me. The point is do what you want and have fun. Just get improved wands and spirit tap first.
---
Yeah, it does. It functions on top, and a totally separate source of mana, in a vacuum. It does not increase your regular mana gains from spirit ticks. It only gives you exactly what the totem says. Therefore it takes 20s to break even, because the totem and regular do not affect each other.
---
Yup. Was great.
---
Doing a Strat Runs maybe gets you 20g. I had like 300g when I reached 60. Now I have 1200 but I bought lots of stuff to resell later like pvp-rares, golden pearls and crap like that.
---
i tried to find a place where the lightning was at least decent, but it was difficult, in everlook
---
I think 6,2k armor are only possible with shield if we exclude consumables.
---
What is the highest level dungeon a Prot Warrior can solo grind with some damage on hit gear and engineering?
---
And, what class is a good pairing with a Prot Warrior for 2-manning a harder dungeon efficiently - and which dungeon?
---
I play on a server that is 66% alliance, abuot the same as Skeram except the other way. Except you only hear ally on Skeram bitching and not us. Waaah.
---
&gt;nobody wants to see some kind of weird slutty ~~baby woman with dwarfism~~ baby. 
---
You underestimate the porn industry here....
---
Ignore list is also pretty small
---
I'll agree with this, the biggest pain in HoT was falling off the map :)
---
I plugged in my info and it gives me 8 quests in a zone, then step 9 is grind to the next level.  I would be interested to see how far those 8 quests take me and how much I would have to grind.  I only bring it up because Zygor’s guide has done the same thing to me a few times and it was 75% of a level.  I found that funny and not very helpful.
---
Pvp raid leaders are essentially just FC. Same skillset required, and skilled members who communicate effectively make it so much stronger
---
I didnt claim it was good or bad, you claimed it was ruined so i wanted to know in what way.
---
Modui
---
I have the same problem except my server is 66% Ally, yet there are no post about it on this subreddit, this is the 5th post about Skeram I've seen thus far.
---
Oh didn’t know, weird blizz gave me the option without informing me. Thanks for the heads up!
---
I'm a lvl 36 undead priest that has aspirations of casual raiding (20 mans, MC/BWL) and PvP battlegrounds at lvl 60. I would also like the option to be able to solo grind for gold at 60 for 100% mount and truefaith vestment mats.
---
I have been trying to put a Disc build together that will act as a sort of healing/holy damage hybrid. Has anyone ever tried this out before?
---
It is likely that i'll be PvPing more than raiding (once i've got majority of bis for heals/damage sets). I don't want to get caught in a 1v1 scenario as pure heal spec where all i can do it run and try to out heal until the cavalry arrives.
---
The 2 build links below are roughly what I've been thinking with a few points that im torn on. Any thoughts?

Inspiration or blessed recovery?? - leaning towards inspiration
---
I haven't done exact math but from my experience while leveling (which is pretty fresh now obviously) it is roughly the same. Not using Renew might be slightly better.
---
However, I have also tanked and healed in progress guilds and as such I must say that a HoT and extended "topped-off time" makes the tank and group feel saver. That is also important in a run, even in the shitshow that is classic wow leveling. You tell your tank that he doesn't need cooldowns yet, can pull quicker etc. That is worth a lot of time for you as well (since your runs will be shorter and tanks will like to go out with you more).
---
I have been farming devilsaurs to buy my epic mount. What surprised me is the quality of wPvP to be found. Un'goro is almost like a BG with the devilsaurs as PvP objectives.
---
It's worth it if you're gonna be standing still for 30s+, but otherwise you're better just throwing a heal of your own and moving own.
---
Bit different if it's a spellcleave group tho, it does become easily efficient when the entire party benefits.
---
OP is probably used to private server meta where people use world buffs like MC is Naxx.  They're nice to have, but I don't remember really caring much through the first part of AQ. We got them if people had time, but they are not needed in MC whatsoever.
---
Dont know man, i get up at 6am and get back at 5pm and still have my epic mount.
---
&gt; nobody wants to see some kind of weird slutty baby
---
I see you aren't familiar with weebos.
---
This is probably the issue.
---
how did u make the first 1k for epic? im a herber too
---
herb skin on a rogue
---
Also collision boxes. There's actual sections of the game where a gnome can fit through and not any other races
---
You're welcome, you'll find something that works for you
---
&gt; forming the group though, which is doing something beyond what the rest of the group is doing
---
If they are a DPS only player, not really. There is an endless spam of groups "LF2M tank and healer" on my server because healers are hard to come by and I swear only 3 tanks are allowed to be online at the same time. If you're a tank you can pretty much log on and join whatever group you want in under 30 seconds.
---
I'm not entirely sure what you just said but I love your enthusiasm!
---
I know I capped my list in Vanilla, not sure if the cap carried over or not.
---
I’m holding 25 or so twink items. Why do u think that’s going to make raw mats increase in price? Less supply due to layer hoping? I’d like to hear u opinion. Nothing stated I’m holding this for long term. Im level 51, within 1-2 week I’ll be 6O and burn 2Kg just for epic mount, devilsaur set and 1-2 BOE BiS. 2K is not that much gold.
---
u must be checking AH really really often then
---
This is a SLAP IN THE FACE, come on Blizz, come down off your giant pile of subscription cash and fix gamebreaking garbage like this OR I'M UNSUBBING RIGHT NAO!!!
---
I'm a level 35 priest and I would argue you could do the same with shadow spec.
---
Don´t rush to 60 that quickly. :)

After years of path of exile trading... This is nothing!

If he’s on a PVP server I can’t believe he stayed in Ashenvale.  It’s not as bad as STV but it’s still a gank shitshow.
---
"letting me"
---
Safe to assume? Sure. Everyone can hope for 55-45 or even 60-40. Skeram a week after launch was 70-30 H/A. It's only gotten worse now, that's when the actual gameplay for Alliance starts getting impacted as you can expect to never be able to do things like kill world bosses.
---
That's true, but if it's a classic+ boss, then their competition will be whichever guilds managed to stay active enough to get full Naxx gear for everyone. Even if a guild like Method wanted to compete in that race, they'd have to first spend many months clearing old content to catch up. They'd have to announce classic+ at least a year in advance to give retail world first racers a chance to switch over.
---
But gnomes can't be druids :c
---
Yes, this far and the mages I've encountered, fuck mages. If I have a group I put them at the bottom of the invite list. I feel bad for the mages who are likely good people, I'm sure there is a majority of them but the assholes ruin it.
---
ONE OF US
---
cool guide, thanks! Got a level 1 troll hunter parked until my wife caves and plays with me
---
But i want to RP Rexxar.
---
You’d be surprised how often people rip themselves off. Tbh u can make decent gold buying stuff on ah selling for less then vendor price. Am just to lazy to make the runs.
---
Exactly this. To me, gear that would normally look ugly ends up looking badass if I can recognize it as a difficult piece of gear to obtain.
---
same for horde. you guys seem peacefull when meeting in the wild, but as soon as 3+ Horde members are within 60 yd range. you all pop your secret racial.
---
i swear it's muscle memory for some of them:
---
run up, nova, cone of cold, blink away, blizzard
---
they do this whether there's 1 mob or 100
---
I guess the issue of layering muddies the waters. On the layers I usually play, there's APES, SALAD BAKERS and BIZZNO everywhere, and the horde does nothing.
---
Not sure why tbh
---
FAAAAT ASSES
---
Ya, we have a 66% ally ratio to horde. We get our ass kicked about as much as Ally on Skeram, except we don't post on the subreddit about it 4-5 times a day. Maybe just don't suck so bad?
---
Take up weed smoking. 
---
Makes slow, tedious tasks fun!
---
nova + cone of cold shatter is the highest DMG output spell a mage has and it's a frontal cleave. 
---
Warriors aren't supposed to tank the pack, just taunt stragglers and kick spellcasters to keep mobs clumped.
---
That was beautiful
---
I have same issue with the Chief as a druid.
---
WSG flag running, druids especially since they can toss a HoT up to offset some of the loss and then go cat and pop the off-hand.
---
Yea I am addicted. It's too much fun
---
I totally aggree! Best thing ever Since Classic i played
---
While it's good to know they have that option, I think it's asking too much for a healer to do that. They shouldn't have to.
---
Pretty much honestly.
---
Mages are fair and balanced.
---
Fantastic method right here
---
As a tank every time ive had to stop the group to bitch at some one its always a hunter. Why do you guys force me to do this? 
---
Last dungeon i ran the hunter always had to have his own target. He never attacked the same target as me and the rest of the group. That or im battling a pet for aggro.
---
I had another run where a hunter constantly went after the sheep'd target. Fuck sakes why
---
Thank you for listening to my venting
---
-angry warrior tank
---
It’s incredible how many stories there are like this. 
---
My best friend growing up passed away almost 2 years ago this October. He gave me his install disks for WoW one weekend that would last us on a 10+ years journey playing together. From local after school sessions to across the country while we were in college. 
---
Named my char after his and have been doing the same everything he introduced me to back in 2007. Also am getting one of those 3D printed status of his toon for my desk. 
---
This game creates memories like no other, man.
---
pvp build for druid: dont.
---
reroll a class that doesnt suck
---
I was gonna ask.
---
We don't get killed as much, because we're not awful like ya'll are. But Skeram and my realm do indeed have similar population imbalances.

The old WOTLK first patch Hunter Volley. So strong that you might as well just use it the whole dungeon.

---
Nah people just love to complain about anything and everything. I’ve yet to encounter a dps who doesn’t know that a skull means to focus all dps on that one first. 
---
A lot of (not all) Tanks / Healers have serious resentment towards DPS and also somewhat of a superiority complex it seems. They need to be taken down a peg or two sometimes.
---
Yes your roles are equally as important as every else’s. Yes there are fewer of you in the game as there are DPS. However your job is not super hard and special - it’s a team game.
---
/thread
---
Kind of was though and I'm not trying to be a loothound at all. I'm actually really nice to people in the run. I just stated it sucks looks rolls all the time. Try to understand before you comment.
---
I was a bit ahead of the pack so I exploited that a bit (sold roughly 15 green lens of shadow &amp; frost for 30-60g each), plus I got an Edgemasters I sold early on for 600g.
---
At the moment I think mining and farming essences are the biggest moneymakers, but if you can afford to sit on herbs by phase 3 you'll be loaded.
---
If you can get 4 essence of waters an hour that's &gt;60g an hour on my server.
---
I just went from ratchet to astranaar on my warlock the other night..
---
Is there a way to mark skull and x into a macro, or into one button? Let me know!
---
I like this. Fortunately most healers I've run with will take my advice. If they don't, though, this will be valuable.
---
So, in this situation would it not be okay to to ignore him and just roll on it anyway? If I was in a group of randos from chat and I'm told an item is on reserve last minute, I'm pretty sure I'd just choose to ignore them and roll on it anyway, maybe even roll Need on it just to be spiteful.
---
No they didn't add chocobos until Burning Crusade.
---
Sicher, jeglicher humoristischer content bezüglich WoW ist von Barlow xD
---
On the APES run to MC video how did the view get zoomed out that far?
---
the dwarf has a /silly where he wipes out his erection.

"*clothes ripping noise*, 'oh im having a wardrobe malfunction'  *spring noise* 'Oh theres me hammer'"
---
There is one downside with Thornes never buff it on your healers, speaking from experience here\^\^
---
I dont mind blizzard being called out, they should, i just downvote retarded opinions. Like do you honestly believe that if they ran this on 1.12 client that there'd be less lag? It would probably outright disconnect you due to the amount of inputs at once
---
Reported for wasting people’s time, if only this was a thing, amirite
---
Classic really nails the "grind". It asks so much of the player, but continually rewards you in a way that keeps you engaged. There's always something you can "should" be doing but there's so much more you "could" be doing and regardless of what you choose, the experience is rewarding. 
---
I quit retail because things became too linear and the social aspects became heavily silo'd and isolated. Some of the best experiences in Classic happen "moment to moment" whereas retail felt completely flat and meaningless until you are able to do Mythic Raids.
---
I didn't know they could do Mara as well. Thank you!
---
This is important. You ban the account that's doing it and, boom, there will be another account. You find thier methods, and you can eliminate some automatically, or at least have it flagged for review automatically.
---
im like 99.999% sure your vanish gets used but it doesn't break the root as I said in the other comment. (I remember watching some video/stream while the beta was active and a rogue was dueling a druid)
---
im not talking about lvl 60 here. but levelling through dungeon farm.
---
idk, it's seriously effective *thus far*. i'll let you know when it fails. pally really falls off sadly.
---
Right in topic
---
Lmao, paladins.
---
It’s not much, but it’s honest work.
---
preach
---
Well, you have us buddy
---
No raiding unless you have an epic mount. Lol
---
Dude this is super helpful, thanks!
---
&gt;Open these areas and take Classic in a different direction from retail.
---
Most, if not all the original devs from classical WoW are gone. Continuing from 1.12 is a pipe dream, and even if they tried, it wouldn't have the same creative direction that made WoW what it was.
---
I will speak with the druid in question. Normally pre-hots have only been an issue on aoe pulls, so I haven't bothered. But this was also the first time I didn't 2H dps tanked a dungeon, so my threat wasn't as impressive as it normally is.
---
Aren't they daisy dukes?  Thus the joke.  I thought hot pants were longer than daisy dukes.
---
Check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8c0t4b/cutunfinished_content/) out ;)
---
You are making a huge deal over 400g chocolate, something either someone ignorant or elderly would bother themselves with.
---
I just hit 40, 2 days ago, taking a break till the weekend and I'll be back into the glorious grind 😀
---
But doesn't slow them, making kiting them a chore.
---
You need both.
---
I was playing with a guild mate who ninja'd that mace from a warrior.  It vendors for like 2.5G, which in the late 30's isn't anything to scoff at.  A warrior can easily have access to a much better weapon.  Yeah, the quest is kind of a pain in the ass, but it should be your #1 priority as soon as you have access to it.  The rogue won, the tank got upset and left.  I'm kind of indifferent to the whole scenario.  I'm not sure rewarding a warrior with a free 2G for not completing a quest is the correct call.  The war was also tanking with a dagger, so he didn't really have much of an idea about the game.  IDK.
---
Not just a big idiot and mixed up the bosses. It's Magistrate Barthilas i was talking about, he drops the Peacemaker
---
Thousand Needles is also captured really well.
---
They are definitely organised but i'd hate being in the same room with them
---
At 60 it's not that hard if you have still some quest areas left you could do. I got my epic mount 6 rl days after I hit 60, at that time I already had about 600g.
---
Exactly , so even though you can go in the chat settings and toggle orcish language, you want another language that other than all the ones blizzard took time to put in game..
---
It's Spy
---
&gt; Unpopular opinion on this subreddit : it is nostalgia.
---
Maybe for some people, but vanilla WoW is still a highly competent MMO. I have a buddy who is a stickler for MMOs and seems to highly value quality of life features and modern innovations that the genre's made in the last decade. He decided to play Classic, his first time ever playing WoW, and he's having so much fun that he even suckered his girlfriend into playing. 
---
The game still holds up.
---
Sadly all my friends are set on playing classic, so that's what I have to play atm.
---
But I do hope they get bored soon
---
Who would win:
---
All powerful mage with the ability to teleport around the world and blink of of stunts
---
Or
---
1 little pixel boi on the ground,, usually a broken fence post thatd 6 inches off the he ground.
---
ESO is kind've a joke, not to step on any fans toes, but I mean the majority of the game is so easy, it makes playing with friends in the open world useless even though the scaling in theory makes it easy to play with friends at any level, but in reality if 1 person can steamroll any open world mob, then a group of friends are pretty much just playing a running/quest turn in simulator. 
---
Not to mention the fact that there's hardly anything to earn in game and that the most interesting things that you would be willing to grind for are only attainable through lootboxes.
---
Thank you for clarifying for the clueless.
---
Ohh thought they were gnomes and dwarfs.
---
Once alliance always alliance ?
---
It's Classic, not retail. It's never going to "feel fresh" constantly.
---
This is what you signed up for. A never-ending flatline at 60 with no new content to chew into. Ever.
---
Welcome to stagnation. Welcome to Classic.
---
Because theres up to 15000 people on private servers and not millions
---
Some people do all the other things available to be done instead of JUST level.
---
Also, sitting online without playing also could be a thing if you were trying to deal with not getting put back in a queue
---
Afaik it would give you the message "Your corpse is not in this instance"
---
One CritCone and a few AE and you don't need to kite them because it is dead.
---
But realistically, you don't need to hit with your ranged weapon as a warrior anyway.
---
I did have a gorilla in Uldaman that got more of my healing than the mediocre tank. Those rock dwarves, man, you chuck a renew on and they come straight for you, but ol’ Magilla grabbed them up easy.
---
I wasn’t trying to say you want to swap, I was just saying you can. And there are actually a couple of videos out there and I’ve seen people here on reddit say as well that since you can’t earth bind kite in live the same way you could on private servers that 1h shield actually speeds solo leveling because you spend less time sitting.
---
Or just getting the recommended amount of sleep for muscle growth?
---
implying that anyone that is born after 2000 is incapable of understanding how classic works and what makes it great?
---
Yes you can, you only need level 50 for both https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5002301-233051030300055
---
SO MUCH
---
What's east of Easteros?
---
He had to ask my permission mate
---
Neither post is funny but this interaction between you 2 is hahahahq
---
Well I can obviously be surprised but from my experience, most of BWL until Nef wasn't a lot more difficult than Ragnaros so if Phase 3 is released in something like 6 months and most raiding guild have 2-3 months worth of T1 gear on top of full blue BiS, it won't be very hard either even for casual guilds.
---
(and then it's another few months waiting for AQ40 which is the first raid that I expect to have some kind of challenge)
---
What server are you on. Pvp or pve
---
You can, but you need exalted with that faction I believe
---
This same fucker will then group with several friends and join in slaughtering you of you let him live.

i wish i could give you gold
---
Added in patch 1.13...
---
Hell no I quit a while ago. Theres just aspects of this game like this that I forgot about. I also will quit classic.
---
Or rogues? not that hard to spy on people who cant see you.
---
and throwing around autists as a insult is pathetic, grow up will ya?
---
Sharing our experiences is a part of the human condition... quit projecting.  Not everyone is looking for validation.
---
Ah thats what he meant, ok. I have seen that mistake so many times now in games lol
---
Is it faster to level with dungeons or quest?
---
After having lost whitemanes chapeau to a DPS paladin twice.... it starts to look appealing.
---
What makes classic great is that the player base is that the player base isn’t fragmented across 10 expansions.
---
Given how small the population of people running that addon is vs the wow user base.. i'm surprised how accurate it ever is.
---
Nowhere. Blizzard blocked the addon these kind of websites use.
---
I'm going for my rogue set. I don't care what a tierlist says, I'm going to run around in that t2 set as much as I can.
---
Not so much anymore. Blizzard broke the census taking addons that these websites were using, so that players couldn't use them to decide about servers and create more player-made population issues.
---
This was cool man, I laughed and enjoyed it a lot
---
Install questie and look at world map, there will def be a place to go with quests.
---
I only got my mount because of LW. Skilled to 200 with leather I looted myself and then to 250 with thick leather from the AH, selling Nightscape headbands. If you get a stack of Leather under 1g40s you even make a profit.
---
Then I proceeded to sell 2 cured rugged hides for 70g each with my refined deeprock salt. Easy money
---
Another healer who cant deal with lifetap. Just learn to play already
---
Useful to circumvent encounter mechanics for a first kill or speed clear.  First one they won't have to worry about, second one would only shave of a couple of seconds for one try.  So yeah, in the end a PvP use is more sensible. I'm just wondering that they use it so early. At least now they have one bag slot more available for consumables.
---
I hit 40 on Sunday night, currently 5 bars from 44. Maybe I’ll get burnt out soon, but my guild needs me!
---
I did this, but traded in skinning for herbalism once i hit 40
---
They is where they come in and say, “we hear you’re upset, and to lighten the mood, we’ll sell you this pitchfork tmog for just $10!”

Extra Burning Steppes straight up sunk into the ocean in Cata. So it probably wasn't all that important.

Next level, simply; ice barrier, run in, spam arcane explosion and either die or rinse and repeat
---
If you were the best in the world at something, even if it's something as mundane as WoW Classic, wouldn't you want to gloat about it?
---
Well - if I was you I would reroll to be totally honest.
---
I don't have a Problem with leveling until I reach 35-40ish and then I start getting annoyed because it takes Ages to Level xD
---
Also I love the starting zones. 
---
It depends... Do you think you will be happy with the Server inbalance once you reach Level 60? Will it still annoy you at that Point? Because there is no Point in keeping going if in the end you will have the same dilemma.
---
I hoenstly wouldn't mind it myself at max Level. But it would be enough for me to have so much trouble leveling to decide to reroll...
---
So if I was you I would swap Servers. Or factions :D
---
There is just no Point in keeping going. Things are not gonna Change and probably just get worst once the PVP System is in place in Phase 2
---
Yes this might be a lot of work but blizzard said them self that Classic has the full wow development team behind them, if anyone can do it it's them. I always refer to old school runescape and how much of a success it has become compared to the "new" runescape.  
---
To be honest this is the moment where we all vote with out wallet, If we still play more classic in 6 months than anything else they will have to act on that, They know damn well that going down the TBC route will just lead to the same outcome.
---
Actual funny post, nice bait OP.
---
The good old classic experLience
---
Imagine finding 2 enemy soldiers sparring in your back yard and letting them live.
---
*there
---
Yeah, it's ironic this guy is insulting someone for not having an idea about the game when he's blatantly incorrect about tanking at lower levels...
---
There's literally no evidence that this player was using such a program.
---
Find a group to kill the elite mobs.

He might emd up in westfall

Both of these dudes jus totally missed the point of your question lol

The problem with this list is that a bunch of the quests on there are tied to events or only available at a later stage. However, I appreciate it a lot, it will help a bunch! Thank you very much.
---
Pick up questie.  It will show on the big map where you have clusters of quests.  Hold down shift while hovering over them and you can see what the quests are and if they are worth doing.
---
Silent changes are bad even if the change is posotive overall, shows lack of communication, but changes in general when well communicated are fine.

Does it affect absolutely everything, even the map? Or are there several addons you have? Does it work with weak auras? I'd like to clean up my bars which are getting messy as a warlock.

Negative, it’s definitely the same person. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Daisy

As an avid Horde player I don’t often give respect to the Alliance. But you have done well to honor your friend. May Scribler go forth! Ride Eternal, shiny, &amp; chrome.

I must be the only mage that will focus target my tank and Polly something they're not attacking.

That’s true. Damn.

Yo you the real tips

Everything taking so long?  How long has the game even been out?  Geez.  Stop and smell the roses

Have you ever played video games before? Literally the biggest group of autists you'll find outside of an art school, there's a pretty good chance he was being serious?
---
Almost as if the ones who are paid to play currently focus on a completely different game.

The Road is just as good too. I’ve got All the Pretty Horses on hand but waiting for the right state of melancholy.

Nope. If you're 100% sure they actually sent the mail and you're 100% sure they spelled your character name right, you can try to have them open a ticket to see if a gm can find it.
---
Are those the cats on the island just of the coast from  Senjin village?
---
They always topped all the private servers and had very tight control over the devilsaur mafia and ranking during the beginning of each server's life. Naturally this gave them a lot of haters because of how many people were getting slighted by them, but you have to respect the dedication and skill put forth to have such a tight grip over it all. In a personal level, the vast majority of their members are just very serious about wow and want to have fun through being the best. Besides a few arrogant players, they're chill guys having fun
---
Unfortunately thats not the case

---
There's a nice list in this sub, right on the top, which gives you better info on that. But please keep in mind - while Skull and X are generall percieved as main and second target, the other symbols interpretation differs between servers and regions
---
And you camped them because they were dumb enough to res one by one right?

Level 20 in 25 hours played isn't bad.  He took a month to get to 20 because he hardly gets time to log in.  A guide won't magically fix that

For people who haven't played MMOs in a while, the difference between "do you want to sell x?" And "l want to sell x" is arbitrary

Thank you! This will help me tremendously.
---
I play as a healer and it’s far too often I have to spam heal a warlock using hellfire on 1 or 2 mobs...
---
I tend to agree with you, completely -- as in -- 9/10 these stories are made up/fabricated but, surely, there are some that are true.  It's not unlikely that there's a large group of people, who played wow at some time that are no longer with us today, given that wow has been out since 05.  I've never made a post or anything, as I don't really see the point, but I've been in a similar situation as "OP" (assuming it's true).  My roommate and best friend, who I first started playing with, killed himself in October of 2012 (so it's even possible that OP's friend and my roommate died around the same time).  We had a really close friendship and went through a lot together and I can't help but think of him almost every time I fire up the game.  I've thought about making a character with his old name as well, but figure I'll do that some other time as my main is only level 10. 
---

---
Anyway, yeah, this story and the majority of them are probably sugar coated bullshit, but just figured I'd tell you that there are _some_ true ones out there, though, it's possible that the true ones don't have associated posts on reddit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

With all its quests, BRD is like a complete D&amp;D campaign.

They live happily on a farm with their animal friends. I promise, don't be sad.
---
They controlled world bosses pretty regularly on private servers, and even if you have LoE you have to have an alliance (multiple guilds, 3+ 40 man raids) if you want to seriously compete for any world boss besides Kazzak
---
I remember watching this video soooo much at the times I couldn't play when WoW just came out.
---
This video litterally gave me chills! Love this game!
---
mages have always been the devs' pet class
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
On average I'd say quests.
---
If you have a few quests for a particular dungeon, that is a good choice.
---
If you have a good group and can speedrun dungeons that may be better than questions.
---
It's all about efficiency, best case I find is when I have  a number of quests all in the same area.
---
Single use. Alliance can only get it once per character and can only use it once.
---
He looks so happy lmao, adoreable

A+ title

I'm imagining this gnome druid, having shapeshifted into a bear cub, use feral charge. Same model but just reduced in size, meaning the charge animation will look hilarious.
---
The time you posted this is like the opposite of peak hours.
---
My lock is only lvl 13 atm in classic but in vanilla I distinctly remember that the Eye didn't share its aggro with the caster unless they were pulled back to the lock.
---
Fuck yeah it will. For someone who gets to play a few hours a week I am at 40 with 5 days played because of a guide. It will absolutely help if you find a proper guide that is efficient with the routes and quests.
---
That's reasonable. I kind of enjoyed leveling a new class on another faction but then my friends on that server/faction stopped playing so I abandoned that character. I try to stay where my friends are, but they haven't played as much as me. Guess that's my fault though and I should just try to make more friends.
---
I agree that burnout is inevitable, but sometimes you can soften the blow by changing your pattern of play for the game. I was wondering what other people do in that case.
---
I'm rather unfamiliar with private servers and the mentalities of the people who played on them.
---
Roll an alt and take a break.  I'm almost 60 but still play on my alt occasionally because it's a change of pace.  I don't feel as rushed.  Helps refresh me then I go back to the grind.
---
Fuck rogues.
---
It doesn't
---
Maggots?
---
Nice binds
---
They really don't care about PvE numbers. They do speedruns and get through it as fast as possible, but they are a PvP guild at heart and everything they do is in the interest of killing the opposite faction. Once the honor system is introduced, I have no doubt that 80%+ of their guild will be r13/14
---
Such as? Normally I would use the pvp trinket, but they aren't out yet.
---
Further progress will be carried on. If you are at 2nd boss and raid is at 4th boss, you can continue from 4. 2 and 3 will be locked out.
---
Lol
---
Like did it ever occur to you that MAYBE someone who is playing a 15 year old MMO to nostalgia trip could be someone who is a little unstable?
---
I was running a cat the past few days and constantly pulling aggro to myself, which was not a problem in earlier levels with a boar. I was considering going back to my boar before I read this. I had dash, bite, claw, and growl on auto, and it never occurred to me that claw was eating all my pet focus so growls weren't happening. Once I took claw off auto (as you said) I had zero problems with my cat losing threat to me, and as you said, micro-managing a claw or two when you are close to focus cap is no big deal. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Are mages the new hunters?
---
Face is the place.
---
Would honestly be better to get back to his pc and find himself alive in Westfall.
---
Death is the strongest CC in the game
---
Cringy post all around
---
At level 20, my priest's mana bar is the size of six heals. Six. And I don't even have bad gear.
---
I hope this gets better, but in the meantime I just want my party to know that six bullets in the chamber is very little, especially on boss pulls or surprise pats, etc.
---
If you "go go go" and I'm struggling to drink or catch up, I may not even have all six.
---
It's once per alliance char. You get one from a low level quest and it isn't repeatable. Now they have used this they will never be able to pull the same trick again.
---
When you're in arguably the best guild in the world, you can make whatever requirements you want really, but epic mounts are extremely important if you want to have a death ball rolling around like this video. Any slow mounters would be caught behind and killed
---
I absolutely love healing when we have a prot Pala tank.
---
Negative, you need to get in their deadzone so they cant do shit. You can usually CC the pet beforehand as well.
---
Source: I'm a huntard
---
Naw I went with shadow then changed at 30 for shadow/disc for the buffs and wand to make leveling easier. Haven’t died at like all
---
"Bye, have a wonderful time!"
---
*waves*
---
you can always try it with a shaman tank
---
I would guess someone is using their pet very poorly or nobody is killing the runners.  Hard to really tell though but either of those could definitely cause issues.  I think I have been pretty lucky and most of the hunters I have had in my groups have good pet control (warlocks as well mostly).
---
Just look at all the bosses you're likely to fight, find the highest one, and subtract 3.  That's the bare minimum IMO for any dungeon.
---
You are right in some instances, we're talking about different places.  In places like UD Strat or Sunken Temple AOE is way more viable no matter the group come, because you have packs that have say, 2 elites + 4 nonelites.  AOE is good there because tank can focus on the 2 elites while you pull aggro on the nonelites after maybe doing 30-50% of their HP.  it's easy for you to finish them off with minimal risk to yourself. 
---
I'm talking about like, SM Library where it's always 2-3 elites per pull.  In that scenario with only one AOE you do enough damage to pull aggro (or make it trickier for the tank) but not enough to do significant amounts of damage.  
---
Plus I'm a druid tank, so no chance of 2hander, sweeping strikes =p
---
But you make good points and seem to understand your class properly.  My rant is not focused at you =p
---
1v1 Warriors just lose against a good mage unless there's a LOT going in the Warrior's favour.
---
 /Who isn't going to show 120 players, only 50? I think.  Their scout is probably just a rogue that is really good at headcounts.
---
Sometimes my hunter shoots with his polearm
---
If you are horse go to shadowprey village and do the repeatable turn in quest for the shellfish or lobster, whatever they are. 55silver per turn in, I lazily get about 12g an hour if no one is there
---
found the mage
---
I’m the friendliest mage on our server :) ..unless you dare attack one of our own - then I call up the homies and go on a killing spree until you scum are rid from my zone
---
I just got 3 pieces + 2 other shadow pieces, ended up 85 shadow damage and difference is noticable. But then again, for me it costs only 2-3 gold per pieces on low pop server.
---
No problem! Common issue, claw is just such a focus-hungy ability. Hope it smooths out your leveling!
---
I too, can combine three memes into one.
---
If it comes back in the mail next day it gets vendored.
---
And I only make one action for 8 hours, mostly around 18:00h
---
But only put it on AH if I think the item will be worth something in the first place (like INT + STA or AGI + STA etc)
---
Oh, duh. Thanks.
---
there is also an addon called Max Cam
---
True. Ask Chris Brown.
---
None of you actually know what you're talking about. The term "spellcleave" originates from arena teams back in BC and WotLK that focused on have multiple caster dps. Surely you can see how that naturally translates to dungeon groups that focus on having multiple caster dps with strong aoe.
---
I've encountered simillar situations over and over again, and I can't understand why people tend to get so extremly upset if someone else wins a roll. If a mace drops and both classes can use it, and it is an upgrade; need on it. I mean, who are you to tell other people what is an upgrade for them and what isnt? Just because it isnt OPTIMAL for a rogue to have X, it doesnt mean that its not an UPGRADE.
---
I've had mail take a longer time than epected, but no I've never not got stuff. Maybe there's another character on your server that has a similar name? I know I've gotten stuff sent to me that probably wasn't ment for me.
---
It's probably because Horde - I completely forget about paladins lately until they are brought up by an ally player outside the game.
---
Yeah, some healers just refuse to heal through it. Renews go a long way. If the lock is using it to go below 50% during combat, not pulling aggro, and you have the mana....just heal them. It helps clear speed, and is better than having an oom lock just wanding if you have mana to go around. 
---
On the other side, I've had locks stay at 20% and go HAM on dps during a pull that I'm low on mana with, then blame me when they pull aggro and die after expecting to be healed through anything. Tank is always #1.
---
Peer pressure is the worst.
---
Yeah, 1g is a ridiculous amount. When I already have a lot of water in my bags I just tell people to tip whatever they want (get anywhere from 1s to 1g on tips). If I have to actually make it then I still either ask for tips or if I'm trying to save up for something I ask for 20s a stack.
---
If they liked padded meters, all melee would be human. They're gnomes for a reason. They don't care for meters, just speedruns
---
/chicken in front of a high level player when they attack you out of the blue has shown to be quite effective. Either they stop or pop cooldowns to get rid of you faster.
---
But then again, it's a PvP server :-)
---
You actually called her wifey on your phone and not her name? Lol...
---
This poor man had a family.
---
You can but some people might not like it.  Not a big deal, just look for another group.
---
As dps your mana should hold find unless you pull extra.  Make sure you come prepared with water and drink immediately between pulls.  Try to snipe kills for tap and remember that wanding is fine, you don't need to always be using mind flay or something like that.
---
Shity people are the bad guys
---
Why follow the crowds if you don't like the game? You'll make the game worse for everyone else.
---
Are you sure you spelled the name right and didn't send to a diff server? Never heard of such a thing.
---
It’s actually still more efficient mana wise to aoe 3 mobs than do one at a time. So often while questing if I can gather a few mobs together I will. Sometimes that’s only 3-5. More entertaining than aoe farm farm but still efficient
---

Very first Deadmines group I tried to join I had someone telling me half the items I'd be interested in "were on reserve". I noped out of that pretty quickly.
---
Well, yeah.. leveled 27-60 through doing that ;)
---
Play mage myself and I agree. Im not a good player but seeing some people  backpedal panic blinkfrostnobashriek is astounding.
---
Also it good a bad reputation because of all the AOE dungeon farm levellers.

Playing a class with no cc, where's your god now?
---
I think you do. Since logging in with the same account twice should be impossible.

to the writer of this ... on what server?!

I also did this with a buddy that passed away.

He will forever be a lvl 100 troll hunter

I know this reference SMASH

Preach my fel brother

Getting anywhere close to a Shaman as a Mage - bad move. 
---
Max range or dead range - level 60 or not, doesn’t matter
---
Shazzrah eu is infested with hordes stealing from other hordes. Opposite faction is fair game imo but trying to steal from your own should be bannable
---
STV.... more like STD ;)
---
On what ground?
---
He's probably butthurt shit is cheap which is just more due to the fact there are twice as many people on even low populated realms which means more people farming. 
---
I never understand how people get upset over cheaper mats in the AH. You dont need to make a lot of money if you don't have to spend alot
---
Princess is 51 so you would have a tough time hitting her at 46. It's possible, but you would probably want other higher level dps in your party.
---
Its not Sylvanas, its the voice actor of Maiev Shadowsong
---
I know this is a typo. But I love to think you actually yelling that.
---
I took blacksmithing because I agreed in advance to be our guild's armorsmith, but if I weren't otherwise engaged I'd go mining/engineering, mining/skinning, or herbalism/skinning.  Definitely take engineering if you're on a PvP server.
---
Please don't stop making these
---
Eventual auto logout.
---
Well eso is like Skyrim but your immersion is broken by other players constantly so idk what to tell ya
---
Had a similar experience at booty bay. Me and two other random allies went on the boat to ratchet. Me, a human warrior lvl 47, and the other 2 were +42.  Also 4 horde players boarded. 3 of them below lvl 25 and one lvl 44. For no apparent reason they started spitting on me and the others taunting us. I checked for hidden high level rogues with perception and found none. After setting sail and  getting out of reach of the booty bay npcs, we obliterated 3 and a priest mind controlled one into deep water, probably making him drown or swim for minutes. Don't know what they wanted to achive.
---
I have 300 gold at level 47 and i buy blue gear every 5 levels, gold is not that much issue for some people.
---
I ran my first dungeon run in classic in like a decade the other day. I set need before greed initially because it seemed fair, and I honestly didn't know the difference between group loot and nbg looting and neither did my SO.
---
I was rudely called out on it during the run and I ended up changing it.
---
Some people don't know all the little details, it could very well have been a mistake.
---
i dont think im allowed to post when im inspired by my succubus
---
I am obviously doing something wrong, I do run out of mana at level 40. Maybe not enough shadow spell damage?
---
Just not to the same faction.
---
Positive. You can't send to other servers and as I said I tried to send mail myself from an alt.
---
Depends on if you are alone., the level difference and your mana pool.
---
I mean if I could make money selling shitty bathwater I'd do the same thing. If you don't have to, fuck a 9-5. More WoW time.
---
And no I didn't buy one, that's fuckin' gross.
---
Yes mail from my alt to my main is taking forever, I thought mail between your own characters was instant..
---
A bad warlock is a warlock that life taps when we're going between pulls to the point they start a fight with low HP. If everyone else is drinking it gives a warlock no excuse to life tap. Sit your ass down and drink (all warlocks, not just you).  
---
Also, I don't heal warlocks most of the time either as a shaman. If you want to sit at 10-20% hp and I never see you use a healthstone, drain life, or bandages, you do you. The only time I heal warlock who life taps is during combat and they are legit out of mana on a boss fight. But only if they tap like 2-3 times. Most do not. Most do it until "full mana" even if they are 1 shot from death, and that shit gets old fast.
---
it's not about what layering solves it's about the abuse it causes.
---
It's not useless. It wastes mana/rage/energy. And slows between shifts. Still worth using imo
---
Or you could just be excited that enough people are playing that shit is cheap enough where you don't have to grind just to afford basic things.
---
If Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer (aka Ony’s Buff) were truly “crippling” to them, they would have Warchief’s Blessing on as well. But considering that in the video they state epic mounts will only be a requirement in two weeks, it looks like they haven’t enforced on their members yet the requirement to have the ability to gain the Blessing.
---
And it’s not like they haven’t already cleared MC already, or were the first guild in these classic servers to do so, or did it with multiple sub-60s and with less gear than they have now...
---
Your friend is right.  I hate playing with mages, they have no concept of agro.
---
Just to provide an alternative.. I found drain tanking slow and boring early on. I specced into ruin as early as I could and shadow bolt most enemies to death. It means I stop and drink more, but the fights are more fun to me and I can wreck dungeons.
---
So ridiculously OP Mages are.
---
No free action pot=no chance.
---
RIP.
---
Priest. A healie boi priest.
---
I'm RPing as a podracer who got teleported from the starwars universe to azeroth by a gnome
---
DW fury requires a much higher hit rating in order to make use of your off hand and theres no hit gear until the higher levels. Mortal Strike is nice for the reduction of healing and usually hits like a truck which is nice when you pull 2 adds and pop sweeping strikes.
---
I think it's pretty unreasonable to demand from a party member tbh. It costs them almost nothing to conjure some water. I don't charge for health stones, soul stones and summons in a party, and those all take a reagent I have to "farm". Why do mages get a pass to charge for literally just spending a bit of mana and cast time?
---
Unless auctioneer is lying, I can confirm there are more alliance auctions up on heartseeker than there are on skeram. Transferred last night.
---
I'm Alliance on Incendius and it certainly feels like the less populated faction. As I'm nearing max level, I'm starting to get worried that enough people won't be playing the faction to keep the raiding scene alive and healthy. Should I be concerned or am I blowing this out of proportion?
---
I played wow for a month or so in WoD with a friend and shortly quit after, never even entertained WoW when I was younger as I was a RuneScape kid.
---
Trust me, it's not nostalgia. Classic is easily one of the best MMOs/games I've ever played.
---
PW:S ftw.
---
Once you’re at 40 the best thing to do is go deep shadow.  Shadow form is too good.  Then just put the rest of your points after 40 into disc
---
Stick em with the explody end!
---
That 2nd last quest with 3 big ones? I'd be surprised if they could be feared, but you never know. I tried soloing the last quest myself by kiting the dude to SW and that seemed to work too, until he just despawned in Swamp of Sorrows. Sometimes odd cheesing works and you never know when. Anyhow there's no much point trying to get the 2nd last quest completed if you still can't solo the final boss. I do wonder if he COULD be soloed though as dotter, because he generally doesn't move faster than you. I kept him tagged with faeriefires that do no dmg, but maybe lock could kill him while kiting for 10mins :)
---
I ran SM Lib last night with a Hunter and 2 mages as DPS.
---
I swear the mages would Blizzard on any pull with more than 1 mob. The hunter topped my DPS meter and had double the damage of the 2nd place. Oh and also 2nd place on DPS was me, the tank.
---
I'm positive the run would have been faster and easier if they were just wanding the skull target the whole time instead.
---
Right? It's a game, the goal is fun. How the hell can it not be worth it if it was fun.
---
It’s ok, I can give you better cringe. I would be broke as a 70 healer paladin so I would disenchant my gear, like Kara gear... for crystals for gold and go back to raid the next week in greens/blues...  I’m surprised the people I played with didn’t come to my door and slam my face with a keyboard like in the movie wanted.
---
Fighting muscle memory is hard.  It's also difficult when Multi-Shot actually works like Chain Lighting and not like a cone which can cause some interesting things to happen.  If you choose a target that's positioned properly, you can hit someone in your deadzone with Multi-Shot.
---
Salv is the best mage buff in the game.
---
Haha yea, unfortunately I can only use it once every hour. :P
---
I see you guys everywhere
---
No, the price will go down, not up. The initial high price was because banking and selling deviates is a good trick for start of server money making, but the value decreases quickly as more people get access to that recipe.
---
Hard to say what the price will be though, someone else in this thread said they got it for 2g, I checked my server and it was going for 5g, on my PServer it was going for more like 8g and that was around the release of naxx.
---
facepalm
---
Yes, only on swords.
---
dont learn first aid for the sake of having a high first aid skill, learn first aid because its actually useful?
---
After linen the recipes are always yellow for first aid iirc
---
Besiktas 🙌
---
they probs just use invincibility pots instead shorter duration but probably get the job done.
---
I’m horde on Incendius, hows it going?
---
So according to the census at http://wowpop.appspot.com/ we are a pretty balanced server. I think the raiding scene will be fine.
---
The zones I frequent are usually alliance heavy, WPL/EPL usually have alliance gank squads dominating. You can’t even land in Lights Hope Chapel without getting killed 25% of the time.
---
All demon camps are camped by alliance (a good indicator for raiders because the demonic rune is a raid consumable).
---
All that to say, it seems like you might be in horde heavy zones. Also, these servers are much larger than they were in vanilla, and the vanilla raiding scene was fine. I think you’re blowing things out of proportion.
---
I’ll see you on the battlefield, alliance scum.
---
I see you guys everywhere lol

even classic elemental?
---
What’s with posts on this sub going from right to left with the images
---
I find it amusing how every hunters does surprised pikachu face, when their multishot breaks sheep.  
---
And right on the next pull they do it again.
---
holy, the stars aligned mate. =D
---
Tbf atm that's expected because servers are holding 5x that amount. Layering does reduce the strain on the servers but its unknown by how much. We don't know how they'll be without layering.
---
Also, isn't there more players in this clip? Like twice the amount. It's more than 1 raid group of horde like in your clip.
---
Let the bodies hit the FLOOOOOOOORRRRRRRR *guitars intensify*
---
Ya I tell my boss that at work too. I don't fix my screw up right away. I learn from them. I "gather information about them". He didn't buy it.
---
What stops you drinking after clearing? What stops you from using life drain? Trash tank or getting aoe damaged stops me healing locks with no empathy. If I have spare mana, I'll renew locks. If he hardcore taps to get %100 mana between fights, I'll let him stay like that.
---
there's only two pulls.  one mage does blizzard.  pulls aggro on second kill target.  tank runs back and forth.
---
rinse and repeat for max efficiency
---
Aka a cesspool guild
---
Very true.  Bear tanks can hold threat for at least the gathering and first handful of seconds but once you lose threat you're better off popping out and help heal, or go into bear to stun/feral charge mobs that are breaking away from the pack.
---
and what can one do against ice block and poly? Literally nill
---
Likewise. You’re taking it personally. Be a little more insecure.
---
I play roughly an hour or two a night 4 days a week. Also a lot of that time is afk time when the queues were 4/7 hours.
---
What I did was have a stealth macro which equipped my dagger in my main hand and then I had an ambush macro which equipped my sword in my main hand after casting ambush. The macro it self worked really well but I switched back to a combat swords build because the ambush/hemo build I was using was pretty subpar/I didn't really know how to use it effectively. 
---
The item slots for the main hand and offhand are 16 and 17 btw. I can paste the actual macro I used later if you're having trouble with it but it really don't that complicated.
---
Well there are no aiming so the only I can think of is squeezing into small spaces, but does that actually make much of a difference?
---
For melee you also have to consider the fact that leeway seems to be bigger on a bigger model which can be useful.
---
Woah , get a load of this jelly kid
---
Hi, how does that character icon addon(name, health bar, mana bar) name ? Thank you
---
This counfounds me a little, yes, most bis guides shows more than the 9% needed (itens+tallent).
---
Those bis gears also look like shit.
---
Yeah, maybe i'm not a tryhard/hardcore guy, but i actually made a shadowcraft set with the 9% hit rating and not looking like shit..
---
Maybe my dps will be a little lower but at least i wont kill myself when i open my char menu.
---
Gotcha.
---
I'm more than fine with players doing things in groups they shouldn't. Swings miss, agro is lost, and fights go sideways. It happens. I think we all deliberately do things in groups we shouldn't at times. And I'm glad you're aware that your actions can be fround upon.
---
But please don't get upset if you get kicked or fussed at for the behavior.

When I was hitting 40 tin and bronze bars were selling all day, iron nope, nada. Right now some days at 60 when more of Nethergarde population reached 50+ I'm selling Thorium bars. Devilsaur leather is still meh market but there is some traffic there at least. People tend to have gold if they are 50+  and at 60 if you complete to finish quests, do instances - that hundreds of gold quickly from quests and vendorables alone. The problem is people are good at avoiding costs - as devilsaurs are still easily available they go get their own leather. For less convenient things like multiple pots or herbs they are more likely to buy, but they may look how to get cheaper flasks for example.
---
Alchemy if you dump various pots constantly will sell all the time. Thorium bars will sell but at lower margins than currently sought after consumables. Arcane crystals, Arcanite bars will sell, but more often on spikes when new phase unlocks something. Skinning will get relegated to guild skinning in raids for the most part. BS will be only those BiS craftables, Enchanting - end game enchants, later on oils, LW - some resistance gear later on, Tailoring - mooncloth, then resistance gear and more mooncloth for naxx token turn ins. And don't forget fishing - free action pots, greater firepower in the future and lower fire prot potions right now.
---
Ok, in that context the item makes sense. If it was reusable, that'd be insanely OP for world PvP.
---
Free action potion or wait to die. 
---
Once we get PvP trinket, things get interesting
---
Poor guy... It really is a shame people beat their kids, just to have other kids bully them at school. Maybe one day he will feel love, kindness, and friendship.
---
Northeron was probably just the Hinterlands, but I don't think it's ever been confirmed by anyone
---
Seems like a 'you' issue... who's fault is it that you took a node gathering profession on a class with no cc or other way to avoid fighting a mob?
---
As a mage, I don't see whats wrong with any of this.
---
Look, you clearly haven't thought this through. Take a few minutes to think about why any voting system in the world has a minimum requirement. Even Old School Runescape, which started off exactly the same way as Classic WoW, has minimum level requirements for who is allowed to vote in addition to requiring 75% approval for any changes and it's worked amazingly well.
---
what?

Macro time!

[https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Zones_by_level](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Zones_by_level)
---
I love this site for easy to use checklist of zones by level. Looks like there are 10 different zones you could be in at level 40.
---
Because for many people, playing a game with friends outweighs playing something else alone.  Playing with friends it not the same as following the crowds.
---
I do this when I get tired of spamming my only other ability, frostbolt.
---
makes it easier to watch videos
---
My favorite is the lock that taps all the way down to be close to dead after every pull then just stands there as I’m sitting drinking.. he don’t get healed
---
The lock that taps a couple times and I see him trying to get mana back, I gladly heal his taps throughout the instance
---
Which water do you guys prefer? Ultra (as in this screenshot), or vanilla water ("Low" setting in Classic) which uses a different technique and is more ripply? I actually like the old water, and turned it on despite everything else being on max settings.
---
I actually made a bunch of zone to go in these places based on the classic style:

Get a job and get hurt on the job. Thats the ticket in the US.
---
Its been great. Got two lvl 60s, mage and priest. Both have most of their bis and both their epic robes and epic mounts. Now im just chilling lvling my lvl 38 warrior.
---
Agi doesn't increase attack power, but it gives more crit chance which is good for proccing Flurry. Strength is what increases your attack power.
---
Ideally you'll want lots of both, but it really depends on if you want to focus on lots of small crits, or a few big crits. Personally for leveling I like lots of small crits, because it creates a good feedback loop (crit = flurry = more attacks = more chances to crit = more flurry, etc).
---
Wasn't there one called African Turtle cleave. Man leave was always my favourite, prot warrior, arms warrior, prot holy paladin
---
Hit works differently on mobs vs players. Hit rate is okay while underleveled, no glancing, no crush, etc.
---
What sealed it was the hunter literally did nothing (didn't even attack with pet)
---
...what do you think, dude?
---
&gt;Gives you a 1% chance to get an extra attack on the same target after dealing damage with your sword
---
Gee, idk, maybe it works with axes yeah
---
5 Days to get 40 people in perfect sync of grinding and have everything planned out to the last detail takes quite a lot of dedication. I don't even like them but i respect that.
---
Your choices are:
---
- Continue Night Elf questing by going into Ashenvale. I'd aim for level 18 minimum, but Darkshore can get you to 20. Ashenvale is an *enormous* zone that can easily see you up to around level 30.
---
- Go to the "main" (most popular) Alliance questing zones in Westfall and then Redridge Mountains. You can go to Westfall immediately at level 16, as it's for 10+. You could also get away with going to Redridge but like with Ashenvale I'd aim for 18. After that there's Duskwood which is minimum 20+.
---
- Go live with the Dwarves and move to Loch Modan, which is 10+. From there you can move into the Wetlands, which is 20+.
---
That is a good point, but addons can always sort that out for you I guess?
---
Didnt work well for me xp wise, princess runs too few mobs and full runs too big with people getting lost regularly, ZF is good enough 44-52 then definitely BRD 52+
---
You have a 'right' to try and form a group on the basis of reserved loot, but imo it isn't in the spirit of the game. I know people think differently, but precluding others from loot that is useful for them just because you *need it so much* is tragically tryhard.
---
Put it on high amount with 12h cd. If it's not going, get lower until it satisfies you. Ofc don't drop below the price of other twink items etc.
---
&gt; I need to sit and wait for your mana to come back from zero.
---
No you don't. Just wait until the heal is full mana, the mage will wait a bit longer before joining the fight, it's not an issue.
---
guess i'm cloth farming to 60
---
Definitely common. And yours is the only bad attitude I see.
---
Yeah, If I see a warlock being an asshat and doing that kind of stuff I usually inform them that if they take themself below 30% health by  hellfiring, then they have to save/heal themself. :)
---
That was incredible, well done.  
---
I didn't like the part with Asmongold in it, but it is what it is.
---
    Sword Specialization	Rank 5
---
    
---
    Requires Rogue (Combat)
---
    Requires One-Handed Swords, Two-Handed Swords
---
    Gives you a 5% chance to get an extra attack on the same target after dealing damage with your Sword.
---
I mean, did you even *attempt* to figure it out before asking here? The talent description says it at least 2 different ways lol
---
So it only really matters with gnomes vs the rest? Male orc vs female is just a minor difference?
---
Yeah, I've only found out last night that backpeddling does not trigger leeway which is pretty useful
---
U know a geared warrior with buffs can actually 1shot a mage? Literally 1shot
---
a low level Hunter might be ok, they can do (low)damage even when lower in levels, but casters are just useless if the do not have absurd +hit gear.
---
Aha aye
---
Yes, but it definitely sucks as a non Mage / Warlock / Priest trying to get groups. The extra emphasis on AoE dungeon runs is thoroughly understandable as it’s such a highly efficient way to grind, but it never had this much prominence in Vanilla where I never had the kind of issues I do now trying to get a group. So while it’s just a “lighthearted joke,” in the context of the AoE craze it does absolutely annoy me.
---
GAMERGATE
---
There is nothing more natural then a bear. Bears don't even need to worry about clothing so they have no concept of what a birthday suit is.
---
Yeah it was great man, such a wasted opportunity of a game in the end. :(
---
Totally forgot a warlock without a pet, mana, or health is a pvp god and stands a fair chance against a fully healed enemy. Thanks for the reminder
---
That's unfortunate. 
---
But your BIS trinkets don't come from MC anyway. One is a quest reward you should already have, the other two choices drop in UBRS.
---
Ephemeral power is a nice trinket and all but I'd say the utility of a 'use' trinket for +power is pretty much as applicable to a healer as an oh-shit button as it is to you as a DPS cooldown.
---
If I were a DPS and the tank was rolling on dps gear without having previously said something (especially if you have a DPS warrior or roll on DPS leather or rings) I'd be extremely pissed.
---
Can you explain this? After a frost nova I always mouseturn a 180, get some distance, then mouseturn back because I figure running forward is faster. Am I doing it wrong?
---
Yeah that's great, let's make it so meme specs can become good specs only after you get to 60 and progress through the original vanilla content!
---
Because let's face it, if any plus content isn't more rewarding than naxx gear, it won't interest people who have cleared naxx for very long.  And if it is harder, then it'll need even more power crept gear to compensate.  It'll just make issues worse.
---
The cleave meta is really messing with people heads lol. So many mages that'll spam aoe on 2 mobs, only to go oom every single pull. They'll top DMG that first pull then miss the next 2 while drinking
---
Nice, that ravager will last you until BRD.
---
Exactly, stuns are great because they allow you to save on some health, but if health isn't a problem then stuns aren't really that beneficial.
---
Same haha I’m a healer and when I need to ankh and res the group, I ask for tips or if I’m saving up for something, I charge 1g.
---
See how scummy that sounds?
---
Sorry I treat women as equals
---
You guys, you're the real heroes.
---
Heh ummm... I won’t answer that.
---
But. You know those ogres that wear what looks like sumo wrestler trunks? Yep.
---
And naga? Yep, them too.
---
AH - 1000g  
---
Say hello to a free Epic Mount
---
Yeah 4.0 so a couple of months before the expansion actually released, it got removed at the same time as mana for hunters.
---
It isn't optimal, but neither is my current weapon. Is always a good argument.
---
I am actually specc'd Arms and was taking the 2H advice until I got this 1H in a WC run and it is still higher DPS than any 2Hs that have dropped for me since :P
---
I haven't taken fishing yet but I've been going herb/skinning which covers repairs at least and hopefully as I get higher it'll be worth AHing stuff.
---
Most of my world PVP has been sorted with a quick /wave and being quicker to run away. The few that bother to chase me have just been 2v1s or lvl ??s. If they get me more than twice in a row I just park that char in an inn and go play an alt so I don't get frustrated.
---
You're not, people just like circlejerking against mages
---
As far as I know the hit and crit cap are somewhat relevant for each other. With buffs you could hit the crit cap. But only if your hit is high enough tho.. Also yeah going towards hard cap should be benifical after all
---
It's because Frost is best for AoE farming which is not only nice to have endgame but also if you're doing spellcleaves in instances. Frost is also the only viable pick for raids up until AQ, which a lot of people are doing. If you're focusing on PVP then yeah, go fire, but for PVE frost is the only viable pick and will remain that way for some time.
---
For classic most likely not.
---
Seriously, ran gnomer the other day and the mage was dropping blizzard before I had even connected with my first auto attack. Finally told him I wasn't chasing the mobs around, he could either hold his aoe till skull was dead (and I had aggro on everything), or kite.  Dude literally had no concept of aggro at all.
---
A mob at 1% hp deals the same damage to the tank as a mob with 100%. Also there are mechanics in higher level instances like enrages or heals that make AOE only efficient if the entire group is doing it. Then there are groups where one or two enemies are significantly more dangerous then the rest.
---
If you're just the mage you'll likely go oom before the group is dead and as the tnak has to survive the full damage of the pull longer before the first enemy drops it's also more likely that the healer goes oom. 
---
Then there is CC that nobody can use as the blizzard / AE will break it. 
---
The tank also has to built threat on all enemies. Most tanks build threat on only a few enemies first and only fairly weak threat on other targets. You'll aggro and now you either have to lower your DPS to kite or someone has to stuff to respond. More heals, taunts or changing position. 
---
AOE has its uses in dungeons but it shouldnt be the default behaviour.
---
Mage is so stupid easy...that's mindblowing to me as a Hunter.
---
&gt;I don't want a repeat of WC where it takes almost 2 hours from group form to finishing
---
Well unfortunately that's *about* how long those dungeons take lol (for full clears) -- not ZF though, that one is a breeze. 
---
In terms of mechanics none of the bosses in any of those dungeons are very complicated. Read through online guides, they should tell you everything you need to know about the bosses.
---
At 46 ZF is definitely doable (and mostly tank and spanks), however you'll have a hard time with Mara and you definitely will not be able to do ST. Mara you will likely be able to do orange/purple runs and get most of the quests out of the way, however I think you want to be 48/49 to tank princess. 
---
ST you'll be able to tank at 49 provided the rest of the group is higher -- I ran it the other night and our tank was 49 and I was 50 (healer. Our DPS were 2 mages and a lock, all 52-54, so I think we managed because of the high DPS. If we were all level 50 it would have been much harder I think.
---
Nah man no cons and the pro is that they can check your WoW client!!!!!!!!
---
That guy sounds like he's fun at parties. My biggest suggestion is find a like minded guild and run with them. The experience is a lot better when you are doing content with competent people who can laugh and have a good time in Discord as well.  
---
Making more friends will help a lot, because a lot of the end game is the social aspect. Once you do that, the rest of the content becomes a lot more enjoyable.
---
Recommend you pick up a few shirts to help with these situations.
---
My favorite is the Black Swashbuckler's Shirt - still a bit racy without the slutty overtones.
---
Pet attacked and misses twice.
---
Keyring was added to vanilla in the Naxxramas raid patch.
---
Blue post confirmed it for first patch major classic patch.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/key-ring-in-classic/253354/19
---
Thanks for that. I'd been pretty vigilant in other dungeons and things usually went fine and usually we knew why we pulled additional packs and could learn from the experience... just not so much with this.
---
Dude there other day I brought this goblin dude the heart of the mountain, a giant gem for which I had to fight my way into an underground fortress and conduct a bank heist. “Holy shit!” he says, “I can’t believe you actually got it! This thing is PRICELESS!” and proceeds to pay me 85s.
---
I dont think Asmon is one to blame even though its easy to do so. The problem is that these players are coming from retail where tanks never lose aggro and keeping health is super easy.
---
Nice tool! Would it be possible to add an option to ignore drops with less than x% drop rate?
---
That would make it a valuable tool for a consistent gold/h grind without “expecting” very rare valuable drops.
---
It’s beautiful to surrender, surreal to experience, and the grandeur is glorious. Welcome home.
---
When you loot they can start skinning, you'll never beat someone at skinning your kill so you need to get them off it by killing them or if it's same faction not looting and trying to get them bored and away from the kill.
---
"you'll need tier 2 gear to tank rfc"
---
god this so much. or they nova and stand in the middle of the nova'd mobs.
---
I’m a noob so when this first happened I panicked that I had lost the axe I had got from a dungeon.
---
Same place as you except I have three, a warrior, druid, and warlock. Basically I get on my warrior, wait to find a group, get into a dungeon and enjoy myself if it goes well and then I want to play my warrior forever. OR I get into a group, the dungeon goes horribly, two hours later I have two more bubbles of exp then when I started and I decide I never want to play warrior again, so I log to one of my alts.
---
Then I play the alt for a few levels, I love how I am having fun exploring the world..... but I think about how my warrior is a higher level already and I enjoy playing it. So I go back to the warrior, and the cycle repeats!
---
People sell them for 90 copper ok my server. I have stacks of them on an alt, and just throw them away or pass on them in instances now.
---
Max settings.  The zones look fantastic.
---
My mage friend is fully aware of his aggro. He used to raid with us in BWL and Naxx 15 years ago.
---
HE SIMPLY DOESN'T CARE.
---
He's 9-11 levels ahead of all of us, and is thirsty for us to catch up and AOE blast all of Scarlet Monastery together.
---
When doing elite-ogre quests, he's pulling everything away from the tanks, and everything in sight, and jumping like a muppet while blasting arcane explosion.
---
His friendly-fire deathcount almost exceeds the quests we're banging away.
---
Lots of people were against it. There are good stuff obviously, like being able to play with your friends on all level, but it made the game super linear, progression wise. I bailed after a while because progression became this one flat line of delving &gt; vet delve &gt; on repeat. Levels don't matter as much champ points grind was painful if you're not maxed, and there's very little difference between zone mobs in terms of difficulty.
---
I get why it's successful, but somehow nobody from Bethesda/Zenikek took the hint from Oblivion that level scaling sucks ass after a while, and just implemented it anyway.
---
You know a geared mage can actually 1 shot a warrior with pom pyro? Literally 1 shot
---
Is this reserve meme only on Feralina?
---
I am leveling on two servers and haven't seen people say some item is on reserve.
---
It's funny because some of the AoE dungeon farm levelers are the most infuriating people to play with. I play a mage and recently stopped joining spellcleave runs because people in it are the absolute worst. Every "normal" run I've had has been slower but an a delight.
---
hmmm mb that's the issue. will try with sm1 apart from our group
---
No jelly. No need for jelly. Jelly not even in consideration.
---
But the mage will still beat you. WoTF is a deciding factor in winning sometimes.
---
DAE UPVOTES

ITS THE CIRCLE OF GANK!!!

Lvl 36 warr here with 30g in ma wallet. Teach me master :O

You're so fat when you eat a savory deviate delight you shapeshift into aquatic form.

I don't understand what this has to do with my post
---
Are there any coming?
---
I feel like this post is something a retail snowflake would make...
---
Oof, you'd hate to be Alliance where Alliance is actually underpopulated then. There are no PvP servers that are in Alliances favor by a huge margin last time I checked. My server is 70/30, so it could be worse friend. I'd say you just got an unlucky layer.
---
I wouldn’t want paid transfers either. I liked wow before they added in all the extras and such.
---
Why don't you get me a cup of coffee, cafe latte, twist of lemon... sweet and low
---
warlocks have a lot of self sustain, just let them do their thing.
---
some warlocks are just always half health, but they do that on purpose.
---
Nice, i learned something today. Thanks, man.
---
Your current method is fine, assuming that you keep your wands updated. They are incredibly strong at that level, especially the overpowered Gravestone Scepter from BFD (if you havent already, go get it asap).
---
You can keep doing what you do right now until your mid 30's, at which point you should have 5/5 Fel Concentration, 5/5 Improved Drain Life and Syphon Life online, as well as the Succubus and Felhunter quests completed. 
---
The general idea is to dot the mob up with Corruption, Agony and Siphon Life and then tank the mob with Drain Life till it's dead. You can add and remove dots as needed, that's something you will get a feel for on your own. 
---
Once Dark Pact comes online at 40 the fun really begins. At that point you disable the autocast abilities of the Succubus / Felhunter and simply drain their mana after every fight (spam the button while on the move).
---
It's an incredibly safe leveling method, as you don't have to stay at low HP due to Lifetab-juggling and fighting several mobs at once. Great for PVP realms, great to avoid Rogue ganks.
---
And from that day forward anytime a group of animals is gathered in one place it's called a ZOO!
---
So much this. TBC did a great job to make meme specs work. I wish if Blizz would make Classic+ they could do something similar.
---
I've played on gehennas up until pretty much yesterday when I finally had enough of the queues. Did dungeons with a bunch of APES guys before. Pretty nice guys from my experience tbh.
---
Had this warlock do this to me several times yesterday after I sheeped. And then be proceeded to dot the moon..
---
The zone north-west of Eastern plaguelands ist Stratholme.

And the zone north-west of Elwyn forest ist Stormwind.

1. I'm a healer. I tried to not be small-minded last night and had a paladin tank in SM Cath. It sucked. One Heal Rank 4 would often pull threat. I whispered him so as not to call him out in the group and he said yeah that's how it is, they have no taunt. Do they get better or should I just keep looking for warrior tanks?
---
2. It was also my first time grouping with a warlock. What is protocol for healing when they drain all their health for mana? It costs me about 600 mana to fill them back up which is a lot, plus I don't want to be throwing out two Heals right when the fight starts and pull threat.
---
It's actually not ultra in the screenshot, it's just above "Low" ("Correct" in French). Ultra is very very transparent and I wanted the most opaque water for this screenshot :). I actually really like low myself.
---
There's a blue post from Aug 14 indicating that the key ring will be added in the 'first patch' after classic launch.  I think there've been several hotfix patches, but unsure whether it's been added or not yet as I don't have any keys yet b/c I'm slow-rolling my way to 60.
---
Pretty sure that was his point.
---
Not to be rude, but i hate people like you who spam invites and about "BIGGEST GUILD EVEER and i rulw them all!"
---
Swords have edges, axes have edges.  Yet neither are anywhere near as edgy as your comment.
---
Even as a DPS, it drives me to rage when people can't follow the GIANT SYMBOLS. It's like they roulette tab and whatever it lands on go ham.
---
Perfect.
---
There is no special BoP stuff, no.
---
I personally max out fishing on all characters, because you always stumble upon fishing nodes everywhere.
---
Mmh nope, warrior’s HP will likely be higher than a crit PoM pyro even if the mage is geared :) nice try though! Source: played mage in Nostalrius/LH/Northdale. Full AQ40/naxx gear
---
You know Saurfang was cool and all. But I really wanted to see the Horde Civil War. That could have been cool.
---
Which makes me sad because I love Arcane Missiles. I’m so used to using it in retail that when I made my gnome mage in Classic it just feels wrong not to throw one in.
---
Yeah. OP sounds 100% like a retail snowflake.
---
But why?
---
I cant wait to get a 1k crit on a player. Just got my first one on a mob today at level 50.
---
If he can't even read the talent description before making this thread then he's probably gonna be a shit rogue anyway. Nobody here is an asshole but if you want me to pick one I'll pick him for wasting everyone's time with a question my 7 year old could have probably figured out by reading the talent.
---
They are "underplayed" compared to the hunterfest that were vanilla servers back in the day. Nowadays people are more focused on endgame than on leveling and we know how hard they fall off in later tiers.
---
You're fine bro I dont think you need to reach out to blizzard. If you're worried that what your doing blurs the lines, just dont do it anymore.
---
Tbh i dont know,  i always used sgi with text only so i could talk to ppl and get to know them and know what they want and search a massguild will imo never last longer then a few months. You dont have to write blizz most ppl will tell you if they report you
---
We are family.
---
It is pre-raid BiS for a lot of classes, so you won't do better until getting raid gear. But there are other options which will be close and you don't really need to min max that much.
---
Overall 100g isn't that much and it's probably worth the few hours of grinding to get.
---
Hopefully we get a fully working neural link soon so that quadras can enjoy more freedom.
---
74kills and no luck

53 Mage. Is it worth it to have a set of spirit gear to swap out when I'm drinking? Is this an effective way to reduce down time when replenishing mana? Do people do this?
---
As in, 1-shot a mage of the same relative level and gear? Because that doesn't seem very likely since mages have access to: 
---
* Ice Armor
---
* Ice Barrier 
---
* Mana shield
---
MC gear isn't much better than 5 man gear. There's not going to be a gear gap until phase 3.
---
:D
---
~~I appreciate no one calling me out on the fact I can't spell release~~
---
Game down in EU for anyone else?
---
I shall avenge you by slaughtering a thousand gnomes ... and by that I mean I will end up getting camped by two guys 5 levels lower than me in Badlands.
---
Good job, jim!
---
Care to explain then?
---
Gold!
---
I've been having a lot of fun, and a lot better results, with frostbolting priority targets and then cone spam in near-melee range. Just slightly out of their shield bash range. I get to do a little bit of cleave, but not enough to pull threat off the tank. When you are the only Mage or even AoE in the group, it's the most optimal. 
---
Blizzard works great on 2-3 targets and all, but you will pull threat in a normal party, and multiple chaplains in a single pull will outheal a single Mage's Blizzard. Not to mention Diviners popping off Mana Burn the entire time. 
---
Spellcleave is great on its own and doesn't deserve the hate it's getting, but it's place is within a full spellcleave only. The hate should be focused on Mages who join and refuse to adapt to normal parties.
---
I'm 38, not sure exact /played and use a guide, but I also spend time doing professions and an RP event here n there, so /played time isn't really meaningful unless you are trying to be fast.  The guide I am using feels very efficient, I can't see myself being 38 without it, probably 32 ish
---
Perfect, thank you.
---
You just need to give in.  It’s better here.  Trust me.
---
If you want to drain tank, you usually need the Fel Concentration Talent from the Affliction tree - it reduces the chance of your spells to be delayed by attacks by 70% i believe, you you can just drain life while getting hit. 
---
At Level 20, Drain Life usually does a lot less damage than your wand though, especially if you're getting the Wand from the BFG Quest soon.
---
My advice would be to look at the resources shown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/)
---
Well that is the cool thing about Classic. The experience isn't entirely defined (for better or worse), which gives everyone a chance to enjoy it in their own way :)
---
For the last 5 years I been playing p-servers, so don't know allot about layers. But what I do know and how a feel about it all. If a guild members ask for a "New layer" we are abusing it. It's more or less how much you use it.
---
Ugh I'm doing the Barov Family Fortune quest and he says he'll "make me a wealthy man" if I get him all the deeds in Scholomance. The reward is like 1g. So disappointed
---
Hunters can roll nelf too for pvp racial.
---
There are many active alliance guilds on incendius. My guild just killed ragnaros last night and I feel like we were one of the slower ones on the server.
---
Dive has a great resource for this!

If you’re a mage maybe
---
This is so helpful! Thank you.
---
Swashbuckler shirts
---
Always used skull and cross as first/second targets. And they are pretty standard so no need to explain.
---
But, I always used square for tank, star for healer.
---
The rest were situational and explained on the go. At least in my experience, most of my dungeon/raids experience comes from legion where thigs were just autopilot.
---
Hey bud, just wanted to let you know I won the bet!
---
Well, I am not sure that deviating from the BiS-Lists is better ... that's why I am asking for input. :p
---
But, for MC and Ony it doesn't really matter that much anyways. For later raid content you definitely want to be as optimized as possible, especially if you are looking to do AQ40 or Naxx
---
This hasn't been my experience at all
---
hahahahaha very good, nothing but facts
---
sPElLcLeAvE
---
Look at the other two responses to the question and see what words that use that start with "res..."
---
I am talking about alliance rogues...
---
"On Reserve"
---
Love to be priest. Just whispering "healer" and get instant invites.
---
Couldn't agree more. It's simply not fun if you try to fulfill your tank role but fail miserably, because no matter how hard you try, as soon as your DPS start to cleave in the first 5 seconds there is just no way to produce enough threat on every target.
---
As a druid I just chose not to tank anymore, since I only get frustrated by not living up to my own expectations. I fear most warriors feel the same and it gets harder every day to find a tank.
---
But entering dungeons as healer isn't necessarily better since then I just watch others struggle or have to sit down and drink after every fight because I needed to heal the cleaving arms or bombing mage, constantly OOMing. Letting them die for educational reasons is not an option if you can't rezz.
---
If you /beg or /cry to a ganker you deserve to have your account deleted on the spot.
---
If you level first aid while leveling and don't go out of your way to not kill humanoids, you will have more than enough cloth of each type to get first aid up to 300. And with the current almost-vendor prices for cloth in the AH, it's dirt cheap to get it to your current level even if you start late.
---
Warlock here. Only heal me if you have mana to burn. Otherwise I can sort myself out. Also please don't heal me if I'm already eating.
---
Don't be afraid to announce in the General channel that you're looking to group up for quests.
---
Whisper/say/yell at passer bys in the area you are questing to ask to group up.
---
Solo leveling sucks once you're past the initial introductory zone(s). Some classes have it easier than others, so group up as much as you can.
---
Add the people you enjoy playing with, too.
---
Literally been seeing you guys are the new Huntards.
---
some options:
---
 \- run pug groups and note the people who you enjoy running with and ask them about their guilds
---
\- look on the wow forums for your server and look for posts - visit the guild websites or discords and see how active they are.   Many server forums have a well curated guild recruitment thread
---
\- see if your server has a server-wide discord - look there too
---
\- just try a guild and if it's not what you're looking for, let the guild know it's not working out and hop to another
---
Free xfers. At least in most cases that is the servers having the most problems atm. Ever since they were first added in retail, they have been causing major faction imbalance on pvp realms. Blizz had 14+ years of experience with this happening and did it anyway
---
It's low level poison mats which I tend to destroy. I do like the boxes and pots
---
C) Don't wait for the mage to drink to full, mage still top damage because his class is op and he has at least a half fonctionning brain.
---
Thank you for the response!
---
No trash hits that hard. The healer will be absolutely fine because everything dies so fast.
---
I say this as a healer who has been healing 2h tanks while leveling.
---
Join a guild. I’m a 29 mage and have run GY and Lib multiple times, never once doing that new AOE method
---
Sure. The true samaritan asks for nothing, but the dying man was even more rude.
---
True, can't wait to press blink into enemy and spam my arcane explosion bind so hard.
---
[It helps a lot that I can just go in game and snag screenshots for references](https://imgur.com/63cHbjI)
---
In vanilla you had to manage agro.  Dps always pulled agro.  This meant not attacking at time to let threat drop.
---
Seriously, this guy used his tools. The other two didn't use anything. Both hunters and warriors have tools for fighting mages.
---
*sees 2 enemies exactly*
---
Mage: this is where the fun begins
---
I think it was changed during the human model updates, not specific to this NPC.
---
Make sure thats what your tank wants you to do. Dont just start aoeing right off the bat. Some tanks dont like this new aoe meta and would rather mark and single target.
---
Well I am the "tank" in question (fury, full pre raid BiS at that point).
---
Scholo &amp; Strath are a little different, these take a lot more healing.
---
 Dont forget the lock running right up and hellfiring right at the start of the pull
---
Truer words have never been spoken!
---
Represent! You notice the queue has evaporated at peak hours this last week or so? So nice
---
I think people forget that 5 mobs with 5% health do the same damage as 5 mobs with 100% helps (not including debuffs of course) it is always better to focus down a target and reduce the numbers as quickly as possible.
---
If you can't give your guildies shit or even advice, then get the fuck out of that guild.
---
I need every reminder I can get... Getting old sux.
---
It’s still quite early in the game, if you’re already 60 then there were simply not very many people your level to attack you.
---
I averaged 8 to 10g per uldaman run. Plus the quest rewards if you grab all 6 or whatever. Little legwork not much if you set your hearth. Had my mount just after 44. Selling greens and blue bops that greed rolls won.
---
If you're looking for a more "old-fashioned" way of joining a guild, whenever you group up with good people make sure to add them to your friends list and ask them how their guild is. If it's a match for you, ask to join!
---
Another way would be to find their Discord. Look to see how social it is, that's usually a good indicator of how active guild members are with each other.
---
Perhaps you might just be into a guild just for it's large volume, because with that many people there HAS to be social interactions.
---
Hey, thats great :)
---
Yeah the +7 axes is huge to be honest since you dont get any %hit at 39.
---
No worries, I twinked a warrior at 39 and most of the gear is similar.
---
And a girlfriend cant do that?
---
I just find the whole "we need a ceremony and a legal document to prove our love for eachother" is lame af. Id rather be boyfriend and girlfriend forever :)
---
Well I'm horde and didnt think about duels.
---
Unless they get the jump on you it's GG. Once the warrior is poly'd he might as well go AFK.
---
This is why we need PVP trinkets badly. Mages are way too strong atm and its not your fault. 
---
My bubble (holy paladin) was down and a mage sheeped me and frost nova'd my warrior friend. Literally nothing we can do.
---
hmm, its definetly possible, vut need other approach) will do soon :)
---
Get this BFA shit out of my Classic.
---
What was so important about this specific fight to use it?
---
If it’s a red/skull Orc or Undead he’s killing my ass. I’ve met only obe exception lol
---
When was that? Cuz I remember MC40 having this or naxx40
---
You don't need more than 50% mana for 1 trash pull ever.
---
Also there is no such thing as progression dungeons, they are so undertuned it doesn't matter.
---
Your a dps? If so, that’s always been the struggle. What class are you?
---
CoC after Nova gives Shatter bonus
---
Huge problem, every other dungeon kind of problem lol. From all tanks, thank you.
---
On my Mage, every time I advertise a quick port from the city I'm in people always become dyslexic. 
---
"WTS Port from UC to Org"
---
Someone will whisper me saying they'll take one, then when I invite them they're in Org, expecting a port to UC. I always throw it out there when I'm in a city leveling professions or playing the AH, and it never fails. They always misread that shit. I offer sometimes to go and get them for 10s more and most of the time they just leave but one dude just said "you try scam me?" I only charge 40s for the port to begin with.
---
His rationale was that it counters more classes since there are more movement impairing abilities than there are hard CC
---
Don’t recognize this problem, had no problem getting a group while leveling my druid. Mage groups dont really need a tank so that whole thing did not make much sense.
---
You have to be there at like 5 in the morning though. In my experience.. I woke up at 7am to farm them and it was still taken.
---
I've been put on ignore twice so far in classic. 
---
First time I was just about to hand in the warrior wep quest after defeating the boss. Just before I could hand in another warrior accepted it so the NPC ran off be for i could get my sweet loot. As a joke o /w 'I was just about to hand in you bastard XD' = instant ignore :(.
---
2nd time I'm just about to finish a quest in a cave, need one more mob. Hunter invites me I accept. We kill the final mob i need; hes just arrived so I thank him and say bye. Next thing I know I get a string of whispers about quest etiquette and how I was honor bound to help him finish. I was put on ignore before I could make my case.
---
Don't know if this is unpopular or not, but I wish class sets were BIS for all classes.
---
Way back then, 8/8 was the dream!  I mean, you looked cool as fuck (for most.), everyone knew you were a bad ass... Turns out now that was totally flawed... Now my Warlock's better keeping some RNG rolled BoE green with +shadow damage, than wasting raid points on certain set pieces.
---
Death is the best form of cc!
---
if you're sticking in one zone, you're doing it wrong. As horde, between lvls 20 and 30, i hopped between the Barrens, Stonetalon, Ashenvale, Hilsbrad and Thousand Needles, never spending more than 2 levels in a zone before moving on, often returning back to the zone when I reached the appropriate level for the remaining quests i didn't do on the initial visit.
---
The number of neckbeards in this thread is just hilarious.
---
I find trying to be as efficient as possible incredibly enjoyable though
---
Shadow priest will do fine against a warrior as you can rage starve them with shield
---
Some people just want practice in different situations, or to test abilities, macros, hotkeys, or addons.  He probably didn’t care about the failures
---
longtime mage since vanilla here as well, I never liked the PoM/pyro since I like some back and forth in my pvp always found it a bit boring to just one shot people. Scorch spam is a fun fire alternative.
---
cant seem to find any mail shoulders from RFD looking around online. are they a quest reward?
---
Yeah I'm trying to catch some deviates here and the dwarves I see all the time will actually get up and move if I fish near them. If you're gunna fish the Barrens then be polite.
---
Swipe is my SHIT.
---
Yeah ive been doing that too when the quest is really really hard. My toon is mage so that makes some quests even harder to complete. Thanks for your info though. I guess im gonna try to finish the quests thats in same level as my toon.
---
I feel like I have to try this strategy moving forward, just in case.
---
Thanks :)
---
AQ40 and Naxx bis lists are cool as fuck! Hell yeah i'm not deviating from those.
---
Because going slow for no reason isn't very fun?
---
Because leveling is an overall shit experience and I'm only here for endgame?
---
Other classes outpace them in dps is what he means.
---
If the areas you have access to are becoming too difficult, go exploring.  There are a lot of zones that you can quest in at level 20, depending on faction.  It is worth it to take a break from questing/farming to wander the world and get flight points in other zones to make travel later on easier.  Zone hopping and taking quests that are green or yellow  rather than orange or red will help keep you from getting in over your head and frustrated.
---
It's garbage now and garbage later. It'll never be worth much so you might as well sell it now if you can.
---
PvP? Then it's Arms. 
---
You can tank all dungeon content and early raids without being deep prot.
---
It’s the same people who say WoW leveling is too easy and they don’t like it but when you tell them to take off their heirloom gear to make it hard and fun again.. they have an excuse as to why they can’t do that xD
---
The group of mages we had the first week doing 10 man SM caths were pretty chill. All of us were fairly good at our class and spent most of the time joking on discord. Made a good few friends during those runs :D
---
I mean this is the entire problem with rolling back 15 years of balance patches. Hopefully we can roll through the phases quickly and get a small balance patch to even shit up...
---
I leveled druid first before the priest that I intend to main because I wanted to learn how to tank.  Everyone just wanted to do the metacleave bullshit though and I never had an opportunity to learn the basics of tanking because no one seemed willing to tolerate going slow and deliberate.  Hit 60 without stepping foot in a dungeon after stockades.
---
Oh well, back to the priest I guess
---
There's a road sign in EPL pointing the way North to Quel'thalas, so yes.
---
Its primary horde.
---
Thanks for the info. I guess I don't see the Alliance death squads or just ignore them since they don't impact me. Just stepped foot into EPL for the first time yesterday and Darrowshire had a raid of Horde up to something. Anyway, I guess its all anecdotal. I really appreciate the response, ya Horde bastard.
---
https://www.geek.com/games/gamer-dies-after-playing-world-of-warcraft-for-19-hours-straight-1617225/
---
This is one article but you can find a couple googling it. Honestly not sure how spread it is or if it's only a couple person, but it's a couple too many imo.
---
It probably cost him like 2 gold in low level engineering consumables and the health pots he had from leveling.
---
Zzzzzz
---
Then, don't play those servers maybe? Your like parking your car in traffic, getting out to buy a smoothie, and having a little department store shop too while your at it.
---
Currently leveling a mage and did a run last night. I chatted "Let's agree now to all need on blue BOEs so there's no ninjaing."
---
Holy cow, you'd think I told them I was going to rob their house while they were asleep. "Why do we need to do that!?!? What's the problem?!!? Nobody is going to cause trouble, are **you** a ninja?!?!?"
---
Trying to prevent drama just increases it.
---
Seriously was doing like 400 dps when I got my WW axe with cleave
---
The unconvenient truth though is that you don't need any CC for the current content anyways. The only time CC is used is in the last UBRS room and there you only need 1 sheep max.
---
Scholo, Strat, LBRS, BRD etc. are all pretty much pulled and aoed from pack to pack and aren't much different than retail content.
---
I played Vanilla back in the day and we couldn't aoe packs in Scholo for sure, but with the 1.12 patch and nerfs to dungeons it's not a huge problem.
---
The content at 60 is trivially easy, I don't blame people for having the AoE mentality when it is the fastest way to gain loot.
---
Press the play button, or disregarding the warnibg, fast forward button.
---
Mod it maybe? Idk how to write macros but i know a little bit.
---
/cast ____
---
[mod shift] /cast ____ yell ___
---
Aha, ye I have suspected that most locks do it for a reason though it is annoying for a healer to see someone at low hp. :p
---
Do they benefit anything from being at low hp?
---
There isn't one and we intend to keep it that way xD. I play on the only rp(pve) us server and there tend to be alot of people who come in to check if out to see if it's similar to moon gaurd. Then they are disappointed it is not. However, during high population hours you will see a few low levels in goldshire trying to make it a thing. But it's not, so noooooo!
---
to flex on a 7 minute video, after they got world first rag on classic and keep building sub numbers
---
It's about playing it safe. What you described is amazing above 40 when grinding in the world because you can stay outside of the mobs' range while you Arcane Explosion.
---
In SM you don't have the mana nor the space for it. 
---
Usually you want the mages in nova standby to pre-cast their flamestrike for when the first nova connects, then CoC whenever mobs are frozen and it's up. Otherwiae stay outside of their range and blizzard away.
---
Depending on the situation. I carry both Ravager and the WW axe around. For big pulls I'll start with WW, let the tank get aggro, then swap for cleaves and whirlwinds.
---
I mean if newer players are trying to get the muscle memory and feel for aoeing then I don’t see the issue here. It’s still more efficient than killing 1 mob at a times, and I had to settle for 3 mobs at times due to there being so many other players leveling in the area I was in.
---
It's very good if you're going enhancement. I've got the full set and Ravager and I'm having a blast and can one shot most clothid
---
How do I effectively fuck up a pull from a same faction aoe farmer?
---
I feel like nova into FS CoC AE spam does more burst aoe dmg but I’m not entirely sure.
---
Probably bear druids. It seems pallies can be OK but but they aren't too common, bears seem to be easier to work with than warriors. Really it doesn't matter though, they are all good and if you go ham as a mage you will pull aggro regardless.
---
Become an engineer and you can  res every 30 minutes.
---
They're not. The meme is read from left to right.
---
Pretty sure that’s what every SM is like.... 😂😂😂😂
---
For threat? Perdition Blade probably yes, but I honestly doubt the others do and all of them are better in the hands of DPS.
---
But Im not deep enough into the math to make a point here.
---
Not in a dungeon though. That water is benefiting everyone, including the mage. That's part of your role as a mage. That's like a warrior wanting money to taunt.
---
Dps warrior is awfully fun and far far less stressful than being a tanking warrior hehe.
---
It is PvP
---
Sucks for him, good for you guys.
---
It's not true. There is a second hidden roll.
---
Finally a way for mages to easily level up !
---
The real statistic is figuring out what percentage of blue rolls end up with someone "needing" an item they don't actually need (agi cloak for a warrior? Give me a break)
---
If you think so
---
DON'T DOWN RANK BELOW 60!!!!!!
---
I went immediately after selling all my shit, setting auctions and putting things in bank after a 7 hour grind session to level. I didn't have any fucking time.
---
It’s likely that not a lot of people actually care about small things like this but there was a panel at blizzcon last year about how they spent days restoring the light color of one lamp in sentinel hill back to the original tint for “an authentic experience”. I’m a little surprised they were nitpicking to that extent and talking themselves up about it and then left something like this in the game.
---
Whats your resolution? There are graphics settings and advanced graphics settings as well, both in separate sections.
---
How dare you Blizzard!
---
Hahaha I was just discussing this with a group I was like throwing a tantrum the first time you lose a pbis is not really good for your long term rep and people will be running these dungeons forever and even more runs will be happening so why throw a fit over it. Needless to say in an lbrs/ubrs run with no mages we had archmage robes drop everyone greeds one by one until the last guy. I was thinking in my head don’t fry your rep for 50g dumbass he hits greed then won fair and square. I wasn’t mad doesn’t matter more will drop.
---
Switch to a bigger guild where you can run guild groups more frequently. The point of the game is socializing. Running guild groups on voice comms is where the fun is. Meeting and getting to know people.
---
As others mentioned, maybe focus on professions. Find something you like doing. Maybe that's farming for materials, crafting, and selling stuff or providing those items to guild mates to help out. I like a relaxing fishing session while watching movies.
---
The whole game is a grind, if you are counting on endgame raiding to save you, it's unlikely to work. Maybe MC feels fresh the first month or so, but try clearing it for a year to finally have the group have the items they want. Gearing is insanely slow when there are 40 people and a boss drops like 3 items. And in reality, most guilds will reclear MC every week for as long as the game and guild exists.
---
Last suggestion, pace yourself better. You dont need to play every day if you dont want to. Hop on a few days a week, talk to guildies, run a group dungeon, raid. The game isnt going anywhere, so play when you feel like it and do something else when you dont.
---
\&gt; 13 year old trying to be cool 
---
I don't see why a 13 yo would play wow classic. I can assure you the population is older than that
---
[Here's a video on leeway.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE&amp;feature=youtu.be) I know movement triggers leeway, but I am not 100% on backpedaling counting or not. If he's correct, then it would be ideal to backpedal away from nova'd mobs for a second until you are out of leeway range and then turn and finish running the rest of the distance.
---
I've personally completely forgotten about leeway until he brought it up and haven't been backpedaling, but I also so rarely find myself in a poor enough position where it would have helped me and prevented much damage. That being said, a lot of the time I am using Cone I am backpedalling anyway, which is also usually after a nova, so in a way I guess I have been unintentionally doing this.
---
Rogue for sure! So much fun, and the herb/alchemy potions will help your damage explode (as well as survive-ability)
---
I think classic+ people are a bit delusional, best case scenario - we get BC, BC is the classic plus, after all.
---
I used to use a word doc or a notepad to note people or my ignore list
---
Scammimg.
---
Leave. Take the transfer. Let these zerg servers sit out phase 2. 
---
They can't get honor without Alliance. Can't get gear without honor. It'll even affect their BWL progression, since they won't have access to some of the nice PvP gear. And it's no one's fault but their own. I'll enjoy watching them bitch on the forums, too.
---
i think i misread the latter part of your comment
---
But that one requires a pretty high level Eng skill to use.
---
You’re doing it backwards. The entire point of nova is for the +50% crit Chance. CoC first means no crit bonus.
---
Just wanting some fun set bonuses is all
---
Personally I’m in the other camp that respeccing should be cheaper - to a point. Perhaps scaling with the amount of points you respec rather than the number of times you respec. Mainly because I’m one of the people who went into Vanilla blind and I just like to experiment with different talent builds rather than blindly follow the “best” build. 
---
Why do you think it should be more expensive?
---
What class is the least represented at raids right now in your experience? I want to raid but I don't have the time/will to run a raid 50 times to get one drop.
---
You do. Thats why blizz isnt too fussed with it
---
Switch servers, 1-20 is easy, you could do it in a few hours
---
After i took a break from wow in like 08/09. I came back when some friends wanted to play. I had to recover my account as it was compromised. Oh my god what I found was insane. Thousands of gold. A mailbox full of gold and auction returns. And tons of mined minerals. The next week they kept trying to recover it back. I was getting foreign whispers. It was nuts. Both my buddies were twinked so hard  with all that cash.
---
If you macro /cancel form /cast form and have low latency, you're out of form for a split seconds so it's pretty rare to get caught.
---
It's so fast that the auras you get when in animal from will not re-apply, so you need to macro a /cancelaura for both before you cancel form.
---
do we know when DM releases yet?
---
I mean, most of Apes does get paid to play wow... by the government. Vote for yang or burnie so I can no life as hard as europeans please.
---
Yeah I find surprise blues when I solo because I'm not paying attention to loot.
---
Lol if ppl quit a PVP server because world PVP happened, they arent mature enough to be on a PVP server
---
Nah, druids it better imo.
---
For the love of all the things.... If you pull aggro run to the GD tank.  I think mages would get a lot more credit if more of us did this one thing..  Just run/blink to the tank and IB...  No more aggro run away, and blow things up again.
---
Because anyone that has decent food habits and exercise will not even be close to suffering from eating 400g chocolate one day.
---
Pretty sure lv50 is when you get another rank of growl, so that would sort your problem out.
---
I'm definitely not interested in the early talents on shadow to become the SW healing in a raid group. I think the disc tree is far superior for PvP.
---
I am now thinking 5/5 Holy specialisation and spiritual guidance is better on the whole than force of will
---
Something like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGsVVoZbxtcMbV
---
Ahhhhhh I need help!!!
---
It really depends on the group comp and level. My friends and I when leveling enjoyed going into dungeons at levels that most would consider too low level, and clearing them by being smart about pulls, cc, and threat.
---
there is no native "focus" functionality in Classic.  I believe there is an addon that replicates it called ClassicFocus, but I haven't tested it.
---
Atal'ai gloves?
---
Kodos have to be the coolest mounts in terms of adventuring companions. They're basically like a living Winnebago, you can load them up with barrels of snacks and all your personal camping luxuries and then cruise around Azeroth blocking other peoples view in traffic.
---
Enhancement shammies itemize more or less identically to warriors. Agi is great (crits for flurry), strength is nice(attack power), stam if you have anything left over  with a preference towards the heavier armor if at all possible (you face tank everything). You'll likely still have some leather mixed in.
---
My warrior friend's approach is find what armor you can while looking for good weapons.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/zulfarrak
---
I use classic wowhead to look for dungeon gear. Mouse over the ... at the top and choose instances&gt;dungeons. Each page highlights the unique loot for that dungeon so it's easy to pick through.
---
You a Buffalo Bills fan?
---
Next step: get some keybinds.
---
I pride myself on being a very resourceful warlock. Healthstone, Cannibalize, Band-aids, Pots. I use it all to keep things rolling.
---
I usually tell the healer that unless they see mobs on my face, I'm OK. I hurt myself to feel alive, but I'm not suicidal.
---
They do however have a seperate team that work on classic exclusively. I think they definitely get it and could do some decent work.
---
There are plenty of those in the game. My Tauren wears them all the time.
---
You are the king of absursity.
---
Here's the thing man I've been playing WoW for years and it's not like the classic experience is new for me. If the content is hard and requires CC and people paying attention I am fully capable of not breaking CC and watching threat, I'm not a shit player. But when the content is easy (as is the case in just about every leveling dungeon) and we can clear it more quickly by AoEing then I am sure as shit going ham even if I keep pulling aggro.
---
You pulled him into a dark alley....
---
Is the Orahil Staff better than the crescent staff from WC? I find it hard to justify swapping it, even if it's an item from 20 levels ago.
---
Re: #4 ... Back in Vanilla, I co-led a guild on an RP-PVP server, we used to seriously discriminate against shit names.  It was an RP-PVP server, so that gave us more justification for it, but the amount of people who got turned "Hey so it sounds like you'd be a perfect fit, but you're called GnomeKillerX.  So no, you can't join." 
---
It basically became an in-guild meme.  We'd deny guild applications, not invite to pugs, we'd purposefully gank the enemy faction if they had a shit name, then happily /wave at the remaining 'normal' names as we rode past.
---
Arena in its prime was great. Only issue is that its prime was fairly short lived.
---
SPELLCLEAVE BRO PLEASE BRO
---
I'd gank that all night.
---
There is also button that says "scan" right next to your money
---
So yeah, still 9% for most races... 8% is the exception not the rule.
---
If you need to be talked into playing perhaps the game is not for you.
---
No focus in classic.
---
Yeah you're definitely the ninja if you're needing ie a mail item as a cloth class over a mail wearer that can and will use it.
---
Super antisocial
---
If you're one of the guild's main tanks (warriors #1 and #2 in raids):  
---
Full prot early on. Maybe the fury/prot high threat build later ... but many builds won't be pushing the DPS to need that.   
---
If your guild isn't too tryhard, 31/5/15 will probably be fine.
---
If you tend to get spot #3 (the roleswapper):  
---
31/5/15 is optimal. But a full arms PvP spec will still be alright.
---
If you're 4th or 5th warrior:  
---
You're DPS 99% of the time, just go full PvP build.
---
You need dedicated tanking gear, dedicated DPS gear and dedicated PvP gear. There'll be some overlap between DPS and PvP sets, but they won't be identical.
---
Mages! I have a mage now at level 16. Having a good time so far. Just wondering if the overpopulation of mages has hindered your gameplay at all? I love dungeons and raids.I've been debating on rolling a warlock for this reason alone. Thanks in advance!
---
I feel like I should make the jump from desktop to gaming laptop so I can join the wife in the living room and travel to lans more efficiently, but I'm an old gamer stuck in my ways and having a desktop just feels right.
---
Plus Barrage and Rain of Fire
---
Ah man haha had this same thing happen to me and my friends. My brother was tanking deadmines as a prot warrior and rolled on the agility cape at the end. This rogue in our group FLIPPED out. Was cussing my brother calling him noob scrub and all kinds of names for rolling on the cape and winning the roll. I tried to explain to him that this is retail and agility is incredible for tanks. He proceeds to say "ya but who does agility benefit more? "
---
He then left the group and ignored us. It was very interesting to say the least. Doesn't seem like a lot of people have experience with classic.
---
Iv been fortunate as a holy paladin I always roll need on anything with intellect and spirit on it which is a vast
---
 Majority of cloth gear. 90% of the time I'm rolling against a priest mage or lock and haven't had any get upset yet. They usually understand that holy paladins are mostly in cloth gear cause it's next to impossible to find plate or mail gear with int on it.
---
Welcome to classic wow.
---
Hihi, Horde problems.
---
Jolly old Blackrock is right in front of our doorstep.
---
Ikr, the game's not even been out for a month and people bout to risk it for a fucking staff drop in ZF smdh
---
I just wish there was demand for consumables :/
---
Mobs dropping everyday use potions more than most people use them + raids being easy = effectively no consumable market.
---
Isn’t nova fs CoC ae spam more dps...
---
I ended up picking engineering for my warrior tank for purely aesthetic reasons. Dynamite is badass. What's a meta?
---
Yep: Unless mobs are on my face, let me do my thing. Though I understand the impulse to heal the half-health guy.
---
Thought this was discussing the first fight, my bad. Melee hit still applies
---
You're missing arcane blast I there too XD.
---
and now that they've burned their light of elune, time to all reroll for another one before the raid next week
---
The only good gnome is a dead one
---
Have you not seen the pics with orc males wearing chainmail hotpants?
---
But are you evil tho?
---
3840x2160 rendered down to 1920x1080
---
Hunter and warlock can farm Maraudon quite easily. The net gold from that is usually about 15-20g, plus you can sell runs for 15-20g, too.
---
On behalf of all mages: sorry.
---
I play like I used to, single target DPS, careful steeping, etc. I literally had a tank say “mage why aren’t you doing AoE” and then when I did, he got mad that I pulled aggro. OK THEN.
---
Wtf are you talking about? You're acting as if everyone in vanilla was nice to each other, but it always had its fair share of assholes. This has nothing to do with "the spirit of classic", this is just called being a decent human being.
---
For each point in strength you get 2 AP 
---
For each point in agility you get 1AP  and  1/20 of a % chance to dodge and crit
---
Soo your choices are 
---
20 AP
---
10 AP .5% crit and .5% dodge 
---
34 AP
---
Hope this helps!
---
You're doing it right. A lot of people don't realize they should have food on them for self-healing downtime. That being said we don't mind healing you it can just cause a ton of Agro and get us killed if we're not careful
---
Mages are the new huntards for sure. Constantly blowing their entire load before I'm finished rounding up the mobs, pulling all my aggro before I get a chance to even build it. And they go so hard they go oom mid fights. Drinking after every single pull. 
---
And coincidentally on the other hand, it seems that all the hunter players are fairly competent. Never has growl on, and if they do they immediately turn it off and apologize. Don't pull aggro, they focus my target.
---
I love having hunters in my group.
---
Strength &amp; Honor to you pal
---
This is some vintage monkeynews
---
I pretty much think any guide like this is doing a severe disservice for not mentioning SFK wolf.  
---
The real pet every hunter needs for group content is a wolf for Furious Howl.  And there's a good % that you are BM/MM starting out in raid -- which means your pet attack speed matters for keeping Frenzy up.   Only two Wolves have 1.2 Attack Speed -- Deathmaw which is like a 36hr rare spawn and SFK Slavering Worgs which you can train at level 18.  Which means if you don't train a Slavering Worg, you'll likely have an inferior Wolf later on.
---
Everybody leveling a hunter, IMO, should tame a Slavering Worg at level 18 and level it as you go.  After you level it, you then stable it for whatever pet you prefer, but you'll want a 60 wolf for 60 content.  
---
I recommend the following: SFK Wolf was my only pet until \~37. Then I got Broken Tooth.  Kept my 3rd slot free for taming new pets to learn abilities.  And then I'd level both Wolf/Cat.  At 56 get the Bloodaxe Worg from LBRS.  Train your SFK Wolf Bite 8 and Howl 4.  Then in Winterspring you can get max rank Prowl and Claw for your BT.  And blammo, you have the best PvE and PvP pets possible.
---
Then you can kinda do whatever for your 3rd. I use this slot for an Owl because I like how Owls look and screech is good for world content.  But the Owl will be gone once ZG comes out.
---
The most recent data puts it in the ballpark of 60/40 H:A which isn't great but not horribly imbalanced.
---
Everything the light touches, you can kill Dickba.
---
THE CIRCLEEEEE... THE CIRCLE OF GANK.
---
No, then you are in the wrong zone. All quests AND all mobs should be green or yellow at all times. Never orange. The additional hazzle to kill those is not worth the \~5% extra xp you get.
---
Chills
---
Have you considered picking up flight paths?
---
Can I use leatrix for plates as a stand-alone with normal UI?
---
Gotcha. So use to salt here I see it where it’s not.
---
Yeah, but i think it's where the problems started to show off - flying mounts, daily quests, endgame located in one area etc.
---
That was my attempt at telling him he’s an idiot for thinking I don’t understand an npc named DAISY is referencing daisy duke. 
---
Did the message come across?
---
I had a mage that wouldn't put up a port at the end of a dungeon. 
---
"i'm not going to waste money on you!"
---
Bitch, we wiped and I used Divine Intervention on the healer so that we wouldn't have to run back. It cost me a whole 18 silver and I didn't ask the group to pay me 3 silver each. 
---
Fuck mages. I'm a Paladin for a reason, and that reason is so I can fuck them in PvP.
---
Diaf
---
Is the 3 level rule to be 3 levels higher then the mobs?
---
No, it's in phase 2 but we don't have a release date for that yet. But they're only releasing 2 world bosses, Dm, honor (but no BGs) and (they've said previously but I don't trust them) removing layers so I'd guess in not too long. A few weeks maybe?
---
Which is big sad for me i was hoping for fast queues.. hopefully ranks will be server specific at least
---
Dad?
---
You forgot druids too. Throw up a Faerie Fire and Moonfire, put on some HoTs, and then sit in Bear Form and there's not much a rogue can do about it.
---
Spend more time actually getting flight paths
---
Context
---
Google how to take a proper screenshot during your 10 min flight.
---
Would do, but I am at work and it complicates it a bit.
---
Support 2000%
---
OP should just aim for bonebiter then yea?
---
Yeah, I haven’t even bothered to use cc on low level dungeons. If I single target I get screamed at for not using AoE. Shit is weird right now
---
I assume it's because all the old players remember hunter being the noob class, so now everybody avoids playing hunter.
---
Except the Heirloom gear is not that OP anymore. A lot of the difficulty is just not there when mobs have no mitigation or impactful abilities. Every class has huge AOE and self healing. The only way you could make it difficult is if you either did not use most of your abilities or you wore no gear at all.
---
Titan panel has an xp/hour/session and gold/hour/session. Very handy add on. You could reload before farming both and get your answer from the results.
---
try turning off your mic if you don’t plan on talking. a ton of feedback and clicking from your keys
---
A hunter will run you out of mana and you have zero recourse. No way to drink, no way to reach them and no way to keep up with the damage they deal.
---
SL locks are simply too tanky while being too efficient in their damage.
---
Mages burst much too hard. You can essentially never allow yourself to fall below ~2500 health or risk being oneshot inside a blanket silence.
---
Keep in mind that this is in high levels of gear at max level, and with players generally being much better than the average person. On your typical PvP server you can dunk on most people if you're better than them, but this goes for any class.
---

There are a few fish and related food that could sell well but the majority of the players aren't raid ready yet so they don't need raid consumables, so it is hard to sell them. Winter Squid sells really good when it is out of season. Doing dungeon runs and selling the junk is more reliable income than fishing right now. Checked the prices and many go-to fish are so not worth it now,  the economy is jut not ready for raid consumes, people are farming dungeons for BiS so they don't need it yet.  Get it to 300 and do other things for gold making for now. Azshara is heavily conteste you also need a lot of consumables to cap the zone to avoid getaways, above 400. You want a zone with a 305 cap an do wreckage fishing.
---
What you really mean is the standard miss chance is 8%, not that hit cap is 8%. You still need 9% hit on your gear to be hit capped.
---
You shouldn't unless you have VW out (for sac) or a Mage in the group. You are just killing yourself otherwise.
---
AoE DoTs will do so much damage. Try it.
---
WW Axe.
---
People are suggesting it because it is the best available option.
---
Go to STV, go north of Grom'gol along the beach, start killing trolls until you have 30 tusks. It will take a while, but its good xp and you'll get plenty of silk and grey items to make some coin.
---
Once you have 30, go to the AH, buy Lifesblood and the Charms, Thundering Charms were the most expensive of the three on my server, but that was a couple weeks ago. Total cost should be around 5-6g.
---
Once you have done this, go to the Hinterlands, do a /who and send a polite tell to people over level 42, ask them if they will help you kill a level 40 elite, tell them you will give them 1 or 2g. Don't spam them, just ask.
---
You'll have your WW axe in no time, it will last you until Uldaman at least, and possibly Mara.
---
I would love to see more tutorials from you. 😃
---
While that might (or might not) be true, depending on the class, the distinction is important. Because at some point most physical DPS classes pick up an item with +weapon skill ... so knowing that you then only need 8% might be important.
---
always, always, always put strongest (highest dmg) weapon into your mainhand.   
---
all of your damage abilities - such as Sinister, Backstab, etc. go off of percentage of your MAIN hand damage.   
---
Seek the fastest offhand possible for poison application procs. This is your offhand's primary purpose.  
---
Don't try to reinvent the wheel here - potentially billions of hours collectively in the rogue community. Follow what works. Focus on your movement, situational awareness, rotations, and things like that and worry less about being 'different' build or gear wise.
---
I have no clue what I'm doing but I make free bags so... A little bit of column A a little bit of column B?
---
Good for you. Personally I grew up in a married family and had the perfect upbringing and stable family. I’d like to have kids, and a stable family unit is paramount to raising children. That being said, I’ll definitely try and have the ceremony without the legality if possible. If not, a prenup will be drafted.
---
&gt; if no one is there 
---
This is not really helping, the place is crowded enough as it is :)
---
I only do this if the tank is being unnecessarily anal about ccing mobs. I had a group of like 58s-60s in the low level part of BRD and the tank literally put moons and squares on EVERY pack while also pulling one pack at a time, it was fucking torture.
---
The ol' "no installing third party software on work computers" policy? I hear ya, man. Got the same policy here lmao
---
well he’s dead how’s he gonna move??
---
I'm not trying to take away from this at ALL. But if this impresses you, you should consider watching a competitive strategy based esport like Dota 2. It has the spirit of this video but, uh... the game is actually designed entirely around team-versus-team strategic engagements. 
---
This was cool to see so many people coordinating together. But when I see people in this thread being pretty impressed on stuff like not using Sappers, you would seem to enjoy something like Dota a lot because that kind of strategy is the bare minimum and it gets much more complex and interesting beyond that.
---
what the hell...played so much back in the day and didn't know something so OP even exists !! So that's why they charged heedlessly into Horde being invulnerable ....That made things way easier and thats why it wasn't even a fight
---
be a rogue
---
If you have 305 weapon skill your hit cap is 6%, not 8%. This is because the equation to determine misses are different if you have more than 10 difference between weapon skill and defense skill, so at a difference of 10 you would use another equation than at a difference of 15.
---
I'm just confused why the same piece of gear that is skimpy on one isn't on the other is what I'm getting at, haha.
---
I feel like I prefer players to be the source of inconveniences, while the game environment should provide the occasional RNG good thing. I'm not sure I really want the game environment to add more inconvenience.
---
Trick 1
---
Dot up first mob. (dont use CoA when they die too fast.) 
---
After dotting you should be around 80% mana. Lifetap that to 99%
---
Continue with it. Use drain life and cast sb when nightfall procs.
---
In the end you wont "waste" mana except for the sb procs.
---
Which you can easily just drink after fight within a sec.
---
When you tap down to 30% youre doing something wrong. Dont use it 100times at the same time. Let it flow into your standard rotation.
---
Some people will be rude, others wont. That's life. Your issue is playing at prime playing hours and expecting to be able to do gathering professions. I started wow on 06 and even towards the end of vanilla had to play at off hours, mostly late overnight, to farm herbs to make money towards an epic mount. 
---
The issue you are seeing is going to get 10x worse when phase 2 hits and layers are gone. And when more people are max level.  I hit 60 early and have been farming my tail off, even doing late night sessions, just to amass whatever I can before the wave hits 60. At that point, I'll focus on instanced stuff, auction house, fishing...etc.
---
Ofc marriage can be used to show affection towards each other and a way to show love, but the most important part is the legal side of marriage. Specially covering economics and if you have kids. 
---
I mean, u can get married by just signing papers with each other. But sure, lots of the cultural norms adhering to marriage could be stripped away for those that don't like em.
---
What happens if I use Orb of Deception as a Night Elf Female?
---
Agility &gt; Strenght always and always will be because of 1st Crit -&gt; More DPS and more Armor. Cirt provides a better synergy with Windfury and with flury which makes leveling way easier with a 2H and you pretty much rollface Solo-Content but besides that mostly RockBiter ist more effective since it has sustain dps compared to WF because a proc is never guaranteed
---
I was lvling my priest back in 2005-2006 and healed all dungeons in shadow until lvl 60. I did same in Burning Crusade(healed Black Morass in shadow, however I had group full of guildies).
---
The wand gets less and less important the higher you get but until level  \~40 it will be your #1 in damage. At times it will be 70% of your total damage while solo questing.
---
Honestly the main reason I keep my felhunter out instead of succ, one spell lock and a lot of mages just panic and run away
---
If you already have two pure DPS and if you have the opportunity, you should bring a DPS druid with you into ANY dungeon. 
---
\- Won't do much damage but will most likely save your ass
---
\- Can off heal when the healer is oom / can innervate healer / can save the healer some mana by throwing a heal here and there
---
\- Can off tank if the tank is dead / can brez the tank or the healer
---
\- Won't provide big DPS numbers but brings so much utility 
---
\- Can dispel poisons which priests cannot
---
\- Druid buff is sweet. Especially if specced into it. 
---
\- Thorns help a bit your tank with aoe tanking. 
---
\- If not oomkin, will most likely never need a full regen. 
---
\- Faerie fire is a good debuff. 
---
\- Has an interrupt, two stuns, enrage dispel and a CC on beasts and drgons. 
---
\- Catboi is cute and runs fast : you'll never have to wait for a druid. 
---
I mean that's about everything. You'll never wipe with a competent Druid. You'll have all the utility in the world at the cost of 10 maybe 15% less DPS.
---
Wait, if you can play WoW on your computer then why can't you get puush or something?
---
Well shit I thought Americans were sleeping and Europeans at work/school, didn't think there was a good chance of it being Oceania.
---
Maybe she just didn't go back to town?
---
They said that paid transfers are the only micro transactions intended for classic.
---
(meaning they intend to give them to us some day).
---
However I expect we ill be deep into phase 2 or later before they open that up.
---
Please note that RP and Normal servers will never be able to transfer to PvP, but PvP can transfer to any type of server.
---
&gt;If you didnt actually play Vanilla WoW, your opinion on Classic does not matter.
---
This is Horde side, 90% of the time.
---
For the guys saying I should take a proper screenshot... I would, but reddit is blocked at the PC I play from. This was the easiest way to capture this. 
---
I'm sorry screenshot gods. Please forgive me.
---
A holy one sure, but a retidin?  That's all kinds of special.
---
Seriously classic+ is never going to happen because they will make just as much money for a faction of the cost with TBC then WotLK. 
---
If anything it'll eventually be WotLK+
---
As a mage who started playing wow roughly 3 weeks ago, i apologize for this.
---
Try 30mins elites and 30mins normal mobs, then compare the results and adapt
---
Its nifty even as a class that can heal itself. Saves mana and depending on your level, and level of first aid, can be a huge heal in a short period of time. 
---
I maxed it around lvl 35ish when I had probably 1400 HP. If I used a heavy rune cloth I could heal from 1hp to full in about 5 seconds. Even now at around 50 with 2.3kish HP that is a fast heal. Though I still typically use heavy silk since it is cost effective and still mana efficient.
---
Frost is just super convenient for leveling. I'm definitely respeccing to fire once I got 60 though.
---
I had to explain to someone that the jumper cables used to have a chance to kill the user.  Then that mining and enchanting were far better ways to make coin ingame.
---
Levelled almost all the way through dungeons and never encountered something like that.
---
Argent Dawn (Honored), Thorium Brotherhood (Friendly), and Timbermaw Hold (Friendly) have alchemy transmute recipes.
---
But he looked badass doing it. I've never seen a gnome and thought, "that's badass."
---
Yeah, but the base is still 9%, which is what everyone you’re concerned with in your post are referring to. It just seemed misleading the way you phrased yourself.
---
And I am sure you are one of them!
---
Spell cleavers don't even use a tank.
---
What addon is that for your bars?
---
&gt; Mmh nope, warrior’s HP will likely be higher than a crit PoM pyro even if the mage is geared
---
Well its a good thing mages can throw out two pyroblasts at once with pyro &gt; pom &gt; pyro then
---
&gt; :) nice try though!
---
This is some 2006 era angst lmao
---
&gt; Source: played mage in Nostalrius/LH/Northdale. Full AQ40/naxx gear
---
Yikes. Not only are private servers not accurate, classic doesn't even have naxx out yet.
---
You can go ahead and believe that, but your logic is faulty. Why should you force the mail wearer to equip it, when he might want to sell it now so he can buy a prebis slot?
---
Not only do you open yourself up to ninjas (objectively making it an inferior method), you're trying to dictate what people do with a tradeable item.
---
What if he already had a good slot there but wasn't wearing it? What if the mail wearer doesn't equip it and gets an upgrade later and you see it on the AH later? What if he wants to save it and sell it later?
---
Pretending that BoEs should be treated the same as bops and opening yourself up to ninja looting is not the norm, believe it or not.
---
Need BoEs. They are worth *literally exactly* the same to everyone.
---
If you think otherwise, that's fine, just don't go complaining that everyone on the server is a ninja looter because they didn't follow your inferior loot rule.
---
yeah that light of elune tho really made it all possible ..but its one use right ? So the next time there might actually be fight with that guild
---
Except now you gotta summon everyone lol!
---
Fair enough, I believe games are for fun and if the game is not fun then why bother playing?
---
That said, most of my time while leveling was pretty fun. I guess I'm wondering how I can maintain a positive experience with the game and stretch it out when things are becoming less interesting. Sometimes people have great insights on that. I want to enjoy the game and I've been wanting a game with a positive social experience for quite a long time, so I really want to see if I can make this click for me long-term.
---
Actually is it really a “meta”? As in “Most Effective Tactics Available”?
---
Maybe my level is a bit lower but it does seem like there’s no difference between an AoE group vs a traditional one overall.
---
There’s like mana, people messing up, needing to drink a lot, etc.
---
Herb alch is great. Engineering is also great. I leveled a paladin to 25 with engineering and I found that bombs and other gadgets came in handy while leveling. Little extra damage and stun, but you'll also craft some cool gear down the road. But with Alch you'll probably see faster gains.
---
It's the least useful city in the game both in terms of location and design. 
---
The bank and auctioneer are further apart than any other city. The inn is nowhere close to either or those things, nor is it close to the only mailbox in the entire city. The flight master isn't even inside the city, you have to leave it to leave the island.
---
In terms of location, all your high level dungeons are on the other continent and the boat outside the city only takes you to Darkshore. Putting your hearth in Ratchet would be better than Darnassus.
---
yeah I play horde and have had quite a few run ins with alliance, many of those being groups. Hell I had to stop questing in STV because a big alliance group was wiping out grom gol and I couldn't turn in my quests. whatever numbers advantage horde has over alliance hasn't seemed to matter much anywhere I go, because I mostly see alliance and they are pretty ruthless.
---
Course you did man, nice one! Enjoy your dinner!
---
Hmm. Here I was obtaining leather agi crit pieces that absolutely are pre raid BiS (no Str, either) and I got a lot of moaning too. Maybe the issue isn't the hunter thirst for gear, but the perception of what is hunter gear?
---
Evocation.
---
Reason why I dont have any other flight paths is because I was in rush and kinda went straight from Theramore to Feralas just to get Alchemy trained.
---
Get rid of remorseless it is pointless, and put two points into murder.
---
Light of elune makes you completely immune for 10 seconds.
---
TBF that guy is very good
---
Oh yeah, you are absolutely right and that makes a difference for raid-BiS gear. (I also forgot crit chance from talents ... oops)
---
So we are talking about ~20% crit chance in pre-raid BiS (including talents, but excluding buffs). For dagger rogues that would increase to ~25% crit. So you would rather easily surpass the crit cap for white attacks. I feel like we are getting closer to the answer. :)
---
There is plenty of good mail and leather armor for ele towards late game. It's not as good a true bis, but it's not like if it's not his its garbage and cant be worn.
---
Imagine thinking you invented Mage AoE Groups
---
really should roll a mage only for that!! its kinda funny
---
That's great! So not looting it prevents them from mining it too?
---
gg
---
Well, you could do it with two macros...
---
The first for Frostbolt:
---
/y Kamehame-
---
/cast Frostbolt
---
Then another for Fire Blast:
---
/y HA!
---
/cast Fire Blast
---
...you'd then want to time your Fire Blast correctly, as to not have to spam the 2nd macro and ruin the effect.
---
I looked him up but haven't found any videos of him one-shotting a mage. Do you have a direct link? 
---
I just can't see a geared warrior with buffs ever one-shotting a mage that also has similar gear and buffs due to how much damage mitigation is available with IA, MS and IB. 
---
Maybe a warrior one-shotting a low-level mage with crap gear but pretty much any class can one-shot if they have a large level and gear advantage.
---
Warrior is hard to say.  Like on DD at least it's the most popular horde class.  But many seem to want to be DPS so it feels like there still may be a tank shortage.
---
"What is my purpose?"
---
"You teach bite"
---
"Oh, my god."
---
Dwarf is superior for everything except raiding as Ret. As prot, you'll be tanking dungeons using primarily spell damage, so the extra weapon skill isn't necessary. Ret raiders basically need to roll human to have any chance at competing on the DPS meter, though.
---
Do whatever you want, and play how you want to. However, if you are trying to push the bar and be the literal best you possibly can, then you will have to wear cloth as ele. Even though shamans came ear mail, half the enhance BiS is leather.
---
Reserving is fine. "Reserving" by changing loot rules during combat is just plain stealing
---
I would love to see them go with horizontal progression for classic+ but i think Blizz should be hesitant to do so business wise. I honestly doubt it will hold the attention of most of the player base. I think people like vertical progression and getting stronger. Also your regardless of progression, releasing new zones allows them to more easily push the story forward and the rpg elements of the game, also most importantly a sales boost. Playerbase fragmentation is inevitable.
---
You might not be using high enough quality food. The better the quality food the happier they are. Also, allow them to finish eating. They can continue to eat after they have turned happy, which will keep them happier for longer.
---
Play it by ear then imho
---
Ahh I see English isn’t your first language. It isn’t mine either, but FYI 1 shot stands for literally: one shot, 1 shot , 1 spell, 1 hit :)
---
It's not bullshit, it's just optimizing the group for what they need.
---
It's better to get a group where 5 people need different things than a group where all 5 need one thing.
---
Creating or joining a run where there are reservations (clearly states at beginning of run) is entirely optional, and therefore completely fine.
---
First priority at this point is to get some levelling done. Sick of drawing him in the same gear :P
---
Quests, but the quests will outpace you. You'll want to get in either a couple dungeon runs or farm mobs to fill in those exp gaps.
---
Either him or Kamijou Touma
---
No it's in relation to the final boss.  If you're within 3 levels of the final boss then you're good.
---
Feels good being an orc using an axe :)
---
Yea how dare him do what he’s comfortable with. Tanks are the worst!
---
yeah dude i think i invented it
---
I vaguely recall there being some point in levelling where DPS of Blizzard is actually worth it, but it being a very narrow window. Improved Blizzard's slow effect is incredibly powerful for kiting, as well. 
---
But I'm sure I'm giving the mages doing this too much credit.
---
Nvidia GeForce has something that Works like Reshader, you can improve sharpness and clarity and it would make big difference!
---
If you need to ask such questions, then you probably don't have too much gold and should probably not buy it.
---
Sorry, but how is that different to what I said?
---
Ye, it's weird that only battle.net and any of its games work on our computers. Nothing else besides work stuff. Miracle.
---
Hit cap is 9% 
---
305 skill doesnt change that, it just adds 1% hit. Also that hit only applies to lvl 63 mobs if I'm not mistaken. If you are a human with an axe you still need 9%
---
stop talking
---
sad thing is I had like a couple hours last night to play and all I kept seeing was a group asking for "mage and tank and gtg". I was like ugh..ill just quest.
---
Until some floating wreckage appears, then you're getting bopped.
---
To reset an dungeon, everyone has to be outside the instance, then as party leader you right click your character portrait and select "Reset All Instances" The dungeon should then reset. To my knowledge you can't reset an instance with anyone still inside it.
---
What a clever way to make a veiled Classic+ post on the classic reddit lol.
---
Carrion birds are the best leveling pet imo since they also get screech but get more armor than owls. It's mostly about personal preference though. Any pet will start having a harder time towards the end of every set of 10 levels since it's been awhile since you got a new rank of growl.
---
Other faction can pvp you though, own faction has zero countermeasures. Just have to hope to be faster to skin. Against other faction you can fight to steal or fight to defend. There's a reason I abolish poison myself and skin in bear form.
---
Try tanking, you'll start hating mages too.
---
So long and thanks for all the fish.
---
If I’m going to wait 1.5 seconds for anything. It’s not to turn them into a sheep. It’s to begin a predictable bombardment of ranged attacks.
---
It's also because it hides your gear.
---
Why do some mages take 2/3 improved blizzard instead of the full 3? I’ve noticed them in aoe farm groups. Their blizzard ends up not refreshing the slow so the mobs break loose and wipe the party.
---
Interesting read, would love to read a bit more about the API and what blizzard makes available.
---
Well as a healer I want a Mage in my group.  Fuck paying for water.
---
I can't wait to go to Ashenvale and steal a Ghostsaber from the Alliance.
---
 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ghost\_Saber](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ghost_Saber)
---
Yes, PVE = alliance in classic. Paladins are just that good.
---
I mean, yesterday I pulled up behind a truck at a stop light with two stickers in his back window:
---
"I &lt;3 JUGS"
---
and
---
"I LOVE MIDGETS".
---
So there is someone out there for everyone in this world.
---
Played warrior in Classic.
---
Arms+a ton of stance dancing...and hope for that crit.
---
You know you need access to Dire Maul tho, right? 😂
---
Both the hunter and warrior played poorly. I have more sympathy for the warrior, though, because warrior vs frost mage is a miserable matchup 1v1. What tools does a warrior really have in that situation?
---
Single target frost mage ftw
---
Fuck Asmo
---
Just wait till you get clapped by a good one
---
Keyboard turning will have to do for now
---
Lvl 17. So close.
---
But 3k isn’t enough to 1 wombo a mage. I have 3420 hp, unbuffed, no barrier. 
---
Dps warriors Die from pyro + Pom’d pyro seemingly instantly if they don’t see the mage hardcasting. 
---
It’s that instantly part that makes it be a « omg 1 shot wtf ».
---
But you know, like you said, some people don’t understand English very well.
---
Doesn't the focus function exist, there just isn't a focus target frame by default?
---
I could spam OOM OOM in the chat... or a tank can look at my freaking visible mana bar! Those little jumps in mana means I’m drinking, not ‘let’s grab more mobs than I should!’
---
LET ME HAVE FUN WITH HOLY DPS ON OCCASION PLZ
---
can any female Nelf confirm that you actually turn into female version of undead and not male? reading comments here it says there was a bug with this item: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1973/orb-of-deception#comments
---
How so? I said that the actual hit you need is 8%, but 1% gets deducted if you are below 305 weapon skill. I am really not sure how my post is misleading.
---
Heal the group? If everyone is playing right you really should only be healing one person!
---
I remember in wotlk I would go mining deeply in the night (3am-ish) to ensure I am alone, but now being a responsible adult with a job only allows me to take a homeoffice a farm in the morning :D
---
Good point.  The auberdine and theramore boats both end up at menethil.
---
Have the name "Saurfang" on EU Gehennas server
---
Imagine being saurfang and seeing people kneel or cry infront of him for no reason? Must be confusing...
---
That doesnt make any sense. hes comparing a mage using arcane explosion to one using blizzard. The arcane explosion one doesnt win "because hes a mage"
---
Was wondering this too. How do i macro this: switch to 2h &gt; beserk stance &gt; whirlwind &gt; 1h+shield &gt; def stance.
---
Very high skillcap to be good though. You have to know your arsenal pretty well. Even in feral, you have to know when to be bear, cat, when to hot, when to root, FF, all that jazz.
---
You don’t HAVE to wear mail at 40. The stats are more important than the armor increase. There is no bonus for wearing the correct armor type
---
Maybe its just because I’m the one who makes the group when I want to run something, but I’ve almost never had a bad dungeon experience. I’ve had the occasional mage (because of course) telling me to speed up the pulls, when they’re still at 40% mana... but nothing too obnoxious.
---
Great suggestion. I’ll look it up now. I’m a macro noob.
---
I totally agree with you, with one exception.  I loathe when people roll for tiny upgrades with sub-optimal stats (e.g. a warlock rolling on something with a ton of spirit, or a healer rolling on +hit) just because it has like 1 or 2 more intellect than they currently have, and is therefore an upgrade.  I mean, if no one else needs it then absolutely go for it, but if you're only using half the stats on the item and a green could replace it 10 minutes later, don't take someone's BiS for the next 9 levels.
---
This won't work because focus doesn't exist.
---
Priest buddy is 60 already and hasn't swapped to holy until he gets a little more gold farmed and is ready for raiding... shadow is fine if the group doesn't suck and the priest is halfway decent.
---
Just give us dual spec. I know it didn't come until way after vanilla but just keep the talent trees exactly the same and let me unlock dual spec for 30g.
---
Then most people get to be happy except for maybe druids/paladins.
---
1 weapon damage = 5 str for warriors. The staff was loke 5 dps sbove my previous weapon. Tell me why i shouldnt be able to need om it.
---
Has anybody ever made an alt just for the purposes for economic play ( treating the ah like the stock market?! ) How successful were you and what addon do you recommend for the best outcome In profits 
---
Also do you recommend a crafting while doing it and last question is it possible to get max lvl crafting while staying in town
---
Because no one should fucking care about the length of some shorts on some NPC
---
Those lamps are everywhere
---
Because then cone of cold's slow won't be applied since they'll have an equal slow magnitude.
---
WPVP is real end game and the best part of classic and layering has damaged economies on insane scales. Your opinions suck.
---
Yeah looks like he could've been caught by surprise while eating hot soup
---
Sorry mate, i miss read nameplates is an in-game setting to get class color (might be required to download "AdvancedInterfaceOptions) and the debuffs above plates is WeakAuras2
---
If you don’t believe them, test it out for yourself.
---
I don't think they were in Vanilla, are they changing it?
---
Not really, was in rush just to get from Theramore to Feralas.
---
I mean, so far the WPvP is lackluster compared to some private servers. That is my only complaint so far. Right now everyone just runs right past each other while on pservers I found myself getting 1v1'd all the time out questing.
---
Good on you and long may it last.  I remember back in original Vanallia, the first time i quit was partly due to being sick of playing a vending machine.  It gets VERY tiresome, tipping wasn't a thing back then, you couldn't ask people to pay for some thing you got for free by clicking 1 button.  I couldn't stand in Orgrimmar for 30 secs without being begged for water.  It got to the point where I was refusing people stood next to me and I'm of the nicer type that will usually go out of my way to help others.
---
Take tips if I were you, the novolty will wear off.
---
I'm so surprised how well deadly blunderbuss did on my realm. Think I managed to sell around 2k of them
---
I let the feeding buff wear off before I feed him again. Do I need to wait to enter combat until after the feeding buff wears off?
---
A true piece of shit
---
Thorns threat is given to the person it is on. So if you put it on a healer they get additional aggro when attacked..
---
No, fury warrior is for single target melee after BWL.
---
I think they have 1 or 2 from NA that they played with on private servers.
---
How is this reply helpful?
---
* "It is because I say so."
---
* "It is because it is."
---
Which one is it?
---
Wasn't using Volley on single target a technique popularized by Kripparian? It's been so long since I've watched his wow videos, but I remember seeing him do that.
---
I have on my druid. I have had no issues with any mages yet. I pop enrage, demo roar, and mash swipe. I haven't had a single issue holding threat.
---
And when I play my mage (level 60 and pretty well geared), I never pull threat.
---
Sometimes I think this sub is just a lot of tanks who happen to be really bad.
---
SM Cath: Gauntlets of Divinity
---
RFD: Boar Champions Belt / Chest (The chest isnt really well optimized for enhance at all, I used a random green for quite some time even though I saw this drop)
---
Unfortunately ZF/Ulda is pretty dry for mail gear, so the next big dungeon for gear will be Maraudon(which has a ton of gear for enhance shammys; gloves/bracers/shoulders/ring/weapons/boots - Albino Crocscale Boots leather but have 20 agi).
---
You'll want to gear for as much Agi as you can, a lot of the mail around 40 is str/stam which is also fine.  Your stat priority while leveling should be: Agi&gt;Str&gt;Spirit&gt;Stam&gt;Int.
---
I never played Vanilla. I started in early TBC and it was still really great then. The game was challenging and fun. Server community and reputation amongst your server-mates was a thing. What I missed most were the pre-Cata zones/quests and the sense of community by not having cross-realm interaction. It's nice to have it back.
---
I thought you were a poser, Tips  ;)
---
nice breakdown
---
jumping around does help for snares because that half of a second before you land still has you going at full speed before you slow down when you land. it might be a way to get a hamstring in during pvp.
---
How are you using shadowburn? This is one thing I still need to look into as I just switched to sm/ruin the other day. 
---
Totally agree btw, while I miss not having to drink as often, my shadowbolts were critting like 1450 or something like that (also have very little gear, maybe one pre-bis and a bunch of middle-tier +shadow dmg). Also agree about grinding in the wild, shit I can hardly even handle 6-10 mobs without having to eat or drink, my numbers are probably closer to 4-6 D: I need to look more into sm/ruin though because I've only ever known drain tanking up till this point lol
---
20 seconds is rank 1. Think rank 3 is max and thats 40 seconds.
---
respec costs, AH fees, mount costs and repairs costs are needed to move currency out of the economy to control in game inflation. 
---
It may seem limiting to your experience but respec costs are probably one of the most effective gold sinks in the game and is very important to the economy.
---
Level 40 is huge for druids. Dire bear, Wolfshead helm, Innervate, basejumper cat form. But the best part is Hurricane. Finally I am on the AOE team.
---
Because the old school train of thought (which is what spawned WoW in the first place) was that you should heavily invest into a character. Being able to switch from a fully geared healer to a fully geared DPS, for example, was seen as too powerful and so the gold cost is to make it so you can switch but you can't constantly switch back and forth.
---
I'm not saying I really believe that but that was the design philosophy back then. They didn't want people to just be able to level a druid and then instantly switch between being able to tank, heal, or dps. The hybrid is supposed to be able to dip into their utility while in another spec but not freely become an uber dps or an uber healer just by visiting the trainer.
---
I've been Holy/Disc all the way, 15 years ago and now. It's tedious, at best and probably not worth the effort, but I just hate playing as Shadow...
---
Just go Shadow and save yourself some time. Also, stick with Shadow until 60 if you're questing, since at 50+ is when it gets the most tedious to quest as Holy/Disc.

Open all for AH cashbacks gives me a database error and I'm scared to lose gold. I'm not using that button.
---
I keep telling myself that, as a Druid. Travel form is *fine* for now.   
---
But man... dinging 40 with \~20g to my name was a bit of a bummer. I really *did* need that Wolfshead Helm, though ;)
---
check my other reply to the other dude asking the same question please.
---
You'll want to end up grinding Argent Dawn anyway for the resist shoulder enchants (and cheaper Naxx attunement later if you plan on doing that). In a later phase we'll get Zandalar tribe rep which will have more alchemy stuff.
---
I played shadow until level 30 then switched to holy to grind dungeons. I just found holy really boring when questing solo inbetween so I switched back.  Try it out and see if you enjoy it. But I would wait until you have your mount firat.
---
Glad I bought my for 50s in the first week!   
---
The main appeal will be how good the cosmetic effect is. It has no CD and lasts for 1hr. Not only that but it gives the horde access to all the human emotes and voice lines. Also back in Wotlk I was a Tauren DK... I used to use these so I could see around my characters fat ass while tanking. lol
---
Hellfire all day.
---
Stand in the fire, dps higher.
---
Perhaps, but it seems pretty clear just by Googling definition the word that "ganking" carries connotations of killing by underhanded means-- whether that be by ganging up on someone, killing lower level characters with a much higher level one, etc.
---
good to know.
---
How'd that one work?
---
I'd love something that just organized LFG requests into single groups and the dungeon they're running,  where I could whisper the group leader.  I just don't want to sift through thousands of repeating messages that happen in 4 different channels.
---
Don't touch what you can't afford.
---
Oh, okay I can get behind that.
---
Though it's usually a bit more complicated in practice than it theory.
---
Exactly. This dude is going nuts over being wrong. The definition of "shot" in this context is "attempt or try.*
---
Example: "I'll give it a shot!
---
Therefore, "one shot" refers to one attempt or one effort at killing an enemy. If the damage happens all at once, that's a one shot.
---
because tanking with 1h shield is fucking aids with all the mouthbreathing dds around 
---
you need to take more damage and do more damage to get any sort of threat going
---
If you're enhancement, the Ravager and Raging Berserker's Helm are very difficult to replace- you could easily be wearing the helmet as you approach level 60. Herod's Shoulder is almost, but not quite, as good.
---
Are you telling him to layer abuse? Lol classic Alliance
---
He needed on the same item twice, won it both times.
---
Im leveling holy. Holy is the best leveling experience a paladin has imo. And i HAVE done all 3
---
Yep, same with skinning.
---
&gt;Tiny fraction of chestpieces in the game show more skin on females than they do on males

That's what I've been doing. I got spirit tap first. But am grabbing wand specialization now then was going to head down the shadow tree.

Hmmm. Seems like he put it in the advert you admittedly didnt read?
---
It's not rude to leave a party.  One shitty pull like that and you can simply say you're not interested in wasting time &amp; money.
---
If you're specifically going for dungeon runs then it's not so bad. But most questing paladins are ret unless leveling in a group.

I've played all twink brackets and the 49 bracket is my favorite. I had a twink 49 warrior that I loved many years ago. I also had a twink enhancement shaman that was gimpy but a lot of fun with wind fury procs
---
Your inability to distinguish legitimate sentiment from (arguably unfunny) humor is depressing.
---
Also note that strength and ability will scale with Blessing of Kings (if you're ally) whereas AP will not.
---
Yeah definitely. Using aoe on large packs is what Blizzard is for. But having to use sheep and doing more than pressning a single button is way more interesting

Me (Level 42 orc warlock) I’m in STV. A level 34 gnome rogue named Orcslayer attacks me. My new nemesis. Killed on sight, no mercy.
---
That's not making money off alchemy though. That's making money off herbalism.
---
I do sell most of my herbs to be frank. The profit off making potions that are a hassle to sell with hair thin margins usually isn't worth my time compared to doing a quest that gives 5 gold + xp.
---
There is a Horde quest in Revantusk village in The Hinterlands that rewards a +25 Fishing pole.
---
Combat rogues and anyone picking up an item with at least +5 weapon skill later.
---
So technically the only classes that do not care about this information is hunter and feral druid. For rogues and warriors, this distinction might make a difference.
---
You don't even run into mana problems as a shadowpriest until endgame dungeons or if your dps is retarded, but then even a holy priest will go oom.
---
Resto Shaman here, It's worth it spending only 2 points in healing way? 
---
With 66% I can get the proc just spamming rank 1 healing wave and I would be able to keep it at 3 during the whole fight, with the other 3 free points in healing grace, it wouldn't be better?

Alchemy for phase 1 is the temporary fix to nonsense like this.

---
Mage here; lost not one but EIGHT (8) rolls on the ZF staff. 
---
I only said « gz »  each time, didn’t rage, didn’t quit the game.
---
Am I playing the wrong class?
---
I've got to say, the only time I've been actively engaged on Skeram is when I was farming dust devil's in Westfall at level 30. A group of level 20's rolled up and tried killing me but that is about it.
---
Take a break from reddit. You starting to sound like a parrot.
---
They still go oom, but instead of it taking 20 seconds, it takes 90.
---
These type of comments on posts about end game activities really need to die.
---
Maybe I'm not remembering correctly, but I thought not being able to roll crushing blows off the table was what made druid raid boss tanking rough? I remember them being pretty nice for offtanking adds with a specific set of gear (mostly blues) but still a gimmick.
---
Yeah I guess lmao
---
And they reset every Tuesday
---
So this was my experience in vanilla and I started fairly early but not at launch. I was a rogue so I was fairly familiar with the dps in my groups. If I got a double caster group pulls usually opened like this. People would poly or I would sap, and as the first dude was going down, they would start aoeing the pack. This wasn’t optimal nor super fast due to aggro problems but I remember this strategy being used a ton in dungeons. I was always big on keeping a damage meter and was a bit envious of the aoe damage. It’s super obvious the game is in a different state now. It’s not hard to find tanks and heals. And mages are overpopulated. I am a mage tho since I wanted something I could play a bit solo at 60. I wanted to play shaman but my friends rolled alliance.
---
I'm not using wand spec, but I have money to buy the best wand in my level. When my mana drops to 0, I feel the lack of wand spec. But I want to get shadowform directly @ 40. I'm a bit stubborn.
---
Thaoky is working on it. You can check the addon page on Curse yourself:
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/altoholic
---
I hope in a week or two we'll get a working Altoholic version for Classic.
---
How do you figure it's BiS? Aren't Umbral Crystal, Spirit of Aquementas, or even a Green with Shadow Wrath a better option?
---
1H melee wep?
---
Fury is less good at DPS and Soloing at lower levels. But better at tanking. It's a happy medium. Eventually at 60 and with hit gear Fury becomes better.
---
your taste in insults needs less subjectiveness
---
They're in for a ride awakening when they get to end game and they've been playing the game wrong in preparation for it the whole time. Have fun spamming frostbolt over and over again.
---
Yes. RP stands for "Rthe other servers were Pfull on launch"
---
Eerily similar to Eve online fleet command, specially the part where all members follow commands instead of "roughly" doing what's being told. Though they used the huge advantage that Light gives them, still beautiful to watch.
---
Well logically I believe you.
---
But it might be something else with me. I can’t explain it but I do understand it isn’t purely logical.
---
Hey just a heads up, the "classic" setting for water is not actually what it looked like in vanilla. Blizzard redid water in Cata and the low setting has never been reflective of what water was in vanilla. The texture and animation is slightly different, and the transparency is very different than how it was in vanilla especially around the shoreline. It really sucks because blizzard implies it used to look this crappy in vanilla by slapping it into the classic setting, but it didn't.
---
Why mage armor instead of frost armor?
---
Thanks again
---
It does, but unless you have a full party of mages doing so you'll get gibbed before anything dies, so it's safer to just Blizzard from a distance. Really you should limit AoE when not actually being in an AoE group. A CoC here and there is fine, as the tank will gradually build threat on all targets, but you should be careful to keep it to an amount that he can handle.
---
People, for the love of god, this is why professions have the tools that they do. Alchemy/Engineering can counter this stuff.
---
Hehe yeah pretty much xD
---
It is "not abusable" anymore. They put a CD on it. It is no bannable offense it is clever use of game mechanics as Long as it is used in the open world - and not dungeons/raids.
---
But yeah I did... I have never tried it myself since my Server is bae. But it may help OP actually. 
---
Still I would reroll as I said..
---
You can always only expect the worst of alliance scum... You are lucky I didn't tell him to buy a bot and come back in 2 weeks when he reached 60 xD
---
“You think you want it, but you don’t”
---
I also felt doubts going in, but I am so glad that the above statement was wrong. I have been feeling so much happiness each time I’m inconvenienced by classic. Like the first time I got ganked for the first time in like a decade by the NPC ally patrol south of crossroads. The whole corpse run back I was thinking “god damn that sucks! I love it!”
---
Are you opening your dungeon multi-mob rotation with Blizzard?

When using mage AoEs you want to make sure the tank has sufficient aggro first.  Often that means holding off any dps beyond a focused fire/frost bolt at the TANK's target until the tank has control of the mobs.  
---
Second, make sure you don't hit any CC'd targets - sheeps, sapped targets, rooted targets etc.  
---
Just watch where and when you're throwing that thing.  Blizzard is really powerful when you use self control to use it effectively.
---
Get Questie. It shows all available quests in a particular area so you can go get those you may be missing.
---
Pardon my ignorance, but why do I need to grind them for enchants if I'm not an enchanter? I would like to do progression raiding so I'll definitely get started on that.
---
I know about Zandalar, but not really something I can get started on.
---
Context?
---
Totems are sorta nullified by Polymorph, though. But hey, if you find a better way to deal with magi than I did then it’s just one more atleast neutral matchup for you. 
---
Warlocks either just don’t curse you, or only curse you during fears. Dispelling CoA is *not* an efficient use of your time while they’re spamming Searing Pain into you while their other dots are ticking.
---
Edit: also, shaman can’t remove curses. You’re thinking of druids. Shaman can remove poisons and diseases.
---
I wonder if they had the sequence wrong, because I changed it during combat once and it didn't take effect right away. (Helping a lowbie with a quest, changed the loot to 'free for all' so they could just loot everything, but did it while fighting the first mob. I still had to loot the first mob.)
---
You win... Take my upvote.
---
How for off the coast do fish nodes spawn? I’ve got water walking and I’d like to get away from the shoreline and avoid competition if possible.
---
No there's no established etiquette.
---
This my personal etiquette:
---
If someone is fighting to a node, hit it once for the skill up and move on. Don't tap the node to completion while the guy fights mobs, that's a dick move. But I'm gonna get my 1 skill up. If you want the 1 iron ore so badly whisper me and I'll give it to you.
---
If someone is already mining a node it's okay to hit it once for the skill up. The exception is stuff like Rich Thorium and Dark Iron, stuff that people mine specifically for the resources, not the skill ups. If someone is already mining a rich thorium vein I think it's scummy to start mining it with them, but I understand people who do it since there's a potential to grab a decent amount of gold. It's not quite stealing but it's about as close as you could get.
---
Literally is literally overused man, it literally doesn’t mean anything anymore. There’s literally 1000000000000 kids using this word literally every single day.
---
This is what I do too.  The raid frames have lots of great customisation built right into the game.  Class colors, move, scale, optional power bars, it's all right there.
---
Also you can't really compare Leatrix to ElvUI.  Leatrix does absolutely nothing whatsover when you install it.  You have to actually tell it to do what you want and Leatrix will do it.
---
ElvUI is completely different.  It does change everything because its a UI replacement, not a quality of life helper like Leatrix.  Besides that, Leatrix doesn't have the option to move party frames probably because most people use the raid frames which are movable without addons.  I used to love the faces on the default party frames but practicality took over from cute faces long ago.
---
Skull target one mob, enrage, charge, swipe on repeat. With a good party who can stay on target and you have an easy run.
---
My server is overrun with really really bad mages. Theres more people playing mage than any other class by a longshot and most of them are terrible.
---
The only groups with multiple wipes ive had are the “super fast aoe xp groups” theyre all bad.
---
Fair enough :)
---
Don't join groups that reserve items. Simple.
---
Okay so don’t get hostile with me lol. I’m saying that for certain class/specs (like feral Druid) it’s more than just vendor trash. Some weapons that classes CAN use are also vendor trash. That item is more important than vendor trash. So calm down
---
But there's a lot of people also sitting of stuff.
---
The best dps rotation is flame strike, Ice nova, cone of cold, then ae till death. Main talents are shatter and improved ae. Used this rotation from zf to brd and only works well with 4 mages 1 priest.
---
i said stop
---
please expand on this trick
---
I've been caught out before by being on mail page 2 even though I had opened everything in there. Thought nothing was coming through but just had to click the arrow to return to page 1. Worth a look as it's got me before, but if not, open a ticket.
---
Using that cone of cold to finish off a mob at 1hp instead of wanding and letting mana regen :P
---
We got it you get paid for promoting. Now stop.
---
0 skill reroll if you want upvotes
---
Ahh well, then its absolute dogshit yeah.
---
Yojamba?
---
He purged after his first white hit, watch closely
---
no German RP Servers! we need them!
---
Questing makes no sense and is all over the place  .
---
creepy as hell lol
---
Would islands have fish? I’d think that those would be less populated than shores because they can be a pain to swim to.
---
What is this aids of a font?
---
(Body)Pull mobs in to their aoe after they have used their control? Or don’t be an ass because they are doing something efficient and you aren’t, I’m not your boss.
---
Amazes me that there are already people walking around with thousands of gold even after getting their epic mounts. How have people been able to farm that much already?
---
yep, that was 100% unintentional.... but it is now a thing...
---
Personally, my main gear grinder is people that keep spamming the LFG channel, looking for UBRS/LBRS groups, whilst claiming X loot is reserved (reservations only count for guild runs, not random pugs)
---
Funnily enough, i make a note of these people, and monitor them every half hour, to an hour to see if they get a group together. Thankfully these people end up failing to net a full group, and log out after a couple hours of trying.
---
Missing eviscerate 5 times in a fucking row
---
Good healers will encourage locks to tap. Keeps the dps coming.
---
This is the first time horde has a assembled a big squad of people to contest their worldbuffs. They want to show dominance early to deter people from trying to stop them.
---
It is fair. I like the disc tree too, I just want to level as fast as I can without being a detriment to any parties I join up with along the way.
---
&gt;  the #1 pvp alliance in the game
---
oof
---
Lmfao shut the hell up pussy I thought it was funny
---
I had a blast playing enh in vanilla pvp, I had black dragon scale with the unstoppable force.
---
I put the circle over my dps that are being dick bags. Letting them know they should not reproduce.
---
People that actively refuse to group up for kill quests and then proceed to compete against other members of their own faction to complete the quests.
---
I swear I removed curses in vanilla, I definitely played a shaman. Oh well, don't mind me just going crazy over here lol
---
Are you playing on a 4k monitor? That might be why. Running the game at 1080p on a 4k monitor will make the image a bit blurrier.
---
A burning trashcan is better than bfa If you Count Out cinematics
---
I have seen them they have nothing to do with this specific set of armour though.
---
What are some good addons for druids who wish to both heal and tank; which do not meaningfully alter the look of the game. AKA, all the UI elements of the addon should feel like they belong in the stock UI.
---
Devour Magic returns mana to Felhunter, thats why
---
take up phone, photograph, email it, upload to imgur, print it out, fax it, scan it, break it down to binary, use morse code, reconstruct, upload to cloud, right click download, up load to facebook, post to reddit.
---
This is fantastic! Love the UI. Also the first clear-cut case for a 21:9 that I've seen. Looks fantastic.  
---
Tried to mimic it a little, but Plater was suuuuuper complicated so I kinda gave up. Might try again later!  
---
One quick question: what's controlling the colour saturation of everything? I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but the colour looks really washed out and desaturated, but in a fantastic way. I'd love to mimic it!
---
Look at other blue/green items of similar level and quality on AH, then look at the effect of the weapon (if any) and judge from there, see which class would benefit most and would they be willing to pay for it as much as you are asking at this point in game (not many alts yet). Also get atlasloot addon and see if dungeons have similar level items that could drive the price down even more. 
---
If the price and AH deposit doesn’t make you feel confident, advertise it on /2
---
Oh ok 
---
Well you can’t see both at the same time 
---
There are addons that show you all spawn points like gatherer
---
What I was asking was, how is the cap on Lockpicking determined?  Basically can I get to 300 at Lv35 (or whatever the profession requirement is for 300)?
---
Honestly at this point I want him to say "You think you do, but ( *pause* ) ... yea you actually do" as a little bit of a joke at this years' BlizzCon. It would be a funny jibe at his previous comment and also a statement that he, or the company in general really, was wrong to assume that. It certainly would help is reputation a bit and people would laugh at it too.
---
I did this with a rogue in vanilla - got to 60, farmed a few parts of the 0.5 set (I was very casual...), then rolled a priest, I think it was.
---
Ever since then with any MMO I've played, I've always gone for healers or tanks. Not because I enjoy them more, but because I want to feel "useful" in a dungeon, and get into groups quicker.
---
This time however, I've gone with a warlock. Got to level 19, caved in and started a shaman as well though
---
smolderweb
---
This is the first time I've ever seen this in action.   
---
Classic is my first tanking experience, and this is the exact opposite of how I normally pull,  but it looks freakin awesome and very in control the entire time.
---
I'd have done 3 or 4 separate pulls to clear this hallway.
---
It's easier to get into dungeons and raids with Mage than Warlock even with how many mages there are. Groups will always want more of them
---
Oh boy what a horrible idea.
---
I don't mind having vertical progression as long as they release content every 3-4 months. The problem in retail is that they take too long to release new content when you can get 4 epics in a day doing Mythic+. Then when the new raid comes you are already burned out because you stayed 3 months doing nothing.
---
Just release content, and don't stop.
---
Druids no being able to talk to npcs while shapeshifted
---
Dps is good, but you should opt for max possible damage - your abilities scale with that, only autoattacks benefit from dps :)
---
And sure, pacifism is nice, but you might as well kill them if they attack first!
---
THANK YOU HAVE A MARK OF THE WILD AND THORNS
---
I got it wrong, mostly because that's not what the opening lyrics are:
---
```
---
Naaaaaaaaants ingonyamaaaaaaa bagithi babaaa...
---
That's awesome!
---
Just sent you a trade offer with 4 x 16 slot bags, better get to work! ;)
---
Patience.
---
I really enjoyed the heavy breathing.
---
And gnomes are usually getting massacred by either faction.
---
Hopping zones just to level 'cause I dont wanna fight 2 level higher mops as a healer.
---
Yes but when I literally spam poly it there's really no excuse
---
The amount of mages that just take hits to the face to finish their blizzard channel is too damn high.
---
I can't believe there are that many bad mages. I guess they're new? Back in 2005 I didn't pull shit like this.
---
They did use it and say it openly, but it's not often used on warriors because their have shield wall anyway like you saw moo use.
---
As a warrior I’m all about this.
---
My main is on the server with the worst Alliance/Horde imbalance, I'm on the side that outnumbers the other, and world PvP is underwhelming as a result.
---
prot palas really arent as bad as people say
---
As a bonus - in raids you can spam greater blessings of kings to generate crapton of threat (kinda like a DIY taunt)
---
Yeah, Saurfang faked his own death only to run back through the dark portal to go straight back to Classic, where he is now posted up in Orgrimmar as an actual boss of an Orc who doesn't die so easily to an Undead girl with daggers.
---
I disapprove this mentality. Play the class that you like and make it work. It doesn't have to be the best for you to enjoy playing and obviously if what you want is balanced pvp where you don't have to invest time in anything there are MOBAs and FPS out there that will be a lot more enjoyable for you. Not trying to be mean, just stating the truth before you invest any time in classic.
---
I found a good group to farm our BIS items and now we log each day at the same time for 1-2 runs... The rest of my time i grind rep in argent dawn, fish or level/farm my alch.
---
I think a lot of people who are 60 already have tight groups. They never pug. They just rush to 60, then manage their character rather than playing 24.7.
---
BUT STILL IT'S IN THE TITLE AND I'M STILL ANGRY
---
I did yeah. Leveled my rogue to 60, 3/4 of the way to pre raid BIS, then got sick of spamming for groups waiting on tanks so I rolled a warr.
---
Got him to 33 though and couldn’t handle all the cleave/aoe groups at SM and was burned out from questing, so now I’m back to my rogue farming gold for fun.
---
Classic price: 50s
---
Retail price: 50k gold
---
Oh how I love transmog.
---
Hottest combo on Ashbringer and its cheap!
---
Not from what I’ve seen.
---
yeah you can get it, but i gotta rock the guild tabard, has more value to me, also i love the big boots, big gloves, and big shoulders, lol
---
&gt;i asked before if i could roll need
---
That's the thing.  Most of the warlocks willing to roll on spirit gear against a holy priest (or any other comparable scenario) aren't the kind of people that ask or even wait before clicking Need.
---
You're absolutely right that talking solves a lot issues and prevents drama.  It sounds like you're doing things right, so keep it up!
---
Did you change your name at level 48?
---
“ravager” tanks that are squishier than clothies. put a fuckin shield on pls.
---
I know this sounds crazy but I loved leveling in STV on a high pop PVP server.  The fights were amazing going back and forth holding Nesingwary - there's nothing else like it.
---
The sense of danger in that zone, the ganks, the factions being friendly (until they outnumber you), was so much fun and damn exciting.  I don't think that experience will be replicated again unless a lot of people start over again.
---
Ah yes, I too play on a PVP server (Bigglesworth actually).
---
I always forget what the +hit cap is @ lower levels in pvp...never really paid any mind to it tbh. Off topic, I have two pendulum of dooms waiting to be used or sold right now lol
---
They don't do that from what I know. And if they do, then Tsm absolutely does as well.
---
There's an unstuck button somewhere in the menu
---
You had time, it just wasn't a priority
---
30 mage and 26 warrior here :&lt;
---
How did it go with the gf playing?
---
I think the answer is no because mobs are gonna kill you while you try to level up your lockpicking skill. It works like any other profession, at some point you need to open higher level boxes to proc a level up.
---
It's not any more boring than classic tbh
---
Same. The thing I loved most was kiting things that can destroy any other class in a couple hits. The control, that's what I love, just toying with a terrifying creature that can absolutely kill you.
---
Are you finding ways how to solve your issue or just ranting?  
---
I am  feral druid who didnt know that at my level debuff gives 50 threat flat so i can outaggro first wave if blizzard.
---
LMAO I didn't expect that. 10/10
---
How do people even manage this. I have like 4 days played and it feels like I've done nothing else with my time. I've even been on leave for like 2 weeks. Do people just neglect bathing, shopping, meals, basic household chores. This is crazy
---
As a mage main now if you are a disc priest power infusing me I will love you forever
---
Damn lazy dwarf janitors....
---
Nothing to do with why the Male and female versions of this specific set of armour look so different.
---
Because people are fucking stupid lol
---
You're a great person and a better friend. Have fun out there.
---
&lt;3 this makes me overjoyed
---
FOOD!
---
whoever told you that lied to you
---
I've tanked in Arms spec since the start of my character and recently had to respec def to tank MC.  
---
I feel absolutely useless outside of Raids, Def spec is the worse.
---
Thankfully, none of them know about PoMPyro or kiting.
---
yep, i got the helm/shoulders/axe all within 3 runs, but the pants, made me also grab 3 more shoulders, and 4 helms, never another axe though
---
Theres nothing wrong with reserving loot in pugs, so long as the group is upfront and honest about it.
---
I've done a few pug runs where the leader wanted to reserve an item (admittedly not an item I could make use of) and I had no issue with it. Better than waiting around another hour for group :P
---
But they were stacked like idiots, and it worked really well. Outplayed
---
&gt;Single-target frostbolt DPS is king when you have &lt; 3 mobs in a group.
---
I don't think that's true a lot of the time. Arcane Explosion is often going to win on pure DPS at 2 mobs depending on spell ranks and +spell damage.
---
Except...
---
Rogues who can 2 shot them.
---
Hunters who can Viper Sting kite them,
---
Druids who are immune to their kit,
---
Warlocks who are immune to all magic basically,
---
Priests who can out survive their burst (just dispel out of any shatter combos), dispel their main survivability tool, burn their manam..whatever really,
---
Paladins who cant kill them but also shouldn't be able to die, and are also immune to poly (Blessing of Sacrifice) in group pvp and have BoF,
---
Shamans... a standard counter,
---
So... what ?
---
Vanilla is a very volatile game and almost every class can out skill another.
---
Hit 45 last night (about 65% till 46!)  on my shaman and just got The Rockpounder from uldaman!  I was planning to play the first month and see how it goes and probably take a break but I'll probably just continue to grind it out.  Want to hit 60 by mid-sept and start rolling the big boy dungeons.
---
Lolwut. You must have been way ahead of the leveling curve because I was attacked by horde 3 times in the span of a half-hour in Felwood last night alone. One was an orc hunter who was mad that I beat him to a quest mob. Poor bloke couldn't even break my shield before I killed him even though he had the drop on me. Next time I was just riding down the road and got a full row of DoTs from a 60 lock. Then further south down the road was a 4-man gank squad.
---
What cost 400 gold?
---
Should be fine until a few lvls before 60
---
&gt;For each point in strength you get 2 AP   
---
2.4 if he took Hear of the Wild
---
It is proven that they did 10mans. But so did a lot of other people and none was sure if it was even a bug. Consider the fact that dungeon leveling was never done on pservers due the bonus exp from dungeons wasn't added, how the hell are they supposed to know if the exp in raid was accurate or not?
---
As a level 55 priest with enchanting and tailoring, what reputations should I be grinding? 
---
I've noticed most of the high quality enchants from reps won't be released until phase 3. Should I be getting Waterlords rep for MC? Start grinding Thorium Brotherhood?
---
Attack EVERY alliance you see
---
Any change of files is bannable
---
I have raw healing figures but the graphs are far less interesting, especially when comparing greater heal ranks and heal ranks because they are parallel.  The difference between the healing provided by the spells remains the same for spells of the same cast time.
---
Yeah you can switch region in battlenet settings IIRC.
---
Lmfao agreed
---
Was going to roll a dwarf pally but the gear just looks so much better on a human xD. I bought the ceremonial leather outfit before I rolled a rogue. It was a must have!
---
I'm specced enhancement of though, so wouldn't that mean strength, stamina and agility are my priority?
---
As far as I know it’s fine, my friend here in Canada swaps back and forth between EU and NA accounts. Just was a different selection in the launcher?
---
But the ping definitely won’t be as good
---
It is level restricted. 150 rising skill needs lvl 60.
---
However. If you are alliance, you could grind the frostsaber reputation, and that 100% mount only requires 75 riding skill. How you are gonna get exhalted with them without reaching 60, I dunno :)
---
It’s totally preference. I personally didn’t have the patience to VW tank so I would pull aggro 5 sec in. Drain tanking allowed me to use my shadow bolt procs and still end a fight with full health. I didn’t find siphon life to be mama efficient whatsoever so I barely use it anymore.
---
This is what I like about WoW. Horde and Alliance are not mortal ”kill-on-sight” enemies. They’re just... different factions that happen to not trust each other a great deal and don’t mind murdering each other a little when no one is watching and it wont cause a political shitstorm. 
---
If you’re out questing alone and don’t wanna have a miserable experience, leaving the other faction be seems completely reasonable to me. They’ll leave you alone 90% of the time, sometimes you even work together. 
---
This guy probably spends a lot of time as a corpse.
---
If it's a tie the game does a secondary roll in the background. Sucks but it happens.
---
Absolutely, it often helps with immersion. It is after all a hostile world, and we are just adventurers. Taking up the scraps from the ones that we kill.
---
That’s funny I’m a warrior tank and have made a bunch of friends. They are all priests and holy pallys lol.
---
Well if the extra Horde on Skeram xferred off to Heartseeker you would have two balanced PvP servers with strong populations.
---
It might be flagged as suspicious but I wouldn’t worry about it. I travel abroad all the time and I have not experienced any problems.
---
I think he refers to the fact that many times you need to take the boat, you actually end up waiting but there he was lucky enough to arrive **with** the boat. Of course there are addons to time it more efficiently !
---
If your intention is to still play on EU with your EU account, you should be able to, you just can't play on US servers with an EU account because the game is region locked.
---
I would tell support that you're travelling, because there may be some alerts if you're going to connect to your account suddenly from a completely different IP, those alerts are usually in place to prevent account thefts.
---
Shoutout to "Hansfrode" on  Alliance, Sylvanas pvp EU back in the day. Eeeeeveryones Rich Purple Silk Shirt was made by Hansfrode 😁
---
Here man - I'm playing a rogue at 60 right now and I've had an end game rogue from vanilla and BC. Level combat swords. It's fun and actually does the job. People here so "oh it's so boring" are just reiterating someone else's post without actually doing it themselves , like a meme. If you want daggers, go sub - keep in mind this is harder to level - you will die way more than swords - and its solely a spec to gank others with while leveling which you can easily do as combat with a lower skill cap while you are learning the class.  Combat daggers is a viable leveling but you have to strafe and exploit the front facing back stab, doing this is going to hurt your hands to 60 with every mob.
---
Btw I leveled to play sub daggers at 60.
---
Glad you enjoy it so much too :D
---
why does anyone really care about what these beanbags do? I mean they stream on twitch (ive watched it) and not a one of them has a bit of personality or entertainment value. Reminds me of the old Elitist Jerks guild from Vanilla.   
---
Why so many bow down to the altar of their collective anuses really boggles the mind.
---
just to be sure: They're kidding :P
---
That’s the model ID dropped into Elwynn forest
---
This right here exactly
---
&gt;if i just wait for a couple conc ticks.
---
Ain't nobody got time for that
---
I agree with you in your abstract ideas, but thunderclap only generates its damage in threat, and does piss-poor damage. Thunderclap is only a mitigation spell (slower autos) if you even press it at all, and I usually don’t.
---
They should have kept this.
---
Omg, 23 mage and 28 warrior here. Looks like we have a trend of "I will do it myself" :)
---
Both the disc/shadow and mostly shadow build will be just fine. Wand spec and spirit tap are the important parts anyway before lvl 40 so if you get does you can't mess it up.
---
I can have 3 mages in my group and still not get AI as a healer, and this is at 60 when they can buff the entire group.
---
I think you only have to change the font at the wow folders 
---
Search this font type, dload it and put it in the folder
---
Truefaith recipe + mats. I only had 2 Mooncloth that i had made myself, so I had to buy the rest.
---
So what? Scaling is a thing buddy. Pservers were able to run servers with twice the pop of a blizzard realm with no lag on 400 people spamming aoe abilities. There's no excuse for blizzard performance.
---
+str and agi.  
---
10 str will give you 24 AP already. Add +10 from agi - and you already at the point break, without counting in crit and dodge.
---
from a mana efficency standard I still don't quite understand the necessity to use every rank of heal.  
---
your graph is sort of inaccurate though because you can't start @ a zero sum for a spell.  The mana per HP for each ability should start at 2.1 for Heal rank 1 and at 2.9 for Greater Heal rank 5.  Your hockey stick effect on the Heal rank 1 is incorrect also 
---
HP per mana point with +400 healing is around 2.3 for heal rank 1 and 3.1 for Greater Heal rank  5 
---
So from the numbers I have looked at Heal does not break 3 HP per MP.  But Greater heal ranks 3, 4, and 5 do.  Greater Heal is more mana efficent and IMO using downranked greater heal is superior to using Heal at all.  If someone doesn't have enough dmg on them to use Greater Heal rank 3 then they get a shield and/or a renew depending on situation.
---
Sunder is not just a threat mechanic, but a timing communication mechanic.
---
That is why the "standard" is to wait for 5 Sunders. It allows the tank to have good threat, keep good threat, and doesn't require any specific action on the tank's part other than doing his job.
---
remindME! 1 year “how’s hunter presence/meters looking in classic raids”
---
Back to STV, or do cath, RFD, etc. Dustwallow is meh but can be done. Til you can hit up Tanaris around 43. You may also wanna go to Feralas at 41 ish and get yourself to 43 off the basix quests there. Actually, even green quests in Desolace (or in general) are really solid surprisingly. Still, grinding mobs or dungeons is critical. Kill extra mobs and just enjoy the extra loot. It's a must imo. Quests just guide you to the grinding spots honestly. They're not the end all, be all.
---
I switched from PvE to PvP in vanilla. Best decision I ever made. It took a while to get used to, but after a while you start to appreciate the added sense of danger a PVP server provides. It makes the world feel more alive and immersive. Plus, the world PVP faction battles are awe-inspiring.
---
Priest :-(
---
&gt; Once we get PvP trinket, things get interesting
---
This is the only thing that keeps me going. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve thought “I could’ve won this if I had my pvp trinket”
---
The idea is to weave life tap and dark part into your rotation to keep your health &lt;100% to make best use of demon armor and keep your pets mana &lt;100% to take advantage of their fast regeneration.
---
Yeah same as a mob they can't do anything to it while you are looting it.
---
druid tank (45 now) who also leveled exclusively via dungeon diving (were a rare and superior breed), and nothing makes the runs more exciting and downright lethal then pulling WAY more then you should, forcing everyone to kick their game up and bring it
---
its really all about communication and getting everyone on the same page, whether you are keeping pulls short and quick or the explaining you require extra time to score aggro and group a shit ton of mobs up
---
consistently have been able to pull groups of 10+ starting with SM - Arm up to Uldaman..  merely state at the start of the run to NOT dps and give me a few extra seconds to position the mobs for them to decimate and rain down hell
---
while I prefer the route of efficiency, it entirely depends on the make up of the group.. if were lacking AOE, guess what you keep the pulls a little shorter and burn mobs down nearly as FAST. no denying its a little slower (an extra \~5 minutes is a non-factor), but ill happily take competent dps who understands aggro/cc/kill order even more so if they are active in chat
---
strategy seems to be working as Im constantly whispered by healers/dps previously grouped with. not to mention have received 30-50 guild invites
---
400g to buy the recipe and mats for the robe.

Time and MONEY?
---
Cause sometimes it's fun to be a ninja or a pirate and have your voice/emotes change. I always keep a stack of these on my char for when I get bored in a party.
---
ITT “reeeeeee es jay wus”
---
The hunter had more tools at his disposal that he potentially could’ve used. For example pet stun to force blink or iceblock and feign death to cancel the mages’s frostbolt into CoC or fireblast. If he could’ve prevented dieing so fast to the shatter combo this could’ve been a closer fight.
---
You're a saint.
---
Damn, thanks the time you took to answer tough
---
Man, whats with them and all caps lol?  Never heard of any of them what servers are they on?
---
How have they still not fixed this?
---
Or you could have a good pally tank hold all aoe threat and you can do your dos without having to run away and kite
---
58 hunter on Zandalar Tribe, we are incredible short on tanks and have way too many dps and healers,  yet I decided to create shaman healer, tanks feel like a hard job to do :-P
---
I feel like everyone on my server has this new mindset. Healers LFG everywhere!
---
It's probably because of PvP.
---
But I agree, Holy feels better.
---
Yellow hitcap goes from 9% to 6% at 305 skill.
---
You have the weirdest keybinds I’ve seen. No numbers just remapping by the letters. Do you not use auto shot?
---
Do you have any videos of this, most grand scale battles i see footage off everyones spiking about.
---
Is this some sort of DPS joke us tanks won’t understand?
---
Well it works great /Mage
---
Crowdfunded server run by a alcoholic norwegian hosted on a 3rd party platform running smoother than blizzard servers with 2x the server pops and no layering omega lul
---
I think I'm feeling a bagel with my coffee.
---
The over-exaggerated spell batching has allowed me trade killing blows with a mob I’m ip to 6 times now... we both died?!
---
....warlocks immune the magic? What game are you playing?
---
You my friend, needed to get more vitamins during childhood. Quite clearly lacking developmentally.
---
Nice try but your formula is just wrong buddy. sorry
---
While we're at it then - anyone know this font?
---
Seems to be the same with hunters.
---
The advantage of being a tank and in higher demand than other roles.
---
Way cool. And on the same server as the missus and i :D
---
Grizzly just straight salivating at this.
---
This sounds right. 0.7 might have been TBC with the talents.
---
Yeah I see that haha but my friends and I have all played since tbc and everything after moon has to be communicated in text/voice since it's not used very often.
---
I feel like joining the LookingForGroup chat might help your efforts a little when getting your party together. I'm level 50 and I'm currently trying to figure out a way I can get my GF out of the house for 3 hours so I can do a full Mara run without being nagged. Grats on your personal victory.
---
Can’t trust these other noobs to do it for me ;)
---
go beartank! it's fun and you get groups where the warriors and mages don't compete with your loot.
---
This has also been my experience. I mark skull and about 1/3 chance it dies last and I'm thinking, why am I even here?
---
Some tips..
---
- drink immediately every single time you leave combat, even if it's just for a tick or two
---
- mage armor in dungeons
---
- AoE with more mana efficient spells like Blizz instead of AE
---
- talents like the one that reduces mana costs in Frost or clearcasting in Arcane will help
---
- don't be afraid to use Evocation whenever it's up
---
- go to the AH and keep 10 greater mana potions on you. A stack of 5 is only 1g on my server and I use them judiciously 
---
- use your mana crystals for those boss fights or tricky pulls
---
- frostbolt if it's 3 or less mobs
---
Even if you do all the above, you will still go oom lol. But it gets a little better with gear.

---
There's a huge gap between Gravestone Scepter and any noticeable upgrade. Around 40 you can start to get a small upgrade. I would look into getting the Gnomish Zapper in Arathi Highlands from Sunken Treasure, or just wait a level and buy the Blackbone Wand from a vendor (the DPS is actually better).
---
Can't be a pvp server if it skews ally
---
Which iten is it?
---
I dare you to try PoM pyro. It's not nearly as good as people complaining make it seem.
---
A shame you aren't enjoying it.  Any things special that don't float your boat?
---
The only stat that affects wands is getting crit chance from agility.
---
Really? What other items?
---
No the bad patch was 2, not 12. The armor scaling is good and druids are working fine.
---
Spell reflection makes a huge difference in a mage vs warrior fight huh?
---
4g is good for the level.  You’re on the right track for buying your mount at 40 for sure.
---
Shadow priest is a god tier 1v1 dueler (only thing in the game that beats you is shaman), but fights are hardly ever a straight up 1v1. With no mobility or escape you're vulnerable to getting teamed on and can't start a fight that the other player doesn't want to take.  
---
Druid you have mobility, stealth, CC and an escape, which I think makes the world PvP experience a lot better all things considered. 
---
For battlegrounds neither class is that great so have your pick
---
Thanks a lot. Btw: Orc or Tauren for ele pvp? Usually ppl say orc because of sturn ressist. But war stomp is good for self heal? Any experience?
---
Ole dodgy
---
Moonmoon did that the other day and it became such a warzone
---
To be fair, it's not the seller's responsibility to cover your mat cost if the cloak is trash, though he probably didn't know it was a quest item and you were charging mostly for convenience.
---
i found that the smoothest runs are often the ones with only melee tbh 
---
even packs that typically make me think aoe would be nice here are somehow often smoother with full melee 
---
the 1 mage that spams aoe will usually just make everything chaotic and really messy
---
Only if you are using non sword/mace. They are not worth it for sword.
---
Awesome thank you very much! I am enhancement so this is so useful!
---
I always tip if I am seeking out and asking a mage for a portal.  But for the end of a dungeon, I don't think it is necessary.
---
You should have no problems with groups all the way to 60 and beyond
---
I got my SFK wolf asap, but haven't touched him since I tamed BT at 37. I now have 60 BT and 60 bloodaxe (1.5AS). Would you say the 0.3sec faster AS is worth going back to level my SFK wolf?
---
Mages are OP because the people going up against them don't know how to deal with them.
---
They're glass cannons. Every class has some way to handle them, but you have to be quick or you're dead.
---
Except maybe warrior? That's a tougher matchup vs mage unless you have engineering and/or free action pots.
---
Is that glass full of water or tears?
---
I like seeing those guys spam in LFG for like hours trying to find spellcleave or w/e specific class they need. Meanwhile I have gained a level or two doing quests.. few days later Ill be X levels higher and pushing on with my thing and there still looking for some mage with Imp Blizzard for Cath or ZF graves. 
---
Stuff your Xp/Hour when 3 hours of that is spamming LFG.
---
Thank God,  osrs but wow would be awesome
---
Huh. Is there somewhere i can easily check the major guilss on each server?
---
Why not message an officer in that guild? If they don’t want that kind of behavior they can’t fix it if no one says anything.
---
Lack of paid transfers really sucks for the average player in my opinion. I respect that others think differently. 
---
 It's a cool thing for the hardcore players that have time too reroll but for casual players with limited time it's extremely demotivating. 
---
People can't switch to play with their friends because they don't have the time to catch up. It's been a huge problem in my friend groups since alot of us have time consuming careers or/kids. It's been a real bummer.
---
Without getting into the numbers of it, there are severe diminishing returns on anything beyond +8 weapon skill. The +5 from being a human is the bulk of it, and most people would say you would be better off selling the item to another player that doesn’t have a bonus racial weapon skill.
---
Ret is actually decently strong in PvP. In PvE/Raids however it is among the weakest of the meme specs. People will tell you its about utility but the cold hard truth is it brings 0 utility that a holy pally doesn't already bring. You can dedicate a Ret to being a nightfall swinger but its still better to just give that job to an offtank.
---
That said, you don't need to be in optimal specs to raid vanilla, so if you really want to commit to it and you find a group willing to take you, you won't stop a raid from clearing content.
---
Tnak plz?!
---
Actually mage buff is expensive, costs 25% of their mana. Buffing the whole group requires drinking twice. 
---
As a mage who doesn't like to rush it's really annoying. I'll buff the whole group and tell them to watch my mana while I buff. They see me go oom and proceed to pull when I'm done buffing with zero mana and one person still unbuffed. 
---
Doesn't mean a mage shouldn't buff someone at all, and charging a group member for water definitely makes him a shitty mage, but I'm just saying... That buff DOES cost that much mana.
---
Also, the summarize, most people stick to the default (Pet, DoT, Wand) until drain level 5 at level 46. That's around the point it really feels good and you have the talents for it all.  
---
Before can feel clunky.
---
23 mage who went Warrior, stopped at 20 and rerolled again, this time  shaman because then i can smash shit solo and still get invited to a group instantly as a shitty healer
---
No ty
---
No one is complaining about breaking CC in these situations, by all means rage away. I only sheep what the tank marks or casters on the outskirts of the melee.
---
Never be not flexing as they say
---
Thanks ! :)
---
When I jumped down the elevators in thousand needles, I went along the wall and then went on the road a bit later, so there's a chance I couldn't even see the flight master there. Not sure.
---
I love your constructive criticism. I never would have thought of that. Even in a victory like this, feedback should always be welcomed and heard. ✌️
---
Source? Because I read a blue post that said it's 9%.
---
Rogues want cooking to make Thistle Tea.
---
Yeah haha 😂 Hopefully it'll drop a bit slower when I get dire bear form. May try and get some feral weapons like staff of Jordan in the future to do weapon swaps while shifting too
---
Obviously you're used to having things in the backside.....that fence post is big
---
Warlocks are usually underserved. Need those summons.
---
They do. One of the guilds there is Dreamstate. Roughly equivalent to APES.
---
Even if you're going down the power creep route you can only really go so far before you have capped everything but Attack or spell power. Eventually you hit a cap on things like crit not to mention exceptionally high values in things like crit can have weird consequences in gameplay mechanics.
---
A second issue is that you can only go on so long expanding the game that way with no resets before the game feels inaccessible to people If there are no catch up mechanics. 3 raids deep worth of progression is fine, but what happens when you get 6 deep or 9 deep? But then if you add catch up mechanics that has it's own problems that I think we have seen in spades in retail.
---
 What to do after naxx is not a problem with an easy solution
---
I’m level 44, am I too low for ZF? I’ve been declined twice for a group from the LFG chat saying I was too low.
---
I don't agree. I have tried old games before and they often feel clunky and dated, and look dated.  While others remain good. 
---
Tbh 150 hours in a short span, specially on a game you know from before will likely induce a burnout. 
---
I am quite sure i would enjoy the jeepers out of Classic without having it played before as well.
---
Huh, rolles blaumeaux with a couple rl friends. Guess i got a fairly balanced server. Was wondering about that
---
😂👉🦁
---
This post is about unpopular opinions, not opinions from neckbeards..
---
Oh that looks fine. It's just fps lag
---
You might need to take another look at the graph and what the axis define.  X-axis is healing power y-axis is mana efficency.  At 0 healing power (which yes is 100% possible) the mana effenciency is given.  Not sure what you mean about hockey stick as all the lines are linear can you clarify that?  Greater heal rank 5 isn't in the game at the moment.  There is no cap on mana efficiency.  Can you clarify what you mean by heal does not break 3 hp  per mana?
---
Haha yea totally
---
But no ur bad
---
Whats amazing to me is how people see one clip of a mage killing two lower levels, one of which is hard countered by them, and they jump to the "mAgEs oP" bullshit. Just wait two phases and we'll be having this same phenomenon about warlocks.
---
I don’t invite mages to my groups. Because they do not understand what it is to play an MMO.
---
Haha yep it sure is.
---
43 here looking at 50 gold. I’ll have my mount by level 90!
---
Healing spec definitely helps. You get better mana efficiency and stronger heals. You don't *need* it but you can save the group from overpulling and don't need to drink as much. Also Holy Nova is very nice to have for dungeons - it costs a crapton of mana but if you use it at the right times it can speed things up. Lyceum is a great example, as you can do significant damage to the dwarves while healing everyone up and most importantly not drawing aggro.
---
I would look to complete quest chains you need, like Tirion's EPL quests and Onyxia pre-quests, as shadow, then respec and spam dungeons.
---
Sexier than a baby is a very low bar to clear. Gonna disable inbox replies as a precaution.
---
Lol people are giving you crap for playing how you like.. smh. The same subreddit that preaches about meme specs being viable is quick to pounce on this for whatever reason. 
---
You should’ve known reddit would hate this post. Haha you’re not “totally in control as a tank” here bro and like those mages are “so quick to aoe”. This group is definitely full of twitch babies that don’t know how to really pull a dungeon... lol or you just cleared a room efficiently with the tools you had available. 
---
I was hoping the comments would be supportive myself but I too forgot reddit hates this play style. 
---
But for real man mute the damn audio and play a silly song or something next time lol or provide commentary we can poke fun at you for
---
Well, there won't be any other time I will be able to take this glorious route after I find the other flight paths. Better go for it before it's gone :D
---
And? I never said that every single member is employed. Of course we have people without jobs.
---
Also, he is a streamer, lmao. Probably the worst example you could pull.
---
Chance to take a hit increases by 100%
---
Go down enc to flurry and then switch over to elemental is the best lvling spec.  You can constantly fish for free mana procs with lvl 1 shocks and then drop the big dmg spell for free.  1h/s with flametongue(if fast weapon) is quite nice and will kill just as fast as windfury imo.  I tend to rock Rockbiter over windfury as well when soloing (higher constant dmg(and huge crits) vs proc chance (and you need windfury to crit and to proc early for it to make a difference).
---
I think the real fun from shamans is you can constantly change it up and do something new... play 15-20m with 1h/shield, switch to a 2H Rockbite for a little, see a guy to pvp (turn on WF), group forming and needs heals (slap on that int gear and heal that shit).
---
I didn’t say I wanted to be the best I just want to handle my own. I just don’t want to die all the time not because of skill but because my class just doesn’t cut it
---
It gets tougher as you go, but its not impossible.  It will be harder the more undergeared the rest of your party is, but if you can find higher lvl groups farming certain things (arena, lbrs 3 boss, etc) you can have them carry you.
---
Personally, lvling my priest alt, I dont think I'd respecc unless I flat out stopped running in the world.
---
As for your spec, before 40 you dont go deeper in shadow than imp SWP, and you put the rest in disc.  At 40, you respecc to shadowform, and for the next 5 lvls you pick up imp wand spec and continue going down disc again.  Speaking as a 14 year priest who played a ton in vanilla.
---
If dungeons become a challenge you can instead respecc into holy instead of disc, and keep your shadow stuff.
---
Dismissing a pet lowers its happiness. Eyes of the beast it far enough away it de-spawns  and you don't lose happiness.
---
You are the best FC so there's that.
---
When I do it people usually either say yes, or don't reply at all. Easy to just ignore a single whisper.
---
Looks like MikScrollingBattleText
---
I just like that some content is actually group-content. Even if you can solo it, there's more often than not, someone else doing the exact same quest, so you group up. In Retail you just tag it and move on.
---
\&gt;&gt;  the mage will wait a bit longer before joining the fight, it's not an issue. 
---
Giving the tank a single pull where he's got a few seconds to get at least a little agro on the mobs before the Mage catches up and starts bombing the AOE again does not sound like the worst thing that could possibly happen.
---
\- warrior
---
lol i think you forgot a lot about classic. I played and still loved warrior nerf after nerf but most of them were necessary. Warriors were strong af. We did get some buffs though like tool tip clarified or new icon.
---
in vanilla I leveled as shadow. I am planning to level a alt priest and doing this: get spirit tap, imp wand, then imp pain. Then I am going down the holy tree.
---
I thought TBC really nailed the talents. To me they kept the feeling of classic wow play, but while making all specs at least functional.
---
Tanking isn’t as hard as tanks want you to think. I Tanked in Vanilla, BC, WotLK very aggressively and then started playing more casually. 
---
Tanking isn’t hard but as a tank we want to look at DPS like there is no way they can do what we do.
---
This is a good one because I hate it lol. Imo classic Respec costs force people to finally actually think about their end game spec. If you want to do specific things when you hit max level you might need a suboptimal spec that defines a character that is right for you. This adds way more variety than people constantly swapping between 3 cookie cutter builds.
---
I want to raid and PvP on my 60 druid so I made a hybrid spec that sacrifices a few of the raiding Staples for a couple great PvP tools. These decisions define your character much more than constant respecs.
---
And it wasn't really this bad. My boy honcho forgot to turn on  his wpvp client it seems, typically you had a client with no big addons like threat/dps meters etc. and that really lowered the lag by a fuck ton.
---
Y tho
---
Hey did you used to play on a WOTLK private server with the name Polynikes? Think this guy raid led and played druid healer maybe was a while ago
---
Killing two lower levels by CCing one. Omg so OP. Surely no other class can accomplish that.
---
Thats why you snipe enemy mages and steal mobs from mages of own faction :) of course done at max level against helpless mages
---
Haha fair point.  Same boat really like 2-3 hours a day, and sometimes less when i play WoWS for a bit.  But man i still want alts so bad haha
---
Cause it's better? Hello?
---
So you need at least 2 people in the dungeon and one person anywhere else. The people in the dungeon /camp  once the person outside the dungeon sees every  go DC they reset the instance. When the people in the instance religion they are back at the starting point with a fresh dungeon.
---
This is really helpful in zones like Mara or BRD where there is no real easy way to get out besides dying or hearthing...  You have one party member die (or a rogue stealth out, or one person hearth if you have a lock to summon) everyone else camp out reset and log in. That way you don't have to all die and you can run it again.
---
It is also important to not that when you do this you will appear where you entered the instance. So in cases like Mara when you use the scepter , or other zones with back entrances, you will appear at the scepter  zone in spot.
---
Also last important thing, if you are chain running an instance like this (aoe group or high level farming drops) that if you hit you instance limit when you log back it you will be back at your hearth point
---
\*Confused goat screeching\*
---
nwm..wrong replay..
---
Oh my GOODNESS.  He better not!  I’ve worked so hard to establish my brand on www.livejournal.com !!!!
---
Do you not hate wasting time waiting on the boat? I almost always have to wait a full rotation to get on the boat.
---
It could also be done for fun.
---
I put the condom on mobs I intend to not pull as a caution. Condom always means caution.
---
I think that is mainly because mages have tools to level faster than other classes.
---
The lvl of your pet is only the multiplier for it's points.
---
The amount of talent points they can have is based in this.
---
(Pet lvl) x (loyalty-1)
---
Without having to understand that.  A lvl 50 pet will earn talent points faster than a lvl 30.
---
Getting a low lvl pet will learn earn talent points slower plus you will have to level it.
---
On my about half the LF's for ZF and SM are spellcleaves.
---
No it isn't lmao
---
I Reporter a hunter starting at 38 never Seen to be online after Level 50. Took almost a week, 20 guildies reporting and me sending a Ticket daylie because He was selling 1000's of leather
---
Ahh Bikini Bottom
---
1 gold seems to be the standard portal tip, but the reagent costs 20s so I'd say bare minimum at least tip 20s to pay for their reagent and a little extra for their time. :)
---
BFA mindset. "I should be able to win even against my hard counters and even though they got the jump on me".
---
Oh I had no idea it happened in Borderlands 2, I think I always wait and buy game of the year editions so I end up with all the current DLC. Same frustration though I'm sure.
---
Ahh, my bad. I didn't think of that possibility. My ethnocentrism is showing.
---
"Unwritten codes" are part of what always made PvP servers entertaining.
---
Depends whatyou want.  Neatplates has a lot of nameplate options.  Action bars, well bartender is popular and has been since actual vanilla.
---
Your question is too broad, though.  What UI specifically are you talking about?
---
I truly despise this man actions,
---
Begging for true classic spirit, end up rolling through golds with his endless donglickers
---
Awesome, this is a big help.  Thanks dude.
---
This. I make gold by tanking strat live and reserving 1 orb for myself. Nobody cares, I get groups together real easily.
---
Warriors are God's in vanilla but mages have been top tier every single expansion since. There is little argument as to who the class favorite is with blizz.
---
I'm just lazy and it seems like a lot of effort TBFH.
---
But by that same token, Dark Souls has taught me to adapt to the game, rather than expecting the game to adapt to me so *shrugs* Maybe I'll learn how this time.
---
You are probably the same guy that cries about griefing or tries to form a "world PvP team" in STV at level 30. 
---
You play your way, he plays his way. Try to lay off the gatekeeping.
---
I picked a druid, no regrets.
---
Last night, the "pull more" happened to me lmao...
---
Yes we wiped.
---
Are you having a stroke or am I?
---
Ill be honest, I picked mage only cause of teleport..
---
So if you can’t kill anything without your cool downs, and you never use your cooldowns, doesn’t that mean you can never kill anything?
---
To dominate. It's a fixed grind. No need to keep grinding, just playing against people who aren't twinks and yell "YOU ARE NOT PREPARED"
---
I’m currently levelling a paladin as ret, overall though the ret tree doesn’t seem to have anything that is really that ‘huge’ in terms of speeding up Leveling.
---
It does seem to be the best spec for solo Leveling but I was thinking if I went prot to righteous fury, then holy to cons, my solo Leveling speed would take a hit but I would be able to tank/heal/dps meaning I could so easily get into dungeon groups.
---
So easier groups for slightly less efficient solo Leveling?
---
Of course it's heavily used everybody is gearing up right now.... How are people saying it incorrectly and what is your issue with it?
---
I played a Hunter back in the day so I’m playing one now as well.
---
I’ve been planning to start an alt once I ding 40 (hopefully sometimes this weekend)
---
At first I thought I would roll Lock for my second character but I’m second guessing it because It feels like I’m just picking a magic version of hunter lol
---
I don’t have much of a preference on what areas they are good in (pvp, pve, etc) because I’ll do a little bit of everything. 
---
Anyone have recommendations? Should I go for something that’s a bigger change?
---
No you are way to triggered, reading way too much into this.
---
All I'm saying is, all kinds of people play the game and it seems right now like you don't HAVE to use everything that was number-crunched for a specific situation. If you like min-maxing, go fucking do it. I like it to a point too, but sometimes we disagree because min-maxers often go for 100% damage.
---
Also, other classes can make up for something that you chose to not do, gaining some other ability.
---
Just calm down. You're the one telling people what's fun or that you have to be the best to be able to have fun.
---
Clearly there wasn’t enough porn on the internet in 2004.
---
... see them driven before us, and hear the lamentation of their women.
---
Yeah the point was to indirectly indicate every dungeon. 
---
I also forgot most bosses can't be taunted. But as others pointed out, raids present other issues to paladins. The biggest of which though IS the mana limitation. They just can't maintain a mana pool for longer raid boss fights and still provide solid threat and also mitigation. 
---
I did word my comment poorly. I was trying to speak in terms of dungeons for the whole thing, but it sounded like I was saying their only issues in raids are also just the lack of a taunt. I never intended to defend them as raid tanks. They really just don't work there outside of undertuned content (MC) or being overgeared for it.
---
Some of us Vanilla mages are Dads too and still playing mages :P
---
I ain't getting no fuckin' bagel 😤
---
I honestly thought that's what you meant. That the alliance players that are complaining are basement dwelling cry babies.  Kind of like telling them, as an alliance player, to man up.
---
If somebody else gets to the node at the same time as me but I'm hitting it first I'll do one and let them kill it. Not so concerned if it's a 3/4 hit node. I do okay on mining and make loads off it anyways. As a hunter tho if I see a horde mining I'll put a freeze trap under them and steal one hit before running away giggling.
---
In dungeons I ask if somebody has BS. If not, it's free game. BS is expensive so they need it more than I do with 2 gathering professions. My rule for dungeons is dont be mining during a pull - freeforall it when out of combat unless they ask to share it
---
I am level 28 lulz.
---
This is my build but everyone climbs feral differently.  Care to detail your spec?
---
I /applaud any skulls that are killing me.
---
I want em to FEEL my pettiness.
---
Follow a leveling guide. There's a bunch, just Google them and pick one you like.
---
Unless you've invited your faction to the group or spoken to them to verify they will help, never assume your faction will help you kill the opposition.
---
We all have reasons to not engage, quest objectives, limited time, not trying to gank players also trying to quest.
---
I typically live or let live for pvp.  If I'm attacked, I'll run.  If I can't run, I'll retaliate.  And funny thing is that most mages or warlocks think they can kill a priest easy.  It's a rough lesson on how difficult it can be.
---
In the Hillsbrad area, Alliance seems to be uncaring of equal levels but will gank if they are red or skulls to you.
---
It's realistic. Feel free to convince me otherwise.
---
At 60 they're supposed to pull aggro. It's not possible to hold off them after the demo nerfs, but they have the tools to do big dps and survive anyway. I'd much rather have the mage doing 1k dps every pull than single targeting for 200, regardless of threat.
---
Plenty of people have bought water for 20s a stack on my server. Plenty tip for even more than 20s a stack. You’re being indignant for no reason.
---
Making stacks can take a stupid amount of time depending on the mage’s level and water asked for. Level 35 water when you’re level 40 takes multiple minutes to make multiple stacks. Sure, you CAN sit there and spend minutes to do something to help someone, or, you can carry on playing the game. If people don’t want to purchase the water no one is making them.
---
You can continue with your “not a stretch” for assuming the groups part. I’m not playing dumb. I replied to one individual comment which didn’t reference groups. There’s a saying about assuming.
---
At what level?
---
Also you should generally use mage armor for dungeons.
---
Also clearcasting is good to have.
---
The first 5 weapon skill matters the most, the next 3 matters a bit, and the rest matters fuck all. If you’re already at 305, I would not use edgemasters.
---
For a while I went through all of Nyhms old wow parody songs. That was fun. Since then it's mostly electro swing or synthwave.
---
Now I’m confused...maybe this was a cry for help
---
Thanks for the input, will definitely research more.
---
I highly enjoyed that reference. Thank you.
---
It makes me sad, I played mage in vanilla and on private servers for years and now I'll be tarred with the same brush as these douchebags.
---
And I'm a scrub but people will be expecting me to be top DPS now...
---
Right, sorry, I wasn't clear.  I was meaning closer to endgame, would it be worthwhile to swap between DW to build rage up and 2H to spam rage-consuming abilities
---
Does Amplify Curse affect Curse of Elements? Didn't know that.
---
YTA people should be invited through actual interactions. Not random invites.
---
I just respecced before seeing this (41 now) and am doing what you wrote here.Thank you for this, it helps!
---
But then thier would would be less than a 99% chance that they would have an overall advantage in wpvp
---
This has already happened to me. I won a fair 1v1 against a 60 frost mage as a 55 hunter. About an hour later I was feeling ballsy and attacked a different 60 mage who completely ruined my shit. Mages are such a crapshoot at this point, I swear lol.
---
Yes, this is how I land my best Cones of Cold.
---
I feel it's a huge waste of gold, as I dont think you can freeze your lvl in classic like you can in retail.
---
But... it's their gold, and twink building does help the WoW economy. So.. let em spend it how they want.
---
I 100% enjoyed and understand what you meant first person here that i think has realistic expectations of what to expect from a random reddit video from a random person
---
It worked great, till blink stubbed its toe on a random piece of terrain.
---
He dies right? Last night, SM graveyard... literally tried a 6 mob pull with Nova and before he could retreat to the tank he died at his feet.
---
So you can only buy the level equivalent of the rewards then? Being in the 10-19 bracket can only buy that brackets of weapons/items?
---
&gt; Mages are OP because the people going up against them don't know how to deal with them.
---
No, it's because PVP trinkets aren't out and there's no way to get out of their slow spam once they've hit you with it.
---
Only time it's an even fight without trinkets is if you pop a FAP before the Mage engages.
---
WHat is moonguard?
---
That shit requires reagents yo.
---
I always carried a stack of runes for the occasion.
---
Same if i manage to kick them. But we (Rogues) also have a few ways out like Vanish, Sprint if specced.
---
Same for hamstring on warriors.
---
High level zones are very balanced in my experience, if not Alli favored.  
---
I saw 1 other Horde in Silithus yesterday after about an hour.  Easily 2 dozen alliance.  That being said, I spent almost my whole 30-40s in STV and rarely saw another Alli.  It wasn't until about 45+ where things started to feel a lot more balanced.
---
IDK if that's just the natural progression of layering sorting itself out, where factions clump up in one layer and stay there when it isn't as contested.  I mean, you can only switch layers by joining a group, and you can only join groups from your faction.  That inherently puts more of that faction on that layer over time, thus making it more likely that you join those groups in the future (and ask for a layer switch when you're on the horde dominated one).
---
Edited to reflect this thank you!
---
Does it make it sound like the pew pew pew mouse farts from the movies?
---
Very clean.
---
Do you have an issue with the target frame?
---
I usually right click the screen to change orientation, instead of pressing A or D.
---
With this, I just realized I should rebind my A and D to something else .... only took me like 5k hours of WoW. Thanks I guess!
---
Look into a speed levelling addon like Azeroth autopilot which optimises your questing routes, pretty much telling you where to go, what order to do them etc.
---
I do think that it would work a little better in prot spec, with improved taunt/sunder armor, shield specialization and what have you, but this stuff still only works when you're being hit/have rage.
---
And people don't seem to understand how hard it is to keep aggro on an aoe zerg fest, where you literally can't even keep aggro on a singular mob inspite of blowing all your rage generators and taunt.
---
Of course you have aggro during a taunt, but no matter what I did I would lose aggro right after it ran out.
---
Each of the dps were consistently pulling 200+ dps. Nothing you can do in that case.
---
Edit: Except communicate, which I admitted I didn't do much and accept the blame for.
---
I'm Alliance, so that doesn't apply to me unfortunately. I'll update my flair.
---
&gt;so 30% of the pop rolled warriors and
---
Feels like it's closer to 5% tho, since it takes fucking years to find a tank for a dungeon.
---
Only alliance players do this. Cowards.
---
That makes a lot of sense with some +hit gear it’s pretty easy to hit 2 levels above
---
Why do you say fury is so bad? Prot gives absolutly no dps increases, which you need, and Arms is a lower dps until mortal strike.
---
I put 5 points into Spirit Tap and Wand damage, 10 into Holy for .5 seconds reduced cast time on heals, and then went mostly down the Disc tree for the rest of leveling, dipping into Holy in the 40's/50's for things like Holy Nova and Inspiration. I never went Shadow.
---
Damage solo is actually quite good and it's great for dungeon healing as well. Respecced to PI at 60.
---
Contrary to popular belief, there's zero reason to ever go Shadow unless you want to be Shadow at 60, or you will *almost never* be healing in groups.
---
Its ok, I camped the shit off his corpse until he swapped layers.
---
The Road is definitely worth the read as well. Super brutal, has a strange style of writing but MAN it’s good. I didn’t think the movie really did it justice (although I really enjoyed the movie as well).
---
It’s not my fault that they chose the wrong faction
---
I'm a mage and I approve this message.
---
That's funny, once on a private server we had a priest try to reserve the triune when it dropped because it has spirit so it's a healer item. I think the warrior countered with "this is vanilla, everything has spirit on it"
---
No, it's not.
---
Let me put it to you this way, I'm putting this whole fucking dungeon in my rearview!
---
I will say the four hour BRD run where we reset after people left an hour in.... just to be a few bosses from finish and the warrior dumb pulls, wipes, doesn’t run back, then decides to leave left a bad taste in my mouth. I’ve had positive pug experiences overall in my many years of playing wow... Boy was I salty after.
---
Myself and a 60 warrior were grinding the same mobs last night.  Everything was fine, until he decided just to tag every mob he could with hamstring/intercept.  So, naturally waited for the mobs to get him to half health and jumped his ass.  Felt no shame.
---
Works fine in dungeons. 1-40 you should be going straight for Dark Pact. Then you have access to unlimited mana in dungeons. After that, go down the destro tree for the good Shadowbolt talents. Imp Shadowbolt, Bane &amp; Devastation. Sure you wont get Ruin, but you will have unlimited mana.
---
Use Imp for Blood Pact, disable Fireball. Use it as a mana battery. Nobody will complain because your utility &amp; AoE is too good. Healthstones, Soulstones, curses to buff everyone damage, CC, Imp stamina buff &amp; Fire Shield on tank.
---
Just corruption on everything then spam Shadowbolt on the thing dying the fastest. Switch targets when its low health. Spam Dark Pact as needed. Almost zero downtime. AoE pulls, just corruption on everything then RoF.
---
No burst? I guess. But the shadowbolt talents still make you a monster, and the fact you can cast them forever with Dark Pact makes you a sustain beast in a boss fight, and you can /dance whilst the mages need to drink.
---
Lmfao I know. I actually had a mage ask why I wasn't spamming volley and called me a noob. I then explained volley has a CD, and isn't worth it without at least 3+ mobs since it's only 50 per. Then I saw the same person Blizzarding on single pull mobs.
---
And when there is another warlock you get irritated that you have to pay attention to what dots are yours
---
Either advertise an upfront charge or dont get upset when people dont tip.
---
Fishing Rods don't have enough dps to make pvp worth it :o)
---
I gank every red I see. Doesn’t matter about level or if they’re afk, sleeping, fighting, running up on me. Red = dead.
---
You uhh, have 2 of those three things before max level too. 
---
And currently raids take up 3-5 hours of your time a week. While leveling is 100+ hours of the game.
---
In other words, there is significantly less to do at max than during leveling for quite some time, so not enjoying what is currently the entire meat of the game kind of is an issue.
---
Thanks for the breakdown, I love reading stuff like this - makes high level play understandable.
---
The quote is a Boondock Saints reference for those who don't know.
---
I think you'll find that if you removed all of the people complaining about those things you'd be left with a very solid core of people that are happy playing the game the way it is. This sub grew insanely in the month or 2 leading up to release and as with all gaming subs... Angry people are much more likely to talk loudly.
---
Incorrect on the human with axe part
---
I'm a mage cause I like sniping bitches with pyro
---
What is "the most recent data"?  I haven't seen 60/40 numbers since the poll on this subreddit was out, and that was pre-launch.  Everything since has indicated Skeram is the 2nd most imbalanced server with well into a 70/30 or worse ratio.
---
Imagine thinking the pants on an obscure character that doesn’t even have voice lines are a real problem effecting women. Like some dude just rolls up to the salt flats, see pants shorter than the thigh and decides, “hm now I feel like oppressing women today.”  
---
It’s not objectification because she IS a fucking OBJECT you idiot. Just like the fucking grunts at orgimmer. She’s not real so she doesn’t fucking care how long her pants are, and neither did anyone else until it was changed for no fucking reason
---
twink gear is set and fairly easy to get. There is no grind to r14, no new raid to grind out. You get the gear then you just pvp.
---
Same. I was so pumped to do a bit of aoe grinding like I did back in the day. Oh how naive I was.
---
I just run dungeons to get mine. You will get the gold on your way to pre bis.
---
You can't kill them if you're grouped with them
---
lmao I pretty much only play warrior and never knew that
---
The hit cap is NEVER 8% so please do not spread false information.
---
Zandalar Tribe best Tribe!
---
Hope you both enjoy the game! 
---
See you in the Arathi Highlands, Horde scum! &lt;3
---
So better off using the devilsaur gloves? I can basically get them for the same price is the only reason I'm asking. I don't need the hit bonus from the devilsaur set, I'm already soft capped.
---
No its 6% if you have 305. Weapon skill gives hit
---
haha this post was made for me. Just got 60 a few days ago, have almost all pre-raid BiS already besides a few spots + epic pattern I need to buy. I've already rerolled a shammy I planned to use as a healer eventually, however leveling is elemental till 30 I think, then going enhancement, but the end goal is restro. Shammy is level 13.
---
If you find it boring now, you'll definitely hate raiding.
---
Mates are the new hunters aren’t they?
---
I wasn't confused at all...
---
Also everything was new and nobody knew what end game was so there was no rush.
---
I think Arcatraz is a solid #2, Imo. It was tough, but I think MgT expected you to be a little more built for it, since it came out later.
---
Dude tank advantage existed forever. In WOTLK I got paid 50-100 gold for a heroic run. I just advertised myself as tank and said that I will run the random heroic with DD's that pay me 50 Gold. Usually had 2 of them within a minute. They got their instant dungeon instead of waiting 30-60 minutes and I got some gold.
---
I can tell you a full (quest) clear of ST will take 2-3 hours, not including group formation/travel, so belay that hope.
---
Ye, 3+ mobs it makes sense at least.
---
dungeons, yes. raids, no
---
Depends if you do 1st boss/beetles in North and satyr in East I'd imagine?
---
I just spent so much time questing there over the years haha I know all the quests by heart and it's so fucking big
---
Had a Hunters pet wipe up in Gnomer when we were jumping down to kill the Vicious Water Elemental Boss. Pretty much caused the group to disband.
---
That's why I didnt use a definitive. Like saying, "people who twink are wasting their gold! And they shouldnt do it!!!" 
---
 I added a crucial part of my opinion, "I feel." Which is why I dont do it. But then pointed out that, just because I dont do it, doesnt mean people arent free to do as they please.
---
Sorry if you automatically thought I was insulting your twink?
---
lol ya he is a ??. Just fish and keep to yourself.
---
I love healing pala tanks, they have no taunt but they have great aoe threat generation. Sounds like your guy was doing something wrong. 
---
Most warlocks I've spoken to don't expect you to heal their life tap damage. If they pull aggro then ill shield and heal them up but if the tank and lock are both doing their job it doesn't matter if the lock is on 10% health for the whole fight. If you are low on mana after a fight let them tap then heal them up before drinking.
---
Tailor/Enchanter works best as you can Disenchant the stuff you make...and mats are relatively easy to obtain. Engineer is best for hunters for scopes and ammo. But...Do What You Want!
---
I've only ever done this Alliance side. I knew it was different for the Horde, but not that different. Horde side doesn't even walk into BRD for their attunement.
---
Everything I googled said killing what I was already killing would at least get me to honored not 1 point away from honored don’t be a jackass lol
---
If you get into ElvUI and go to action bars you should have an option for pet that you may have to enable.
---
That's the thing, every class can cut it. If you think you might be at a disadvantage, you will. PvP in classic is not balanced nor fair. If you really like pvp and no other aspect of the game you will be disappointed.
---
My mana (precious)*
---
Pretty much this https://youtu.be/iBv5X9000Ig
---
Oops, no it doesn’t my bad.
---
Yup that's bug abuse right there.
---
Doesn't even have to be a "good mage", just needs to do basic mage stuff and warrior is fucked. Kinda funny when mages get off on this like "omg i just outplayed that warrior so hard, damn i'm good", meanwhile they just spammed frostbolt, with the occasional frost nova + blink.
---
Good thing redoubt procs off crits huh
---
Ya'll ready for this hot take?
---
That Prot Paladin is the superior dungeon tanking class/spec. So many do not understand the glory of Holy Shield + Shield Spike! All these bandwagoners who go Warrior because it's the best single target raid tank and then fail miserably trying to tank dungeons.

Rogue here. Can confirm. I drink healing potions like gatorade and the amount this eases my downtime while leveling is extremely noticeable.
---
Arcane Concentration, you can pick up while still getting the shatter / 100% improved crit
---
Arcane meditation does sound pretty good, especially combined with Mage Armor (45% total mana regen while casting)
---
Although.. Mages don't stack spirit so the mana regen isn't that high anyway... I don't know if it's worth losing 100% crit damage + 50% crit chance on frozen targets for
---
Thing is, you can drink after every fight. If you can't drink during a fight and you NEED mana, you have Evocation + Mana Crystals + Mana Pots at your disposal so really you have like 2 mana pools to work with. 
---
Maybe for a really long fight it'd be worth it, idk
---
Technically he was referring to a different user, but brick\_frog\_ definitely also fits the bill.
---
I never selected "need" for it when it dropped. The first time, I was healing, and I was only lvl 35, so I didn't feel good needing for it yet. 
---
I won it. 
---
The next couple of runs, I won three more, by just clicking greed.
---
Had a like 23 mage whisper my tank last night when he was looking for dps for uldaman "try me out." What...? lmao.
---
yeah, a heal is basically topping up my mana, im like uh ok DOTS DOTS MORE DOTS.
---
Your entire life is depressing if you think that type of humor is okay, but you're probably the same piece of shit that thinks Greta Thunberg should just "be in class, " huh?
---
Yeah, that is pretty close to what it sounds like.
---
Take a listen
---
https://youtu.be/LvWQhP0NJFE?t=229
---
Not nearly as high as on a mob. Level difference means far less in PvP. In this particular instance, it makes practically no difference
---
Hmm mana *drools*
---
Well it does. You sure af can look for a group with another tank. But it will take a lot of time to find one. If you are a DD you are expendable. It takes 2 minutes to get another DD who does the exact same thing you do. It takes 30-60 minutes to find another tank.
---
&gt; "people arent better now, I cant wait until private server players get a reality check when real vanilla comes out and theybsee how private servers got literally everything wrong"
---
The irony to this often said thing about pserver players is..
---
..Yeah, they got it wrong, But that wrong was in the direction of harder (to some degree)
---
Are those names verboden on RP servers?
---
I have 300 engineering what items should I make for dungeons. I think iron grenades are the most cost efficient but I'm not sure
---
Ironic that you're dumping on tanks for their skill choices and then advocating for *swipe* of all spells.
---
Swipe is trash, tab maul is more AOE threat, sadly enough.
---
Death has no lasting consequences, so...yes.
---
They were and omar confirmed cross realm bgs in an interview
---
Okay gotcha, I didn't know if you were sitting looking at an amazing deal on the AH.
---
I would tell your friend to sell them for what they are actually worth, personally
---
Yep, I have just corrected my post. Thanks for pointing it out!
---
I don’t know dude. I was running with some hunters who somehow made it to mara and they were horrible lol. (I’m a mage btw)
---
Context for new players.  Hunter is on a class quest, started from a drop on a MC penultimate boss.  Quest involves killing a few demons, fully solo.  Any assistance on you or on the target will result in the mob despawning and for you to try again.  The demons hit really hard and require you to kite for several minutes.
---
Had the rogue just thrown a dagger at the demon, the hunter would have lost a ton of effort and have to wait until the coast was clear to start again.
---
 /kiss
---
You probably should keep farming. Ravager is used up to and including 40 man raids for aoe dps. 
---
I ran armory about 70-ish times before I finally got help from lvl 60's from the guild (so that I wouldn't have to roll against anyone), and it ended up dropping on the very first run.
---
Meanwhile the diversity if a different word is being explained by the tank during that pull.
---
Opinions are not free from questioning simply because they are opinions.
---
I play the mini game of how many times can I do it before I die. Also make sure to get a screenshot. Sometimes I will even ask a Alliance friend to follow them around golf clapping.
---
had the same thing I was gonna roll Tauren Shaman and when it was time to start playing I was like, just give me back my druid!.. I couldn't see myself play anything else
---
Which is less efficient than evis.
---
There is no 50% crit chance bonus because you don't take 5/5 shatter in an AOE build. If you CoC after Nova with a proper AOE build, all you've done is waste your Nova by breaking most mobs out of the frozen state.
---
I will do that. Synthwave is a genre I've never tackled but appreciated.  There was a metalcore (meh) local band near me that started to write a whole wow themed album back in 07. But then they switched it to a Skyrim themes album. Played the songs live but sadly never recorded :(
---
You had that in Mists. A whole patch
---
say something! they probably dont know better lmao
---
The one above their heads? That's just toggling name plates, which I believe is SHIFT+V in game.
---
Glory to the Alliance!
---
Wand will be your main source of damage until at least 40. There's plenty of lists that show you the best wands for each level range and where to get them.
---
Please, teach your mates to /rand for the chest loot!
---
Not as useless? Shadow priests are one of if not the best 1v1 class in the game.
---
Cone of Cold &gt; Frost Nova &gt; Walk into mobs despite the Nova &gt; Arcane Explosion &gt; Die &gt; It's everyone elses fault
---
try standing in tanaris for about 10 mins and report back
---
No. Humans dont want edgemasters. You clearly dont know ehay weapon skill does or what you are talking about. But you still post and give advice as if you do. Why? Why lie and pretend? 
---
What does weapon skill do buddy? If you cant answer that why  are you posting advice?
---
See reply to OP
---
Based on old information. I believe fire is good in..AQ40 gear? But I’m pretty sure fire got good with a certain gear set
---
Lol that makes a lot of sense. Yeah I think the only alternative is Silverpine for horde.
---
Anybody know what addon show buffs and debuffs as flying text? I can't find same one as in the video.
---
Not without disabling other sounds. You can still have high misic or ambience though.
---
I don't go oom with 2-3 single target mobs. It would take at least 3~ pulls of 2-3 single target mobs for me to go oom
---
But yeah, mages do have mana problems. I don't think it makes or breaks the class though, because you can just drink before any important fight where your DPS is critical
---
Due to a dagger's speed you'd pretty much never want to main hand it unless it is a much higher DPS than your previous main hand, or you are planning on going a dagger build and backstabbing.
---
You need to Los the cast then when it fails to cast get in los again so he begins another cast then los again and repeat
---
So there are two types of reserve groups.
---
1. It is the leader who reserved loot for themselves, spending the effort to find the other 4 people.
---
2. Is the tank who demands a reserve and they are more worthwhile. They bring more to the table than a DD.
---
"Wait you don't have auto-renew?" - Blizzard
---
That leveling guide you found is likely very close to the one I'm following. Its been great honestly. I've been healing dungeons with no problems. I can really survive ganks really well (usually till they give up lol).
---
I'll be respecting at 40 full shadow as well. Shadow is not really the best until shadowform anyway.
---
Dont both leveling holy imo. It can be done and won't be that much worse but you will likely feel it when it comes to killing mobs.
---
Lol, when that happens it looks like a Skaven invasion with so many mobs.
---
I have to agree with all your points.
---
But as a player who mostly pvp at 60 and as a decked out 29 hunter and warrior, i must say that the reason it died out, wasnt only for the fact that i couldnt stomp others. There simply wasnt any bgs to join after the changes unless i waited for hours. My favourite part of twinking was my rivalries with similarly geared twinks of the opposite faction. And that was playing in a battlegroup with a huge twink community. In addition twinking is an easy way for more casual solo players to get that BIS completionist feeling with a character.
---
To laugh at all the morons that care enough to post stupid ass threads about it.
---
You get a message in chat
---
For controlling the pet I just have a macro of /petattack that's bound to my mouse wheel click, then I just use the default ctrl+2 bind for the follow command. I've seen some people bind mouse wheel up to /petattack and mouse wheel down to /petfollow, so that could be an option for you. Don't really need any complicated macros in my opinion.
---
Oh, and another thing I forgot to mention. You'll get multishot at a fairly low level. It's one of your best abilities and part of your standard damage rotation, even single target, but you almost never want to use it right away on a dungeon pull because you'll easily draw aggro. Also, be extremely mindful of CC when you use it. It'll often get targets further away than you'd expect and it's kind of a stereotype that hunters will constantly break CC with it.
---
Use your own judgement obviously. Not saying buff everyone you see. But one buff is nothing.
---
Its 2019. Hot pants are objectifying digital wamen.
---
&gt; Does anyone know if there is a thought process behind choosing a faction as APES? For example does Alliance give something special that will help them perform or gain a slight advantage or does it come down to just preference?
---
Probably because they know a lot of people will go horde, and they're a PVP guild first, Gear helps in PvP. And if they rolled H? that'd be that much less people to PvP, might as well roll on a PvE server if everyone goes H.

Can we get a different tab for classic I hate to see the ads for retail every time I want to start classic... I know you can just open classic directly but then you have to log in every time.
---
you know I thought about that and I have no clue, but I'm going to try when I get off work.
---
what about if your weapon skill is 310? (+5 for human, +5 for talents)
---
The counterplay is having a trinket, sadly. Can't wait until honor rewards are implemented
---
Kinda skipped Mists sadly. Panda land looked cool.
---
yea true but in EU it has been and always will be more of a problem.
---
Look in the AH every time you're there for staves. Staves sometimes has very high base damage, and sell cheap if they have str, agi or simply doesnt have intellect on them.
---
MORE DAMAGE!
---
Correct, and also each class had three specific forms of CC that their pvp trinket broke, it wasn't all CC until TBC
---
[List of trinkets](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18834/insignia-of-the-horde#see-also)
---
Yup that's getting installed. Thank you for you work.
---
as shaman, who can heal, I use tons of bandages. They save me from drinking as much. First Aid is universally the best secondary profession for every class. Every class should be using it.
---
One family.
---
Those aren't in classic.
---
I saw a person with a mini diablo this week. So it exists.
---
Yeah, honestly at 60 as long as you have a sword/shield, I think you can tank the dungeons as any spec.  More points in prot might help if you are struggling, but like I said, I've been absolutely fine tanking them as 31/20/0.
---
Yeah, that would frustrate the hell out of me too.
---
I have thought it through and I fundamentally disagree.
---
Only ppl I ignore are people who spam guild lfm in random zone chat that aren't cities or trade
---
Same wow account it was originally redeemed on?  Like from before the battle net merge?
---
Did you miss the tanking thread? I think by now the post is outdated, but I daresay that if you ventured there, boy will you be dismayed.
---
Just the sheer number of warriors who came in to justify themselves on why they charge in with a 2H weapon, how oh it's impossible to get and keep aggro with a 1h+shield. And to top it off(and this will trigger you) a healer who actually wrote in to say, *not to let him ever have over 50% mana*.
---
The elitist attitudes are just coming out like insects out of the walls.
---
Are there any good YouTube leveling playthroughs that people are watching? Just looking for something to have on in the background while at work. Any class/race, etc.
---
Effectively infinite range and ignores LoS issues.
---
Back when I played, our server (Burning Blade) had a pretty massive lvl 29 scene on both sides (this was pre cross-realm BG's). We were horde and had a guild of about 30 different fully decked out lvl 29s who played on the regular. We also had a rival Alliance guild with similar numbers.   
---
Killing lowbies and under-geared players was fun, yes, but the **most** fun I have ever had playing WoW was when you got a full pre-made lvl 29 match. The reason being: Everyone was on completely equal grounds b/c twink gear is essentially set in stone. Everyone had the same stats, same gear, etc... so the matches were always completely neck and neck, down to the wire nail biters. Easily some of my fondest memories from back in the day and I can't wait to get back there and do it again.

Is there something I need to do to be a good dps other than not be an idiot?
---
DAE find that the majority of mages are just bad?  It's like they only know how to blizzard and CoC
---
SM or ZF
---
"WHAT THE FECK, PECK?"
---
Just make sure you have your westfall chicken out when doing it
---
Awesome. Thanks for the link. I will check it out!
---
What kind of professions would you take with druid?
---
Ret will be slower than a shaman. They have sustain. 
---
Mages are always sought after, and have/will have through Classic high dps. 
---
Rogues scale, and are great. 
---
Hunters are in the same boat. 
---
Honestly, if it were me, I’d choose the class you like the most out of the three. They have more buttons to press for DPS whereas Paladins (Ret) have very few.
---
And worst solo PvPer in the game.
---
Yeah, I've seen a multi go 90 from my position to hit something barely in my range when there were three months in front of me.... Oh well guess we'll kill those guys too.
---
Horde *need* priests, they are the only defensive magic dispel.
---
Yeah frost is best for damage atm but it is a relaunch of classic so who knows what people will find.
---
Are we talking new+ like the latest Star Wars films are Star Wars+ or something more like Casino Royale is James Bond+?
---
Cus the new SW films are like WoW retail, but Casino Royale felt like a good follow on from other Bonds.
---
He's saving that for when the bindings of the windseeker drop
---
Because generally speaking, the various twink brackets are static, there's no new raid or additional end game content that will likely affect it (expansion can as we saw BC Enchants &amp; Professional BOP items in the 39+ Brackets.)
---
So you can actually work your way to a '100% prefect' twink for a given class and bracket with enough time and gold that shouldn't ever need anymore upgrades.
---
Don't get me started with DK's and the 59 Bracket...
---
Why would Blizzard give you a shot that cleaves if they didnt want you to use it?
---
It looks likes a Redbridge or stonetalon tree to me
---
Then how come you're having trouble with it? It was *clearly" hyperbole here
---
This makes me want to take some unsuspecting fucker on an adventure. Bring'm all the way up the coast to newmans landing or w/e
---
Training ports is like 2g each and we only use them for other people, since we can just use the teleport spells which have a cheaper reagent on ourselves instead of portal.
---
 If I'm already grouped with someone I wouldn't mind porting for reagent cost, but if I have to stop what I'm doing and wait for someone to run across the zone I'll take my 80s, especially since I haven't broken even on training yet.
---
Calling for your guildies to gang the enemy rogue is the most ridiculous waste of time for everyone.
---
im curious why shapeshifter affects it at all?  Are you confusing it with feral instinct?
---
Lol awesome...it was fun being a noob now that I think about it.
---
Is Hearthseeker Alliance dominated? I'd much rather be an underdog questing with my two friends in STV and Arathi. Right now Alliance just get stomped unless the Horde are feeling kind.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to that. This kind of armor comes from likes of Conan The Barbarian, and movies and comics inspired by it. They had both women and men in very skimpy and unrealistic armors, or not wearing armor at all. Also both sexes have very different ideas of what makes them sexual. Men like their women in revealing armors while women like their men strong, revealing or not. This stuff isn't based on just men's idea of what sexualized wardrobes should look like. It's not like WOW, Conan and basically any famous piece of fantasy media was made solely by men for men.
---
What are they doing that's so important it's worth using that item?
---
Well said and I agree completely; especially about the gnomes.
---
I feel like Mages simply have more AoE options.
---
And no, purples (epics) aren't the rarest. There are also oranges (legendaries). Raid boss weapons/drops.
---
Besides being a dick, what did you accomplish?
---
The people that degrade the experience of others because of "muh horde" are way too cringy.
---
Yeah horde warrior as well, 32 level and 225 first aid. Been progressing along nicely
---
I play a feral druid and walk all over mages. Most mages dont even realize that I am immune to polymorph. When they realize that they frost nova, which i can break free of by swapping forms, then eat them. They can't even blink to run away because I will just travel form into entangling roots.
---
Druids are very good at fighting mages. Shadow priests, however, give me a lot of trouble.
---
Why the fused wiring?  I looked at the patterns it is used in, and they seemed good but I dunno what would make them better later on.  What kind of longer term value is there in it?
---
KNOWING THOSE MOBS CANT FRIGT BACK?
---
If anything, stop questing a little before you hit 60 and then go back and do all those skipped quests for the gooooooooold
---
I play both and they both have a pretty high skillcap in pvp. 
---
You saw a mage get an ideal 2v1 with the jump. Don't be salty.
---
Hmm alright. I'll check it next time, although I did check everywhere on the top. Might have missed it anyway *shrug*
---
Worldbuffs? Could you explain more?
---
I hope so
---
Hunters don't scale well with gear, which is a double edged sword. Leveling, and in pre-bis at 60, good hunters can be top DPS in dungeons/MC.
---
Gear improves their DPS for sure, but not to any great extent. Unlike mages and warriors. Which start off pretty meh, and end up scaling to ridiculous DPS numbers once geared.
---
Ah, well, if you are like me and you need to right click your screen in order to be able to turn, you might right click your target frame instead, which can be infuriating. For this reason, I've put my target frame one-two squares above yours, so that I can freely right click in that screen space.
---
That is true but you are missing the downrank coefficient.   (level of spell + 4) / (your level) * Spell Coefficient (.857) so at level 60 Heal rank 2 is a coefficient of ((22+4)/60 ) * .857 = .4285
---
so Rank 2 Heal is only getting 400 *.425 = 171+ not 343
---
so Heal Rank 2 - 460 + 171 = 631HP/205MP  3.07 HP/MP
---
its just not as good
---
Stack up on free action potions, a nifty stopwatch and a frost reflector lol
---
I love these posts man, even as someone who's least favourite race is forsaken i'm really loving your valliant warrior
---
Any chance we'll be able to purchase realm switches in the near future that can be used even if the server isn't full? I'm playing Horde on Stalagg, but the faction ratio is heavily skewed for Horde. Given that wPvP is a big part of WoW's fun for me, I'd like to switch into a realm that's a lot closer to 50/50 distribution without having to lose all the progress on my characters
---
Nah.  I’ll bonk whoever I want.  It happens to me all the time; I’ve grown cold to it.  No police enforcement in game outside of cities.
---
Resist gear, but nobody takes that while leveling.
---
It helps if you don't start you rotation with your strongest abilities and especially aoe's. Once threat is established its fine to use them, but I've seen so many fellow huntards open up with max rank multishot and then go 'aggro in classic ls is a joke, lol' then continue doing that every pull.
---
I don't have to like them, but these are the rules.
---
Unless you already have your epic mount+training, I would honestly sell it now. As more and more pets drop, the price will just keep going down.
---
Sell it now and buy it back later for less (if you like the pet)
---
Drastically increased utility. Rank 1 lets you target anything in your line of sight up to 100 yards. Even lets you jump a bit, but as far as I'm aware all targets must be in your line of sight and within 100 yards.
---
Rank 2? Rank 2 doesn't care about that. First target must be in your line of sight. After that you can jump to any other target from there and you can do that until they enter a new continent or a new instance. Want to see how Gadgetzan is looking from Darkshore? You can do it by jumping target to target with rank 2.
---
Rogues are great for getting into areas/dungeons to specific parts.  Mages will clear a lot of mobs much faster, but there will be downtime with drinking. 
---
Mages will have a much easier time grinding multiple mobs, whereas rogues (combat) will need to wait on cool downs to farm a group of mobs well.
---
Where you die at exactly? There is quite a few party-checks leading up to Emp that can wipe a group. I consider the Lyceum the hardest part, personally.
---
How can you see enemy buffs?
---
And siphon life.
---
And drain life.
---
Dude. Just ignore the warlock until he goes "uhh a little help lol?"
---
The paladin trees are a freaking mess. Why is Consecration 11 points down the holy tree?
---
*kind of not kind have
---
Go ahead and list those very specific and singular abilities in the game and compare them to an entire toolkit. part of the reason they're so broken, admittedly, is because we dont have pvp trinkets yet. Never insinuated they were immortal gods. They do not have any glaring weaknesses.
---
I've pvp'd at gladiator level since BC on multiple classes, I think i know a thing or two about recognizing imbalances, but go off.
---
I'm using Classic to level Alliance AND PVP Server for the first time, and really noticing this. You get a few honorless dogs that grab an easy cheap kill on the grey-level enemy, but on the majority most of the enemy faction I run across just wanna get where they're going or focus on their quests. Can leave each other in peace for the most part.
---
Coming from 15 years on PVE servers where people tend to only flag if they are feeling bloodthirsty, and from leveling in War Mode BFA where people are just constantly being dicks with no provocation, I expected a PVP server to be a constant warzone of ganks making it impossible to play, but for the most part it's really no different from PVE. Most people just want to focus on their own thing.
---
hehe this made me snicker a bit.
---
But in all seriousness, when the group is not a good one, with melee dps pulling aggro from the tank near constantly, it feels like I'm healing 2-3 tanks. I feel compelled to just toss the dps a rejuv and let them sort it out the rest themselves.
---
Funny thing is, once I started just doing that, I saw the dps start to back off.
---
Sick story bro
---
I see a pretty horrific skull up there, like, idk, why would you even..?
---
Tbh, you should just lie about your spec, heal the dungeon, and then pop shadowform at the end.
---
Well said
---
And I paid 40g for robe of the void pattern lol... About 200g extra worth of mats
---
You had me in the first half. I started in wrath so those are my fondest memories but classic has been amazing. I find myself logging on with no real purpose. I'll do some questing maybe a dungeon, switch to an alt and pick flowers or something
---
Shadow priest vs warrior is quite literally a 90-10 matchup. Outside of outgearing you significantly and basically one shotting you, there's is nothing a warrior can do to touch a decent priest.
---
Shut up and enjoy the video.
---
This confused me as well. Frost armor would definitely help.
---
You mean I CAN'T blizzard before the tank even pulls?!?
---
We must be the same person because this is exactly what I've gone through and ended up doing too. Shaman is amazing!
---
ah thank you man i appreciate the gesture too :)
---
As a spriest I fuck mages daily.
---
"The Scenic Tour"
---
That's totally fine. I was just commenting on the reason you mentioned why you don't like to twink, since you said you don't play rogues or warriors and feel it's not fun to go against them as a caster at that  level. I assume there are other reasons as well. Just wanted to let you know that that's a non issue if you are afraid of that. Because there are many priest and hunter twinks as well which do just as well. And hunters can destroy warriors or rogues even the pvp twink ones.
---
Get fucked
---
Why is it so hard for people to join a group and operate like a team. Just communicate with your team.  The rest will come. Can I get an amen?
---
I used to wait for goty editions, but bl1 was top notch and I expected reasonable expansions from them, not day one dlc. And this was around the time goty editions stopped offering the full content, and they were being phased out into season passes. Seems to me it's still too complicated to get a full game these days. That's probably why I only play a few games where I either know what I'm getting, or already have it. Most of the games I play now, I've been playing for years, PoE even keeps putting out new content for free. Csgo gets updated occasionally. And dark souls has never let me down.
---
I'm going to be crucified for this, but I personally find SoCasino a bit over-rated.  It really only surpassed SoR if you have a very slow 2her (which is hard to guarantee while leveling) or get super lucky with procs.  For that reason I have been leveling down the Holy tree, switching between 2h and Sword+Board based on what upgrades I get.  Having Consecration allows you to tank early dungeons, if you so desire, and while its probably not feasible to spam it on CD at level 20, once you get some decent gear (and Seal of Wisdom), it can help you clear groups faster.
---
Did I shit on you? Did I say you cant have an opinion?
---
I just find it hilarious that the one other class consistently capable of these kinds of 1vX plays finds mages so broken.
---
I feel like YouTube and twitch having vods of these massive aoe strats is the reason for it
---
uwu
---
Yup. I'll hellfire down about half health OR until I pull aggro. At which point I'm all "oopsie. ah fuck fuck fuck. Siphon up. Drain life... Cmon tank, taunt these fuckers already..."
---
Vanilla trinket no thx. Warrior one doesn't remove sheep, blind or seduce. Pathetic balance
---
So you're in this guild? What server are you guys on?
---
cant mobs resist vanish? or I might be remembering wrong.
---
You can make your own groups that aren’t either of those.
---
And to add, don't put thorns on your dps. You don't want them to have any chance of ripping threat off of the tank.
---
man, we did uldaman and we had a warlock. we summoned first person to badlanss just to leave at instant untik our party were full
---
id say it will get less expensive, bcause more ppl will have t1 so looting wont be as difficult as now. Plus, 400 gold for a glorified prébis is ludacris.
---
Aye, that'd be a perfectly acceptable compromise between the two for me. It's not so much the get-teleported-to-the-dungeon bit of dungeon finder that I miss, it's the make-it-less-of-a-pain-in-the-ass-to-put-together-a-group part that I miss. I'm good with having to get there on foot, and I'm good with the quests being scattered about the world instead of inside the dungeon itself, and I'm good with not being able to group with people on other servers. I just hate having to constantly say LFG/LFM in chat.
---
People take underleveled characters into dungeons all the time.
---
They're the only hybrid class that can tank and DPS effectively with no alleged "hybrid tax", which means when the DPS warriors get geared enough they can PvP with their raid gear and wreck everyone.  It's gonna get worse when the casual players jumping in for nostalgia leave and the people who rolled hybrid classes expecting them to be viable in multiple roles discover their class is gimped in everything but healing and reroll.  You'll see pretty much Mage/Warrior/Rogue and smatterings of other classes, mostly alts, for healing roles in raids, just like Vanilla private servers.
---
Doing this now at 50, building both a tank and healer set because I'll be running a HotW (0/30/21) spec at 60. Most pre bis tank gear you'll have no competition for (we share share a few things like bracers/boots with rogues) but as for healing gear, just let the healer in your group know that you'll be rolling for x item during this run. Make it super clear before you even start heading to the instance!
---
I don’t think you can macro pet attack to something like hunter mark anymore.  I tried to get something like that to work and it never does.  If anyone has a proven working in the game now version it would be helpful.
---
It's older than WoW. LFG is looking for group, an individual trying to get into a party. LFM is looking for more, a party leader asking for players to join
---
Druids in particular are especially great in the beginning phases. However, druids are the worst pvp class once everyone gets geared. Everyone will stomp you once AQ and Naxx gear comes out. They do not benefit from gear like the other classes and druids need to win by attrition. You can't win at all against Tier geared classes because they will just one shot you and ruin your strategy.
---
Swipe is a rage dump. It's not used for threat gen because it doesn't hold a candle (even in aoe situations) to tab target mauling and using faerie fire on cd. It's good damage, but if all you're using is swipe and no maul then you won't hold threat.
---
Good advice.  Keep in mind that not all mobs are the same though.  Anvilrage Soldiers in BRD cleave 360, and bone constructs in scholo have sweeping strikes.  Sometimes you'll have to CC or back out to bandage.
---
I sold mine for 10 the other day. Really helped my mount cause.
---
Type that in google.
---
He delayed a member of the opposing faction from getting a BiS weapon.
---
Yeah at this point I have 2 complete sets of gear for DPS and Tanking.
---
DPS favoring Crit, Str, Attack power.  Tanking favoring Defense/Avoidance, Stamina, Str.
---
got it, thanks!
---
dude fuck pc police and internet rage baiters, self-censoring by social media is pissing me off so much
---
Yes, I noticed how bad it is. That's why I transferred to Hearrseeker
---
I guess they merged the different PvP BG factions marks into one for classic, but it doesn't have too much confirmation either way.  
---
They wouldn't be bind on account, though. I don't think that affix existed in classic.
---
Without am 'Armory-like' site there no real way to know who has cleared what and how many times without directly asking or people posting logs on 3rd party sites. Even then, I recall some guilds would swap out their gear so they could not be Inspected or have Armory be updated to reveal where they were on progression, during server progressions vs other guilds before.
---
Gnome is better but dwarf is sick.
---
People back in vanilla didn't know this when they started playing, and very few people rerolled after discovering the best race for things and then got r14.
---
Im a shadow priest level 45. I recently got rid of my robes of Arugal and the shoulders, but I'm still using the Belt of Arugal. Honestly there just aren't many upgrades for cloth robes and shoulders 30-40 (from quest rewards or SM). The Inquisitors Shawl from SM Cath is a solid piece I got, you have to kill the "hidden" boss for them. For new robes I used tailoring to make Robe of Power. There's a piece called Robe of the Magi that I saw in a random chest in RFD. I needed it, but so did a warrior who "needed mount money sorry :)". You can find this on the AH. 
---
All in all though, I wouldn't stress too much over these upgrades. The gear from SFK is way ahead of it's level and is still good 10-15-20 levels later
---
So the rotation is basically the same as swords except you prioritize Kindey Shot over Slice n Dice?
---
Gratz!
---
Awesome thank you so much
---
Could be ShadowedUnitFrames. It won't look like those frames by default though. If it is indeed SUF, he customized them quite a bit.
---
Use /1 instead of /2?
---
I'm full ret and heal with just int gear. Doing fine at level 45 still
---
Top kek
---
It's a bot. It will respond to "Nice" with "Nice", "nice" with "nice", "Nice." with "Nice." etc.
---
There is a black lotus spoot that have a high spawn rate and time. Happy hunting

Look at the stuff you can buy that'll give you a definitive answer

Hi, /u/TataIgreReal

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9m75n/play_together_discord/). 
---
Disenchanting starter gear
---
Some see a bandwagon cruising by and just gotta jump right on it.
---
I tap after a fight to get full mana IF the tank keeps pulling, if I have time I will bandage myself to a reasonable level of HP before joining back in. I'm not going to not be fighting when the rest of the group is fighting.
---
But if they stop to let the healer drink I will tap till my hp and mana are about the same then I will eat and drink as its faster than just drinking with full health.
---
What a lot of non warlocks don't realize is we are required to lifetap due to how costly our shadowbolt is vs how much mana we have. So if you want me to do damage, I need to lifetap. If I'm in a pug and a healer refuses to heal me, I leave, as I would assume any other class would if they were not healed. If the healer refuses to heal the melee or the tank the healer would be removed for one that does their job, why would it be any different for healing a warlock?
---
Always repair and refill your ammo before a dungeon!!
---
Source: I have both run out of arrows and had my bow break.  Embarrassing!!
---
Imp sap requires to go deep in a shitty dps tree.. Trust me, when we're at 60 its not gonna happen 90% of the time.
---
Also, since i always group with the same people, i SAP w/o the talent anyway. We time the sap with sheep and warr charge pull.
---
Pretty sure it was an add-on in vanilla
---
Repair bots.
---
gay
---
Thats why I almost always am party leader. I get there by mount and then summon my minions..or party members
---
I got more "pet aggroes half Gromeregan" and "multishot is in my rotation" than aoe mages. I disagree.
---
Oh, I got that Dragonslayer buff randomly while in SW. Is it an aoe buff that someone has to make?
---
Well if you will join a “spell cleave” run
---
elv and tukui can change every font in the game if youre using that.
---
but hes trying really hard, playing 14 hours every single day, its not his fault that classic is hard
---
I would recommend 5\5 Divine Str or Int and 5\5  Spiritual Focus for all leveling Pallies, regardless of spec.  
---
It's not super important to spec Holy for healing low-level dungeons (just keep a set of Int gear and you're good), but if you want to focus more on healing than melee, the main talents you want next are 3\3 Healing Light, 5\5 Illumination, and 1\1 Divine Favor.  The remaining two points are a toss-up - maybe Imp LoH or Unyielding Faith, if you don't want Consecrate for off-tanking.
---
You can keep going for 5\5 Holy Power and 1\1 Holy Shock, but as long as you have the core 21 points in Holy you should be fine for healing most content.  You can then focus on dps or tanking talents for solo plat, etc.
---
If you farm the right stuff you can make bank on the AH too.
---
Mage is the new hunter(noob class) in classic. Hunters are actually relatively uncommon at max level these days. There are certainly good mages, but the majority are just terrible.
---
Consider that +Healing allows you to downrank heals for mana efficiency (heal the same as a higher rank with a lower rank spell).  I very much doubt int is 1.16 +healing.  Thats way too high in my opinion.
---
&gt; [Level of next rank] + 4) / [Character Level] * [Spell Coefficient] = [Downranking Coefficient]
---
The only spell that's being effected by this honestly is heal rank 1.  I have tested heal rank 2 and it's not being effected by it at least.  You also have the mana cost of heal rank 1 wrong.
---
Priest vs paladin. Which would make for a better main class? I feel like a paladin offers more versatility whereas a priest is better in what it does
---
I guess I did miss the tanking thread. I'm a casual Reddit user. But I agree. The elitist attitudes is at an all time high. I feel like a lot of these people are players coming from later expansions in retail and truly not understanding threat because they never had to.
---
You really need to be 35+ for bonebiter.  You need to kill everything in SM and without getting carried that can be tough.
---
It buffs most of stormwind and it has a 6 hours cooldown. You get it when you turn in the head of onyxia which duh drops from onyxia at 100% rate.
---
ok
---
nah horde here is pretty much the larger faction on the server
---
Oh, so fun fact... there’s actually a setting that allows click through on your target frame. But I don’t think I’ve even enabled that... I never seem to have a problem though.
---
You should level solo warrior while you have a chance. Like now :)
---
Thats a good theory when you are ready for the fight and might be at 100% health and mana. But rogues dont fight like that. They backstab you when you are at your weakest. You have literal seconds before you are dead. You are stunned and stabbed to death in 3 seconds even if almost at full health if you meet a rogue who is a few lvls higher. Which is what has happened countless times for me. Druids are too squishy and no good instant counters/protection for the gank/backstab like many other classes have. We have a shitty barkskin for 20% protection or entangle. No instant teleport away or magic shield.
---
I bought it. I havent had the opportunity to run Strat Living yet, and I had the money so i decided to splurge.
---
Keep in mind that the training points that you get are limited so you can't teach your pet everything. Even if your pet has a lot of abilities, some of them might not be worth it to train. For example, cower is not an ability that you would like to train. 
---
Also keep in mind that your pet has a specific amount of focus to spend so you might want to spend your points on abilities that are important for you. To go back to my owl example, you might prefer not to teach your owl the claw ability since you might want to use screech as your "focus dampening ability" since it is basically a mini demoralizing shout that can hold aggro on multiple targets. Or if you want to PVP some while you're leveling you should consider getting Dive for your owl (which is basically the owl version of a sprint/dash).
---
You can research this online (there are tons of articles and reddit posts from the private servers with extensive analysis on pets and abilities) or you can experiment with different abilities and see what works best for you (thankfully respec for pet is not that expensive).
---
This is the correct answer
---
When people say that I think they are referring to the dungeons and raids.
---
Solo questing at higher levels can be pretty difficult depending on your class/gear.
---
I say this as a shaman whose friends quickly outpaced me in level and I'm having some difficulties with some quests.
---
Mage AOE DPS is definitely better. But a lot of groups will take one warlock for their utility (summons, soulstone, etc) and they're the second best AOE class when specced for it
---
&gt;Valley of Trials
---
2 days ago actually, there's a ZF quest that you turn in at Sen'jin and then I ran through Valley of Trials, took the hidden path to Ratchet
---
Pick up the mobs ranged have, save taunt for mobs that have taken a lot of damage, and just overall improve your gameplay. But no dungeon tanking you don't have 100% control,you just wing it and tank as much as you can.
---
Wouldt mind having BE back in something like Classic +. Without the paladin class.
---
A smart one is going to keep a fire dot on you to prevent vanish, if possible. 
---
If you have prep, you're probably OK.
---
I have the chronicles books and one book about Illidan and they are good. Haven’t read the third chronicle book yet though.
---
There will be some early quests you aren't offered. 
---
I usually do the 1-5 leveling starter area before moving to wherever I want to level.
---
And if you are a class that an orc can't be, there won't be a trainer in the early zones.
---
You mean you don't want increased threat reduction... in the rogue subtlety tree?
---
I don't care if they're BiS. I'm not farming ST Balcony bosses for an item that then need to roll the correct stats.
---
Browsing the talent tree, I think I'd have to mostly agree with you. As I said, I've only picked up Divine Strength in Holy so far. I think I'm gonna get improved SoR, Consecrate and Healing Light. Then full Ret.
---
Appreciate the advice
---
Look on your server's discord.
---
Thanks! That's a cool feature
---
I completely believe you, honestly. If you happen to prefer fighting as a geared 29 vs another geared 29 instead of at 60 there’s nothing wrong with that. However, if most of the other twinks shared your outlook, they would have kept queing and the times wouldn’t have gotten unbearable in the xp off brackets.
---
People expecting there to be actual new content added to classic. As if it isn't just a cash grab. It'll either get shuffled into a new xpac, wiped, or nothing will change. 🙃🙃🙃
---
Like no one who plays Alliance has ever degraded the experience of others? Okaaaaaaay.
---
Sensationalist propaganda at it's finest folks!
---
You had a point, then killed it when you tried to generalize people with your point.
---
undercity reservists has more dps.

I'm going 0/30/21 for this exact reason. Right now I'm just at the 0/30/0 part.

The 20% int is more than enough at level 40 to make you a competent healer. And, unlike some other people in this chat seem to believe, it's not hard at all to get yourself a healing offset. Costs maybe 10g to buy whatever greens/blues you don't already have from questing and dungeons. It's not hard to get a set of gear.
---
Fucking right?  And they dont even wait 2 seconds to grab aggro.   Just immediately aoe like it's fucking bfa or some shit.
---
It is significantly better.  WW axe has higher dps, higher topend, better stats.  As a warrior, when using a 2h, you want a weapon with higher topend damage if they dps is close.  Higher topend means harder average hits.
---
At 39 if I were you I would just re roll and level in night elf zones. I enrolled at 32 to do it. You will save your self a ton of time and money if you just re roll and quest and get rep the right way.
---
Otherwise you'll be adding in x10 more effort anyways farming money to buy runecloth.
---
Lua the same
---
It should also be noted that when the mob parries an attack, its next attack will be faster (or I think come out immediately?). So the melee dps standing in front of the mob increases the mob’s dps on the tank.
---
Respec costs aren't consistent with every class though. A gold sink that punishes some classes more than others, arbitrarily, isn't a good mechanic.
---
Oh man 500g
---
Someone knows how to AH...
---
It's called handwriting
---
Hell you can tank mc and onyxia.
---
Recount does this, it differentiates between all sources of damage
---
Seems to be enabled so I don't think it's that.
---
So, what's your classic/vanilla PVE progress then?
---
My playstyle is on the side of an MMO but with the exception of grinding or questing I like the challenge of winning by myself, to push my character and my skills. And yes, that means killing Hogger solo at level 10 with the use of potions, items that reduce hit chance, using cooldowns, etc. I don't mind grouping for the truly difficult stuff and dungeons, but I feel overall people try to make this game too easy on themselves.
---
To be clear, I don't ninja loot and I do buff and help people all the time. I obviously know I can't get mad when it happens, but it's irritating when I'm trying to solo something and someone throws a heal right as I use a potion.
---
Do you really not understand why someone would want to clear MC in 2 hours vs 4 hours???  
---
Imagine in real life if you decided to drive a route that took an hour to get to work instead of the route that takes only 30mins.  I mean, there's 24 hours a day and you have to fill that time somehow.....    Do you see how crazy that sounds? Lol
---
Hit me  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  very hard.
---
It won't happen. This is worse than just straight up fighting her. She does an AoE attack that causes her to stand in place. If you are a class that can heal (like this Druid) you simply fight her in melee, then run out and heal when she does her AoE.
---
Did you mean spirit res?  Because I dont think you meant battle res
---
Are you sure you're not using intimidate? That also taunts.
---
It must be memory failing me again then, didnt touch my Lock for 3 years now since Elysium
---
Most proper routes build in a bit of grinding as part of the route, or even natively if you get bad rng on quest items.
---
Good rule of thumb is just kill stuff while travelling, you'll probably not outpace quests.
---
Yeah, as a tank I fucking hate mages in Classic, which is mind blowing because I loved having mages back in the day.  Now I'd rather have a melee cleave group than a normal group with a single mage.
---
.#NotaRealTwink cuz different than me! Let's be real, most twinks do it to feel like a badass vs low levels in BGs. Deny the truth all u like lol
---
The first three books were out already, and the fourth would be in 2005.
---
Love these, these are the kind of things I would like to see in future classic updates. I've always wanted something like Bloodsail Bay as a pirate safe haven, a reputation city. If you get like revered you get access to special flight paths/recipes/items and things like that in the headquarters. I also think it's genius to add onto coastal areas as well (especially northern Kalimdor), since you can keep a lot of the main continent intact without affecting it too much with gigantic additions or having to add islands.
---
The Verdant Breach is pretty awesome, I've always wondered what could go there. The idea I had was to have Wildwind Lake from Feralas drain into there, with a blockage near the entrance to Thousand Needles so you could see where it stopped getting water long ago. Would add a little more flare to the fact it used to have a water source before the shimmering flats dried up long ago. Would play these zones in classic+ for sure.
---
OMG this hahaha
---
I, unfortunately don't have time to read through all of the responses. But I see a trend of,"I need to take more damage, to do more damage, in order to generate threat."
---
Why are so many discounting threat generating abilities that do little to no damage, like sunder, taunt and revenge?
---
Why do people find the need to blame others instead of themselves.  This is your fault. I know when my game time expires because I looked.
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
And the right stuff just depends on how many others are doing the same on your given server.
---
You're exactly right about both, but neither is a 'better' main class.
---
Yeah that's what I attribute it to.  I figured well I'm first wave of levelers so everyone at my level probably isn't likely to gank me because they're going hard to level.
---
This was my understanding as well
---
Need multiple recommendations for good gold farming spots for levels 36-40
---
&gt;Never seen nipple and star used on mobs
---
Alright, I feel like I’m taking crazy pills or something.  Because I haven’t played in a while, and it had been an even longer while before that since CC was actually a done thing, but... I swear to god it used to be universally understood that star was sap.  I play a rogue, and now on classic people are just fucking using anything, sap the diamond, sap the square, sap the nipple, whatever.  And I’m just so confused.  Was this just my server, or maybe even just my guild or something?  Star is sap damn it :(
---
Not all mages (I feel like that should be a hashtag...) fall into the "dickhead" category, but if you're the kind of person who's out to be the strongest he can personally be and fuck everybody else you probably, with the current twitch meta, picked a mage.
---
I’ve seen other posts like this.
---
Or they just put a rock or something on their move forward key, that bannable too?
---
They are accurate, you need to be mindful of the item quantity, I believe it multiplies for you.
---
Am I the only one that thinks that this new "Women can\`t be sexy" trend in video game is regressive? Theres plenty of irl women who dress sexy. Its disguised slut shaming.
---
I rolled an undead priest and walked to org as soon as I could because I like the barrens quests. I haven't seen any reprecussions.
---
This always reads as someone who is just viscously violent to everyone, not some sort of quippy statement on gender equality.
---
Holy shit. I had completely forgot about that. Oh no.......
---
So you survived long enough for the warlock to kill everything for you. Cool.
---
I've been bopping shit for 3 instances between heals and can't make much progress past 240. Think I'm at 255?
---
Does anyone have a good list of +healing items. I'm lvl 46 priest and I feel I need some better +healing for dungeons. Just got all the Dreamweaves and haven't run one yet but I could use maybe a good dagger and off hand with some +healing though I do love The Illusionary Staff. Google is only giving me lists for BiS and not for lower levels. Help appreciated :)
---
I mean almost never. No one backs off so they don't take aggro. Half of being a dps is aggro management. Especially while leveling because the tank won't either be specd for it or have the gear for a dps to always go big dick.
---
I have every single one of my skills trained cus i'm not poor.
---
I hated that game, specifically for the story. I hated being forced to play a character who was making choices I didn't want them to make. Same with Kerrigan in Starcraft. Ruined those games for me. It's fine to play the villain, but let me choose. Usually I'll be the good guy on first play through, and bad guy on second. The lack of choice made me feel bad, and I stopped playing. Even though the WoW story is still lacking choice, at least I'm not committing atrocities.
---
were there really that many bans issued that it's obliterating queue times? I thought maybe the 24/7 playtime of the game just evaporated and people got back to normal lives and just a few hours of WoW here and there.
---
It's just way too much waiting for me. You need to go to a location? 15 minutes of running. You need that named mob? 15 minutes of waiting for it to spawn, then compete for a tag with 3 other groups (at least its down from 30 on release). You need to get 15 jewpacabra hooves? well guess what, only 1 in 6 jewpacabras grow these, and only 6 of them spawn. Now farm these for 2 hours straight. Just remember that every 2 you kill you need to drink for 40 seconds. Oh, you pulled 3, now you're running to your body for 7 minutes. 
---
I do enjoy the RPG feel it has to it. I do like the fact that there is no warforging, no endless azerite grind, and that mobs dont die by being sneezed on. I also enjoy the class fantasy, the fact that not everyone has everything, and classes are actually different in what they do. I also like the fact that professions matter, and gold is a thing. I actually enjoy a lot of it, it's just the things I dislike I dislike way more than I like the things I like.
---
Ok, this is awesome. Thanks for helping the community out.
---
Looks like it requires Dire Maul, so it won't be available until phase 2.
---
Me neither. Playing alliance on Netherwind and haven't seen a single one yet, at least that I remember.
---
&gt;When you are wandering the world and see that red nameplate with low HP fighting a mob, suppress the desire to bonk them on the head and waste 10 minutes of their time on a corpse run
---
No. This is going beyond having empathy and going into the realm of moralistic bullshit that actively ignores what is happening in the game design. Which isn't to say that you specifically *should* kill a 10% HP enemy that's fighting a mob. However, if the enemy is flagged for PvP, they have already accepted it.
---
Going out of your way to be a super cool bro to random enemies is not a norm and it is not expected. It's a symptom of the modern "all are one" brainwashing.
---
True
---
Prepare for more disappointment until possibly late AQ but more than likely naxx. The game changed a lot through all the patches and classes in 1.12 are a lot more powerful than in previous patches.
---
you aren't kidding, yesterday my wife left me and took the kids too! haha! almost 60 soon though
---
Yeah, I'd write ASOIAF, but I found GoT simpler ;)
---
Why do you need an armored column (pt of warriors) for a lil old rogue?
---
We still need heals!  Cheap mana hots are the best :)
---
Source on gen chat being layered? 
---
I ask because several times I've seen a rogue post picking locks on AH bridge, yet they are not there and must be invited/invite me in order to join layers then pick the lock.
---
Blizzard with their unnatural standards for ladies back in the day.
---
Devilsaur gauntlets and leggings
---
Anyone know if that enclave of people who hated bfa on launch that moved to FF XIV has also come back to classic? I heard the FF players are pretty sick of dealing with the WoW refugees.
---
Classic is not hard.
---
WoW has never been hard.
---
WoW has always been the "easy" MMO.
---
Accept but this, and you shall be free of your delusions.
---
I’m also new, did something similar until I realized there was an auto run button lol
---
It's a flat number, 605-606 or 604-605. Will be the same at 60, so it gets less lethal. Esp. if you lava jump to avoid some of the ticks.
---
I don't trust your gut either
---
FYI this resets whatever profession you drop. If you want to switch back you start from zero.
---
See. This right here is the type of closed minded shit that plagued vanilla.
---
I went Skinning/Mining while leveling. Skinning is an absolute must IMO for gold. I dropped mining at level 40 for tailoring and it's only cost me a few gold to get it to level 200. Tailoring is required for one of the pre-bis items, and lots of the other items are nice to have. 
---
Not sure what I'll drop skinning for yet.
---
Had Luminary Kilt drop (Leather spell dmg/int/stam leg piece). I said in chat that is a good LEATHER caster piece and the mage still rolled and won it before realizing that it was not cloth. Honestly, at this point I'm thinking mage is the new hunter.
---
According to the statweights I use, it's 140% as good as Tier 1.
---
Honestly every class is the noob class nowadays, because there are vastly more noobs distributed across all classes in classic from my experience
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I got it at level 30 a few weeks back. The fast speed chewed through arrows but it was by far the best option for me and I didn’t have aimed shit yet so I didn’t have cliping issues.
---
Sounds good to me, Benediction is a really good talent for leveling in the Ret tree and thankfully right at the top.
---
I mean some classes were doing this at 52...
---
Yah I'm failing. 28 hunter, 18 paladin, 12 priest. These are all very difficult to solo
---
I rolled a mage because I love the class and always envied them way back when I first started.  I rolled a warrior because that was my main back when I started playing.  Feelsbadman
---
This video isn't entitled "nobody else in the world helps me and i show my best plays ever made".
---
I will wipe the floor with you. 
---
Thanks.
---
Yep, can't fix stupid.  Only experience can do that.
---
Bug exploiting at its finest.  It appears that many are reporting the exploiters and I hope the ban becomes permanent.
---
You should of let him. You don’t loose durability if you die from a player
---
Quite the generalization you have there.
---
You seem to not know that yes, in fact tanks can't do their jobs well unless the dps do their job as well.
---
Losing aggro doesn't actually have much to do with the tank, just how bad the dps are.
---
And yet you say ALL tanks who complain are bad.
---
Repeatable quests aren't the same as regular questing.
---
You wanna show off your wealth with BLING!
---
How on earth is this Blizzard fault?
---
May have been now that you mention it, but it just seems like it was integrated.
---
I've started 2h tanking on my warrior because dps just have no idea how to let me build some initial threat. Swap to sword and board for bosses. Works infinitely better and my healer is premade so he doesn't mind the extra bit of damage I take.
---
Charge in, hit rage generators, drop a WW/Cleave, sweeping strikes and swap defensive for the occasional taunt. Rinse repeat. Saves time with the added damage and makes holding threat way easier, at least in the upper 30s where I'm at.
---
awww fudge lol, i was planning on making those for me.
---
yes, first run through there. The second and third runs though, the blind hunter wasn't there.
---
we used to farm it for rogues and warrior twinks.
---
Oh yeah that's right.. It's just that every healing priest is going to have the talent that reduces mana cost by 15% which actually helps mana efficiency of greater heal more.
---
I see what you did there!
---
I love classic.  The demand for the official support/release appears to have not been purely fueled by nostalgia.  The sense of community and place enforced by the difficulty is what I've been missing in my modern MMO gameplay.  Having to wait to get your full class toolkit.  Making meaningful specialization choices.  All of it together makes for something just a little bit magical.  I've just hit 52 this morning before work, and I'm really looking forward to some pre-raid BiS dungeon farming.
---
If I'm being 100% honest though... through experiencing classic I really appreciate the modern version of the game for what it is much more.  Both versions have their flaws and merits, but for the same $15 I don't have to choose.
---
Trying to get exalted before you buy your first mount.. ah. You a gnome?
---
I'll take a large dr pepper and a mcchicken
---
Ogres in feralas or bandits in tanaris I think are around that level.
---
Who uses a turtle pet?
---
Coyotes in badlands have a nice loot table, as well as a chance to get staff of jordan. mob density is pretty great there as well.
---
There are some bugged nodes. One I recall in particular was about deadmines. A tin node that never appeared.
---
That’s fishin bud!
---
How is this Blizzard's fault? Your game time includes 30 days. Not 30 days plus finish your raid.
---
But does that really make you feel?
---
Sounds like you have a lot of issues with the players I described or bad run ins with them.
---
Don’t focus too much on that one last example, I’m not promoting some hippy dippy idealism. If you want to think of the opposing faction as the other team and fuck them up all day more power to you. Hopefully you do so with the understanding they will in turn desire to fuck you up, and then the cooperation with your fellow faction mates comes into play for the counterattack
---
No it doesn't.
---
And how! Hit level 56 last night and spec'd prot warrior. I'm hyped
---
Pretty easy downvote.
---
You can have your opinion but your reasoning to that opinion is miscalculated at best.
---
You think Twinks are a waste of money [ as there is no way to turn off exp.]
---
The sole reason for a Twink is to  Battleground and/or duel, neither of which grant you exp.
---
If you still think your opinion is sound, what would you use a Twink for, where you’d need to turn off exp?
---
I think a more reasonable reason to dislike twinks are: 
---
Arguably, the skill ceiling is lower than their 60 counterparts (more abilities and less TTK).
---
There is no progression once you finish, just satisfaction to kill.
---
Which brings me to a more important reason as to why you [may] dislike twinks. You may not be that taxonomy of player.
---
https://youtu.be/yxpW2ltDNow
---
Maybe you like to explore/achieve more. Twinks like to kill, pure and simple.
---
We are not butthurt by your rebuttal, we just think your reasoning is miscalculated and therefore we try to help calculate your perception of things. 
---
Please don’t disregard what people say because you think it’s just your opinion. That only hinders you from educating yourself.
---
I apologize if I sounded rude or if I came off as insulted (I dont have a Twink), I just care for other’s opinion including yours and the perspective of many.
---
Back in Vanilla when an Arathi Basin or Alterac Valley match was obviously a loss, my dwarf paladin would strip down to some overalls, a pink mageweave shirt and  russet hat and just fish in those BGs lol.
---
I would very rarely get killed and had some regular horde friends that would fish next to me too!
---
TICK TOCK MAGES
---
I did 40-41 in badlands and it was pretty quick and easy, most of the quests are kill 10+ of X or collect X sorta rare drops. Depending on what you’ve done already STV has some good ones too.
---
The worgs in SFK have 1.2 attack speed and have the same model as deathmaw too! Lots of good options. 1.2 is plenty to keep frenzy up. Broken tooth is only marginally better for pvp
---
I'd try either 31/5/15 or something along the lines of 0/31/20 (a few flex points in that talent build that can go in either tree). First build for some PvP, second build for PvE only.
---
You lose a bit of damage compared to a full on 31/20 or 17/34 DPS build, but you gain some decent tanking ability for 5-mans and as Offtank in raids. With a bit of gear you can easily tank all non-raid dungeons and offtank in all raids. 
---
You can also tank every dungeon and offtank in raids with a full on DPS spec, but you're a bit harder to heal and lack some utility. Tanking heavy hitters without the improved shield block value point can get you critted down, which might be rare but sucks quite a bit when it happens.
---
They are basically all gnome or dwarf, bcause of pvp racials. They dont care about Pve racials at all.
---
This! And they dont have to be for lvl 60 imo. Would be nice to have new interesting places to level in :)
---
Downvote me as much as you wish, anyways I don’t expect any explanation from you on how you’re going to gang an invisible character that can just stay 5 kilometres away laughing their ass off. It is basically the waste of time and guys asking for help against rogues are pathetic and selfish. Just change your location and keep questing somewhere else, no big deal.
---
Haha fair points, i can see why you feel that way. :)
---
The game is obviously far from balanced and many things don't make sense. Even back then the problems were evident, but in those days Blizzard always took forever to change anything - even game breaking bugs sometimes took weeks to fix, unless it was something easily abusable.
---
If you want to fix things about classic, then why not take it all the way and switch to 2.0? But then it's a completely different game and best left for another time.
---
Make sure you do the gathering in felwood the food there/pots have saved me so much gold
---
This is why you and I have rolled warlocks.  They'll never see us coming until its too late!!
---
Can we get this? Asking for a friend
---
Mining/skinning or herb/skinning.
---
Now I'm super confused because I thought taunt and threat were the same?  What's the difference?
---
Second shit post within the last few hours...?

This is bad advice. Dark pact isn't worth giving up Ruin. Sure it's nice but you have life tap - you don't need it.

ESO is one of those games that I was expecting much worse from but it was still a fairly average game.

There are a couple visual console commands, I cant remember what they are but one lets you set ground clutter radius as far as you want rather than in a 20-30yd radius around your toon.
---
This will give the screenshots more detail in the far off parts of the world rather than everything only being in detail near you then being plain 40+ feet away.
---
I believe you can change lighting and weather effects as well as LoD.
---
This is really interesting! Thank you so much for your honesty. I do indeed feel like that a paladin offers a bit more. A bit of tanking here and there, and plate armour. Do you enjoy playing your priest?
---
Really nice addition to the conversation, thanks for sharing
---
Given that when twink bracketing was created on retail the entire twink scene basically died... people like you were not the norm.
---
Twinks always have and always will be about open flex and overpowering bgs.
---
It’s because their original rebuttal fit OPs question. Then we questioned their opinion. We knew they didn’t like Twinks and had nothing to do with a waste of money.
---
In other words, a classic case of being **misinformed.**
---
I've had so many mages run away from the group when they get scared. It would be hilarious if it wasn't so frustrating.
---
Ugh
---
Sometimes the highest rank you have isnt the most mana efficient. You should be casting the most mana efficient healing spell you have unless someone needs a big heal, at which point you cast the best.
---
Doesn't it automatically charge you again? It's a subscription!
---
Even if the Priest talented for +hit, yeah his miss and resisted dot ticks will be a burden to the group if DPS isn't making up for it. Even talented for +hit, I get frustrated at bosses 5 levels above me - which can happen with duns like SFK and Ulda (Ulda being esp bad since the first time you run into a DPS check with the adds healing the boss.)

Remember to always ask if in doubt, dont assume.
---
I keybind my auto run to the middle mouse button. It is the most commonly used hot key I have.
---
Yes. I've been pigeonholed into tanking every dungeon so far (or risk waiting an hour to find one), and I literally won't join a group with mages/won't accept them when I form groups. Every single one has been non-communicative, pulling for me, spamming Blizzard before sunders go out. It's infuriating.

Same. If we are in a dungeon and there’s no marks, down the first target I hit on the pull, don’t tab around with me
---
Considering players may have keys (as a blacksmith I always have some), I usually just have people roll.
---
Of course there's always the off chance that the rogue botches the unlock and autoloots the whole thing, but that's a chance I'm willing to take.
---
Charge in, TC the pack, dance to defensive, demo.  That will hold off threat pulls from healing.  At that point determine which mob your DPS is going ham on.  Don't even bother trying to generate a ton of threat on this one just taunt it once it stops looking at you.  From there try and tab sunder to generate threat on the others.  Sometimes your DPS like to split their focus and that can be a chore but just taunt the one which isn't getting a snare on it (ie; the rogue's target) and let the snared one go free if you can't control it.

I'm almost certain pug groups in the future will still have trouble at least from BWL on and higher raids. The vast majority of people haven't even hit 60 yet. Most are still around level 30-50 from my observation. I'm still level 53 as well and I've been playing every single day since release. Though I'm a prot tank so leveling is awfully slow of course. Once the majority of players hit 60 and phase 2 releases (does BWL come in phase 2?) then we will know more. Obviously experienced raiding guilds, especially private server guilds will just clear every raid tier in week 1, assuming that they'll have the gear for Naxx as that will still have a certain degree of gear check. Can't just put a tank that has blue gear in front of Patchwerk.
---
Well k think people do know, and it is a valid point. We'll just have to see what blizz will do next. I hope they go a new direction with xpacs but keep tue to the formula that classic uses and not transform it into retail 2.0
---
Haha human males are such terrible models in classic
---
I'm currently Lv33 with 210 fishing and about 32G.  Greater Sagefish have been consistently and I'm making gold money from the chests that I get occasionally (I keep praying I get a 14 slot backpack from them)
---
I wish there was an option to not also pay for retail WoW and also that there'd be an option to only play with people from pservers, not retail players. All the retail players I have met so far seem to be of the "I have no time, let's gogogogogo" kind and they act like a 12 year old who has had too much sugar. On pserver people were so chill, I really miss that.
---

Why didnt you just roll pve? That's Heartseekers future...
---
Say you haven't trained lockpicking enough, then run and grab it all after the dungeon is done.
---
In reality, there's no real consensus. Offer to roll if you want to be a nice guy, but most players don't really care that much, the chest usually isn't that great.
---
Yep. Apply dots, apply curse of tongues, you pretty much already won. Reapply curse as needed.
---
DAE lvl 6 1 month in just keep dying LOL XD
---
Not very much content in TBC requires flying and none of it is leveling content as TBC required 70 for flying (or 78 if you were a druid)
---
 
---
Elemental Plateau, netherstorm dungeons, Kazzak, Skettis, Ogri'la and Netherwing ledge are the only places I can think inaccessible without flying and most of these could be fixed with short mini flight paths or blood elf teleporters (or some slight terrain adjustment for kazzak). The only that would really need changing is the dailies at skettis, netherwing and ogrila which were targeted towards flying (netherwing and gorilla weren’t in release anyways).
---
I agree WotLK presents way more complications. Two zones require flying and the entire expansion uses phasing throughout it which I absolutely do not want. Even then though there is a ton of stuff they can use, from most art assets and most of the continent to all the dungeons and that is way less dev work than developing a new continent from scratch.
---
I didnt but ok!
---
Go to the town east in tanaris and just above it there is a small house that has a book for you to click, will let you choose gnomish or goblin engineering

What’s ur elite dragon portrait addon?

we have a whole expansion built upon this? Azerite! /s

Would that have counted in this scenario?  I would have died from falling and not 100% player damage I don't know how the game calculates it
---
Good idea if it does though haha
---
Ah, looks like I got mixed up there. I somehow read general, typed gen chat, yet was referring to trade the entire time. 
---
Yeah I'd agree with that, I've yet to encounter a situation where /1, /y has been layered.
---
&gt; In the Hillsbrad area, Alliance seems to be uncaring of equal levels but will gank if they are red or skulls to you.
---
Because Alliance get sent to Hillsbrad at a higher level, S'why they don't care about equal levels. You shouldn't really see any equal level alliance there unless they're bored, or going to SFK.
---
Yeah between silence, drain life, drain mana, dots, and fear... That one can get a little one-sided.
---
Very first start of chain quest, I think, is from the dwarf you need to escort, gets killed after escort. Dwarf is at southeast of Searing Gorge, just off the path from Badlands.
---
Were you in the group i healed? Grobbulus?
---
My warlock is level 28. Should I be drain tanking even now?
---
Seems like some people are discussing level 40+ strategies.
---
Do you really believe that telling karma whores to stop whoring will have any effect?
---
Protip: it won't. So what can you do?
---
If they are blatant reposts you can report them because it's against the sub rules (n. 7).
---
Otherwise you can downvote them and move on. Having whores losing preciouss whore points is actually the best thing you can do to limit their spam.
---
I made about 10g yesterday barely playing from fishing, if you’re alliance go to the barrens and there are 3 oasis, each have a fish called deviate fish. I can sell a stack for about 2.5g in the SW auction house. Mobs around are only level 15-20 so it’s pretty safe besides dealing with a couple annoying horde every once in a while but usually people fishing there won’t bother you. Already got 20g and only started leveling my fishing 2 days ago.

I actually realized how good Starshards are for killing things as nelf priest. They don't do as much DPS as smite, but they're FAR more mana efficient, so I can actually farm mobs barely having to drink, wearing healing gear and with no points in spirit tap. Shield -&gt; holy fire -&gt; sw:p -&gt; starshards and wand to death (roughly the same time sw:p expires).
---
Yeah! This is what I normally did when I was 34-40ish, with WW axe. It kind of depends on the healer...I'm 44 now and didn't do Uldaman so I haven't tanked dungeons in a long tome, ZF soon though.
---
Yes please run to me, and don't jump like a fish out of water the other direction.
---
Until they were incrementally nerfed into oblivion in raids and pvp. The only thing they had was rogue mage priest and rogue mage in arena. I mained mage back then.
---
The context was pretty clear. One guy said mages are OP. Someone responded saying warriors are OP. I responded explaining how multiple classes have ways to one shot and it doesn't make anyone OP in vanilla. Stop reading through polar lenses. There are more than two stances on every topic. Taking comments personally and arguing from an emotional standpoint makes that difficult to see. 
---
I play a rogue with prep + improved sprint. I have no problem with mages unless they open on me out of stealth. In no way am I bothered by their ability to do massive amounts of damage. That's their trade-off for having low hp and low armor.
---
thanks so much!!
---
The stoplight example though, is also different. You’ll pull up to me at the stop light, but as soon as it turns green I can accelerate and be gone, as opposed to being stuck behind you or someone else on the stop light that accelerates 0 to 45 for 3 miles.
---
Or those times I don’t get stuck at the light but pass on a yellow. That saves literally 5-10 minutes in some cases
---
Edit: sorry about the edits lol
---
People will still collect the Tier sets just because it's a Class set, even if it just sits in a bag in their bank.
---
I tried explaining to a tank who kept pulling before i got &lt; 5 ticks off my water, that drinks cost a lot (espicislly since i financially drained my self for my lvl 40 mount). His response was literally "what do you mean, just buy some from a mage"
---
To me if someone's doing kidney and that, I take that as a sign that they have the mob under control and pay less attention to tanking it
---
Fair point. However i see people perhaps go play some retail and after that maybe get an alt. But true that endgame is not much to write home about. Classic is all about the leveling experience.
---
You can heal dungeons as straight ret fine, just collect some intellect gear while you level. Since paladins can wear all armor types, this is actually really easy to do.
---
Horde have no reason to go heart seeker pre-honor system.
---
Alli on heartseeker look to be doomed come honor system. 
---
The fault of both is on Blizzard
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/censusplusclassic
---
Seems to work fine.
---
The STM corpse run absolutely sucks as horde.  Good job
---
If you're horde, then you can buy some underwater breathing potions and head to Desolace. There's a repeatable quest there to get some shellfish from the underwater cages, reward is 55s per 5 shellfish. Gets around 10-12g an hour. Boring and very little XP, though.
---
My laptop broke: how should I manage without wow for 1 and a half weeks now?
---
I just don’t get the whole “meta” thing. You don’t have to have the best class with the best build with the best gear to do a random leveling dungeon. 
---
I’ll take a fun group over a meta group any time.
---
This.  I never saw this shit in all of Vanilla.  This is the most ridiculous nonsense.  If you want to reserve an item, get your guild to run with you.
---
As long as you already have your Epic mount, then I don't see an issue with spending that paper.
---
Yeah but as I said, dungeons relieves the monotony of questing and lets you get above the levels of the zone. Then You get blues which are incredibly helpful, especially plate blues. There’s just no reason not to mix that into the rotation
---
Threat is just the mechanic that determines what a monster is currently attacking. Think of threat as a damage meter, but for threat. Sunder armor generates a large amount of threat despite literally doing 0 damage, but it doesn’t taunt. A taunt is just a shortcut for threat, basically. A taunt will skip you to the highest position on a monster’s threat table, effectively forcing it to swap focus to you for the duration of the taunt, but afterwards you must continue generating threat so as not to lose aggro.
---
If you die on the boat the loading screen revives you
---
I mean yeah, you're right.  Is that a problem?
---
If I was going to level a healer I would go into my 60 healing build right away and just heal dungeons from 20-60
---
Pay your bill
---
Too bad you dont level with wf but rockbiter
---
Honestly given that enrage is pretty much a raid only thing, I really don't care about the dps in my group as long as it's enough that the healer doesn't oom. I for one take anyone that wants to go. Given that ferral dps, just like rogues for example, have been on the short end of the melee/spellcleave meta, I love taking them with me for groups. I actually prefer ferrals over mages nowadays, at least the ferrals won't constantly be like "gogogo", "pull more", "this isn't going fast enough" etc.
---
Viable and the only minor hindrance will be some class quests. You won't be barred from any, but there are some class quests that will require you to speak to certain people/perform certain actions that are closer to your starting zone than the location you decide to go to. If you go warlock and decide to level with your Tauren friend near TB, for example, you'll soon realize how much they hate locks there and you'll have to travel far for spells and your quests.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahababbsbabsbzbzzbxbbxbxbbdjdbxbdnssndsnzkjfndkdjdndjsnsnsnsjdbnzkxn
---
They have armoured mounts out already?
---
Most of us are still leveling and people will call out who are the ones pvping. They don't want to get hunted down just as much as us for the most part.

Discover the outside world
---
Not sure what the addon is called but I have seen this in Classic so I know it exists.
---
Pretty sure they can just send their pet out and roll their face on their keyboards and beat you to 60 without groups.
---
It’s the fact we are both stuck at the same light in the first place. The dick move made a mile back (hypothetical dick driver here, not you) had no positive impact on the drivers progress with potential stress and injury as a result. 
---
I’m not suggesting never pass someone, that’s asinine. Proceeding at a safe speed with concern for the people with whom you share the road is the goal. 
---
It is also asinine to deny that bad, selfish, aggressive drivers don’t exist. 
---
Drive for 30 min in Newark, NJ for prime examples
---
Target the tank before a pull, press F and fire!!! Usually the first one he rushes will be the first target anyways. Just make sure you don't press F after he rushes in because they will tab targets.
---
Nice. Good to know
---
Tradeskillmaster is an awesome add-on for pricing, a quick scan of the ah will give you min/max buyouts for single items and stacked items (you can do per item in stack or full stack price). Also acts as a mailer and crafting addon. Its a real piece of work and I'd recommend it to anyone. 
---
Or you could just do it the old fashioned way and look up the item on the ah yourself
---
Boss difficulty is based around an artificially high jump in miss rate etc between 62 and 63 against npcs. I've always thought this was a retarded way of doing things, but they obviously had reasons of doing it in an environment where the level capped at 60. What would happen if the max level jumped to 61 under the current system is that suddenly the end-game bosses would be trivial as dps would go up massively as they were only +2 levels.
---
If they planned this system from the start, instead of put it on afterwards, it could work really well. There would probably need to be a lower increase in boss difficulty, so a current level 63 boss might be 67 or 70 for a really hard one.
---
That way when they increase the level cap by a little bit, all the bosses get slightly easier. That way you could have raids that operated just like dungeons - do this raid from 60-63, this raid from 62-65.
---
Increase level cap by 1 every 3 months, and put out a new raid.
---
I slaughtered 5 ogres to get to it. Nope. Not on top either.
---
I am not disregarding them, I have merely heard them since vanilla. And I forgot that BGs dont give xp, is all for the freezing level comment. 
---
I have made a single twink before, and I didnt enjoy it for a length of time that gave me a sense of worth for getting the toon twinked.
---
I do like end game content, and pvp. I never truly had enough time to effectively commit to both. 
---
So I thought my comment of "I like to play casters" mixed with "I dont like twinking" implied that I like to have my complete spell set at my disposal. Sorry for not being clear enough on my opinion. And no, your post has not felt insulting in any way. I wouldn't be broken up if it did, I would just respond in kind.
---
I heard it's "the most fun" as those classes I mentioned. I dont like playing those classes (for pvp as warrior, as I will roll a tank) at low lvl pvp. And I dont spamming the exact same 3 spells in pvp. Even if it can feel that way sometimes in arena, I do like to have options.
---
I do enjoy pvp all around, my stance is I'm not going to stay at any certain lvl for it.
---
Would also like to know
---
that appears to be the hang up. thanks so much
---
Just healed scholo for the first time as spriest. It was doable, only wipes were when the tank pulled extra packs by mistake (and once when I was drinking and at 20% mana... Thanks tank!)
---
Mana was of course an issue, but just bring pots and a metric buttload of water and you're gucci.
---
This one is left to right.
---
That can probably be said of any class in the game. Not to mention mage is the most popular class in the game so it is expected that you will run into a huge variety of players.
---
What so people Craft with Essence of water thats worth so much to pay for?
---
If you don't have an epic mount at this point into the game you're likely not trying very hard or spending gold on pointless shit.
---
Lol what are you talking about. Tailoring has the most ses.of any profession by a MILE. LW has seems, but not like tailoring.
---
Having heavily played both warrior and warlock, that matchup definitely favors the warrior.  Even with the things you can do, in equal gear the warrior is probably winning that more than they lose.
---
In my experience the only ones who gank are Orc Warriors. Everyone else is rather courteous. Yes, even the rogues.
---
Those are all things the tank (druid/warr) can already take care of, sure if you're running with a pally/shammy tank you may need that stuff I suppose.
---
mages are honestly so broken
---
amazing damage, insane CC, super fuckin' short cooldowns, and good survivability w/ a reset on all that shit
---
just remember, warriors struggle to take on 2 similar lvls enemies and have 30 minute cooldowns for spells that don't really do much more than mages can do normally....
---
just note, in the time a warrior can cast a single intercept (30 sec CD) a mage gets 2 blinks (which break stuns), a shorter cd frostnova, multiple slows that make it so you can barely move, a poly for 50 sec if needed to reset the fight, and coldsnap to reset all of that... all while being able to combo you for 2,500 dmg at lvl 58 in green gear. 
---
Blizzard devs played horde (their main office in 2005 had horde flags everywhere) and several prominent devs all played casters and shamans. It's why paladins got fucked and some classes/races got way better stuff.
---
Wait.... they actually implemented level scaling in retail???
---
Good pvping. Could you share you Player/Target addon name?
---
Can you give an example? I think i understand where your coming from but i want to be sure.
---
Do quests his level that are green for you and yellow for him. The gap will start to close. you'll still end up being a couple levels higher most the time, but he will eventually catch up to a point where you are both doing yellow quests again.
---
how many warriors have beaten you and how did they do it asking for a friend.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
MARCELLO, WHAT-A U DOING-A? DAT-A IS NOT-A HOW YOU HOLD-A PEESTOL
---
The stillsuits plug your dung gun actually.
---
Tanking an armory run last night with a mage. He dropped about a quarter of the way in. I swear it went twice as smooth with just my 2 warlocks and druid than the full party
---
Sweet thanks.
---
I mean I agree with you mostly except for that it's not ignorance causing aggro pulling. Maybe the first few times you do it but if you are up to level ~30 and haven't grasped that AOEing mobs makes them untankable then you either haven't ran any dungeons or are simply not paying attention to your screen.
---
Do AOE
---
Pull aggro
---
Reflect on your own how to resolve
---
You don't need to be taught anything the game is easy enough to learn on your own
---
In Vanilla I leveled a number of classes into the 30s/40s and lost interest.  Mage was the only exception.  I leveled 2 60 mages(alliance &amp; horde) back in Vanilla and played it through TBC.
---
Brought the OG back for classic and I'm surprised how much I still absolutely love it.  I really feel like I could level a second mage to 60 already.
---
They're wrong and bad at leveling warlock then.
---
Int and spirit should be switched and your prio/weight is fine.
---
Imp Drain Soul does its job without spirit stacking lol
---
You can blame whoever you want, the fact remains that not only heartseeker will be doomed come p2, skeram will also be.
---
The solution is simple and available, get a good amount of horde to move to heartseeker. Both server will balance out in the right way.
---
Yes you will loose perfect control of BRM on the server, the classic experience will be better for everyone in the end.
---
Dam I had suppressed how OP frost mages were in pvp for so long.
---
Did anybody see Asmongold get bitch slapped by Saurfang for like 9k damage the other day? Satisfying as fuck.
---
Actually I would open with Faerie Fire and a Moonbeam, then go cat to kill mostly. The zombies were very easy, die in 30-40 seconds and I still had 40% health usually.
---
The elite black ghosts, I would go bear after pulling to intimidating shout, then cat to kill. It's a slower kill because you have to switch to their spawns for 1 attack every time.
---
The non elite 3 packs, I would FF and MB 2 of them, bear for roar, cat to kill.
---
The elite and non elite ghosts sometimes had me popping out for a war stomp and regrowth if I got bad rolls.
---
Only thing that might kill me is a pat I didn't notice, or a respawn if I wasn't careful as they agro instantly on spawn. But a couple runs and you get feel for it and it's safe.
---
I think you can fish at any of the 3 ponds and inside WC. I've also gotten them at a pretty good rate. I can get about a stack in roughly 30-45 min. The price has stagnated on Kromkrush in the last few days since everyone can get them pretty easy.
---
As a priest who mained rogue long ago, I would say roll among people who are capable of opening it, meaning rogues or anyone with keys
---
It is beautiful
---
mages require less buttons for more power and are very forgiving to play
---
theyre easy to play while being the strongest in the game
---
it is in fact the best NOOB class
---
Flippin perfect. Thank you very much.
---
agreed, that's how all my groups do it then I (priest healer) die as well as the tank.
---
ask DPS to focus their attacks and start marking a skull on the one you want them to kill first. Much easier to hold threat when DPS isn't attacking different targets. Berserker stance for everything except boss pulls would likely have you taking too much damage and not able to keep threat on anything. You healer will run out of mana fast and the whole dungeon will take longer.
---
Me and my buddies did that last week outside Astranaar in Ashenvale. Everything was calm until we started ganking people as they ran to BFD. Ended up starting a kos-fest in that region for like 6+ hours, well after we stopped. A lot of people were complaining about how hard it was just to get to BFD because both factions had players roaming around killing anyone they saw lol. One of my favorite classic wow experiences so far.
---
Others within my guild experience this also, as well with my internet and my computer it's not lag I'm 100% sure of that.
---
thank you so much im going there now to try!
---
I don't think many people sit through the opening cinematics for more than their first character.
---
yeah for dps. This is for tanks.
---
dude thankyou! imma go try now!
---
You can use it while leveling, but +defense is your best way to boost your block chance so when you start getting a lot of higher level tanking gear you'll want to drop it and put the points back into anticipation.
---
i played the same build but with a rogue! we came close to the shoulder rank but didnt get it :(
---
No. The pattern is from Dire Maul which is in phase 2.
---
So I’ve been dpsing as ret, and I have a healing set I heal in (also in ret). I’m not exactly sure why, but I’m almost always at the top of the dps charts when I dps. And if I proc my seal of command, and crit on either the white attack or the proc, I’ve never “not” pulled agro. 
---
I really don’t believe anyone when they say ret is bad dps. At least not pre-60.
---
It's great when you are specced into Enrage lol.
---
What is the normal dungeon progression for 56+? Going to clear BRD part 1 soon and wanting to know where to grind for gear next. Rogue alli if that matters.
---
Think of 8% as a soft cap. White hits account for roughly 60% of your damage. Shoot for bit closer to 12-14% with talents. Also too much crit without the sufficient hit will put you in the ‘crit cap’. There’s equations for that if you google crit cap.
---
That's where opening a trade window comes into play
---
I like how this is the same meme I posted and deleted but with shoulder pads.
---
I’ve seen people selling to only rogues and 60s for this reason.
---
Ahh... miss those days when I was learning the game in Brill and a lvl 40 mage seemed so imba! (and I didn't even know what "imba" meant...)
---
With mage AoE you're also generally killing a larger amount of enemies quicker, so I imagine it evens out in the end. Unless you're running a group of 4 mages at which point it's undoubtedly quicker when they all AoE even with everyone drinking between pulls.
---
Have always been an excellent Warrior tank myself. So far only the Druid is scratching my itch. I still get to tank, but I don't have to commit to it at all times.
---
Oh I do, I live in nyc but tbh I like when someone drives fast, maybe more dangerously, rather than slow. It clears up the traffic.  
---
EWR is a nightmare to get to even with low traffic because people are actually insane, it’s almost like they don’t want to get to their destination. 
---
But in newark downtown yeah youre right you’re not going anywhere if you’re cutting people off so there’s no point in it. There’s ALWAYS 50 cars in front of you. My example was for maybe 3 cars in front and you just try to break away
---
I've grouped with both great and terrible mages, just like every other class. Though I can see why a tank would be wary of grouping with a mage after dealing with a few bad apples.
---
 No mentions for reserved in the LFM, i wasted 20+ min when getting group together after that he mentions what you can see in the screenshot!   
---
Not cool man! Not Cool!
---
25 deep to find the right comment
---
This is why I still love star wars galaxies to this day
---
I do pay my boss for the opportunity to work. Most of us do. The currency is in hours and labour. 
---
I'm just making a joke about how it could just be a copy pasta for when people ask about why they don't ban bots.
---
In a party mages usually don't, but some mages offer mage services in a city for hire (port, food, water).
---
Too true. As a kid I imagined myself talking on a cell phone all the time. Now of my Cell phone rings it's either a scammer, spammer, or bad news.
---
I have a macro for my autoshot ability and i walk with esdf and mapped the keys arround it.. like in this picture: http://raydenuni.com/wow/KeyboardLayout/keyboard-esdf.jpg
---
As i am only lvl 29 and it's a "different" client I don't have set up all the bindings.
---
I play with this style since cata and it works fine for me.
---
Paladin tanking is superfun (but I guess I did that when they got a taunt), however leveling a paladin is pretty darn boring. Healing is similar but also kinda fun. Priest don't get the tanking but have a pretty sweet solo-leveling experience
---
I have always wondered why they didnt just take the same approach they do for cinematics when they were looking to make the WoW movie. It would of been expensive as all hell to render, but I think it would of been much more effective than what they ended up with.
---
I can hear the arcane explosion sound in my head after you typed that, and for some reason it's always followed by the sound of a male gnome dying. "EH ehhh."
---
I use WF because I'm usually grinding mobs 3 or 4 levels above me.  If i'm fighting green mobs, I might use biter, but the extra damage from wf is necessary to take down harder targets.
---
I mean he is a mage in classic..... with that name..... did you expect something better? If so, shame on you.
---
Depends on what kind of water.  If you have a level X0 mage it's going to take them a long fucking time to make 40 water since they make 2 at a time and have to stop to drink after making 8 or so.
---
I've always kept my stances on shift+1,2,3.  It works fairly well for me.  Universal buttons used in all 3 stances go on my top action bars and buttons only pertaining to a single stance go in the main action bar.  Luckily warriors in vanilla don't have quite as much button madness as retail.  So my pull is effectively just 1 (charge+rend macro) -&gt; ~ (TC in Battle Stance) -&gt; shift + 2 -&gt; shift + middle mouse (demo) -&gt; 3 (sunder in defensive) -&gt; back mouse button (taunt in defensive)
---
Obviously how you want to map your keys will be on a per-player basis.  But even without using a Naga mouse I survive.
---
This thread is about warriors in a fantasy video game. Running around hitting everyone and everything is to be expected.
---
because 2h arms tanks are far, FAR weaker than mages, and bear swipe is amazing but still....
---
mages do way too much dmg, have way too much control, and are way too easy to play w/ such short cooldowns
---
only **scrub teams** even take tanks. The way you do it is 4 mages and 1 healer.
---
Yea overall it is a bit slow. But it's not that bad, and I find myself playing more efficiently in the instance because it's just kill, regen, repeat... no running around for quests or ganking &gt;_&gt;
---
Also the money is pretty decent at 5-7g per hour.
---
I haven't read any pre-WoW books (the Warcraft books) so I can't speak about those, but I've read a few of the *World* of Warcraft-related books. In their own right they aren't exceptional and not very well written, but for someone obsessed with WoW and wanting to delve deeper into the story, they can be fun and interesting. But if you are a regular reader of fantasy novels you will definitely notice the mediocre/cheesy quality of writing. I would recommend them to superfans of WoW though!
---
Mage has remove curse for that. The worst thing is long fear.
---
I just got Force of Will from Emperor last night, and I am just wondering, should I equip it over Mark of the Chosen, or Rune of the Guard Captain? +7 defense seems great, even though 25 less damage taken doesn’t rock my world.
---
...but why male models?
---
I would gild this post if I had any golds to give. This will have to suffice. Here you go: 🌟
---
I have to admit, the invasion of retail people has definitely altered the feel of dungeons in general. They're still treating it like BFA where you don't mark anything you just run in and start hitting things. Pure chaos as a Healer it sucks, no one is tanking because everyone is tanking. Most of the time it seems like the Warriors are either using a two-hander or dual wielding to tank and I'm like huh?
---
Yeah it's beginning to look more and more that way, but I don't want to end up on some shitlist either unfortunately. It sucks because in this particular group everyone was happy for me and went out of their way to help me get this item except the one ninja.
---
I played Mage and Rogue on retail, decided to roll a Hunter for Classic, mostly because of the challenge. So far, so good, I really **LOVE** my character. Here's a list of pros and cons.
---
**PROS :**
---
* **Easy to level** \- It has been said over and over again, Hunters is the best class to level up. Chaining mobs with very low downtime and you can easily complete quests that are orange (or even red sometimes). It is very possible to pull more than one mob at a time, which cannot be said for every classes.
---
* **Aspect of the Cheetah** \- At level 20, you become so fast you will make everybody jealous. It's only when this aspect is active and you run beside another class that you understand it's real value. And it works in Dungeons too ! One of my favorite spell by far !
---
* **Pet management** \- This offer it's own set of challenges. Of course, you can go with the easy wat and leave every abilities on auto-cast, but I prefer to manually cast them (Dash, Prowl and even Claw). I feel like the more control I got, the higher my damage got. Also, I started running dungeons to get my pre-raid BiS and managing the pet offers a fun game mechanic. It's something else to do during the pulls and can be quite tricky at times.
---
* **Easy to play, Hard to master** \- The rotation and the dead zone are two important aspects of the class that makes it very unique. It is not easy to manage, especially in dungeons. It certainly feels more engaging and the more I play, the better I become and the higher my DPS gets. Especially in dungeons where *mobs run away in fear*.
---
* **Weapon progression is easy and fun** \- Throughout your questing, you should choose between Guns and Arrows and then look up for a weapon progression guide. The one I found (I used bows exclusively) was tightly coupled with the leveling route I had in mind and it felt like a breeze.
---
* **You can/should get your mount at lvl 40** \- Try and get Skinning very early during your adventure. Up until you get Thick Leather, you can vendor all the mats to earn extra money. Also, look up at your damage rotation and train only these spells, avoid training everything else (with a few QoL exceptions such has Track Humanoids). Since you're most likely not going to spend a single penny in the AH toward gear (the only piece that matters is your Ranged Weapon and you can obtain most of these while questing), you will have enough gold at 40 to buy my mount straight up. **I did not have to farm anything,** all I did was questing. *This might be true for every Skinner ...*
---
**CONS :**
---
* **Ammunition** \- On top of taking a lot of space in your bags, you'll have to be very careful with your ammunitions. It is very sad to start a pull and to run out of arrows, since your melee damage will be nowhere near your ranged damage.
---
* **Ganked easily** \- During my leveling days, I tried to keep my downtime as low as possible. With good mechanics and a proper rotation, you can kill mobs even if you and your pet are both at 25% HP (ping-pong the aggro and kitting). I almost never take time to eat and drink, since I carry a Spirit set and rely heavily on Mend Pet. This made me a very easy prey for a lot of Hordes who took advantage of that. When they engage on you during a fight, you don't have many tools to get away.
---
* ***Every loot is a Hunter loot*** \- At level 60, but also during low level dungeons, you will receive a lot of hatred when you press "Need" on a piece of gear. I've received my share of flames when I rolled need on the Blackstone Ring in Maraudon. I even got kicked out of a few runs for it, but I went for the upgrade anyway.
---
* **Finding groups can be hard** \- PUGs for Dungeons was complicated for me. I decided to focus on questing until level 40 and I had a lot of difficulties trying to find runs for ZF, Uldaman and other dungeons. With spellcleave and AoE runs, people will almost always invite a Mage or a Rogue before you.
---
* **Unpopular in many raiding compositions** \- Finding a spot in a raid will be complicated. It is not as much right now, because people will invite almost anyone who is 58+, but these days will come to an end very soon. I've read my share of guides about Vanilla raiding and I think most compositions will bring at most 3 hunters. If you can find a guild willing to bring you in their roster through all the phases, you should stick with them.
---
Overall, I would grade my appreciation at **9/10**. If I could, I would do the same choice again and again. Solid class choice, you should definitely  *join the Hunt* !
---
I think that's it for now ! Feel free to ask any questions, I will try my best to answer them.
---
I joined a new casual guild just to get some of that old experience from back when MC clears took 8+ hours.
---
IT COST 400 GOLD?!?!?!?!?
---
The /who will balance out later I think. Mages just level so insanely fast compared to other classes
---
Expected full run UBRS with fair rolls :D
---
Don't tell me where to fish, ally scum. Back to westfall with you
---
There are a few reasons that make warriors the tank for Raids.
---
* AOE taunt. Warriors have it. Nobody else.
---
* Avoiding crushing blows. Druids cannot get their Defense skill high enough to push Crushing blows off the table. Pallies and Warriors can.
---
* Regular taunt. Warriors have this, while Pallies do not.
---
In short, Warriors and Pallies, with shields can avoid crushing blows, which druids cannot. And Warriors can taunt which pallies cannot. So Warriors have the most complete toolkit for tanking.
---
You need to bring him in boss loot range
---
I'm 38 orc warrior. Do WW quest or go for SM Armory Ravager drop?
---
Shite hunter using a turtle on a pvp server and can’t find his fd button to make you drop combat on that first cast
---
I noticed this a couple weeks ago when leveling through the Flats and was sorely disappointed. Has anyone filed a legit bug report on this? I'd love to see it fixed.
---
Rerolled to mage from rogue because they are definately way more OP with less counters and not cooldown reliant. Prove me wrong!
---
YES. THANK YOU. retail babies and human priests coming to classic acting like we can all just get along
---
Well...I mean...a mage should be able to roflstomp a warrior. The classes fulfill different roles. Tanks are not the counter to a mage. Rogues and hunters (and other mages) are the mage counters.
---
All that said, I'm 100% for class tweaks and additions, so long as the classes remain very distinct and don't turn into the bland, samey classes that they eventually become in retail.
---
I have been looking at macros and addons for some time, but I don't get how there isn't an official documentation page for the API. Your best shot is to look at fan made wikis or existing addons. But where did *they* get their information from?
---
"I hope he's going to a happy place"
---
That seems an horrible way to level tbh lol
---
Wait.. was this before or after you killed any bosses
---
It's hard with all the different style tanks one group will have me polying everything the next group I'm getting yelled at if I'm not aoe'ing everything.
---
Kind of comes down to each tank and how they want to play I usually let them decide since they're the one making the pulls. Unless you have a hunter in the group we all know how that goes
---
Those Hordelings were defending themselves against alliance aggression.  It was only a matter of time before you ganked them anyways.
---
You got it right sir.
---
I'm thinking about switching up to something sort of like this. I'm only level 45 though, would you go through the ret section first and then to consecrate? My friends tell me it doesn't do enough damage to be worth it but the ground is just so shiny!
---
It doesn't, but playing a warlock trains your brain to lifetap every time you're at full health to not waste regen time. I literally anxious when I'm at full health, I HAVE to lifetap.
---
As a healer, i dont heal warlocks at half health unless they are taking damage
---
It Litterally sais: "Rogue" on his class... Why would you trust him?
---
Same. Yesterday I stayed home from work and spent all day getting fishing and cooking from 0-300. It was a lot of grinding but was fun and well worth it. I’m lvl 35 too.
---
ATM Machine
---
2h tanking for the first 40ish levels, for sure, through SM. Ulda is where you start needing the shield, but for non-elite packs even in ST, a weapon swap and a whirlwind is better than twiddling my fingers, rage-starved with no aggro.
---
It might also help in case of an emergency...at least the person making the call knows she's his wife.
---
Mages for instance have always shit on rogues and warriors, and probably still will with leeway. Some people say it was in Vanilla, some people say it was added after wrath, idk. I wasn't playing seriously back then so can't remember. But ultimately, it may make it easier to deal with caster, but it won't change the status quo much. A good mage will still destroy rogues and warriors. It's only when trinkets and stun/slow removal come into play that they have even a chance.
---
I was telling my Pally friend that I really enjoy the ability that lets me pull mana from his mana pool.
---
Ofc. Didn't have trouble with this mob at 49, maybe a couple levels lower would pull it. The mob isn't really that close, as you can see the nameplate isn't even visible because he's not in the \~20 yard range or w/e it is. :D
---
Up scaling also worked very well in gw2, even netting lower players stat advantages under certain circumstances. Man I miss gw2, I wish they hadnt completely shit the bed with that game.
---
Got your back bro
---
I'm pretty sure there's a lot more to life than being really, really, ridiculously thicc looking. And I plan on finding out what that is.
---
The very nature of ninjapulling makes you the asshole by default. If you're in a situation you don't like then just leave.
---
Also for example,
---
Compare the dreamweave head vs the shadoweave one.
---
Shadoweave is +24 shadow dmg and 10 int
---
Dreamweave is +21 all spell and 10 int and 14 spirit.
---
Essentially by switching to dreamweave you lose 3 shadow spell damage but gain 14 spirit, and 21 all other school damage (mainly fire for immolate, also good for rain of fire aoe for dungeons).
---
Dreamweave is more expensive but you use it for like 15 levels so its 100% worth it.
---
Is there a non-TSM add-on to add information to crafting tooltips? I use Auctionator and I love its simple tooltips for items: it simply adds the vendor + last seen AH price. However, this doesn't work in the crafting menu for ingredients or the product. I'd love to have the vendor/AH prices on tooltips in the crafting menu too.
---
The bravery when you realise there is no PvP trinket
---
What addon is used for kill on sight?
---
ah ok thanks!
---
What if I have two accounts. One alliance one horde and trade goods between them?
---
It doesn't matter. We can trade globals all day long applying and removing curse of tongues while dots keep on ticking away, don't even need fear most of the time.
---
I salv mages instead of wisdom
---
The issue with bear tanks is surviveability.  If you find healers that are willing to deal with it that's fine, a lot seem to prefer warrior tanks though.
---
I mean, it's not that hard? Retail is obviously very bad right now, but there are a lot of things about retail that are better than things about classic (classic is obviously better on the whole). Raid difficulty is better in retail, access to raid loot (read: raid loot, not all loot) is better in classic, specifically having only 2-3 items drop per boss for 40 people is not great design. Class balance disparity is a lot better in retail than classic, where some specs are just flat out bad. 
---
Yeah, you'll never get a game that's exactly like classic if they build upon classic, but it's definitely possible to build something that polishes up some of classic's rougher edges with the lessons they should have learned, without going fully into the problems retail has. 
---
Do I have faith in blizzard to actually do this? Probably not. But as a concept, it shouldn't be that hard to bring class balance in line, make raids more difficult, raid loot less frustrating, and maintain the viability of raid items across tiers, maintain the major RPG elements of reputation, professions, and talent trees being important and varied, and the more vibrant and dynamic world than what we currently have. 
---
Again, don't think Blizzard will do it properly, but I don't think it's really that hard conceptually.
---
Talents mean very little pre 60 in my opinion. Its your gear and class that matters. As a priest you can heal with any spec up until raids, but even in raids you could probably heal them with only some problems. Priest is the strongest healing class, its similar to how no warriors level as prot yet they hold aggro fine in dungeons.
---
Even looking at your talents, things like 5% crit might seem really really good, but it pales in comparison to your gear.
---
I'd day about 20% of encounters result in a fight, so definitely possible to quest, as always grouping with others is a great way to deter gankers in addition to questing faster and also meeting friends.
---
Aw man... you are missing out! Power crouch is life. Not to mention when you /laugh your Troll literally points and grabs their belly in laughter. It's true Troll fashion. 
---
Plus... "I kill 2 dwarves in the morning, I kill 2 dwarves at night" - removed recently but the best /silly in the entire World (or Warcraft).
---
This must be recorded on the new iPhone 10 camera
---
So Gouge/Sinister Strike/etc. are abilities, not talents. Only things in the talent trees are talents. Sinister Strike to build then Eviscerate to spend is about what you'll be doing while leveling. Gouge is mostly useful as a defensive ability, not a damaging one. It gives you some time to apply part of a bandage, though Blind gives you more time for that.
---
As for your talents, if you do feel like you really messed them up you can reset them by visiting a rogue trainer. The first respec is 1 gold.
---
Nope two golds and at the top. Posted 6 hours ago too so I think it's already past the low effort tag.
---
He would be useless he has to fight mobs 6 lvl higher than him (unless he can heal you) So if you want to play with him you have to do stuff within his lvl
---
The problem with remove curse is that if I'm spamming tongues and you're spamming remove curse, I am winning, cause my dots are eating you alive and you're doing no damage to me.
---
I'd rather group with mature, pleasant players than "good" players any day. If I need to fill a spot for a dungeon, I'll pick the slightly under-leveled person who seems normal over the higher level rogue "Sixtyninelol".
---
Player was probably trying to delete it.
---
I hide in the gurubashi arena every night. Let's just say that I would've been discovered by those skull leveled players way more often without thus talent.
---
But, that is the talent for coldblood/hemo/eviscerate build, if you wanna go specifically for ambush/backstab build, then you HAVE to take Opportunity talent
---
When you say entrance do you mean where you drop in with portal or entrance of Mara? Cause ain’t no way the entrance would be doable, maybe where you drop in with portal but I would think you’d have to be a bit closer.
---
Nice man gz!
---
People need to get over themselves and stop acting like no one else can roll on things they both want just because they are a less optimal spec or class. 
---
                 
---
I see it in this game and all over this sub. If you don't want to roll against classes for things that are also on their BiS list just because your BiS list will produce better DPS eventually don't bring them. Unless you are in a guild with them the greater good of DPS doesn't mean shit.
---
Lots of UI addons can change fonts. I use ElvUI, but I assume you can find one to suit your style. Can also try replacing the .ttf or .rtf files in your WoW folder if its there.
---
To be more specific, this was about 2-3 weeks ago, and it was limited to equippable items (weapons/armor).  I was searching the auction house for low level items to disenchant, and the leatrixplus vendor prices in the tooltip were exactly double the actual vendor price (I bought some thinking I could sell to the vendor for a profit and was sadly incorrect).  So it wasn't even a stackable item or even in my inventory.  Not sure what was up with it, and it very well may be fixed by now, but I like that BVP shows you the vendor price for a single, for a full stack (and the quantity), and the price for what you have in inventory.
---
I have atlasloot, ElvUI, AdiBags and ItemRack in my list of addons, and whenever I am on the character screen, hovering over a gear slot, a flyout opens showing other items in my bags for that slot, so I’d say it’s gotta be at least one of those addons causing it.
---
Bears have an AoE taunt too

I'm a druid tank, formed a group for UBRS and a Warrior whispered to off-tank, another warrior later joined the group and asked if he could roll on tank gear, i left it up to the warrior tank to decide and said i'd respect his decision, the warrior tank was kind enough to say any tank gear was fair game except for Draconian Deflector, reach the final boss, Draconian Deflector drops and the other shithead warrior rolled need on it, he thankfully lost the roll
---
Biggest douchebag move i've personally seen in Classic so far
---
Hey! Lvl 46 Lock atm! 
---
When doing SM I would say it’s about 70% of the mages damage using rain of fore and 90%, if not matching, using hellfire 
---
As someone else mentioned, your main barrier is very low mobility aoe vs their AoE! 
---
So what can you do? Plan smart, but distance between u before launching, Hellfire has a much larger radius than you would initially  think form the animation! 
---
Take moments to pause, just stop for like 2- 3 seconds, maybe drain life or life tap and you make sure you don’t pull, allowing you to keep the dps up
---
REALLY IMPORTANT! It’s everyone’s instinct to run when they pull... you’re pissing away dps, they run faster! The best option is to run towards your mages or tank and let them freeze them or take the aggro 
---
Finally, you mention not finding a group, consider that it’s always quieter during the week, it’s possible less are on! Also note that the ‘pack’ is a higher lvl than SM now and the people behind the levelling ‘pack’ on balance are more against the spell cleave, so people see you looking for it and just ignore it 
---
I’d recommend subtly trying to find a spell cleave rather than LFG it 
---
Good luck!
---
Phase 3
---
I believe it is.  Looks like the Verdantis River to me.  They were probably both doing the Nat Pagle quest and trying to catch the Feralas Ahi.  That damned fish took me about 100 casts to catch ^^^RNGesus ^^^hates ^^^me
---
thank you i love you so much
---
Our GM/MT just got the carapace after 126 rend runs.
---
Exactly, just leave bro
---
Yeah I’m not debating if Warrior wasn’t the best. Just that there is a lot of content out there (particularly YouTube) that is really misleading.
---
I mean, it should be both, right? Changing your skins, as you put it, feels bad. But it also feels bad that every new tier invalidates the last tier. It feels better in classic that items from MC remain largely relevant until late-stage AQ40. That's not that hard to implement, they just need each new tier to add variability and small stat upgrades, instead of just flat-out upgrades.
---
"the bad parts aren't as bad as you remember"
---
Someone hasn't been to darkshore yet
---
There are addons for that, but it just change text font
---
Is that accounting for the cost of the potions?
---
That’s pretty harsh.
---
I never said the mage counters the lock. In fact yes, the lock is very strong against the mage and will win most of the time. That is why the mage probably chose to kill him first. I said that the mage counters the warrior.  Sorry for the confusion but I never said that.
---
Dailies were a chore I would stress about. I'm Classic there's a million things I want to do and will do, I just get so side tracked doing God knows what - and I'm having so much fun doing it.
---
Oh I'm playing on a PvE server so it has been nice and relaxing like real fishing lol
---
Good points across the board, however I have one question:
---
Resource gain threat is calculated on a 1-0.5 ratio meaning a +71 mana gain from SoW should generate 35.5 threat, and this threat I assume is generated for every single mob that you're currently in their threat list.
---
My question is, how exactly is this threat boosted with RF? As it's not holy damage.
---
That's funny af.  Also, TIL.
---
Than it would be end game bis i think
---
As a new player; what in the fuck is this?
---
what the fuck did i just read
---
I agree with this completely.
---
Nah, right there with ya. A lot of groups I've been in communicate how they want to pull mobs and mark which ones to sheep, which is a priority, and the secondary targets in a mob. The ones that don't have been a complete shit show lol
---
I have a US account and I live in Europe. Have been playing for years and never had any problems besides the occasional lag
---
I mean it takes my maybe 15-20 seconds to kill something higher than me this way, and i get to do quests that give me 5k instead of 2.8k or w/e so it works out just fine. I did an entire lvl 50 quest at lvl 44 yesterday.
---
We’ve gone a full cycle

---
Because he decried all us other fussy healers as "bad". Yes, the rest of us who don't always have a mage in the group to hand out conjured water, and are simply wanting to make the most value out of our Moonberry juice. Because nothing ever goes bad in his runs. It just never happens, where dungeons are so easy and such a breeze that Mr. High and Mighty player that he is, doesn't have time for scrubs like us.
---
He doesn't care that Moonberry juice doesn't come cheap and adds up fast when we're sitting and drinking barely recovering 400 mana and oh look the tank's already run off, charged headlong into the next pack and is taking damage.
---
The worst part of all, is that this is a fellow healer. To that he deserves to heal the next ten groups with a 2h tank who sits in beserker stance the whole time and simply uses damage abilities, with dps who simply attack whatever they feel like.
---
Definitely use it over mark, %hit is still needed as tank
---
Speaking as a WoW refugee who bailed right before Cataclysm, found and enjoyed ESO, but am entirely focused on WoW Classic now, this is true.

Yeah all my friends rolled on a pvp server and followed suite but I don't like it. My only pvp encounters are un Fair ganks. Like you I like pvp to be fair and to be able to turn it off and on when I like

Haha that will do it.

Well bis is bis for a reason

Looool what? It's ALWAYS better to single target? Not true at all.
---
Did they? I didn't pay much attention to it apart from monkeynews/tribe and a couple other streams
---
If you can play competently in Classic you’ll have np in retail. Retail is much easier but more systems/mechanics and classes of course. Might as well give it a shot if you’re curious, can get out of the starter zone in one evening.
---
This post is a fancy way to describe salt.

Pretty much this.  Tanks are always in demand.  They'll either learn to play nicely with good tanks or, well, they won't have many choices lol.

There was almost as much as now but, not mega sites like now. Had to know a bunch of sites to get around and most sites were still sub based. So you would only get free clips mostly.

(But yeah I tap and eat/drink a helluva lot :D)

To be fair, every warrior I encounter in Ungoro drinks free actions potions like I drink water

AoE by itself isn't bad, it's just that most mages with AoE too early before the tank can build aggro and then things get messy.

Both are cheating. One just makes blizzard money.

PreBiS means pre-raid BiS. You are leveling, not at 60 gathering pre-raid gear. I would aim for the axe off Eranikus next, it’s a few levels away from you, but hit is very important. PreBiS IMO is Annihilator for the additional armor reduction, but it is a very expensive crafted item.

Alright, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this because its commonly accepted knowledge that locks are a hard counter to mages. A mage isn't going to come close to killing a lock with fireblast or coc, unless the lock is green or grey to you. I guess I'll leave it with this, there's a lot of different ways to counter a mage as a lock. All things being equal, its just not a fair match-up.
---
Think questing with a guide unless (unless you can quest fast without one). But the issue on my server is that it can often become very crowded still. Dungeons are at least guaranteed xp...
---
If you're using dark pact the succubus with everything autocast off is supposed to be a very good Mana battery while drain tanking.
---
There is no honor code when it comes to the opposite faction.
---
Assuming it's fake cause it's not a full screenshot
---
He attained the moral victory there by killing your friend one time. Purchasing that sweet sweet kill with gallons of blood.
---
Anyone here in a guild that clears MC? What kind of loot system do you use? We're currently torn between just rolling everything off or using DKP, the more i read about DKP the more annoying it seems. Are there any successfull guilds that just /roll gear off and don't use DKP? Me and other officers cant decide
---
Quests from red to green give the same xp..
---
Mages are the new huntards
---
The question is whether my assessment is accurate. I think they don't seem worthwhile, but since they're recommended so much perhaps someone with more insight could explain if I'm missing something here
---
Considering a re-roll. Level 47 warrior with emphasis on tanking but due to irl situations it’s becoming extremely daunting to continue. I do not enjoy dps in pve at all so if I can’t tank idk what to do with no BGs. Considering a resto shaman or Druid.
---
In dungeons you can mark multiple mobs with these icons. In vanilla, WoW, where you just couldn't pull an entire pack and burn them down in 30 seconds, you had to use these icons to tell the group/raid which mob to kill first, which to kill second, which to polymorph, etc.
---
This is a mage's interpretation of the icons, i.e., just blizzard everything.
---
There are a bunch of funny ones in this sub. Scroll down and enjoy. The rogue one made me chucklel.
---
ugh. I would camp the shit out of you
---
working together feels better than any gank imo
---
This is what I do on my lock, ask the priest first if he needs the spirit heavy gear
---
I'm a warrior with blacksmithing, the better version of a rogue.
---
Catchin' that Nightfin, I see.
---
In dungeon parties, it's expected that we will all use our individual advantages for the good of the party. A warlock will provide summons, a mage will provide tables, etc.
---
Even services that are normally provided for a fee (portals or lockpocking) are done freely for the party, because we recognize that we are not acting as individuals at this particular time, but leveraging our strengths as a group to accomplish what we can't do alone.
---
This needs to be done carefully, with gates.  I.E.  You can have X, but you can't have X AND Y together because of: reason.  You can go back and get Y, but it will replace X.
---
If something like this isn't implemented, you have the "alternate advancement" problem of EQ where your capacity for end-game became hampered by the requirement to grind out another 40 levels in order to be "optimal".
---
Succubus and you turn off her lash of pain once you get dark pact so she's a mana-battery. 
---
It can vary, though. Sometimes the other pets abilities are handier to have out like lots of caster-mobs and the felhunter for a spell-lock and dispel or whatnot.
---
Or maybe you're in a dungeon with aoe damage that's killing your pet, a phased imp is better then.
---
Nope, Fairbanks!
---
Thanks! I wasn't aware of this
---
The journey is leveling. Just play and do whatever looks fun to you there’s no rush.
---
Still, blacklist them.  You should roll need on things that are an upgrade for the role you are playing at that time.  Not off-spec, unless no-one else needs it for their main spec.
---
So can we not normalize multi-boxing on this subreddit? Thanks.
---
If the opposite faction does /wave to me I will respond with /no then kill them cause you know fuck em
---
Hitting 41
---
What even the benefit of this? Why does it matter?
---
Dude you should have cannibalized at the end. Eat dat azz.
---
Warlock lvl 44 - Drain Tanking.  What stats should I be prioritizing for my equipment?
---
I think Dive's guide says to aim for stamina since I'm tanking - but what about spell power? Should I aim for shadowweaver set?
---
Let them die.
---
I cant find any on my server. I check everyday in the hopes someone will put it up for cheap.
---
Well, I think you should focus on getting gold so you can buy all the endgame stuff.   If you plan on using your profession to attain that goal, then yes, level your professions.
---
That! And I would like an option to right click the icon on the taskbar and click wow classic.
---
Even if my game is set to classic there is no icon for it by right clicking it always goes to retail
---
Thanks for the reply, I must have quit playing before this was introduced.
---
I understand how it works. I'm saying that people who reserve items are not trustworthy. What's stopping them from telling you right before Herod that the legs are also reserved (just like in the OP)?
---
Blizzard is so mana inefficient if it's not at least a pack of 3
---
Now I've seen pictures of people holding swords like guns and people holding guns like swords. Someone should tell the weapons trainers in Azeroth to step up their game.
---
Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
---
I'll get right on it.
---
Just have fun, tbh. I recommend getting first aid for sure though, if you don't have it already. My plan at 40 is to spam ZF for a long ass time because that's an amazing dungeon. So find an aspect of progression that you find enjoyable and do that.
---
Most likely abusing layering. Very common thing on basically every server.
---
His name is Blutosmash "Robert the hammer Shapiro" Paulson.
---
If you were to add transmog to Classic BUT let players flip a switch that turns it off, so that they can see what other players are actually wearing instead of the transmog, that would be FINE. Item identity would be somewhat diminished, but only if you choose to diminish it for yourself. If you don't want that, don't use it. The problem with Tmog in retail is that I don't have a choice in the matter, even if I don't use tmog, I still need to look at Billy McFuckwits ugly all-black mog or someone using a spoon as a mace or something when tanking a raid boss.
---
I only care about being able to make my own character not look like a reject from the YMCA, I don't mind if other people see the clown-gear underneath.
---
Frankly anyone who disagrees with this is a silly person. It's just like with the modern graphics settings in Classic. Don't like it? Think there's too much grass? Think the water looks too modern? Turn it off!
---
Personally for me I went on some adventures.  I looked up what zones are around my level.  Traveled there and quested in the zones.  Learned my mystical arts of Enchanting my increasing my level beyond artisan along with becoming a weaver of Tailoring.
---
I hate commenting like this normally. But. ^^^^ This
---
We should have dual spec but you should only be able to switch at your class trainer.
---
Virtually identical to mine except I drop the 2 points from Savage Fury to get Thick Hide to 5/5.  There's really no way to get both and stay under 30 unless you ditch Feral Charge and FFF.
---
I agree that ESO's monetisation is crappy, but how is eso pay to win? Unless you count mount training books, everything else is cosmetic or convenience.
---
At level 50-60 it’s a pretty common thing, as it was in OG vanilla. 
---
A lot of people will be farming a dungeon for a specific item. A big one in vanilla was skinning the beast. People would make sure that they were the only skinner in the group and would have a guarantee that they could skin the beast before they came to the run. 
---
Some bosses have very powerful items with a low drop rate. If that’s all people need from the dungeon, they’re very unlikely to join or run a group where that chance is cut in half or 1/3 by having to roll against others.
---
Use wowhead classic, it’ll tell you the phase on the right side of the page
---
Here's another one, why the heck does alliance have all the good aoe leveling locations up to level 31 ish? So annoying!
---
Because she has a quest that enables you to summon the bat boss.
---
Prebis?
---
More like BIS until Aq 40...
---
The thing is though, we know what ripple effects certain changes have. So when those certain changes get proposed again there is massive pushback because they know what will happen.
---
Doing God's work.
---
Nowhere is one word.
---
That's a silly way to look at it. They shouldn't make minor improvements unless they're going to go full tilt on an entirely seperate game?
---
Pagle
---
On release Skeram was like 56/44. Which is as good of a split as you can ask for on a PvP server.
---
Then the top Alliance guilds got spanked in the first couple weeks and transferred off somewhere easier.
---
And much like rats, once the first ones start abandoning ship the rest follow.
---
I'd love to have a 5 to 1 enemy ratio in STV, sounds challenging and entertaining.

&gt;Level 35 Pally looking for mature guild with plans to raid on an East Coast time schedule.   Lots of retail experience as well as private servers.    Have been an officer as well as class leader in the past.   Plan to go Holy at 60 (obv).   Basically looking for a cool group of mature folks to enjoy the game with.
---
Health doesn't actually increase the amount of healing you intake from drains, only spell power does. It both increases the damage dealt and amount healed so it's much faster and efficient overall.
---
Thanks Bill Cosby for ruining our classic experience...smh
---
wow-petopia for all your pet needs
---
It also makes druids ludicrously OP, so I wouldn't complain.
---
They shouldn't have been standing there
---
Ah. I was a tank in vanilla. Didn't have to reserve anything because I got it.
---
Sounds like a failure to communicate tbh. If he didn't see your bar or is confusing yours with a mage's you need to let him know otherwise bad stuff will happen
---
Yeah, I understand the talents.  MS is worth it at 40 even without the crit chance.
---
Dodge and parry are not effected by chance to hit
---
If its 1v1 just poly them and wait it out, or stall with ice blocks
---
Wow. You are over-estimating my ability
---
I could possibly do 1 push up...maybe. Sit-ups...probably. Squats, yeah...planks, well I'd start at like 10seconds
---
It's just push-ups that I have tried before but fail at 
---
a lot
---
thank you though! I will definitely keep it in min d
---
Its good for levelling. But with the sheer volume of Warriors out there means that there's really low demand for Druid tanks.
---
A guild will probably just take a Warrior tank to make everyone's lives easier. Especially the healers.
---
They're good for PvP though. It's mostly Boomkin and Feral damage that's super low comparitive to other DPS classes.
---
As a Orc rogue I found hunters and pallys have been the bigger dicks to me. 
---
Could be their hatred for rogues
---
Sure, but pretty much any dungeon (and even some raids) can be tanked without a shield.
---
Yeah, fuck Gnomes.
---
It can be resisted it also was really really really buggy throughout Vanilla.

Herod represent!!
---
We support strong world PvP, but respect not ganking someone fishing.
---
Warriors can only push crushing blows off the table with shield block which blocks a single attack every 5 seconds.  Unless the mob only attacks once every 5 seconds they are still vulnerable to crushing blows.
---
I’m doing all the above and expect to hear back from me with stories of my journeys!!!

locks hardcounter mages and this guys talking about trading globals. 15 years later.

The recipe is hard to come by.  I’ve seen 2 so far.  One bought by an in-game friend for 75g and the other listed on the AH for 180g.

My favorite piece of clothing.  I didn't get Prophecy or Transcendance until the rest of my guildies essentially got them.  I love this robe and the way it looks on me.

&gt;Thank you for completely not reading my post.

They've said nothing to warrant this dickish response.

It’s really this easy
---
I’m a mage because I’ve been a mage since vanilla. DPS numbers are always my priority. #imthatmage
---
Use a succubus all the time, hits harder than the blueberry and if you get ganked you got that charm. Unexpected mob comes up, charm.
---
For gluth? Magmadar is easy, so still don't need more than 2 in a 40 man raid
---
Just to run around honestly. I would have to get 5 full ticks of 500 to die. It's kind of fun to gamble while questing. I should note I'm a troll hunters so my hp doesn't need to be full.

Dont you take away my 12 year old coming of age celebratory carton of cigs away! How else am I gonna get that awesome raspy old Texan voice?!?!?

As someone who knows people with dwarfism, y'all need to stop comparing healthy gnome and dwarf bodies to those very real and slightly unhealthy bodies. It's not apples to apples.

Wat
---
But with my plan to play being just to level and dungeon with friends, is feral enjoyable and bear good enough to tank should my warrior friend want to go dps at any point?
---
Like blackface. Got it.
---
If you enjoy every single spell you cast getting resisted, then be my guest and play fire in MC and BWL.
---
Yes yes let the hate flow through you.
---
That is common on pvp servers too, especially if you're both trying to get something done.  If I could attack my own faction though I would.  Takes like 2x to finish any guarded node quest because there's always some same faction ass ready to steal it and I can't interrupt them.
---
My hatred for this entire zone knows no bounds, but this is a lovely photo.
---
WvW overall became a total after thought. I thought it was bad when they scrapped EotM and the new zones they created for PoF, but then they added the wvw mount to the game... Pvp is still fun, but a total mess; anyone who was worth playing against has quit, and balance has taken to dramatic reworks every patch it seems. I think the leaderboards last i checked had like a total of 200 people. Raids completely killed dungeons, and are pretty close to killing whats left of fractals. Without dungeons, the primary story telling method has fallen solely onto the shitastic living story instances they have been introducing. The devs opted for a storyboard style approach instead of actual freaking content, so we get to play a life is strange tier adventure every few months for like 2 hours and that is all we get outside of grinding zones. Mounts killed any reason for anyone to really traverse the zones and see them up close and personal, and all the new maps for the most part lack any reason to bother trying to. 
---
All of that I could overlook though, because I absolutely loved that game, but the one thing I cant and the one thing that made me abandon it for good was the utter lack of care for the games stability. The game was once one of the best optimized games I had ever played, I remember getting it when it launched and playing it on my dying toaster of a stock dell I had back in the early days of wow. I ended up building an entire new computer just for that game. Now though, the game is just in shambles performance wise. I know people with year old builds that struggle in player heavy areas, stuttering at as low as 15fps. They gutted much of the fun visual features in the game, things like aura stacking with legendaries and spell effects for different professions, and then subsequently introduced fucking particle infusions as the goldsinks for end game. Now literally every player stacks as many of these as they can, causing everyone to look like globs of sparkling pixie shit, and making the game absolutely chug because of it. Even in zones that arent populated, the once gorgeous painting esc artstyle now looks choppy and under optimized, it physically hurts my eyes playing it for very long.
---
TLDR: Anet broke my heart by shitting all over the corpse of that game.
---
I find it hilarious that the PvPers are killing their own server by being like this. AQ event? Have fun with that.
---
Great write-up. "This is Water" indeed.
---
However, call me a skeptic, but it seems like the world (not WoW) is only going to get more selfish. Commitment and responsibility? Those are words that kids and EVEN ADULTS seldom use.
---
I think a huge reason why the 27+ age crowd plays WoW and how the community has blown up is because.... we all realize that life (in game or outside game) is much more fun when you start helping others. And helping others IRL isn't always easy, shit requires money and you just don't meet strangers that need help that easily, but in game, kindness to a stranger goes a long way.
---
For the horde. :D
---
Healing mace + int/healing shield
---
That loses dps to gain a very very marginal amount of heal power and possibly some aoe (if split holy) but doesn’t help you because you’ve not the gear or resources to take advantage of what it offers at that level.
---
When was the "you're in combat!" pulse added?  I certainly remember surviving wipes.
---
The way to kill someone in booty bay without being attacked is to kill someone outside of booty bay?
---
Good advice.
---
It's like lvl 44 but you can probably dps it earlier than that.
---
Are you the rogue that tried to gank me on a road yesterday that got his cheeks clapped?
---
I’m totally new to wow, can someone explain what’s going on here? Like, is it organised pvp? Two clans agreed to fight or what?
---
ah,
---
Well next time 3 raids try to gank them they are probably going to achive it since they dont have LoE anymore
---
The image you don't think is the shimmering flats is 100% the shimmering flats. You can tell by the colour of the ground, and by the bleachers she's standing beside.

A thousand times this.
---
Honestly though this just sounds like pure narcissism. The need for everyone to know who/what you are and accept/agree with it or you refuse to play? 
---
Get over yourself. You're not important , none of us are. Just play the fucking game.
---
Why? As long as everyone agrees beforehand there's literally no issue

Only viable reason if its a named boss mob he was waiting for an hour.

Delays hard coded not allowed.  Staggering in gcds to match shit up with no regard to latency is, but it’s really bad gameplay.

PoM pyro has big downtime and primarily excels at PvP. While fun, frost has more going for it across all fronts (ST, AoE, Survivability, Kiting)
---
All right good to know
---
Hey dude it’s me! We probably killed him like 4 times after he kept trying for some reason and then both had to go to work :) was fun, I’ll see ya on later haha!
---
As a prot warrior, this triggers me.
---
If you need items, just fill the role that uses those items.  No one should care if the healer is taking cloth or the dps is rolling for mail/plate.
---
I feel like you’re making things unnecessarily difficult for yourself by passing on items you clearly need to avoid potential drama.
---
TOS! Im telling BLizzard!! 
---
JK.  I feel for you man. I had a friend I lost too while playing this game and playing classic just revived all those feels for me.
---
Tbf, Herod is hugely populated rn
---
You can do most of the collecting of gold by just playing the game.  Just don’t buy anything you don’t absolutely need.

Huh? Don't I have to be able to target them to trade?
---
I rerolled from warrior to Druid. Never looked back.
---
The closest thing I can relate to this situation is when you were little and would tell someone else you were gonna get your friends/family members to beat them up and they would say they were gonna get theirs, except you do and it's an all out war in the world...of warcraft.

Damn it's like they're playing world of cuddlecraft or something...

&gt;I think it will be worth the 400g in the long haul!

And TBH there's very gold sinks in vanilla anyways.

How do wands (specifically their damage) work?
---
I am leveling as S-Priest. I have 5 points into Shadow Focus (10% greater chance to hit with Shadow spells). Does this effect wands too? I have a fire wand currently and I noticed a Fire Elemental was immune.
---
He actually just died about 4-5 times before we gave up killing the poor bloke. Kept ambushing us too and just dying.
---
I don't understand why you are getting downvoted, for healer this is the most optimal path. ZF Cleave then BRD BiS  hunting starting from 52, some drop rates are incredibly low and there are a lot of quests. Then Stratholme Live/UD spam with Argent Dawn trinket, toss in Attunement quests and In Dreams quest.
---
This is why you are right, lots of healing gear in BRD.

Hmmmm those are some good ideas to grief the annoying mages who don't feel like letting the rest of us play lol
---
But how else can I make up for my lack of personality
---
Paladin will give you more role options while leveling. But *when healing*, priest will be far more versatile. Paladins' healing toolkit is very limited, whereas priests get a different heal for every situation, so can adjust their strategy immediately to best match the damage coming in.
---
If you want to have the most fun *while healing*, choose priest. If you want to be able to switch it up and also run as tank or DPS, choose paladin.
---
Keep in mind that at endgame, most raids will want you to heal, regardless.
---
You mean with arcane explosion?
---
In his defense, had another item dropped that he couldn't roll on, one of you would have been the ninja, hohoho
---
Don't forget that theres no forge.  Rip engineers and blacksmiths
---
Like all end game fishing, it’s seasonal and changes.
---
But the guy you’re responding to was right
---
LC. Nobody uses /roll outside of pugs.  Some guillds might pick 2-3 people and tell them to roll, but that’s still LC.
---
Holy crap. I'm basically illiterate aren't I?
---
Mordhau (death stroke) is literally beating the other guy's head in with the hilt of the sword. 
---
It works because armor doesn't protect against bludgeoning as well as slashing. If the sword has pointed quillons, then it can penetrate armor easily.
---
There was an old one back in vanilla.   I’ve been thinking of writing a simple one myself since I can’t find it. 
---
Just checks ignore list on party joining and posts alert if asshats in group.
---
Banned for Account Sharing.
---
I am really damn impressed! While I think Blizzard is going to go the easy route and just make Burning Crusade servers, I would them to take your ideas and implement them if they did decide to do a sort of Classic+ thing.
---
I'm leveling as ret and have a healing set for dungeons. When running dungeons, I will need for my main spec (ret) and if an upgrade for my healing set drops, I will check with my group and ask if I can need. If someone else needs it for their main spec, I pass.
---
Works pretty well so far.
---
Agreed. Rolled mage because I wanted to shoot fireballs at people's faces.
---
No, you're out of the loop because OG in fact has completely stomped the worlds top teams in the way in which it is *actually possible* to do so within the game. 
---
Ask for impossible criteria and of course you can declare yourself 'right', but that'd be idiotic. If you're not able to discuss the merits of the game as it actually functions then you're not capable of discussing the game full stop.
---
yes a gnome, i am new to wow and just figuring stuff as i am going.
---
In what situation?
---
Why would you ignore the stun?
---
Either way, it gives you 2 Combo points for 60 Energy in one Global Cooldown.
---
SS would need 2 GCDs and a total of 90 energy.
---
So I would definitely use it over SS to open.
---
Personally, this week is when the life crumbling around me has started to catch up.  Getting ready for that weekend though!
---
They avoid being out in the world EVERYWHERE. It's insane.
---
I don't even see them going to BRD / LBRS / UBRS anymore. 
---
Why even roll on a pvp server to exclusively grind inside instances because it's "more efficient".
---
You're taking a pvp server and trying as hard as you can to turn it into a pve experience.
---
Just doesn't make sense to me I guess.
---
&gt; The top two alliance guilds haven't moved anywhere.
---
Yet. Give them 3-4 weeks.
---
So they take 50g worth of gear for 3g repair in 1 run
---
From the tanks point of view just replace all those dps icons with taunt.
---
Quite possibly the only movie that matters in my life.
---
This.  As far as my personal memory (played a rogue main through Molten Core/BWL in-era) vanish wouldn't save you in a boss fight unless you were the only one left on its agro table.  If you vanished and the boss was still active against at least one other person, it would \*immediately\* force you back into combat.
---
So in your original post, you would've needed to wait until you saw everyone else dead and Garr was targeting you (using this as the indicator that you're the only one left on its agro table), and \*\*then\*\* vanish.  Then you'd have survived.
---
Today I had a rogue on sm graveyard who lost stam + agi axe to our warrior tank and was so salty about it that he rolled need on a +spell power/healing dagger
---
there wouldn't be any mobs, the level range is more like the level range of stormwind
---
Our current main tanks in molten core are two feral druids in pre raid bis with 100 FR sets and it's an absolute joke.  They're fine.
---
As soon as i hit 40 i started to play other games again ( not quitting wow) but instead of grinding more i logged off in the inn and played others for a couple days. 
---
It really does a lot for preventing burn out and keeping the game fun
---
people will migrate towards anything with less syllables, unfortunately
---
You forgot shadow priest. :)
---
How feasible is focusing on Imp as a Demonology/Destruction Warlock?
---
I'm torn between Shadow Priest, Bear/Resto Druid, and the above kind of Warlock for my alt. I am not a huge fan of multi-dotting, and love the tankiness aspect of Warlocks, and always loved Imp for being ranged. If I have to go with Succubus or Felhunter to be feasible that's fine, I'd just prefer an Imp if he won't get gibbed by Soul Link/do pathetic damage.
---
255g on my server right now. Only one, though.
---
Wondered this too. I stopped using Steam Link because I couldn’t figure it out.
---
Someone whose probably on a lot of those lists I’d think.
---
I do. That is why I said it was the best I could find. Directionally, it’s a place to start and validated OPs viewpoint about Sekram.
---
It's one of the newer servers (Netherwind), so not as many people higher level yet. Also, medium pop, so not as many people period.
---
Also 90% of the Alliance I encounter just want to do their thing and level up and we generally just ignore each other. As a Warrior, I accept that I'm the worst 1v1 class in the game until I reach 60 and get geared, so I don't even try to gank.
---
I don't think it matters honestly - just find a server and a guild you enjoy being around and enjoy the game with them as a group.
---
Before you jump in that it's different for you... I am gay (out for 15+ years now) and in my 40s and the last thing I think I would ever want to do is to pick a server based on that fact.  For a humorous reference - I tried a gay cruise once back in 2004 because I thought it would be great to be on a cruise surrounded only by people like me.  Well by the end of that cruise I was about ready to jump in the ocean and swim for it... I got literally gay'ed out and didn't want to be around any gay people for a few months after that.  Sometimes (IMO - you are entitled to yours) you can overdo it.
---
I just think for me personally it's beneficial to go out and do things in the world (or in this game) where you don't stay in our little bubble of gayness.  Just find people that appreciate you as a player and as a person and go from there.  I played a normal server back in Vanilla and met a lot of great people who could care less what our sexuality was.  We had a get together in Dallas, we had another get together in Vegas a few years later and I am still friends with a number of them... some are married, some are single, some are gay, some are straight, some have kids - but in the end we just enjoyed a game together.
---
Don't make it more complicated than it needs to be.  Meet people different from yourself.  Sorry - I rambled on but I hope my genuine point comes through.
---
I think a zeppelin moves from undercity to ogrimar
---
Mobs will reset once they’re past their leash range unless you hit them within 10 seconds. That’s why the other user is recommending to use Arcane Explosion.
---
I found Warlock (more specifically BG's) boring for PvP. I would run around dotting everything I could but never really focus any one person too much. Next thing I knew I would have 10 more kills than the next person on my team, but never felt like I beat anyone. Most times someone else would do 75% of the damage, they would run away, and die to my dots. 
---
I liked that I could melt faces, but after awhile it was kind of boring. I swapped to Feral in BC (cause I thought they were shyte) and had a lot more fun in pvp
---
Yep, I'm not switching to t2 from it unless I have the set bonuses.
---
Also, t2 looks a million times better. Gotta be stylish.
---
Also, I'm still in 75g of debt from crafting my truefaith. Almost done!
---
Pretty sure you cant realm transfer from PvE -&gt; PvP
---
Who the hell reserves in a PUG *raid*?
---
it's explored.
---
it's for the scepter chain.
---
I'm more impressed with the slaghides, wonder what they rolled.
---
The rogue killed me almost every exchange,  but the hunter finished him off nearly every time.
---
It will be a bit of a jog, but at level 6 you could probably make it to Mulgore.  I'd recommend getting to like 11-12 in your own starting area and meeting at the Crossroads in The Barrens.
---
1v1 me in the Charred Vale boi, I’ll clap them cheeks
---
People will never live up to your expectations.
---
Enjoy the ban lol. Can't wait for shorter queue times when 90% of the mages in game get banned for abusing this shit
---
I was in WC yesterday and half the group who died bailed because the druid "was a noob who didn't buy rez." I looked it up and they dont get it until level 56!
---
the demon armor buff that warlock has give them hp in combat. and some spells can give HP too and if youre at full health then thats basically a waste of regen that you can use for mana.

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE WHY CAN'T I OBJECTIFY WIMMEN IN MY VIDJA ANYMORE?!
---
I'd rather tank for him than ever talk to you again
---
Blizzard has always had a rule that you cannot transfer from a PvE server to a PvP server. You *can* transfer from PvP to PvE though. It's certainly possible that they will allow transfers to any server type from any server type when transfers are available, but I wouldn't count on it.
---
Haha, it definitely *seamed* like it.
---
I am been switching between typing things in German for practice, so I have caught myself accidentally substituting a German word for an English word before this
---
Isnt this just subjective tho, kind of a shit example to use.
---
If you are like level 50 or less then you won’t kill her even as a team of 5 rogues, and even tank+healer+3 rogues is still questionable. She is destroying melee classes. 
---
If you are level 60 it might be an easier experience, but you can instead just ask a hunter to farm those rings for you for some reward. They take 20-50g per ring on my server, which is not a big deal on level 60, and they are just perfectly designed to do this job.
---
But they have spirit?
---
I'd rather have no fun at all than repeating the same jokes over and over and over.
---
2 combo pts vs 1, doesnt cost any energy, yeah its better
---
Dude happens all the time. I'm like wowow
---
I was in STV the other day on my warrior questing alone and two alliance (pally and lock) walk near me but then by me.  They clearly want to quest and don’t wanna tussle so whatever.  The symbiosis continued as we all slaughtered trolls and then some similarly leveled rogue pops out and tries killing the lock, dies because there’s a pally there to heal through his nonsense and then the dude whispers asking why I didn’t help.   Never assume people are as dumb as you are.
---
I got bad news for you.
---
There are 2 loot slots from rend.
---
Loot A and Loot B.
---
The WoWhead drop %s dont care if it drops in either of these slots.
---
However, for this even to happen, they have to occupy both slots individually.
---
Ya I haven’t gone on any binge killing sprees lately so I should be fine lmao
---
You don’t need prot talents to tank early on. Hell, going prot is probably worse because you’re missing out on all the rage generation talents/damage talents, and that’s your biggest issue pre-endgame.
---
I just dinged 40 and most of what I read suggests Shadowform is the best DPS. Will put my next 5 points into wand spec tho
---
I have heard that you can change your engineering specialization without dropping the profession entirely, but I'm not sure how. I think you click on a book in Tanaris somewhere.
---
I haven't lost to any mages on my huntard yet. Even the one that chased me when I had no pet for 10 minutes until i got it rezzed. Then again, bombs kinda ruin the whole frost nova and cast in deadzone thing, following a feign death/trap (assuming it works). By then im usually able to get back to range and kiting them to death.
---
You gotta play the long game on that one my friend
---
*hugs*
---
We have been 10 years away from being murdered by the climate for 30 years and STILL nobody listens!!  Now you make light of this heroic young person owned the Orange Man?!  Do you even science bro?
---
Nah man. Searing Gorge is the real Vietnam. It's fucking tiny and everyone bottlenecks at the exact same points.
---
Nope lol. At least he didn't do Stank with an accented A like most boneheads do
---
If it’s any perspective I’m currently level 58, and 44-48 was my favorite leveling bracket so far
---
Unless it's Anthem or the MMO Fallout game. Watching those two train wrecks crash and burn was hilarious
---
ah, i dont have tht kind of tim to reroll. Just having fun playing wow rn. Guess i will just go with the ugly gnome mount.
---
They got it, go play retail, every spec is viable even if it isn't optimal and ofc nothing feels unique. Classic was made because people wanted classic, flaws and all. Noones denying it's full of imbalances, but that's what a lot of people want. Start changing it then may as well go back to retail.
---
Was looking for a group for the quest Dark Storms, can't solo it in any way as a warrior.  
---
After asking general chat a couple times over about 10 minutes, one of my messages was "I need help on Dark Storms", not classy exactly but not really warranting (IMO) an ignore with a passive-aggressive message.
---
If you had a clue you'd realize warriors are the most insane Vanilla/Classic DPS and the fastest speed clearing guilds stack their raids with 10-12+ geared fury warriors.
---
Warriors are pretty damn good in preraid gear, and they only get better from there.  BWL and beyond, DPS warriors are absolute monsters.  Not inviting a DPS warrior to a group is just gimping your damage for no reason.
---
Wands deal damage of a certain elemental type, whatever is listed for that particular wand (in your case, fire damage). They do not count as spells, though, and as such they are unaffected by stats such as spell power/crit/hit chance. Their damage text is white, like melee weapon attacks. Effectively, they are just weapons that deal elemental damage instead of physical damage (and have a different auto attack mechanic that uses the global cooldown and requires you not to move). AFAIK, the only way to directly increase wand damage is through talents which increase their damage.
---
Throughout the game, elementals are typically immune to damage of their type (e.g. fire elementals immune to fire damage, water elementals immune to frost damage, etc.), so the fire elemental being immune to your fire wand's damage had nothing to do with your spell hit percentage.
---
As I understand it, since wands deal elemental damage, they are affected by effects which increase or reduce damage of that type dealt to a target. This would mean that an effect such as Shadow Weaving (later on in the shadow talent tree) would increase the amount of damage you deal to a target with a wand that does shadow damage. If that's wrong, someone please correct me!
---
Also, putting the full 5 points into Shadow Focus is often not worth the investment. Your chance to hit a target of your own level with a spell (meaning it is not resisted) is 96%. It is 95% for a target one level higher than you, 94% for a target two levels higher than you, and then plummets to 83% for a target three levels higher than you. Because of this huge drop, typically only either two or three points are placed into Shadow Focus, as the 17% (actually 16%, due to 1% of that being impossible to remove) spell hit cap is impractical to reach without high levels of gear.
---
i hit 60 with over 150 deaths due to ganks. not a single 1v1, lol.
---
Just sounds like a bad mage tbh
---
WTF is that enemy radar addon on the right, that' some OP shit.
---
It's the shaman's biggest weakness. 
---
I'd recommend using lower rank spells, and either cooking your own or buying the fish food that gives you Mana regen. 
---
You basically just have to control a little more when you go Balls to the Wall or want to conserve a little bit of mana.
---
even uif someone started questing in tht area from lvl 1?
---
might be old school but back in my day you could tell how serious they were by the application process. i've filled out apps that were like job applications, then had to voice interview, then was put on a two week trial while i played with them / hung around to make sure i was a good fit. etc. 
---
they will also answer almost all those questions in their recruitment information on their website, etc.
---
Fuck Paladins
---
You can go at anytime. Just take the zeppelin
---
Okay, well those were choices that you made
---
&gt; I also make 40-50g/hr farming Mara.
---
Ahh now it makes sense, that's damn good gold per hour. Can rogues farm Mara?
---
I know this feel. After a bunch of 40+ horde invaded and camped the wetlands, I went over to stonetalon and just deleted everyone in my path, regardless if they were grey, green, or whatever
---
How fast is mage aoe grinding compared to regular questing, have a 30 day ban on my main account, considering leveling a mage up to 30 quickly to keep playing with my best friend as it is their first time playing.
---
Yeah, but it doesn’t fix the bare arms/upper shoulders, nor the occasional thong plate... I don’t mind sexy armor here and there, but I’m a Paladin damnit and sometimes I just really wanna enjoy the fantasy of being an overconfident crazy bitch charging straight into the thick of things cause I’m invincible. 😂
---
This comment radiates small zug energy.
---
Nice, got any suggestions on talents? I don't think I'll want all 5 in rage stance swap since, if I remember correctly, you really only swap at the start for charge&gt;ww&gt;defensive.
---
Last stand seems fun since so many wipes I've had on my main would've been won if the tank was alive for only like 4 seconds longer.
---
What's with the 'classes' bit?  Is that an add on?
---
You could moon icon it.
---
As a mage questing on a pvp server do I use ice armor or magic?
---
Uhh a good hunter should beat a mage every time. No question. 
---
If you don't have engineering / nades, that's your own fault but there's a plethora of tools for hunters to deny mage deadzone strat. 
---
A good hunter will never lose to even the best mage if they have all their proper cooldowns and utility. 
---
But yes mage shits on warrior hard. The hunter in this video was absolute megatrash.
---
Idk why but this creeped me the eff out too. *shudder*
---
No kidding, unless you were way ahead of the initial push your statement is way more true.  And the 2 or more goes both Factions.  More often then not I'm hitting groups of Horde in STV running around just killing people.  Most of the time they run by when solo, or they wait until you pull a couple mobs and try to jump you.
---
Maybe you should try playing dumb instead of reading into a meme bro. Lmao
---
This argument is no longer valid since fascists held a straight pride parade.
---
I knew a Grand Marshall in Vanilla who specifically ate this food for that purpose in World PvP and BG's.
---
&gt; Tanking gear, sure. Main spec &gt; off spec. But if it is items that are just as needed for dps as for the tank or the tank wants some dps gear and reserves that, thats where I draw the line. 
---
Nobody's forcing you to go on these runs.  If the tank is hosting/leading a dungeon crawl with reserved loot, then you either take it or leave it.
---
For many people, it's better to do the run and possibly not get to roll on one item, rather than sitting in town waiting for a tank.
---
&gt; Thats basically telling other people that your time is more important than their time because you are the vip and they are not.
---
You're just viewing this whole thing the wrong way.   If a player only needs one specific item from a dungeon, then it makes perfect sense for him to setup a group where that one specific item is reserved.   **That what only people who don't want that item join his group.**
---
That's more loot-efficient for everybody.
---
Me and my rogue boi can come clap your shit for a few hours if you want
---
Yeah if attacking horde is significantly going to slow down my own ability to quest I usually don't do it. Why potentially start a war and have us spend all of our time attacking each other rather than just killing mobs?
---
But if it's not going to slow me down? Then, like the meme says - fuck 'em. I don't care if they're 10 levels under me, if they cross my path I'll kill 'em. Just repaying all the ?? hordies that have killed me. To be fair, I never camp low levels (or anyone for that matter). Killing someone once is "fuck 'em." Completely camping someone to the point they have to spirit res and go somewhere else is just BM.
---
Atal'ai Spaulders of the Monkey, Slaghide Gauntlets of the Monkey, Bone Ring Helm, Warbear Harness, Vosh'gajin Strand (guessing), Naglering...
---
22 days /played?
---
Not sure about that.
---
Most people want to make better use of their time then going around killing the opposite faction without any actual benefit from it Phase 2 will be a whole different story.
---
&gt;mind control them off a ledge
---
god I loved arathi basin
---
This is how it is on my server. Most people are questing. Sometimes we fight but generally people just go on about their business.
---
I think you're in a "deadzone" almost. Lots of casual players are probably mid/low 30s, lots of grinders are 55+. That being said, I feel like I see A LOT of people between 40-50 on my server.
---
Only impressive for the ignorant.
---
Have you ever considered that most people havent even been trying to PvP yet?  I dont have my bars set up for PvP at all since I would rather concentrate on leveling.
---
Classic aura durations.  Addon
---
I’m assuming you’re on a PvP server, but once I hit 40 I started working on niche PvP items and very early pre-raid BIS. 
---
Items like 
---
Skull of Impending Doom (run speed and polymorph protection)
---
Nifty Stopwatch (run speed)
---
Swift Boots (run speed)
---
Carrot on a Stick (mount speed)
---
Or 
---
Rune of the Guard Captain (+hit trinket lvl 46)
---
Woven Ivy Necklace (STR/AGI/STAM lvl 46)
---
Most of that stuff is in STV, Badlands, Tanaris and Hinterlands which is where you’ll be leveling next.
---
I found [sixtyupgrades.com](https://sixtyupgrades.com) last night and it’s a godsend for finding the next upgrade you need to work on.
---
You both miss the point of "Classic community" - you were right to be annoyed, he shouldn't have put something on reserve without telling you first.
---
But, having said that, you didn't need to post this after the fact, either.
---
The matter is over, nobody wins. I'm glad this didn't effect you, but at the same time, just try to let it go. He's an idiot, leave it at that. He won't have friends, and you'll continue just fine. Good luck, friend!
---
If you get the spawns to yourself (you won’t) and don’t die (you will) it’s quicker than norma questing as the xp is constant.
---
I'd kill to go back and experience WoW for the first time again. Enjoy it!
---
The last thing EVE PvP is is boring - there being actual consequences for losing and risks for using valuable assets means that encounters can very easily get your heart pounding.
---
WoW PvP can get intense and very deep, but nothing in the game can approach that sort of emotional response for one simple reason - no consequences of any significance.
---
This is the optimal rotation I'm pretty sure. My buddy who is insane at mage uses that exact combo for aoe pulls. As a lock I wait until the flamestrike is about to go off then start my hellfire, that way even if I get some aggro they will be nova'd. I'd usually only do about 50% of his damage though, and the rogue in our farm group kept complaining about feeling useless, haha.
---
Lazy comeback for a lazy mind
---
I just calculated it and I’m playing 9 hours a day on average according to my /played
---
I work a full time job and I’ve taken no days off, the addiction is real  😓
---
Nah, no one actually does this really.
---
The very few times ive seen this done is when all other grp members hit "greed" and someone wants to need but feels the need to justify or explain it (need for offspec, etc)
---
None of the loot is really that important anyway to have to sit and discuss it before the item even drops.
---
Word, I'll need decursive eventually anyway. Thanks!
---
Wotf lmao, what if OP is literally any race but UD.
---
Dont think you actually need to be prot to tank MC
---
you can still vanish with a dot on you and it'll break the snare, and you will have a chance to cheap shot if you're close before the tick breaks vanish. Only Faerie Fire is the one preventing vanish entirely
---
I think we're just hearing about the bad mages, there are good mages out there too!

same here. I want to ability to play anywhere since I don't get a ton of time to play anymore. I've never owned a laptop in my life so I have no clue where to start
---
And there is also people who play 10% of pvp and 90% of PvE. Dont blame me I dont do pvp.
---
I love getting the tiny buff from a noggen and then eating a Savory Deviate delight. It's funny AF to see me on my Pinto hauling around super small.
---
As a Druid I don't have any problems with PvP. Alliance in my quest spot? I kill them or annoy them until they leave. If I keep attacking them when they pull mobs they won't stay around long. If I kill them and camp their corpse once or twice they won't come back. I then get mobs to myself or help other Horde out by getting rid of other questers. I can see how it can be annoying on some other classes though.
---
Just hit 40 and got my mount but I stopped my leveling guide to run some SM groups and now I'm several levels ahead of where I was so having a hard time finding a good jumping back in point.  Thinking maybe it's time to just scrap the guide and find a good zone to quest in without one.  What's a good place to go?  I hopped into badlands briefly before logging last night and did the coyote quest but the competition for birds and elementals was crazy so I couldn't get that done easily.  Wound up just grinding some whelps up in the corner for a little while but xp from that alone seemed pretty low.  I'm not sure what other zones are good choices at 40.
---
This one sounds lightweight and I like it. Thanks!
---
or better yet, locks that use hellfire on a 1 or 2 mob pull. like bro you're an absolute downer and deserve to not be healed
---
Is that sarcasm? How is you being sarcastic and adding nothing to discuss more valuable than me pointing out that killing someone on a PVP server is not inherently being an asshole or "getting joy from pissing someone off"? Perhaps your comment is a "valuable contribution" though and you actually meant well, in which case, thanks.
---
Ive been really really enjoying owl for my leveling pet. Screech drops it's dps a little but it can easily tank 2-3 mobs at a time without too much issue as it can drop their damage to nearly nothing while also being pretty tanky itself.
---
It is difficult because of hit. Off topic, but something I’ve enjoyed is dw arms from 30-40, the overpower procs are awesome woth a fast offhand
---
They were trash.
---
Careful, his edge might cut
---
PvP balance in vanilla is exactly how MMORPG balance should be. Classes are distinct and heterogeneous, and thus some classes have clear advantages over others. You’ll never get away from this unless you make all classes have essentially the same abilities, which is what’s happened in retail.
---
In vanilla, every class has a role in group pvp,  and every class can be useful. And every class has other classes that they counter. And that’s how it should be.
---
Siphon Life is almost never worth the mana. It heals exactly what it costs over 30 sec. In a dungeon the only things that last that long are last boss.
---
I mean he's not wrong. It's a PvP server, killing the other faction is literally the point.
---
Yep, and yep.
---
Was funny as hell. I was super low level, but guildies being guildies, they ran me through. All thought it was just a favor, and EVERYONE but me got an upgrade.
---
I agree, the hunter in that clip didnt do much and most mages I run into as a warrior are easy to predict but their kit is just so faceroll against me that I have to play my heart out to beat an average mage/not let them get away.
---
honestly I think the fear might just be a bit bugged right now that's all.
---
Nope. PvP balance changes affect the entire game. Keep it as it is.
---
Something I thought of: There are always higher-tier players wanting to do lower-tier raids for things like Bindings. These players make the runs easier and faster while also taking less loot from them than a fresh 60 would. They essentially function as catch up mechanics. For a fresh 60 Molten Core becomes easier, faster, and gives more loot.
---
Off the plank wit yer.
---
A 50s tip on something conjured out of thin air is more than enough.
---
Being serious, read the 1989 UN report on climate change.  15 years before you were born no doubt.
---
Pfffffft 60? I have a combined 120 levels ^^^over ^^^6 ^^^chars
---
Um, yeah, it really is. Discord is a vastly superior platform for community building.
---
robes of the exalted is only very very very slightly worse. even the most hardcore guilds dont waste gold on it because in the long run it is a big mistake. you're going to regret it later on. 
---
gold is a resource required to perform well in raids later on in classic. so you spent 400 gold to be MAYBE 1 percent stronger now but will hurt you a lot later on.
---
Its not engaging intelligently. Ita being unable to understand why anyone would find something mkre exciting than the game youre obsessed with.

I ran it at 37 with lock and had that felt fine.  I wasn't getting too many resists, even on the final boss.

I've always loved healing and played priest in retail during WOTLK where I could go shadow or holy in raids and go disc for pvp, so yeah I do. Personally I kind of wish I had rolled something with a bit more depth for classic though.

RFK not SFK
---
Yeah... to the tanks that do that, it’s only working cause I’m drinking until you’re at 50% health and wasting half the duration of my water that’s 1g 60s a stack. Stop please.

Against games rules. This is actually like the only rule they enforce too (besides standing on rooftops). Delet.
---
&gt; /spit
---
Classy
---
Even in Vanilla the 40-end game zone gap has always felt that way. I think right now especially everybody either pushed hard and is already 55+ or are dicking around and capping out in the 20-35 range.
---
You can check for your server specifically here:. http://classicrealminfo.com/
---
Well yeah this is BRD, APES avoided Barrens for a reason dude.
---
Yea I dunno just “join a guild to finish quest” seems like not good advice. Like, yes you could do that, but you could also just get two hand drops from SM that can help you.
---
I dunno it’s different for everyone for sure. I have high lvls helping me and a large wow network. Doing that solo though is difficult.
---
So at least one 10/10 cutie streams classic. Lol
---
One of my friends levelled a priest all the way to 60, and was the first person in our guild to reach 60. He almost immediately dropped it and his warrior alt is now also 60.
---
Dude, its a joke
---
60 Mage in WPL pulled like ten guys to AOE em down. Cheap shot into kidney shot and watched them eat him alive.
---
Fuck 'em
---
Same, but I've also seen just as many comments saying that was added post-vanilla, and can't find any confirmation whether it's a thing in Classic :\
---
Buddy just sent me the mage patterns he found in lbrs last night... spending all my gold on them essences tonight and getting that last bit of xp to ding 57 and equip it... gonna be a good night
---
Same here, getting rid of mana management as a mage made the game boring, even with the triggers
---
Last time I leveled a character in retail I took off 75% of my gear just hoping to make Mor'ladim somewhat difficult for old times sake... He still wasn't hard.
---
Thats when you kindly inform them that there is a Need/Greed rolling mechanic, and if they don't want people needing gear that is good for them then they should stack the party with people that dont use the gear
---
I am playing a hunter atm because I watched a video telling me it is the easiest to lvl but I am not really sure if I am enjoying playing it (level 26). Maybe need to try a different class on an alt but no idea what to make.
---
JAFFA KREE!!!
---
You come into my life bring only joys, are you Santa, and do you happen to play on Sulfuras
---
That is bannable and you should delete this post.
---
Fine, I’ll burn my car in gasoline and burn some of the old tires laying around my house too.
---
I don't usually gank, but when I do, it's because some Ally is about to kill the mob I need.  Unless you can prove otherwise, that's *actually* my mob you're killing and even if I didn't want to kill you, I am more than willing to if your death will save me waiting around for another 4 or 5 minutes for the respawn.  Fighting over resources is like the entire point of playing on a non-RP PvP server, isn't it?  FTH!
---
Yeah if I join an instance and the mage hands over like 120 water, I'll throw them a tip as a thank you cause that's above and beyond, but otherwise, it's part of being in a group. Same as using stuff that costs reagents to cast etc, but that's actually costing me money to cast, whereas the mage water is free v0v
---
Never understood it.  Seems utterly fucking pointless lol,  it's like playing with cheat codes on and running to your parents to show them how good you are
---
Ok but they are the best at doing it, making it inherently amazing, no?
---
Like your argument would work if there was any other group who could do the same thing in a comparable time frame, but no one can. They are literally the best in the world at it. It might just be the same thing, but no one is able to replicate their success.
---
Are you seriously trying to argue this?
---
Enjoy 15% cut on the neutral AH
---
I feel like I made a mistake rolling on Faerlina with a buddy. I am really burned out with the amount of ganking that I deal with while trying to quest. They are offering free server transfers but only to other PvP servers do you know if I can opt to pay for a transfer can I go from PvP to PvE? I did a bit of looking online today and it looks like outside of the free offering that Bliz is making [you cant even realm transfer.
---
]( https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/244160)
---
I'm level 44 now and have no desire to start all over but the amount of time I am spending running back to my body is really sucking the fun out of it for me. I know its my fault for being on a PvP server but man I would jump to PvE in a heartbeat if I could.
---
Mana issues are more or less the case for all casters in Classic/Vanilla.
---
For Shaman, I think the main issue is that they don't get much in the way of obvious mana talents. Instead, you have to rely purely on your knowledge of the underlying game mechanics to glean efficiency - and most players (including those who write the guides) don't.
---
With Resto Shaman, the norm is a tick-tick-boom style of healing where you pair Healing Wave (rank 1) with your most efficient rank of Healing Wave (your highest rank with +0 healing, up to two levels down with lots of +healing). You do this to build stacks of Healing Way (and potentially proc Ancestral Healing) cheaply and then exploit it with more expensive spells.
---
Likewise, you try to emphasize Chain Heal as much as possible, potentially downranking to rank 2 (rank 1 downranking is a BC thing - you won't have enough spellpower in Classic/Vanilla to justify it).
---
For Elemental Shaman, you tend to have 'maximum burn' and 'efficient burn' modes - normally separated by a rank or two or downranking with Lightning Bolt - while you consume your Elemental Focus procs with Chain Lightning. Again, the amount of +nature damage matters here. Unfortunately, +nature damage is hard to find so Shaman tend to suffer in comparison to, say, Mages (who can just layer +frost everywhere).
---
That being said, these mana issues are by design. Blizzard's notion in Vanilla is that narrowly focused classes should be better than versatile classes at the most basic tasks (like damage or healing). One of the ways they did this was by making those narrowly focused classes better able to manage their mana.
---
I definitely agree with you in general.  I did, however, have a dude the other day who was new and very much unwilling to learn.  And was a dick from minute 1 rather than trying to...not be a dick?  It was definitely trying on my patience.
---
How does Need before Greed differ from Group Loot? You still have Need/Greed roles in Group loot
---
Huge arms, standing pose like they have chronic lower back issues, running like they have a stick up their ass and the worst possible casting animations.
---
I too was in shimmering flats yesterday and she was just wearing shorts not short shorts
---
Can you not enter RFK prior to level 25? If you have a high level friend running you through it, it shouldn't matter what level you are. If you don't have a friend helping you, you aren't going to get into an RFK group at 25.
---
That error speech triggered my PTSD.
---
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
I'm about half way to 49 on Herod and while I've definitely been ganked, I haven't been corpse camped once. People crying on reddit about it overblow it a lot.
---
Thanks for that reply!
---
How hard is rogue to play?\`I rarely see anyone talking about this. Everyone just statin they are way too overpowered but that was before 1.13 iirc?
---
Yeah thats pretty true with the Cds you just said
---
I really cant decide and its pissing me off personally :S
---
The best way to level the pet up is to bring him into dungeons. They don’t agro monsters as if they are low level but you still should make sure your group is fine with you being essentially petless.
---
I’ve been running brokentooth in 55+ dungeons with my guild and he’s still getting 2+ levels a run in the low 50s. I think he went from 37-41 in one lbrs.
---
RIP my kitty named Dougal. I love father ted. And I missed dougal instantly when I saw that name.
---
And then you killed all of them with your new axe?
---
Torilla tavataan
---
Nah. MOBAs are more for people who find arena matches entertaining.
---
Mail the stuff you want to sell to your alt so you don't have to keep going back and forth to town.  Also while I'm out questing I frequently log out and into my bank alt so that I can repost auctions.
---
That sounds like a name suitable for a female.
---
I agree. Should've /teabag him.
---
I like the idea of having trinkets and other gear almost function like retail talents. We saw it a little with trinkets like the Arcane Infused Gem or Renataki's Charm of Beasts. I like it because there's already those gates in place. You can only equip two trinkets at a time. To equip a new one means unequipping an old one.
---
If you have to stick to LGBT servers / communitys you are never gonna actually connect with anyone outside of it and keep living in this either fantasy or nightmare that everyone cares and have strong opinions about you.

ur bad
---
The reason why warriors are running around with 2 handers in zerker stance in pre lvl 55 dungeons is because these dungeons are a lot easier for us now than they used to be. 
---
The extra damage you take is negligible, and you do way more damage being able to whirlwind and cleave mobs down with the 2, hander, resulting in the dungeon getting cleared faster. 
---
Sometimes you take less damage overall in a pull by using a 2 hander. Some people forget that more damage is a form of mitigation. Quicker kills = less time taking hits.
---
Back in the day it was like my full time job to goof off instead of actually do productive things in-game. While my brother was grinding out SM I was busy finding out how to glitch through the floor in Stormwind. When he was saving for his mount I was hosting 1v1 duels between level 1 gnomes for 5 silver a pop. I've spent utterly TOO much time in the deep run tram. But I love those memories. I was truly living in that world instead of just exploiting it for things I wanted.
---
Most people seem to forget that hunters fill another role besides just dps...
---
Low incoming damage utility. 
---
We're the only viable range dps that isn't squishy. Being out of melee range and being mobile without a dps drop means we're not going to need to be healed as much as other dps classes. 
---
Rogues are gonna get cleaved to death. Mages are going to stand in fire.

Basically I get the sense that a lot of the non-healers just want to keep smashing buttons and bump up their dps chart numbers, while us regular healers get to carry water for that mentality.  I'm glad everyone is gets to keep smashing buttons while I get pound beverages to keep up with my more egregious groups.
---
Yeah if you're nova'd a decent mage will sit in the sweet spot and combo you. Also, warriors will hamstring, so even if you get a wing clip off you can't run too far, and rogues have the slow poison.
---
It does if you /stand immediately after taking the damage
---
Fair point. I would argue that CS is better when solo grinding, as the stun prevents damage coming your way, which limits downtime.
---
I'm hearing aetish is the one to go to, but yeah definitely. Like I'm a trans woman, heaven forbid I wanna avoid incessant transmisogyny

---
ah, lol.
---
I have seen some pictures and maybe short clips of this show but never seen a full episode.
---
Early on in vanilla dire bear form was 125% armor instead of 360%.
---
The mantra that bears can't tank was built on that, and by the time they made the change the ethos was set in stone, and you didn't have any bear tanks around to even try it out because no one had geared a druid to tank, and people weren't going to dump a thousand hours in dungeons and raids into gearing one up - all the while every group rejecting them from tanking - just as a test in those days.  
---
It wasn't until private servers you really got people willing to give it a go, and we discovered bears work perfectly well as offtanks, offer additional utility, and don't compete for the same gear as your main tanks in raids; and tank dungeons easily.
---
Star wars + could definitely be equated to wow retail though
---
You're most likely aware, but going to throw out that trying to class balance around arena has been on of the worst design decision in retail's history.
---
Warlock is another easy one to level. Quite different flavor compared to hunter.
---
Priest here. Can confirm.
---
Extra bag space, park it by the AH for easy scans and auctioning, mail them items you want to keep/use to save your self a trip to the bank (then click "return" on the thing you want back on your main"
---
Use the mail system as extra short term storage, use the bank alt's bank and bags as long term storage and AH warehouse.
---
Using mail and an alt helps keep your bags empty so you can spend more time grinding and looting instead of travelling to and from capitols.
---
Yeah I think pirateships meta is more developed in GW2 but I can see it quickly becoming a thing in WoW.
---
A fellow Aqua fan?
---
Thanks for the indepth analysis!
---
As a new wow player that video didnt look as impressive as it is. So your description really helped understanding whats going on :)
---
I feel like 12 armor is gonna be fairly insignificant for a warrior running a level 20 dungeon...
---
Not to mention that rogues need armor for leveling as well.
---
I fail to see how sexuality is relevant to server choice? Just play wherever your friends are lol or pick a server that meets your needs. I dont think any server is more or less open to LGBT people, at least not in my experience..
---
Can't seem to sell anything on AH for more than a vendor will pay. Other people easily got their mount at 40 but that has come and gone and I'm barely halfway there...
---
This may be unorthadox, and I don't know how your fishing is, but at lvl 38 I had 225 fishing and only 34g. I went to STV and ran up and down the west coast (Savage Coast) and fished out of all the oily blackmouth and firefin snapper pools, as well as (and especially) floating wreckage pools. There is a really good chance of getting Mythril Bound Trunks (even from the fish pools) that you can open and will always give 1-3 silver, bolts of mageweave or bolts of runecloth, heavy and rough leather, and it seems like 1/3 of the time i got lvl 30-40 BOE greens. I usually vendor the leather (AH prices for leather on my server are trash) but the bolts of cloth and boe greens auction very well. All said and done, it took one Sunday of fishing (maybe 8 hours) to get enough materials to afford the mount. Then just from questing from 38 to 40 i got another 20g in rewards and drops. If you don't like fishing this may not be the strategy for you.
---
Bro the average adult in America has a full time job. Stop basing your answers on the fact that there are outliers. The average American adult works 9-5. Don’t know why you can’t just admit that most people have better things to do than dedicate all their spare time on wow which is exactly what you’d have to be doing to hit 60 by now. 
---
Having your priority being a video game in your spare time for a month has nothing wrong with it,
---
My comment was purely conjecture so I was definitely wrong in that assumption
---
A twink has a pretty good chance against someone ~5 levels higher, and isn't totally useless against higher levels but it's not 'fair' unless the non twink is naked or being played by a potato.  Levels add too much miss/resist chance and green equipment ramps up from level to level quickly in the early levels.
---
Ever since I started my alt, my BTag Broadcast has been "Selling [Tough Jerky] 1g/hour"
---
If you have no mana regen per 5 on your character, you're not gonna regen mana dude. Stats matter.
---
I dont see any hunter multi shots there. Meh
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't a WoW sub come with access to all content up to Legion (BFA requires purchasing the xpac)?  If that's true you could try it yourself, since travel hasn't significantly changed between expansions.
---
Glory hole
---
At least on my server the devilsaur market is already collapsing. Everybody and their mother thought it would be the best way to make cash.
---
why do you want to be mad so badly? i'll never understand. we literally just want to play together, share stories, ask/receive advice, share resources, etc. i feel like it's small minded of you to assume that there's never a need for queers to reach out to one another, but go off i guess
---
Thats exactly my point, if you're a Hunter and your pet has been killed twice, simply don't summon it (to be on the safe side) until you are sure you arent going to be ganked again.
---
I cant remember the last time I knew or cared about anyone's sexual orientation on WoW.
---
And the trade-off is much less significant than it is for a warrior.
---
Exactly.
---
Even pretending that it affects every class equally, you can still argue the magnitude is too high.
---
Tip if you’re not already doing it, open up on Rogues with a dot, prevents them from going stealth.
---
I am 47 and I was thinking the same thing are you home smolderweb by chance?
---
This space is too public for that information.
---
Sad part is, you can play flawless and still lose. He can play mediocre and still win.
---
Never played a mage throughout vanilla/BC/Wrath/Cata. Get into classic and decide that now is my chance. MFW I am the new hunter
---
Holy shit dude those are cool. This is exactly, 100% what people mean when they say they want classic+. I just love the idea of the continents actually feeling complete, instead of having weird mountain ranges filling up country-sized chunks of land.
---
Classic wow is a mage/lock fuckfest
---
Accurate
---
I definitely disagree. I want to experience BC and Wrath again, and I am firmly #NoChanges
---
Did you know it's possible to buy gold?
---
I hate error messages
---
Got a 39 mage so i should be good. For some reason i thought it was a way higher level.
---
I see. But I'm not using any gathering addons. This is the default nodes from standard files.
---
Bots also pay for each account. They aren't fussed with it because it isn't botting.
---
Did we play the same game? GW2 wasn't optimized for shit. On launch I had an i5-3570k @ 5GHz and a GTX 680 which was the best of the best and my fps was rarely over 50. In massive WvW battles it would always be in the 20s and 30s.
---
I dislike any minority that intentionally lives in fear of connecting with other people due to made up fantasies/nightmares of them not being accepted. If you want to share stories or make friends with people from your minority that's cool, but you guys are making it your entire fucking live.
---
I'd wear cloth if it gave me 1 extra attack power.
---
The imp unfortunately is the worst pet for Soul Link, due to his abysmal  health pool, and the worst bonus from Master Demonologist (aggro reduction, which does absolutely nothing when soloing or in pvp).
---
The imp will also get absolutely destroyed in pvp unless you keep him phase shifted. As an upside, no one will suspect you are SL if you have an imp out :D
---
That said, play what you want man. It's not like it's unplayable, and if you ever feel the need to taste the "real" power of the spec, your felhunter or voidwalker is one shard away.
---
The one that gives you a fish as a reward..? &gt;&lt;
---
Go elemental at 40. I waited until 52 to make the switch and I regret waiting this long. Ask mages for water when you come across one to help with the cost of water.  Unless you’re killing mobs lower level than you enchantment is very mana efficient anyways.  But as other people have stated, shamans aren’t fast levelers in general. Just try to be as efficient as you can with your time. Hillsbrad, northern stv, shimmering flats and arathi all have a good amount of quests for your level range. Good luck!
---
Isn't skyrim a game that is actually more of a "classic era" game than a current era game?
---
nope, easy work around here.
---
me: horde  
---
you: alliance  
---
us: at 07:00am we both put a 15g item up for 10s
---
we buy out eachother,  goblins get sweet 15% of 10s
---
we now both have opposite items, which should be worth more at our side (because that is the whole idea behind this exercise) 
---
if you trust eachother you obviously don't have to keep the balance in check, you can just give your buddy items this way , knowing that some day he will pay it back in some form
---
They're not infected.
---
as a lock, dont worry about us unless a mob is actually hitting us (shouldnt), we have ways to heal ourselves over time.
---
If you need me, I'll be over to lady to rest.
---
I’ve seen a bunch of classic wow instagram pages selling gold too, kinda fcked up
---
Invisible pantsu and DBZ-style Sacred Dispel FTW!
---
Megumin is too flat and Darkness is overdressed.
---
He got plastic surgery to look Chinese and is totally free now.
---
yum ally
---
Still costs mana tho. I can shift about 4 times before going oom, not sure how it is at lvl 60 but its kindaaa annoying
---
I don't think it's bigotry as much as pointless. It's like asking "Is there a server for redheads?" What does hair color have to do with which server you pick?
---
Jesus put an NSFW tag on this
---
That's the exact same thing I did (hit level 46 last night). I quest/level at a good pace and I can heal just fine in dungeons. Holy spec is only needed when it comes to raiding. The main advantage to rolling holy while still leveling is you have a better chance at saving a group from a bad pull, but you're going to level slowly unless you do nothing but dungeon spam.
---
*edit - a word
---
Desolace a bit on the lower end but it is a change. There's other things in the Western island to explore.
---
Well those guys play vanilla together for years now. Maybe even a decade or more.
---
I'm a fan of Ultra, but my computer prefers Low.
---
Im def playing elemental at 60 but I heard elemental isn’t good at all for leveling, why switch ?
---
This is the first time i have ever played WOW. My brother used to play and got me into classic about 3 weeks ago. Needless to say i am ADDICTED.  I freaking love this game. I feel so lost and thats what i love. Exploring random areas, messing stuff up and learning the mechanics of dungeons. 
---
I tend to play 2-3 hours a night after work and enjoy every minute.
---
yeah i hear it on the daily in my guild chat lol, i need to find a new one. thanks a lot for the comment!
---
Could you explain?
---
The margins will exceed that cut in many cases
---
He's not wrong though. The video you provided literally has nothing to do with what you were talking about.
---
Yeah, I’d say it is. It’s not a healthy mindset to have about female characters or women in general, and alienates a part of the fan base
---
Not my strangest fap
---
[Loss Aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion) is a demonstrable recorded phenomenon of psychology. If you want a short-ish shallow pop science explanation, [Veritasium has a pretty good video on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBX-KulgJ1o).
---
Surprised they didnt get ganked by a full horde raid on Skeram
---
APES has world buffs(rallying cry of the dragon slayer) and are traveling to MC. The horde guilds want to stop them from going in and mess them up. APES using some fun tricks to beat the horde pretty easily despite much lower numbers. 
---
this is sorta the meta game for high end raiding guilds to show dominance. whoever controls black rock mountain are the chads, sadly for that servers horde the APES of ungoro run all of azeroth
---
Oh nice, that fits perfectly!
---
Feral dps is good while leveling. Druids have scaling issues end game but are better then most classes while leveling.
---
Here's a comparison.
---
There's a carpenter who makes a really good chair that a lot of people want and a lot of other carpenters try to make the same exact chair. But this carpenter, since he has been doing it for so long, can do it in 3 hours. No other carpenter in the world can do it in less than 20 hours.
---
This means that this carpenter is the best in the world by a large margin at it, and that is amazing, even though I can can make that same exact chair with no experience, it would take me 100 hours. 
---
There is skill in going fast at stuff, even if the stuff isn't hard on it's own, you know?
---
How does that work exactly? I'm engineering and would want to go Goblin, but Gnomish have a lot of fun items. 
---
Are you able to retain your gnomish engineering abilities after going back to 300? I thought I saw something somewhere that you could?
---
Ye I know, kinda like all PVP videos. 3 rows of buffs and fully equipped, you would not believe what happens next..
---
I picked up a Sparkleshell Mantle for 3g the other day. I’ll probably use it until I get Herod’s Shoulder!
---
Can’t speak to your question, but I have observed the same phenomena.
---
Nice assumptions there dumb ass. They item name was already exploited in chats which is why it was changed in the first place.
---
 And although it has nothing to do with it, and i wouldnt be ashamed to speak my mind if i was, I'm not white, so sorry to disappoint you. Quit being a snowflake and just play the damn game or dont. No one else cares about the name of the item. Just some losers that want something to blame "SJW"s. Grow up.
---
Or just her body vs leg proportions:
---
https://i.imgur.com/Z7oone2.png
---
Yeah now we are just stuck with a bunch of dogshit mages at level 60 that don’t have a clue how to play the game
---
LOOOOOL thats too damn funny. What server are you on? Lets do some random shit together if possible.
---
\-This is the one thing i hate about WOW. you cant bounce around servers to play with people. I came from runescape were you can go into any world at anytime, making it very easy to play with friends.
---
I mean he holds agro and you bitch on reddit about ppl pulling it
---
Sounds like you cant tank and he can lmao.
---
Should probably start spammin swipe
---
I used druid because it's the most extreme. What you said sounds like you have even less of a reason to want cheaper respecs.
---
I believe you are highlighting the exact issue I brought up. If your goal in this game (or life) is to leave everyone in the dust for your own benefit, factions and loyalties be damned for your personal benefit.... you might be a shithead
---
Until people have made enough gold and the economy grows. When majority are level 60 and can farm more. Couple of months maybe?
---
I love how LGBT people want to be equals and fight for their rights but then always need everything specially made for them. You LGBTs are just people. Just play on a server with.. people.
---
Only obtainable by digging the dirt mounds with the shovel for the horde(?) quest
---
I'm glad I quit eso before they implemented that then...i liked the story of eso so i dont see how that would be possible if you're bouncing around to random zones.
---
\*Free trade option: 4 stacks of conjured water, and portal at the end (because I had to waste the time explaining how this relationship works).
---
How on earth would we possibly know that?
---
Then they either ice block immediately or blink away and force an intercept, they then ice block and wait out the kick and blink away and poly you now that you have no intercept and no charge.
---
I started in BC as well.  My first character was a hunter, then a druid.  I played that druid (and eventually a shaman) all the way through the return to Draenor.
---
When I leveled I seriously took my time as well.  I think it was a good 3-4 months in before I even started my SFF chain for the first time.  Also, who can forget flying down the mountain when finishing up the Draenei shaman totem chains?
---
I kinda agree it shouldn’t matter what server you roll but I think i get why they’re  looking for more people in their community to play with.
---
I rolled warrior but got pulled away from the game a couple weeks and all my buddies got way ahead of me, resulting in me leveling alone or with pick up groups. I happened to meet another warrior who was chill and we have been leveling and questing together for the past 15 or so levels. We finished The brutal quests together, ran BFD twice to both get strike of the hydra, ran RFK twice to both get Corpsemaker then spent like 6 hours finishing the Whirlwind quest together not to mention PvPing and normal questing. We became bros during this time and now have started sharing more about our lives with one another, we are officially tight and it’s cool to know I got my warrior bro there when I log on.
---
I imagine a scenario where I am LGBTQ and my whole life people have started ignoring or ghosting or criticizing me when I am finally comfortable admitting my true self to them. If my warrior bro did that. Man, I’d be bummed as fuck.
---
I couldn’t imagine living in that fear that if people found out who I really was there is a chance they would just ghost me. I think if I lived in that fear I would look for a community I know is more likely to accept me for me, if the relationships ever got to that point of sharing.
---
Naw OP gotta find his safe space to talk about his sexuality without anyone clashing with it, it's what they do. Just being real.
---
this is way too relatable. especially the     emotes then getting ganked xd i am a forsaken rogue
---
Lok'Tar! For the Horde!
---
This gave me immense satisfaction after that Ally rogue who killed the guy who was AFK using distract
---
Haha no worries I suppose some people assume every post about a PvP exchange is about winners and losers. We just had some fun burning up a dude who kept trying to gank us before work /shrug
---
I gotta ask what level you are though ?
---
You could try whispering Warriors and Druids, that's what I do on my Mage. I've always been able to get a group within 10-15minutes together. DPS is of course, easy to find. For the tank I just do a /who and Type in the search, "Warrior XX-XX(Level Range)" or Druid, and start whispering asking if anyone would like to tank. I usually throw a little compliment in there too like, "Hey \_\_\_\_! We need a big, sexy tank like you to come help us squishies do \_\_\_\_\_\_! Interested? :) " 
---
It's worked out fairly well for me. I used to do it all the time back in Vanilla and it always worked then too.
---
Oh no not right now. Right now broken tooth is by far best pet to have at the moment
---
What gathermate does is records your nodes you’ve “touched” either collected or attempted to collect but were not high enough level too. Then overlays the icons on mini map and main map so you can see where things drop without having to tab out then on your mini map if you’re close enough to see the yellow node it will put a red ring around it so you can see if there’s a node there or not. This data is then combined with multiple players to create an extension that uploads the the data to show all the icons discovered by all players. The minds that worked on that addon discover that the extension data was off compared to retail and private servers. So the data set has to be rediscover by players. 
---
edit. It also works for chests / fishing nodes
---
The new meta blows. This isn't like Vanilla at all.
---
I just meant that other peoples success hurt his value.
---
Hard way to live.
---
In BC, my char got hacked and I was over WoW so I took a break for 3 months. I got the itch to play so I recovered my account and saw that I had epic flying now and max herbalism with bags filled with herbs.
---
Sounds like the start of a Black Mirror episode.
---
People.  What a buncha bastards.
---
Kurinaxx. *Crosses fingers *
---
I’d much rather have a mage doing less dps than an instance featuring multiple wipes and long corpse runs.
---
ITT: OP is a bigot
---
When you aggro Herod 4 myrms spawn in the hallway. If you aren't all inside they will aggro. It's not a bug.
---
We're people, we want to play with people. "Straight" humans aren't people, duh.
---
When should a rogue replace the devilsaur set? 5 piece nightslayer?
---
well what about me? im super serious about raiding but gold would limit me if i spent it like that. im a holy paladin btw maybe u can give me some tips since u think i can make 400g per day.
---
Only asking because drinking twice to buff a group seems like a lot. If we're talking a full mana pool anyways.
---
Swifty videos are lit bro.  Don't you be coming for me right now.
---
Why do you want to look at a tiny screen at a severe angle?
---
Thanks .... I think. I could swear that there weren't big goon guards at the entrance to the main cavern-room, after the left turn out of the elevators, when I first did this. They ARE there now.
---
The mini games are actually the least of retails problems...in fact they are not a problem at all. Pet battles have absolutely no impact on your experience other than existing
---
Biggest fault against imp is that it's damage doesn't scale with +fire, otherwise there would be a case for it(troll build with fire damage stacking).  I guess curse of elements is a minor buff for it, but that's about as far as it goes.  It's really more of a group utility buff with blood pact, and as a budget option when you don't have a soul shard.
---
I have literally never run into that problem. Just buff people at the beginning of the instance and either pay attention to the buffs as the instance goes on, or tell them to let you know when they fall off.
---
You either run with seriously dickish players, or you are making a much bigger deal about it than needs to be done. Either way, you can fix it by communicating with your team and/or adding players to ignore, kicking them, or hearthing out when nothing else works.
---
I also appreciate the completely serious tone everyone has until the Leader breaks when he calculates that they've secured victory and calls for them to "BURN THEM ALL" (essentially). You can hear everyone kinda lighten up after that point and laughing while reveling in their onslaught. It's pretty great. XD
---
Well yeah, orcs are dumber than humans...c'mon
---
Do undead even have a brain?
---
I'm playing Alliance, and yeah I started from 0. Im currently lvl 28. I have a really hectic job so I don't have a lot of time to play.
---
I have a group like this but im starting to get tired of them to be honest.
---
It was fun (at first) having a group to play with consistently, but these guys are starting to get on my nerves with their bad habits. I hate feeling like a nagging parent, but I end up repeating myself a ton. Also they are too comfortable with just randomly going AFK in the middle of a pull, I understand life has circumstances but damn at least say something. /endrant
---
It’s perfectly legal to advertise gold selling. It’s basically capitalism and free markets dark side of the coin. 
---
Personally I don’t care. It’s not affecting me and blizzard makes sure to combat it as much as they can since it is illegal for players to buy gold within the wow game itself, but they also know it’s a never ending fight.
---
I bought gold once back in vanilla. And I might do it again. I have no qualms doing it at least.
---
In Stranglethorn Vale there is a cave area known as the Crystalvein Mine that has level 41-44 basilisks, and these basilisks drop greys worth up to 13s each. You can also skin them for thick and heavy leather. The basilisks spawn very fast and are quite densely packed.
---
Additionally, if you are a miner, there are plenty of iron and mithril node spawns within the cave and surrounding area.
---
There is also a rare spawn within the cave known as Scale Belly that drops the Chromatic Sword. I'm not sure if it's worth a lot in classic because it's only a green, but it has a unique look and is worth ludicrous amounts in retail.
---
Doesn't really help pre-40, but is crazy good gold if you still need gold for your mount post-40, or if you just want to grind and make some gold.
---
might not happen often, but sometimes orher classes might pass or greed. Either way if you’re not sure, i think it’s best to discuss instead of just clicking need
---
Well, yes. Population peaked early and will slowly decline, that was predictable and inevitable. I can't imagine there will be enough new players joining Classic to outnumber those leaving it. Maybe once phase 3 launches, this will change and Classic will get a "revival", since I know a lot of people are waiting after BGs.
---
That said, I doubt any server will be unplayable any time soon, we all knew the hype wouldn't last, but I think an overwhelming majority of players weren't returning to Classic just because of the hype.
---
That always gets me, randomly running into the same person I ran DM with 20 levels later in an SM group, love it!
---
Oh wow! Will definitely look into that addon!
---
Yeah I realize... this however just feels broken. Which is why I am surprised, most blizzard animations are actually quite good. 
---
This is actually breaking alot of basic animation principles... just didn't expect something this bad to have been released
---
Now drop tailoring.
---
charging downhill helps iirc
---
I dont know that, its whats called an opinion. Just wanting to see other peoples opinion on the matter.
---
I think you would like Whitemane
---
50% of the player base is playing Mage. Bound to be a lot of dickheads/bad players.
---
As a mage, when I wear a dagger, will that also increase my damage when using spells even without int stats? I saw a streamer wearing a dagger instead of a staff and I'm wondering why. Can someone please enlighten me with this?
---
This is why I no longer enter in groups someone else starts as a tank, I see a mage and I just want to leave the second I join.
---
Oh that makes sense, I had no idea. What happens after the fight, do they just despawn? I only ever recall a bunch of regular lv 30 dudes coming in after.
---
But they need most of their mana just to use to keep agro, not much for healing themselves
---
I haven't actually bought Shackle Undead so hopefully no one asks me to do that
---
I get a feeling they'll never learn to PoMPyro. That requires two buttons other than Blizzard.
---
Kiting requires doing something other than standing and channelling Blizzard.
---
Nah don't worry she is actually a spider. Blizz just borrowing anime logic.
---
I should think 56 is just fine to full clear BRD.
---
Once again, we witness one of these heroic deeds and can see a well-equipped level 60 heroically knocking down a probably ill-equipped level 53 in the middle of the fight against a monster. A true hero who probably steals the lollipops in real life small children.
---
mining and engineering
---
I hope Blizzard has been paying attention to how Jagex handles osrs. The community involvement is the thing that has allowed osrs to overtake the "retail" version of the game. 
---
Polling the playerbase to figure out which direction classic wow should go is the best future we can hope for.
---
It annoys me more, personally. I have to rez, and feed. Usually in the open. Drink for mana.
---
I find it more *annoying* than being killed.
---
Cross faction trading like that is bannable. It's common knowledge. Just do it till you get banned.
---
Warlocks and shamans are for sure strong vs a mage but high skilled mages just have so many tools.
---
At lvl 30, venruki beat snutz in a multiple round 1v1 tourny.
---
At lvl 60 with gear mages have so much burst damage with the right spec that they can simply burst locks, use 2x iceblocks to remove all dots and get the 2x coc shatters with cold snap. Its not exactly an ez win for a warlock. And they can always reset with poly.
---
I'm not sure what the hell your referencing. Maybe you're poor after purchasing the mount? But abused animals should never be used as a type of comical representation of your in game issues and should definitely not be tagged as Humor.
---
Name checks out
---
Should have made it NSFW
---
In town I'd generally do like a gold and a half for 40 water, but in a group it's free, period. You joined a group with a common goal and everyone does their part, making water is a large part of yours, is free, and you can do it while everyone is buffing up quite easily. Make more next time everyone is buffing etc. It's not hard or even that time consuming. So many mages act like it's the greatest inconvenience in their life.
---
What will be the best profession for an alt Hunter focusing mainly on Solo grind/PVE? 
---
Main is currently max Herb/Tailoring.
---
Sorry I meant I almost always die at lava jumps, at the final stretch.
---
Mines a bit lower than that even, lvl 20 SFK wolf. I think that's a good idea though! Thanks!
---
I got it off a couple of times during vanilla but as already mentioned, it was buggy and inconistent.
---
Play both to 15. By then you will have found your favourite.
---
There, no video needed.
---
Found the mage who blames tank when he pulls aggro
---
Look up videos of unreleased vanilla content on YouTube. Super interesting and a lot of it is close to finished
---
There are only 2 1.2 attack speed wolves in the game. Wolfs are the PVE pet to use. So you generally end up having a wolf out with you most of the time.
---
Actually you may want a Paladin to pull with a bubble and provide oh shit heals/bubbles.
---
But your penis is bigger in t2
---
This is probably the funniest post I've seen all day.  Thank you.
---
Damn I be been giving a gold and a half Everytime since I got my mount.
---
You think I don’t do that already? The people who need on items they don’t need to use are people who don’t understand their role..
---
Most of the issues people complain about with retail are due to playerbase fragmentation which is a symptom of vertical progression. Currently they fixed frag on retail between xpacs by allowing players to skip them. They previously tried to address it with LFG to make putting a group together easier in the older content. They introduced LFR so that casual players weren’t separated from the raiders and so they weren’t making content 90% of the playerbase would never see. They introduced phasing and then the cataclysm to create more immersive quests that would be more enjoyable to do solo in an empty zone. Dailies are a way to force everyone into the same zones. And so forth. One big theme overall is that they’ve slowly made the game rely less on social interactions, not arbitrarily but because they felt it was a necessity. They can add new dungeons, quests and zones but if they go with vertical progression we will eventually be right back where we started.
---
I have limited spellcleave experience but every group I ever did had three mages, a priest and a lock.
---
Sure, people are quitting because the hypes died down.  But the population on most servers is still quite strong (wasnt it just last Friday night where every US PVP server was High population?) and it leads me to believe that it should be fine for the majority of servers.
---
I really think that people are underestimating the amount of people who came back to WoW just to play classic.  Myself included, they should help bolster any of the quitters or people who find retail more enjoyable.
---
Multishot + immediately Feign Death to wipe the aggro. EZ
---
I think that's the spy classic addon
---
I thought this was a joke about having Shadow Affinity in the priest talent tree.
---
They had limited realm transfers to lower pop or newly created realms.  They are likely to include realm transfers at some point, but you may not be eligible for a transfer depending on the requirements.  You may have to lose all progress on your character and start over.  Or you can just tough it out with the queues and unfavorable pvp of being the controlling faction.  https://wowpop.appspot.com/  only one realm has a perfect balance, so you would be going from your realm to a controlling faction, or an oppressed faction on 95% of the wow classic realms no matter where you move.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning
---
Its an effective trolling tactic.
---
Oh so you want the wolf for raiding and want the highest attack speed for that wolf
---
Wouldnt it say you've seen two on the ah then? It says 1.
---
You seem to have a different  version of auctioneer thanni have. I see much more ah  info
---
If you're going to be dual wielding, there's nothing more optimal than that spec if you're going for highest DPS possible. Only change I ever make is if I know there will be other warriors who will have 5/5 imp BS in my raid group that will be keeping it up, I usually like to take 1 point out of that and put it in piercing howl for some utility. Really helps if you're ever caught out in world pvp and it has some limited use in raids/dungeons as well.
---
&gt;grp'ing
---
hahahahha
---
uggggh i'm skipping the gym tonight
---
I feel like epic mount isn't everyones top priority once hitting 60.
---
I use shift w for poly, easy transition from running to poly, could be used for warr charge or whatever else.
---
You had bad luck.
---
I am a straight white male, and I would likely not want to be in those guilds either. I don't need to go out and find a straight white male refuge to avoid them though.
---
Keep leveling/questing you will get the gold soon enough
---
sometimes a zone won't have enough quests to take a character straight from the min zone level to max zone level. If the quests in the zone are orange, it's time to look for quests in another zone. sometimes there will be quests in your current zone that send you to a zone with a similar level range.
---
Haven't had to sit in a queue for awhile, and I'm in one of the more higher-populated servers. So to answer your question, yes, it is dropping. Populations always drop after the initial release when everyone is pouring in. I don't think that means Classic is going to die, though. I know you never mentioned that, but that's obviously the next logical thought with population drop.
---
I play WoW for the social aspect. Is it worth trying to play on a rp server for the first time?
---
I'll have to look again. Didn't notice the silver...  
---
As a Shaman the underwater stuff isn't so bad. I'm no seal but water breathing is good enough.
---
why?
---
Was having this issue a couple days ago updatedy router and modem firmware been working fine ever since.
---
i did absolutely nothing...
---
Meaningful cutoff will happen tonight. I bought my  1 month playtime on release day, and it's ending today. I've played a lot daily (lev60 with pre-raid bis gear), but I mean to quit and not buy more time. How many people are there like me, who knows.
---
No matter what, the 1 month buyers will cause slight dent today, but considering majority of the players haven't made it to 60, it's probably not a noticeable bump. It's probably the biggest daily dent there'll be in the first 3 months. Another reason why subs might start dropping faster is when big enough population feel like there's no enough content in game. So if next phase takes 6 months, there'll probably be a bit of yoyo effect where people cancel sub between phases and re-sub for a month or so for every phase.  The same that happens in grander scale when new wow expansions come, or in smaller scale when diablo3/poe/etc. games have new seasons.
---
I play on Faeralina (US), you would have seen Echeyakee get killed, then you ganked and your body camped. Not all servers are the same, even PvP. Hell, if you took rez sickness, someone would have probably killed you at GY.
---
Usually a minute or so less than the spawn I think so like 13/14 mins prob
---
Nice, That is good to hear! Didn't know how it was working alongside CC, ranged weapon procs are breaking scatter shot, but I think that was actually how it was working in vanilla.
---
Not wolves, that's the point.
---
I guess I should have written /s in my comment.
---
Correct.
---
If you want to get honored with thunder bluff for the mount, you could just Rez hop all the way to mulgore and do the starting zone with him. You will really not get any rep with UC but it's w.e.. I've leveled so many characters, that I just go to what ever starting zone I like best. You can def walk a level 1 anywhere.
---
As if killing lowbies wasnt low enough, some people will kill fishermen?
---
Same!!  I'm reading his post and thinking to myself..."Wow, I haven't experienced that".
---
Swamp of Sorrows has a Murloc area near the coast on the bottom right corner of the map. Good gold farming spot to hit!
---
Can you elaborate for those of us who have no idea what you're talking about
---
Oh, I'll show you some ropes.
---
Also when you're running, shift doesnt automatically use the shift w keybind, you have to stop running in order to use the shift w bind.
---
Ideal for notes and guides, or music player etc. Theres a million things you can do with more visible space.
---
Who then becomes the best pvp class when paired with a healer. Which in BGs isn't exactly uncommon.
---
Hunters, Druids and Shamans have AoE but they aren't wanted for a "spellcleave" group which means mages/locks. Hence why terms are coined to establish a meta.
---
Just keep leveling / questing / dungeoning how you normally would and you'll have the gold before lvl 42.
---
Engineering, and then herb or enchanting depending on whether you want to run mara or DM:T. 
---
Engineering is mandatory for DM:T while enchanting is optional, herb is nice to have if you’re farming maraudon.
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
Apes has a few more tricks up their sleeves. Dont count em out
---
I'd like something similar for the sound the bird pets make with their wings.
---
Blizzard be like
---
Is this a predictable cone?
---
Ehhhh, warriors can just be dps in PvE and PvP just fine. Being a tank end game has its own benefits (go look at lfg chat) and should a high cost should be paid to get both those benefits and being one of the better PvP classes. Shaman have the same thing if they want to heal PvE and be WF build in PvP. (Just addressing the PvP to PvE reclass here.) I really cant think of anything that seperates warriors from other classes in terms of PvP to PvE reclasses and the "need" to do so.
---
...
---
THE scepter ... for AQ
---
How? I'm playing bear and I keep aggro well with swipe, are you just grouping them up, letting mage pull, then popping out of bear?
---
Thanks for that link. Hopefully I can reconnect.
---
Eh, this attempt doesn't really work too well, sorry.
---
Blood and Thunder well played friend
---
Always kill the pet first. And if possible let the hunter res the pet so you can kill it again.
---
Sure, people are usually more interactive on RP realms
---
Depends on what kind of social aspect you mean.
---
If you want to roleplay, sure, an RP server should work fine.
---
If you just want to talk to people while you grind, just pick a high pop server in your geographical area.
---
haha, ok. Definitely worthy of a "huntard" style nickname.
---
A lot of classes have AoE but spellcleave means they want mages and maybe a lock.
---
Yup, as a tank applying for a BC raiding guild I actually had an interview. Guild leader had 5 of his raid team and myself do a 6man kara. Me being undergeared, my job was to not let em pull off me. Was blown away to watch a 6man kara when guilds at the time were wiping countless times with a full group. I managed to keep em all alive and got an invite after. Followed promptly with a 2 week trial.
---
Good times. While it was a process, little did I know I would be joining the guild to get most server firsts throughout BC expansion! Miss you TRS- SilverHand !
---
Because you're coming to a subreddit with a technical problem and your computer specifications are 'Mac'.
---
It's hilarious.  As if anyone would be able to gauge anything from this madness.
---
Considering what people pay for Edgemasters Handguards, i feel that i got off pretty cheap.
---
I dunno. Bloodsail has been pretty consistent from my experiences.
---
Hahaha, For the Horde!
---
Why not both?
---
Paladin.
---
Failure to communicate? Get real. The tank should have the tiniest bit of awareness necessary to see when the healer has no mana and is drinking. If he can’t do that then he shouldn’t be tanking at all. It’s laughable that you would even try to defend this.
---
You don’t have to, but people seek out groups of people who are like them all the time. It’s only natural to want to socialize/game with people you know you’re going to get along with.  🤷🏻‍♀️
---
cool grinder yo
---
I’ve read the road as it was assigned for one of my college classes way back when. That book was a fucking gut punch. Really good though
---
Go elemental at 40. So much better.
---
Why goblin over gnomish?
---
I do, that warrior was fucking terrible.    Not even an intercept?   it wasn't on CD at that point
---
What's wrong with darkshore? I'd take it over fucking westfall and loch modan any day of the week
---
Boom.
---
Ah thanks, I didn't play vanilla.
---
same 
---
today I logged in and immediately got whispered last spot for BRD
---
and Im a fucking rogue lol
---
imagine having to /who for rogues
---
its probably a common issue now cuz groups are stacked with mages so they gotta balance it for loot chances
---
mine had 2 mages
---
Not really right at all. Rogue are really annoying/difficult to play early on leveling, hunters are pretty good early on in pvp, not that you would be doing a tone of pvp early on though. People tend to think of the top 5% of fun when thinking about playing a rogue (the few moments you'll spend stealthing around enemies mob grinding etc), and the actual 95% of your time you'll be spending in game slips your mind, pve on a rogue is awful imo. Yeah if you build talents right and gear right you can actually be really efficient, but its just not fun.  Hunters on the other hand are really easy to level, not the best dps in dungeons but not the worst.
---
Some horde players make me with undead was a separate faction and I could just kill everyone aside from my other spooky bois.
---
This guy ganks.
---
I mean the price certainly isn't going to go down. Once everybody has been at level 60 long enough to have enough money to want to spend on companions and there aren't a large number of people leveling alts there will be less and the market value of all goods should be higher.
---
Blood meridian is on my short list of books to read next.
---
I thought classic dungeons were going to be hard. I miss having to CC carefully and having to take things slow. That was a big reason I was excited for classic. Not that I'm having a bad time, but when we easily faceroll every dungeon with aoe spam, it makes me disappointed. It feels like we're just cheesing our way to 60
---
Why not bootcamp?
---
Found the mage.
---
I did the same, had no issue getting mount at 40. Don't buy skills after 35, buy them after you get your mount. I'm also a rogue so i pickpocketed everything as well.
---
you are so cool
---
Elemental earth are creeping In price due to more guilds obtaining the sharpening stone recipe so on my server they're ranging from 40-55s at the moment. Could farm all the rock elementals in badlands or arathi.
---
But I think as a mage just find an area with good density to aoe grind. You get way more g/hour in just vendor trash than going for AH selling unless you happen to get super lucky.
---
If you get killed you have to do the same things and add a 5 min run.
---
No 400g really isnt bad for a BIS item.
---
You will get a quest for a 2h mace called Verigans first at 20. Look it up.
---
This is propaganda, there are just as many fuckos on alliance.
---
Some random ally mage asked me if i wanted water while i was out grinding and i said yeah, and then he gave me water i couldnt even use yet. 
---
He came back a min later and gave me the right water, but still geez, what a troll amiright
---
Not bannable which is why I intend on putting up a tent in Stonetalon and Hillsbrad when I'm not raiding or doing dungeons
---
Thunderfury :(
---
The tanks who reserve all orbs in strat live are laughable. I got pre bis on rshaman and an epic mount and cba to run anything else. Already got a war to 41 so enjoying that.
---
Oh god you kind of made me interested in the rppvp.
---
The cash grab is revolving around keeping players playing.
---
The best way to do it, is to add things to keep people playing.
---
The business model of live is to milk people for every micro transaction possible.
---
There was no forums for the new split realms and that was the sole reason I didn’t transfer. Pretty much guaranteeing that the server is dead.
---
I will weigh in. Its historically been a challenge for me to find a raid group. Something that requires Comms. Now i present a certail, female, way. But my voice totally betrays that, and talking alone isnt the issue. It starts small with stuff like "Oh i thought you were a chick" and it devolves quickly Most times despite explaining thinga to Raid Leads and other members i get treated differently when my voice is heard, mostly like i liar or a fake. I just try to find lgbt guilds to avoid these accusations in the future. Thats not to say i HAVENT found good people, i have! But at this point i risk wasting time since most treat me in that "Liar" way
---
I literally logged into [battle.net](https://battle.net) to double check today lol
---
You can just put a backslash before the pound sign btw.
---
\#hi
---
This is why I now specify that I am a Fire Mage when trying to find a group.
---
I'm 47 and see a decent amount of people in Hinterlands.
---
https://youtu.be/iKTqL96zn2I
---
Nothing to pity here, friend, but thank you.
---
i might do it too, i think i have enough mats from mining. what should i make sure to get from gnomish before switching
---
I never really played classic back in the day and I'm kindof an idiot, when is it safe for me to aoe and when shouldn't I aoe on my mage?
---
As a mage i can confirm, its what we do.
---
Except our sheeps. NO ONE TOUCH THEM.
---
Get out of holy tree ASAP, go to your trainer and respec. It is an endgame spec. You can level with it by all means, but Paladin is a slow class and going Holy is pretty much torture.
---
Retribution is the spec you want. Hard hitting, able to heal but can dish out damage as well as take it. And you can still heal dungeons fine, not at level 60, but until then you're good.

Focus on strength and stamina.

Not that stressful anymore, he had to take breaks when he first started eye tracking, but now he never has any strain or stress.
---
Thats the result of flawed pvp honor system making  it most lucrative honor to farm lowbies in the world. Dont hate the players, hate the game.
---
They need max honor to hit R14. They dont care about your feelings lol.
---
Damn I wonder what I did to be put on my server's kill on sight lists.
---
&gt;expensive as all hell
---
I mean as much as it sucks that's the answer.
---
People would have liked it a lot more.   But not a lot more people would have gone to see it.
---
I agree but elemental is so boring sometimes. Your literally using lighting bolt the entire times unless your free mana cast procs or if your no mana insta crit is off cool down.
---
Forgot the terms for these but you know what I mean.
---
I was around there at 30. Make sure you hit the AH, make a bank alt for easy access to AH as well
---
It's a complete pain in the ass to get a low level pet leveled up by kiting mobs when you don't have the gear to kill them as they run to you. Seriously takes forever. Killing ranged mobs is a pretty solid idea but yeah, running dungeons with it is a better idea.
---
*is corn grass?*
---
Am I not allowed to be proud of my sexuality?
---
I think you should spec into a dps instead of holy and have cloth gear to switch to when healing for groups. If you wanna heal late game respec into holy. Speccing for dps will make your solo content much easier and for the early level dungeons being specced in holy is unnecessary. I'm not a pally btw but this is the general rule of thumb for healing
---
I don't really see the comparison. The reason I mention Dota is because of the leadership/shot calling appeal of this clip, which Dota has abundantly.
---
It’s not intended to be a brief video, it’s a detailed discussion and I wanted to establish whether you should even watch the video or not. If you are a returning player, there’s no point watching what I’m about to discuss.
---
But regardless, thanks for the feedback.
---
i regret asking u for advice. pce
---
I was doing that slaughter quest in dark shore when these other two comedians joined to do the same quest, amI then said what’s up clone and to my amazement they said the exact same thing back, and through the 2-3 hour in darkshore I kept bumping into them it was great!
---
That’s icehouse classic. Just being in random social situations and somebody actually pooping to you
---
Makes sense now. Arcane get ya through tho?
---
People are also forgetting that the gear itemization was different then.  There is so much spell damage gear now that wasn’t available pre DM when MC was really the only option for it.
---
I run 0/5/46 and I won't be changing any time soon.  You lose way too much as 20/0/31.  I can't even get everything I want in 46 points.
---
Comparing a group of people who still get harassment and persecution to this day with people with red hair is shallow.
---
Dont be a jabroni
---
Considering it. But I havent decided on a new one. Probably Alchemy for cheaper pots.

He has nonverbal spastic Cerebral Palsy. Basically his mind and body are separate entities. We explain in more detail on our channel :D

With Improved Shield block talent they can block 4 attacks. . every 5 seconds.

It’s not abused, it’s actually diseased. The reference to was the Forsaken mount. But ya I hear ya and your right, but I couldn’t resist.
---
MCP is bis for bear and cat. The idea is warriors are better at mitigation than ferals while bears are best at threat generation. So why min/max mitigation when you're never going to outclass a warrior in that area?
---
The big niche feral has where warriors are clearly less competive is threat generation. MCP basically guarantees double threat output over a warrior and it's what enables the entire spec. It's not a bad idea to wear Warden Staff as feral a lot of times, when you're tanking raid trash that get focused down last you might as well stack mitigation for instance but MCP is still best in slot, without it bear is almost mediocre.
---
No that's base I believe.  Only priests can wear this robe, and since its BoP you have to craft it yourself as well.  There's a mage and warlock robe that are similar patterns, but the warlock robe is pretty bad in comparison to the priest and mage one.
---
Some people may want more of an explanation than that, that’s the purpose of the video. Plus it shows some gameplay for someone who may know nothing about WoW
---
Yeah, with some good AOE DPS for the Lyceum and a solid understanding with everyone to keep moving, you should be okay. 
---
The last boss might give some issues with threat from growl resists et al, but you'll be okay.  Emp is a pretty easy tank and spank.
---
&gt; i get why they’re looking for more people in their community to play with.
---
Isn't "the community" people who are playing the game?
---
&gt; I couldn’t imagine living in that fear that if people found out who I really was there is a chance they would just ghost me.
---
I'd be happy not to have to interact with people who would do that.  But that's not everyone on every server. That's not reason enough to go looking for a safe place.
---
They should have done some type of balancing. Made it lock out one faction if they got over 55% of the pop
---
Hope you enjoy aetish, you'll still run into people like those in the comments here but it should still be quite welcoming. They have a discord ( [https://discord.gg/jd8BBzy](https://discord.gg/jd8BBzy)) if you want to look around there first
---
Not even 5 level 60 Rogues could kill her.
---
Couldn't care less* 
---
If you *could* care less, you clearly care somewhat.
---
I really think you're missing the point. What I was saying is that IF you enjoy the strategy/leadership/shot calling vibe of this video, THEN there is a lot of that to be found in Dota. OG is a great example of a team all working together to make plays like this, resulting in stomps. 
---
At no point did I say that the sheer numbers will be found in Dota, I ruled that out in my first post. You are the one asking for that criteria to be met, which is an impossibility. Referencing EE's twitch stream is even less of an equal comparison.
---
Well if it's anything like the guild point system you have two options. 
---
1) Embrace douchehood and make friends with some people doing it, suddenly you are getting ALL of the loot. 
---
2) Go find a guild or friends.
---
I leveled as Holy/Disc actually. I made pretty much all my money just by quests and doing instances up to 60, so it didnt even feel like a grind at all.
---
Funny, this reminded me of a similarly placed vein in Loch Modan during the 4.0 Cataclysm prepatch. Ended up teleporting me to the Bastion of Twilight entrance portal on that suspended island (again, this was BEFORE Cataclysm launch). That was the coolest thing ever.
---
That's when you setup this bad boy to change your direction.  Clip W key down and put this [birb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iapECJKx4k0) on a strafe key.

(I'm not actually endorsing this but yes people have used it).
---
Soon as I got my ww axe I had a friend put a chain on it instantly lol. Doing the same with my executioners axe once I can use it at 44

Taurens are cool, but Native Americans were generally engaged in constant inter-tribal warfare. The idea of noble, peaceful savages are fantasy trope that doesn't really translate to real life.

A GM will not help you if you get scammed, their job is strictly to deal with issues related to game mechanics (e.g. items lost in the mail, getting stuck in geometry, stopping people from killing players in cities where guards can’t intercept them). Social interactions that otherwise respect the mechanics of the game are not policed by GMs. 
---
That is, that’s what it was like the last time I got scammed which was back in vanilla. Blizzard’s policies may have changed since then, but I wouldn’t know.
---
No matter how you make money, it's faster to make it with your epic mount. So it's the best initial investment.
---
MC content is so easy that having this single upgraded piece vs. having something that helps your character specifically in all aspects of the game it's kind of a no-brainer. Especially when the Baron chest is still really strong.
---
The truefaith was my second major purchase though.
---
I don't agree with melaspike, don't waste your hard earned combo points on a kidney shot just to bandage. If you can't blind, then use gouge and you'll at least get a few ticks of bandage in. Sword spec is definitely something you want ASAP, and if your spec is really messed up it might be worth spending money for a respec. Look at guides online, I tend to use icy veins website the most.  
---
As combat you'll just be opening with CS then spamming SS to evis. SnD if enemies are tightly packed, or you pulled multiple mobs, or you're fighting tougher enemies - basically just if you can use it to its duration.  
---
For macros it's personal preference. I like sneaking around so I have a pick pocket/CS macro and a pick pocket/ambush macro (I'm subtlety). Most macros are things you can easily do yourself and I find rogue doesn't need macro's as much as classes like hunter/warlock/warrior.
---
your words: "dark period", "downwards spiral"... I understand that there's a wonderful rush to being totally absorbed by something, and that may be fine to live for a while. But it seems like a part of you knows it isn't all ok, if only because you'll have to return to real life eventually and the more you let yourself go down the spiral the more painful that return will be. I wish you well.
---
You know things are wrong when Hunters are not the "dumb player" class anymore.
---
My raiding spot as a Hunter, brought to you by Jokerd and a billion spellcleave mages.
---
Annnnnd that's where it ends.
---
The cost also includes mats. The recipe was 140g.
---
Found the triggered mage ITT
---
If you’re a warlock necrosis shows dot timers and other useful warlock tools
---
Do your job and hold aggro and AoE isn’t a problem.
---
Yes, if you took a 1h+shield vs 2h tanking with equal deaths. The 2h would likely have a higher repair bill.
---
If you keep playing, vendoring bad greens and quest items, and not spending on unnecessary things you should be around 400-500 at 60. Maybe 300 or 350 if you have REALLY bad luck.
---
&gt; As fun as this undoubtedly was for them
---
Uhhhh why are you playing the game?
---
Apparently, some people *really* can't play a video game with people who are different than they are.
---
I think that perception is overblown as well. Sure hunters do fall off in dps in the super late game but that's still several phases away and a naxx raid is still taking a geared hunter over a fresh 60 mage in blues every day of the week. In my MC group yesterday 3 of the top 6 dps were the only 3 hunters in the group (cleared 8/10 doing Domo and rag today). Mages of course had to decurse so it's skewed a bit because of that.
---
That's frankly ridiculous.
---
All I can think of is hers is "30 days" and your is "1 month" august had 31 days in it so 30 days in the 26th no?
---
This is basically a 1v1 for the mage I don't understand. Be proud you won and didn't die again.
---
Fair, I just think you lose some utility in the event something goes wrong.
---
For 1v1 pvp? No question about it, warlock is flat out better. It’s probably the best dueling class if Spec’d right. 
---
For group pvp? It depends, but mage likely had the edge in most compositions.
---
How did you cloak yourself?
---
It's like playing Dark Souls on like Iron Man then saying you know what, I could use more of a challenge.
---
Nobody wants to hear you shouting and mouth breathing into a microphone. Sheesh.
---
Warlock hands down.
---
I can't remember the name... But the one NE of thousand needles.
---
Would a wand that deals shadow damage proc Shadow Weaving?
---
Absolutely, do it. I don't even RP and I think RP servers are the best. More player-created content and the world feels more alive.
---
Me AM that kind of orc
---
Heyooooo
---
That's because Truefaith can only be used by priests, just like Robe of the Archmage is mage exclusive and Void is for Warlocks.
---
That only works with a warlock's Imp
---
Can't, sadly. Not until BC, I think.
---
This post and the guy who is making mock up zones are kinda making me change my mind about classic plus vs tbc/wrath.
---
May want classic plus more lol
---
It definitely was. Saw it all the time, and it was fine, and still is lol.

It's your census addon. Read blue posts, you cant query like that anymore

Isnt the [nomod] function a necessity?

Drain tank warlocks don't really need first aid. Granted I'd still get FA because it's clutch sometimes, but one could easily skip it.
---
Yeah, I was Alliance for a while through BC to MoP and forgot how ridiculous the quest line is. 
---
Enjoy!  Makes you really feel like you earned it.
---
Haha I'm definitely trying to limit my game time because it's so easy to get lost in the world!

Either that Rogue is PVE Combat or everything they had was on CD. It won't always be that easy.

Horde&gt; Got a group in Feralas to do the chicken escort.  Everyone ready?  yep! So i start it up, no one got it.. did you have the egg?  You need an egg?? nvm bye, they left me.
---
This human war saw me and started helping me out.  Got all the way to almost the end with the 4 gnolls and a herpderp shaman rolls in; kills JUST the warrior leaves me to die failing the quest.
---
I second this. The downside of not being drain tank spec for questing outweighs every advantage you get elsewhere. Aslong as you are questing stick to draintank. At lvl 55+ when you start farming pre BiS you can respec, the most versitile spec to go would be SM/Ruin.
---
ah ok, thanks for the correction.
---
That's sick and something I can't wait to try.

Probably a popular opinion honestly but I want thottbot back

How do you get the poly off if he's swinging at your face and you can't snare him? Just wait out the pushback?
---
Nobody talks about arcane despite the fact its the meta spec for raiding.
---
31/0/20 and you still use frostbolt a lot. You just dont have any extra aoe damage and slow with blizzard. The trade off is less downtime for mana and utility. Some versions even allocate 2 points early for wand spec for even more efficiency.
---
Leveling wise I dont really know how well it does though but in theory it shouldnt be any worse for single target damage and wont oom you as often as fire if you really dont want to do single target frost.
---
I sort of agree, but even then it's not very much trust.
---
I've never used that. Please tell me it kills your character.
---
\*sinister undead laugh\*

Part-time worker life. Having 8+ hours free to play every day.

Do you like mage or lock more?

Yuuuuup. Except that paladin that needed on my cruel barb.
---
More Mana more deeps!
---
first time you respac is 1 g. than every time go higher to max 50g. but every week that you dont respac go 5g down to min 1g again. correct if im wrong.
---
imo. play what you like to play. dont look for others.  be fire if you like to be.
---
Just pve. Sometimes it's annoying to have mobs stunned when trying to get rage. Just wondering if rogues can open with ss/garrote or if cheapshot is actually optimal. Also had some rogues get angry I didn't let them restealth in-between pulls.
---
I'm looking at gear to use in dungeons while leveling.
---
&gt; You're also completely avoiding talents, MP5, and ignoring mana; all of which are extremely important in this discussion. 
---
Talents, MP5, and mana don't actually contribute to a comparison of spirit vs mp5.  If your goal is to end a boss fight with 0 mana, maybe.  The talent taken into consideration is Meditation, for 15% regen of spirit while casting.  MP5 from gear doesn't move the needle in either direction when comparing spirit vs spell power.  It equally applies to both.  Total mana, as in how much you have in any given moment does matter.  But the times you regen to full during a fight are almost nil.  Knowing that you can't reach the break point for spell power with your current mana pool is information that helps drive your gear selection.
---
&gt;Looking at a *single* spell, not taking into account level, is not a great baseline. 
---
Account level is irrelevant as the spreadsheet is agnostic to it.  Adjusting the values for your character and the spell you are looking to analyze is what matters.
---
I really like your advice about the scroll wheel macro, and that's something I'll definitely be doing since I have a free-scrolling mouse.
---
However, there's sooo much information missing from your video that would make it much more complete. Firstly, there are six devilsaur spawns, not three. This picture shows all of their spawn locations and their paths. If your server isn't too populated at the time, it's worth it to run through some of the paths looking for Devilsaurs just in case no one has killed them yet.
---
https://i.gyazo.com/f415abfbb5dbb3cb554beed0865a52cf.jpg
---
Secondly are the spawn timers. Learning how to track the Devilsaur spawns (like with a stopwatch/timer site on a 2nd monitor) is so so helpful. All of the Devilsaurs (except for the NW spawn on the map) are on a 13-17 minute spawn timer. This means that once the Devilsaur dies, it will respawn AT LEAST 13 minutes later, or AT MOST 17 minutes later. For the NW Devilsaur, the timer is 9-11 minutes.
---
Now I feel like a saint. I have buffed everyone I’ve seen and offered water and food at every inn I’ve been to. People have been very appreciative.
---
No, I complained about people pulling before I had a chance to drink, after just buffing the whole group. 
---
Sure you can read, but what's it worth if you can't understand what you're reading. You're sitting here arguing with an idea you imagined up.
---
Hell yeah, diablo 2 javazon in wow
---
Targets 15 defense levels higher than your weapon skill will require 9% hit chance to cap, 10 defense levels higher than your weapon skill requires only 6%. This is because 1% of your hit is ignored against targets 15 defense levels higher than your weapon skill. This makes weapon skill invariably the most valuable stat for any class that swings a weapon.
---
Defense is useless for a bear, you can't come anywhere close to a decent amount, and unlike warriors/paladins, druid only gets dodge from it (since we can't block/parry)
---
Warden Staff is BIS because of the armor, nothing else.
---
Where the hell do you guys find these people? Lmao. Most of my interactions with others have ranged from neutral to very wholesome.
---
I suppose it makes more sense for static casting, but you won't be able to bind any of your instant casts to a shift-keybind and use them while running forwards.
---
Just get in Deadmines and roll Need on everything.  If you can equip it, it's Hunter gear.
---
Why are mages the only ones that find exp farming exploits? They already level faster than other classes using non-exploitative methods!
---
i'm actually leaning priest and leveling primarily through dungeons.  Mostly because I've played a lot of shaman already on TBC and WotLK private servers.
---
Dont worry, I leveled a pally first back in vanilla and did the same exact thing! 
---
Yeah basically level as ret. You can still heal fine if you hold onto some intellect gear!
---
As a mage a tip maybe everyonce in a while for water would be nice.
---
Like we're talking one buff and keep going. From a full pool you really think 975 is a lot ?
---
Thanks, now I've just dropped a full-on belly laugh in an otherwise quiet dentist's waiting room and people are staring.
---
Take your upvote and get out.
---
here is a hint. it dose not need to be tested, it's there and that is that.
---
Honestly though, as a healer nothing is worse than a warlock with 60% mana, 100% health, both regrowth and rejuv ticking and NOT lifetapping. Like wtf dude, stop casting shadowbolt and lifetap already.
---
On a sidenote, I have no problems with warlocks lifetapping all the time. I will heal them when I can/it isn't a waste, and else I just ignore it
---
Yup on stalag I got 60 r.sham, like 95% pre bis and just raid log on it now. Got a warrior to 41 now and I'm really enjoying it. Really just want this toon setup for p2 for dm east farming. Shaman has herbing for all the gromsblood and war has mining for the rich thorium so plenty of gold to be made.
---
Already got my epic mount, 400g liquid, 10 or so lotus and already got like 300 elemental earth stocked for AQ patch.
---
I remember killing the quest npcs at the undead starting area und low levelers at Northdale. There have been always people who created an alliance and got really upset. I kept doing this for several hours each day (lmfao) cause it was just too funny
---
Hey all,
---
I managed to snag a https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13043/blade-of-the-titans for 6g on the AH, but after further inspection I realize it may be worse than my https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6975/whirlwind-axe
---
I’m thinking this because my Whirlwind Axe has:
---
+5 axe weapon skill specialization (I’m an orc)
---
+5% crit chance (axe specialization talent)
---
But Blade of the Titans has:
---
~6.25dps more than WW axe (after adding in the 7 strength to 1.0 dps)
---
+140 hp than WW axe
---
Can someone tell me which ones better? And if there’s a suggestion as to what I should get next for my weapon. Level 44 orc warrior
---
I actually had a guy offer me a gold (which I declined of course) because I was using so many reagents to give the group prayer of fort (was a full clear brd run, I think I probably used 12 or so overall.
---
Honestly the chillest dungeon run all expansion. We wiped a few times and ran back or I rezzed us thanks to soulstone. Mage was constantly tossing water to us casters, dps were waiting to make sure tank had threat, and since we were under leveled for last boss we actually kited him as a group which was a lot of fun letting dots tickle him down while ran from side to side jumping off when he got close.
---
ur not most wanted ur actually jus a trash rogue
---
Your basically pulling a king solomon on them though.
---
That private server had honour system at launch though.  There was literally an incentive to gank as many people as possible while leveling up due to rank3 giving another 10g discount on your level 40 mount.
---
The area to the south of silverpine forest is Gilneas. If you go to the border there is a giant wall guarded by humans. I never knew this was there until recently. It means blizzard had plans for this area all along, which I find quite interesting.
---
There's at least one addon that silences all other sounds when you're fishing. Another thing you can do is just find the .ogg and replace it with something else.
---
Pve has its drawbacks too, the nice part of pvp is that once you clear an area there's a lot less competition on tags/less waiting. Someone steals your tag? Kill em, ez.
---
Are you a hunter on Whitemane?

Jealousy on the internet knows no bounds
---
thats weird, i was in exact same situation last night, in hillsbrad with aoe mages in every field. I learned the fun way the responsibility a 0 cooldown 10 second fear gives a person.
---
You don't use MCPs all the time, you only use them when you absolutely need that early snap threat. A bear with MCP puts out even more threat than a dual wield tank, considering equal gear levels.
---
But really, you should never have a bear MT unless you're absolutely desperate. Warriors are still better for tanking raid bosses.
---
Can't you just replace the .ogg of the gunshot?
---
Loser
---
So is my heart.

Same here. That's probably a factor in why I don't have a mount yet.
---
I do the accents months later when someone just makes a character to save the name. I have 2 characters. My main and a bank alt.
---
What about your tooltip addon?
---
What is your metric for that?  
---
Because the numbers, even adjusted for inflation, says your analogy is wrong.  
---
Retail wow lost 80% of its player base, the new Star Wars are as popular as the originals, by the numbers.
---
As a mage who tried aoe grinding for a while before I got bored, I can confirm that those work.
---
Lock can solo Mara and DM once it comes out
---
Nothing is wrong with it. Imo Human is the only Alliance race because the other 3 just look like shit.
---
They ruin it for themselves. They will have no one to run dungeons with
---
It was a classic wow pvp playlist lol
---
Underrated comment
---
Lol not sure how well that would’ve gone
---
Running doesnt make a difference, shift does not automatically use the shift w keybind when running. You have to stop and use the keybind for it to work, my frost nova is bound to shift E and arcane explosion to shift q, I run and use both of these often at the same time.
---
Your other option you neglect is Garotte
---
And correct me if Im wrong but doesnt Garotte silence the target? at least it should at higher levels. 
---
Cheap shot is for the stun and combo points, Garotte is for damage and the silence to pressure enemies.
---
Recount
---
Fishing is my only hold back. Otherwise just depends how I feel and if the lowbie is doing something funny (I'm generally not gonna be in a place a lowbie is for a reason other than trying to MC buff randoms cause that shit is fun). If I saw a 20 warlock running into BRD like I did with mine last night I'd protect them with my life lol

You caught a typo of mine.  Grats, that the first positive thing you have done in this thread.
---
Oof. Faerlina? Don't you guys have queues?
---
If you have a better metric or way to provide a more accurate comparison, I'm all ears.  I wouldn't have spent time working on this spreadsheet if I was satisfied with a quick but inaccurate answer.
---
Net mana is mana per cast plus the amount regened during that window.  I don't have a better way to estimate your regen.  However, I can say that if you are chain healing or maximizing your 5SR, you'll still have an overall casting and not casting ratio.  Without actually doing simulations for each boss and style of healing, I don't know a better way to approximate this.
---
This is not an end all be all analysis.  Just a starting point to say, hey, that spell power combo is actually better than your staff in this circumstance.  You or I need to work out whether that has relevance in the fight.  Am I at max mana constantly and my heals are barely keeping people alive due to burst damage? +healing wins.  If I'm in an easy healing situation but it's very long, where are my break points for efficiency?  Knowing that it takes a lot of casting to reach high efficiency with spell power can help decide what I want to equip.
---
I’m guessing it’s still best in slot, despite being level 43.
---
The physical servers are all in one data centre in the US. Technically infrastructure has move a lot in 15 years.
---
Nah the boys is an alliance guild on Ashkandi.
---
I had an NPC do that to me.
---
Ooooh thats nutty.
---
I got Atal'ai of the Bear my second time in ST, thought "good enough" and never went back.
---
it depends, do you find yourself dying a lot more?
---
In general since you should be farming green level creatures or aoe grinding them, you'll want more of the spelldamage gear. Look towards Dreamweave items if you can, as it also carries with it spirit for mana regen and int for raw mana and spell crit. Less stam overall but I find its worth it and helps you melt creatures faster anyhow.
---
If you're not using arcane explosion a lot you can even check out the tailoring patterns that has frost spell damage for the boots, pants, belt, bracers, shoulders, ect.
---
tl;dr, yeah spell damage if you're leveling/grinding green creatures, more health if you're tanking a lot of damage from creatures more your level.
---
My wife is the same. In life, she's incredibly modest, and worries if a shirt shows even a little bit too much cleavage. In gaming, she loves outfits that are ridiculous and sexy and show tons of skin. It's a fantasy, and she has fun with it.
---
She also gets incredibly irritated in threads where people get pissed off on her behalf, taking companies to task for outfits like this. Where they get super pissed at Blizzard or whoever for stuff like this. She's like, "I like it! Don't change it!"
---
It’s the best weapon in the game currently for bears
---
Oh, dude, me too. Gotta be blizzard's spaghetti code. I suppose the implication is that it would have crit had it not missed.
---
I main mage, i don't even have blizzard on my action bars. Dreading the day when people start expecting me to do this bs.
---
&gt; Because homophobia 
---
Because racism.
---
That's not equivalently toxic?  Do you think OP would be welcomed here if they asked about a black-only server, or a christian-only server? You don't see any similarity there?
---
&gt; ( you can still be executed for being gay in alot of countries just FYI) 
---
I know this.  (You can be killed in some countries because of your religion or nationality as well, just FYI.)
---
&gt; and some some made up hypothetical argument about white servers is totally the same right?
---
If OP was asking to join a whites-only server, what would you think of them? It's "made up" because I'm looking at their question from another, similar perspective.
---
&gt; You people really are stupid.
---
And "you people" are the ones throwing around personal attacks. You have no fucking clue what "people" I am.
---
I find mage is one of the best for 1vX. Great class to play.
---
You’re so right, didn’t even think about cross faction.
---
&gt;  Drinking after every single pull
---
lol that has literally nothing to do with being a bad mage, but keep up the circlejerk you're getting upvotes
---
3 Mages is too op for any tank/healer to pass on it.
---
Idk man. My raidmages usually are underneath me, as warlock. Especially if we get a crit and our shadowbolts do 20% more damage.
---
Never compromise your sarcasm with a /s - downvotes be damned
---
thank you for the explanation.
---
No, in general we couldn't care less about "best" warlock. We bring 3, one for each curse, and we don't care if they are level 55 or not. So if you don't obey the cc chart, no worries, you get a free HS back while I /who 55-60
---
That’s cool that you can have it leveling from 43’on then
---
Most people are in the mid to high 30s, per the last census app update.
---
And as tank I perfer rogues . . .  keeps me from running around the fucking map cause NO ONE TAKES THREAT REDUCTION TALENTS
---
Obsession is by definition unhealthy. No idea whats there to debate
---
So there is an effort involvement? It takes effort to organize a raid, less so if your raid buddies are all friends. Do we ban peeps with friends? I'm not trying to make a slippery slope argument, just show that it doesn't really make sense to ban multiboxers - they're physically controlling each account. Unless I guess blizzard restricted each physical human to one account, which seems impossible to enforce given that in my apartment (my ip address) there are at least 4 different accounts, up to 10 if friends are over with their laptops playing. Sometime my GF logs into her account on my laptop, etc.
---
You said you were killing quest NPCs. That's not anything to do with PvP, that's just griefing.
---
To piggyback off of you: The class distribution of Classic is an inversion of the class distribution in Vanilla according to data gathered by census addons.
---
In Vanilla, Druid was the most-played class, nearly tied by Hunter and Paladin.  Warriors, Mages, and Priests were middle-of-the-pack, with Shamans being the most unpopular class.
---
In Classic, probably due to a cultural desire to "min-max", the distribution shows a clear preference for classes that excel in endgame content.  Warriors are the most-played class by far, followed by Mages.  These two classes tower over all other classes at the moment.  Meanwhile, Druids and Paladins have become the least-played classes in Classic.
---
The race distribution paints a similar picture: Whereas Night Elves were the most popular race in Vanilla, they are one of the least-popular in Classic.  Undead, one of the least-played Vanilla races, has become the undisputed most-played race in Classic (probably due to racials).
---
My conclusion?  In Classic, players have prioritized gameplay advantages and endgame viability over class fantasy, and the widespread availability of information about the game has affected their decisions.
---
Yes, and armor too. But yes, it is enough for dungeons.
---
The problem in raids is crushing blows - this is a rule in the game that essentially means any skull mob has a chance for a physical attack to completely ignore your armor. This rule is based on defense level, so if you have enough defense, you can avoid crushing blows. There isn't enough +defense leather armor in the game to make it viable for druids, so they get crushing blows from skull mobs which ignore their massive amounts of armor.
---
To never “miss” a mele attack blizzard confirmed the cap is 9% from the believed 7% I think people thought it was. That will hit a level 63 mob and their Defense skill of 315. 
---
That is also considering a 300 weapon skill for character. So changes slightly with weapon skills. But 9% is a fair bit
---
I used multi shot fucking once during Majo fight, and the third shot flew across the fucking screen to hit the sheep
---
Garrote does not silence in Classic.
---
I do this too. I love giving bags to low lvl players
---
yes, but barely. Hit and resistances have more to do with level differential. 
---
As a rule of thumb, try to be leveling with creatures around 3 levels lower than you. Green creatures.
---
It does not proc it and I’m not sure actually if shadow wand dps is affected by shadow waving or the additions to shadow dmg. Anecdotally I didn’t notice much difference using the same wand and respeccing shadow at 40
---
But the sad thing is, holy talents help more with killing than healing dungeons. The main gains in the Holy tree are mostly for what you need to do in raids.
---
There isn't really a question though that after 40, shadow is worth 40% increased damage on your highest damage spells. Also 15% reduced physical damage is nothing to scoff at when you are leveling.
---
3 Mob pull Spellcleave seems to be the new trash-meta
---
does gauge in rouge count or is that not considered good?
---
Dude...I am so scared of pugs.  They are fucking insane.
---
Druid is meh because you will bite yourself in the ass later if you go for it specifically as healer. Simply cause you will be the least desired/invited healer. Druid is better if you enjoy the full variety of what they can do over just healing.  
---
Since its just Priest or Shaman left you answered your own question. Shaman annoys you and leveling phase is finite, while dropping totems wont ever stop.
---
What an ass.
---
Not really my experience tbh
---
And they cry when they think about it
---
we call them smooth brains
---
Very easy opinion and perspective to have when you don’t understand the struggle those groups are faced with
---
It's also really annoying the amount of people asking for water, If I gave everyone who asked water I literally wouldn't have time to do anything else. I tend to just ignore everyone unless someone says I'll pay.
---
Honestly they all have their pros and cons.
---
Loot council can promote favoritism.
---
EPGP/DKP can take a long time before you get an item especially if you are new and other ppl have been pooling their resources
---
/roll is the most fair imo as its straight RNG but RNG can also lead to problems , 1 person getting ALL the loot or none at all and people who have been "paying their dues" possibly not getting items they have been waiting for.
---
With a brand new guild tho EPGP is pretty fair , you start the first few weeks with a /roll system that affects the EPGP system, people that are tied roll for the item and then deduct the points of said item. that prevents people from hording all the loot and establishes the EPGP ecosystem
---
A penny saved is a penny earned.
---
Go through this thread and see who is being an asshole and a bigot to other people (Hint: you're one of them). 
---
And you talk to *me* about "fee fees"?
---
Yeah, sure.
---
New gnome players all go through the sadness of wanting a different mount haha, I've been there.
---
Nope, I am part of a minority too.
---
Good thing I have multiple stuns too and I don’t need stealth because I’m combat. Come at me Druid. 
---
I’ve never had an issue with them.
---
What are you talking about? They specifically said that they would take it out with phase 1.
---
I don't know where you're getting these ratios, according to wowhead [Rain of Fire](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11678/rain-of-fire) has an 8% per tick/32% per duration ratio while [Hellfire](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11684/hellfire) has a 2.2% per tick/33% per duration ratio.
---
The numbers in another comment agree with what Wowhead is saying.
---
Got it.  I saw a shadow wand in the AH going for much more than any other type, so I was wondering if that was a factor.
---
I had to drop a letter from the name I wanted when I made my character, and then ran into the guy with the name I wanted in the starter zone. So I missed the name I wanted by just minutes.
---
yeah if only he used a soft 'inside' voice and asked people if they were ok with his orders until he got a unanimous confirmation
---
Purge is spamable on gcd ^^
---
Did you max rank your abilities as you leveled up?
---
If you don't already have Bonebiter (2h axe reward from SM quest chain), then get it. Shreds through mobs at equal level or even higher level.
---
What's the box on the left with the names in it?
---
Yeah I love this so much as a druid. Mages think they're all hot shit until I come along with my 5/5 furor and wolfshead helm. Insta charge, insta stun, and 2 insta shreds if I time it right. The only thing that could make a mage win is if I have certain things on cd or if I run out of mana. Or he has insane luck with crits... 
---
I avoid fighting priests and warlocks entirely though. Those priest shields are insane and I'm dead within 1 warlock fear.
---
I wouldn't use daggers, its near impossible to get backstabs on mobs when you're questing.   
---
If you wanna go sub go hemo swords. Open with Cheapshot and then either slice and dice if they're gonna live a while, or hemo until you have 4+ combo points for evis. Use Ghostly strike on cooldown as well.
---
For a build I'd suggest something like this for leveling/dungeons  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/205003-3-500243102030121](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/205003-3-500243102030121)   
---
Could change it up depending on what you wanna do, but that's a decent hybrid solo leveling, dungeon group and pvp spec imo.
---
Nope. It'll be completely gone by no later than phase 2's launch. Earlier if they can manage it.
---
I'm so far behind on my 40 mount I might just keep hoofin it and keep the gold for my 60 mount.
---
Probably around 8-10 days played if I had to guess.
---
Succubus is the best choice for solo play. A felhunter is a close second. An imp is used for group play with a tank and healer. 
---
Why succubus for solo? It has the second best Mana regen. Second only to the imp. And it has very high damage without using mana. The imp uses mana to do damage, which means less mana for you to drain with dark pact. So for solo play the imp is a horrible choice. For party play, where the imp is not attacking, you can use it as a mana battery. 
---
The felhunter is a good choice for drain tanking. If you are pulling more than one mob (should not be a regular thing for drain tanking), the felhunter can hold agro on a second mob and take some hits. It has good damage and good hp. It also has good mana regen. It does less damage and has less regen than the succubus, so you should only use this if you are fighting casters, have pvp concerns (felhunter is better for some matchups), or cannot fear adds and need the summon to tank. 
---
The imp is a lousy solo play drain tank choice as you use it’s mana and it uses its mana. Unless you set the imp to never attack, mana becomes a problem. For dungeons, the imp can sometimes make sense. Why? Blood pact, phase shift, and only fireball occasionally as mana permits. A succubus is a decent dungeon choice, but outside of seduction it has limited use as sending it to melee range will often result in its death.
---
It’s important to note you aren’t exactly drain tanking in a 5 man. You are just using dark pact to keep your mana up so you can cast more dots, shadowbolts, rain of fires, hell fires, etc.
---
Nova is not really used for the root as much as it is used for the shatter effect. Getting shatter on CoC is a big damage boost.
---
I was running past Grom'gol, and noticed a Nightelf slightly ahead of me stray a little too close to the guards and get absolutely fucked by them.
---
I spent my Rebirth on them and they were super grateful, but it put a PvP Flag on me.
---
Continued North near the troll ruins, and found two 30ish trolls trying to get away from some murlocs with barely any health left. I picked up the murlocs in bear form, and got a /thank from them while they bandaged up. I swap out of bear to heal myself when a warrior with his Flag on charges out of nowhere and ganks me. 
---
I like to think the trolls told him he was a dick, but honestly not even sure.
---
&gt; That's what you get for not learning basic economics though.
---
Fun fact, I have a bachelor degree in economics, I just track an axe (the BiS for lvl 39 still haven't seen it - 4.0 speed) and casually checking how the same guys repost an item over and over again and it cost them money, that they don't get because they set unrealistic prices. and will never sell this item. 
---
My friend started too (never played WoW) and he didn't know about the deposit and that you lose the item if someone bid on it and the timer expires.
---
On Old Blanchy there's a guild called &lt;PRIDE&gt; that afverisdes as LGBT, but I don't know much beyond that.
---
Also requires a reagent
---
Then you should develop some empathy
---
Drink some kombucha brother, helps with gut issues
---
I was referring to paladins needing most of their mana to tank.
---
The attack speed doesn't really matter for pve, it's all the same dps.
---
No that is just private server crap
---
I went thru the thread: ur an asshole
---
Yes AE， arcane explosion
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olZEDkWtwjU
---
Theyre gonna have a fucking serious problem
---
Heads up guys: almost every rogue you run across isn’t stealth while he’s leveling, he’s a combat rogue.  Removing his stealth isn’t as damaging as you think.
---
You mean the guy that is southwest of the main camp, bought food from him last night
---
Because it's a one of a kind item.   One thing classic is garbage at is remotely decent Druid gear.  It's all either healing or hybrid/swiftshift pvp style gear.  Feral and Critchicken would actually be good if there was decent gear.
---
No, I don't mean Wingclipn to run, I mean Wingclip to kill. It sounds funny, but back during Tier2 days I was watching my guild duel and the Hunter named Johnxn challenged me, as a fully decked out in T2 level Shockadin plate I had never had issues fighting Hunters, so I do the typical strat of running into melee, figure I won, can't run from a Paladin with BoF and HoJ, he proceeds to kill me faster than I was prepared to react by spamming Wingclip and Raptor Strike. Shit hurts. From then on, I always respected Hunter's melee capabilities, it'll OOM them quick, but if you're dead, what do they care?.
---
You won't get to wear much plate. You will be stuffed in cloth and leather as Healing Paladin. Simply cause Ret Paladin is not viable at all and the Paladin sets dont have healing stats on them.
---
Dungeons man...
---
If I don't have the recipe, I can expect loot priority on it. If I'm already wearing the robe, I'll have to roll against 4 other people.
---
Wow that's weird! Sorry to hear that. Must be an EU thing? I'm not sure. Like I said no issues with Kromcrush at high.
---
I've always wondered what could possibly be behind that giant wall in silverpine. I imagine later expansions put something there, but I don't want to look because I'm sure it will disappoint me.
---
My buddy attacks most anyone he thinks is going to give a good fight, meanwhile I stand by and watch his duel, intervening when someone tries to help his prey. Fun to watch, no one's won against him yet.
---
didnt shield walled at kargath
---
Thanks mate!
---
"Fair enough"? There's nothing fair about it. 
---
The imbalanced PvP server experience is very different for the dominant faction compared to the minority faction. The fair thing to do for members of the former is to accept the limitations of their experience and listen to those who actually do know what they are talking about when they discuss the difficulties of being the minority faction. 
---
Being deliberately obtuse has nothing to do with fairness.
---
It's CC. it's just very soft cc because.it doesn't last long and is broken by damage. But as a rogue, gauge is an integral part of your cc chain, because it gives you a moment to get your energy back and your CDs back
---
blade flurry does not work like it does on live. In classic its a CD that increases attack speed by 20% and making attacks hit one extra target. Also the better daggers build (which uses backstab and ambush) is the combat daggers build until like AQ40 when seal fate just scales with more crit
---
Full Retri and healed Mauradon twice today no sweat. Just have a separate cloth outfit with lots of good stats and a suitable weapon and offhand. Elixirs of int and spirit help too. There’s one that tops up both
---
he's to low for 1k Needles. Most stuff there is level 33+.
---
I don't mind other people doing spellcleaves, you would have bad tanks either way. I do find it funny when mages try to bribe me into joining spellcleave groups on my warlock.
---
But we don't have a pet to unconditionally love us like you guys. :(
---
It's real potential is in PvP when you need to reset the fight or pool energy.
---
Amen
---
Should NEVER mind blast high health targets. It's cooldown is too long to get 2 anyway most times, just do it when the mob is at 25%.
---
But mages only have 3 spells: Frost Nova, Blink, and Blizzard  
---
I'm sure the other two were on cooldown
---
I see. o.o ty for clarifying !
---
What level does the 38 elite mobs in the very beginning of SM Cath become grey?
---
So the difference is basically negligible? Just follow the guides for BiS regardless of race and go for the highest dps weapon regardless of weapon type. The racial is just a small bonus
---
Isn't this against the rules?
---
You talk like you have insecurity issues.
---
Because this sub makes it a much bigger deal than it actually is. Are they out there? sure. but it's never been a problem for me and I'm on one of the most populated servers
---
&gt; And it didn't consume ammo. There were times where I didn't want to admit to the group that I forgot to buy arrows, so I'd volley the whole time.
---
Holy shit you just made my day lol
---
A hunter killed my succubus before killing me. I sort of didn't get it since I lose a soul shard anyway and my pets are very disposible.
---
Thank you! I got very lucky with Arcane Crystals (x9) and was first to a lot of zones so I made a lot of money off those, spent roughly 500 gold on Runecloth :( - I had it quite easy to be fair... Sold all my thorium and got a couple of BiS blue world drops. Didn't feel too bad!
---
I see anti lgbtq speech in general chat all the time. Nobody should be forced to endure that if they don’t want too.
---
Leather gear is the least of worries. Deathwish on cooldown. With 3,5k health in BRD and up.
---
In the words of the "tank": Healer is shit and left after eating a 2,5k crit from Kirtonos and a hit more afterwards that killed him both before a FoL cast was done. 
---
Feels kinda strange as a paladin who solo heals UBRS and who was just in it for the dark runes.
---
Next run then is a druid who is shy about tanking and says that his tanking gear is shit. Still 5k health and more armor hen the last 3 warrior tanks combined.
---
the better question is how are you getting spell power before lvl 40
---
Bartender you can scale the action bars and change how many buttons are in them.
---
It's far superior when you get the proc. The rest of the time it feels basically the same. 
---
Not sure I can prove this, but I also feel like the larger the level discrepancy between you and the axe, the less often it procs. I used Ravager up until the mid 40s, but at that point getting a Bladestorm proc was so rare that I replaced it when a better weapon came along.
---
Ya I believe you, just seems like time is better spent per hour just farming herbs/ore. Cause why waste time killing princess for potentially, at max like 5g or whatever the staff sells for, when you can just farm herbs/ore else where
---
It's more that its a pita when u get a massive overheal just after you cast drain life.  Unless you actually drain for the life that just throws away mana and loc spells aren't the cheapest. 
---
For this reason I would always take a hot over a big heal every time.  It allows better management of siphons and drains and results in far less wastage of mana/health for both the healer and the loc
---
If someone is doing something in such a way to make mobs evade where they can't be touched you better believe Blizz can ban for this. Back in Vanilla you could bug out the Raptor boss by standing on a certain spot to where you could kill him but he couldn't touch you. My buddy got banned for 3 months cause of it.
---
No, because I ended up rolling Alliance. Guess I could still try it though even if there aren't a lot of horde coming through.
---
Yes, both the totem and their own buff.
---
I dont think they hate anyone theyre probably just feeling cornered and are lashing out. But i do think its irrelevant what your sexuality or gender is when playing WoW because its a place to escape from that reality and immerse yourself in the fantasy world. Theres bound to be edgelords who make jokes at the expense of LGBT people but thats why you avoid and shame those people for being assholes. 
---
This thread is just dumb. Even on a "lgbt friendly" server (if there is one.. i cant understand how youd even measure that or definitively say one server is more accepting than another) youre always going to be dealing with stupid kids who say stupid shit because surprise...its the internet.
---
I say this as someone whos technically apart of the lgbt "community", OP is enabling their own victimhood by engaging the people trolling them in these comments and itll only get worse and worse. Theres a million ways and one to go about finding people who accept you. Posting about it on a subreddit dedicated to the game isnt one of them. Literally nobody cares about OPs gender or sexuality and theyre taking that response to mean they're hated or something. Its dumb.
---
competing against the 4+ other priests that your raid stacked so you have enough dispells to give your single hunter tranq shot.
---
take a look for quests in: ungoro, western &amp; eastern plaguelands, felwood, azshara, winterspring,  burning steppes, &amp; the blasted lands
---
It's nice that you want us to dominate you, hun, but if you're that hard up for punishment, just bring a few with you to the Gurubashi Arena.
---
Recommend going prot around 58 so you can gear up in dungeons easily instead of questing. Until then arms is way more fun.
---
Circle is tank. Almost never mark saps, they are trash. It's almost always going to end up better to just tank the whole pack than to risk sapping one. I would have a hunter pet OT a mob before I had a rogue sap one.
---
Oh nice exploit hope you get banned.
---
Both are great. Warlocks eat mages. Mages eat rogues/warriors. Rogues/warriors eat warlocks, kind of.
---
There are physical data centers in Chicago and Los Angeles.
---
Only a few. I’ve been pretty frugal with my skills.   
---
     
---
My gold problems mainly stemmed from wanting to keep up to date with my professions (tailoring + enchanting) because I really want “Smoking Heart of the Mountain” as soon as possible.  Also I bought the aforementioned Wolfshead Helmet off the AH and that shot a huge chunk of my savings.    
---
I’ll get my Kodo eventually :)
---
Yeah I see where your coming from, it definitely adds a level of mystique as you say knowing no-one is running endgame raids on farm yet. Twitch has maybe sensationalized this because the majority of players have jobs or other commitments and are probably not max level yet. Personally I'm looking forward to the pvp phase, I think that will motivate a lot of players to level and gear up to stay competitive when the honor system and BG's start rolling out.
---
Good luck finding a good route on Whitemane (my server).
---
So you got one instance of a retarded player and immediately blame the mass community of mages and warriors. Nice
---
Depending on your level, I don’t think anywhere beats the coastlines in STV. Just be sure to fish every pool you come across. Each one has a chance to spawn as wreckage. Leaving Firefin pools, etc sitting there only hurts you if you’re doing loops.
---
I always thought the consensus was that a rogue with cool downs is THE best pvp class solo
---
LBRS is prolly fine as shadow. LBRS is a snoozefest. Just don't do the ogre encounter.
---
Which is hilarious because I've seen more tanks pop sheep than anybody doing AoE spellcleaves
---
This guy literally runs up into melee range to Nova and CoC, he was never staying in &gt;5 yards &lt;8 yards the entire time, almost no one you come across will be able to do so either. Between lag and how hard it is to do against someone moving, even while snared. The Hunter in the clip was just blind sided and never reacted. There wasn't even an attempt to dodge the shatter combo Frostbolt with Feign Death. Either on CD or clueless. Does getting in melee range always win you a fight as a Hunter? No, but sitting there doing neither ranged or melee is always a loss.
---
If you're in a group or dungeon with a mage it's free, but if you ask in a major city and you're not in a group, then it's customary to tip
---
Spell damage is garbage for aoeing.
---
Sounds like fun!
---
As to your question, I have no idea. I know people fumed about it for years, and we all assumed they would fix this problem with every patch. Never really happened, although a few BWL, AQ40/Naxx druids eventually got there, to my knowledge they really only managed it by having already completed the content (likely as a healer), and picking up trinkets/rings etc. no longer needed by the progressing guild.
---
I always saw it as warriors used a reskinned pally set lol
---
Edit: there not even reskinned if I remember correctly, they are the exact same skin
---
Auctioneer or TSM works as well
---
Mages definitely aren't as reliant on cooldowns as rogues. But at least in 1v2,3 situations, having a reset on nova, CoC, barrier, ice block, etc. can be the difference between winning and losing.
---
Oh and Stonescale Eel spawns here too which is a huge bonus when hunting wreckages.
---
Same in Tukui. Doesn’t show the pet in party frames. I’ve searched for answers but found none
---
Not sure about other groups, but I intentionally do not invite hunters. Bad dps, never trap, where is your pet going...
---
Sigh, yes.
---
Take a note from Jagex, but don’t copy them. OSRS has missed out on some good content drops because a small, but large enough, group of players didn’t want it.
---
My secret reshade that I use for basically every game I play. PATHOS reshade for Witcher 3. Takes away some details with ambient light but also adds definition to textures with luma sharpen. I love it. You can find the exact settings I use in the sticky post of my Skyrim mod Majestic Mountains - Northside.
---
As for Plater it does seem complicated but I just made the enemy and friendly tabs all match the default friendly player tab which gives you these nice minimal nameplates. I think it's possible for me to export my profile as text so I'll try that later.
---
this is so god damn true
---
I've seen so many people move their player and target frame to your location.  I get why, your health is right there, their health is right there, but I just can not get used to it.  Is it really that beneficial?
---
Idk for raiding but I did have a good comparison while I was running uldaman as a lv 43 hunter with a lv 50 hunter. My BT was doing more auto attack damage at level 43 than his wind serpent at lv 50. He wasn't using aimed shot either so he was most likely BM like I was
---
My DMs are always open.
---
*wink wink*
---
lol what
---
respec costs don't make people play retarded hybrid pve/pvp specs, they just shit all over classes that have the biggest difference between their raid and pvp specs
---
&gt; I've seen streamers tank with no shield
---
/kick armstank
---
/5 LF1M Tank ZF
---
1 orb, that’s fair. Reserving ALL orbs? You are a big ole piece of shit who won’t get a group
---
Biggles is crowded af right now, idk what realm you're on.
---
Personally I thought DKs fucked things up too much and wasn't fond of a lot of the class changes, its when I felt the game I enjoyed was gone.
---
Later, when I heard they were removing talents, I knew that game was gone forever.
---
But now, here we are.
---
Key word: reworked
---
You vendored gear based on how it looks?  that's some fucking casual shit.
---
Our guild has like 10 mages in a 40 (we bring closer to 30, 35 thought) man raid. The moaning for loot is real, meanwhile I'm one of two warlocks in the entire guild.
---
In my groups, it’s more like:
---
“None” = SMASH
---
The amount of times the skull and X are taking less than a third unmarked enemy is too damn high!
---
"full t2", though technically available in p3, expect it to not happen until about phase 5, since every priest in the guild having 3p t2 will probably be higher priority than juicing out a single priest.
---
No, this is not a common problem.  Post your PC specs?  How reliable is your network?
---
They should have Burqas in WOW.
---
If you're spamming different targets on a pull you marked me to sheep someone, that's your fault and only your fault
---
Honestly varies a lot based on playstyle, how much you care about going fast, if you're doing professions at the same time etc. Anywhere from 5 days to 15 days is probably common.
---
Having weird characters in your name for sure makes it so you get less group invites I feel like
---
Not so much in 1.12. I think mage might be overall more meta.
---
For solo pvp in open world though? Perhaps even so.
---
I feel like as a bear tank we almost need pamphlets of the treatise on bear tanking to hand out. Like, there is a role for us in the game but we only need a few MCPs for a full clear compared to a cat with a normal run. Bears spamming MCPs is for like... speedrunners.
---
Also @ the people who are like '... but how will BEAR be competituve with WARRIOR without 5 million MCPs???'... at least on my server there are few enough tanks period that competition with warriors is kinda a moot point (plus, fury warriors generally want to go ham w/ damage - they are not interested in competing for our offtank spot). Even if it was a competition the big advantage of me over a fury warrior is i can decurse, i won't touch plate drops, the leather drops i want are generally not the ones rogues are interested in, and in a pinch i can slap on a healing set if i'm not needed for dps or offtanking.
---
MCP is a nice tool for bears - but outside of niche progression or speedruns it isn't our big draw for the vast majority of guilds.
---
Everyone in this thread shoulda rolled on a Normal server or stuck with retail.
---
Kill on sight.
---
I lost count of the amount of times I told a group today to wait a sec so I could drink between the endless pulls, then they seemed surprised that I couldn't heal everyone at once. The warrior seemed so proud of their dps, the 2 rogues were just derping it as much as possible, and the mage...
---
I feel like I might have to start asking for groups that want to run an old-school dungeon style, and not just Leeroy it and wank themselves crazy over the dps..
---
Tanks are currently harder to replace then healers, so yes healers have to put up with quite a lot of tanks that somehow manage to take more damage then a rogue tanking.
---
i got to level 49 and equipped my BiS ring and then my zygor guides told me to put back on my green ring because it has more agility lol.
---
Ahh Blizzard before the SJWs completely scared them away from fun shit.
---
I don't actually get all the hype about that guy. So he is a streamer... OK and why do you care and why would I need to care. I have seen his face he looks bored like crazy.
---
You say that as if it being marked by a moon and saying "sheep moon" in chat does anything lol. They still break it, trust me i have the macro
---
Ignoring the axe skill because I assume you have it maxed and are killing creatures who are at or below your level:
---
5% to deal an additional 100% damage is nothing to sniff at.
---
Whirlwind axe is what, 3.6 sec weapon swings?
---
Statistically speaking, You'll crit like once more per minute for an additional ~125 damage + bonus attack power damage. 
---
Blade of the titans deal 6.25 more dps every second, meaning in about the same minute, it's doing 6.25 * 60 or 375 additional damage before adding in any attack power modifiers.
---
That said the critical strike chance thing is random chance and cant really be quantified accurately. If you crit 3 times a minute, it will probably average out, if you arent critting like 3 times a minute, the sword does heaps more damage and does it consistantly without gambling, plus if you respec sword spec, 5% of the time you deal the extra swing of damage anyway.
---
that's what skinning and mining are for, you scrub.
---
I am currently leveling tailoring just for Robe of the Archmage and definitely considering this so I can be Engineering/Enchanting afterwards. Doesn't seem to be too much gold making potential in tailoring anyway.
---
Wow, I play a warrior tank and my wife plays a holy priest, so we are able to put a group together pretty easy. I would never do this. Only thing I am sometime picky about is what class I invite as a dps, so everyone can get what they are looking for from boss drops etc.
---
This got me thinking, most of the time I'm grinding for my BIS in a dungeon and been questing/leveling that way. Even I do get a mount, I still gotta wait for those who don't have a mount or getting ganked in Blackrock. I'm not quite sure it's worth the investment right now at least for me. Great to have for WPVP so gonna pick it up eventually.
---
This information he gave is wrong.
---
What’s funny is that “spellcleave” is significantly harder to pull off than a standard group.
---
&gt; and now that's all you see at aoe viable spots
---
Best part is that those spots are no longer viable for aoe xping since they are so crowed but they keep on trying to xp none the less.
---
*cries in tank*
---
Your luck is insane
---
Im pretty sure heroic strike doesnt scale off weapon damage. 
---
For me its the same with my 1 hand as it is with my 2 hander.
---
That is the numbers for PVP not PVE.
---
Deathbringers Will was an amazing warrior trinket. I think it was fought over by all melee (and hunters?)
---
GBank is needed so badly, I really miss achievements, working in-dungeon maps (non-mod), and... Guild/game API stuff.
---
I actually like the high respec costs, I feel like it makes me really commit to things and punish players who don't.
---
Perfect, I can't wait to watch a 3 and a half minute video instead of simply copy/pasting the two macros that could have been posted in its place.
---
Yeah people don’t really bother until late game pre bis stuff
---
You still have to compete with people from your faction.
---
Sounds like hunter would be what you want
---
Sounds like you dropped the wrong quest by mistake.
---
I’m in the same boat keep getting kicked cause I’m not AoE spec
---
Oh was it a talent?
---
I must say having explored most places now that they definitely overdid wolves in classic. They’re fucking everywhere. And always a massive pain in the ass
---
The yellow hitcap versus +3 lvl higher mobs than you(bosses) is 9% with 300, and 6% with 305. So it gives 3% hit going from 300-&gt;305. I don't think it's realistic to get another % hit from weapon skill alone though, that would be too much.
---
Looks like you found my mixtape.
---
The statement was not about a type of game but WHEN a game was released. And Skyrim was released in 2011.
---
I think this is what they were saying
---
‘Classic WoW is the most fun I’ve had in a game since 2013. It’s so active! People talk, and people *want* to talk. Dungeons are so good, being randomly bugged (talked to) by someone. 
---
I was doing that fishing quest in Darkshore when two other warriors joined to do the same quest, and I then said ‘What’s up, clone?’ And to my amazement, they said the exact same thing in response! Throughout the 2-3 hours in Darkshore, I kept bumping into them. It was great!
---
That’s WoW classic, being in random social situations and somebody actually responds to you.’
---
One of my favorite starting dungeons. So immersive running around a keep. Like a mini karazhan.
---
To all you horde who say, "wow, use every cooldown". I say , "Well don't gank me"
---
Download questie and see what areas are 45-55 or 50-60, bounce from one hub to the next. Basically repeat what you did 38-50 (STV, Hinterlands, Feralis, Tanaris) with Un’Goro, swamp, Plaguelands later on, etc.
---
Just grind extra mobs while you’re out questing and it should get you CLOSE to 60 so you only have to pure grind/dungeon for a bit (some people run out of quests by 58).
---
You can, but I suspect the player in question is not familiar with mouseover functionality, given they're unfamiliar with macros.  Better to ease them into it by starting simple and expanding from there.
---
Imagine making an ignorant comment to try to look cool.
---
I'd say Maraudon/ZF is a good cutoff, so like 40s. I remember those being the first time I really felt like a tank. But in general, it's not that you CAN'T tank as Arms, just that it's harder.
---
I saw him at Blizzcon last year and honestly he just looked...scared.
---
Pirate cove in tanaris and ogre area in feralas have been the worst spots for me so far as alliance. I completely avoided stv and stonetalone. Luckily being a druid I can sneak around and wait for the higher levels just looking to gank to leave. As i write down there name for future reference.
---
If you dont join wirld defense lfg will be channel 4. You can swap them around based on what order you join them or by moving them in chat window settings
---
It had been believed to be 8% because in the calculation of 300 weapon skill vs 315 defense it IS 8%.   However there was a built in 1% chance to miss that pservers weren't aware of.  A blue post came out and clarified that was a missing part of the formula.  So 300 WS to 315 defense is 9% and 305 weapon skill to 315 defense is 6%.  Getting 5 weaponskill from racial or items is a huge thing then you only need 3% on gear (since the talent gives 3% as well).
---
HOT DAMN, NSFW WARNING NEXT TIME!
---
The metric is that it is no longer catering to white men to such a degree that it is a coincidence if others like it.
---
Because the right needs their safe spaces where they can pretend to be special snowflakes.
---
I use 1.6g+ in water per instance at 42. Melon Juice is 80s per stack. It only gets worse at 45. It is expensive, because you’re effectively paying for everyone else in the party to get exp.
---
It’s miserable when you have a warlock spamming lifetap.
---
Just imagine the cloak wasn’t used for a quest and still had no good stats. A level 30 is not going to pay any significant coin for it just because the mats are expensive for you to make it. It has no use to them so the value is 0.
---
I've been adding every single good player I've run with since like level 25 for this very reason. I got like 40+ characters on my friends list with notes like 'good healer', 'good prot paladin', 'good single-target warlock', etc. Not only do I know they're good, I make note of what they are so I can grab from a large pool of known-good players of all kinds of different classes and specs so I can try to piece together whatever kind of group comp I'm looking for. Collect the best people from PUG groups and keep them around, by the time I get to BRD hopefully a lot of them will still be around and at the same level so I don't end up 4 hours into a BRD run and have half the group dip like that, lol.
---
As a hunter, no I don’t. Having to run back to my corpse, Rezz my pet and drink up is much more annoying then rezz and feed. After all, that’s why I have a pet, to sacrifice it for me.
---
I'm getting harassed on a daily basis for my minority and you don't see my backing down to servers specifically tailored to me. People really don't have strong opinions about LGBTQ, but you are seem afraid to realize it.
---
What would've been better? Boar for charge?
---
For when you just have to watch other people play a game while you're playing a game!
---
... Blizzard Entertainment.
---
Take higher damage imo. At your level it won’t matter much. Go for the sm arms axe later or any 40+ dungeon weapon.
---
The guy arguing with you has apparently never heard of speedrunning...
---
&gt;Or am I clearly missing something?
---
There's that thing I was missing.
---
thanks mate
---
Why would a priest roll against a warrior?
---
But again, nobody's forcing you to join those runs.   If you sign up to join a run that has items reserved, then you either take it or leave it.  You can't join and then bitch about it.  You chose to join.
---
Pretty sure I'm gonna start a guild that is specifically for non minmaxers. I hate meta in games, kills the personalization of  an RPG and is so boring
---
This. If you are gathering/questing/farming in the open world, you are basically untouchable by mobs and most enemy players once you've got an epic mount. Worth every gold.
---
Stupid people are generally worried they won't be listened to, so they speak louder or repeat themselves to drown out better things said.
---
Ah. Yeah idk them, I just know weapon skill it gud in raids. Was going to figure out all that math nerd shit later.
---
Regardless, I don't think it's possible to get even .5% reduced miss chance out of weapon skill from items, right?
---
I could see that possibly being the case in Vanilla, but where Classic pairs the Legion client/backend with the Vanilla database, it retains many advanced features like name suggestions when typing.
---
Plus being able to right click names in chat makes it easy to send invites, whisper, etc...
---
Fastest warrior is measured in months.
---
Fawk, from the thumbnail, I thought that was the Winterspring Frostsaber, now that would be something. I mean, grats on getting Exalted with Night Elves, that's a decent achievement in itself for a Human/Dwarf/Gnome. Are you going for WF next?
---
I did this on my rogue to someone on their mount . I sent them off the bridge connecting to Wetlands
---
I promise as a hunter killing pets is a sure way im going to kill you. If you take me out of range ill lose 90% of the time. Ignore my pet, i can get a new one
---
I hate gnomes
---
The correct answer is Gatorbite axe from Maraudon.
---
It’s bis until aq40 robes and even then it’s a sidegrade.
---
Sulfuras actually, but ty all the same!
---
&gt;  Good raids, but admittedly the best of them (Karazhan) was originally meant to be a vanilla raid.
---
In other words, good raids.
---
&gt; Terrible dungeons. Every dungeon is basically the same 3-4 boss linear hallway with absolutely nothing memorable about any of them.
---
Deadmines*, RFC, SFK, BFD, RFK, all SM wings, ZF,  LBRS, UBRS, Scholomance,  and the individual wings of Strat almost entirely follow the "room/hallway followed by another room/hallway" formula, with only an occasional detour.  Even when there are alternate routes (like ZF), they are basically never used.  And the bosses in TBC dungeons are all at least bosses that do things, not just a more-powerful standard mob like most vanilla bosses.
---
&gt; Terrible aesthetic/design. Does anyone like Shattrath or Tempest Keep dungeons? The Draenei city? It's all hideous.
---
Nagrand, Zangarmarsh, Shadowmoon Valley, Azuremyst Isle, and Terokkar Forest are all among my favorite zones, and Shat is one of my favorite cities.  Almost all of the tier sets are fantastic.  I don't care for the crystal shit or a lot of the leveling gear, but most of my favorite looking stuff is from TBC.
---
&gt;  Flying mounts which destroy world pvp. World pvp has been the most fun part of WoW classic. The only place which had world pvp was the Isle of Quel Danas, but that would be last phase content for TBC so it wouldn't exist for most of the expansion. Outland itself almost never had pvp.
---
World PvP is 98% unfair ganking.  Wow how fun.  And no amount of flying will save you from the carnage at Elemetal Plateau, you either have to fight or run away, just like you'd do in vanilla.
---
&gt;  Boring repetitive daily content. Ogri'la and Netherwing dailies are not fun.
---
Unlike vanilla's totally fun content of running around farming herbs, ore, rep, or whatever.  I'm not a fan of dailies either but don't pretend that they're somehow worse than the braindead farming you do in vanilla.
---
&gt; Badge of Justice catchup mechanics, etc.
---
Because vanilla totally didn't have entire patches that redid dungeon items to help out fresh raiders, or remade the PvP sets when the old ones were clearly getting outdated, and they totally don't have a new set of dungeons coming out in phase 2 with better gear.  Give me a break.
---
&gt; Because then we’d be right back where we were. TBC will bring flying, Wrath will bring gearscore and LFG, Cata will fuck up the world again, Mists will bring LFR, etc
---
And BFA classic will bring back ClassicClassic. The cycle repeats.
---
My favourite quote so far is "I have to use a two hander because my one handed skill is too low."
---
From a warrior who specifically joined the group to tank, and neglected to mention this until we were at the dungeon and pulling trash.
---
That's why you set up an interval gust wind chamber behind your birb.  Thought that was obvious.
---
Enjoy it while it lasts. Trinket and gear shifts the battle heavily later on.
---
&gt;People really don't have strong opinions about LGBTQ, but you are seem afraid to realize it.
---
Try harder next time
---
If it was full mara. It can definitely get worse than 2 hours
---
MoP did redesigns pretty well, I enjoyed playing all classes and specs back then.
---
Now they seem to just weirdly rework the class every xpack
---
I rather stick with the words definition, but whatever floats your boat
---
This guy wrote his Thesis on the importance of easily accessible porn online.
---
Axe is slowest. So best dmg overall. The sword is too fast. The mace is not as slow as the axe.
---
Going to necro this, has blizzard acknowledged this yet? I can't find any blue post in it.
---
Look I'm very in the pro-world PvP camp, and I find it silly when people cry about PvP on a PvP server.
---
But your post here is just stupid lol
---
Cool.
---
Good points. I love telling people that in classic you don't have a spec, you have a class.
---
SM is the first real healing check; dungeons before just don't have the difficulty, burst, or pacing of the previous dungeons. How much spirit are you stacking? Are you using the 5SR as much as possible? Are you downranking (you should not be)? Are you combat drinking? Are they pulling too much, or too fast?
---
I had serious issues when I first hit SM, and really had to step up my game with *very aggressive* drinking and healing to really focus on minimizing downtime with my melee cleave group. IMO cath in the late 40's was the hardest dungeon I ran leveling; it hammered out a lot of bad healing habits I had and ZF/mara/uld/ST went much better in comparison.
---
when someone pees ice shards on me I will submit
---
They are also the biggest Crybaby class in general.  
---
Wanna know why your class got nerfed, vanilla or retail? Go check the mage forums. 85%-95% of the time there will be a bunch of posts on the mage forums about nerfing your class for some raisin, and Blizzard historically has caved everytime mages started up their "nerf nao!" cry fest.
---
Glad I don’t play with you
---
Release your charge
---
Any idea how much of BRD can be tanked with a two-hander at level 56 Arms? I'm planning to tank my first BRD soon and was wondering how much damage I should expect to be taking. The last dungeon I tanked was Maraudon which I did about 95% of it with the the 2H. I do have a shield and Thrasher Blade if I need it, I just find it much easier to keep threat by focusing on doing DPS with the 2H instead.
---
Yea thats a fucked run i did it last weekend
---
Effects affect you.
---
 /shudder
---
/respec
---
why are locks always so salty? You guys have pets that keep you alive plus health AND soul stones, priests can heal themselves, mages have absolutely no heals, they to have other tools to stay alive
---
&gt; My server is overrun with really really bad mages. Theres more people playing mage than any other class by a longshot and most of them are terrible.
---
Advertise "ZE SUPER FAST XP METHOD WORLD FIRST CLASSIC WORLD OF WARCRAFT WORKING 100% OF THE TIME 1% OF THE TIME" with one of the most complete class of the game (i would say the best designed) and bam, every single mongo will play it lmao.
---
My main is a mage. The first thing I do in groups is buff everyone (easy as 1 button thanks to arcane brilliance), and provide food/drink for each member. At the end I open portals to wherever people want to go. I also go out of my way to give people food/water and ports out in the world for those that ask, tips or not. 20s reagents are nothing for a class that can make gold hand over fist.
---
Making downtime smoother is equally as important as DPS. If you refuse to help the group in any way you can, then why are you there? You can easily be replaced by any of the other 15000 mages on your server. The good ones earn their keep.
---
I mained a hunter in vanilla. I refused to be a huntard then (didn't roll on gear that wasn't a clear statistical improvement and I was the designated kiter/tranq shot in our raids), and I refuse to be a magetard now. Being a vending machine is just as much our responsibility as is being the top aoe dps and cc.
---
No no. I feel lucky enough that we got the kill while wiping. It enabled me to exact revenge on him.
---
I’d go get the bonebiter as alliance. Better and easier than ww axe.
---
Oh shit I was thinking the Spyglass from ship for some reason
---
I am only 47 yet, so no opinion on that
---
It just depends on your character, my /4 is world chat joined with /join world
---
it's only good for the armor stat. Literally only useful when tanking raids or dungeon bosses because of this. You wouldn't use it for anything else.
---
I just did it last night lol, towards the end we ran into 2 ally players and we killed them mercilessly, rofl
---
Lol seriously this needs more upvotes
---
Oh right, forgot about barrier tbh
---
You think you don't, but you do!
---
We all seem to dislike him and that’s okay, just the need to post literally everything he says as a way to shit on him is whack.
---
I think the dungeon here would be, like, a faction of Night Elves that are pissed off that the folks over in Teldrassil tossed themselves in with the alliance, believing that Gnomeregan and Ironforge are both attacks on their previously held way of life. In an effort to fight off the dangers of their industrialization, they've been causing trouble, and you, a noble hero of the Alliance, are required with all of your friends to go out and quash any sort of resistance, kinda like you did with the Defias.
---
I agree that dps wars are the new huntards. Mongoloid imbeciles that SHOULD know better when it comes to threat.
---
Yet every one ive ever seen just cleave spams, doesnt kick, doesnt focus the right target. And i have to roll a against them.
---
(But i dont have to roll against them because i dont let them in my groups rofl)
---
Could not agree more
---
First character in classic ~7 days 20 hours, second character I am going to exceed it by probably a day. On track for 8 day some hours /played. Should be done tomorrow/Saturday.
---
Depends a lot on class, style, how many dungeons and how fast they are.
---
But in the end, it won't be relevant for a month
---
I was wondering why I’ve run Maraudon 5 times and only won 3 rolls
---
...if your server is 50/50
---
I mean you can always just flag up as well
---
I wish there were more druid tanks.  Ive done 2-3 runs with them now and theyre easier than shit to heal for the most part.
---
Even the groups are easier to heal since they seem to do better at holding agro.
---
Ah, a student of Daphne Stilwell!
---
Unfortunately a lot of locks don't do that. Wish more did
---
If you google "classic dungeon leveling guide" you'll find a link to a site that shows the levels for all dungeons, and how to go about getting quests for them.
---
No, thank you!
---
Dude is that Esfand?
---
Thanks man!   
---
It's based on these two resources, both INCREDIBLE reads if you wanna get into the nitty gritty of tanking:

This stuff will basically blow your mind (things like wether or not the tank pulls the mob will affect wether or not the tank will retain aggro after a taunt is used is seriously bonkers to read about). Enjoy!
---
Pvp is fine in thunderfury for alliance. I'm only lvl 33 tho
---
&gt;That's not equivalently toxic?  Do you think OP would be welcomed here if they asked about a black-only server, or a christian-only server? You don't see any similarity there?  
---
&gt;If OP was asking to join a  whites-only server, what would you think of them? It's "made up" because  I'm looking at their question from another, similar perspective.
---
OP didn't ask for an LGBT-exclusive server, only for one that doesn't allow discrimination. The equivalent would be to have not a black-only or white-only server, but one where ethnic discrimination isn't tolerated.
---
I think part of the low prices is a large chunk of the community is still leveling so there is lots of currency being taken out of the game by skill training/mount purchasing so inflation hasn't had a chance to kick in yet, but I could be wrong.  I expect that material prices will increas once there is more liquid currency on the servers and more people are able to buy mats for profession leveling.
---
Helped a ton, thank you!
---
Now... any idea how to get a second smart cursor on the right half of the screen for camera position?
---
Been using /script SetView(5);SetView(5) to reset camera each time it gets out of whack...
---
Your opinion my dude. Some people enjoy it just like football,baseball, etc. I basically agree I don’t watch streams too much. I also can admit I’ve learned a few things from streamers that has helped
---
[Orly?](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10726/gnomish-mind-control-cap)
---
This but unironically
---
Why would you play a PVP server if you don't have fun with the faction war thing?
---
Yeah, the story in itself is worth to facepalm at, but coming to the conclusion that this is the fault of spellcleave and not someone being dumb is quite pulled out of ones arse.
---
I get strawmanning the shit out of my position, but I really wish you hadn't gone as far as calling me a fucking pedophile. Go fuck yourself.
---
but the effect part also applies to damage spells right?
---
What? It's a good, good wand.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, not playing a warrior right now, but the tooltip says "strong attack that increases melee damage by X". To me, that implies that it uses your base damage in the calculation.
---
Go get the add-on consoleport, it has some really nice camera settings for controller use which should translate well with touch controls.
---
Why would layering change anything? A ganker/griefer could just switch layers untill he get's to the same layer as the other player. This has already been happening to famous players.
---
Can we not? I'm hungry.
---
Mind=blown

I'm a 31 Paladin, I can hear the distant sounds of fortunate son.

Music is credited in the description. It's a royalty free track from www.bensound.com that I thought sounded nice.
---
Pretty sure my channel would get nuked if I tried using music from a major IP like The Last of us.
---
&gt; my boomer mentality of wow 
---
wtf is that even supposed to mean?
---
Imagine actually caring about levelling up, getting gear, and doing dungeons
---
I’m level 43 and I hav 30g I feel your pain
---
Same issue I think -randomly got DC'd - Battlenet trying to download a small 6gb patch but failing and trying to load classic just takes me back to Retail WoW through Battlenet
---
I has this idea before but. You know what i would think would be perfect for a zone like this? All of northrend. Northrend is the continent that i think would make a lot of sense to eventually add to a classic+. But as an elite zone for max level characters  going there should be dangerous and you wouldnt spend your whole time there instead of the old world. Ofc i dont have this all thought out but i think it would be cool if implemented right. Let me feel like its dangerous to go there. Give me a reason to go there once in a while for short periods of time while kalimdor would still be our safe home.
---
I'll starting to like seeing my pet die for me.  I send it on obvious suicide missions.  "Keep those two elites busy while I mine."
---
yeah mages are the new huntards, terrible players who have gained elitism / fake ego out of nowhere because their class is insanely broken ported straight from TBC.
---
Tickle her only with the pet. The pet has only to be in melee range; don't let it attack and rather use the time to call it back with dash/dive macro
---
I'm not sure if you can server transfer to just anywhere, yet. However, there is a server that you can xfer to from Faerlina right now. So, if we traded that 50g or w/e next time your own, log on during a full pop time and while you're in que theres an option to move your character to a different server, for free.
---
What we prefer vs what is available without starting over from scratch. I'm good anywhere is the 60:40 ranges. Only way I get that is starting over new.
---
Isnt a massive leap in logic, its basic logic.
---
I have actually had phantom mail before when I just clicked open all, all the sudden everything started opening. I am an AH whore tho.
---
Tbh I've seen mages that can dumpster on every class. This is the select few players that can do this  though. This class has the utilities to actually be the best if you have a deep understanding of spell rotation and timing. It really depends on how good your opponent is vs. how good you are. The mage class has a variety of skills that make it one of the best imo. It really comes down to situational awareness and how good you are at understanding/comprehending situations and how to handle them.
---
Let me clarify this don't compare wow with real life for one reason i'm on of the people in wow who defined as asshole i ninja loot i gank low level i spit on players after i kill them i camp their corpses sometime i yell at people for fun and in real life i respect everyone and do nothing bad
---
A game is a game i love seeing other people rage it's entertainment for me,real life it break my heart to see someone suffer and i'll give them a hand and help
---
I'm a demon in video games an angel in real life,i play wow since 2008 i experienced everything and i did everything even got banned like 12 times for me  without drama rage video games are boring !! that's why i like wow and i'm addicted to it many assholes many memories ! i know i'll get like thousand of dislikes but who cares nobody like the truth.
---
And yes i play a rogue...hmm forsaken
---
you're on\*\*\*
---
&gt;  and if they don't want people needing gear that is good for them then they should stack the party with people that dont use the gear
---
It's almost like that's exactly what they are doing. Whether they fill slots with people who don't want the gear or they just reserve it from people who can use it, it's the same thing.
---
In the end no one's making you join a group with reservations.
---
I use recount. If you right click on the title bar you can shift from damage done to a few dozen metrics. The three most important IMO are: Damage Taken, Interrupts, and Deaths (So you can see what killed someone).
---
Sweet a wand with saddlebags.
---
Yeah it is my opinion. I wouldn't have posted it if it wasn't.
---
This has been happening to me since day one and I'm so tired of it. I don't know how many times I need to report it for it to be noticed.
---
Play Arcane? It's kind of their entire thing.
---
Like I'm pretty much a boomer when it comes to video games meaning I don't know much about them at all
---
&gt; you need to stack MP5 for sustain instead of Spirit
---
Yes and no. Shaman get an unusually low return on Spirit (20% rather than 25% for Priests/Mages) and do not have a 15% mana regen (or 30% with set bonus) talent for Spirit. Priests additionally receive spellpower from Spirit. As a result, Spirit only exceeds the value of mp5 when your FSR time is less than 20% (iirc - I'd need to redo the math to give a more precise answer) while this number would be 75%/90% for Priests with and without their raid set bonus.
---
Innervate is also an issue, but the likelihood that an Innervate will be used on a Shaman is low.
---
However, the real question is whether mp5 is worth it in comparison to *+healing*. To which the answer is 'normally no'. If you're casting Healing Wave less than once every ~8 sec, then mp5 is better. Otherwise, +healing is better. Since the only time you really need mana regeneration is in intensive fights - the kinds of fights where you cast a lot more than once every 8 sec - this tends to mean +healing beats +mp5.
---
Downranking (as well as additional spells in your mix) complicates this somewhat. But to reach the point where you can institute the classic HW1/HW10 mix, you need ~+275 healing. To reach HW1/HW8, you need ~+475 healing.
---
That doesn't leave a whole lot of room for mp5 - and it's why the "BiS" lists that layer on mp5 tend to underperform those that emphasize raw +healing in terms of sustained healing output.
---
The other alternative to mp5 is Intelligence. A single point of mp5 has an itemization cost of 2.5 while a single point of Intelligence has an itemization cost of 1. Comparable gearing would be 15 * 2.5 * 1.05 = 39.4 mana for Intelligence, which requires 197 secs to replace with mp5. (Intelligence also increases your throughput by ~0.02% and a trivial fraction of Ancestral Healing uptime, neither of which are likely to prove significant).
---
The question then becomes: how many fights exist where the 197 sec barrier is meaningful? I'd argue "precious few" (at least in Classic). The only time you see fights this long is in raids and fights that long are normally fights with phases that don't have particularly high sustained healing demands.
---
Note: All the above requires comparable gear. Because high iLvl purples have a larger itemization budget, you rapidly move from selecting gear based on stats (pre-raid) to being forced to accept whatever stats you're given on your raid sets. However, knowing the balance of stats still matters for neck/ring/trinket/weapon/off-hand slots.
---
Just because you can be an asshole, does not mean you should be an asshole.
---
23th....
---
Orc smash?
---
Well, for one there was the *Wall of No* that was circulating the WoW forums.
---
I don’t tank.
---
Yeah! Equal lefts *and* rights!
---
Nice my dude, again. Your opinion, no one probably gives a shit? Other than you.
---
I actually disagree. Your primary stat should be agility, then spirit. Stamina doesn't do anything to help you since your pet is the one taking hits. On the other hand, spirit gives you essentially more HP and mana over time. This means you can farm for longer without breaks, and use more spells or take damage more frequently.
---
The one important trick, however, is to be careful about spamming abilities like Arcane Shot. Every time you spend mana, you stop regenerating for 5 seconds. If the mob is close to death, you should avoid spending mana so you can start regenerating sooner and get more mana back between kills.
---
As a horde player, I suspect horde outnumbers alliance on blameaux. The stereotype is that horde players use less addons like census plus and thus the numbers are skewed towards alliance.
---
Do you think princess runs bring in more gold than farming bats in eastern plague lands?
---
Fleshlight has really outdone itself.
---
Imagine believing this
---
If you want to get real nerdy, think about overkill.  If you crit something when it’s at 1% all that crit damage is wasted
---
This is not true. The first point in the talent let's you block an additional hit, the next 2 points only increase the duration, it doesnt make you block more hits.
---
To min max you only put one point into this talent as the other points are largely wasted.
---
I actually don't care about horde or alliance. I do enjoy ganking people though.  If I could pick a third separate faction and gank both sides, I would do that for sure.
---
Is this real life?
---
I dont use it but i guess its good for abilities you have to cast since you cant move during them anyway
---
It says ride the boys? I’m 28.
---
Cower should just be replaced with "play dead" which is a pet version of FD because cower sucks ass and that ability would still be situational at best.
---
Change my mind.
---
U need a mouseover macro
---
Go play on a PvE server then and quit whining about the mechanics Blizzard put in the game on PvP servers.
---
Well, I do mark, and I was talking about after explicitly asking him to hit skull-&gt;x and straight up refused. That's only happened once to that degree though.
---
And yeah, I get that, but it doesnt really matter at the end of the pull when you have rage and threat and stuff already. It really doesnt matter (for the most part) if a rogue pulls aggro after the first half of the the pull, worst case if taunt is resisted you have to pop evasion. If it happens at the start you kind just cant get threat back because nothing is hitting you and everyones hitting everything
---
Half of the 264 are alts and this pic was taken at noon server time. Come 7pm I have 60 people online :)
---
Make an intro with unregistered hypercam 2, use movie maker animations, max. 15fps recording, Fort Minor - Remember the name, close up RP-walking, scale down to 1024x768 or 800x600.
---
Never regretting re-rolling as a Druid. I’m on Thunderfury if you need a good tank.
---
Are you talking about BM hunters and the frenzy talent?  You don't want to be that spec for pve.  
---
Attack speed is good for pet tanking while you level up because if you have a pet with a 3sec atk speed and they miss an attack that's a long time to wait for them to start generating aggro.  Also when you use intimidate you want it to go off sooner than later.
---
For dungeons and raids though attack speed is irrelevant.  It's just math.  They either attack slowly and hit hard or attack fast and hit soft.  The dps is the same either way.
---
The thing that annoys me the most about asmongold is that he is famous for literally exploiting the game and the people in it to boost him self up. A nice helm drops in a raid he wont think twice to ninja it from everyone, even his friends, and the weirdest part is people like it! they just continue to trade him and give him gold for no reason. lol
---
I did it last night and died like 10 times, but I got the mallet.
---
I die like crazy on a mage. Never got the hang of it. On Retail it's just fine, but Vanilla/Classic? I'm dirt napping constantly. Can't do it. 
---
I personally found lock to be a better fit. Whether it's due to pets, drain life, a bigger health pool, soulstones, or all of the above, I can get out of most scrapes just fine...even full hp usually. I know mages also have their own set of tools and escapes, but they just didn't work so great for me.
---
I wish they did, because I would play the hell out a magic class that also has blink, portals, sheep, an intellect buff, and free water. I would fucking *love* that toon. I just can't stay alive long enough to level it.
---
In the meantime I'll just have to make mage besties.
---
Cool thanks
---
Wait is that real? Is such a mechanic in Retail? Or was that a joke
---
I heard Darcy yelling the other day while using this path to swim down to STV. I made a small detour and, yep, there was a Paladin having just killed the first wave of Defias. I stuck around and wiped the next two waves for him, because I remember how much that quest sucked.
---
...Man does that quest suck. Fantastic reward, though.
---
You know how it's fun to hang out with friends on the couch, watching TV or playing a video game?
---
Streaming is like that, but for kids who don't have friends or leave their houses. It's about enjoying media while feeling a sense of community. Obviously it's nowhere near as good as *actual* friends, but there are also elements of stargazing (watching famous people) and slot-machine-esque rewards (put in a coin, get pretty visual effects and attention from other viewers/the streamer).
---
start prot, into arms, into fury
---
This is a build that maximizes survivability with low gear.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#Lq0xzZVZxizseMzVo
---
As you progressively get better gear towards 60, you'll want to swap to something that deals more damage and generates more threat. Like Impale tank:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LchxzhbZcZxizoeMzVo
---
This generates more threat and does more damage at the cost of the survivability and utility talents.
---
They did during BC during Quel'danas, WotLK/Cata as well for various things.
---
Again. One is a video game. One is real life.  If you cannot distinguish between the two, then idk what to tell you.
---
A joke with the current patch.
---
Well, if the first thing you think of when you see daisy dukes is "wank material" then yeah I'd say you're probably a pedophile. There is no strawman here, unless you're denying that you think everyone who likes daisy dukes just wants to jerk it? And that you *don't* think people who wear these shorts are slutty? Because if that's the case you've got some comments to delete my guy.
---
Depends. missilies is more mana efficient but frostbolt is often more dps, depends on ranks and gear ofc, find out for yourself.

You're doing an awfully good job at avoiding me then lol.
---
I had this rogue screaming at me in chat because I wouldn't AoE every pull when we were pulling 2-3 mobs at a time, claiming I was wasting their time.  He could not wrap his head around the fact that it would be slower because I'd have to drink after almost every pull rather than just everyone attacking the same mob at the same time.  Dude raged and left and proceeded to spam whisper shit talk me and when I tried to reply it said he ignored me lmao.
---
Bought game time instead of a sub. It runs out at the weekend. Cos game time cards are awkward I have £5 sitting in battle net but would need to buy another £15 game card to use it. That would give me two months of play. 
---
Unfortunately we’re broke, and I can’t use mum’s credit card 15 years later. Her oft repeated words of “we aren’t spending that money on a game!” finally make sense as an adult with little mouths to feed. I’ll come back when we have the disposable cash. 
---
Anyways, would resub if I could. This is a good game. Hope they continue to do well.
---
Same. The off hand orb is just as bad and further in ST.

Or out of LoS (line of sight)
---
That’s all fair feedback, thanks for watching and responding!

Nice! I had a similar experience with a twist... 
---
Waiting for my guildie to arrive to do the elite kill, a group of ally proceeds to spawn him. I ended up charging the mob to help out and one of them think I was trying to gank, I /cry and die. They then emote for me to do the elite kill when I respawn, mid-fight my guildie finally arrives and wipes them all out not knowing they were helping. Thanks / sorry, ally group on Skeram &lt;3

I'm pretty sure it's a testimony to how much certain people opposed the idea of Classic WoW.

Just look at the lvls for dungeons and when u get to that lvl and want to do the dungeon, go do the dungeon. Ask people to share the sharable quests with you and then if u want to get the non-sharable ones go get them
---
Absolutely. If I see a DPS who is ripping up the damage meters, I sleep. If I see a DPS who is competing with me for interrupts, that's real shit.
---
I was leveling a mage alt through ZF and stopped because the quality of pugs is so low compared to a couple weeks ago. Almost everyone good is 60. Now these spellcleave groups have mages that just blizzard and afk instead of a nova rotation, CoC, and AE.
---
(blizzard should be 20-30% of your dmg in spellcleave - if it’s 80% of your dmg you’re doing it wrong)
---
Also, what is up with so many random people just popping up out of nowhere expecting an invite ( when you already are grouped) like its some god given right when you have 3 named quest targets and already killed 2 and are in the middle of killing the third?  I hate it when some rando scrambles out of nowhere going "INV"!  No dude, we already killed the other ones, and if we let you in now, you'll expect us to wait and do it all again. Deal with the fact that this one is already done, and you're just gonna have to wait. Next time, get a group sooner.
---
Wtf does that even mean
---
Brees is goat
---
Classic Plus please for the love of god.
---
This is best one: Cone of cold at point blank when no threat has been generated so mobs instant-switch aggro and 1-shot before you can even Nova or Blink out.
---
I agree completely.  If you already missed the boat, don't sweat it.  Better things to do at 60 than level a pet!
---
let's hear what you would do as a rogue vs a frost mage then.
---
my guild gave me a years subscription. I'm set.
---
The dungeon here would just be an obscene amount of silithid. You'd have to travel through their crampt, unlit caverns made of their own weird insect chitin, and eventually face off against their hivemother in a huge room that was her. she is the room. She's like, have silithid come out of tubes in the wall and swarm everything, her little legs and stuff twitching on the ceiling, and stuff.
---
some say he’s still swimming to this day
---
Yes. They’ve been broken for 15 years...
---
No they didn't. 
---
We just had a hard time in SW. T5 was just a dream for us with arc-frost (2xT5 parts) and fire being among top DPS. We shined during T6 as well : mobility on Archimonde, tanking Illidari council, deep frost + arc-frost duo on Illidan, threath reset on Gurtogg... Saying mage sucked during the extension is just disrespecting other classes. 
---
Not mentionning the PvP kit we had back then was just an outrageous upgrade of an already unbalanced kit we had in vanilla. It's just drood and locks had an amazing synergy in arena, but mages were still in an over-average position when it comes to TBC PvP.
---
I'm saying both your opinion of movies and WoW are subjective.

I did MC last night and the mages were competing for dispells.  It was fun to see.

You labor under the assumption I am “no changes”.  
---
My point is this is a chance to add things they were going to in Vanilla and didn’t for either technical or future expansion release reasons. People have assumed they would make yet another client for BC, so people who would rather stay on Vanilla can do so, yet can transfer their Classic character to the expansion. This could be an opportunity to have BC like content without actually releasing BC.  
---
Just a fool’s hope, I suppose.
---
fuckin arseholes
---
Read what I posted.
---
If your target is not the first kill target, you will have more than enough time to build up a huge threat lead, thus making MCP pointless.
---
MCP is only necessary if your target is the first kill target.

I just want to say that many of your points I would not tie to the BC expansion itself but a refinement of the game we would have seen regardless through patches.
---
I enjoyed the expansion when it came out but I would never want to replay it. I could play classic for literally the rest of my life and get enjoyment from it, but the only thing BC had going for it was the refinement of mechanics.
---
Just to clarify, defense stat does not directly contribute to stopping crushing blows as you are describing. Defense is used to directly stop crits though.
---
Crushing blows are stopped by your mitigation stats combined percentages, so defense does contribute indirectly since it increases those stats. You have to have enough dodge, parry and block to push crushing blows off the roll table enemies have when rolling to hit your character. Since druids can only get dodge, they cannot actually get enough of this mitigation to stop crushing blows from happening. 
---
Even if there was tons of defense gear available on leather pieces, druids would pretty much never be able to avoid crushing blows in classic
---
Tank needs to back down the nearby hallway, sheep one (don't try and sap unless your rogue is over-leveled).

Its really tough even if you know what you're doing though. If they drop 3 mines at the same time, oof.

I think the dungeon here would be the Horde and Alliance walking in on a HUGE terf feud in a massive cavern with lakes of lava and tons of mushrooms everywhere, between an Ogre clan who want a nice place to be alone, a ton of  fire and magma elementals that want in the hot lava pools, and the Dark Irons who want the large repository of ore and gems in there. The Horde and/or the Alliance would just come in there, clean house and take it for themselves. It'd look like the cave in Stonetalon Peak from WCIII iirc.
---
In dungeons bears aren't a problem.
---
But in a raid where the single target boss is pounding the bear into pulp, it's not really about aggro. It's because of the low defense problem of the bear.
---
Yeah, the healer can keep them alive. But it's harder.
---
And when 9/10 of the runs are with a warrior tank. Everyone notices the difficulty spike with the druid so much more.
---
A bear can tank, but it's harder and pugs like won't often like you.

It's one of [these](https://thumbs.worthpoint.com/zoom/images1/1/0518/02/vintage-school-teachers-wood-line_1_87f5fa2764220152ab505f7af013143f.jpg) things but for wands
---
You will want 2 sets.  A damage set focused on strength and stamina that is mostly if not all Mail or plate, and a healing set that is a mishmash of all armour types that focuses on int.  
---
There are several viable specs once you reach 40, but the commonly suggested build pre-40 is Seal of Command.  This will slightly beat a SoR build for damage, but it’s really your choice.  I would avoid Prot tree until 40 unless you really want the 3% hit/imp freedom/BoK.
---
My advice is to read a couple paladin guides, read all the spells and talents, and decide what **You** want to do.  My 60 build is going to be a 25/26/0 reckoning/SoR build for solo and a bunch of healing talents for dungeons raids.   Currently at 46 I’m 26/11/0 with the majority in the healing talents.
---
Portals.
---
Gift of arthas makes that not true
---
On the plus side i dont have adrenal glands so thats not an issue. 
---
Yea the migraines were from my 24 hr no sleep work schedule and having a baby, not wow. But they did hit again recently im sure because of wow. I know its not good, i probably have some lasting effects including the new onset migraines and constant head pain. Im now trying to use moderation.
---
yea barrens is not a contested zone, so you can't kill horde players unless they are flagged for pvp.. so you have to rely on nice hordlers to let you tame eche :D
---
I put it there whenever i head out. Usually, thats my Wand button :)
---
I wish my daddy had as much swag as you D:
---
If you are a human, ideally you should use 2h mace or sword. But when you are leveling, it doesn't matter that much.
---
I would recommend Orc Crusher from a quest in Redridge which you can get around level 20 or so.
---
This , I have been invited to so many 5 mans that have another mage already because they want us to nova, cone, bliz huge packs. Sometimes it’s fine. It’s all about knowing when to focus and when it’s ok to bliz.
---
Gift of arthas makes attack speed more desirable
---
Rage management is key for tanking. Don't spend all your rage every pull try to end most pulls with 30 or 40 rage. The healer can drink while your rage slowly decays. If the healer is 50% or more mana go ahead and pull
---
I feel like I have been hearing that a lot lately and should probably heed the advice haha. Think I will take the points out of coc to max our blizz / permafrost and either arctic reach or meditation. Thanks for the feedback!
---
It's like the Jedi class was in Star Wars Galaxies. Just miles ahead of everyone else. The Blizz developers even referenced it back then talking about how WoW would be better: "MMO Design 101: don't make a God-class".
---
Here we are in 2019, and theres a clear God-class...
---
Hahahaha item level hahahahahahahahaha
---
That's an expansion I skipped due to my studies. I did play the pre-patch though. I know it was then that talents trees were removed if I remember correctly.
---
Your armor value doesn't really matter in raids. You pretty much have to use cloth just like pallies and resto druid do all the time.
---
Take off taunt
---
Dismiss when jumping down with the group
---
You can whistle pet back after this
---
Need on agility upgrades
---
Dps melee weapons are not always ur friend
---
You only want melee weapons as agility upgrades
---
Mage hate so strong right now - except if I was a rogue I could do the exact same thing any people would call me a pro.
---
You can tank most every instance without a shield, its around Sunken Temple and BRD that enemies start to hit fairly hard
---
Obviously this doesnt apply to you then. Hes reffering to warriors who are applying to groups as tanks, but wont go sword n board for a situation that requires such.
---
In Ragnarok Online this was a real Rogue ability, Plagiarize. Clearly the tank is a veteran of old Korean grindathon MMOs.
---
Well fuck I hope you're wrong. I haven't tried yet but that was my plan at 60 lol.
---
I'm a rogue too and going thru the same bs. Some guy kicked me out of a party twice since he said he wanted an mage for the AoE for a quick run. Yet he wastes 20 mins trying to get a mage lmao
---
Someone took the name Ryoko on multiple servers so I had to go with Ryohko since I was sub rogue it worked out.
---
Then I randomly /whoed Ryoko and they were the exact same lv as me but a different class.
---
🤣
---
Its a 4 day CD. I didnt have time to make more than 3, and I sold my first one.
---
Making all the cloth myself would have taken 40 days, and I couldnt be arsed to wait when i had the money available.
---
In no guide is agility the top stat for warriors. It's useful, yes. Agility is by far the top stat for Rogue.  
---
Of course your friend can roll on an Agility cloak and use it. Would he get as much value from the Rogue using it? No. It's the same reason why a Rogue would get flamed for needing a mage dagger that was a big upgrade. Weapon DPS is king for Rogues. But the mage would get more value from it. Doesn't mean the Rogue can't use it, it's just that it would benefit the Mage more.
---
We have cyborg ninjas in overwatch. No one is disabled in the future, so we can hate freely
---
Luna unit frames and Bartender action bars.
---
I usually pop renew on the locks before I sit to drink. I don't heal locks until they hit about 30 percent health, and my rotation for that is bubble, renew, flash heal, back to tank.
---
you are correct, I am on herod and it seems to be very weird like that. I'm in a HUGE guild and while it's happening way less now, at the start like every hour or so you'd see a mass of people log out at once, then a mass of people log in at once lol. It was nuts. The guild spam from all the people logging was so crazy.
---
It also just randomly dissconnected me on my bank alt. i try to talk to a npc now instead of just jump.
---
I hope I will find small pvp guild, Coz its just like you said 20ppl guild can be so much tighter.
---
It's pretty nice
---
Pet primary stats are normalized, but attack speed isn't. BT is still the king, although King B and his baked-in Cobra Reflexes is a nice budget choice.
---
Mom said it’s my turn to post spellcleave karma farm tonight
---
Yep.  I don't even have the option to select classic.  It's retail or PTR.
---
Best comment award
---
is that just the crit chance and armor boost?
---
So I lined my wife up to play mage this xpac because it's an in demand class with a doable pve rotation if she actually ever makes it into a raid for fun.
---
This bs meta has her thinking I set her up for failure. "Nobody leaves my sheep alone." "Every other person is a mage." "I got kicked from that group because I wasn't aoeing how this other mage thought I should on the first pull."
---
This environment is awful for a noob mage - nobody has the time to help her learn how to play the class or forgive her for a mistake in those stupid AOE cleave groups and those that want her to play it in a more 'classic' fashion are just outnumbered/hard to come upon. She has the best time in groups where CC is marked and she can focus dps. It's sad because honestly I'm proud of her performance in those runs and it makes me sad when she gets beat up/kicked out for failing this absurd aoe meta. She's just too new to be proficient at making friends to group with and avoiding 'bad' groups - I hope she hangs in there!
---
Dwarf and Gnome women are thicc
---
An alliance and I ran next to each other through feralas on our mounts, jumping off things and doing 360s and laughing at each other. When we parted ways we waved goodbye. It was nice and lighthearted and we both had a fun time.
---
Pvp has its place in the world. Being a dick just to flex your epeen can at least wait until the honor system arrives.
---
Same blizzard subscription. Different characters
---
&gt;It’s not a healthy mindset to have about female characters or women in general, and alienates a part of the fan base
---
Ah yes, I forgot that we live in an age where the artists have to tell everyone how to feel and interpret things. Also what part of the fanbase are you talking about? The prudes who report people in general chat for saying fuck?
---
Please contact the FBI and blizzard.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Yeppers! Glad others read blue posts/know how to use google too haha
---
For the twink items it definitely depends on pvp being out, because there will be a huge uptick of people all of a sudden googling twinking and looking at what items they need when the time comes. Not a lot of people plan this far ahead for that type of thing.
---
What is this? I don't really frequent the wow forums so I'm out of the loop here.
---
Yep, I ways whisper locks in dungeons and say hey, if I pop renew on you at full health, it's because I see you're low on mana, so do your thing, I'm not healing you because I misclicked.
---
I think I fudged the title looking at it. I tanked every dungeon I participated in atleast once. Not every time I ran the dungeon :)
---
Gotta let em power up to 100% that way when you win it'll demormalize em.

---
Sylvanas is a badass
---
The talent trees have indeed been removed, and I support the change. It is more endgame friendly, talent trees were extremely fun to level with, doing hybrid specs, etc. But my problem with them is that when it comes to endgame, the talent trees flexibility doesnt matter because you will look up the best build on the internet anyways and go with it. But there is a problem that Blizzard doesn't seem to give a fuck anymore since we should have talents for 110 and 120 and whatever comes next.
---
Sad to see horde using phones for simple screen shots. And a shaman no less
---
Prot warrior, rogue, and priest mainly. God i love the warlock sets. Its such a shame they are so bad.
---
exactly you are supporting my point
---
I’ve been enjoying bear tanking on bloodsail. Ive been starting to only run guild groups though. I’ll die several times and have a blast if everyone communicates and tries to get better.
---
This is the sort of thinking that gets people banned from twitch for saying "Naga"
---
Then https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10418/glimmering-mithril-insignia
---
Well that is a basic thing. Inst like modern wow where pull means big dick dps. There's not much you can do with 5 people unless you do it with that group regularly, which is rare for me.
---
I spent 250g on a Krol Blade at level 51 and I don't regret a single gold of it. Nothing in this game gives you more satisfaction than getting an item you long for. Gratz on your vest ;)
---
ok that is where the confusion is coming from. You made an alt not an alt account.
---
dont forget to use a condom
---
What will really surprise you is when you realize that the massive bear is actually tiny, as its shorter than the dwarf.
---
More of a chain really
---
Why is this a huge problem?
---
That’s a huge accomplishment. Congrats!
---
Do they have target dummies in classic or was that added later?
---
So what are we changing Naga to? Sounds too close to a racial slur and we are super sensitive.
---
20 man ganking raids
---
Blizzard blessed us with assorted shapes and colors and this is how we thank them?
---
Real shame
---
Got mine last night on Smolderweb. Nice Rogue and Druid kind enough to let me try the bad boy out. Real champs. XD
---
ty..,.,., fuck,,.,. I left the others bc i figured you had already figured them out urself I intend to add to it later
---
What do you mean dude? Dedicate your entire day to ganking their pet you filthy casual
---
lock does not need heal. healers just our presonal manna pools.
---
small indie company
---
Tried mine, died twice, kept at it cause I know this how I get my pally hammer. Another pally showed up and we teamed up, barely made it. For the Light!!! I was lvl 23 at the time, currently lvl 35 and still using it. For a pally weapon it does unholy amounts of dmg lol.
---
Related: when Ice Crown Citidel came out i was Feral DPS. 4 piece t10 was a _huge_ upgrade for feral and I got it ASAP. I jumped to the top of damage meters (I was doing ~9500 dps compared to the DK in 2nd at ~8700). Only problem was: i had a shit weapon. I think the "tanking" staff from 10 man. Didn't matter, still top dps. 
---
Then after what seemed like forever (10-12 kills I'm sure) Festergut finally dropped the BiS staff. I was so excited and the DK PM'd me "FINALLY!!!". But then loot council gave it to the tank. Because I already did enough damage.
---
And that was the day I left my guild :-/
---
The fact is that 99% of these people (all of us) will never reach the dps charts of a top tier raid group where these numbers will matter. And I'm pretty sure almost every raid can be cleared with half-geared people anyways, so a random boomkin or prot pally won't make or break. 
---
Personally I think trying to raid with weird specs would make more challenging fun anyways, it would add handicaps to an otherwise easy collection of raids.
---
If by eagle eye you mean only players in your immediate vicinity (ie are rendered) then yes, it does precisely that.
---
Pirated copy and too lazy to torrent a new activator.  The message has been there for years and I dont even notice it now.
---
Off with ye!
---
Most under appreciated comment.
---
Might just be me, but I had to give up on the levelling guide for the same reason I have a problem with this — the map doesn't work consistently for me. I choose Horde and get a thing saying "Pick Up: Warlord's Command" and a quest indicator on a big grey square. 
---
Safari Version 13.0 (14608.1.49) on macOS 10.14.6, FWIW.

Edit: Does work for me in Chrome.
---
I've done it before for a few quests when I've been too lazy to get out of bed.
---
I use a XBOX360 controller with XPadder to map various mouse/keyboard bindings to the controller buttons.
---
It's relatively easy to do some simple quests or farm a few mobs, but I wouldn't attempt PvP or anything too serious with it.
---
They're called lepers.
---
&gt; And usually bears will be tanking the skull because they have better threat gen
---
Bears almost never tanked skull in my guild, that was usually the MT's job.
---
You are right about that! That different perspective is why I watched it in the first place. While I did say it wasnt a great video, it wasnt horrible either. I do hope you continue to make videos because you did have some very good talking points. We can always improve in all endeavors. Thank you for making it.
---
yes, and? how is that a problem?
---
Also harder/more expensive to upgrade!
---
I still have a few original components to my PC I built in 2008, all slowly upgraded.
---
This add on should be banned by blizzard. I personally ignore anyone that I see using the spy add on.
---
Is The seal of command trick a viable "taunt" on raid Bosses? Let say if The other tank tries to lower their threat?
---
Multiple guides deem it as a high priority. Wowhead to name one. Look it up.
---
Bottom line is people that don't wanna roll against other people need to create there own groups and state that they have priority on X piece of gear or weapon.
---
Wowhead - "For Warriors, Agility is quite an important stat, it strengthens your character in some ways, for tanking especially it provides you with armor, dodge, and even critical strike chance."
---
I'll let you do your own research though. You can feel how ever you want but facts are facts agility is incredible for prot warriors.
---
The weapon is to fast for it to be super useful for a warrior.
---
the quality of play in this subreddit is really low compared to somewhere like Fight Club
---
From this dungeon, hunters would gain an item. A chunk of the Hivemother's brain. You'd have to take it to a mage in the Plaguelands who would tell you that you can use to tame Silithid, but only if it was properly reanimated, and subjugated. You'd then go on a trip involving necromancy and magical mind-slave gems to get the item, and be able to tame silithid.
---
Well my prefered number. would be 50 so we can do city raids. but im more intrested to join cool people then what OP is saying
---
What server i need 1
---
It is not but it is funny.
---
Yeah you know, twentythreeth time
---
New player (never played wow, not even vanilla) 
---
My first character is a paladin and now i've reached lvl 10, so my question is where do i put my skill points in? I'd like to be a tank/healer but i've heard that ret paladin is bad and i should go only healer? How does it all work ?
---
Literally just explained why they would keep the 08 change. Appeal to a wider audience for more money, so yes it's deliberate
---
https://www.grammarly.com/blog/meta-meaning/
---
“In the world of gaming, meta is used in two ways. Meta can be used as an acronym for “most effective tactics available,” and calling something “meta” means that it’s an effective way to achieve the goal of the game, whether it’s to beat other players or beat the game itself. Meta can also be short for metagame, which is using information about the game, derived from the world beyond the game or its rules, to influence the outcome of the game or gain a competitive edge.”
---
Also, does it matter? I’m asking if it is actually a great strategy or not. I’m literally asking and trying to learn more about the game.
---
And we're in phase 1 ffs
---
Dude I’m sorry, you’re probably tired of hearing this, but what did you do for gold? I feel like I’ve been trying everything and being really careful and yet I only have 30g (after buying my first mount). Any advice would be much appreciate, but no worries if you cba haha. Congrats on the mount, I’m human too and that joint is my end-goal.
---
Yeah that's what I just got done discussing with my gf. Goose game would be more fun and interesting for a short period of time but only like a week max, maybe 3 days .. wow I'd be playing all month. More money worth out of wow, but wow comes with it's own uh.. problems [addicting]
---
You literally sound like me!
---
I'm trying to make an alt as well, but I have a level 35 Priest, so I don't really wanna do ranged DPS. I want to go rogue, but I don't wanna do sword rogue but I know backstab rogue is basically useless for leveling. I'm also no a PvE server because my friends are babies so I won't even get fun PvP things. Then DPS Paladin seemed cool but apparently you just right click then go AFK which sounds lame.
---
Then Hunter, but he seems more ranged DPS than melee. Then finally Warrior, but my friend is a warrior, I don't wanna tank, and the leveling looks like a nightmare. And I hate that druids aren't great at anything and I'll just be forced to heal anyways. So might as well just play my priest (who I do like a lot don't get me wrong).
---
Basically boils down to, I wanna be a shaman but that's no on alliance. And I don't want to have a character on a different side than all of my friends who play.
---
Like, ill stick around if the person's nice and they dont have far to go, but if you just started the quest youd best believe im not waiting around, nor would i expect anyone else to do otherwise
---
All this information from someone who called for a will of the forsaken out of poly in his own duel tournament.
---
LMAO, yes, the drinking aggro thing I've been most annoyed about this time around - yes, I'm sorry your rage is decreasing while you re waiting for me to take a drink, but you're also the reason I'm always low on mana....
---
Best class reward is hands down the Celestial Orb mage off-hand, which is still useful at endgame to refill some mana.
---
If you think blowing your entire mana pool aoeing the mobs I pulled and then waiting for you to drink every single fucking pull is somehow saving time, you're an idiot.
---
oh no
---
The only good reason to have different accounts is to be able to have  different instances of the game running at the same time (you can't do that with only one account).
---
Some people do it to play more chars of their own together, some other people do it to play the game with one account while playing the AH on the other one.
---
What conditions needs to happen to have a pet run away? Does it have to drop its loyalty to level one before it will happen? There seems to be like no info on the specifics anywhere.
---
Ayyy I have a hordie on Thunderfury. Need to work on her some more.
---
Lvl 2 PC in a contested zone is just asking to get ganked IMO.
---
The game also makes a pretty loud "dropped something into a bag noise" if you win
---
Now I’m not standing for the warrior as he was obviously stupid. But you saw that he didn’t have a shield and he was 44 which is basically the minimum required level for the dungeon, which is sometimes hard for average tanks WITH shields to do, generally I like to get a few levels up on the dungeon before tanking. These were your red flags and signs you should’ve recognized as a competent group leader. Basically this post can be summarized with:
---
“I invited a tank to my group who was not a tank and he wasn’t good at tanking” 
---
It’s not which class is the new huntards, it’s the fact that you invited bad players to your group because of lack of knowledge in the tanking department. Learn from it rather than complaining on reddit, learn what levels the TANKS need to be for the dungeons if they want to try 2h tanking. Because it’s a very different level requirement than a healer or caster for example. Or just don’t let someone do stupid shit if you don’t want stupid results.
---
Because of oversaturation of product, not because of the quality of each individual product.
---
You're saying 'thing bad' they're saying 'too much of a good thing is still too much' (to drastically oversimplify)
---
Imagine being so delusional you don't believe it. It doesn't surprise me that a neckbeard with no concept of how adults operate in the real world can't grasp this,
---
I bandage or just even out mana and health then eat and drink
---
Why is this in my controversial tab?
---
Because i could! It was clearly an alt i mean how else is there a level 2 on BB, shameful would be camping or going out of my way to low level zones to kill them this was a level 2 at a 35 zone so i just had to
---
Such a pain to start your own group....really.  You can fill the DPS spots, pretty damn quick.  Filling the healer spot will take time, but quicker than the tank spot.
---
All-in-all, you're looking at a minimum of 20 minutes to build a group...realistically, 30-45 minutes.....
---
I'd rather just go level fishing for 45 minutes, while spamming the LFG channel that I'm looking for group.
---
It came in tbc and cost 1k to unlock. I'd be fine with paying the 1k even, which is valued much more in classic.
---
Guess that wowhead is wrong then.
---
Thank you all for the replies guys.
---
I don't disagree, but do you care to elaborate? For myself the deus ex machina with the Lich King at the end was super lame, and partially tarnished the story.
---
To answer your question, no, the Hinterland Elite quests cannot be done in a raid group. The mallet, though, has no quest tied to it
---
Never try to kill the pet. At most just polymorph it. Keep hunter close to you at all times so they can't use ranged attacks.
---
I bought a PC from a local store. Had good spec's and I didn't feel confident to build my own. It had Windows 7. 
---
Then I upgraded to a SSD and ported everything over. Still Win7
---
Then I got a forced upgrade to Win8. Then again to Win10. Now it pops up with that error (or whatever). After awhile I got annoyed and decided to just buy Windows once and for all. Went through Microsoft's website but it wouldn't let me for some reason. I think because it thinks I have pirated Windows.
---
So that's my reason 🤷‍♂️
---
Are you familiar with the story of the tortoise and the hare? This makes literally no sense, unless you think hares hunt tortoises...
---
because "just blunts" might have raised the ESRB raiting.
---
What do you describe as low level? I'm still tankingm ore effectively with a 2h vs Shield at mid 40s. And I can assure you I'm not that good.
---
Can we stop posting this same sentiment 20 times a day?
---
.. because i want to kill other players when i feel like it, as well as experience getting ganked every now and then
---
faction doesnt make a difference to me
---
&gt;I've come to the conclusion that mages and warriors are the new huntards.
---
Don't you fucking dare. You don't know how hard I struggled to get to 60 without leveling first aid. Don't group me in the "huntard" group.
---
Imagine how boring you must be that a dwarf drinking water is more intimidating than you.
---
Skeram
---
Ah maybe I did it cuz everyone is still undergeared.  a druid in full blues basically better than a warrior in full blues since you've  hit your powerspike and you're not gonna get too many more upgrades out of MC vs a warrior who's only gonna get beefier through MC gear.
---
You do you booboo. That's all that matters
---
You are right, mate, I am with you. Still lvl 36 and having a lot of fun.
---
As a healer just know I fucking hate all of you
---
DHs getting Fury for interrupting is similarly clever. Gotta incentivize it if you want them to do anything other than faceroll.
---
My buddy and I once made 2 UD rogues, got them to 20, made a guild called Redridge Raiders and took them to Red Ridge. Allys never expected to get attacked by 2 rogues (who arent lvl ??). It was great fun, usually after a bit we would see the 60s come in, then its time to hide!
---
We spent a great deal of time on our ally mains (dif server) scouting RR for the best hiding and ambush spots. I even bought an atlas of azeroth, which I still have and honestly is insanely helpful haha.
---
Hmmm maybe I'll try that
---
Hmmm... Healsluts is leaking.
---
\*ba dum tiss\*
---
Do you absolutely need priest or could a druid heal?
---
Are you me? I’m in the exact same boat and it’s time to pick between the two. Commenting to check for a real answer to this.
---
Which addon do you use for your UI?
---
Human Females &gt; Night Elf Females &gt; Human Males&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything else
---
What raid were you running without a mage? That sounds unrealistic.
---
The characters demanding water were from western Europe during the Iron Age. Gaul is correct.
---
Neat
---
I am so glad cleave groups aren't a thing on my server. They sound horrible.

Going to drop a Lofi Hip Hop album and use this as the cover art. Cool? Cool.

---
How much did you pay for the recipe? It’s annoying how people are camping it all day
---
I was mostly kidding. The simple fact is that plenty of men play female characters and enjoy gear that looks like this. There’s nothing wrong with that. 
---
There are also many pieces of gear that have much more coverage on a human female than they do on an orc male for example. Go to any starting zone and you’ll see male characters running around in essentially underwear where female characters are covered up much more. 
---
Also I’m not sure what’s unhealthy about enjoying looking at the opposite sex (or same sex, whatever you’re in to) in revealing gear or clothing. I’d argue that it’s almost unhealthy not to. There’s a difference between objectifying someone based on what they’re wearing (think having the mindset that women dressed in skimpy clothing are inviting people to grope them etc) and enjoying what nature intends you to be attracted to.
---
Don’t some feminists think it’s unfair that they have to cover up more of themselves then men do?
---
Edit: and let’s be real. We live in an age where a 6 year old boy can google women in any stage of undress or sexual act they want. Animated plate bras are the least of your problems if you’re worried about the objectification of women in society.
---
Hi Arin
---
How does this work, never heard of this. Just run the eye in and it dies? What's the benefit?
---
i know a lot of warriors who basically did not step outside an instance once hitting 30. it was SM runs into RFD into ZF gy farm and then one or two ST until you hit brd and then its endgame.
---
She should stop joining "aoe group LF mage" type of groups if she's opposed to it, or instead of relying on other players to try and teach her why don't you?
---
if you're tanking with a shield in 5mans you're bad 
---
unless you want to roleplay or something then gl dude
---
You're arguing against yourself... I agree that agility is a fine stat for warriors. It's simply not the #1 stat by far like it is for rogues. The Rogue simply gains more from the item, it's that plain and simple. You can roll on it and use it, sure. It's just common courtesy to let people have priority when the item benefits them more.
---

That's how it generally goes, supplies almost always cost more than the product. The few exceptions are things like the Lionheart Helm, which is probably still rare enough that it's a license to print money.

Wow, an awesome answer! You kinda sold me on Hunters! I do feel you with the current aoe dungeon spam meta a few classes have been left out. A bit saddening, but there are many normal groups out there too. Other than that, Hunters seem a perfect match for me.

Yea!

The only pretty I've ever lost was the wolf I tamed to grind while waiting for a different one to spawn. I fed it once and it took almost two hours for it to run

wrong place to ask this question, this sub is just a casual circlejerk
---
You can mark a caster or a particularly dangerous enemy as skull.  Just ignore it and let the DPS focus it down, using their cooldowns and stuns to keep it under control. Take that time to get aggro on everything else so when skull is down and they start doing whatever, you have solid aggro.  
---
Let’s the DPS throw up their big numbers and hopefully develop an eye for interrupting stuff and gives you time to do your job.
---
Until you hit 60 then you most certainly have a spec
---
Plenty of people dislike plenty of things. Doesn't mean there isn't a market for those things. I'm not about to shove a dildo in my ass anytime soon, but there are plenty of people out there who want them. Anyone who can't imagine certain products are viable even if they aren't specifically tailored to them, is an idiot.
---
But the hare is faster so it must be the winner... /s
---
I can't speak much on Paladins, though I have seen that Ret Paladin is how you should level which makes tanking harder.
---
But my main is a level 35 priest and I can say priest is REALLY fun. You level as a shadow priest, meaning while leveling you are playing a ranged DPS. You get big numbers off smite and mind blast, you have high sustain, and you have a LOT of utility spells for specific situations that don't make it feel like you are just AFK in combat.
---
Then you can do dungeons, where you run healer. You have multiple types of heals early, dispels, and buffs. 
---
So it keeps things fresh. Bored of being DPS? go heal in a dungeon. Bored of healing? Go do DPS questing. I'm trying to find an Alt myself but only because I'm an altoholic, not because Priest isn't great.
---
Priest is a LOT of fun, and after I made my priest I couldn't go back to my Warlock anymore because I felt like I got to make so many more decisions moment-to-moment as the priest.
---
this subreddit is full of retarded players who hate spellcleave but join spellcleave groups. There are plenty of non spellcleave groups
---
We got several alts and lowbies their ZF mallets about a week ago. 
---
Summon to kill first boss. Kill in a raid. Loot the hammer. Summon to safe spot in a nearby lake. Take a few higher levels to Jintha’Alor. Kill the mobs. Summon lowbies. Make ZF mallets. 
---
Hearth to ogrimmar. Summon lowbies (a few hearthed after getting the hammer and before making it a mallet) again. 
---
As one of the two warlocks, I easily used 30+ soul stones just to do all of this. It was tons of fun though.
---
no think just pull gogogogogogogogogogogogogogo
---
edit: actually, to be honest, it's mostly during the day and early evening that these types are active. older/more experienced players  understand what the tank is doing. at least, that's been my experience so far in classic
---
Why did you even bother with the CDs though
---
Lol. You are the definition of ignorant. "OH IM SO COOL IDK WHO STREAMERS ARE I DONT WATCH THEM SO IM BETTER THAN EVERYONE"
---
I don’t get it... can PVP not be top tier on a pserver?
---
It's not about anomymity, it's about the context as a game. Games are spaces where the conceit of the separate virtual world allows for experimentation with (anti)social behaviors in an environment where the stakes are very low. This can allow people to safely express a side of themselves that isn't possible or acceptable in meatspace.
---
I don't play with a strong competitive mindset but that doesn't mean people who do are wrong, and in fact I'd go so far as to say that having some proportion of players who are competitive/disruptive to interact with enhances my experience.
---
Very good point

I've always wanted to commission an art piece and I saw this as a perfect opportunity. Here's my character healing Molten Core.

---
There will surely be very big guilds in the near future that will have enough players to run flexible raid schedules.  Try and find one of these and you should be able to land a spot no problem.  Of course since the game has only been out for 1 month, it appears that the only guilds raiding right now are the strict, super hardcore ones.  Because they are.  Give it some time, get some UBRS/scholo/strat gear, work your way into it.
---
On behalf of warriors that tank and love to tank. I've always had a shield. When I use to be a NE rogue in Vanilla I knew to use feint to manage my threat. Hell I even had it as a part of my normal rotation.

Sorry I just saw your reply, here's the timestamped video I was talking about.

After you go gnomish you can make all the items then drop engineering, level it again and go goblin for the sweet sweet ‘nades.
---
60
---
I'm fine with that, but warriors not even owning a shield are the worst.
---
Blizzard is mandatory. If you are a mage and not spamming blizzard gtfo.
---
If someone is in range to kill my pet, they are in range for an aimed shot.
---
I went straight holy and it was great. I had no issues healing whatsoever and as long as you get mage water when you log in you can burn mobs while leveling. A lot of people make it out like it's not efficient but once you get holy shock and a few tanks in consecrate you own everything and cant die lol.
---
Rolled on Grobbulus specifically for the wpvp, as RP-PVP realms have historically been nicely faction balanced with a slight Alliance bias and plenty of people who like to fight.
---
I am currently a Shaman. I am wanting to make a 2nd character and for it to be a Druid. But I don’t want to be healing at lvl 60 on both characters. Do raid groups accept Druid tank or dps?
---
Now? For 15 years they havent
---
The point of the frost spec'd mage casting fireball isn't the damage, though. It's the dot. To prevent bandaging and stealthing.
---
The point I'm making is that choosing a spec in classic, in many cases, doesn't remove access to utility and skills from the base class. Whereas in retail, each spec is effectively a complete class. they could divide the game into 34(?) classes at this point and it would feel about the same.
---
50 levels of dungeon grinding as priest i saw a single cc once on a pack due to tank derping out and dpa got bored.

Ppl 15 years later play grand master level by default.

Back in the day i was known from instantly taunt run away mobs.

As a mage main I support this post 1000%. Especially if those quotes are verbatim.

I noticed this same bug last night on my lowbie priest who just picked up enchanting.

Edit: I think it was the runed copper rod which also has the wrong on-hover text

Surprise is the whole point of an ambush. If you don't like PVP and the strategies that come with it then you shouldn't play on a PVP server.  This add on is game breaking garbage.
---
Fuck warlocks that life tap to 1hp when literally every other person is sitting and drinking.
---
Bluto you like to smash?
---
Came here to say this.
---
Weaponskill does influence them, though.
---
I remember you posted this few weeks ago 😁
---
I was doing a quest the other day there was a tauren war there, i put ff on his mobs to help out because leveling a war sucks and he threw a sunder on mine as he ran past. 
---
Everyone was happy until 2 undead locks ran in, i got a /sorry from the war as i died so that was nice :p
---
Ended up finishing the quest and stealth jumping the main lock twice just to be vindictive.
---
Cuz they havent been suspended for it yet
---
Never said anything about a marked target though, but in that case yes you're right
---
While I agree that mages are as busy as anyone else, they can also have just as much down time. While I wouldn't condone pestering anyone for anything, simply asking is not considered pestering and it is not my experience that there is anything wrong with that. If I personally don't want to give someone a portal, I can simply not respond or let them know I am busy and some other lucky mage can have any possible tip that player would offer.
---
We agree that mages should retain autonomy but we also think it is important that the public is educated about where their coin goes and the ethics involved.
---
Armor and other perks do matter.  I literally said the lack of gear is a significant part of spec issues and remedying that would go a long way.  Not that it's not required to wear cloth.
---
Just like how everyone should be required to work in a restaurant before the eat at 1 everyone should be required to play A Healer before they do a dungeon with one
---
Yes.  But it is way more active.  I used to do it while watching football.  Now you like actually have to kite rotgrip and princess it looks like.  Before it was just like set it and forget it

140g. How do you camp an instance?
---
Not to mention this is the first time I've seen warriors blamed for this AOE mess. Lol
---
its because its dirty cheap rn. having schools of fish early helps too. i have more than 100 stored
---
Generally speaking people who autoattack a lot like paladins to proc seals more often, some variants of shamans with their windfury or rockbiter (although even then slower is probably better), druids dont really care so in theory they can use them. 
---
Ive also found the faster 2hs tend to have proc effects themselves. Faster 2hs also tend to just be a middle ground between being more efficient at killing mobs without overkill like 1h weapons or spell interuptions, but also still having a little bit of burst that you find on the 2h weapons.
---
Horde are friendly when its convenient for them, not due to actual morals
---
I have it myself! Feral tank here o/
---
!remindMe 1 day
---
This is why its always best to run with a guild where everyone knows whats wanted. 
---
I had been wanting the ravager for my pally to help with Aoe lvling and I've passed on it 7 times, even to 1 tank (but he did such a great job, he deserved it. )
---
Its just Part of being a paladin. gear is short on hand
---
I’m lucky enough to have a strong guild group that I can do dungeons with, I would hate to rely on pugs for dungeon groups.
---
Selective reacting is funny too. I did full stratholme run some time ago with 4 people who were from the same guild. In living one of their guys got all 3 living orbs. Then towards end of ud part I won like 5 rare drops in greed roll in a row, because that's how RNG works. One of them then commented how I'm being so lucky. Bitch please, your dude just made 60g+ while I made 15g!
---
That's hilarious, I did the same with a group of hordies and camped them a couple times. Was great when they tried to call in backup and killed them too. Good times, good times
---
Just logged off Bigglesworth, now I gotta log back on to kill any Night Elf I see.
---
&gt; Imagine if every capital city has portals to every other city and you never have to go more than 2-4 places 
---
Wow a paradise? Instead of making me wasting hours of my life walking kilometers to no end, literally mechanics made to waste players time.
---
Do you think it had anything to do with the fact your other post blew up and made them look really bad? Lol
---
You know, rules and laws don't really stop people from doing things. It is the fear of punishment that does.
---
Likely these people either don't fear the punishment or don't care.
---
Cloack enchant stealth gives -2% aggro iirc, drops of bosses in aq40(emperors?). Nelf racial doesn't increase stealth, gives activable one. SotS doesn't exist in classic as far as i know. 
---
Think of it like skills in weapons, your level*5 is your stealth. MoD is 3 skill points (~60%) of lvl extra, which gives 5/5 3 lvls advantage.
---
Sweet! Glad they fixed it!
---

Interesting, thanks. I guess with an easy access keybind, you could be rather instant if you are just sitting there looking. I guess the screen would also have to be nearly realtime.

Right. All I’m saying is there is a time cost requirement to farm that gold that isn’t being accounted for.

idk two people back to back in an instance winnin 95% of greed rolls, against 4 other people, thats already such a slim chance, statistics feel pointless here. or maybe im bad at math.
---
Did they do sth bad doe ?
---
While I understand that your experience was a negative one, your anecdote is exactly the reason for announcements like ours. The player you interacted with has adopted what we in the Union of Mages see as an expectation of payment.
---
We seek to avoid this mentality becoming more dominant because of the hostility it breeds between mages and non-mages as well as the coutner-productive effects it has on income. This is not to even mention the slippery slope that leads to things like price fixing. The end result of this mindset is exactly the hostility you received. We want our abilities to remain a courtesy deserving of a reward and not a service to which the barrier of entry is gold.
---
I don't even understand the craze about spellcleave speed/power leveling. It goes against everything Classic is really for. When you really look at it, lvl 60 and endgame is pretty lackluster right now so why rush it by just spamming dungeon after dungeon  Enjoy the journey and adventure around the actual game. It's nice re-visiting places like Hillsbrad or Alterac instead of doing SM 100 times. If I wanted to level as fast as possible to play endgame content, I would stick to retail.
---
You are misunderstanding the intended buyers. 
---
Fiery War Axe is a big ticket level 39 twink item. A twink is a character that is min/maxed for PvP outside of the level 60 bracket. The items that a twink uses are highly sought after due to their rarity and usefulness in that specific bracket. 
---
I agree that at this stage in the game, nobody is going to pay 150g for a twink item. But they will in a couple months, guaranteed.
---
Happy you like them man, cheers :)

Haha how accommodating of them

No it's because you rolled on a fucking server named Old Blanchy, Sophia.

OH MY GOD, IT WAS! I'm having vivid flashbacks of making magical walls of fire while killing orcs.

Then you don't get to run dungeons as a tank, right? If you're not willing to put in an effort you can't reap the rewards of finding a group easily
---
As a warlock, how does +shadow damage effect healing from Drain Life and Siphon Life? Would I get more healing with generic spell damage and healing gear? Asking more for solo PvE and PvP not for Raiding.
---
It's Feralas, but yeah, I catch your drift.
---
South shore guards beg to differ
---
What do you use from 30 to 38 then?
---
They are games with actual real people, and they somehow dont matter to you? Like, you have no empathy towards them at all?
---
I was gonna ask, why do people want a slower weapon for things like sinister strike? Wouldn’t a rogue want fast weapons? Or they just want a hard hitting weapon and those are just typically slower weapons?
---
Agreed. But you should definitely have a shield ready to equip.
---
Now I'm regretting rolling a female night elf.
---
Haha I get that but a bunch of ally coming hot ganking. And now the one I was helping thinks I was with them and I get ganked and camped by him and his new homies lol.
---
this has nothing to do with the meta, it was just a dumb/bad/troll player. that would've happened in any meta
---
Someone posted a stamina bracer enchant in trade and I said i'd like one, he must have shift-clicked me and said "why? you're a mage you don't need stam." I just said okay and wondered why he talked himself out of a sale.
---
If your generating threat right you shouldn't have to worry about that rogue, mage, warlock or healer taking aggro. The only toon I've had trouble with is a Warrior in our guild who ran a ZF w/us. I didn't know she was prot and she was just a tad squirrely w/her WW. I'm spec'd into 31 Arms and 8 Fury currently and I have no problem. I alway do a Skull mark and I focus my threat on that mob if one of the others get away I grab it easily.
---
Would assume it is still the bans for the abuse of layer farming dungeon bosses. Blizzard said they would be rolling out bans as they investigated the accounts and assessed how much those accounts abused it. Makes sense there would be multiple waves as they discover/decide on more people who committed the offense.
---
Blaumeux gang rise up, 57 orc war mortalstrike here.

At least you can tell them to stop casting Blizzard, I get way more locks and priests dotting sheep 😭

wow dude congrats on killing green level'd enemies /s
---
Yep it does lol.
---
Wooooo woooooooo
---
Melee hunters are a thing too lol
---
You're so good!
---
Not owning a shield for when it is necessary is like being a rogue not skilling lockpicking/poisons. That's my chief complaint with warriors.
---
Thanks but is it a drop?
---
Knowing my luck it either won’t drop or I lose role and I don’t have much time to play 😓
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=10826
---
Not sure if blizz is smart enough to realize how bad they look sometimes x)
---
You're not missing much in Stonetalon, almost all the alliance quests there are nothing special and it fits awkwardly into level ranges if you were focused on Darkshore or Ashenvale prior. It also probably doesn't help that there are THREE Horde flight points all close to Stonetalon, as well as a dungeon that seems pretty popular for them. It also seems like a quest or something has Horde skirt real close to basically the only safe haven for the Alliance in Stonetalon, which would become decidedly less safe if high enough levels or amounts of players arrive.
---
Also too fast for paladins. SoC has a 7 ppm rate, so we ideally want weapons that are 3.5 or slower.
---
I like faster 2H's while leveling because they are generally cheaper on the AH. DPS is the only thing that matters before level 40 for Warriors. After 40 I'm probably not going to buy a 2h off the AH.
---
It's not about if it's possible, it's just about what makes the run go smoother. Taking less damage means healers have more mana. Also spell interrupts with shield further prevent damage.
---
God I love laughing at disabled people too AM I RIGHT GUYS???
---
That’s what he said
---
I didnt know this was a thing
---
The damage you deal is what you heal. There's no benefit from the +healing portion, it's only the +shadow damage part that increases the amount drained.
---
and then realize MC doesnt last long enough to make someone kill their pet.
---
I went through a whole ZF run and didn't win one green or blue roll.
---
I just sap hunters, kill the pet, eat then fight the hunter sans pet at full life and energy.
---
Slim but not impossible.
---
All the same green shit honestly
---
Me and a priest Mind-controlled a warrior and then healed + buffed him. We could've killed him, but we did that instead. :)
---
&gt; the sole reason for bringing a bear is leader of the pack, brez, innervate, and an offtank that can do decent dps
---
ftfy
---
what is the actual name for warzone? googling that turns up nothing for me.
---
And here I am guildless at 60 on a server with no guilds that are 60
---
Pretty sure this is an ISP problem connecting to blizzard services.  It's been reported in the wow tech support forum as well.  I'm having the same issue.
---
False
---
I play a priest and love warriors and regular dungeon runs, but tanks are just hard to find.  Groups with a tank LFM always have a healer already due to the huge number of priests this time around.
---
Yeah. Single core cpu performance has improved a good bit since then, but not enough to make 150+ person fights smooth. If classic was able to utilize 16+ threads like many cpus have today then it would be a different story.
---
WotF really isn’t that great. Heck, orc is way better.
---
My raid has a bear and a kitty. Melee group loves leader of the pack.
---
It only shows up if you don't have auto-renew set up.
---
Slow is still more damage on cleave.  I also find more consistent rage generation in slower weapons for some reason.
---
When you're dual wielding, your mh / oh have the same miss/hit chances.  You may be thinking 2h (or non-dw) hit cap, but that isn't quite right either.  
---
There is no situation where 8% is the hit cap.  If you have 305 weapon skill vs a boss you effectively have a 6% hit cap for yellow abilities or non dw attacks.  For DW with 305 weapon skill the hit cap is 25% for white hits I believe.
---
The idea is you go gnomish, make all of the items/trinkets you want, then start over and go goblin. you'll still be able to use all the gnomish items but goblin has more on use/consumable type items that you will need to continuously make so its better for having long term.
---
Bump
---
Yeah, if they measured from hip to ankle instead of bellybutton to toe it might be a bit better
---
As a Hunter, agility is the second-most important stat in the game. It grants you ranged attack power, making it equal to attack power as a stat. The only thing that's better is the damage range on your ranged weapon.
---
Your melee weapons are stat sticks, they exist to give you any agility, stamina, and/or attack power on them. Don't take weapons that have chance on hit effects, because they only trigger on melee attacks, and the small chance of it happening on the rare melee attack you use is negligible compared to literally any amount of attack power.
---
So, that out of the way, what you're looking for is anything that has those stats on it. I'd stay away from the Auction House from here on out, as it's literally never too early to start saving the money you'll need for your mount. Do dungeons as you get quests for them, and look for any quest rewards that have more agility than what you're wearing. Armor type doesn't even really matter, if you happen to see a random piece of cloth that has better agility than what you've got, it's worth it to take it because you can rely on your pet to take a lot of the damage you'd otherwise have to deal with.
---
For specific pieces you should be looking for, you'll be better served finding a guide someone's made somewhere. If you're fine having another Discord server added to your list, [the hunter Discord server](https://discord.gg/8TVHxRr) has a lot of useful information (including links to other class Discords, if you're interested), check under the Classic Resources section. If you don't like Discord, don't know how to use it, or just don't want another server, there are two leveling guides that had information on what ranged weapons to look for: [Kargoz's](https://forum.classicwow.live/topic/39/1-60-hunter-leveling-guide-by-kargoz/2) and [Krug's.](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/hunter-leveling-classic-wow) The bows are listed pretty far down in both guides, and Kargoz's looks to have a more complete list based on faction.
---
I was actually spamming Purge. You can see it being spammed if you can find the spell (Action bar to the right in the middle) after he does cone of cold.
---
I was that ally. Not in OP's pic but I was always willing to help no matter who it was. But I'm dead inside from the constant ganks and betrayals from the Horde. The same horde who I just helped kill Bangalash is now ganking me. The same fucking horde I saved from Stitches is now attacking me while I fish. I sent all my mages gold to my new warlock and now I'm gonna fuck over every Horde that I can.
---
well, looks like being up there isn't an exploit according to Blizzard.

Sad to say, but I'm not going to resubscribe even as autumn is my favourite time on WoW due to plethora of seasonal holidays. Not that I'd even play retail, but...
---
I'm leaving at level 31 because zones are overcrowded. Flizzard didn't make enough PvE realms and each 30+ zone is full of gentlemen camping mob/qitem spawn points; doing quests is frustrating. This is not an authentic vanilla experience.
---
I will wait until the curve passes. After initial adrenaline rush I think I can lay it off for a month or so.
---
I guess that is only a testament to how successful Classic is. I'll be back.
---
Short answer: Yes
---
Long answer:
---
The way the spell drain life and siphon life work is 50% of the coefficient is allocated to the damage and to the heal, as the spells effects are Deal damage for the first effect and Heal Self for the second one.
---
Obviously this changes when blizzard adds the spell effect "leech" in the next expansion or two in which the 1 effect does both healing self and dealing damage.
---
HOWEVER, the spell has shadow school flags, thusly, shadow spell damage in this case operates for this spell and is still split between the two effects as elaborated earlier(even though this spell has two effects, the spell itself is still considered shadow and is affected by anything that increases the warlocks shadow damage), So because the bonus is split it means you'll never heal for more damage than you deal.
---
Bonus healing does not affect the spells at all.
---
Hope that clears things up.
---
&gt; ideal 2v1

you left out the part where they are level 49 and 50

Hey I have a serious question. My server says medium (Kirtonos), but it feels extremely empty. Im running around in the ashenvale, wetlands, arathi Highlands, silverpine and I'm lucky if I find one person.

What's the deal? Is medium really that empty?
---
Gratz (and I hate u btw :D )
---
I bought it for 40g on Gehennas-EU. I guess people don't go Strat live as much on your server.

I mean bads are bad, but if you actually think warriors should only shield tank you need to go back to retail.

I've never had a pug run give loot prio for expensive recipes to people who have the profession.
---
Pretty sure rogues are the ones who do the kicking.
---
*looks at retail writing staff*
---
also no layering
---
it isn't. 
---
I love posting damage taken to a party after the dungeon. DPS often won't realize it's taken and not done and call BS that I (tank) topped the charts. It is part of how I also measure how the group was.
---
The second a war turns to go the other way, you know he's making distance for intercept. If you see him go into beserker stance that's usually too late.
---
Killing mobs quicker also means you take less damage and the healer has more mana.
---
I wish, I wish so hard, that we still had GMs in game.
---
Imagine how quickly this sort of behaviour would evaporate if a GM popped into town in a flash of light, stunned everyone, told the roof top gankers to stop being idiots, and ported them to the middle of the ocean.
---
Pedanticism: "**cue** the endless stream" Queue is what you wait in. Cue is a signal that something is starting.
---
Hey man the dwarf body is totally achievable
---
I've been playing since vanilla and i was running SM lib a week ago and all this other mage wanted to do was spell cleave. Then when i wasnt following suit he got so mad at me and said this isn't going fast enough I'm leaving. Then proceeded to whisper me and tell me that I'm not being the very best mage i could be and i will fail in all the dungeons... I told him alright that's fine with me lol. People are crazy nowadays. I'm in no rush to 60.

THE FUCKING BRD ARENA OGRE BELT DOESN'T EXIST
---
Mages have an ability to consume a reagent sold by reagent vendors in order to produce a portal other players can use to travel instantly between major cities. The reagent costs about 20s. As is customary in situation where a service is provided most people tip for the convenience as well as the reagent cost. 
---
Recently individuals of the mage class have begun advertising portal services in major hot spots, clogging chats with yells and funneling what is intended to be a passive source of income into their pockets at the expense of other mages. While I acknowledge that individuals have autonomy and can offer it as a service if they wish, it is our position in the Union of Mages that this is a detrimental step towards a slippery slope and it is our responsibility to make the people of Azeroth aware of the ethics involved in purchasing a portal from these sellers. 
---
Additionally we would like to state that individuals offering portals of only one type can, and often are, bots operating without player intervention.
---
How you can tell when someone wasnt old enough to play vanilla wow.
---
It's not an exploit, just go up on the roof and attack them
---
The good news is they are at least pretty good for pvp with all that stam so you can have multiple sets of gear and still benefit
---
I just don't understand the draw, besides satiating an elitist mindset. I MTd for a hardcore progression guild in wrath and never used guides or pre made builds. 
---
I'm sure some bozo is gonna come along to tell me that that's impossible or it was super easy to do so in that xpac, but all I know is that I could do what was fun for me without a number crunched build in the hardest content that part of the game had to offer. Its a fucking game, lets play it instead of being overly obsessed gatekeepers eh
---
How'd you get forced? They haven't stopped security updates for 7 yet.
---
What did you want, a pat on the back for being a mage and killing two guys that don't know how to pvp well?
---
&gt; when it is necessary 
---
when is this? never happened to me and i did dungeons 17-60
---
That really does seem to be the running theme.
---
If a Paladin is trying to Proc SOC, then slower is better, because it's on a PPM system and does more damage per proc on a slower weapon.  SOR doesn't really matter whether you're slow or fast.
---
Faster weapons may do less overkill, but their damage curve is also behind.  If you have a 3.0 and a 2.0 weapon, that hit for 150 and 100 respectively, and a mob has 125 health remaining, then you instantly kill the mob with the 3.0 weapon, or you take 2 more seconds to kill it with the 2.0 weapon.  The more you front-load your damage, the better.
---
As someone who knows all the lingo, this was still kinda fun to look at
---
Thanks! Guess I'll stick to grinding out some levels until I can farm there then, appreciate it a lot! :)
---
You play alliance. You don't have undead edgelords, just gnome weirdos.
---
Its a laptop. 12gigs of ram, 940 card, i7 processor. I don't think its my laptop and overwatch runs fine, no lagging or anything when playing so I don't think it's my wifi either
---
They are devout followers of RNGesus, he has blessed them with the good rolls. It's really down to random chance, good luck for them, bad luck for you, it sucks but it happens. I wish you better luck out there dude! Get something purple while killin a random mob in the world! :)
---
Logging in once a week to raid exactly as planned.
---
Do you want me to blow your mind?
---
Right click combat log, settings, new, check all the boxes with the word 'enemy', 'neutral' and 'unknown'.  Now just pay attention even remotely and you can tell when enemies are near you.
---
You'll be back. You know it.
---
Obviously they prayed to RNGesus while you were worshiping false gods.
---
That's a low lvl issue mostly. Druids are called meat shields for a reason. Stam and agi help that, but so does armor. Make sure your more impactful armor is up to date, avoid cloth. We cant block or parry, so we need the armor and health. Tbh, the 20s were pretty rough. 30s get better, dire bear gets much better
---
Are you talking about queue times?
---
Ehhh... I think Blizzard's support is just fairly good at fixing fuck ups. I had a similar experience years ago with no public-facing post or anything. Was back when D3 was coming out and they did that "Subscribe to WoW for a year and get D3 and Tyrael's Charger mount" promotion. 
---
I saw the announcement at BlizzCon, immediately tried to do it since I was gonna be playing WoW anyway so why the hell not, but it wouldn't let me, telling me my account was ineligible. I was confused so I contacted support to ask about it, and they tell me my account has an outstanding chargeback on it for $14.99 and because of this, it was ineligible to participate in the promotion even if I paid the balance right then (account had to be in good standing for at least 3 months prior to the start of the promotion or some such and the chargeback had been there for years apparently).
---
I was extremely disappointed since I didn't even know it was there, but I paid it anyway to get it off my account and be done with it. Hung up the phone and went on with my day. Later that afternoon, I got a phone call. Answered the phone, and it was a Blizzard CS agent (a different one than the one I spoke to before; this one was a woman, the first one was a man). She said the case looked funky to her so she decided to look into it further, and discovered the chargeback was made during an account breach from when I wasn't even playing the game, and I should never have been held accountable for it.
---
She apologized profusely and said she spoke with her supervisor who gave her the go ahead to flag my account as eligible for the promo, and to either offer me a full refund on the payment I'd made for the chargeback or apply it toward a month of game time for WoW.
---
Granted, the cynical part of me thought it was because they realized they were screwing themselves out of a locked-in year long WoW sub over a $14.99 charge back. But still, it was a nice surprise. lol
---
I got charged by a lvl 23 warrior while I was herbing in Hillsbrad. I'm a level 60 mage lol
---
Faerlina will die a horrible death as soon as the "bigger" streamers who aren't normal WoW streamers get bored w/it.
---
Sinister Strike does weapon damage + X.  It costs the same energy and same GCD no matter the weapon speed, but does more damage with a slower weapon.
---
The attack power coefficient on strikes is normalized, so that the attack power put into the strike is always the same regardless of speed, but the base weapon damage is not normalized.
---
Just a bit curious about boosting friends through dungeons and how efficient this can be. For example, if I (60 mage) were to boost my level 15 friend through RFC will he get mad xp? Or is there some sort of thing to reduce the sp somehow? Thanks
---
If you expect 4 random strangers to pass on a BOE (well, consumable, but same difference) epic for you, you roll with nicer people than I've ever seen. Or perhaps you always run with 4 friends, in which case, jealous.
---
Hmmm, notice I said only be able to change hair and not the whole face/skin color. Also, I didn’t ask for transmog. What’s up with feeling so personally attacked because a rando wants to be able to change their hair in a game.
---
If I say "yes" it will upset you. Which is a mildly attractive prospect. But if I say "no" it's almost like I'm defending the new direction SW is taking, when I'm one of the people that dropped SW after TLJ.
---
So yes, but also no. And Star Wars as a story telling franchise has become crap. Visuals are still good though. All parallels to retail WoW oddly enough.
---
I feel like I made a mistake rolling on Faerlina with a buddy. I am really burned out with the amount of ganking that I deal with while trying to quest. They are offering free server transfers but only to other PvP servers do you know if I can opt to pay for a transfer can I go from PvP to PvE? I did a bit of looking online today and it looks like outside of the free offering that Bliz is making [you cant even realm transfer?](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/244160)
---
I'm level 44 now and have no desire to start all over but the amount of time I am spending running back to my body is really sucking the fun out of playing for me. I know its my fault for being on a PvP server but man I would love to jump to PvE realm if I can.
---
As a Warlock I feel sad for healers who think they should keep me topped at all times. I sometimes even stop Life tapping alltogether when playing with such a healer. I will eat after every pull, i will bandage mid boss fights, i will use HS during boss fights, If you keep me topped I cant use any of those and your mana is gone.
---
It is but if you're careful about mobs, you'll have no trouble doing it at 35.
---
Blizzard fkd up royally with transfer by not making faction specific and a wider range of choices. They reduced population for sure... by bringing 30/70 or worse to servers xD
---
Yeah it's PvP. I was trying to find groups for either BFD or SFK because stocks is kinda lame. What dungeons are good around 27?
---
I just read the tooltip for sanc again and I cannot believe I have been misreading it this whole time. Wow.
---
The only real problem I constantly hear about is a singular mage trying to force AoE onto a group of warriors/rogues/shamans. If a bunch of mages decide to AoE together, it's because it works really well once everyone learns the route. Hell I was a total AoE noob just yesterday, but I grouped with some mages that knew what they were doing, took notes, and eventually taught other mages the strat.
---
Like, no I'm not going to "let AoE die" because some retards don't know the prereqs needed to do AoE. I'm just going to clearly advertise what I'm looking for and try to be patient with mages that don't know what to do yet. All the good mages are sticking together, and all the bad ones are out forcing AoE on any group they get into, so all the regular groups only see the ugly side of it. (And by good, I mean even if they're clueless, they can follow along and learn.)
---
Yay. Didnt see a flair earlier xD
---
How's it feeling at 60? I feel way out numbered lvling with very limited dungeon options
---
What the hell, save some god damn luck for the rest of the world. I've found a blue ring at level 30 and... that's it. Sold for a cool 6g.
---
Keep your panties on ladies, plenty of that 6g to go around.
---
I'm only level 27
---
And I attempted to click and drag to see the side profile of that sexy outfit. *Sigh* It's been a long day, and still stuck at work. Save me.
---
If UD was a separate faction you'd never group with anyone who'd touched a boob
---
On vacation for a week. Got OCD and had to make sure my char was in an inn 3x before I left.
---
I always search for relaxed group. Works most of the time.
---
Worse than mages are actually healers that I pug with... They claim to be bored and then do stupid stuff that kills us.
---
to be fair if you're playing balance you have no chance to get into groups and if you do they're not going to keep you around long.
---
I played with 1 balance druid in 9 days 8 hours /played. He did less dps overall than the tank, first and last.
---
Guy don't say that, I also have around 11 days played but I have a full time job.
---
I didn't think about how much time I've put into the game, I thought it was just something I did occasionally...
---
Meta
---
0/0/51 full prot
---
i think its a shame you can't expose these people on the forums anymore.  back in the wild west days of wow, you could at least inform your server via the forum that people were greedy morons.  it was just a bonus when they tried to validate they're greed with arbitrary vitriol
---
Yea I guess it's not the fastest zone, but I prefer enjoying a zone and being a little slower over everything looking the same or having to deal with a huge fucking lake in the middle of the map.
---
Lots of nostalgia as well. Come to think of it darkshore is probably the only 10-20 zone I actually enjoy. Silverpine is just dark and depressing af while the barrens is just westfall but worse. Talk about walking simulator
---
Spellcleave is fun.. if tank healer and mages are all 100% colluding with big pulls. Its a beautiful thing. What gets me, is when a tank or mage assumes the grp is all on the same page and does stupid shit to progress the dungeon faster, resulting in more wipes, more time and less gold farmed overall. 
---
Obviously, dont join Aoe groups or start one, if you dont know what youre doing, or are unwilling to learn (its actually easier than normal, just needs some restraint) Those are the worst groups, where 60% of group is in spellcleave mode, and the other two dont know what LOS is.. but then youll find the 60% have only assumed the other two are in spellcleave mode too (add that to the fact many people do it differently, mage pulls, warrior pulls, IB pulls etc), and wont explain where to stand etc. 
---
If you start an aoe cleave grp, the onus is on communication, please know there are many LOS points and methods to group mobs, and we all havent been watching the same streams you have. 
---
I just finished 4 straight days of Cath Aoe...
---
Only one bad experience warranting a /spit to my own faction, but i still didnt drop group and i took over tanking and pulls when the tank rqd.
---
Also find there is more chance of discord and better communication in cleave groups when compared to normal dungeon runs, what about you guys?
---
Ah. So glad as a Druid I usually link up with regular groups. Never even tried to get into an AOE group, I don’t care about it. 
---
I just run them as I did back in vanilla (except I’m a Druid this time as opposed to hunter and then rogue) with the regular setup, or I had a couple groups that literally had NO AOE dps because we couldn’t get one (thanks AOE farming lol) but it was fine. We moved a little slow, but has no issue completing it and we all had a great time.
---
I was questing in Winterspring, killing Furbolgs, when a fuckwit 60 hunter killed me while I was low hp. I went back and fucked him up, and as he's at 5% hp, a paladin comes up, stuns me, and finishes me off. I spawn again, /question the paladin, he apologizes. He must have realized that I wasn't the one causing trouble. The opposite faction can be cool.
---
And people wonder why nobody wants to tank.... oh yeah because they are treated like punching bags by more than just mobs.
---
You only need the vw to run in periodically and punch her to activate the cloud, then pull him out again.
---
I don't think spellcleaving is making people retarded. People have always been retarded lol instead of targeting spellcleave as the problem, you should really look at the individual players.
---
Seriously though.. don’t like spell cleave? Don’t join it. Problem solved. There’s nothing wrong with ppl running spell cleave. Play the game how you want and stop judging others for how they choose to play.
---
\+1
---
How does one kill a level 2 and get put on 4 of the "top guilds" KOS list? This was an hilarious attempt to make you think hes special. Can nearly guarantee hes not.
---
Big lack of mages
---
Yeah the majority of the population are 30+ you are probably on an empty layer!
---
Just stoked it’s a ret paladin in the meme and not an enhancement shaman.
---
*Angelic Chorus Hums*
---
Sky: up
---
Fire: hot
---
ah, my dungeon route skipped uld
---
Rage huh? \*skins worgen\*
---
I've seen more people claiming people say 'pally can't tank, no taunt' than I've seen people actually saying it. Infinitely more, actually, since *nobody fucking says it.*
---
I guess it's inevitable. All the mages who know what they are doing are in actual AoE groups with other mages. The ones forcing it upon non-mages are either clueless or couldn't hack it with a real AoE group.
---
Yep, I love it as well. It has a classic fantasy feel to it that I just can't get enough of. Also Kara might be my favorite raid.
---
Thats about it at 27. There are a ton of quests for stockades. Even though there is literally 0 good loot its still worth running once or twice for the experience
---
I don't care for your anecdotes. You made a general statement which is blatantly false.
---
I have no problem gen'ing rage sword and board.
---
I'm a mage and a I did a runs last night that somehow ended up with TWO tanks, and they couldnt hold threat. They were pulling packs of 3-6 So cc wasn't an option, and I was the only real cc there anyway, so I had no choice to aoe if we were to have the dmg output to live, but that risked getting wrecked. Pally wasn't even using consecration..... there there was their pull management, trying to los  pull packs of 5 at ghaz and avoid pats, instead of being patient and taking out the pats first.
---
Thank you, mate!
---
It does matter in dungeons. Blizzard just did a ban wave. A dude in my guild got a month suspension and the big br guild on my server must have had the sane because they didn’t even raid this week.
---
More than that, it's 1315 armor in dire bear with 5/5 Thick Hide.
---
Dire bear gives 360% *increased* armor, meaning you multiply by 4.6 to get the base armor from dire bear. Then multiply that by 1.1 to get the thick hide bonus.
---
Does the Horde have connecting flight paths in the Eastern Kingdoms? I'm level 39 and so far I've only got the STV ones and UC down to Arathi. I'd like to be able to fly from UC to STV, is that possible? And if so how would I go about it? Cheers
---
Just because you’re like this doesn’t mean other people are.
---
They are not, in fact. Thankfully, I’ve never run into anyone like you in-game. All my impromptu groups have formed and filled swiftly and its members left as they finished to make room for new folks, and my invites are pretty much always accepted. Unnecessary competition is just bucket crab thinking in practice.
---
You are supposed to spit on their dead body and then eat them.
---
Both ist true, why would you lol?
---
Thats the retail trashplayers. They will fuck off when scammongold fucks off
---
I think faster weapons will generate more rage per second, so if you're only using this 1 ability and counting damage to the second target, maybe slower is better. I think slower is better 90% of the time, but there is a case where DPS is more important than top end weapon damage for arms pre-40 and fury 2h. I will just have to agree to disagree because I don't feel like doing any research.
---
XP will be **heavily** reduced if a level 60 is in the party.
---
He can run you through RFC to complete quests, but don't expect to farm the dungeon for XP.
---
Ally mage here, I always try to save randoms, even horde. I was in tanaris by the pirates and saw a horde warrior running from 3 mobs at low hp. I saved him and almost immediately after 2 warriors and a druid tried to gank me. Thankfully mages are like a bar of soap and I escaped with my life but they chased me as 3v1 all the way out of the tunnel, pretty sad. Got it on video too, should post it. I also went back there with a few friends 20-30 minutes later and shamelessly camped 2/3 of them for a few deaths and managed to find the 3rd later on running out of ZF, revenge never felt so good.
---
I dont like to kill people questing but if you gank me or worse its fair game.
---
I'm super glad hunters aren't getting as much shit. I've been playing with my friend (priest) and his wife (hunter). Back in vanilla she would have gotten shit on for being a huntard because she is new to the game. But now, all that rage is going towards mages. Luckily for me, I think I've been pulling my weight and not getting raged on as a warrior... yet.
---
/r/thatHappened
---
It does. Per month, I think, unfortunately, but it still does decay.
---
World PvP, class almost doesn’t matter.  A lot of engagements will have strong level disparity and/or inopportune timing for the target.  
---
Think of a man named Jayne for this: “I’ll kill a man in a fair fight, or if I think he’ll start a fair fight...”
---
Prove me wrong.
---
It only gets worse when your ubrs “tank” also doesn’t have a shield and gets two shot every pull
---
The axe is better in pvp situations by far.  That’s why most people snag it as the reward.  Burst/unplanned damage is what is desired in pvp.  So the slower ace hits harder while providing effectively the same dps.
---
Also why the pendulum of doom is so sexy for a twink pvp build.  4.00 swing timer makes for bigger critical hits.
---
The last bit hit way to close...
---
Did you really spend a large amount of gold on the scales? They are like 2g a pop
---
You don't see the problem in mobs respawning indefinitely on a very short timer being farmed over and over again? What if these mobs gave loot. 
---
These mobs should only give experience on first kill, there is a massive difference between resetting a dungeon and killing the same mobs over and over again in the same dungeon.
---
Every Horde ever.
---
1) If you are facing an AOE pull, regrowth/rejuve yourself and pull while they are still ticking. That healing threat will be on you when you enter combat.
---
2) Stats: ARMOR &gt; stamina &gt; str/agility. Dodge % is really great too if you are able to fit it in.
---
3) There's a deep feral talent that gives you extra rage on critical hits. As well a resto talent that gives you 10 rage when you shift into bear.
---
I’m the gm of my guild. I was the 4th 60 in my guild. We played pservers though so we knew what we were doing.
---
Idiot copycats created the mindset
---
Im a new mage too and yeah, if i hadnt played wow in classic days i think i woulda quit by now
---
Its like wading through cancer to get to 60 
---
But we all gotta get there somehow
---
She just needs someone who isnt a dick, to show some patience and teach her the way the group wants her to perform (cos aoe is ezpz compared to normal).. but elitists will just drop and replace
---
😕
---
It's annoying, but it's part of the game. If one faction is tired of it, do something about it.
---
With that 700g  =)
---
Is this an immediate screenshot after the first?  I see “screenshot captured” just BARELY visible.  Didn’t realize it captured that!
---
Its a drop yes. Off the witch doctor.
---
Are you comparing disabled people to ret paladins? Seems a little harsh on the disabled.
---
Oh yea. I tend to laugh and make sure my guildies aren't dumb enough to support those idiots.
---
Not to mention its normally 2-3 people taking damage when the warrior is "2hand tanking" since they rarely keep agro on everything so healing 2-3 people is far more mana intensive than just having one target to heal.
---
You apparently don't play a hunter and have no idea how white damage works. All pets have the same innate DPS no matter what attack speed. That doesn’t mean they do the same dps though. Say your 1.0 attack speed pet attacks a mob and gets 10 hits in for 20dmg each hit totaling 200dmg before the mob is dead. Now your 2.0 attack speed pet gets 5 attacks in doing 40dmg each hit totaling 200dmg . Same dps but your 1.0 attack speed pet gets in 5 more attacks. That’s 5 more chances to crit than your 2.0 attack speed pet. Add in misses, dodges and parries and it’s much better to have a 1.0 attack speed pet than a 2.0.
---
Beast Mastery hunters also have this talent called Frenzy. Spend 5 points into Frenzy and your pet gets a 100% chance to increase their attack speed by 30% for 8 seconds if your pet crits. If your pet crits again while Frenzy is up, that 8s gets refreshed, etc.... The higher the attack speed, the more times your pet gets to attack and possibly crit. A 2.0 attack speed pet has less of a chance to go into Frenzy mode and stay in it for the duration of a fight.
---
Pets, unlike players, do not have abilities that are instant and bypass the attack speed of a weapon. This means that a faster attack speed pet is going to be way better than a slower one. So yes, a faster attack speed pet does matter in PvE.
---
Idk about that man. I never hear shit against tanks unless if they’re just a bad tank. As heals, most of the time I get tanks that run way out of range, aggro a shit load of mobs, die before I can reach them, then cuss me out and kick me like it was my fault. Healers kind of get the butt end of the stick most of the time.
---
Edit: this applies to DPS too. I’d be rich if I had a quarter for every time someone ran OOR, pulled aggro, died, then blamed it on me
---
Much better than that, they gave him a free month of sub time which is so much better!
---
Might as well add in a few resists in there for paladins.
---
Nothing more frustrating when a mob resists Hammer of Justice.
---
BRD is a wmwalk in the park without a shield. Scholo is starting to get hard.
---
It's always these dumb shit newcomers who watched a video by some theory craft streamer and think they're now professionals. Guys play the game like it's Diablo 2 cow level runs and call the experienced players idiots whenever they're called out. It's the funniest and saddest shit I've seen go down at the same time.
---
It's a by-product of the Twitch omgl33thaxorspeedrunzworldrecord culture, which has been a growing cancer since day one. 
---
It's probably best to just cast them out and find replacements as often as possible. Get to know the good tanks, give them the recognition they deserve once the run is over, and invite them along in the future if they're free. That always meant a lot to me during vanilla and on private servers.
---
Yeah, shield bash isn't even useful in dungeons /s
---
So gracious
---
Yes, feral offtank slots are limited but they exist.
---
Holy shit, you put Crusader on that?!
---
Incendius? Saw this last night
---
I think that only applies if you have the Fury talent that gives you rage per swing.  My experience with a 1.5 dagger that does 18 DPS and a 2.8 sword that does 15 DPS, is I usually had rage with the sword.
---
Here's the dirty little secret: AE spellcleave sucks for xp.
---
If you look at the players who get to 60 lightning fast, they aren't Mages. They're Druids, Hunters and other classes which are exceptionally good at outdoor questing. Why? Because the combination of chewing through mobs, no setup delays and frequent xp boosts from quest turn-ins are a lot better than what you get for running a dungeon more than it requires to complete the quests there.
---
However, there are certain classes - such as Mages - that combine being mediocre at outdoor questing with exceptional AE. For *them*, AE spellcleave works well because it optimizes their damage/mana ratio - and thus the limiting factor on how fast they can kill.
---
Unfortunately, this tends to mean that those Mages - and anyone who tagged along with them - hit 60 and have no idea how to deal with level 60 dungeons where you can't just mindlessly AE everything down (at least not with the gear you have when you hit phase 1 60).
---
As a warrior: he is correct apart from BRD needing a shield.
---
I have a whole guild named after me because i gkicked a player.
---
I reeeeaaaally wanna roll a warrior for that reason but I know if BC ever comes and Horde gets pally that'll be a dead character
---
Agree to disagree I guess, the amount of times you wait with a longer weapon adds up to be longer than the shorter one in the scenario you specified, so in most situations, front loading your damage only means waiting longer to kill a mob, and push spells back far less often. 
---
Some paladins dont go SoC, correct me if Im wrong but SoC has to proc whereas righteousness procs EVERY hit, no?
---
Then theres the thing with holy paladins that use some 2hs.
---
My experiance when leveling was Alliance Vs Horde Vs HoRdE.
---
Are you me?
---
:/ yeah I knocked them out. Guess I'll have to wait till gnomer.
---
the weed or the wow? lolol
---
Except the whole point of this thread is that the expectation of every group being spell cleave is bleeding into groups that don’t even have mages!
---
Or are you me?
---
So I built a new comp and did what you said. Downloaded my legit windows onto a flash drive and reinstalled it on the new computer. All is well and I tried to overclock my computer outside some parameters and it crashes. Well I had to restart my computer to an earlier date and now its saying I need to activate windows and using the flash drive with my windows 10 doesnt seem to do anything.
---
Kinda hooped on what to do for now so I've been playing with it.
---
I like to gank an Ally, then stealth and wait till they respawn. Then as soon as they start killing a mob, I pop out of stealth and help them kill the mob. Perfectly balanced.
---
Few things to keep in mind
---
1) it doesn't matter how much AP you have. If you miss you do 0 damage. This is why Hit general out weighs other stats point for point
---
2) the more hits you have, the more chances at WF procs (horde) or poison procs.
---
3) white hits proc the Sword spec proc which is just adding damage
---
I haven't theorycrafted vanilla to a large extent for rogues but this was the case in TBC with similar mechanics in regard to the hit table. (There were other factors in TBC that made the value of white hit cap even higher, however the theory for classic still stands).
---
You kill princess, rotgrip and gizlock, then vendor their items which gets you ~45g/hour (maybe 55 if you're fast, less if you arent)
---
I couldn’t find a tank after lvl 50 so I started gathering tank gear to get into groups. Now I tank more than I don’t, with 6600~ armor and 6k~ hp. I just switch to heal gear when we run MC as a Druid
---
That is a very good point.
---
theres a raid that can be done 120x a day. Also tons of other dungeons, gold farm, rep farm, etc.
---
I dunno the crap about the «rogue stay unnoticeble» in the mountain and hunter flare, come on :D 
---
He can literally hide in dozen of places where they wont check for stealth.
---
Wow an ad Hominem. You're literally wrong and players like you are the ones that overpull, wipe the group, and flame the tank and healer.
---
The fact you feel you need to argue that theres no difference between classic runs and heirloom runs is fucking sad.
---
You're arguing MeCHanICs mAkE ThE GAmE HaRd.
---
Retail fucking ignores mechanics dog. Heirlooms let your group run and gun dungeons in 10 minutes. Legion had difficult mechanics and you retail kiddies SHAT YOUR BRAINS OUT complaining about how ItS ToO HaRD BLZz
---
Take your edgelord ass back to retail.
---
Fairbanks
---
How do they message you? Can you have an alliance and horde chatacter on the same realm? Or was it through battle net or different account?
---
That's a nice endeavour for sure, best of luck for it friend.
---
Next time you pass I'll drop a totem for you to take with you :)
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
You mean people who spend every waking moment they can playing Classic WoW, and posting on WoW forums while they can't, aren't representative?
---
Could we not repost comics made by actual fucking nazis. There's a reason the subreddit was banned.
---
That's why if Brokentooth is level 37-39 it's a perfect target :) no chance the loyalty is high enough1
---
The concern that zones might not be populated enough isn't what I dislike about layering but I have heard it brought up a lot be people criticizing layering and I agree with you that the world feels very full and active despite the concerns about layering.
---
For me, it just kinda takes away something and I can't really put it down to one thing, I guess I just like the community aspect of Classic and layering fractures it a bit though nowhere near as much as the addition of x-realm phasing in Retail did. It's just little things that I realize aren't a big deal but still kinda breaks a bit of the illusion for me. Just stuff like yesterday getting a heads up that my friend's guild just killed Ony and they are heading to SW and lucky me! I'm in SW already so I stick around to get that nice buff only to miss out because I ended up being on the wrong layer which in hindsight I should have thought about but it didn't occur to me at the time. Or the reduced chance of running into the same people as you quest through the zones even enemy faction players that you have a rivalry with. Or when Leveling in STV this one time and it was raining heavily which I hadn't seen before and was really cool with the lower visibility and stuff, a friend logs on to join me and without thinking I just take his invite and poof clear skies, no more rain. It seems silly now that I think about it haha but I still never saw it rain there again before I moved on to another zone.
---
Still, I get it's a necessity at the moment and the issues I have with it probably pale in comparison to what it would be like if everyone was on one layer, probably would never get a single quest done but I am looking forward to them removing or at least reducing the layers later on.
---
thanks dude :)
---
Yep this is what I am doing with any best twink items I find. Have just sent them to a bank alt to forget about till phase 3. The prices for items like this will skyrocket once bg's come out.
---
&gt; Top DPS charts and you get priority on gear is usually how gear is decided when raiding
---
No it's not, lol.
---
I've got a years worth of tokens on my retail main... and there he sits
---
This is a tough question because a lot of it is based on speculation, it's generally a given that these items will raise in value and that it's better to hold it, but I imagine that there's at least a dozen other players with this same mentality just holding their Staff of Jordan waiting for the price to go up.
---
My suggestion would be to hold it until you actually need the gold, in the meantime you can track whether the price is increasing/decreasing. If you're level 40-59, you won't need a lot of gold, and by 60 you can sell the staff if you want to speed up the grind for your epic mount. 
---
If you're looking for a good price though, I'd say that if you can get 400g+ for it, then it's worth selling.
---
That is why you wait until you see a hunter with a levle 37 brokentooth :)
---
Nothing wrong with wanting to efficiently clear tedious low level dungeons
---
Can't ban it without affecting damage meters and log parser.
---
That's great and all, but can I get a hat wobble?
---
Soooo fuck you, ur dumb, screw off RP douche.
---
In the warriors defense druids hold agro more easily than warriors. Combined with derpy dps who each focus a different target, can make a big difference in how a run goes.
---
Then you remember you have chrome remote desktop on your phone so you log in and hearth.
---
I can’t comment on pally tanking...I know very little of paladin outside of some exposure many years ago.
---
You pallys seem nearly invincible with the bubbles. I vaguely remember the Redoubt talent but you have to be hit to trigger it?
---
Anyways I’m sure tanking can be done, especially when the talents and abilities exist to enable it. I remember the good ol’ Mount Hyjal pally tanks.
---
When I 2h tank I get 300-400 dps in packs at ST. That's a lot of rage, and aggro, and damage. I'm only throwing a shield on for bosses or if things get too hairy
---
Awesome tanks for the tips!
---
dont watch next time
---
Chain lightning the mob so you kill it first and then immediately kill the Ally with the bounce
---
Because I don't want people to be discouraged from getting into it because they read your comment.
---
Added later. Just see how much damage a frostbolt does and see how much a missile hits for.  If the missile hits for more than 1/2.5 of a frostbolt then use missiles for more dps.
---

---
You're looking for Kargath in the badlands.
---
best way to get there is to go to arathi and walk south into the wetlands and further south into loch modan through into the badlands.
---
Had it drop in a party the other day. Ele shami ninjed it and claimed it was better than his int and spelldmg staff.
---
We made him equip it.... And the mad men did it instead of just rolling it fair and square.
---
as a tnak myself, this is very true but with arcane explosions to be more precise
---
I know that, as a warlock it's a super efficient farm, hes saying hes a druid. The princess druid kill I watch took 6 mins, its 45g an hour if your in and out in like 11mins I think? Feel free to correct me. If its take more than 50% of your time killing princess its not 45g an hour. And earlier in the thread he said he was only killing princess, furthering the idea it's not efficient gold per hour.
---
I see you, SqueeshyRogue. May you find water and shade.
---
Viper Sting does next to nothing against Mages. That's more something you do against SPriest, Warlock, Pally, etc. Classes that you can actually kite.
---
Holy spec until consecration then you go down prot
---
Yep, plus the mines are bugged and blow up immediately right now. 
---
Found an awesome group and we got it done though. :)
---
Oh, I didn't realize bloodthirst went off attack power.  For some reason I was internalizing it as 45% weapon damage. That's really good to know. Very related follow up question, does the heal get stronger off of anything too?  The talent reads 10 hp per hit, which at the level you need to even cast the spell seems underwhelming.
---
I have details! installed, but I know it'll be a while before I really get a chance to try it.
---
Thanks for spending the time to respond, I appreciate it!
---
Ive had mages cast blizzard on bosses. Fighting only the boss. Only. Blizzard.
---
Step one would have been faction specific xfers to reduce pop. Other option is one way faction changes. Otherwise nothing
---
&gt;Im surprised you got as far as you did, Id hate to have to avoid zones like STV entirely while leveling simply because of the amount of pvp.
---
This is actually the best part.
---
A lot of streamers there are long time private server players (esfand, staysafetv, etc) so im sure itll be ok
---
Yeah CoC is def. harder and less mana efficient, more dps tho. I'd just go blizzard as a beginner and worry about CoC when more gear
---
Idk, it will never dip below 300 tho. It is one of the best twink caster staffs out there for the 39 bracket and people scoop them up
---
But this one costs money to cast
---
Well since you guys seem to not know the definition, I copy and pasted it from google.
---
 ig·no·rant/ˈiɡnərənt/*adjective*
---
1. lacking knowledge or awareness in general; uneducated or unsophisticated.
---
* lacking knowledge, information, or awareness about a particular thing.
---

---
&gt; Imagine admitting you watch streamers. 
---
This definitely falls under discourteous or rude, as he is in implying he is better because he does not admit he watches streamers whether they do or not) vs someone who does admit they watch streamers. (Not saying he falls under uneducated, but that may apply to him as well).
---
Some people said it could be as high as 500g but that sounds crazy. Is it really that good?
---
my guy I responded to a comment and I feel like you think I made a post....
---
Read the comment I responded to and the read my comment. This is all about how mages and other classes are so into or against aoeing that there is no patience for mages that are perceived to have done something wrong by some member of the group. You say if some people are telling her she’s doing it wrong she probably is...well ok you’re standing here defending the mage aoe meta while almost everyone else is saying it sucks.  r/selfawarewolves
---
I'll have you know, I've never sat in qweway.  And my AH is not fucking 1%ed
---
Paying for a convenience when they have tuned the game to require that payment to get what we would consider a normal game play experience is pay to win.
---
See that's interesting, cos this is what puts me off WoW
---
I understand that you are looking to get specific information but, that's just not possible. Inflation affects all items differently over time. Each and every server is also different. The best answer I can give you is - when you find someone who will buy it at an amount that you feel comfortable selling because your personal need for gold. For example you are only 200g away from that epic mount. You look to sell it on the ah, and that one guy selling his still hasnt sold it. Maybe you list for 200... maybe more to recoupe the ah deposit cost. Maybe you spam trade chat... point is I'd sell it when my need for gold is at its greatest, that way you can turn the gold into something tangible so regardless of what inflation does, you're still happy.
---
Sounds like a problem with the individual not the game. That warrior is either trolling or clinically retarded asking for mage aoe when there’s no mages. I don’t see how the spell cleave meta made that guy retarded all of the sudden.
---
Alright! Thank you for the input!
---
Your enjoyment was diminished because other people somewhere in the world did something before you?
---
That really a terrible way to go through life. You'll never like anything.
---
Old Blanchy here
---
If you put something on your W key it does.
---
Perfect. I guess it just says need engineering at x level and not requiring gnomish to use. Thanks for explaining.
---
44 is halfway when looking at strictly xp. But because you gain way more xp/hour in the later levels, I think high 30s might be halfway.
---
Burning trash can keep you warm. BFA is just sad.
---
All pvp servers are horde dominated. There's no excess alliance players to pull from. That won't work sadly.
---
That’s unfortunately correct. You would have to roll new characters on a PVE realm in order to make the change. At least for now, not sure what the future will bring though.
---
Ganking usually. I never killed greys in wPvP but when I crossed hunters I'd sap them, kill the pet, then leave. I didn't know the pet could leave them, I just wanted them to think "uhh, wtf was that minor inconvenience?".
---
Where they're pointing to each other because they're the same?
---
Having to actively play the game is less fun?
---
to each their own, but unless you have a huge pool of expendable gold i think this is a bad investment. A couple of my 'hardcore' friends dropped 500g on truefaith while their maces are still unenchanted, havent leveled engineering, haven't bought eye of shadow yet, when they could have just gotten robes of exalted for 5 less healing, for free.  
---
heres an situation i give to my friends. lets say you have a green of healing belt with +39 healing. You see a +44 healing belt on the AH for 500g (lets ignore the fact that they actually go for about 30-50g). Do you buy it? Obviously not. Yet people are totally fine with dropping 500g for truthfaith? Seems a bit.. odd
---
I didn't watch in the first place.
---
This isn't a shitpost sub.
---
Free month of game time? Shieeet
---
Ty for the advice! I will do this for sure
---
Massive thanks! Cheers guys :)
---
nice spit macro though
---
When I'm farming, yes.  I like doing it when I'm watching a movie or something.  Can't say my fav part of world of Warcraft is iterative farming
---
You're using spells to cleave enemies. You're complaining about slang lol. It doesn't inherently mean what you think it should mean.
---
Isn't this the one that just rides down the river? So it easily crosses the zones because you're literally on the zone boundaries.
---
Hey, that's interesting. I definitely support everything you say about story and lore elements, but I'd like to specify one thing. Is skill ceiling in Classic really that low? I mean, back in the day players had talent trees, various types of resistance and stuff. Or maybe it all doesn't matter, since it's some sort of preparation for actual in-game activities?
---
I'm on your server.
---
Love it
---
I feel your pain. I was healing SM Armory runs with an Orc Warrior using Whirlwind axe, blood fury on cd and not using sunder armor. He was nice person and all, but holy shit I don't ever want to play with him again.
---
Mind sharing your action bar related add ons?
---
Thats like 2 levels too early to spec in to shadow.
---
Shadow isnt good until 42-45.
---
Correct
---
Friendly reminder to make a macro for your kill emotes. So many good revenge ganks on here, but everyone excitedly messes up their /emote at the best time. Shamed enemies only stay on corpse for 1 sec, you need a hotkey'd button to rub it in.
---
This was my first time playing any wow and I just resubbed for 3 months. I’m officially hooked! But I can see how it’s not for everyone.
---
Uhm, wrong. Fake news.
---
On launch day you would chain die for hours until you ragequit as soon as you ressurected because of how player dense it was. You either avoid it or never get anything done.
---
All for what, honor? to spend on?
---
.......
---
jackshit.
---
Even if you’re a good tank, insta-kicking people without warning or conversation will earn you a rep as an asshole. Eventually this will bite you in the ass as it narrows the number of people willing to deal with your crap.
---
Mage PvP is such a joke lol
---
Yeah, it's the best staff for that level of twinks in battlegrounds. Plus, it's still pretty good at 60. 
---
But that's a fair while away, and you have to remember that 400G now may be worth more to you than 500g+ in 6-12 months.
---
You could potentially use that 400G to buy 2-3 more twink items that sell for much more, or buy an epic mount that lets you get to areas faster and find ore/herb/spawn locations faster. 
---
Ultimately a lot of it comes down to speculation, but I'd say anything in the 400-500g range is damn good value for a random drop.
---
Jokes on you he was only pretending to be bad!
---
Groups that are not spell cleave groups are suffering from the tactics/opinions/strategies employed by spell cleave groups - so its not like tou can just ‘not join those kinda of groups’. I had a warrior jn my group last night asking the mage why he wasnt blizzarding and wanted to keep sheeping - our group makeup was a mage and two rogues and a priest and a warrior...lolol
---
You also used to be able to do this in goblin towns so the guards would kill the pet, but not you. I'm many levels away from seeing if it still works in Classic though.
---
I feel this in my bones
---
Druid tanks who innervate the healer. *NUT*
---
There are still GM's in game. Unfortunately they cannot be everywhere, and typically if someone is reported for terrain exploitation they are given a warning to knock it off or temp ban is issued.
---
Your best bet, report them and let the GM's take care of it, if you cannot safely get on the rooftop and gank them yourself.
---
I am sick and fucking tired of the 2hand tank “meta”. It is annoying, it doesn’t make the run go any faster, it is more stressful on the healer and the dps, no mitigation occurs in the form of cc....get this fucking retail spam go go go shit the fuck out of classic you god damn kids.
---
Edit: and take fucking words like “meta” with you also
---
Retail made people soft
---
keanureeveseoah.gif
---
A few weeks ago, while leveling in the Barrens, I showed up to do this quest. There were two other people there, killing lions.
---
So I blow the horn, and Echeyakee shows up and proceed to kill it and leave. One of the players the  messages me angrily, saying I stole the mob. I then explained that you have to use the horn to summon it. Fortunately they apologized, and then did so themselves.
---
Yea, but a giant ban wave went out today trying to tag people who used power leveling services. Their algorithm might have been left too vague in order to account for VPNs.
---
Bruh... I've ran into 45+ shamans who dont drop totems.  Not for trash, not for bosses, not for anyone.  So I somewhat believe that people are this daft at 40+
---
Watching 2h warriors tank makes me want to roll one as an alt. It looks so killer, and you really only need the shield for "just in case" moments
---
The feeling just before your dreams are crushed by reality. Here is some bread bitch.
---
And yet, so few are capable of even that.
---
yes, its super fun to chain die and have your progression halted for literally no reason and have nothing to gain for it.
---
In earlier raids, mages use imp frostbolt (2.5 casting time) and in later raids use scorch (1.5 casting time) i dont think mages are just gonna stand in the fire
---
That's not the case, I've been trying to play the game just like I did in vanilla(maybe with slightly less keyboard turning and clicking on abilities). Layering in general, and particularly the abuse of it, isn't something I think fits into the spirit of classic.
---
sure, but blizzard facilitated this by not doing anything for a month and then fucking everyone else. My issue is with blizzard
---
Every three hours.
---
Skeram unite! 
---
Alliance scum....
---
9/10 it's a gnome mage tho
---
Let's be real, druid damage specs and warrior damage specs aren't even in the same conversation.
---
It's about looking good on trolls while beeing borderline viable. if anybody missed the point. 
---
It looks awesome keep going!
---
That's basically what I do. I grind a lot of beasts. I usually make about 20-30g a level since level 35. I just spend it. And I'm not worried about my mount. Travel form is only 20% slower.
---
&gt; Though if they ever make classic+ and Apes lose the world first of new content to some guild that saved their lights for 4 years, then they might regret it.
---
They don't care, they rolled on an EU server which means they'll always be 2h late compared to US when it comes to patch release.
---
Thanks, I'll see if I can add more information to my appeal.
---
The rare redpill in the thread
---
I try my hardest!
---
Glad they made it right
---
Discussion
---
I think theres a difference with "you are aoeing wrong" and "yo we have 3 targets, use an aoe spell instead of using frostbolt."
---
So the dude asking the mage why he wasn't using X spell isn't telling him he is doing it wrong, hes asking why they're not using spells in the correct scenario. 
---
This has nothing to do with the "AOE Meta", its about using logic when there are more than 1 targets present.
---
You just said above that the two warriors were looking for a tank. So they are very clearly dps. So what are you even talking about “don’t run dungeons as a tank”? They aren’t running it as a tank. Every warrior you see isn’t a tank. Sorry to disappoint you.
---
Main reason why it’s one of my favorite areas. So nostalgic during fall/winter.
---
I see my mistake, thank you!
---
Can you explain why Agility is a higher priority than strength for shamans?
---
APES are trying to get into the Molten Core raid, where they will be alone just the 40 players in the raid fighting against monsters. 
---
But guilds from the other faction want to block them, or at least kill before they can get in.
---
Yea, I guess so. I'd be farming gold like crazy just to out bid everyone in case it comes to that.
---
Even if its just princess the gp/h isnt too terrible
---
[Sweet Jesus, Chromie!](https://i.imgur.com/WubvMvl.png)
---
Sup dude, race you to 60?
---
Druids are fantastic dungeon tanks because of Growl, among other things. The problem for raids is they lack a few things that make warriors better. Really, that's the case with both Druids and Paladins.
---
Only when publicly called out it seems... why do we never see a post “i got wronged by GM, I submitted report and got apology and GM fixed my issue!” Type of posts? This is fandom, those posts would get upvoted way up. 
---
Cynical comment. I know. But I have little faith in Blizz doing much with their automation and cost savings. Likely not much to do with actual GMs who might feel under pressure and rush through tickets to meet their quota ... but we’ll never truly know.
---
Especially since it’s manager writing and it “came to his attention “. This wasn’t from OPs report but the post that blew up.
---
Yeah played on plenty of private servers as alliance and now rolled horde on classic and kind of feels like playing a new game. The variations between the 2 races makes your playstyle change and I love that.
---
I farmed my epic mount, more or less most my pre bis and currently leveling a warrior at 41. Having a blast
---
someone posted a screenshot of the head CM in 2005 saying it was not allowed.
---
&gt; I wish they hadn't completely shit the bed with that game.
---
preach it.
---
&gt; They're all very good, but world first on a brand new boss is a different beast than getting the first kill on Ragnaros for the upteenth time.
---
It's even as if they have cleared multiple time vanilla content and proved it.
---
I don't know why it took me over 15 years to put that together but here we are.
---
Leveling a 60, post-dungeon-raid era and taking me not that much longer over straight dungeon grind to hit 60.
---
And to be honest, leveling in open world (while taking me slightly longer, and dealing with issues in bottlenecked quests and massive faction imbalance) so much more fun.
---
You’ll probably get it. I’m gonna be busy with the new magic set prerelease this weekend so I don’t know how much time I’ll get it. Prob get 60 around Monday/Tuesday.
---
That's what the coffee is for.
---
The answer is ambiguous.
---
I'm saying you probably got caught up in a layering banwave, I'm not saying you're guilty or not.
---
Layering abuse, and pvp guard deadzone abuse in towns are the two major activities blizzard has made posts about impending bans.
---
yes there are a lot of 60s still playing daily, that isn't the majority of the playerbase though &amp; is probably their reasoning for not releasing BGs in phase 1. catering to the hardcore playerbase has never been good for the longevity of a game
---
End game minmaxing
---
Haha yep I got booted in the middle of playing yesterday when this happened to me.
---
You are thinking about the statistical problem the wrong way.  If the rolls are truly random between 1 and 100 any given person has the same probability of winning any given roll.  From that point of view, yeah it looks weird that he won those rolls.
---
But then think about the fact that there are literally millions of people rolling on millions of items and it will make a little more sense.  Out of millions and millions of roles, a streak of 10 winning rolls is essentially meaningless.
---
I fucking hate this place
---
Probably would have gone for a lot more in phase 3 when people are making level 39 twinks.
---
But that's a long ways away. I probably woulda sold it now for mount money too.
---
&gt;yes, its super fun to chain die and have your progression halted for literally no reason and have nothing to gain for it.
---
There's more to WoW than just getting to level 60 and getting new items.
---
I'd gladly have my level/gear progression halted for this sort of action anytime. 
---
Plus if you're learning from these experiences, you're gaining something from it.
---
Hey I love all of you folks at Classic wow live like my brothers. I’ve been through the p server days with y’all and have been in the various discords. 
---
However you’re kidding yourselves in this interactive onyxia attunement guide. There is already the one true interactive onyxia attunement guide and it is made by crendor: https://youtu.be/vyQ-7o397Uk
---
are you on right now? Im down to do this server xfer style
---
:( *cries in 100k xp/hr aoe clears*
---
Glad it worked out in the end!
---
That's the issue. Many of the spellcleaving sweaty nerds are from retail. That's the wow they know. It doesn't help that all of the streamers did it too.
---
I ain't no bitch. Fix the game.
---
There’s nothing to nerf
---
You don't stay in a guild like apes if you can't listen. Also have to be a master of your class.
---
I've had underleveled warriors try to 2H tank in BRD.
---
They gonna get real mad when they realize my mage has 0 skill points in ice. The name is Flamenwerfer, why would you think i would actually use ice spells?
---
&gt; Definitely waiting 6+ months to roll on a pvp server.
---
I am on 2 different pvp issues, one of which is alliance 2:1 H:A ratio.
---
Best time ever.
---
&gt; How do you guys feel about people doing brd runs for a months time for 100k xp/hour cruising their way to 60 and then when it's our turn blizzard comes it and removes it, same with SM 10 man groups
---
I feel like these players have punished themselves harder than Blizzard ever could.
---
As someone who uses this racial alot, yes, do not heal me. When i pop bloodfury on a dungeon its with the expectation i wont get healed. I actually avoid using bloodfury when we pull large, and use it during safe controlled pulls.
---
Instead of slag hide gloves I am using shadowcraft helm plus gloves. You lose slightly on mitigation but have a lot more threat stats.
---
Just dont do it?
---
Just to annoy them? Like, they can still go in right?
---
People do various things to relax/be entertained, etc.
---
If you're actively doing things for selfish reasons that hinders other people's enjoyment, you know youre ruining their fun, and you continue to do it....then you're an asshole.
---
Warrior takes a lot of dedication. The dumb warriors fall off in the 40s when leveling gets challenging. Show love to the warriors who made it to 60.
---
Chen is only as canon as Hydralisks in WC3. He's an easter egg.
---
Can you show us your tattoo?
---
That’s my point
---
Windfury
---
Yeah, as soon as I position the mobs where I want them to be the first thing I do is get my eyes up to make sure my healer is clean. I keep moving the camera around during the fight to keep my eyes out for adds or patrols as well. The goal is to be able to pick up any adds before they can get to the healer or anybody else in the group. The sooner I notice potential issues forming back there the better off we are. Not having to look for a specific character in a crowd makes this much easier. Just quick glance, check to see the gold star is clean, eyes back on the targets. The less I have to think during that process, the more automatic it is.
---
By 1.12 classes were buffed and dungeons were so severely nerfed that they were a joke.
---
Step 1: play 10x as much as you are now
---
Step 2: ???
---
Step 3: profit!
---
lol calling people that hit 60 in the first month of the game "hardcore players" nice
---
Saying that releasing BGs early would be catering to "hardcore players" lol nice
---
&gt; If you're focusing on PVP then yeah, go fire
---
I disagree, the amount of cc and defensives frost mages get makes them one of the best pvp classes
---
So are you soliciting opinions, or are you just looking for a group of yes-men to validate you and your opinion?
---
That's what i'm waiting for to actually get really into the game. If they just follow the same expansion timeline i don't want to waste my time.
---
I hope they announce some sort of decision or plans of the future.
---
99% sure he's talking about ZF grave aoe farming for XP.
---
Gotta get mounted to get mount that you’ll mount
---
My main is a warlock (53). My alt is a shaman. I rolled the shaman to encourage a friend (warrior) to level. I am pretty dead set on pvping on warlock in phase 2 and beyond. But I may make my shaman my PvE char if the guild needs it (we are DPS heavy, and even tank heavy, but light on shaman healers). 
---
But we are not a hardcore raiding guild. While we intend to raid and have 50-60 online players during prime hours, we won’t be raid ready for another month outside of a potential two guild raid group that we may do as a temporary move for those at or near 60 now. 
---
My server in general is short on tanks more so than healers. But my guild has plenty of tanks.
---
And cue is such an overused word on reddit. Cue this, cue that.
---
Yeah I just make my own groups and specify it's a full run, not some aoe spam xp farm run. 
---
Sometimes I feel like people on here lack basic communication skills and instead of just talking to people in game, they come on here in a tizzy
---
I understand this. After questing in the barrens the quill boar start lookimg thick.
---
I don't agree. Yeah warriors and mages are god mode but I think hybrids are well below the average, not just not top tier. Give them some unique utility however and suddenly it's okay that they are below average, they make up for it.
---
The gold income from doing graves is 40-50 an hour, how is there nothing to nerf when there's literally no market or competition to it?
---
Interesting, I did not know this - I always presumed taunt was an offensive action.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if that changed though, they have changed SO many of the little quirks from vanilla, for example defensive stance swapping no longer converts lethal falls to 90% damage ones.
---
Takes more damage, has roughly same threat output as warrior, but no mitigation cooldowns.
---
Yep.
---
He didn't say make it yourself over 40 days, he said "buy the cooldown" aka look in trade for people with available cool downs and provide them with the mats+tip to make the cloth for you. A lot of times that is cheaper than just buying the cloth outright.
---
Yeah that’s normal? You have to reset the entire instance if you want to kill them again
---
it has nothing to do with rushing, and everything to do with pushing the group to the limit of what its capable. find far greater excitement when the life is on the line with these giant pulls, and one wrong move can spell doom for the entire party
---
have leveled exclusively via dungeons (44 druid) and couldnt be having a more fun time tanking.. granted not every group is capable of taking on 10+ mobs a pull, I cater towards the build of the group.. some of my fastest runs were with a lack of true aoe, they just decimated the pulls of 2-4 almost instantly, chaining them almost non-stop
---
how is that not hardcore to reach 60 in the first month? do you have an actual argument or going to continue to spout ad-hominems?
---
I play on Deviant Delight and the community is just so friggin nice
---
Yes, the quest is there. But you have to talk to Awbee first and exhaust his dialogue options before the quest marker appears above his head.
---
In a similar vein, there's an NPC on moonglade that will start a Dire Maul quest chain if you talk to him and click through the dialogue options as well. The classic devs must've missed that one when scrubbing out quests meant for later phases.
---
I love how Arugal seems powerful but you learn during questing in Silverpine that he was a shit mage who used powerful artifacts to fuel his spells.
---
Gotcha. Well in that case, exploit early, exploit often. Get that epic mount before the potential nerf
---
They also appear through walls. I ended up healing last night and I threw the orange condom of protection on our tank and it sure did help. He would disappear around a corner to pull something, but I could see his location through the wall because of the icon over his head. I'll probably start making myself from now on while I tank because it sure was helpful to see the tanks location last night.
---
We can only hope. But I don't really believe in them remaking the success of hybrids of TBC, so I'll just pray we get TBC+ instead.
---
I'll never understand the fear people have of making their own groups. It's not difficult, just communicate what you want while questing or whatever.
---
I think you need a Shoot ability, I also dont think anyone but hunters can auto shoot
---
I used a 60 day game card :).
---
Are you implying that somebody would just make something up on the internet? That's preposterous.
---
Hell yeah! That wolf grubbed down. Brutal
---
That's a great feeling. But you know what's even better? 
---
When you turn in all those quests and see your exp bar go up a lot.
---
Oh shit ok, From my rogue trainer or another weapon master?
---
Ya. I actually started dual boxing with two accounts instead.
---
What makes the pet run away? Do they have to lose all loyalty first? I always thought they could run away after spending a bit of time at 75% happiness. Is that not the case?
---
I was the jerk engineer that sold single saronite arrows for the same price as full stacks.
---
To be honest I wish it ended at the epic mount : /
---
The reality of vanilla pvp is that a lot of the “skill” of it comes from using obscure items confidently as if they aren’t obscure at all.
---
Thanks dude xD
---
I used to be reaaalllly into endgame content and got fed up with all the lag and issues Elsweyr had brought. My main trial guild ended up dissipating and straight up disbanding because too many people were pissed off with whiplash changes and horrible performance, like certain attacks failing to indicate properly and wiping the group because of shit like dragon aerial breath attacks not showing properly. After skillbreaker we tried to get our shit together and continue working on other trials, we adapted, and we get smacked with dragonhold changes and nearly everyone just outright quit.
---
Only stuff we really cleared was vMoL and vCR+1 and stuff below that but we had a helluva time while it lasted
---
You are giving the public too much credit. He was the first tank I’ve healed that was that confused about how mages play but in his defense he said that all mages he parties with do the same exact thing whether there are on or three of them. So yes he was dumb but you know what? Every mage he was in a group with up to that point was also being dumb if they were aoeing inappropriately right? Why do those dumb mages think all they are supposed to do is blizzard? bc they are new and confused by spell-cleave and are unknowingly spreading the cancer.
---
If you normally group inly with friends or good players you have no idea how bad it is out there for people without those networks. The blind leading the blind to a place they think they should be going to but they really dont belong heh
---
A true SMOrc never stops
---
Retail is on its last leg because many of the game mechanics dilute the significance of other game mechanics. Let me list a few mechanics that are lethal to other features of the game:
---
1. Titanforging 
---
2. Cross-server play, sharing, etc
---
3. Catch-up mechanics taken too far
---
4. Profession squish, insignificance of crafting
---
5. Lack of individuality between classes
---
6. Lack of customization options for your character
---
7. Alt-friendliness disables you from taking pride in your character
---
All this being said, retail’s competitive endgame is mechanically challenging in a way that is totally different from Classic and some players really like the cooperation it takes to take down those mythic raid bosses or form a badassed arena team. But more recent design decisions have eliminated a lot of the RPG elements of the game, and also the MMO elements. You’re left with just a G. I think retail is far from dead, but it needs some tender love and care, and more close attention needs to be paid to players’ concerns and complaints. Is Blizzard too greedy and proud to admit that? Time will tell.
---
I'll have to look it up. Is it anywhere near 40g / hour?
---
Technically that can be brought by resto druids, just gotta remember to recast it every 40 seconds.
---
Easier for a feral to do it though, yeah, especially bears since they use it in their rotation, macro'd to Maul. (it actually does cause threat)
---
exactly
---
Hmm did a new icon for shoot appear in you spellbook?
---
We transferred to Earthfury from Herod last week. On Herod, I almost never engaged in PvP. Horde dominated. Attacking alliance felt just downright mean. So I never engaged in PvP. 
---
On Earthfury, initially I avoided PvP despite my vanilla kill on sight pvp stance. But alliance are about the same numbers as horde. I have been attacked out of the blue when minding my own business. So now I do fight back. It feels more like vanilla where we killed the other faction. I am less bloodthirsty than before, so I don’t always pvp. But having the option to pvp without feeling like a jerk is great.
---
Instead of taking “fair enough” as a way to not shit on someone else’s experience you decided to take it literally. I don’t agree with what they said but who am I to tell them they don’t see a lot of alliance in zones and they camp their corpse? I’ve seen it happen, not often but I’ve seen it.
---
It’s not though, besides being against ToS - 21 days to 60 is not efficient. And I don’t know anyone who would pay $800 to get it “sped up” to 7-14 days when you could just do it in same amount of time. The only thing efficient about it is the dollar cost to hours played... but if you have the time off it’s inconceivable to have someone else play for you.
---
The problem is the exclusivity of it. It's not really great to have a game mechanic that massively benefits only a very select portion of the game population while everyone else is left in the cold.
---
No offense, but you're apparently the class the benefits from it the most. Have you seen it through the eyes of classes that are unable to AoE farm?
---
Just feels wrong.
---
Ninjing and item is making another real life person waste a lot of time. Yes I know, it's not a life or death matter, but do you actually think that's a cool thing to do to others?
---
Pretty much any class would lose 3v1.  Gratz on being able to gang bang.
---
Cloth elemental gear is not BiS \*for pvp\*. You get more dmg at the cost of physical dmg reduction, which is one of their best defensive stats. Id say go for it. Im leveled enhance, rerolled resto at 60 and have been taking every piece of elemental piece i come across, regardless of armor class. As we know, pvp and pve BiS sets can differ greatly.
---
The problem is if you are a mage and join a group that doesn't specify if they are spellcleave or not and another mage joins as well, *someone* is going to pressure the mages to AOE.
---

---
No nothing of that sort, Just the thrown Icon that u get for throwing knives and stuff but no shooting option.
---
Open you skills tab
---
Under General
---
It should be there as "Shoot"
---
Not now,my night elf is mining lol
---
I bet the unpredictability is what keeps you in.
---
Eh relatively, paid 5g+ a pop. Spent all my money on consumables for MC, so it was all I had left xD.
---
*demonic voice*: **’INTEREST YE IN A PINT?’**
---
How the? Were you running group loot? Honestly don't see a world where this happens. You're not even tanking. Gratz though!
---
literally unplayable
---
&gt; The people in their group are not teammates, they are NPC's there to facilitate the impatient player's desire
---
This. This right here. Applies to real life people aswell.
---
&gt;  I'm gonna take a step back again when I hit 60 and not roll a second char because dayum this game is like crack.
---
Mhmmmmmmmm, SURE YOU ARE...
---
As they should, as a tank I will often be telling my mages whether or not they can use more aoe. Had a group where a guy just frostbolted skull like it was 2004 when I could have easily held aggro if he was aoeing
---
It's nothing about mana efficiency. Frostbolt spam will kill 2 non elite mobs faster than blizzard will.
---
Frostbolt DPS is better than blizzard DPS until you are AOEing 4 mobs minimum.
---
And they pull agro, die and blame the tank
---
They don't ban you but killing faction NPC's does have an effect on your pvp rank when honor comes to the game.
---
Research shows that 8+ hours of sleep a night is optimal for muscle growth... I think I’ll listen to that rather than your odd little anecdote
---
Got a bluepost for that? Would like to link to my guildies.
---
Frost Nova, Flamestrike, Cone of Cold, Arcane Spam ftw.
---
Imagine buying a power level in a game where a lot of the content is leveling
---
I’ve run into a lot of alliance characters with horde kill lists. No matter what you’re doing, if they see someone on the list they’ll kill them. If you’re not on there, you’re good.
---
Alliance is fun
---
You did great, enjoy it!
---
This looks good on you Blizzard!  Keep up the great work!
---
So yes let’s all complain about the trend and get the game changed so we can have a new trend to complain about. Spell cleave is here to stay so y’all are gonna have to learn to deal with it like most of the community already has. Don’t join spell cleave groups if that’s not what you’re looking for. You can’t change how other people choose to play so why is everyone bitching so hard? Once people figure out that spell cleave isn’t that good unless you do it really well they will stop. Metas change over time it’s going to be ok.
---
Im using auctioneer and a typical scan takes 30 minutes.  Is there a way to speed this up?  Is there an option besides TSM?  I seem to remember scans taking a long time in original vanilla, is it just how the auction house is?
---
Thanks in advance for any advice!
---
You can just craft Runecloth Belt and Cindercloth Cloak(?) to 300. I couldn't get hold off the bag or gloves recipe either and I didn't want to pay +60g for them since my only intention with tailoring was crafting the robe. I dropped tailoring as soon as I was done with the robe.
---
That’s the whole point though. It’s like saying “imagine the Roman army without the engineering corps building roads and bridges”.
---
I don't think I need improved slam if I intend to spam them one after another, right?  Unless I'm working on wrong information, the default slam cast time and GCD already line up perfectly (assuming I don't get pushback).
---
Unfiltered tap water, but I would tell you its Gucci.
---
Ey stay salty I guess
---
In WoW alpha they used to have shields too.
---
Thank you! I'll check that once I get home from work lol. I appreciate it alot.
---
Totally a good faith argument I am sure.
---
And you’ve just proved my point.
---
I just want things to be clear - I am a 60 mage, I have an epic mount, I have 300 GATHERING professions, and I have 2k gold sitting in my bag. It's beyond wrong
---
Yeah ive never ran into a warrior who didnt wait to pop BR. So I mean I guess it works in the scenario youre conjuring up, but thats just a bad warrior because hes popping his get out of jail free card when it isnt needed. Most of the time what will happen is your pet gets feared anyway since theyre expecting it.  
---
Again, yes, if you run into bad warriors/hunters youll take the W. But when you encounter someone who isnt braindead, youre going to lose 100% of the time.
---
Glad to see Blizz is following in Jagex’s footsteps.
---
I came home and Windows 8 was on my PC. I live alone. I didn't know that was possible 🤷‍♂️
---
Wotlk did have ammo, I started mid wrath and I remember having a guildmate run all they way to wetlands to give me ammo. I’ll never forget him, that’s when I truly fell in love with having community.
---
Madseason? Are you ok?
---
RIP BenderWaffles.
---
Well, to be fair, the post was about a warrior who could not fathom why non-mages were not doing mage things.
---
I find population a double edged sword. On one hand limited quest spawns can be pretty annoying. But a lot of quests do allow you to group up for a bit less annoyance (mostly killcount quests or those offering copies of unique quest loot like off of an elite). Additionally, I've found thus far that PUGs for quests tend to come pretty easy if you pay attention. Other than unpopular dungeons it's often pretty easy to get a group going for any given group-benefited quest in that zone within an hour, oftentimes faster. I've also run into quite a few situations where a PUG forms basically at the destination with people just coinciding at the right place at the right time.
---
Angry response from a bully! 
---
And I play pve for that exact reason. There is no common decency in pvp servers. It would be fair if the camper would be brought down to the lvl of the campee, otherwise is just bullies doing it. Just because is not against the rules doesn’t meant is the right thing to do.
---
Thank you, this comment was helpful.
---
All research I’ve done has pointed to 8+ being optimal. Arnold is obviously an exception to most guidelines lol
---
It affects only opposing-faction civilians (white target window) .
---
Most quest NPCs are not civillians.
---
I quit my sub just because I've not been using my free time for anything else and I need a break. Fully intend to come back at some point though.
---
As a hunter I whole heartedly encourage this practice, this isn't the hunter dream or anything.
---
Don't have a blue post, but there are other Reddit posts about it. I'm a Reddit amateur so I don't really know how to link them. But I'm sure they will be easy enough to find
---
That’s good we need more tanks, are you horde?
---
There’s a video of asmongold doing no shield tanking so others think they can do it..
---
I main a 43 hunter that I have taken pride in twinking out with leveling gear along the way.
---
I love showing up the AOE mages in SM and Ulda with DPS then giving them shit about it. I usually average just under double overall damage after a run compared to AOE mages. When aimed shot is criting for 1100 and multi shot is critting 2-3 times for 600+ blizzard can't really hang DPS wise.
---
"Spellcleave blows and you're losing in DPS to a huntard, quit being bad and start casting fkin frostbolt scrub. Or reroll, you're terrible at your class." Gets lots of reactions from mages lol
---
But I already have one combo point on an unmarked mob!
---
I was referring to women. Women, generally speaking, don’t like being reduced to their sexuality. Search around and you’ll find plenty of cases of women rightly complaining about just this topic. This is a pretty textbook case of it.
---
And I’m not saying don’t make sexy outfits. Have all the sexy, ironclad bikini armor you want. Just don’t make it such a blatant double standard when a male equips the exact same armor and it looks nothing alike
---
But at the same time, yes.
---
If you don't trust everyone in your party to do the right thing, the smart play is for everyone to Need, rather than 4 people Greed like gentlemen and the last guy Needs and ninjas it.
---
Represent friend.
---
I love this server.  It's like getting in on Sunday bowl day and choosing your own lane, but having someine beside you that likes to bowl too, and enjoys SHUTTING up when we're done talking....
---
Actually only rogues can get Elusiveness.
---
That's awesome, dude!
---
Yes. You have to pray to RNGesus before rolling on anything. Then you will win. I only wish RNGesus would answer my prayers more.
---
Sure man, glad to hear it
---
I think the phases are all but said and done in terms of definitely coming out, it's just a matter of the future of Classic or "after" Classic that's likely up in the air.
---
MikScrollingCombatText
---
I don't play wow, but this is universal.
---
You know that is all related to the populations of other realms. Say theres only 5 people on the most populated server, if theres 4 people on a different server itll say it is also high population
---
Same. Horde with basicbitch names on grobbulus... beware
---
Thanks! Was about to ask this myself! Looks fantastic!
---
&gt;	though they turn into banshees or valkyries instead.
---
Not necessarily. Sylvanas’ dark rangers are her former high elf rangers, and a few of the major death knights have been/are high elves
---
Dual spec would be a great addition
---
/
---
Rogues and warriors are way greedier with loot then hunters
---
What are you talking about? World first was a mage. And he primarily aoe farmed.
---
Look at the current 60s, mages have the most level 60s of any class. Even percentage wise relative to other classes, there are more lvl 60 mages.
---
Thank you.
---
I'm in the same boat as you!  Brand New to WoW and can't stop playing haha. I made an alliance account on Thunderfury, but my main is on Smoulderweb. I'll hit you up when I start playing my other account!!
---
oh man, it says; 
---
"* Ability to set notes for ignored entries, and expiration times for automatic removal from ignore"
---
I think that'll do perfectly. Heres a link for other people!
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/global-ignore-and-spam-filter-classic
---
No it doesnt. Tried it.
---
1) Blizzard is 50% more mana efficient than AE
---
2) There is a talent in frost tree that reduces threat from frost spells by 30%, which makes the difference in threat from AE / Blizz marginal.
---
3) You can get more DPS with AE but if you're drinking to replenish your entire mana bar after every pull, what's the point?
---
4) Like you said, if you're AoEing large groups you need the slow from Blizz to control the mobs
---
Ideally I use a combination of skills.. CoC -&gt; Frost Nova -&gt; Flamestrike -&gt; Blizzard -&gt; AE / CoC to mop up
---
Although I do sometimes spam Rank 1 AE to get clearcasting procs.
---
Nah five water is what like 10 silver?  Mages could charge like 25% of what water normally costs so 50 silver should be like a minimum fee lol.
---
If it was stated when recruiting members, fine. If he waited to tell everyone until they got to the dungeon, dick move.
---
Heal over Time aka Renew, Rejuvanation. Tapping = pressing Life Tap, locks exchange health for mana.
---
Building in the Beast Mastery tree is the ideal PvE spec before you get raid gear, which is when Marksman takes over as the top spec. If you're just starting out in MC/Ony, 5 points into Frenzy is ideal.
---
Thats what I am doing. I just say Tank LFG whatever. normal runs and perhaps do a couple
---
They can if the right minds are there that resonate with the original feel. Take for example, Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. They not only were true to the original movie in capturing its feel, but also surpassed what they could even do at the time. Now compare that series to the Neverending Story movie sequels done in the (90's?). Terrible, tacky, poor all around and quickly forgotten. It takes a lot of complexity to understand what people really love about something in order to properly expand on it. I honestly don't know if the current Blizzard team understands enough of the "what and why" to make a WoW +, but I will say this: You only get one more shot here, Blizz. Think long and hard.
---
MUL-
---
TI-
---
SHOT
---
PUGs really don't have to be toxic though.
---
I never have understood the “reserved” line of thinking over the years. It’s just so douchey, especially when you open it up to random players and classes that may need that item. It’s a very selfish approach, and there’s generally easier solutions...like don’t bring other classes that may need the item you want! Run it with friends who understand/don’t need! Run it with your guild. So many alternatives, yet so many people just go with being huge selfish bitches. Mind bottling.
---
Yeah this is a guy who doesn't player hunters clearly.
---
At rank 6 loyal a hunter pet can be 'unhappy' for literally HOURS before it will run away.
---
They are crimson silk shoulders made from tailoring and robe of power from tailoring too. But careful robe of power is BOP
---
With 4 mages, you're going to pretty much one or two shot every mob.
---
I find it easier to mange something like that than to try fancy things with ISBoxer.
---
It's a great keyboard for sure! Just takes a bit of time to get used to since the low-profile form factor has the keys spaced unlike most normal mechanical keyboards. Once you adjust though it's awesome.
---
Im not sure why you think i need to save face on an internet forum. I gave an example in which to duplicate the source video, and backed it up with my own experience and all youre saying is no without any emperical data? Im all for the prove me wrong front, but all youre do is saying no like those emotional participants
---
No, he didn't mention anything reserved in the world LFG chat and I wasted 20 min while he managed to get a full raid, after all that he just happens to mention that something is reserved, which I don't think it's okay.
---
When the PvP honor system comes out and people are dueling/fighting more, it will clearly separate good mages from bad. Nothing noob about how high the skill ceiling is for PvP mages, they can do some really neat things. That being said, so can hunters in PvP, it’s just that they’re both convenient which is why they get that noob hate.
---
ok. Some members were rank14 in Vanilla and on private servers AND some members have been rank 1 in Retail before.
---
Did revenge get nerfed threat wise?
---
As a tank, it is hard to hold aggro with 1 hand and shield at that  level. You just do way too little damage and have 0 hit gear. So you can either use a 2 hand, or try to get dps to respect your aggro limits, which is impossible. 
---
The tank in your group could have sucked. But consider that the alternative to him taking dmg may have been the other dps taking damage when they rip aggro.
---
Because we all tried to solo it first and speedily got ganked by 5 mobs at equal level. THEN we got someone else to help us.
---
Isn't Ravager from SM Armory better as well? You can get that before 40
---
It exceeded my expectations.
---
Vanilla Veteran, Heroic Raider from WoD - early BfA. Quit BfA a couple weeks after 8.1.
---
I was skeptical about how well Classic would keep my attention. Aside from the fact that I experienced most of the Classic content back in vanilla, I've been hooked on Warframe for quite a while. Even when I was still raiding in retail, I spent more time playing WF than WoW outside of raid nights, and Warframe is an incredibly fast-paced game, with silky smooth movement and combat flow. The prospect of going back to Vanilla's ridiculously slow pace of both movement and combat worried me. My RL friends were all super hyped though, so I figured I'd play with them for a bit and go back to WF when we eventually got bored.
---
Currently Level 47 Orc Rogue. While I don't quite have the drive to do long 6+ hour sessions like I did when I was a teenager playing Vanilla, the game has kept me hooked well enough to make steady progress. I'll probably go back to Warframe for Empyrean or The New War (whichever doesn't get delayed further), but for the moment I'm quite happy with Classic.
---
fyi its only used to pull mobs to you , cant auto shoot it
---
You can't have it both ways dude.
---
You can't go around telling people to shut up and stop complaining *while justifying your own right to complain about their complaining*
---
It's both or nothing.
---
A good solid cleave group for chain running dungeons is efficient and can be fun. It's not fun or interesting to me, personally, but I see the appeal.  
---
However, it seems that so many of these people have seen the streamers and youtubers doing such and have decided "Okay, I'm in a dungeon. AOE AOE AOE AOE AOE AOE."
---
Heartseeker is one (and probably the only one) where it's Alliance dominated after a massive surge of Alliance transfers. It's pretty much Herod/Skeram/Stalagg again but with reverse factions.
---
Wonder if they got rollback/gold/items confiscated..
---
While tanking in dungeons, you aren't going to be using MS very much. It's primarily a questing/DPS ability. If you want an MS tanking build, I would suggest 31-5-15 with you filling out the Arms tree to MS before getting the 5% crit in Fury and finally filling out the Prot tree.
---
I was farming some wool in that keep in the Barrens. Did managed to surprise few leveling players when they tried to get the quest done "to quickly" ;)
---
Lmao, you lost me with the very first line. It has everything to do with rushing.
---
Banning people who try to pay to win is a good thing. I feel zero sympathy for those who get banned for buying gold, cheating, hacking, exploiting, or taking other similar action. 
---
#NeedMoreBans!
---
Still having this weird graphical error. it's not FPS but my game field gets 'choppy', moreso in areas of concentrated players. Don't notice it out solo in world, see it a bit in dungeons, and a LOT in org/uc.  
---
if i enable vsync it mostly goes away but i hate how the game plays with vsync on. Tested all my addons individually and none of them cause it, and my graphics card driver is up to date.  
---
Any ideas?
---
You're seriously so talented! Thanks for another beautiful post

Hi, /u/Cob789

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9ruhh/cost_u_time_boy/). 
---
Why are you on reddit then, after all this subreddit has discord...oh right because it serves a different function. 
---
It is also ironic that the server discords would be better off with more realm forum use, because it turns out the realm forums contain the exact target population that the server discords do.
---
wrong. I throw a fish at my cat and he's back to normal.. Not a big inconvenience especially if you trained fishing
---
What did blizzard recently changed about BRD?
---
If everyone is a twink, no one is a twink.
---
Totally agreed. That's why in my realm I've never leaded group with reserved items and I am pretty good geared after all the fair roll way works!
---
People like you make me belive there is still ownest good WoW players!
---
Oh I never had to get help. Just use pots and bubbles.
---
The next part of the quest chain definitely required help though lol

Until I seen his old post, I didn't even know the roof thing was an exploit. 
---
I had done it on retail in WoD just before Legion. I would land on top of the cage and dot all the Horde that was cross realmed with Sargeras. I thought it was a clever way to avoid guards and keep my rep from going down. 
---
I haven't done it since, but I did do it on numerous occasions before Legion launched. I did it either with my Shadow Priest or Lock. 
---
I thought it wasn't a big deal since anyone with a flying mount could get up there and take me down. 
---
But now that I know because of his previous post, I absolutely will never do this again. I don't want to be banned or get a warning on my account.
---
I'd say living through the development and lore from Orcs &amp; Humans to World of Warcraft gives one an overall perspective that will be significantly different that someone who hasn't. And a lot of that in turn must draw on the rise in fantasy culture during the 70s and 80s that spawned Warhammer. 
---
But that doesn't mean new blood couldn't develop story and content in line with the ideal of classic WoW that remains true to the theme.
---
Run WC for venom strike, replace it in 10-15 levels
---
It's because everyone fucking bumrushed to 60 in 2 weeks and are bored out of their minds now. 
---
I was in a dungeon talking about how people zerging through 15-year-old content is going to spoil the game. People are going to get hungry and start asking for stuff while 90% of us who aren't on the forums are still at level 30.
---
I lucked out and got it in 2.5 runs. I used it until about 55 and then switched over to a blue. It kind of sucks because it's so fast. [Looks nice in my bank, at least.](https://i.imgur.com/oeB7U25.png)

Orc children are a thing
---
Yeah, i know its harder for warriors.  Just saying ive liked the groups ive been in with druids :)
---
I like to get small bits of work done during downtime while playing MMOs. All my work stuff is on the Mac side, and work is more important than gaming, so I'd rather play a game with actual Mac support than boot into Windows because the devs can't be bothered to fix their Mac client.
---
Again you think writing a lot means you have a point.  I believe the bard said verbosity is the soul of wit.
---
&gt; you add in crit chances, misses, dodges and parries and it’s better for a pet that does white damage to have a faster attack speed
---
You keep saying this but don't give any explanation why.  Probably because the explanation is a tepid understanding of math.
---
You go MM for Trueshot Aura not to boost your personal dps.  If all you care about is personal damage at the expense of raid dps then go 0/21/30.
---
All three of you mothafuckas got valid points, this is wild lol
---
Pandaren are the Jar Jar Binks of Warcraft.

Mine take less than 2 minutes, maybe it depends on the server size? I play on Thunderfury.

I could have sworn it worked when I tried it, maybe I hadn't been away long enough for the auto log out.

Last night my friend and I were questing in Arathi. We came across a few Horde, but let them all be, because they were just fishing and questing.
---
But suddenly a group of three popped out and tried to gank us 3v2, because the Horde never attack when it's an even fight. But they were terrible and my friend and I killed all 3 despite their druid being 5 levels above us.
---
Then we moved to the Yeti cave and peacefully did our quest, that is until a hunter thought I was by myself and tried to gank me. So we had to kill all the horde in the cave.
---
Moral of the story, Horde players never think ahead it seems.
---
Sure, ban those who are cheating, I just hope blizzard doesn't go overboard as usual and ban people who have more than X amount in the bank.
---
I tanked a group for the first time last night. The pain is real.
---
&gt;Can't believe that they didn't release BGs in phase 1.
---
IMO BGs being in phase 3 is a HUGE mistake, the largest one they've made I'd say.  Phase 3 is just really fucking far away (in all likelihood) to hold out such a core element of the game.  It's far enough away that you're going to get non-insignificant portion of the player base sitting around wishing they were there for quite a while before they drop.
---
So there's no reason, got it.
---
You didn't kill them. For all you know they came back as soon as they went out of sight.
---
Yeah but have you tried leveling a prot warrior? Lol
---
True but it's not enough of a dick move to slander him on a Reddit thread. That's also a dick move
---
ho'kay... stahp dots...

A free month of game time too. Class act!

This post was made by PVP server gang
---
Marley and me
---
I think you might actually prefer a Warlock. Superb PVP and high skill ceiling to pull off crazy stunts in PVE and PVP.
---
All of you are my bitches as far as I'm concerned. I die, we all die
---
You can, but for an inexperienced player, you probably won't, particularly against more experienced players.
---
You're not going to magically make PVP fun for people who don't like PVP.  If you're getting spawn camped you aren't "learning" from your experience.
---
What are you two talking about?
---
Used a staff that dropped from BFD I think that had 30ish dps. I got the bonebiter at 35 and you really chonk things down at that level with that weapon.
---
Gotta flex my style on them axe peasants
---
You might wanna look up that big word you used because you're not using it correctly :)
---
I kill on sight unless the horde is more than 4 levels above me or they outnumber me. Winning most my fights as a ret paladin too.
---
Anime on 2nd monitor. Say "woops" when someone dies. The usual
---
I can't fucking stand the term 'Spellcleave'. 
---
It's stupid.
---
There, I said it.
---
On a side note I encourage all my tanks to two hand. Stuff dies faster, they get more agro, healing is easy anyway.
---
I’m a simple man, I see a classic journey post from Valdihr, I upvote
---
Keep in mind that the Felhunter is amazing for pvp! I forget exactly what it’s called but it consumes dots and regens health iirc
---
Because it's actually true in real life.
---
Do people actually fury tank while leveling???
---
Looking great, dude!
---
There's a huuuuuge difference between 2h arms 'tanking' and S&amp;B arms tanking. So many warriors who don't taunt, go defensive for large/accidental pulls, CC, mark, or even debuff.  
---
As a healer, I can tell you if I can concentrate my healing into one person, be able to predict how much damage and when they'll take it, and not have to oom myself healing the warrior, mage, and spriest (who always fucking instists on Mind Blasting on pull and probably doesn't have fade on their bars), I wouldn't have to drink for so long and the run would go so much faster.
---
So you don’t even use MS huh? You’ve been going arms Fury hybrid. I enjoy tanking a lot so far, but still do some solo leveling. That’s why I figured I could go 50/50 arms prot and get both worlds, but no ‘Final’ skill. Just want to be sure I’m not making things harder on myself.
---
This is a weird, sad, strawman argument people trot out sometimes where they like to try to pretend that people think events inside a video game are actually "really happening", or other such poppycock.
---
There is no separation between "I am sat at home playing a game" and "I am existing in the REAL WORLD". Your game exists in the real world. At no point during your 70-80 years of existence will you ever STOP existing "in the real world", because it's the only world you'll ever know. The person behind the keyboard is real. They're a real person, engaged in a real recreational activity. If you're being a dick for the purposes of enraging them and contributing to your own amusement, it's no "less real" than if you did it during a game of pick up basketball at the park, or over a chess board, or at trivial pursuit night. Your characters exist in a virtual place, the person you're trying to piss off does not. If you can't make THAT distinction, then I know exactly what to tell you. "You are being willfully obtuse to try and win an argument on the internet".
---
I like it that a hunter posted this. And obviously the hunter dying is way worse for him than having his pet killed a couple of times.
---
I re-up’d
---
maybe it’s because that’s a more effective way to play the game
---
Two questions: what’s your /played and what do *you* consider hardcore? Because from where I’m sitting, anyone who is 60 has basically been working a part time job... that’s pretty hardcore
---
It is significantly better. And if you're not a casual cheapskate then you won't mind paying 400-600gold for an item which will last you a year maybe. Wearing Exalted Robes as a priest just tells if everyone you're a cheap slacker.
---
Set correct date in bios
---
no, you can't, it's not possible to get darnassus rep to exalted with just questing - all the guides on the internet for getting exalted at level 40 are using reputation values from TBC when they doubled the rep gains
---
i have tried it myself :(
---
Yea why are there no baby Taurens?!
---
Damn why everyone on this sub gotta be like this? My man just shared what basically amounts to an opinion and you just gotta roll up being like that.
---
She is now on my KOS list. Thank you.
---
Yeah, I predicted this kind of shit, that’s why I rolled on an RPPVP server. People are way nicer, with fewer try-hards.
---
Well then you are doing something seriously wrong in your life. Even at minimum wage (10€/h) everyone can do just fine on 40 hour weeks. And if you are even in a halfway beneficial situation, you will either earn a lot more than minimum wage or have ways to mitigate it.
---
I for example could easily stay afloat working 20 hour weeks on minimum wage for the rest of my life.
---
Why would server population be relative to the population of other realms? That makes no sense at all.
---
Blizzard already said that low/medium/high of Classic is much higher than low/medium/high back in 2005, that alone disproves what you're saying. Realm population is based on a static number ("full"), not relative to the other realms.
---
Well, he implied that against a boss with 315 defense you need 9%, which is true with 300 weapon skill, but that's not necessarily the case for a rogue.  Getting to 9% hit is not absolutely necessary for a combat rogue or any rogue with 305 weapon skill, as the hit cap is 6% in that case.
---
I feel like this is more of a jokey kind of thing than legitimate advice.
---
Oh well, you made your choice.
---
But reddit told me that alliance are all good boys who would never DARE to hurt a fly!!
---
No I actually can. Like I said this is a discussion. People can say whatever they want. I can tell them to stop bitching, and you can tell me to stop bitching about them bitching. Do we really need to continue this any further?
---
We all roll and the rogue unlocks it.
---
Nothing is stopping a rogue from saying their lock picking is too low and coming back later. Sketchy, but no one will ever know.
---
Think about it like this. Yes, you can unlock it, but as a group, you cleared the dungeon. Without each other, no one would even have a chance.
---
I feel like this is fake but whatever. Spellcleave isn’t going away no matter how bad you want it to
---
Ah thank god I play on EU and never have to worry about shit like that
---
Free action doesn't stop sheep.
---
Sheep&gt;wait off pot&gt; murder them is a basic mage thing
---
Woosh.
---
I was doing The Annals of Darrowshire in WPL with 2 horde. We would take turns looting books and killing off the asshole ghosts that kept spawning. I got a whisper from a (nearby?) rogue saying we should jump them. 
---
I told him no. He jumped them anyway when they had low health. The 2 horde beat the shit out of him. He died. We laughed. They finished their quest. I was left alone. I then got gangbanged by ghosts.
---
Good fun. 
---
Eventually, the correct book did spawn, though.

So is your brother a blood elf... or?

Formula for players (for abilities): 
---
    MissChance = 5% + (PlayerDefense - AttackerSkill) * 0.04%

Ouch, haha
---
I remember there was a girl in TBC who did this, sold her body for an epic flying mount.
---
I bet a lot of them get money from streaming and sponsoring, so this is nothing new.
---
&gt; Games are spaces where the conceit of the separate virtual world allows for experimentation with (anti)social behaviors in an environment where the stakes are very low. This can allow people to safely express a side of themselves that isn't possible or acceptable in meatspace.
---
I'm sorry, is your argument actually "thanks to the stakes being low, this is a relatively safe space for me to express the anti-social dickhead side of myself"?
---
I just want to get some clarity here, in case I'm misunderstanding exactly what form of self expression you're yearning for that you feel regular society denies you.
---
&gt;I'd go so far as to say that having some proportion of players who are competitive/disruptive to interact with enhances my experience.
---
We're not really talking about competitive disruption, that's just functional PvP. We're talking about aggressively anti-social behaviors. Even the OP is backing off his "don't bop the low health enemy" stance.
---
I was about to say....
---
Tried to use my raidicon macro to mark an enemy player the other day, game threw an error saying something along the lines of "This can not be used on this target.".
---
So either I screwed it up, or you can not put raidicons on enemys?
---
Just cuz you’re 12 doesn’t mean people at 25 that actually played this game from the start are boomers
---
My PERSONAL experience - Warriors are easier to keep alive as they have a lot more +def rating gear they can get. Bears cannot. 5 mans, Bears are superior to Warriors in threat and take about the same amount of dmg. In raids however - crushing blows is a real threat to a bear. Bears can be used in MC/Ony but im not sure they can handle BWL+ very well.
---
I have 8 characters but 4 of them are just holding names that ill use for when i start playing on the horde side. For now i got 3 that i am leveling together, and 1 bank alt.
---
Ahh interesting thanks for explaining.
---
I am fond of pigs.
---
I rolled out on Bloodsail from the start, and I haven’t regretted it.  Bring an alt, before you know it, it’ll be your main and those 39 levels will be forgotten.  (Alliance side; no idea what the Horde side is like.)
---
That’s stupid. What about classes that can’t aoe farm? Then they don’t aoe farm.
---
What about hunters and warlocks able to solo high elites? What about rogues able to stealth through dungeons and skip bosses? What about certain classes not needing to buy a mount?
---
&gt;Only when publicly called out it seems... why do we never see a post “i got wronged by GM, I submitted report and got apology and GM fixed my issue!” Type of posts?
---
Part of it might be that the people who would make such a post are the same people who would make a post right after they run into issues.
---
But publicity certainly helps with customer support issues.
---
Wait wait wait...the horde never attack when it's an even fight - and then you complain about the hunter attacking you by himself?
---
Which is it?
---
'stick on em'
---
Was there for precisely this purpose.
---
From my experience:  
---
AOE/Cleave groups = Clusterfucks with constant deaths.
---
Normal groups = Smooth, easy going fast runs.
---
There's something satisfying about fucking up someone's attempt at cooperating with the enemy too
---
Ah yeah that is a good point, I am sure that makes the process take quadruple the time a cgi liveaction hybrid would take.
---
Yeah, sums up the OCE server too tbh
---
This is one thing that has for the most part remained the same about blizzard since classic. They have always had pretty stellar customer service.
---
Work to rule like local unions in our schools
---
👀.... Is all I'm saying
---
What do you mean by crit capped on the hit table?
---
As an alliance, I won't lie to you saying I don't do that. Lol I'll feel bad if it's too easy.
---
You won’t see Rank 14 for awhile even after phase 2 hits.
---
How do you even buy gold? Is it like a hack thing where people sell infinite amounts of manufactured gold online or is like actually earned in-game and then sold online?
---
If they don't use defensive stance they are retarded, arms tanking allows for really reliable stance dancing cause you don't lose as much threat as long as you are specced into it.
---
how to have enough gold at 40 for your mount: 
---
1) get to level 39
---
2) farm 90g
---
3) ...
---
4) get a mount at 40
---
Atta boy
---
Its used as an interupt in pve. Which is always useful, plus if an add is kinda hanging in the back cause someone wont los you can gouge and have them passified for that duration.  Pretty neat ability imo, I love it
---
If your 2h tanks aren't keeping aggro, they're really fucking up, because the whole point of 2h tanking is to generate more rage/threat than sword and board tanks.
---
Sounds like it’s not so cheap.
---
Wtf, no. They have to be at 0% happiness for an extended period of time.
---
I see poop too!! We’re witnessing an optical illusion in the wild.

---
Death to the horde!
---
You're not the only one. I was summoning Echeyakee for a RL friend (alliance) to tame and some horde player was freaking out that I was helping an alliance player and stealing the mob from him.
---
Literally could accomplish this with 80 random people in boot camp
---
Is following commands really that difficult for people?
---
Gz bra
---
That seems like a crazy amount of time are you hitting the double forward arrow like fast forward. I believe there are options to allocate more resources to it might give that a try. Scans for me take a min or so.
---
if it makes you feel better there’s nothing else for druids to do at 60
---
Yeah westfall goes between 10-7g depending on the day
---
Just running to un'goro in the slow hours and getting 10~ leather over an hour is slowly making me money
---
Wish I had RL friends that I could play with. In the 15 years none of them have fallen into the pit
---
It’s a great achievement to get but enjoy the levels, levelling through to 40 makes you appreciate getting the mount so much more.
---
It’s no race :)
---
The fact that this comment got so many upvotes shows how many ppl on reddit got no clue. Btw the rogue didn't even get the opener and druid is strong class against rogue don't know why ppl so amazed by this average gameplay
---
We first try for peace but when we are stabbed in the back, honour means little

But you wear a dress though
---
Which dungeons were severely nerfed?
---
Ever watch a mage fight a feral Druid?
---
If you're entering a contested zone that you are way too low of a level for, you do so at your own risk.
---
Step one: make a generic title about AoE somehow ruining the game
---
Step two: tell an anectode that has nothing to do with the title
---
Step three: ???
---
Heartseeker is high pop right now.
---
Yeah, just roll an alt over there and test the waters.
---
Stalagg or Heartseeker?
---
The correct answer is Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker
---
too bad it doesn't break poly...

wait.. it gets challenging when they have ravager and mortal strike ??

Ou that's cool! I forgot about nintendo points. I might have enough to get a reasonable discount on goose game.

I’ve heard myths of the legendary shaman tank but never seen it in action. Please tell of your rotation, and do you struggle with aoe aggro?
---
I don't know, one thing about retail I will admit to being pretty solid is the writing department. It's definitely a departure from the more low key writing of vanilla, but I've found the story to be fairly compelling for the most part. I still get pretty excited when there's a new cinematic, and I think Old Soldier has been one of the best cinematics of all time for Blizzard. Now, (war campaign finale spoiler ahead) &gt;!as far as sylvanas no scoping saurfang goes, I'm not so sure, but I'm willing to wait until they've fleshed it out a little more to pass judgement.!&lt; What I'm especially excited about is I feel that classic is going to allow the retail writing team alot more room to really push the envelope as far as plot goes, but time will tell how that plays out.
---
Bots mine it in-game and sell it, generally.
---
Is this the horde version?
---
I did this quest last night as alliance and I swear I got like 70-something silver from it. Might be a bug?
---
Huh. I've never actually seen a pet at 0% happiness. Always just 75%, 100% or 125%. Are you sure it's not 0 loyalty?
---
Rogues and warlocks can both cast blizzard in Hearthstone, so why not in WOW?
---
"oof, what a night... where am I?"
---
Just curious - what bosses are rogues skipping to? I have rolled a rogue to 60 and can’t remember doing that for any dungeons. Maybe the BRD boss that has the Barman Shanker? Can’t think of any others.
---
90% sure that if THAT is what you got from the OP that you are definitely part of the problem.
---
Wow thank you for the awesome advice.
---
After you sure?
---
Isn't it a vendor in Winterspring that only has a certain number available at a given time?
---
All I see in trade chat is rogues and druids doing carry runs for loot
---
You got wrecked, son.
---
cope
---
And then what? Meet some human rogue in the inn basement or something? Or a naked night elf hunter and just /trade?
---
No, unless your friendly neighbourhood Blacksmith just so happened to pay 75 g for it and you have the mats.
---
I actually had that back in classic, too. 
---
It doesn‘t make the run faster, but it makes the run easier since you usually built more threat.
---
Of course this means you are NOT just pulling everything at once, and it means using cc. And no going into the dungeon when you are 3+ levels below the boss.
---
Stops working after sunken temple, but for all those leveling dungeons it‘s a viable option to the good warriors.
---
I feel better knowing that it's a common and easy mistake to make. I'm also glad that I didn't send some raging messages and make the mistake even more embarrassing!
---
Doesn't exist for the most part in retail.  
---
Cause no one actually talks in retail.
---
There are hardcore guilds on every server that raid or farm every night. Avoid those unless you are able to play Wow as a 'job'.
---
There are plenty of guilds with 2-3 raid days, usually a 3-4h session in the evening.
---
If your class is overrepresented you might only get a subset of the total weekly raid days anyway.
---
Initially it might take your guild 2-3 runs to clear MC, eventually you clear MC and kill Onyxia the same night, clear BWL the second and third. 
---
At some point in a couple of months your raid will do MC with 15 mains that still need something....and 20 twinks or friends that are not in your regular raid, even fill the ranks through LFM.
---
So even for the most casual there will be a time in the future where he can kill Rag and Onyxia
---
the bad ones do. Also, the bad tanks can't tank.
---
F in 3 months when you lose a freezing band to a ninja
---
Cool
---
Generally you go to a sketchy website, pay $5-7/g then they'll mail it, or you place an item on the AH and they buy it like a stack of silk cloth for 40g or something
---
Pretty easy for blizzard to track, gets difficult when you sell 67x 1 silk cloth for like 60s each which while expensive isn't unheard of
---
[Vanilla's patch notes from launch (1.0) to 1.12](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759436454)
---
Dungeons, Raids nerfed
---
Items buffed
---
Classes buffed
---
I'm not saying 1.12 is retail easy, but it's significantly easier than early vanilla. Not to mention class balance in 1.12 was "better" than launch class. Warlock was a fucking joke in early vanilla in PvP especially.
---
You didnt get any attention 2h ago so you repost little Timmy? :(
---
Combination of AoE grinding and optimized questing route.
---
You are doing it right. Coc before nova is for solo aoe grind without speccing shatter, since you dont want to break nova before blizzard. Shatter is such strong talent all around otherwise, especialy in aoe groups since you will most likely chain novas with other mages. After experiencing like all mixes of classes in dungeon groups at 60, id never drop shatter. Altho i highly recommend to partner it with permafrost and threat dump talents (esp as solo mage in a group), this way you can dump your combo shortly after pull, even if u precast flamestrike without breaking agro most of the time, and even if u do most are moving very slowly so its easy for tank to reagro
---
Unless your raid only has like 3 priests.
---
Almost nobody had T3 going into BC from Vanilla.  Maybe one or two pieces, maybe...  QA40 gear sure (sans C'Thun which most people couldn't finish), but Nax was out for about 6 months before BC hit, and there were very few guilds that could clear that either.  It took a couple months before top guilds actually cleared it and by Sep/Oct nobody was even trying anymore because BC was coming.  So, my point is that very few people ever even saw the inside of Nax until Wrath, and practically no one had T3.
---
My tatic in PvP was to morph the hunter and kill the pet. Has worked okay for dules honestly. Probably would be better the other way though now that I think of it.
---
I play MHW on PS4...but I haven't even purchased Iceborne yet because Classic is taking up all of my personal time! First world problems!
---
Longer wait with the slower weapon, but you did more damage to make up for it.
---
If two weapons have the same DPS, the slower weapon will always have done more damage, because it did the damage first.  (Barring special abilities, of course).
---
You had me going in the first half, not gonna lie
---
&gt;Only when publicly called out it seems... why do we never see a post “i got wronged by GM, I submitted report and got apology and GM fixed my issue!” Type of posts? This is fandom, those posts would get upvoted way up. 
---
I think it's unfair to automatically make negative assumptions regarding this case when Blizzard has always been known for good CS. Myself and many others I know have had game time refunded for inactivity and even in game compensation for inconveniences/bugs. I even have one friend who sold his account as a dumbass in highschool and was able to get it merged in to his current account almost eight years later. Now the ethics of that are certainly questionable, as he claimed to be the victim of a hack, but no one had used the account since he sold it and I think it definitely speaks in favor of Blizzard CS.
---
Actually I went a variation of this, but I think leveling as ass/sub is awful in most cases. I made my own combat daggers build and run a dagger main (slower hard hitting) and a sword in my off, I've out DPSed every rogue in dungeons and don't struggle in many situations. I'm level 50 now but not slowing down yet.
---
dont worry that is the second time the first time is after 8 years of expansions
---
how's hunter leveling? I hear low downtime, but how easy is it? do i need to buy food/water often?
---
would have*
---
Yeah! It was Adriennes on Mankirk :)
---
nothing. they're just salty that they grind dungeons at half the xp/hour compared to spell cleave groups.
---
Spell cleave sux, yea I do it I main a mage. And some times it’s the only available group. It is a fast efficient effective way to get xp nothing more if done right.  Tho I would prefer “normal “ groups.
---
Heartseeker. First day it has been high pop 😄
---
with 2 decent mages, tank is not necessary.
---
I know what multi-boxing is, but no idea how this is normalizing multi-boxing
---
The Rivenspike debuff does not Stack with faerie fire. So its only really good as long as you have no druid in your raid. the annihilator procc does Stack with faerie fire though
---
Sometimes I join a party as DPS and let them spam for 10 minutes looking for a tank for an instance I tanked right before joining. Its a lot of fun I just have to be up for maintaining a high level of focus. Some times i just wanna stand behind things and punch them.
---
I forgot about that sword... the grind back in the day was real
---
your paladin privilege is talking.
---
I get this occasionally when my nets being slow. Just wait until it’s not peak traffic so the battlenet interface loads right and it’ll work.

Not sure where you got your info, but that's simply not true. Feel free to give that a read if youd like it explained
---
Also you apparently have to warn windows before you install a new mobo, who knew. It's a pain in the fuck to get your key reinstated if you don't have a CD key. Mine was a free upgrade from 8-10 so fuck if I know what my windows 8 key is from a decade ago
---
Some company hires out gold farmers to work for very cheap (usually 3rd world), gold farmers kill trash mobs/skin/solo dungeons/do whatever for raw gold, mail/trade gold to a stockpile account, company sells off stockpile accounts' gold (usually multiple of them).
---
Or the companies will just buy gold from players then resell it to other players at a higher price.
---
Back in the day, they'd just hijack accounts, but most people have authenticators now, so that probably isn't happening that often.
---
Okay how the fuck do pets work with the GMCC? I mind control things/people and I don't see any option to make them do anything. Is there some settings I need to check to have a pet action bar?
---
Yeah, i'd hate to be a mage or warrior once you hit end-game. Fighting over raid gear is going to be a huge pain while other classes basically get gear fed to them for not being meta. I think there's gonna be a lot of undergeared mages that eventually dont get played anymore after a while.
---
Sounds like total bullshit.
---
Lvl 40 mount is easy if you avoid levelling you crafting, have gathering professions and only buy talents you need. I am now lvl 57 and been super frugal as well as got some lucky BoE drops that I sold and have 350g so I would say fresh 60s with epic mounts is far more telling.
---
Even still, just level arms and keep a sword and board and learn your prot skills and you can do decent enough to get by most of the time.
---
They'll be back. 
---
For when they do, here's some tips to help fight bed bugs:
---
•They feed off of human blood. Slovenliness has nothing to do with them. Don't feel stigmatized.
---
•They can go without eating for 18 months. So forget about trying to starve them out.
---
•They like to live in the cracks and joints of wooden furniture/moldings, and under that little round ledge that runs around a mattress.
---
•They can't climb metal. Get your bed up off the floor onto a metal frame.
---
•"Sleep tight; don't let the bed bugs bite." is actually instructional. It means 'tuck your covers in so the bed bugs can't crawl up into your bed'.
---
•Extreme cold kills them. Freezing items will kill any bed bugs.
---
•Extreme heat kills them. Wrap stuff in a black trash bag and put it in the back of your car in the summer for a few weeks. 
---
•Direct hits of rubbing alcohol kills them. Put in a spray bottle and spray the cracks and joints of any wooden objects you want to keep. This should kill any inside the cracks/joints.
---
Good luck.
---
100%
---
Ah duh the rogue Druid combo makes total sense.
---
You're right. WoW is so super serious.    Gotta play by the made up rules so everyone will like me !!!
---
no it's not. spell cleave in classic predominantly means 3 mages. not just for AoE damage, but also for total control of the pull.
---
I lost an aurastone hammer to a 58 shaman :/
---
Report to win confirmed, we all work for Blizzard now.
---
I appreciate you shedding light on it! Like I mentioned finding info on this is tough especially as most of us never played on private servers! Thanks for adding on to this :)
---
Druids generate way higher ST theat
---
A lot of the hardcore players will:
---
A. Continue playing for phase 2 honor.
---
B. Continue playing to have an edge when BGs come.
---
C. Re-sub when BGs come.
---
A lot of players will be upset with the "slow" release, but it's definitely not a bad business move.
---

This has always been my experience since I started playing all those years ago and I've played both factions, horde will play friendly and then attack you the moment they have any kind of advantage.
---
I am now on a heavy horde server as an alliance and got sick of being rushed by 5 or more horde all the time, re-rolled rogue and try to 1 shot any horde I see regardless of whether they are 10 levels higher or lower, been having a great time ever since.
---
I'm probably on a few hit lists by now.
---
Again, a pretty pathetic strawman, but you do what you need to do buddy. Looks like you can't help but be a prick in general conversation, too. Almost like it's some kind of trend.
---
Yeah so they were being stupid and deserved it. It kinda sucks that some people can no longer say Naga on Twitch but get angry at the idiots who use it as a racial slur not the people enforcing the new rule.
---
DUDE ARE YOU ON BIGGLESWORTH?!? I think that was me, Donutlad, the warrior!!!
---
Was this on the Atiesh Realm?
---
the north spawn ive noticed is the most finicky from my experience it tends to deviate the most in comparison to the others
---
[I got you fam.](https://imgur.com/a/nCryrfJ)
---
Yes, I think having anti-social dickheads on my server makes it a more interesting place, that is exactly what I'm saying. I enjoy the opportunity to exist in a space where I have to deal with the possibility of other players being hostile.
---
First wave was roughly two weeks ago with people who started a sub for Character Creation / Name Reservation.
---
Being a mage myself I approve of this tactic
---
I just realized that Stonetalon Mountains zone looks like...a talon made of mountains!
---
The humans looked great, what are you talking about? Costume design was on point, and all main actors were good.
---
Brings back memories of high school.
---
Go 5/5 wand mastery, then shadow till around 35. After 35 you can spam dungeons grinds for levels and then it will be ok to go holy. Leveling as holy early game is Aids - Source: Leveled a Vanilla Priest as Holy.
---
He’s 34 and can’t do level 40-50 dungeons or even survive those zones to be helpful in summoning/get the flight paths that would make him useful.
---
you try AoE with 3 locks and then with 3 mages. the difference is night and day. spell cleave in classic means mages. it's not only about AoE, it's also about 100% control of the pull. Locks can't do that. Nobody but mages can. 
---
So when people look for a spell cleave group, it's 3+ mages (depends). It doesn't mean anyone who can AoE. It's specifically mages.
---
Me and a mage were about to do the captains chest quest in STV where you kill the elite giant. Undead warrior started killing crabs nearby and I wanted to hold off pulling till he left. He was taking his sweet time so I just pulled anyway and in comes the warrior charging right at us. 
---
I freaked for a second until I realized he charged the giant and was helping us kill him. That giant almost killed all three of us and if it wasn’t for our undead bro helping we would not have survived. Hats off to you my man, whoever you are.
---
If you just want to support your mage I would take skinning and either herbalist or mining.  The problem with non harvesting professions is they tend to be a gold/time sink to level.  So if the mage is your main and this is the alt then just grab everything you can and sell it so that those profits can go towards your main.  Eventually at 60 you can probably drop skinning and pick up another profession that will be way quicker to level at max.
---
The dps is merely average. The damage range is poor, and the proc is useless for PVE outside of the additional damage. It's outshone by blues in BRD.
---
Ditch WINE and install Lutris. Check out Lutris.org and read the directions (it has dependencies like gnu-wine or something).
---
There's also a defense Blizz set up for the DDoS attacks that killed Linux boxes from accessing servers, so you have to change your TTL on packets to 80. If you get to the Realm select screen and keep DCing I'll find that post for you
---
because his doesn't make sense. If you're killed you have to run to your body which takes multiple minutes, and you res at half health and mana and have to eat and drink. If he kills your pet all you do is res it and feed it then drink. Literally takes 30 seconds so I can't even fathom how it annoys someone more to waste 30 seconds of time compared to multiple minutes.
---
Yes. As a rogue, I feel I should say sorry for all the times I have sapped a hunter, and then killed his pet. Then waited for him to revive and repeat it. 
---
Only twice tho, I don’t camp people. Unless they attack first.
---
Gatorbite axe is a level 48 3.2 AS weapon with 13 higher top end. The Chief's Enforcer from the same dungeon as Sul'Thraze is a 3.4 AS level 45 staff with 15 higher top end. Sul'Thraze is still better than either of those two because the DPS is just that much higher, but it has worse AoE damage and its mortal strikes hit for far less.
---
ST is a sick weapon, it's just not that good...
---
Am i missing the joke or smt?
---
Sorry dude! Unfortunately this was all the information I had and I wanted to share it because everyone guards like crazy!! Like most I didn't play private servers and a video like this would have helped me a TONNE! But as others have above sharing the knowledge appose to just bringing nothing to the table I'm sure would be GREATLY appreciated by so many people! :)
---
Are you for fucking real, its literally all I've seen since launch
---
I don't really have a guide to recommend, I've just been playing one since vanilla.
---
Best advice I can give you is:
---
1. Learn all your abilities and what they do.
---
2. Learn *other* classes abilities.. primarily the ones they use against you. That way you won't try killing a warrior with retaliation up or CCing a big red hunters pet.
---
3. When you lose, pay attention. *What* killed you? You get nothing from saying "oh that was bullshit" and moving on. What did they do that stopped you from killing them? For example most classes priority will always be to put a bleed or a DoT on us.. something to prevent stealth. This is why many rogues opt for stunlock instead of outright damage... it takes a bit longer but you can disengage any time you like.
---
4. Learn common tactics. For example a mage will almost always blink immediately upon being attacked.. right out of your cheap shot, wasting it. And if you give them a chance to polymorph you, you're probably dead. So instead, open with an Ambush and then immediately sprint (especially if they freeze you to the ground) and rush them. Gouge whatever spell they're casting and then go to town. Or for next level fun wait for them to be facing a wall instead and watch them blink right in to it!
---
5. Don't neglect blind. Blind gives you enough time to bandage up *and* reenter stealth. It's extremely valuable and nowhere near enough rogues use it properly.
---
As for going up against groups, basically look for a weak link. If their healer sits down to drink, delete them. Ambush/BS/evis and they're probably dead. Vanish **immediately** or you will die as everyone else runs over... give them a few seconds to break apart then pick the next most weakest person. Maybe sap someone then sprint off to attack someone else. Stealth is your weapon, if you are caught in the open you are going to die.
---
Rogues are tons of fun, just keep playing and keep stabbing and you'll have a great time!
---
good luck lol
---
Do more JT movies work **for** or **against** you?
---
when you can get double or more xp/hour... why are you surprised?
---
I thought I was the only one. I get to the point where I’ve put in a few hours and I’m like hmmmm do I really want to invest more time with this guy?
---
Re-roll.
---
After 5 characters I’ve put my foot down and I’m playing the character I didn’t want to play initially because it’s who I was 10+ years ago.
---
I don’t know why but I’m just a Human Paladin kind of guy. I love running around helping people. Reviving them. Throwing them heals. Always offering to be someone’s pocket healer on a quest etc.
---
It’s not the most interesting class to me but it’s the most enjoyable.
---
Until you realize its from an npc and no one loves you haha - jp, it was funny I got one too
---
One of those things is not like the other, but if you enjoy both more power to you. Fill yer boots.
---
The WC bow is better sadly
