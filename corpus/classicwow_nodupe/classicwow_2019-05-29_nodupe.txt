Thank you for your efforts in the community :)

You say “omg someone let a warrior build sulfuras??”
---
Revenge: easily your best threat builder, you use this every time you can while tanking no matter what the spec. Do invest in extra ranks since both the damage and base threat increase.
---

---
Mocking Blow: It's an emergency taunt on a much longer cool down. Good tanks will stance dance to battle stance for this if a key taunt is resisted. Also good for questing groups or when you're dpsing to taunt mobs without having to pop into def stance. Problem with this from fury spec is that you won't have 2 points in TM will late 40s, so it's not AS good as it could be till then, but if you're tanking you'll generate 10 rage after dancing real quick just by getting eat up. No need to buy extra ranks past 1 till you can afford it.
---
Rend: This skill is actually pretty efficient damage from 1-30 or so, particularly if you're using a fat 2hander since rend damage can be the difference between waiting for another swing to do a tiny chunk of damage vs the mob just dying. At that point, even with later patches letting rend scale with attack power, it starts to get really bad. You actively do not want to use the skill in groups since a dot on the mob means you can't CC them, and the damage just isn't worth it.
---
Slam: There are some 2hander builds that use slam to great effect. Much better with fat slow weapons. Effective use of slam requires both a swing timer and a feel for mob attack speed, since a huge problem with slam is that it is interruptible. If you're dpsing slam is actually a better rage dump than MS or BT baring insane levels of buffing, but for max effectiveness somebody else should be tanking the mob. You can get away with not investing in this skill since it's usage is so awkward. Blizzard nerfed slam to shit during beta thanks to the Indalamar video and never really recovered for the lifespan of vanilla.
---
Sounds like Huntard is for you!
---
It took me a week or two after being on the sub. It's definitely been something I've though of and remembered throughout the years, fairly often, but I've been away from the game for a while. I probably think about it a lot more than most of the other guildies, honestly, it was such a long time ago and people move on. There was also a lot of drama involved despite all the fun and success we had, another reason I don't think back too often to those times.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It was definitely the peak of my WoW experience, though I did have a lot of fun on and off in later expansions (I quit about a year and a half into vanilla, came back a bit for Wrath, some WoD and the beginning of Legion)
---
Hunter, dawg.
---
It's hugely rewarding.  The gear really makes a difference in vanilla.
---
www.vanillafriends.com
---
I assumed level 60, fair enough :P
---
holy smokes, thanks for those links. I've looked through that wiki page the last time I was searching for addon resources but that API page is a new one for me. I feel like that's exactly what I needed. Thanks!
---
Yea? We're talking about bursting people in pvp to be like Unbreakable, right? Ele does that but with actual consistency.
---
Yea thats true! Orcs dont look half bad, either.
---
I think you mean mIRC, everything else was for plebs
---
I second this, I had a Female Dwarf Paladin forever ago and loved her for this reason.
---
I was thinking about making a video of my next mod.  I chose not to do it on this one since it was my first time ever doing anything like it.
---
Hunter is a class that's easy to learn and hard to master. You could spot a noob hunter a mile away because they'd keyboard-rotate or backpeddle in pvp or send their pet into the fray in a group, sometimes drawing tons of aggro. while wearing a mishmash of gear and looking like Sinbad in the 90s.
---
My first main was an orc hunter on Archimonde. I was 15 and also kind of a casual player and the stereotype of hunters rolling on everything is accurate. You get benefits from agility and intellect but you also want decent AP and a lot of hunters fallaciously think they need strength since theres a fair bit of melee in early pve (plus what if I need to melee in pvp for like 2 seconds?!) and they can eventually dual-wield which further makes it seem reasonable to roll on weapons and want to gain some strength, or just anything to get some more agility and intellect. Although I consider this fair play because rogues and warrors roll on ranged weapons all the time which used to drive me crazy. 
---
 Since you're mostly in a group to pull and kite there's lots of people who would prefer a mage or rogue for dps and let a war or rogue pull since they can equip ranged weapons. For dps a mage is often preferred although hunters can keep the damage coming longer and more steadily since they don't exhaust their mana as quickly and generate less threat. Also before everyone could just watch tutorials on dungeons, Eyes of the Beast was a valid method of scouting if no rogue was present and Eagle Eye is very handy in pvp and pve.
---
Also vanilla pets had different stats and abilities so you could do some cool/rage inducing things in pvp. In WSG you're second only to druids for flag-running using aspect of the cheetah which gives you a 30% speed boost. You also have some pretty good CC with traps and for whatever reason people often panic when facing off against both pet and hunter, hilariously focusing on trying to take out the pet first. Add engineering gear and hunters are just OP as fuck in pvp.
---
There's no better class for soloing, since you have your own tank, good dps, and if push comes to shove you just feign death. Also leatherworking and skinning will provide you with all the gear you need more or less up to 60. 
---
When I tried WoW again in 2017 I absolutely hated the changes they made to hunters. No melee at all? No deadzone? No level 10 pet quest? They took all the fun out of it. 
---
If you end up in a good guild and you know how to pull and kite in raids then you have a shot at getting some epics but noones going to be spamming LFG for a hunter. Also it gets tiring when literally everyone thinks they have higher gear priority than you do, esp if there's a shaman or rogue in your group. 
---
TL;DR I loved my hunter and was pretty deadly in pvp but everyone assumes you're a noob or a ninja looter.
---
stick em with the pointy end
---
So Pservers overtune the dungeons? I wonder how this will affect raiding.
---
Holypaladin.
---
Team up with a good hunter or warrior and spamcleanse freedom heal his ass. No one can kill you anyway, and if it's hard bubble up.
---
PvE you downrank spamheal and buff up. Not hard.
---
I hear you man. I was sad to hear they weren't going to make the cut.
---
I find it's not so much the content that most parents object to, but the way children obsess over whatever's holding their interest.  
---
Fortnite, for example. I played it a bit and enjoyed it, I stopped because I found the level of skill disparity too much and I don't have enough free time to play enough to get better.  
---
BUT, I drive school busses, and listening to the constant idiotic fanboy obsession day after day after day, I intend to never play that fucking game again and send anyone that wants to talk about it down the back of the bus so I dont have to hear any of it.
---
Oh neat. I'll check that out!
---
Got a favorite? I'd like to read something before release but would only have time for 1-2 tops.
---
Can i assume you did this back in vanilla? I mean, it's all a preference really. Some actually rather want armored mounts but there's also those that just want exclusivity for exclusivitys sake. Personally i enjoy my mount not covered in armor.
---
Average leveling time at the end of vanilla was 10-12 days played depending on class.  So 260-300ish hours.
---
So at 35 hours a week, that is about in line with what the tool told you, especially if you aren't speed leveling in any way (no instance runs, know where to go and when to head there, have no random downtime for fun, etc.).
---
This would almost make sense if the alliance could actually kill them
---
I thought the unarmored mounts would be cool to re-incorporate in some way. I'm not sure that making them a one-time exclusive fits within the long-term scope of Classic, though. Assuming we won't be getting any resetting servers or new servers every few years it doesn't make sense to me to present a museum piece that will eventually sit there, static and unchanging, and 5+ years down the road newcomers see the two people left on the server who have one of these mounts that they can never obtain.
---
In an evolving game this kind of thing makes sense. But Classic isn't an evolving game, and we have to stop thinking about it as a two-year blip before the server implodes because C&amp;D or drama, or it progresses to the next expansion, because it won't.
---
I would have liked to see the unarmored mounts make a very occasional appearance, say ever few years. I want Classic to be an ongoing, living thing that attracts and appeals to new players so they can experience what I experienced. To that end, I want newcomers 5 years down the road to have a brief shot at these mounts, or the AQ war effort (not necessarily titles/rewards, but the event itself), and things like that.
---
My opinion is all-or-nothing with the unarmored mounts, because I think we need to keep the long-term in mind here and not our own instant gratification and "so what if noobs down the road don't get the full experience, I just want mine" attitude should be checked at the door on this one. This isn't an evolving game, this is a static world state that people should be able to re-experience at some point.
---
I played near the end of Vanilla. I remember the Naxx patch and I stopped playing before BC. Never made it to lvl 30 iirc. 
---
Later came back during Wrath and raiding seriously from ToC to Firelands in Cata. I’m excited to start raiding again.
---
This is going to be a controversial one, but Horde Paladin and Alliance Shaman. 
---
Part of the reason these classes felt ignored and intentionally weak in many areas was faction balance. (We can get into the Hybrid Tax and its inconsistent severity in another thread) In PvE content, they were both primary healers with crucial buffs, and with a few notable exceptions those buffs mirrored each other in result. 
---
While asymmetrical faction design is interesting, it wasn't in practice all that asymmetrical. Homogenizing faction balance in this case is actually the first step towards unique and compelling class design.
---
Dark edge and Severance both outclass any sword outside ashbringer
---
depends what makes you feel good.
---
Make a premade WSG team with 7 hunters and 3 druids. We did this with alt hunters just messing around one day and found out it’s really good. Just have an assist macro and watch people fall over instantly as the hunters just mow people down in succession.
---
Also watching healers try to heal with 7 hunter pets eating them alive is pretty funny.
---
just leave the channel lol, is that too hard for you?
---
Don't want to deal with people then just leave the channel you have all the power.
---
&gt; yes taunt resist happens.. way too often 
---
And always at the worse possible time. I always imagined a GM sitting somewhere watching my game and making a taunt/mocking blow miss just for lolz.
---
Mage for sure, just mash frostbolt
---
There will be /world at start but it’s only a matter of time before someone locks it. 
---
On private servers /world is a default channel.
---
dual spec is also a HUGE gold sink for the economy. It helps keeps prices where they should be by combating inflation. I'm considering a pvp healing spec full time (even in raids) to avoid respec fees, but I still can't farm efficiently. Dual spec turns everyone into capable gold farmers when normally healers/tanks can't. So you have to loss of respec fees + increased farming ability by adding dual spec.
---
God I remember doing a LBRS the other night with a Priest in some T 2 and just his Renews could offset my Life Taps. It’s unreal how so many healers just ignore DPS and focus on the tank, like guy your mana is barely gone and the tank is fine just throw me something so I can actually blow shit away with my Shadowbolts.
---
Super hope they reported this as a bug in the tracker!  That would be extremely frustrating.
---
I remember the day they did this. Everyone just rushed in as a whole blob. It was weird, AV never felt the same again
---
This is on a Pserver or beta? Because in the beta it’s a lot easier.
---
Yes, it should be awarded to all who ring the gong even 10 years after the gates open.
---
I'm planning to play a bunch of characters and just wander around and have a good time with no rush to get anywhere in particular.
---
Yea, 10-12 days played was the average depending on class, with hunters being the 10.  But 10 days played is still 240~ hours, which the tool is taking into account on the normal setting.  
---
The normal setting is accurate in relation to the average.  The others are up for debate.
---
No one gonna mention Halo Zero that fan made gem?
---
Can mages cast portals to have ppl accidently click on them?
---
Rotflol
---
The only name I recognize on that list is Longarms 😂😂 earthen ring represent!
---
You will destroy people in PVP with hunter. You'll usually get the jump on them because you should be periodically tracking humans, and you can just aimed shot them from max range through some natural world geometry (firing through objects) as your pet goes to town, they're half dead before they can even react properly
---
I'll add this, feigning death at the right time will mess up their rotation as they'll lose you as a target
---
My god they were an incredible convenience. I loved everything about them and how they gave me the freedom as an enchanter to play the AH and make money on my own time. 
---
It wasn't until well after I fell out of love with the profession, and then the game, that I realized how they killed the unique social aspect of that profession, as other responders have pointed out. I still remember the enchanters I went to for most things before I picked it up myself. I can't tell you who made my potions.
---
Hey, no. Thee are no mogs in classic.
---
Bah no one I remember is there.
---
whoa brah, why they gotta be APES?!
---
I have lost all taste for private realms now that I have had a taste of the stress test. I am instead just going to read the WoW Developer Diary by John Staats instead.
---
Honestly, this is the one.
---
OH! You're right. Wow, it's been a long time. I had a friend that ended up getting both swords and thus getting the epic. Being the youngsters that we were, we both thought it was so crazy that he had gotten an epic. Good times. 
---
He was a Hunter, which makes it all the more funny after seeing the Hunter memes on this sub.
---
&gt; The totem quest lines are a serious pain.
---
Only the water one is a pain, and that's just because of the travel time. If you want to, it's totally fine to skip it until you have your mount at 40, then it's not that bad.
---
Even with the water quest though, I think they're awesome. You get to go see some neat, tucked away places that the other classes have no reason to visit, you get to take drugs and see some elementals that nobody else can see, and you really feel like a shaman for doing them.
---
I'm planning on maining a warlock but once I have time to toy around with leveling an alt, it will 100% be a shaman. They're the two most flavorful classes in classic, imo.
---
Lots of people "played" vanilla, as in they played on their parents or older siblings account for a little bit and never raided or got to 60.  Make a poll for people who killed Nefarian in vanilla and it would be much lower.
---
You couldnt find the first link in google while typing transmogrification? k
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Transmogrification
---
First sentence of the link
---
&gt;Transmogrification is a feature released with Patch 4.3.0[1] that players can access via an ethereal Transmogrifier NPC. It allows players to alter the appearance of their weapons and armor for a fee (in gold).
---
Yes, I did it when armored mounts first came out, and far fewer people had them at the time than the unarmored variety.  It was a tough decision that I immediately regretted and have ever since.  It was the sole reason I did the Exalted grind with Undercity through cloth turnins so I could be a troll on an undead horsey, but it did not help.  Nor has any other rare mount I've obtained.
---
Hunters are amazing. Idk? I was a hunter in vanilla.
---
I've been playing Diablo season 17. It's kept me pretty occupied.
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
Sure, but you went for warlord....and you don’t have intimate knowledge of the map. I’ve spent far less time in STV than you would have in WSG and I can visualize individual hills and the root systems from trees in that zone.
---
Nope!!! You get to experience the hobo to clown to hero look evolution !!!
---
We used to put ourselves in circle around the head with my guild. Then everyone will Hearthstone together to Kargath to go try and kill that motherfucker Ragnaros!
---
im a masochist so im going 31 disc, 20 holy as my hybrid spec. 2 points into searing light will carry me through dw about it
---
I hate to be that guy, but it was possible to do in Vanilla. #nochanges and all that.
---
18 points in all three paladin trees I guess.
---
The only way to do this the right way, blizzard will never figure out. There’s only 2 ways, either horizontal content added (more quests, new zones ZG equivalent difficulty raids), or vertical (Post Naxx content, spanning an ininite amount of difficulty)....The cons of horizontal content are that it will adulterAte the vanilla experience, to the point where the META will be changed. The cons of ULTRA-vertical, well there are none just infinite progress forever challenging playerbase
---
True story: 
---
Four years ago, I threw $100 at the Shenmue III kickstarter. I loved the first two games, was excited at the chance to see another sequel. 
---
Years went by, progress was slow, no news of a release date. (remind you of anything?) 
---
Finally, they start demoing the game. A release date is announced. 
---
August 27, 2019. 
---
Like, seriously? I wait years for both these games and they're coming out *the same day*?
---
Anyone nice enough to make a script for this? I'd rather never see his mongoloid face ever.
---
I suspect it will fill up more as time goes by.
---
Exact same plan.
---
Hell yeah brother 🤟
---
Fair enough. Just seemed odd I suppose!
---
tbh the hard to get loot in most cases looks the best
---
you sort of want people to see you in the best gear you have
---
Thanks for the link! Google isn't my default search, so I guess Its my fault. Appreciate it.
---
Transmogrification was added in patch 4.3, otherwise known as the Hour of Twilight.
---
This.
---
I love the last guardian, world of Warcraft lore is fantastic.
---
So where do you guys get adderall from asking for a friend
---
Yeah it doesn't bother me at all tbh. I cant wait to play either way!
---
Thank you! That's really helpful. :)
---
And what level range do you mean by "higher level quests?"
---
The price of a soda has doubled since then, and lots of other items 🤷🏻‍♂️ yeah, it’s more like $25 but close enough!
---
I think it might be worth noting that bringing consumables or more than what’s required can also really set you apart in that case
---
There is no reason to be an ass about it. The guy asked a question. Don't answer if you have nothing nice to say.
---
lol
---
Do u get the euphoric high with vyvanse?
---
I agree with you, but holy does not crush undeads on pvp.  I mean, not by their own hands.
---
Unless you are druid tank, then you have the privilege to stay clown/hobo while raiding
---
almost every rogue uses vanish to break frost nova regardless of race, every rogue worth their salt is going to be using prep as well
---
it's not as good as other racials
---
your starting point was awful btw
---
Clearly Pokimane can contribute more to classic than I ever could, why would I be mad?

Best evolution tbh. Ill be ready in august for the true experience then.
---
Dope as video was watching it yesterday
---
Everyone knows fishing is great. Everyone also knows it’s boring af.
---
Well, this tool seems very accurate on normal, if nothing else.
---
Average, depending on class, was 10-12 days played.  I remember taking about 15~ on my warrior, but I wasn't being very efficient.
---
You know i once posted that about LSD...and now i have an LSD dealer! Crazy.
---
Most comments answer your question well enough, but also call Mocking Blow a 'taunt,' but let me just get say right away that it is technically not a taunt.
---
A taunt makes the mob target you AND it puts you on the top of the threatmeter.
---
Mocking Blow (and Challenging Shout) forces the mob to target you for 6 seconds, but it does not put you on the top of the threatmer. If you haven't done enough threat by the time Mocking Blow fades, it will turn to whatever target has more threat. So Mocking Blow is bad for a boss like Golemagg where a tank switch is "required" (can be done without a tank switch), so if taunt resists on Golemagg, just wait for the CD and taunt again. However, Mocking Blow is fine for a boss like Firemaw where you only switch tanks to eat wing buffets (threat lowering ability).

The CM Team told me, invites for all F&amp;F went out soon so dunno. LoL

**Intro:** We are looking for experienced and non-experienced players to join our family styled guild, we are wanting to build our ranks prior to Classic so we can get a head start on helping out our guildies with leveling, dungeons, farming and more. Our goal is to down the raids as they release but it is not mandatory to show up to raid (aka you wont get kicked) we know RL happens. So if your looking for a tight knit group of people looking to down raids, farm gear, lvl professions we are the Guild for you!
---
We hope you enjoy your time here! We'll see you in Classic!
---
  
---
**Server:** Planning on a **PvE** server as we have lives outside WoW and don't want to spend valuable grinding/farming time getting ganked for hours
---
**Raid Times:** Thursday: 9pm-11pm (EST)Friday: 9pm-11pm (EST)
---
**Discord:** [**https://discord.gg/uJjcCeJ**](https://discord.gg/uJjcCeJ)
---
Still seems like a troll to me.
---
That only works for the poster of the video, unfortunately. I did that for Asmongold and I still get ass loads of recommended videos for him.
---
No beta patch notes...
---
yeah beta is over if you are not in 
---
rip my wow token ill be salty about you forever
---
new path of exile league in about 10 days ill just un follow / un sub and not think about classic for a couple months
---
I can’t take it at work...makes my hands shake.
---
yep
---
TIL you'd just buy your morning coffee every other day if the price on the menu was $10 instead of $5. That's absolutely definitely 100% how people spend money.  
---
Economics is so much easier now that I have this knowledge.
---
Not surprisingly seeing as Blizzard completely gutted the golden age of Shaman support gameplay in favor of the watered down neglected cookie cutter class design that is retail Shaman. Vanilla was a great time to play Shaman in an era where playing a support role was an actual thing.
---
Just play Enhancement on retail you will actually laugh out loud about how badly designed it is, it's a complete joke what they've done to Shaman.
---
Your post definitely made me think about it. Another reason is because people in the beta are only at 30 and haven't been able to do real raiding yet, so must of the stuff that's been happening (WSG, dragging teremus to stormwind, etc) have been stuff I've thought about in the context of "yeah, this happened to me, personally, back then" rather than in the context of my old guild doing/achieving things.
---
It could be a combined ress and bres instead of a separate ability. Use it out of combat as a normal revive, use it in combat and invoke the 30 min cd.
---
Patch notes are for live only
---
Phase 2 when DM is released.
---
Hey all good. Im a complete noob, and theres no telling how his day went. Ill just take the L on this one. Thanks though :). See you in classic!
---
Went out soon? I'm not sure how to interpret this.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo9buo9Mtos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo9buo9Mtos)
---
In the very beginning, I remember making Trial Account after Trial account. Leveling to level 10 sooo many times, it’s surprising I never got sick of those first 10 levels xD I did get to know the Orc starting zone pretty well though..
---
Aziriphale (weird spec, sometimes healy troll shaman checking in) I remember playing with you in AV. I mostly did PVE stuff though.
---
Keep in mind that we now know that private servers have aggro range too low, enemies on average are way too easy (wrong abilities, or not enough of them, if they even have them at all, like the flame rocs), and instance runs are substantially easier, making the chance for a wipe and wasted time much lower.
---
Average time at the end of vanilla was around the 12 day mark (10-12 depending on class).
---
Also maybe check out "nerf dirks" by"stuck". It has lower production value than the roguecraft, but if my memory is right it came out earlier.
---
You think the majority of old wow players wanted BFA? There is a huge gap between people who want 3 day AVs and people who like BFA. You're kind of proving my original point. The classic community is not a monolith that uniformly agrees on what was better, and the people who pretend that it is and dismiss people who disagree with them as "retail players" or however you want to define them, are being disingenuous.
---
I’m ready to tank or do damage, whatever is needed, but I’m gonna roll on damage gear as tank and whoever doesn’t want me to can leave the group. I’m not going to pigeon hole myself to become a MT. You can easily tank dungeons without skilling prot
---
Peggle, nothing like a good game of peggle while sitting in bg que.
---
Didnt the head on onyxia give a similar buff?
---
They Just told me, that Slots for Media are Limited but we dont need to worry, if we are on Family &amp; Friends whe get it soon.
---
I disagree. I think people will be pleasantly surprised how fun enhancement is. My brother gave me his 40 shaman with that blue 2h from cathedral. I ended up deleting my main because I loved that shaman so much. Windfury is fun in pvp and nobody can change my mind
---
When was this?
---
Because my friend at Blizz legitimately spoke to them today about it, as he was wondering why the person his F&amp;F list (me) didn't get access.
---
I've spoke to some others in the same spot as me, their friend told them last Thursday they should have been in, and for whatever reason didn't (capacity/etc, but were specifically told Thursday)
---
/r/WindfuryTotemMasterrace
---
There was hope that F&amp;F invites were still trickling out, but apparently not, you're just done-zo per the Classic team if you aren't already in even if you're F&amp;F.
---
No, but i've taken up to 60mg because I actually have a prescription for it. It also can have a host of side effects from taking too much such as not being able to piss like normal (Like water from a kinked garden hose), bad irritability on come down (good mood to pissed off with no in between like a light switch), shakiness, and restlessness. Everyone is different, but it can easily make someone LOSE efficiency. Being tired and pissed off, but can't sleep isn't going to help you level faster versus someone who got restful sleep and has stable emotions.
---
Dude! I feel you man! I’m going to be in the same boat
---
SOUNDS LIT SEE YOU THERE
---
I first started playing about 2 months after launch.    
---
I'm coming back to play Classic because I want to clear Naxx40 and AQ40.  Did most of it, but never a complete clear and always felt salty about that.  It will be fun raiding on a decent computer, instead of my budget college laptop.  7 fps in MC wasn't fun.  
---
I pvp'd but never got terribly far, I think my warrior made it to rank 10?  Whichever lets you get a full set of tier1 pvp gear.  I think it's LT Commander.     
---
All in all, with all the world bosses and if we can get some noob town raiding going on, I think people will have fun in classic.  But you'll miss retail for real.
---
I can almost guarantee they'd be able to do it if they wanted. It's probably as simple as uncapping the debuff limit on all mobs, then creating a flag that re-institutes the limit on certain mobs. Those "certain mobs" are literally all mobs other than the new "classic" content.
---
I suspect they're already doing this kind of thing for classic WoW.
---
We're a long way off from a hypothetical 1.14 patch, though.
---
Honestly Im coming to WoW completely new pretty much (started in legion...) This has me hyped beyond belief since Im more of a fan of the old time MMO's like everquest, runescape classic, tibia, etc. I am super hyped for this cause I get the benefit of experiencing this like a true MMO. All the new mmo's pale in comparison to the journey im about to go on. My only regret is not playing back then!
---
The friends bit is the worst part.
---
Beta is great, I am enjoying it. But none of my friends have it. Meanwhile, I watch streamers and all of theirs are, so beta is just a live level 30 capped server to them. 
---
I’m sitting there unmotivated to play after hitting 30 since all my buds are still playing other games till 8/27. 
---
First world problems, I know.
---
I mean it's the highest top end weapon till hwl/gm weps or bwl, gives it a lot of value if you get it in p1 as a warrior.
---
First week I am booking off so I can play everyday. Probably will put in at least 12 hours a day for 7 days. Then level in my free time the week following after work, hopefully around 6 hours a day. Aiming for 2 to 2-1/2 weeks to 60, a lot of guilds want 5 weeks out raid ready. So you need time to gold farm/BIS slot after hitting 60, oh and attunements lol.
---
Can you PM me? I'm OP.
---
I’m legit doing this except swapping adderall for Ritalin and no soft drink
---
Wait, you mean to tell me an official blizzard build is more accurate than a bunch of neckbeard's memories? Say it ain't so!
---
no.
---
in modern mythic it's dps &gt; everything. and has been since... atleast Cata?
---
well, as far as loot priority is possible given we have forced PL
---
This is a pretty valid writeup.
---
Most prot paladins in vanilla will blow their mana load way to fast.  They think they are warriors and need to try to front-load threat as much as possible, espeically because of their 'no taunt syndrome'.  
---
Waiting for threat is in a huge part related to rage mechanics.  The way rage works, it is similar to other mechanics known as 'Win More / Lose More' mechanics (sometimes called Snowballing), and this is why the start of a fight is so fragile for warriors.
---
Paladins do not suffer this, and their opening threat is just fine.  This causes most paladins to over-spend on threat, thinking they are equally as fragile in the early threat dept.
---
In addition, the sapper charges towards the end are fantastic fun in PvP. A stealth class or a Night elf can set the trap.
---
They could do like Diablo where there are multiple late game sets of armor but slight tweaks each season make some better or worse and people are always improving on builds.
---
Less about stats and more about the synergy of different builds
---
Again, immersion.
---
I'm playing bfa with a boosted character while I wait. Can see it being something I do between classic. It's not amazing but it'll do. Paying for the sub might as well, right?
---
A 40man raid doesn't need more than 10 healers, some just 4 or 5. You'll be competing with druids and priests for those slots.
---
cringe
---
King's honour, friend.
---
First time i tanked anything i was shaking so hard and my heart was hammering so hard i could hardly even control my mouse. Probably learning to tank was more than anything a struggle to overcome the anxiety and pressure. But eventually there was a BRD run that was just so chill and cool, we did the whole dungeon, it took about 4 hours, and the group were so supportive and kind and explained things so well, i can still remember the feeling of just noticing that the nerves were gone and everything just seemed simple and smooth from then on out.
---
Seems like conflicting replies, but either way all we can do is wait 40 more minutes (6pm PST) and see what posts pop up, IF any posts start popping up. Wednesday and Thursday are safe bets for no invites, Friday is possible.   
---
If nothing this week, I'm super confident next week will be the level increase to 40 on Beta which to me seems like a logical time for more waves to happen.
---
&gt;"so what if noobs down the road don't get the full experience, I just want mine"
---
You miss many things in life and even then you miss infinitely more because you were born and live 80years\~ out of the many millions that have and will be for humanity. Missing out is part of being a finite being. Also by changing what has been you change what the full experience were, don't forget that. I started playing at 1.6 and i never felt like i missed out until my father removed internet for me right before AQ40 patch and i missed the opening, now that one hurt at the time but it wasnt so much the opening i missed but rather the new friends i found so much fun playing this new cool experience with that i was now missing out on.  
---
How about making it a 2phase exclusive starting later in classic? Or just change timed exclusive to not be timed but rather permanent like you suggest. Then there's no stress at any time. Considering the monumental task of getting AQ40 mount, i wouldn't say it's far fetched to allow the mount be obtainable forever aswell.  
---
I am also one who wants classic to be forever, like one permanent phase 6 server and one that restarts every 2 years\~.
---
Why dont you just play the one the looks coolest
---
do you need the retail client installed?
---
Just don't join it.
---
So if a tank had 3 stacks on a boss they would still use sunder armour to generate? 
---
Do offtanks use it to keep threat on a boss they’re not tanking as well?
---
Freaking sick dude!
---
Too expensive to make and you play axe spec or sword. Mace only for MoM.
---
I remember people telling me that Shamans couldn't be effective healers, and then `Stormthuman` was like "Fuck it, I'll tank Scholo for you." We cleared in record time, because I had A.) a fuck ton of mana, and B.) a lot of pure MP5 gear (and mana totems)
---
Also Storm was a badass tank, but once he said I was cool, it was all good.
---
What about.. yes! I want something like the sharding technology, but tailored to Classic, so that i don't have to wait in too big of a queue before i can comfortably collect several wolf asses! 
---
It will make my Classic questing experience (the best part of the game) much more convenient and allow me to be as efficient as i can. 
---
I've learned to appreciate it from BFA that i can rush to 60 without having to waste time waiting because other people from my server kill my quest mobs. I'm gonna group up and switch layers to avoid that, ez. Got a layer about to empty up? Hit me up son.
---
Just for the first months or weeks or so until the plebs are out of the way and i've evaded all the ganks in heavy PvP zones like STV and became filthy rich on gathering all the multiverse resources with my organized farming groups. Don't care about those nonames phasing in afterwards anyway lol. Thanks! &lt;3
---
I won’t miss retail at all, personally.. But it’s good they’re letting people play both, with the same monthly sub!
---
&gt; I'll be playing Horde and PvP'ing 95% of the time
---
Go Orc. The stun resist is absolutely broken in PvP.
---
Depends on what class you choose. You might still want LW/Skinning on an alt for resistance gear.
---
Problem with that is if you are close enough for the druid to hit, the hunter is too close to shoot :(
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
Im not a troll. I started in Legion, but have been playing MMO's for years. I liked the idea of transmogs when I started playing, and was just wondering. I can see where it would seem like Im feigning ignorance, but the question was genuine. I don't know what more you want from me, but it was just a question. As someone completely new to the experience Ill do my fair share of searching before I ask a dumb question again. Have a good rest of the day.
---
Both have great pvp racials. I believe the Orc stun resistance is generally considered stronger.
---
&gt; I wonder how this will affect raiding.
---
It will be a joke, also.
---
There is a reason private servers started buffing boss armor and damage by 20 to 50% since 2010, real vanilla is too easy. TBC is the expansion I'm really hyped for anyway.
---
&gt; You think the majority of old wow players wanted BFA?
---
Yes I do. Not only that, but then when they got what they asked for, they realised that they didn't like it and bitched and moaned some more.
---
&gt; The classic community is not a monolith that uniformly agrees on what was better, and the people who pretend that it is and dismiss people who disagree with them as "retail players" or however you want to define them, are being disingenuous.
---
I'm not talking about the classic community.  I'm talking about the majority of people who wanted changes from TBC&gt;Wrath and beyond.  Achievements, group finders, transmogs, all of these features were asked for by the community.
---
Because in classic, the race you choose is a big deal. Racial abilities were unique and potent and mattered greatly to your character. Being able to change willy-nilly is kinda game breaking, especially since not everyone can afford to pay for it on a whim.
---
Open beta will be fat though right?
---
Also pro tip: Name your pet the name of the Druid
---
Yeah, I'm not too sure I buy this "CM told me"
---
His post history doesn't reek of someone whose been actively engaged with a CM about F&amp;F details, while I've been sharing updates.
---
Unfortunately, I'm not sure how it gets more direct than speaking to the Classic team, which my friend at Blizzard did. Classic team decides when they want people in, and I guess even F&amp;F they don't want in now. Literally got that reply an hour ago and it killed my mood lol.
---
I played in an AV for like 10 hours one day. Went to sleep, woke up, got into AV again, it was the same one. I think it lasted like 25 hours total.
---
Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
I literally used the most iconic rogue in Wow history. That is Neilyos first video. Tinfoil is strong here.
---
You are prescribed to it, for people who don’t have add taking this much is like taking meth and you can stay up for days.
---
Only for a while then it’s just no tiredness and teeth grinding.
---
That doesn't make sense. The point is not to not make friends. The point is to be efficient leveling. Half your time spent leveling is running around, and that is cut in half when you are dual boxing to level.
---
Going through some of the content again I will need help remembering the routes and I’m not afraid to ask for help to figure stuff out, but yeah I’m not super assertive. While it can be real good to lead with an iron fist, I also like to think the cooperation is what the game is about. It depends on the group
---
From what you said the A suffix makes sense though :)
---
Druid.
---
[Warlock](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IZ0gVhxyMZqVr00x).
---
Having 1/5 improved shadow bolt should overwrite other warlock's buff with the inferior +4% version. Just to stamp out any hope of this abomination managing to weasel his way into a raid group.
---
Stacking as many borderline useless pet buffs as possible while ignoring the good ones.
---
Investing in improved searing pain because it's probably the worst warlock damaging spell.
---
Yep this spec is trash.
---
Appreciate it. Thanks - I will likely be doing that then. I assume it's the combo of stun resist + blood fury?
---
have you tried dual wielding yet? most say its slower but through my testing that absolutely wasnt the case.  
---
Been doing a bunch of testing myself. i'd devote half a level to dw and the other half to 2h. did so over the course of multiple levels. 32 and 33. 37 and 38. DW was significantly faster each time.  
---
To use made up made up numbers to illustrate how i felt on it, if the stars aligned 2h could kill a mob in 3 seconds, but could take as long as 35 with awful luck. Meanwhile DW ranged from 9-15.  
---
For more anecdotal evidence, i felt like any time i ran into other warrs using 2h and hamstring... i'd be starting my 3rd mob while they were still running back n forth on their first mob.  
---
worth a try at least i'd say.  
---
also, dont forget about the power of spirit. warr's regen rate from spirit is insane in vanilla. you get 80% of spirit + 6. (this was nerfed while everyone else stayed same in tbc). i have next to zero downtime aside from the occasional bandage. There is often gear that will give you spirit almost for free, essentially. For example, an of the bear item might be giving you 8str/8stam but another of same level might offer 7str/7stam/6spirit. try to always grab those when you can.
---
On that we can agree my friend especially because of the monumental task it is to get it.
---
[removed]
---
I agree with you, but holy does not crush undeads on pvp. I mean, not by their own hands. (2)
---
The difference between retail and private servers is that very rarely do people pay for 5-10 accounts in retail, whereas there is nothing stopping you on private.
---
As for the economy, I'll be using it for leveling, not making gold.
---
how are you going to hybrid as rogue in pve, give up AR and BF?
---
*Use R1 Multi-Shot when you expect the fight to last longer
---
Thanks - appreciate the response. Good chance I do that.
---
I don't know what to say... /hug.
---
Stun resist is the only reason orc is better than undead. More classes have stuns than fears and you can get a pvp trinket at 60 which shares the same fear resist and CD as the undead racial.
---
This will only really work if you okay horde. From my experiences most Alliance players just try and avoid PVP combat because they know it’s a waste of time.
---
The horde how ever are just a bunch of PVP chad zerglings that have to kill anything g that moves.
---
why would they queue again if they just left? Did you think about what you wrote here? lol
---
If you're going to just queue again why leave in the first place?
---
&gt;though not nearly to the same extent as Vanilla
---
Which is the issue here, and was caused by a plethora of world-pvp reducing additions, not limited to bgs, arenas, and flying.
---
The lack of actual reasons to wPvP is another issue.  The balance was in favor of organized PvP.  They should have added some wPvP bases or something to balance it.
---
Those aren’t rookie numbers...
---
If you're a rogue that plans on so much PVP, you definitely don't want to be Alliance simply because of the Orc stun resist.
---
WotF is powerful, but I think people give it too much credit. The PVP trinket is good enough and Priests and Warlocks go down easy for rogues. There are far more classes you'll have a rough time with that have stuns you'd love to resist.
---
better not use a streamers name eh? You could have just used a random name that is not related to streamers then this whole thread wouldn't be like this btw..
---
You used the name Asmongold and of course, it would "seem" that you hate Asmongold.
---
Hope they address this since no one is asking for easier raids on the big 1.12 pservers.
---
No, but the beta client also works for the stress tests, they are just different realms.
---
I refuse to believe this. I think Blizzard will continue to invite players so all zones be populated.
---
Average at the end of vanilla was 10-12 days depending on class.  At the end there was little to no competition for mobs and people knew what to do at this stage as well.  
---
You might be reasonably focused and may have only quested with little to no downtime, but that is extremely uncommon.  Most people are going to run dungeons multiple times, browse the AH from time to time, maybe attempt to level professions as they go, etc.  
---
Also, enough of the private server comparison.  Aggro ranges are confirmed to be way too low, resist/armor stats are way off, most enemies don't have the right abilities (flame rocs dont even have a single ability, where as in vanilla they had fireball), you can easily melee kite in between melee swings on pservers, where as in vanilla (and beta currently) this is virtually impossible, and dungeon mob values are now known to be way off (compare beta herod to any pserver...).
---
I don’t see how that’s racist? He’s pointing out that it’s super fucked up that the Congo killed the health worker because they’re fucking stupid. I agree, what intellectual person would kill someone who is legitimately coming to help them? Am I missing something?
---
Yes, SFK is a low to mid 20s instance. The mobs in the beginning are 19 (grey to 26) and the final boss is 26. It is fine to run it at 30 but you should not expect a challenge.
---
I never implied that *you* said any of that. A lot of people do get angry though.
---
Dont believe me I am fine. It is fine to have your own source. I still believe. If you lost your hope fine. I mean he still can let you fet flagged Manually by the Employee Team :-)
---
wait... Making a **duo group with yourself playing both chars** is *NOT* soloing in your eyes?

---
The important moral lesson being that dwarfs should be attackable by either faction, and possibly give heavy leather? :D
---
Fiery enchant on my lvl 6 think warrior was the shiz. Could prof from rend!
---
For Alliance, it’s been some, but not all, level 10+ quests starting in Loch Modan, Westfall and Darkshore. I assume it’s about the same for Horde, but haven’t tested it. I’m slowly making my way through every Alliance quest at the appropriate level.
---
It’s killing me that they didn’t have reforged ready in time for some pre-classic nostalgia. All I wanted was to get more hyped that thought possible, but no.
---
AoE loot is a nice feature imo, especially when farming low level content. (Because looting all mobs at once is faster etc)
---
Orc or gnome.
---
It's an MMO. The point is to play with other people. So play with other people.
---
Oh awesome - I had been wondering about the trinket. That's super helpful to know - I was curious about if it would dr with WotF as well. Thanks :)
---
Fast (leveling asap using guides) should NOT be 9.5 days /played.
---
for some reason this made me wonder if I could find videos of my old guild (i lost all my vanilla screencaps).  
---
I didn't find anything but I did find a timeline for the server, which includes A LOT of names and events I recognize. It's wild that someone documented all this. [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Staghelm/The\_Timeline](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Staghelm/The_Timeline)  
---
If anyone else is feeling nostalgic maybe try looking up your server!
---
&gt;Tryhards will say its questionnable but all casual guilds wont really give a fuck.
---
Casual guilds aren't going to clear AQ.
---
thankfully we all make twice as much now as we did then so it all evens out!
---
It's fun when there is a competition.
---
These guys however set up scout accounts to spy on world boss spawns, and coordinated (via text messages I've heard) to kill bosses before any horde guilds could even group up. This was on a small populated server.
---
The rest of the server got their revenge however, and prevented their scarab guy from getting the black qiraji mount.
---
Skinning. Vendor everything untill medium leather, those you can AH.
---
Asmon unironically hit this on the head perfectly.
---
Paraphrasing:  "If you got into an instance and the tank was bad, you were teaching that tank or you were waiting another 2 hours to find another one, who could also be just as bad".
---
LOL
---
At the end of vanilla, the average time was 10-12 days played.  10 would be hunter and 12 would be warrior.  WR is 124~ hours by a guy who planned and practiced a route.  
---
Yea... no, you aren't hitting 60 in 2 weeks with 7 hours a day.  It is actually impossible.   You'd have to be playing 12 hours a day and know exactly where to go, when to do it, and how to best do everything; at least as a warrior.
---
[deleted]
---
Ok that's awesome. Thanks very much for the info. I think you guys have made up my mind. Appreciate the info.
---
Jebaited
---
Arthas was my favorite
---
Loved fiery while leveling my warrior...
---
If you managed to get in, use a voidwalker and leave Torment on autocast!!
---
Not many remember this meme. For clarification it's from the BWL announcement video where they show Chromaggus in Vael's room for some reason.
---
Hmmm.. I don't remember, and idk if this is a joke.. But the oven character I made was on.. Scarlet Crusade I think? I can't recall
---
&gt; probably a butthurt mage embarrassed that the rogues and warriors wiped the floor with him dps wise.
---
That's supposed to happen tho
---
On bosses, it goes up to 5 sunders if I recall correctly
---
You can play wow on the switch?
---
This has been possible since 2004. People just didn’t think of it. 
---
It’s like asking the general wow population to collectively go back to clicking their spells and keyboard turning. 
---
Since it’s a private channel, all it takes is the wrong person gaining ownership once to start kicking, banning and password protecting the channel. Every server will eventually have their world chat ruined by this. 
---
/1 /g /2 /4 will be the only reliable ways to communicate with the server at large.
---
Drakkova trashes every class in duels of equal gear
---
Idk what your talking about watch his videos
---
I've spent a few hundred hours working on Human start route, so I'll not be participating, but still paying attention.
---
For any gnomes / dorfs interested in trying the [1-10 FedEx route](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_n2be6WJYnGxQUioBGd7JGYY7FtlU0ThwGcO8Mh69M/edit?usp=sharing) (Gnome / Dwarf tab, it's less fleshed out than Human, but should be good) while there's a bunch of people around, more data is great.
---
On Pservers, we timed the Dun Morogh starting zone route at ~3:20 to ten, and with only like 30 kills through the whole route, it shines the more people there are on the server. One or two people testing it would def help streamline it for launch.
---
For everyone else, have fun trying to tag mobs, we'll see ya at ten.
---
If the worldchat totally replaces trade and general, it will be hard to abandon it entierly. Of course, you could join it just in the major cities - but that can be said about all QoL changes they made over the years. You COULD just ignore LFD in wrath, but it wouldn't be exactly the same as in classic.
---
You can get the PVP trinket at any level after 10.
---
The way I saw it was that all the orc heroes (minus the blademaster) were all Shaman, albeit different specs of Shaman.
---
Far seer was Elemental.
---
Shadow Hunter was Resto.
---
And Tauren Chieftain was Enhancement.
---
But I think I did that for it to make sense in my head.
---
That poor Nes
---
What a shame, gonna be able to 4 dps, 1 heal dungeons
---
There aren't enough drops to pass on an eye if one drops in p1/p2 and hope you get a BRE/SR next week. Having a sulfuras is a massive ugrade over anything other than those 2 weapons for ranking.
---
Not exactly what I meant...
---
Mounts and pets not taking up bags... Or achievements. How sweet would a would first AQ40 achievement be?
---
What, no he doesnt (at least in thr 1-20 guides)
---
I don't feel like I've wasted my time when I'm playing a game I enjoy with friends and guildees.
---
Unless the comment is about artificial timesinks in the game as time gates, and if so, that's not what I'm arguing.
---
Snek is best elemen
---
&gt;and of course, it would "seem" that you hate Asmongold.
---
I could have used "truffel" and it would "seem" that I hate truffels, to someone who, for some reason, feels insecure if someone around him doesn't worship truffels the same way he does.
---
The important thing to take away from this is: I don't care what you, or anyone else thinks I hate, like, love, cuddle or despise. I also don't care if you feel "offended" by the examples I chose to use.
---
And you most certainly don't get a say in what I use as an example or not.
---
To be fair, we are also taking Blizzard's word at face value.  There is no guarantee that everything they claim they have isn't either an outright lie, or messed up by a coding error along the way.
---
Because of the Stress Test? Yeah prob. But at least we can talk to Alpha Players again^^
---
I know, it seems super odd and I think it would help it sell a lot better
---
Man, I wish I still had the picture I made back in the day. I named it something like "How many soul shards should I bring to the raid?".
---
[It looked like this](http://i.imgur.com/Q9iInUl.jpg), but with 4 soul shard bags.
---
I did not get into hardcore raiding until mid TBC, but I did MC/BWL casually while it was current.
---
We know that the Vanilla experience is not for everyone.  Some people will be excited about returning to the start of their amazing journey, experience part it, and stop, because they realize that they've already experienced Vanilla, and despite the fond memories, is not as fun the second time around, or there will be those that have other priorities as we are now 15 years older compared to when we first started.
---
There will be those that were too young when WoW came out, and are the type who want to get into a game, play 30 mins, and quit for the day, not realizing major part of the Vanilla experience was interacting with your community, getting to know people and having people getting to know you (and being on good behavior because of this).   And those that joined later on in WoW, and not realize how much more of a grind Vanilla was for.. well basically everything.
---
Please do not get me wrong.. I am super excited about WoW Classic.  I am sure I will be spending at least 40 hours a week playing this game when its out, but we have to realize that everyone here at the moment may not be everyone that will remain when its said and done.  All the vocal people having a blast in beta, there are ones that have silently quit, now knowing the game may not be for them despite other people having fun.  
---
I've tried getting all the close friends who I played vanilla with to join me when Classic is out.   I think only about 7 out of the 20 or so plan to come back, and out of those 7, only me and 2 others are excited about it.  The rest just interested in seeing how things go.  
---
Of the ones not planning to come back, some did try the beta, and just was not feeling it.
---
Main thing is, until things settle down, and there are hard numbers, everything right now is hype.  Anthem was hyped, Division 2 was hyped, and they both had the numbers and the interest up to, and at launch.  Now Division 2 is bleeding players, and Anthem is belly up.
---
Quests that require X of item to drop having their own chance to drop per player in a group. This is the most anti-group mechanic that exists in Vanilla due to the vast amount of collect X items quests and how woefully sub-optimal it is to do them even as a 2-man group.
---
Played since EU-release, stormstrike has always been there. Even before the shaman "revamp"
---
I started jerk off at 7 years old wtf Lol
---
It looks pretty great I'd be interested in seeing a video in the future.
---
raid meta probly gonna end up 40 dps in classic
---
You can avoid 100% of avoidable deaths by killing the opposite faction before they kill you.
---
People tend to view everything with what is best in Naxx and whilst Hunters initially are pretty good in PvE they taper off towards the end. That being said high end PvE is much less of an overall focus in Classic compared with retail and Hunter is still a great class, especially in PvP/World PvP. Good Hunters that are able to utilize their full toolkit are disgusting in PvP and tear clothies to shreds. 
---
As usual though there will be plenty of Hunters and plenty of bad ones too. I think in regards to Classic the other classes kind of get overshadowed by the golden age of the Warrior as well as the golden age of support classes like Paladin/Shaman that had unique gameplay that was removed from the game. Mages are insane in Classic and yet you don't hear much about them either so I wouldn't worry about whether a class is loved or not.
---
I've heard about that too, question is; why haven't you had your "in" flag you manually with the employee team?
---
Edit: Reason I say this is because it just seems super unlikely to be realistic.
---
This. Take your upvote.
---
Only if you're a public personality. The only people who have been getting access since Friday are streamer connections where Blizz does grant access. They aren't giving it to randos, and they wouldnt just believe you're on the F&amp;F list, as customer service/CM's aren't really involved in that. The F&amp;F list is simply an email Blizz employees send their F&amp;F info to.
---
If you want to make gold, avoid the crafting professions. The only exception to this is keeping Enchanting at level 1 to DE greens, but you can have an alt do that.
---
dont care what streamers do , just stop posting it here without context.. it is eithe blind fanboyism or advertisement
---
Earthern Ring here as well. I was alliance side in Tempora Heroica. I also remember KOTK and Eleventh Hour on Alliance side. Shadow Remains on horde side. I was in quite a few epic AVs but was still surprised to see my female night elf warrior (Avelen) on that list. Guess the Ashkandi helped. Hopefully i get one when classic comes out as well. Miss that sword!!!
---
Someone in scholo told me to sunder. 
---
I then knew how to tank.
---
shield is horribly mana inefficient. and if used on the warrior tank, slow down rage generation. In pvp? maybe. in Pve? it's a mistake 99% of the time.
---
renew is also inefficient and just too slow. if we're talking early classic, renew don't stack.
---
holy nova: you need to heal what, 10 targets to be even close to mana efficient with it?  so much of that mana cost goes into the ''generate no threat'' part of the spell, which there's no pratical application to for such a small heal.
---
lesser heal stop at... 22? 24?
---
prayer of healing: very few classic boss have AoE damage, but yes i'll concede it for Vael and the few like him.
---
heal/greater heal... that's the thing you should be spamming , a downranked version of it. with 5-6 priest spamming it the tank will be topped inbetween hit. same style as pally.
---
flash : agree. you keep the max rank or second-to-last rank if you need spot healing.
---
So, heal/greater heal make up 90% of your heals, flash heal for spot healing, prayer of healing on the few fight it's applicable.
---
If you used anythingelse remotely often... that would explain why so many people claim they constantly had mana issues during classic.
---
Ptsd for my gap filler offspec prot pally

Save it as a Shortcut :D
---
you ask a friend with a script lol. or you ask your dealer if he has some or knows someone who does. honestly shouldnt need a dealer though so many people have prescriptions im sure you could find someone
---
Skipping your therapy session to play games despite the negative effects would just justify your disability checks tho right?
---
Sounds like Alliance scum to me
---
Been saying for years, diablo2 is a slot machine. People actually WANTED that in D3. Now they copied that to WoW.
---
Thank you for broadcasting that there is an update!
---
Is this CM your friend, or was this just a public tweet @ them?
---
All QoL changes can be described that way though. LFD has been in the game longer than worldchat, and that is seen as a blessing to be gone. Why is it worse to go back to the original state of communication, and just ban worldwide chats?  
---
I can see this to happen myself. If /world remains a private channel, it will get ruined pretty quickly. Why has it then survived for so long on beta?
---
kiddie mode lmao, true af, retail and its "TIME TO PRESS THIS KEY" kind of shit
---
I know its popular and made fun of to take adderall to stay awake, but people need to know it affects people differently and there can be side effects you don't expect, nor want over any perceived benefit. Which is why it requires a prescription.
---
yeah but have you tried it ever its a lot of fun to grind on addy and listen to electric music. not saying i or we need it for wow but it is definitely dangerously pleasurable
---
1. I don't believe any races starting zones are race-locked. You should be fine.
---
2. Seal of Command procs 7 times per minute.
---
3. Certain crafting professions (Like Blacksmithing) can make certain BIS gear. And stuff like Ironfoe will compete with most raid weapons of a similar caliber.
---
4. I have nooooo clue about the Holy resistance. From my own experience it can still miss I'm fairly sure.
---
Hope that helped!
---
putting fiery enchant on a tradeable item and just leveling alts with it was great.
---
Yea, I actually meant more so that even if the ZG mount drops you’re still splitting it between a lot more than just 4 other people. 
---
But, this dude likes the undead mounts so more power to him. Get what you like, not what other people want.
---
Well. I can Just Forward What they told me. And I am on a F&amp;F list that you nor hit that easy, so I can't Just Message the Guy Like you maybe can. It is not a simple Employee.
---
It's incorrect behaviour in a game supposed to be a remake from WoW Vanilla, you gotta deal with it my man
---
A simple E-Mail to the EU Team.
---
If we really have to live with layering as a reality, then they need to make sure that we never get phased out. 
---
There is NO need to forcibly remove us from the layer we are in against our will; if a que is needed, then so be it.
---
yes , either fanatical followers or hidden paid advertiser who kept filling this excellent subreddit.. many people use this subreddit to ask questions and discuss classic wow , if they want to watch streams they are able to do so without getting constant bombardment of streamer video here..
---
discussing opa video (from any source) is fine but posting streamer video with no context or discussion with only click bait title is just worst than low effort meme
---
I too recognize Teabow....oh wait.
---
Does he just go house to house asking or is there a website I can refer him to
---
If you read the whole conversation you would see that no one is gonna just drop the bg and come back hours later hoping its still going long enough to sit in another queue and get in for the end game reward. 
---
Everyone leading up to my comment was trying to defend the notion that if you didn't have potentially 20 hours to play 1 single BG then it was reasonable that they shouldn't get something for their time.
---
Is this copypasta
---
Don't think so. It's just a Stress Test.
---
Fiery is a great leveling enchant. Problem is it's pretty much relegated to alts and twinks as the mats and recipe come a bit too late for your first toon if you start at launch. Obviously it falls off hard at endgame with so much fire resistant enemies.
---
Lets talk about this actually since i've put in a fair bit of thought on the subject.
---
Players will have exactly one week(168 hours) from global launch to the first raid lockout reset. A hardcore player can level a character from 1-58 in 120 hours.(48 remaining) At this point, they mix up gearing for Pre-Bis, assisting guildmates, and sending a mage aoe group to farm Hydraxian Rep for 12-14 Hours.(34 Remaining) 4-5 hours of sleep for six days makes 24-30 hours.(4 Remaining) Then there's the time it takes to kill Ragnaros which should be around 3-4 hours for a first clear in a lot of quest gear with some players still not quite 60. (0 Remaining)
---
With this knowledge most hardcore guilds will probably not try for this, but there are 3-4 Private Server No-Life Progression guilds that I know will go for it because they will aim to cut down on these hours. For instance, the fastest classes like mages, hunters, and warlocks, will grind to 60 inbetween 4 and 5 days, and farm up their hydraxian rep. The classes that lag behind will be boosted in group AOE farm in places like Hearthglen which is effective even without dynamic respawn. The 12-14 hours for gearing up Pre-Bis is unneccessary for 90% of the raid. Most of this time just needs to be dedicated to making sure enough healers and specifically the tanks are 60 and as geared as possible. I could see the absolute top 3-4 private server guilds aiming to cut this time to 4-6 hours, which would leave them plenty of time to complete MC even with everyone sleeping 5 hours per night. (Though some will sleep 4 or less on the first few days to get securely ahead of the pack.)
---
Just my thoughts, but if you're looking for whats possible. I would say killing Ragnaros week 1 is absolutely going to happen. Onyxia, for those who don't know, is done in about 15-20 minutes, so of course it will go down as well. Probably before-hand so that they can use the Ony world buff for MC.
---
TL;DR Make sure you're standing in Orgrimmar / Stormwind on Day 7 Hour 16-20 so you can get the Ony buff for leveling, then log off and watch some try hards kill Ragnaros before the reset.
---
P.S. Retail guilds will absolutely not be able to achieve this mark. 5+ years of skill and knowledge on high pop fresh private servers are the only reason it's remotely possible for one of these full guilds to be ready in time.
---
Malkkev, 60 Firelock checking in. In a few guilds but very fond memories of Bloodlust! :D
---
&gt;as it makes me stupidly happy to run around digging stuff up.
---
Well if that's the case, why not come full circle and pick 2 gathering professions?
---
Herbalism and Mining will both give you access to valuable materials which you can auction for a good price at all stages of classic.
---
I wasn't aware steam existed back then
---
amen to that , streamrs have their own platform , ppl who love them can go there with one easy click , no need to pollute this subreddit with streamer’s video and click bait titles..
---
Z
---
There is no guarantee that we wont be getting phased out on release or beyond.  The way it is working now may be unintended, but that doesn't mean phasing against our will wont be happening, and that is the crux of most peoples' concern.

You can't corpse run, you'll be teleported back to the graveyard nearest your death. If you run normally to a starting zone that doesn't have your class as an option, you won't have a class quest or a trainer.
---
World bosses are Phase 2 (with Dire Maul)
---
Holy spells can be resisted by the base spell resist every player and NPC has, but there's no way to gain Holy resistance.
---
I dropped out at the start of Wrath due to the class changes.  The changes to many specs was so drastic that they weren't the class/spec that you fell in love with.  Starting from the pre-patch the balance was completely f'd with people doing insane damage while saying "it's meant to be balanced at 80, it's fine" and then things remained completely ****ed the whole way through.
---
I say even as a person who played mage and took advantage of the 3.0 pre-wrath patch 1/2 shotting people with arcane spec.  It was a clown fiesta with arena players even joking about people having to pop pain suppression in the first 10 seconds or wizard cleaves always threatening to global people.
---
Video is clearly not made with good enough evidence, there's zero method in there sadly, it's concerning but this needs better investigating...
---
Meanwhile if you run into a warrior with that hammer and at least one healer behind him... Get ready for the pain train.
---
indeed its addictive and hurtful. although being able to grind for 40hrs is tempting but a rather unhealthy idea
---
Are you me?
---
Everything was available in the previous stress test just the level was capped. Since we can get to the level to queue for WSG I feel like we should be able to unless we use a different build from Beta.
---
I recommend a low fiber ketogenic diet for the classic poopsocker.
---
Nutrient dense food means less time lost eating, and fewer bathroom breaks.  No carbs means no sugar crash.
---
And of course, if you are intent on actually poop socking it, the one or two rock hard turds you pass on your way to a week 1 rag kill won't even require wiping.
---
All specs being viable while still holding on to what makes classes interesting in vanilla
---
Feel free to link Blizzard confirming this, because I see so many people claiming them saying it, but no one providing PROOF of them saying so.
---
Until I can actually see this post, I remain skeptical.
---
I'm on the beta right now and this is the furthest from the truth, I always make sure I have bandages and food on me, it's always nice when I have a second person doing the same quest it makes it easier.
---
I have found though if you are lucky with gear drops you are set, a great weapon will carry you a long ways and make things easy.
---
Not so sure about that. I do not have an active sub - expired in Jan - but I was invited to, and played the Stress test.
---
Mobs only gave shards if they would give xp.
---
asmongold and his fanboys have filled youtube with constant spam videos , which is disgusting ..
---
&gt;  is there really a huge downside to just have it?
---
Yes. Part of the big appeal of the Vanilla era is having to make choices, and having those choices matter.
---
If the game just gave you 150 talent points and you could get everything, that decision-making would be lost.
---
If the game made talent changes instant and free, that decision-making would be lost.
---
If the game gave you dual-spec, that decision-making would not be entirely lost, but it would be significantly impaired.
---
and ferals!
---
Thanks. I suppose that means that seal damage is gated by both weapon miss chance *and* resist chance, I'll have to remember to factor that in.
---
Just act like summer is over...bam 90 days!
---
Dude fuck off with these Asmongold clips, now it's just getting annoying. Mods, please ban this shit
---
Wait, so I was able to download the client. But there's no server available currently. Am I eligible for this?
---
The extra points in grim reach is actually useful for a couple of things. One is initiation and the other is fear, more specifically you are constantly spamming fear to keep of off of you because you are still squishy at the end of the day however fear is a crap shot meaning that at times it can send a player more than 30 yards out. 
---
A couple of other notes to mention is this build is complicated and you are wanting to improve current skills as much as possible without adding additional spells/rotations. The other is time which goes back to dps, especially when going against multiple foes. Basically what will happen is by the time you get your dots on all the foes the they will wear off and you are dotting them all again in a constant rotation; this is a very important consideration for this build as you are seen as squishy and the foe will think "meh one dot whatever, another dot ok, yet another dot oh shit my health is nearing 0". This build is really a stamina build for not only you but the foe as well.
---
Again this build isn't perfect as there are ways to counter such as debuffs.
---
I have nothing against CoE it just doesn't fit this build. I played with CoE with an iteration of this build but it hurt me more than it saved me. It's a great defensive play but not good for offense. I would look at using this for a destruction build as it's great for that as it keeps them off of you while you can do a lot of single damage hits.
---
I would agree if, and only if, it doesn't bring with it that feature that allowed people to steal guilds if the leader was offline for too many weeks.
---
Is that the super Deluxe Classic WoW package?
---
Err, let's see - a rogue would absolutely lock an enh down. A warrior is basically a more damage Enh shaman. Feral wouldnt be anything special because feral sucks too, but I'd honestly bet that the feral would win most of the time, and they can kite the shit out of them. Just because they are melee doesn't mean they can't cast spells, this isn't retail. Ret sucks.
---
Yup, easiest way to make money / level and it will never NOT be in demand by both factions. Got me my epic mount
---
Disagree. Assuming little to no tolerance, you can take an XR every 8 hours for days and still not feel tired. Your body will ache, your thoughts will be erratic, your decision-making skills will suffer IMMENSELY, and anxiety/paranoia may set in, but I can assure you that you'll still feel 'awake' in the sense that you won't desire sleep.
---
That's just my personal experience, physiology varies person-to-person so maybe you have that advantage of being tired, but I can assure you many people don't. And yes, it is an advantage since staying up for that long ruins your next week by being in a complete unproductive haze.
---
dual spec If you want to pve and pvp its going to hurt really bad
---
1. None of the quests are "race-locked". It was common for e.g. Night Elves to run to the Human starting zone
---
2. u/Horrorifying answered that
---
3. u/Horrorifying answered that
---
4. Simple: If you open the character pane, you will see that there is no indicator for Holy-Resistance, because this stat, as a matter of fact, does not exist.
---
I mean it makes sense. It’s impossible to simulate how bad at the game everyone was then (it was new). People remember it being really hard but now that they’ve experienced it for years they’re much better at the game now.
---
How often do you think you'll be at a similar level and online at a similar time as a particular friend of yours? Most people wouldn't find that sustainable, but I guess spouses are a thing for many people doing Classic
---
Unlikely. You can gather and farm much faster as a mounted level 60 than as a levelling noob.
---
If you're male you should definitely go with a female character, that way you can have fun social interactions like this:  [The Grind - Ep. 1, Part 1 (HD)](https://youtu.be/3od9aUtrcz4?t=391)
---
"hey why does your sword glowing red"
---
i recommend either skinning/mining or skinning/herbalist
---
Putting it on the back burner until 60.
---
But every single mat I find is going to the bank alt
---
They were just mad I said alliance &gt; horde
---
Which is true and they will find out soon
---
Fishing/cooking, skining/herbing all classes must level first aid (I mean I didn't on my shaman back in the day but in raids its nice even for healers)
---
Some of those QoL improvements were trying to solve some big issues while some other design choices were the devs just giving up
---
First is trying to solve the issue of "Feeder Guilds". In both Vanilla &amp; TBC guilds behind the top guilds on the server generally ended up feeding the top guilds their replacement players. To solve this Blizzard started introducing "catch up" mechanics and removed attunements.
---
This made it much easier for top guilds to bring in replacement characters and even allow people to switch classes and helped solve some of the "feeder guild" issues. On the otherhand this really took out the feeling of progression and accomplishment. This slowly caused a shift in outlook as people slowly shifted their motivation from progression to "experiencing" which was nailed in with raid finder.
---
The second issue is trying to come up with a huge number of talents across all the specs and coming up interesting set bonuses for all the specs every tier while maintaining balance. IMO blizzard basically just gave up and used the excuse of "you don't really have a choice anyway, you just pick talents based on what you are doing" and suddenly your biggest feeling of personal progression was down to "pick a few flavors".
---
Then there was the homogenization of buffs, debuffs and abilities so that smaller raid groups(10 mans) could have access to everything without having a very specific comp.
---
Sharding to help with zones feeling alive had the consequence of ruining the sense of community. Same with dungeon finder which helped alleviate the time and pain it takes to assemble a group(which could take longer than the dungeon itself at times...)
---
Basically a combination of QoL choices and balancing choices have added up to the current state.
---
Legion could have been a great turning point. The weapon artifact system (and to a lesser extent legendaries) were really enjoyable personal progression systems that have been missing since they gutted talents. Unfortunately they decided to throw it all away but tbf they failed to design it with future expansions in mind. A big missed opportunity and combined with the fact that it's a huge act to follow bfa stood little chance and the horrible azerite armor system dropped it like a rock.
---
The chair is what connected me to this post. I didnt have a computer but my friends dad played wow and he lived 1 street over and he had this exact same recliner. I had my own account and would play a lot at their house till he got home and kicked me off. Good times.
---
Uldum, Hyjal, grim batol, and all the other unfinished areas, scaled and itemized for classic. (Is that cheating?)
---
The only people complaining are people who didnt actually play vanilla. I dont agree with your "walk in the park" line though.
---
&gt; pages and pages of ~~information~~ Shredder Operating Manual
---
Nope, all coming from my very own disillusioned, misanthropic and bored mind.
---
I mean, they tried (see Hellfire/Zangarmarsh/Terokkar objectives), but they were pretty much dead on arrival. I only recall occasionally seeing wPVP at those. The big hot spots pre-IQD were hubs like Netherwing/Skyguard/Ogri'la and Elemental Plateau. The main thing is, as you said, there needed to be reasons to wPVP, and those just got stripped away over time.

Auto attack on ‘1’.

Legend.

It can while you are running to the restroom and don't have the FP to your next destination.
---
There will always be downtime of some kind
---
Keto gives some like me diarrhea. Especially if you lower the fiber.
---
Yes I am comparing experts to other experts. I study physics btw, I know how it works. 
---
You don't want to use vanish to break nova's you can but if you can use something else to not do it, then you most certainly do that instead. That's why rogues use imp sprint spec, spiderbelt and other shit to get out of roots without blowing vanish.
---
This is among the reasons that many of us were opposed to the Armory when it was originally added. The only dynamics it enables are detrimental ones.
---
I'd still smash lol
---
Minor Beastslayer, that's why.
---
I'm tempted to say pretty much always, but that's not right. At low levels stats take priority, but the higher you get the more effect armor has. 
---
Like most decisions, it's very situational. In you're situation you're kinda talking about maybe some level 12-15 greens. So let's say you're level 15, and what you've got on your hands is a choice between (500hp and 30% damage reduction) or (530hp and 29% damage reduction)
---
It's up to you to make the judgement call. Mobs at your level are gonna be hitting you for something between 10-30 damage, let's just say 15 to make it easy. Now that extra stam is gonna let you take 2 more hits. What will that extra % of reduction get you, at these low numbers is it even enough to drop the 15 dmg hit down to 14? I don't think so, but if it does it's the better option because 500÷14=35.7hits and 530÷15=35.3hits
---
So in your situation, go with the leather item and get the stam. But it really depends on the stat and how much you get. Stam is not that important for a low level warrior, it only beats int. Str agi and spirit is all better for a warrior pre-30.
---
Basically what I'm saying is to not get it in your head that warriors Must wear mail. Do you want to wear all cloth? Fuck no. Will 2 pieces of leather break your character? Also no. Just learn what all the stats do for your character and crunch the numbers, then you can make decisions confidently.
---
And ofcourse your role effects this decision, if you're DPS then you shouldn't be taking any hits at all, so armor is irrelevant. But don't worry about roles till you're 60, before that "leveler" is your primary role.
---
Its little details like this that turned WoW into the braindead piece of garbage it is now.
---
Agree, I think if in the game there are no casting bars blizz should do something (If posible I have no idea if it is) to prevent addons showing them
---
I was just going to grab the hammer solo at 23 after getting the talents for Seal of Command and run speed, there are guides for how to do it.
---
agreed , let them go to another subreddit for streamers and low effort meme
---
i rember using crusader
---
Please keep doing that. It does help
---
His teeth and mouth just look way too weird for me to take him seriously
---
Rodents of unusual size in the sewers of Altdorf?  I don't believe they exist.
---
he shouldnt bother with online he should ask friends/coworkers
---
you think mages do? maybe when they can aoe stuff down but when they have to do single target stuff and drink all the time you think they beat hunters?
---
Even weirder flex but okay
---
You are completely delusional.  Warrior leveling on pservers is brokenly simply because you can /sit proc talents that heal you and increase damage.  
---
The /sit abuse not being possible in classic makes it far more difficult alone.   Also not every pserver has spirit set to some god tier level of scaling, but they all have /sit crit abuse.
---
Yeah, it's a simple quality of life improvement, but that's a slippery slope to go down. I think a reasonable analogy is adding salt to your food - it's better that they are being stringent to begin with, and we can taste test along the way.
---
Yeah they’re pretty alright, their shoulders are usually a bit oversized for me though
---
I think it was in Blackfathom Depths where somebody in my group told me to just spam Sunder Armor (I had understood the idea of defensive stance &amp; shield, but not of threat). been doing the same ever since :D
---
it does not in Classic. this has been tested.
---
in fact, you can safely ignore most of the warlock levelling guides and advice, as those are all based on private servers.
---
The warriors will all pop the first recklessness on Magmadar. 1-2 warriors will die while the boss is enraged for sure.(It's survivable with spam heals) But this will not cause a wipe. The boss will die in 35-45sec for a first clear.
---
I use them all in dungeons. When i get to a 5 stack of anything I'll save it for dungeons usually
---
&gt;Having 1/5 improved shadow bolt should overwrite other warlock's buff with the inferior +4% version. Just to stamp out any hope of this abomination managing to weasel his way into a raid group.
---
I was okay with everything until this... this.. is truly evil.
---
LSD is the best way to go. Just make sure you test it :)
---
You’re stupid.
---
Side-note: I've never seen this amount of clicking. It's usually some spells that are being clicked while at least 1-3 are used properly, but not this guy, nope. And the keyboard turning, oh lawd the keyboard turning.
---
I have been playing Warcraft 1 and 2 in 3 from hive work shop it's fun.
---
Same thing for me I am not interested in any games these days, everything feels like a chore.
---
There is no fun at all.
---
now they are being invited by blizzard  , so it is obvious their opinion change when they got $$$ from official bliz invite..
---
i find the streamer content so fake full of nonsense hype , like one streamer kept repeating now Wow classic is best because he made friends with lots of ppl and he met a lot of other streamers.. like he didnt notice it was a BETA and that fellow streamers also paid by blizz for the event
---
oh geezus I forgot about this, back doing huge AV premades and your turn as the scout pops up...
---
Will have to be after phase 2 comes out at least for the boss summons
---
Simple. Only give yourself an hour of playtime for every hour you work out or do adult/chore stuff. Give your wife/girlfriend the authenticator App so you can't login unless they say.

[[0/21/30] Searing Pain Warlock](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IZcbV0xxoZqV0x0xux)
---
The idea here, is to give your main tank a medium sized heart-attack, when you spam crit-stacked, imp-sacrifice + emberstorm improved [Rank 6 Searing Pain](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=17923) ... which causes bonus threat 8-)
---
as a caster i would just put whatever glowed that was cheapest on my weapons &gt;&lt; mostly because i liked the look and didn't wanna spend a lot while leveling.
---
Honestly it’s a little scary. All the jokes about people’s lives being over and such to nice the game releases...
---
Doesn’t paint a very good look. Especially since it is so true.
---
You won't be able to corpse run there, you'll get resurrected back at the GY you spawned as a ghost at
---
is this how you understand the world of advertismen ? your obvious fanboyism toward asmongold is clouding your sense
---
take me back
---
Good luck getting anything adjusted when 8 million retards that also want difficult content are going to be screaming 'NO CHANGES' over you :(.
---
Now that's how you shut people's mouths, I like your style! I thought the level of the rogue would have more impact on his armor but that makes sense. I knew the work was done poorly on the recent videos, I'm glad someone made the research :)
---
&gt; Well, early on in Elwynn you get a 5 use item that lets you reduce the armor of your target by 50%. That's quite a lot of armor shredded off of a target, so USE IT! (Wisely of course. Pick and choose when you will use these 5 charges, but don't just let them sit there and never get used!)
---
&gt; 
---
RemindMe! 90 days
---
Crafting professions will not make any money early on.
---
1. Early crafting is easy to get into, so tons of people will do it. It is not until later levels that it becomes time-consuming and valuable
---
2. Everyone is saving for mount, hardly anyone is willing to spend money on crafted items.
---
3. Early crafters are eager to get skill-ups and so will craft items at a loss (or just vendoring because of high competition)
---
4. Players will be looking to trade materials for crafts, and the crafters will accept because they want skill ups (every starter zone will have a dozen people taking linen in trade for bags)
---
Crafting is a money sink until late game, and even then only profitable if you put the time in to get the rare recipes (rep grinds, raid drops etc)
---
The only thing that will sell well early on is Wands, but the competition will be high and the margin will be low. It won't be worth selling wands after you are level 20 or so since the margin is so low on the level 5 &amp; 13 wands. The Mystic wands won't sell well because there are TONS of wand options from quests and dungeons that are better.
---
Yeah I'm still deciding to go ham, it will probably take around 360 hours for me to level to 60 so... its a grind for sure, and don't wanna burn myself out in a week.  I'm sure there is loads of gold to be had if you level much faster than others though so there is that.
---
asmongold fanboys brigading and bullying ? thats no surprise
---
Gotta get them jumper cables, a must for every character,

Unless you are in an elite guild it will be difficult once you get past MC. BWL is a step up in difficulty but with 1.12 talents shouldn't be to hard even for average guilds. Early AQ is also easily doable. Everything changes with Twin Emps and beyond. That is when raiding actually becomes a huge timesink and people need to invest time outside of raiding. This is when average guilds will struggle and many break up just like retail vanilla. 
---
And Naxx will be a graveyard for guilds, the goal is to get into one of the elite guilds early, work on BiS gear and Classic experience will be much better.

Low level quest tracker on the minimap. Low impact and for completion!

Hi, /u/UbiGeofram
---
It depends if you're rushing to 60 or not. If you take two more game days to hit 60 you won't have any problem getting mount training
---
This is good news imo, it means non-optimally specced classes will be able to participate and down raids. Which means, more people get to play the way they want and participate in more of the content. The hyper-tryhards will do their thing, but that level of play was always for a fraction of a fraction of players. I think for the majority, it will keep the leveling experience moving along and will overall improve the longevity of the game - far more people will get to look forward to actually participating in endgame.
---
But when you are leveling the mats that you need are typically in the same zone as you so unless you r speed leveling you will naturally stumble across what you need
---
It is now.

I would prefer they fix actual bugs than QoL changes that should have been in the game from the start. They could still have it be classic and not worry about this kind of stuff.
---
Ah, Limewire.   Like having unprotected sex with the internet.  What a glorious time that was.

Ooh, the trainer thing might be a problem. I was planning to run a hunter to Elwynn Forest. I assume I could just swing by Stormwind, though.
---
Where my ESTJ’s at
---
Is that a special forces Firefox window?
---
&gt; I don't believe any races starting zones are race-locked.
---
All of them have a race only starter quest that is a breadcrumb that takes you to your trainer or something like that.  It doesn't lock you out of any other quests really, but there is one.
---
to be fair: remember how you looked in vanilla? Yeah. not as good as a pirate.
---

---
Hi Alliance
---
dont try and wiggle out of this, I explained that a whiteboard of activities (content) to fill up the needed time to monetize is not "leading" now get out
---
&gt; And stuff like Ironfoe will compete with most raid weapons of a similar caliber.
---
That wasn't true in Vanilla per my recollection, and the pserver proc rates for Ironfoe are completely Whose Line-levels of made up. Perhaps said recollection was incorrect, but one should definitely not base Classic Ironfoe value off of pserver Ironfoe value.
---
I didn't mean that I would run as a ghost, I meant that I would die a lot while running there. :|
---
The only get rich quick scheme is getting a highly diserable crafting pattern like Lionheart Helm. Otherwise take a proffession that compliments your class, or you can generate money in a way you will enjoy.
---
All that work just to lose the BG lol
---
Yeah I was on Frostmane-US with Omertà. We PVPd a lot with Grove street. I was friends with Madstabber and Rollinstone. We had some good times back then. Never really played much with Unbreakable I don’t think. I remember seeing him hanging around in Org on occasion that’s about it.
---
Oh man, Four Feathers is a name you don't hear brought up often. Raided with them, Shadow Remains and eventually Dissonance when I rerolled as a prot paladin once Burning crusade launched.
---
&gt;da bell of da bawl
---
Dont drop the soap, dont drop the soap!
---
I hear ya there brother.
---
I’m not so sure about it being a bug. Here's why:
---
Say you have 2 Layers. Layer 1 is full, Layer 2 is losing players (for example during the night) until only 5 players remain online in it. It’s about to be empty.
---
At this point, Layer 1 would either have to phase over these last 5 players to it’s world, flexibly increasing it’s size to accommodate them, so they don’t end up in an empty place.
---
Or, those 5 players would remain on Layer 2, staying in an awfully lonely world. (but could also cash in on it because they could help players from Layer 1, by porting them to their layer so quests are easier, gathering resources are ripe for picking, etc. Oh the possibilities!)
---
Meaning, with the way they currently work (flexibly), people will have to be phased in and out if they play during a time where the population is declining, such as evening time.
---
Or, if on the other hand, the population is increasing past a set threshold, making the layers adjust dynamically, as they are set out to do, creating a phased moment for players.
---
So you didn't read what I wrote - got it.
---
Streamer posts should be removed, unless it is a stream from Blizzard itself. I am tired these streamers.
---
what? The possibility of world chat has existed since 11/23/04. Its a native feature of the game. The only evolution is players just know to join or if the first player, start world chat.
---
LFD was implemented by blizzard with intent. 
---
they are two totally different types of systems.
---
Banning /world bans /\[insertguildnamehere\]\[insertclasshere\]s channels too. Which isnt blizzlike as guild class or at least tank/healer/interrupt channels were their own sub communities within guilds in classic.
---
The issue with this, unless they change it and they havent yet, you can only have one of the "find materials" up at a time so you may miss some here and there

I never played in a private server, I remember it being based a lot on your class viability as well. But back in vanilla things were pretty wild and lawless anyway. But it’s definitely true for certain crafted items. Like Nightfall being great for raids and the armorsmith helmet being warrior bis.
---
Just making sure, by 3:20 you mean 3 hours twenty minutes right? I really forgot how long leveling took in vanilla. Even getting to level 10 was a milestone.
---
100% agree
---
Even top arena players felt that wrath was ridiculous but fun...except for when their healer gets TSG'd down in 10 globals through pain sup or playing a 10 min+ match of hiding and praying they don't get global'd by wizard cleave. 
---
I don't quite think they got PvP back to TBC levels but may more of a medium from wrath.
---
The dungeons were great and the opening raids I really liked especially Blackwing Decent.  Firelands was good but short enough that my casual 10 man full cleared heroic + achievements...
---
No need to say more since we all know how it ended...
---
king bangalash ?
---
I would agree with this, to an extent. Unfortunately achievements were long-used as a 'link this or you dont get an invite' gatekeeper. you couldn't get into raids if you didn't have it, and you couldn't get it without raiding. I would be in favor of them if they were entirely personal, unlinkable, uninspectable, unarmoryable, but they you just run into 'screen shot this and link it in discord'. there's really no  good way to add them unless they didn't include raid content.
---
literally the way you are celebrating this guy and people like him btw is the plot of borderlands 3 people like him are literally the villian and for good reason. $$$
---
You don't want to do that until after level 10 when you get your pet. The SW trainer will not have the quest for you.
---
Pve stats

Pvp ... you gonna need that plate

I don't know how familiar you are with modern Wow but both my professions are completely neutered(JC/Ench). Sockets barely exist and you can enchant 3 slots. Classic can't come soon enough.

Personally, I would have liked to see capturable bases/keeps/barracks/etc that when captured, allowed players to invest gold into them to bolster the defenses while simultaneously providing a daily gold reward to those that contributed.

"Whats the very very worst thing about prison?"
---
"The worst thing about prison was the -- the dementors! They were flying all over the place and they were scary and they came down and sucked the soul of of your and it **HOIRT**"
---
So a shared monopoly, goddamn that sounds sketchy.
---
Oh, my comment had nothing to do with crafting, I assure you of that much. I completely agree with you that something like Lionheart is BiS for a lot of Warriors (at least for a majority of Classic content) and Nightfall is a great pickup on a Meleeweaving Hunter—or some other equivalent utility spec—for raid debuffing. I was specifically only talking about Ironfoe.
---
mine looked about the same :D
---
its a shame everyone whould do shit like this has to do it from video
---
i still have not seen a detailed post where someone compares a heap of different damage and mechanics to vanilla
---
Toss up between dual spec and arenas. ~50% of my playtime is in arenas so not having it is probably going to suck and reduce the longevity of classic for me since after content is clear there is just wpvp and the same BGs over and over. I'm not a fan of killing lowbies or even ganking people that don't want to fight...It will eventually get old.
---
Desktop is the last place anyone would look for it.
---
No, I just got monster hunter World for PC, and after getting my save back in order, I’m trying out Hunting horn, and doing decent damage, with heavy movement/evade buffs and being able to significantly boost the party is really fun.
---
So what happens when a noob gets to 50 and realizes they dodnt choose the meta? Sucks to suck? They gotta reroll? That shit is difficulty for _no_ reason. Its doesnt affect anyone else if you can race change a toon. This is typical of this sub. Not everyone can afford high graphics, or fast internet either, should those people be punished too?
---
In theory - yeah it's fine to bring non-optimal specs
---
In practice - most pugs are still going to be pricks
---
yeah, 3 hours 20.
---
Current Pservers / repacks can do 1:30 or faster. But I'm seeing 2:30 or slower on Beta (with little to no competition) - I'm thinking a bit over 3 hours is gonna be nice.
---
But how? Its literally just saying that retail and classic players can agree on shitting on blizzard even if it's for different reasons
---
I felt the same with the sensationalist thumbnails and titles until I saw [this](https://youtu.be/DzRGBAUz5mA) video from LTT. I still don't really like them, but I understand it flat out nets more views to have clickbait thumbnails and titles even if the content is the same.
---
Normal revive on druid.
---
I want to play the class but screw not being able to rez properly!
---
Why specifically alliance? Are horde better off using the fury final talent and white attacks because windfury?
---
&gt; Go play current wow if you want it to be like current wow.
---
Ah yes, because of course not wanting to play 20 hour bgs means you want to play retail. Makes sense.
---
I dont think so
---
Yes, you are eligible and that is why you have the client on your launcher.   
---
When the test starts at 2:00 pm you may or may not be able to log in. Last time most of us could not get on, until 3 hours later, and then we all could get on.  So you may have to wait. But you can try at 2:00 pm.
---
Interesting.
---
Now if only I could keep from seeing posts about Rat-man on this sub.
---
As most faces do.
---
That's basically how I feel about it in real life too.
---
Wow damn, that’s fucked up. Nail the guy on something he can control at least.
---
Luckily I was in college before the "Adderall craze" was in full swing.  Too many kids on Adderall now a days, it's kinda sad.
---
I have most certainly abused adderall and played video games. Not WoW though
---
+1 left drak'thul for this reason.
---
You can control your teeth more than your face lmao.
---
I feel I'm in the minority here, but I simply never experienced this. Granted, I played AV from patch 1.9 onward, so I missed the very first iteration (which only lasted 4 months btw). But I simply do not remember experiencing a game of AV where objectives and PvP were ignored. Remember, TBC introduced reinforcements for a reason: because games were STILL lasting too long in Blizzard's opinion. For clarity, I am NOT in favor of adding the reinforcements to AV in classic. It was bad. But the point remains. Blizz clearly was not under the impression that AV games were lightning-fast Zerg rushes. But others may have had different experiences, I can't say. All I can share is that I never experienced the zergs that everyone is afraid of, and I played a lot of AV. Yes, even 1.12 AV.
---
I did read. You would rather play an MMO by yourself on two computers simultaneously rather than interact with other people, because you think being antisocial is "efficient"

No one will spend that much on it, and it’s not a rare recipe so anyone with a guild would know someone who can craft it for them at the price of half a stack of iron and a citrine.

LOL. One of my people! Absolutely hilarious.

meh people only want them because they were rare. if they dont exist they are not rare

they were rare because people did not know they would go away

we clearly know they would go away if they were in this time

meh i want my ugly AV ram back , i liked that ugly little fella
---
5/5 illumination is all you need in holy to be a good healer. No one used holy shock for 90% of vanilla coz it was shit. It was only around naxx that it was fixed enough that some pallies took it.
---
What limited guilds killing alot of bosses in vanilla wasnt specs. It was shitty pc's. Doing MC with an average fps of 10 was normal. Doing Rag with 5fps? Thats normal. Nefarian resses the skeleton dragons and your pc locks up was also normal. No one raided in vanilla with anything close to what we do now.
---
If they gave the combat abilities of legendaries via the 100-110 leveling experience then I agree. Those perks made classes fun.
---
They are making classic for the people that didn’t like the changes.  Is that difficult to comprehend?
---
Guild banks for 1000 Alex.
---
It works on pservers still since their ToS is looser and it isn't integrated into a player's B.net account.
---
Yes, I'm dying to get the beta. I literally load up other games for 2 or 3 minutes than just go back to watching twitch. Can NOT wait for classic oooooommmmmgggggg
---
I didn’t watch cartoons when I was a kid. I went over to my friends house and watched HIM watching cartoons.
---
Cause they didn't do any damage lol. Makes it tough to grind mats for all the raids u r doing if u grind at half the speed as dps
---
Hey any kind of Classic content is good with me, not sure why you guys are so against him lol.
---
I was 100% one of the players that loved LFG.  I was sick of trolling chat lfm especially without global chat(ie basically requiring having someone sitting in SW or IF spamming) which WAS in Vanilla for a time and on the new server I rolled on to push for end game it was fantastic to lfg for say SM while questing in STV.  We didn't have people spamming global or anything as I've heard from others who vehemently hate the idea of global chat.
---
This vid made me remember that the best guild I was ever a part of I met through grouping through instances.  It did help that it was a brand new server so everyone was pretty much friending all the good players they ran with in dungeons while leveling.  I honestly completely forgot...
---
I’m an ENTERTAINER!!!
---
Orc racials line up really well with dps melee classes, and stun resist is pretty boss in PvP, if a bit random. 1/4 of the time it works 100% of the time though
---
Finally, a streamlined way to ignore all of Tips garbage content.
---
Got the entire Herod set, spinning axe and all- On my hunter.

I think many of us, myself included, started a little after vanilla. I started in 2.1

Has there ever been a claim that Blizzard are doubling down on that has been shown to be wrong with proof?
---
I kidnapped.... The president's son..... And I didn't get caught neitha!

Not even
---
Wow, that's so interesting. So in that case, if you're trying to deadzone kite a warrior, then you should be constantly strafing/running in his deadzone rather than just moving, stopping, moving, stopping. I'm also curious if jumping at run speed is considered "running".
---
I kinda miss that. I wish the mail would take a certain length of time depending on where it is sent and where it is picked up. For example, mail sent from IF and picked up in the same mailbox or one in the same city would be instant. However mail sent from IF to SW would take 30 min or so to "arrive".  Org to Undercity would take an hour or so. Sure there are ways around this mechanic, but I'd still like to see it implemented.  You would only get a mail icon if you are within the delivery time/distance.

Not gunna happen but oh well.

I was first introduced to him on his twitch stream, never seen a YouTube vid of his but I do find his streams entertaining

Can't agree.  I have a character that transfers to all my games I play.  He's the same looking male and after 15 years of the same name and look, I take pride in using him in my adventures.    I feel like it's legit my partner online.

Not really any point to planning pre-BIS with Dire Maul gear. If you're any sort of Hardcore, you'll have cleared MC/Ony multiple times before it drops.
---
No. There is a fundamental difference in making classic wow better. and making classic wow a more enjoyable game for people who dont like it in the first place. 
---
Youre making the assumption that any change caters to the latter crowd.
---
Im not saying anyone browsing this forum should be tasked with implementing their version of an improved classic. But since none of us are, whats the harm in throwing around ideas?
---
Since about 1/2 way through BC (with the advent of daily quests) the game has been slowly and now more rapidly changing itself to appease people who didnt like the core of the game in the first place. 
---
People who want vanilla, people who will play classic--despite recognizing the flaws are seeking a different core gameplay experience than what is found on live. 
---
People want the refined, remastered classic experience.   
---
And yea, youre right there is a grey line. Is tmogging over the line? I think so. Others dont. Are guild banks? I dont see an issue there. 
---
How about the real substantive issues, though. Class combat mechanics, raid mechanics and the 16 debuff limit. Like them or hate them, it is an uphill battle to suggest the systems as is are not integral to the classic experience. Though I think its safe to say, removing the debuff limit, developing more challenging and engrossing bosses that have a larger individual skill demand on your raid, and developing sustained dps rotation mechanics more nuanced than slam 1 till imp. scorch is about to fall, then scorch are among the best changes to modern wow--from many perspectives the only improvement to wow. Where does one come down in that grey area? (lets not even consider how having "more combat buttons" changes low level leveling, and especially pvp (i prefer vanilla pvp due to the depth of its simplicity, live pvp is just cooldown management)
---
Even seemingly inconsequential things like respec capped at 5g or 50g have dramatic gameplay changes. 
---
As a result, I am totally in favor of #NoChanges. Its the one version of the game we can all agree on. But in 2021 blizzard will either release BC or reroll the classic servers (who knows they may do both). Personally, I will not play vanilla as it was a 3rd time. I either need improvements to classic while keeping the philosophy or i need BC. I suspect the majority of the folks who want to play classic again but havent been replaying classic since Cata on pservers are in the same boat.
---
About running to other starting zones, I tested it a little during the stress test for horde 
---
Orc/Troll to UD starting zone takes about 15 mins (can vary a little depending on zeppelin location, but low chance of dying), Orc/Troll to Tauren starting zone around 22 mins (barrens is pretty dangerous, so this depends a bit how many times you die. You can die on purpose and rest at spirit healer to save time), UD to Tauren starting zone around 32 mins (zeppelin and barrens, so this can vary quite a bit)
---
Outside NE being pretty far away, the other starting zones should be pretty easy to run to as well
---
But as other mentioned, if you run to a starting zone of a race who doesn’t have your class you play, then it could be pretty annoying
---
Threat gets added even after it is at 5 stacks (max). Sunder is one of your lower threat generating abilities though. Revenge and shield slam are far better.
---
This how I run for the police

Why would resto get geared fast?   Is the numbers of resto druids so low there's very little competition?

Hi, /u/bluemoe
---
You will be able to get AV rams though right?
---
I saw that video in vanilla and bought my shaman a fiery war axe (I think) for the level 39 bracket. I had a blast playing that character. At that level at least, shaman are a strong match up against a lot of classes. You have interrupts, snares, a dot, mobility, purge, fear removal and spell absorb.
---
I'm not immune to insomnia it can cause. If you wake up 30 minutes prior to launch start, play for 16 hours then take something like adderall or vyvanse, you will probably get to 30.5 hours awake time before it won't help keep you awake anymore. So you would still have to take it a 2nd time to hit 48 hours. Now if you can stay up 30 hours without stimulants, then sure, one would get you to 48. But you also just fried your brain chemically, won't sleep worth a fuck because of it, and that 3rd day is going to be complete ass. All to be, what, level 30-40? You're not even half way to 60 at that point. Stimulants work well for short term things. Leveling to 60 is not a short term thing.
---
If one of those is overrunning the sub? Then yeah definitely, I agree with you.
---
Denial and error.
---
Which is why I fully intend to get the .5 set (t0 until t.5 is out) in it's completion. Is it BiS? Not really but it looks cool. I plan on rogue so the 35 energy will be useful for a long time. That way, I can just enjoy raiding and not worry so much about t1 being complete.
---
Not once did I say that.
---
If he does that he will get more hate from the youtube community. Similar with the drama surrounding Pokimane.
---
#nochanges TBC
---
Haha. Fair enough. God bless. The memories are already pouring in! Haha
---
I think the idea is that there were a lot less people playing online at the time.  As many people pointed out WoW was many people's first foray into online multiplier gaming.  It nearly was for me but I chose GW1 first over WoW due to being a poor college student and not wanting to pay a sub(it only took about 2 months to go for it though after getting a taste).
---
We don't forget things such as this, manling.
---
In a later patch, they made mind flay attach to target faces for more face meltage.  It was more of less written like that in the patch note as well.  IN vanilla, it just attaches to the target body.  Not so face melty.
---
Blizz removed the ability to be afk in BGs pretty shortly after they were released. Typing /afk was basically the standard way to leave the BG. 
---
But yea, AVs that lasted hours just weren’t fun *for most people.* As players we were clamoring for them to balance it.
---
Also, your last paragraph is an additional reason to put on that act.  Same thing that almost every national talk show does.  As long as people talk about you, it benefits you.  Whether they hate or love you, it gets you out there and brings more people to you and more money.  I personally don't care for him either, but that's why I just avoid him which is what more people need to realize is the way to deal with that type of thing.  To OP's credit though, they just used him as an example I think, it didn't entirely seem focused on him but I could be wrong.  Anyway, good points.
---
Exact same. I want to enjoy the journey. I'm not concerned with hitting max level as fast as possible or anything like that. I just want to be immersed in azeroth.
---
Lmao you're another one who didn't even read the original argument. 
---
Someone makes an offhand comment about how the game changing around battlegrounds made it better from a pvp stand point and that players asked for it and you all come flying out of the wood work trying to defend it as if someone insulted your mother.
---
Youre comparing apples and oranges. Guild wars two was marketed and designed specifically to work without the gear treadmill, unlike world of warcraft.
---
And even then, they couldnt resist adding a gear quality above exotic for their most prestigious gear. And it takes months, if not longer to farm a full ascended set. And even before ascended armor, they had agony resist earrings that you could farm almost indefinetly for completing high level fractals.
---
I havent played guild wars two much since before heart of thorns, but it was certainly not without any gear grind back then, even if they marketed it as having none.
---
Flying is gonna be $#&amp;@ing awesome!
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
One of my favs, In AV as alliance, Mind control the horde off the bridge.
---
&gt; spec can be re picked for a fee up to 50 gold. What I want is that fee to go up to 25gold.
---
And what I want is for the gold cost to be removed and replaced with an increasing cooldown. Say, one day to start, doubling every time, maybe capping at 32 days. Specifically, I would like to make the "weekly respec" nonsense completely impossible.
---
But neither change will happen, so we'll just have to be happy with a gold cost, but a significant one.
---
RIP Limewire
---
The graphicsss. Thats really what its all about.

May 2005 here
---
Downward player level-synching and permanently relevant currency rewards for running older content keep it relevant in FFXIV. Granted, that's mostly in terms of daily roulettes, and there's no relevant reward for doing old raid content synched... but there's no reason another game couldn't do that.
---
I do think that level inflation has to stop at a point. Somehow GW2 has done fine with a level cap of 80 since launch, despite going through two expansions.
---
I can’t really focus on games on stimulants . Unless I’m drunk and hit some cocaine to level me out, I’ll just be jumping around
---
&gt; Maybe if we ask nicely, while Blizzard is fixing up the old engine, we can get native support? 
---
They aren’t fixing up the old engine. It’s the current existing engine. They aren’t going to port it for the Classic client if they aren’t doing it for retail when it is is going to have even less players and therefore even less demand for it.
---
Not as sweet as minor beastslayer 😎
---
All servers get rolled over to TBC. New servers with no transfers allowed pop up that still have Vanilla. That's my prediction.
---
Great example of a bug killing a Vanilla moment.
---
I wouldn't push this as layering as it's not supposed to work that way. There's actually quite a few issues it has that needs to be ironed out. We've seen people move layers while solo. That's not how it should work, either.
---
In favor of Horde?

Screw that noise!

I'm actually looking for a way to use my big recliner chair at a desk. The desks are just too elevated. If anyone can offer me advice, hmu.

Think I’m gonna try the spread out meals, healthier , and some water, Gatorade and coffee. I’ve tried every other method lol. If I can play for 15 hours , pass out for 6 and repeat.. I don’t see the point of staying up 40 hours to feel like shit and make the future leveling a pain in the ass

Cdew has been playing enhance on the beta and seems to be doing well and having fun, utilizing totems, off healing, helping burst down FC or healers with big WF hits

Yep but I also had Counter-Strike and Unreal Tournament GOTY Edition and Diablo 2

No chance of a native client, but [Wine works fine](https://redd.it/bpub25).

Path of exile has a new league coming next Friday. That should last me at least two months

That was pretty common back then honestly, everyone that I knew irl that played back then would either click EVERYTHING or only use the hotkeys for 1-6 and then click whatever else is on the bar.

I remember watching someone play rogue during a lan party and he had his important moves on the extra action bars on the right side, closest to the center of the screen. I remember going "oh wow that actually lets me see a bit of whats going on instead of only looking at the bottom of my screen to click". Pretty much nobody outside of people who were playing a ton of wc3 tft ladder or sc:bw would add hotkeys to the extra action bars in my experience.

SSI Disability does not work like that..sorry. You can be so fucked up you scream from ptsd all day and not feel safe to leave your bedroom and they will still deny you.

Probably not worth the effort to mention small changes during actual testing, as only a tiny fraction of affected people would read it anyway.  They do post about the next content updates to the beta though, as they did when they turned on the PvP System:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/in-development/wow-classic-beta-test
---
Slow 2h equals way less flurry procs though? Also way less rage generation?
---
How are we able to partake in this stress test?
---
that's why I said seemingly right? I just said the reason why some people would assume that you hate the person that you used as an example. Of course, I don't have any say on what you use as an example. I'm just voicing the reason why there are opinions like that here.  
---
A better example for that is using "insert person name here". So that you wouldn't get those remarks. I know that you want to just help people and I commend that. I am not your enemy by any means.
---
That dude is all over class wow subreddit spewing this shit.
---
Congrats! Welcome to the worse-than-crack addiction.
---
Blizzard needs to say something about layering.  The fact that they relied on 3rd party streamers to reveal layering is not good imo.  There are a ton of questions about it and they've given us no info.
---
I’ve never done the pre change sunken temple and am quite excited for it. I’ve read great things.
---
It’s beta. Not intended to work this way.
---
\#nochanges
---
Wow, very interesting stuff. Has a lot of implications in pvp for optimal play.
---
Also, if a player is jumping at run speed, are they still considered running? And if so, what if they're jumping at a speed where they'd be walking if grounded?
---
I saw someone saying warrior tanks are first/high consideration for getting thunderfury? Is that true, I’d consider tanking and raid leading for that, so I could PvP in the side and fuck people up. 
---
But I don’t know if it’s that useful for tanking or if it was sarcasm....
---
Yeah, thats bad.
---
Yes, I'm not sure why that's surprising. Warriors "tanked" with 2handers frequently in classic, which means they were a dps.
---
Leveling takes so long you'll be in the same range unless one of u plays a lot more
---
wish it worked like that on recommended but it keeps serving up his stuff, partly because others keep reposting it.
---
I limit myself to games only when the kids are in bed and everything's done. Usually 8-9PM to 11 or 12. Works for me
---
I would lean towards orc I think
---
UD is going to be so common, that they likely reduce the amount of Warlocks on alliance. So Orcs benefit from the stun resist, but also from UDs scaring away warlocks. So it kinda double dips
---
Oh man, if that's true I'm going to gun for Sulfuras and respec for Reckoning. :o
---
I remember Omerta. Pretty sure I ran flags with you guys for a while. Frostmane had an amazing population before the first huge wave of new servers. Lots split over to Kalecgos-US.
---
Pservers for the last year, haven't seen a single 2h furry warrior, except from 30 to 40 after getting WW axe and before getting MS.
---
&gt;  non techies 
---
As a life long programmer who lives his life around it I absolutely despise the word "Tech" and anyone who is interested in "technology"
---
Totally. I'm looking forward to leveling at least as much as I am to end game. Probably fifty fifty split, maybe even heavier on playing through zones.
---
I only played through wrath, so I never experienced that, but it totally makes sense! That would really be a drag if it turned into that.
---
To be fair, if there was no timer there would be no challenge. I will concede that the rush mentality isn’t helpful for new players, but it gives veterans something to work towards.
---
The only way I could see them in Classic would be if they were very few but HUGE ones like exploring the whole Azeroth, completing ALL quests in the game you can etc. No "get to level 60" or killing a boss. Maybe one where you slay every boss in the game as well. They should be real achievements and not these joke of an achievement as in retail.
---
40 grit isn't so bad
---
Ah thanks for the link! That was a great ability, makes sense considering I was mostly a warrior in vanilla. I absolutely loved playing hunter after that. I might have been confusing it with disengage where it allowed you to jump back. Wingclip plus disengage was a nasty oh shit combo
---
Ah the Path of Exile defense lol.
---
Sure: https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/rogue-talents/?tal=305300105041351302300000000000000005005002000000000
---
I used this setup for solo open pvp.  Having prep is nice, but seal fate gives you an incredible amount of control and burst.  You can only have camo or MoD, and I think camo is better.  I think the build really shines at 5 piece tier 1 bonus, which gives you 120 energy total.  Before you get 5/8 Nightslayer sub is probably just as good.
---
The wombo combo was CS --&gt; BS  --&gt; Gouge --&gt; 4/5pt KS --&gt; thistle tea --&gt; BS --&gt; BS --&gt; Cold Blood 4/5 pt Evis.  Not only is this insane damage, it's also a 100% perfect stunlock, giving them no chance to do anything.   Could also blind at the end and repeat minus cold blood.  Against warriors if they are still alive could usually evasion tank them down.
---
I certainly wasn't the best rogue player, but in my experience with classic rogues was the second you let someone out of stun you could lose.  Hunter scattershots, you're dead.  Dwarf priest fears you, you're dead.  Lock deathcoils, its off to the races and you're dead.
---
Idk why people ever thought otherwise... that’s how it was in vanilla. Can you imagine if you had to full spec prot war to tank lvling dungeons? You’d never do them.
---
They can't do that because old models have different animation rigging. Just like how they can't add in the old models as they were into current WoW, regardless of that deceptive toggle option that technically exists.
---
...before the nerf hits.
---
Its obviously not intended
---
Lol it's obviously a bug. A 3 people on one layer join groups and then it randomly teleports them all to a new layer? I'm gonna go with bug.
---
Discovering this spec has been a godsend for my mental health.
---
Yup... Ended up getting my original acc perma banned in...wotlk? Maybe? For botting. (Stupid kid)
---
Being tired isn't the same as being able to sleep. I'm agreeing with you, but instead of going into detail of erratic thoughts, and poor decision making skills, etc, I just said tired. Hence me saying
---
&gt; tired as fuck but can't sleep
---
What vernacular do you prefer oh technical one?
---
Since the quest entails killed the satyr is Dire Maul it will be phase 2. Though may be able to start the quest chain and then wait for phase 2 then complete it. 
---
Unless god forbid they change the quest.
---
They do have exact values m8, they overtune them on purpose
---
What's the microwave for? Ppl get hungry on adderall?
---
Earthen Ring represent! A smaller community, but I stuck with it. I can't remember any guilds I was in though..
---
It's actually more then 1/4, because of iniate 5% stun resist. So orcs have 30% total. Up to 45% if you're a warrior with the talent. 
---
Which is why orc warriors is such a pita for ally rogues, and warriors are generally dangerous to rogues. But an orc one... is so much worse. 
---
Been playing on both sides of the end. Getting cheapshot or kidneyshot resisted is such a boon.

Maybe in actual Vanilla, not today. No one is friendly

I wonder what people will say when something like this happens after release?

Why are you a programmer if you're not interested in technology?  Or do you just hate yourself?

Hehe yeah I was a big cow warrior rocking Ashkandi. We had some good times running premades with y’all. I think we had something like 10 ashkandi’s drop for us but we had bad luck with wrath gear lol
---
Oh hey great call
---
I feel like hatching this scheme just further justifies the disgnosis.
---
tbh it's hard to call the took kit that compromises ret paladin a "class" *per se*.
---
I completely agree
---
Yeah, for sure. I'm not really knocking anyone for clicking early in vanilla, it's just funny to watch when it's this extreme. 
---
My friends and I all came from Diablo II where F1-8 were used for abilities and 1-4 for potions, so binding everything to buttons around 1-5 came as a natural next step once I knew my class a bit better. I obviously did click some abilities for a long time, but still, seeing clickers like this guy clicking on '2' with the mouse is so far on the other extreme that I can't help but be shocked.
---
So they're perfect for rp-pvp??

Someone who wants views and likes I guess

Undead priest. Water breathing and levitate.

I feel the same way about gnomes, fucking refugee runts. Ironforge needs to Brexit their midget asses out of town.

the year is 2070.  Classic V12.0 is about to launch.  Ive spent nearly seventy years doing this but alas. I must play Vanilla through Legion just one more time.

The "no changes" crowd should want buffs to dungeons &amp; raids. Vanilla wasn't immensely hard, but it also wasn't trivially easy. 
---
Without buffs, classic will be a joke. No changes!
---
YTA. 
---
Sorry wrong place
---
Yeah we've known this lol
---
Oh...hey look!
---
The shame thread about the same thing by someone who is misinformed and wasting everyone's time.
---
Please read into this yourself before you try and spew unneeded hate on this topic. Blizzard has already made a comment about this and this is not intended.
---
IIRC, Joana's assumes you do no instances. You can easily fill the gaps in with instance running, which should be pretty easy when the server is populated with people leveling.
---
troll male for the fisher looks.
---
No, there has been a rumor since OG Vanilla that there is a vendor that spawns in the secret cave for X amount of minutes X times a year and they sell a bengal tiger mount. It's entirely false but it was fun spreading it around.
---
Yup car crash I believe
---
Are they actually not sending any more invites for tomorrow....
---
Arigato!
---
I would agree with you if they didn't set themselves on a path of recreating Vanilla. Some things are gonna stay, some aren't, but everything is worth mentionning cause it's ALL gonna add up. If you have too much of these QoL details, you end up a bit closer to retail, that's just how it is. So I understand your point, but mentionning a bug (edit: an inconsistency rather) is the right way to go.
---
Interesting flavor choice!
---
Is the modern fanbase really casual? From a distance, it seems like the main audience today is hardcore raiders/diehard wow fans who can't imagine playing another game. Casual MMO players have much better options these days.
---
lotta food for those little bags bro
---
I like this one.
---
This very post is all about NOT just taking Blizzards word for it but instead dlingindependsnt research....and concluding that blizzard is correct regarding this question.
---
It’s in beta, the point of beta is to find these issues.
---
Well then good for you. You'd be surprised how much trivial stuff we tend to forget. But remembering that there were portals in WSG 12.5 years ago is of utmost importance.
---
Other terms to filter out:
---
 * TBC
---
 * Post-vanilla
---
 * After
---
 * Ideas
---
 * Best
---
 * Jebaited
---
Just to spell out the math:
---
Chance for recipe to drop = 0.1% = 0.001  
---
Chance for recipe not to drop = 1 - Chance to drop = 99.9% = 0.999  
---
Opportunities to drop = 100  
---
Overall chance to not drop = Chance not to drop ^ (Opportunities) = 0.999^100 = 0.9047 = 90.5%  
---
Overall chance to drop = 1 - (Chance not to drop ^ (Opportunites) = 1 - 0.999^100 = 0.0952 = 9.5%
---
Over 200 kills, the odds are merely 18.1%.  
---
Over 500 opportunities, the odds of seeing it are still only 39.4%.  
---
Over 1000, the likelihood increases to 63.2%.  
---
WolframAlpha solves the equation `100*(1-0.999^(n))=50` aka the number of kills/opportunities to reach 50% chance for a 1% drop rate item - the infamous coin flip - at 692.8. Last I checked, no loot is awarded for 0.8 of a kill, so we need to round up to 693.
---
Yay, statistics!
---
Dwarf hunter.  Fishermen should have glorious beards and you always need a pet dog to sit with you while you fish.
---
The unarmored mounts aren't in the game because they were removed in 1.4 and we're playing 1.12. Simple.
---
Thank you for taking the time to tell me how dumb I am.  Please link the Blizzard comment that address this exact issue so I can better educate myself and not hurt you eyes with my hateful posting.
---
I'm gonna save us all
---
I'm the Jesus of classic wow
---
The waiting game.
---
I'm a little confused about your point because I think we are actually in agreement.
---
I wouldn't have any problem if at some point Blizzard released CLASSICENHANCE, as long as they kept some servers as pure unchanged vanilla.
---
I don't think anyone is bad or even necessarily wrong for wanting to improve vanilla, I'm simply saying there is no good way to actually implementing *any* of those changes without risking the quality of the game.
---
The issue is not any given person having an idea for a change. The issue is you very quickly end up having 10,000 people in a forum thread all wanting a different change. 
---
I could be misreading you, but it seems like what you're saying is self-contradictory. You think people should be allowed to want changes, but you don't think any changes should be allowed?
---
I mean, I guess I agree with that. I certainly think people are entitled to their opinions. And I definitely am in favor of #NoChanges.
---
Playing the beta
---
utmost, hardly. But baked in if you played enough to get warlord? more than likely.
---
Finishing the apex season pass... hating every minute of it. I need classic!
---
playing F5
---
Yeah the scenes when the no changes crew realise they've been playing with changes. No doubt blizz will be blamed for the game being easier than on private servers.
---
New season and raid for Destiny 2 comes out in a week. That'll tide me over.
---
I know, that's why my question was specifically about what if it happened after the release.
---
Oh fuck yes
---
He said basically “I’ll never put in the effort to edit these vids myself so if someone else wants to post them why should I care?”
---
Yeah, that's what I used to do when I played. I work early mornings now though. Kids dont go to sleep until like 8 or 9 if I'm lucky. By then im too tired to do much of anything Haha.
---
It's still almost three months until release and this Beta is for finding out what works and what doesn't.
---
This is not a released game, it's a closed beta and I am quite sure that the devs are aware of it not working properly.
---
I’m just here to watch my favorite streamers
---
I mean, how else could you do this?
---
We can't exactly login to official Vanilla servers anymore to compare. Private servers are verifiably, and admittedly, overturned so using them for comparison data simply wouldn't work.
---
Do u have a map/guide that shows you where to aoe farm per level?
---
Money. 
---
Youtube is so fucking terrible that these stream clip channels (leeches) can easily rake in millions of views worth of ad revenue before Asmongold, or his affiliates, can strike them down or have them demonetized.

Not that you know of 8-)
---
nbd. stop bitching.
---
Thanks for the post, I will keep this stat spread in mind for talent/build ideas. Interesting to see differing opinions, I certainly like the rotation. I am curious, in your case you did not get 5/5 master of deception, do you find you get spotted easily? I have not played a 60 rogue in classic ever, played in TBC and I have recently hopped on a vanilla private server to test out leveling paths and the gameplay on rogue. I feel like I get spotted from so far away while in stealth and it blows my mind coming from playing retail most recently. Is MoD not worth it, or do you naturally get better stealth as you progress in classic?
---
R)
---
Shaman for Water Walking. It lasts 10 minutes rather than 2 minutes for Levitate. Shaman also has Water Breathing but fishing is all on the surface, there is no need to submerge. Shaman is also easier to deal with unintended mobs rather than Priest, and Wolf Form gives you 40% speed buff starting at level 20.
---
Pserver, trying to decide on a main for classic.  Practicing leveling swiftly.  Familiarizing myself with classic again.
---
Never played Destiny, but always hear it mentioned. Is it like a shooter mmo or something?
---
I'm playing the waiting game... Now that we're only 3 months away I've become so obsessed with this game that I can't seem to find anything interesting to play anymore.
---
I just wish I could put myself into a coma and wake up in three months.
---
That’s a really intricate design for a feature which most people wouldn’t really notice lol.
---
the google docs game
---
Armor isn't all that important for DPS, you shouldn't be receiving any white hits.
---
Everything else really depends on your level.
---
Its almost too crowded lol
---
I've played Path of Exile for over 2k hours now, and I still haven't found your mirror.
---
Didn't discover WoW until TBC, but I have played classic servers. I \*really\* like classic and wish i did enjoy it back then, however I was young (I am nearing 24 years old). I am tired of retail, I hate BFA. Legion was good, I enjoyed most of it. I really want to play classic, and I'm so pissed off that it comes out 2 days after classes start for me. Oh well, classes and studying will help me not get burned out.
---
I really enjoy the War of the Ancients trilogy.  I just recently finished Durotan on audiobook, which was really good!
---
Lol fuck Pokemane.  Never played a day of wow in her life and she still got beta access.
---
It's kind of sad that people know so much more now so a big issue is going to be specs will likely be checked and people will go full elitist on it... When it just kind of doesn't really matter for the most part lol
---
Pff you don't already have a bag of poopsocks ready? Casual.
---
I've messed around on the pservers and stuff. It all just feels so pointless to me knowing it's going to be deleted. I think I need to go with a single player game.
---
Maybe I'm older but during classic wow my refreshments of choice were cheap beer and good weed.
---
I can’t decide if I want to level my favorite a rogue for pvp first or level a Druid so I can get 60 quicker
---
Haven't watched any streams recently but based on the wording of the blue post, WSG was only available over the weekend. Not sure tho.
---
Some are definitely better than others.  Generally, you can't go wrong with Golden.  *Most* of Knaak's books are good.  If I remember correctly, Grubb was kind of disappointing.

https://web.archive.org/web/20070105001726/http://evilempireguild.org/guides/acstamina.php
---
Though this only considers Stamina vs AC in physical fights. There are quite a lot of fights where an important boss ability is magical damage making armor much less important than stamina for survivability.
---
Thanks, that's all I needed
---
Yeah, it's a "looter shooter" and easily the best one available. Good story, lots to do, and figuring out the mechanics of a new raid when it releases is insane. The developers love to hide secrets, which is something I wish WoW did more of.
---
Some races can't ride other mounts, so make sure to consider that. However, I think the PVP epic mounts don't have a racial restriction(?).
---
One big thing to keep in mind is, instead of the 90:10 cost split of training:mount that you're used to from current WoW, I believe Classic will use the 10:90 ratio instead, so mounts themselves will cost 1k gold whereas the training is 100, before rep discounts.
---
ikr? Bunch of fuckin' casuals coming up with this shit.
---
Windfury is strong, which makes slam not as necessary because you can do great damage simply by spamming Hamstring for the 20% windfury procs.
---
If topping the meters isn't my concern but more so PvP, will I be happy choosing an spriest over a mage?
---
I can already hear the music
---
With everything being released in their 1.12 version, it makes sense that the mounts also are
---
I wonder how many would get the unarmored version, if both versions are available all the time. If they are available all the time, then there would be no rush, but also not special
---
I wonder if people who wants unarmored, just want them to show off when they are removed anyway
---
I ended up throwing away or vendoring almost every pet I ever got in Vanilla, and I only ever bought two mounts.  
---
When they were changed to act like spells rather than items, I went and got EVERYTHING, just so I could finally have some choices.
---
Messenger 7.5, TS2, and BROODWAR. This is awesome, very nostalgic.
---
They could at least add Kara as a 20-man.
---
Long cd like 48h would make it useless for the most part. If you were a healer and for example wanted to dual spec into dps to farm mats you'd need to be at least 2 full days between raiding days to use it. 24h would be more than enough to restrict. Probably even just few hours. If dual spec with a cd was in they'd probably have to also make it so you can change the spec even before the cd is over by paying some sum just for those times where you really need to and it'd be retarded to have to respec  and have the same spec twice.
---
Yup. Level 8
---
Blizzard in the same interview where they mentioned people misreporting Warlock summons as incorrect also said that people were also misreporting that charge put you into combat, and just the auto-attack that put you into combat. Old videos showed that it was actually their reference client that was not correct and it was in fact wrong in the Demo. They obviously eventually agreed as charge is now working correctly in the Beta
---
Don't forget the hard link to msconfig lol
---
Nope. 15
---
idk probably "blizzard please fix this bug"
---
Wait so what does it mean in patch 1.9 when it says out-of-zone chat channels disabled?
---
Why get so mad over something other people enjoy? You said that you even enjoyed it at one point. 
---
I dont get how someone can be this way. Must be miserable.
---
t0.5 did look really cool. I did rogue as well in vanilla. t0.5 was really fun to get, although I could never get the cap and chest because after all the scholo runs I did throughout vanilla, I never got the t0 cap :/ by far the worst luck I've ever had trying to get a single item in wow.
---
Ahh the og right here
---
I still have those runic power potions from the death knight starting zone in my bank. I made my DK when wrath launched.
---
Some day I will pass those potions down to my children.
---
Thanks so much for this man.  It gave me a new perspective and understanding of what Vurtne was doing and how the build worked.  I was a Rogue main from Vanilla-WoTLK, but it's looking as though I'll be a Mage this time around.  I've always been big into PvP so Elemental is definitely something that interests me.  I may need more advice from you in the future.
---
This hits way too close to home
---
Dragon Quest 11 and Warframe.
---
&gt;elemental or balance
---
They're talking about both resto specs
---
If you don't take them regularly, you can, but like anything, your body will adjust over time and it won't occur anymore.
---
That’s what I played too. Dual firey enchant for me please
---
ADHD thank you. And it lasts about 4 hours. And I once read about someone being arrested on meth and how much they had taken. Calculated they took about 2 full months worth of what I take twice a day. On the other hand, it really gives me focus when I'm farming ore and herbs...
---
That's not true, though. They've given info on layering and streamers did not uncover it. Whether or not you believe Blizzard on the info regarding layer is up to you and I'm not here to argue with anyone or defend Blizzard's product before it's officially released. However, from your comment, you seem to imply (and perhaps I'm mistaken here and if so I apologize) that layering is just something the community is learning about all on our own with no official information regarding, which is explicitly false.
---
Have they announced which phase t0.5 will be released it? It was after AQ event in vanilla
---
A family that slays together stays together.
---
This shit should not exist beyond the starting zones for the first week.
---
we are in agreement. That said, too many #NoChanges people dont think any deeper than "Muh Vanillaz".
---
My direct point is yes, who cares if people muse about changes they may want, the coming set of servers are decidedly NoChanges. 
---
But yes, my dream is ClassicMuseum servers, a Classic+ server and a progressive NoChanges server running from 1.12 through HLK (okay Ruby Sanctum).
---
Id hope to see lengthy and open debate between developers and players on the new features and refinements added to Classic+ as they come in. No change should be made without having players and devs in agreement and with said change being inline with some sort of publicly stated design philosophy document. Essentially the design philosophy is a governing document, developers come to players with proposed changes and players and devs debate the viability of said changes.
---
I like the majority of vanilla wow, small things like auto standing when casting a spell from sitting are the things im keen to amend. Most large systems that involve time investment ill defend till im blue in the face. But the game drags when youre in a 40 man raid--unless youre a healer or tank then the game is actually better than live (imagine! thinking about threat and having to think about who you heal not just every GCD with an action)
---
"then... Why are you in prison?"
---
Yin*
---
I don't have a single programmer or engineer friend who uses the word tech or technology. The people who use these words are completely non technical and know absolutely nothing about engineering. They watch youtube videos on "technology" and consider themselves knowledgeable and spout off retarded opinions which are just recycled catch phrases from shitty youtubers
---
You’re first paragraph is inherently wrong. Taking a break is a smaller set back today than it was in earlier expansions. For example, I quit 6 months ago, resubbed 9 days ago because I was bored. My ilvl is &gt; current heroic raid drops and I’m 60% of the way to the last meaningful neck level (48, to unlock the last azerite power on all gear currently available). Catch up mechanics make it easier to catch up, not harder. Also, for your raid argument, yea there’s only 1 raid per tier but the tier cycles are significantly shorter than they used to be. Nowadays you’ll do the same tier for ~4 months and have multiple difficulties to include all players meaning more people get a chance to raid. Back in the day the tiers lasted longer and significantly less people stepped into raids since there wasn’t an “easy” version for them.
---
ITS OVER 9000!!!!!
---
'it wasn't intended'
---
but that won't change the fact that it's in the game
---
I played through DQ11 a few months ago actually. Really enjoyed it overall. Really wish there were other similar turn based rpgs on the ps4
---
See you there fellow testers! Let's get the show on the road.
---
In Omar we trust.
---
But if you pick the undead Mohawk to start with, do you ever need to change to anything else?
---
Druids are only marginally better at leveling than Rogues. It might shave off 10% or about half a day.
---
I feel like I've known a few girls that really dug being able to turn into a cat even if they weren't the best at the class.
---
Diablo 2, never gets old.
---
Sounds pretty cool. Would it be worth getting into at this point while waiting on classic? Or would I not really have enough time?
---
You could in vanilla anyway. I remember rogue tanking up to SM pretty easily
---
1:30 is the very top end of 1-10, it's more like 1:45.
---
Is beta really that much slower? I don't have the beta but I'm pretty convinced that it'll be faster. 
---
I've been working on my Human route as well, and quests like Goldtooth are legit impossible for me to do on my Warrior at level 6 or 7. I just cannot kill mobs in that place fast enough to make kiting double packs viable as there's respawns behind me, and I can die with a dobule pull. Tried working all different ways around it to try and save money for gear and such but just can't get there.
---
I assume it has to be easier on classic. It's already known that mob health for mangos servers is too high for example, and armour values are all over the place. I've been really doubting the damage calculations lately and looking over the code to try and find something. I'll definitely be doing a lot of testing tomorrow so I can try and at least fudge the numbers to get something more similar to classic for personal running the starting 1-10.
---
While this scenario should have kept them in the same layer there are plenty of other scenarios where this kind of thing would happen "legitimately"
---
Imagine you are in a cave doing a quest, and someone messages you asking if you want to run SM Cathedral. You say yes, they invite you, you accept. But the group leader was in a different layer, so now the cave that you just half-cleared is now completely full of mobs and you are helplessly surrounded with no chance to escape alive.
---
I've been leaning druid lately but it changes every other day lol
---
Thats a fun one too.
---
TBF im not sure, ill see if I can dig up anything. But I was in raiding guilds prior to BWL and we had /rtzspriests /rtzstanks and /rtzsdps that lasted all through vanilla. Massive amounts of shit talking went down in the healer channel (was my /5 ) about morons who died all the time.
---
Thats were we did our raid assignments, Exorsus Raid Tools didnt exist then.
---
Pleeeease let this happen it will be my life I will find ALL THE BUGS :o
---
Yeah, I was doing that for a while. Leveled a bunch of classes to 20 and I still can't decide haha. Knowing that the character will be deleted sort of ruins it for me in the end.
---
You can't really believe something as simple as the use of a word, disregarding the fact that that word is "science", can truly generalize people in such a way...
---
Generalizations are a slippery slope my friend
---
Yeah in leaning Druid today but who knows. 3 months is gonna suck
---
From what i remember it was in the tunnel and that room with the ramp that you couldn't use the forms but in the open to the sky room with the flag you could use those forms.
---
I don’t understand.  You control the hunter and slave the Druid. Use interact with target and click to move on the Druid and the hunter can stay at range and the Druid will run to the target.
---
That's not a bad idea actually. It's been a good 6 or 7 years since I last played.
---
This is the most wholesome shit ever. We all just wanted to have a little glowing effect on our weapons.
---
Why isn’t everyone talking about this?! If the dude ran it at 30, ofc its a cake walk!
---
Diablo 3 season 17
---
asmon is lvl 25 in his sfk , the game is a joke on private servers mostly. Private servers are overtuned to compensate for players having 15 years of experience and knowledge. Classic wont be tuned like that, its going to be how it was then so it will be super easy. The game is in no way challenging, majority of people were playing wow as their first mmo experience and were also young. Computers were struggling to get decent fps, internet connections were bad etc. Dont be surprised to see groups chainpulling in instances and raids
---
It wasn't really on purpose.
---
Unpopular Opinion, but the mount journal. I'm a collector and I want all of the classic mounts without my bags creaking under the strain
---
Ew
---
This is great!
---
Never played it before so I think im gonna now.
---
They were a terrible guild then.
---
You're not alone...
---
https://i.imgur.com/HckVjsG.jpg
---
Still haven't found myself yet...
---
now its "kick tank or I leave" - heals/top dps
---
That's exactly what I'm doing!  On my fourth one now and no closer to a decision.  I'm thinking since we get to reserve 3 names that I'll level mage, druid, warrior.  Mage to farm, druid to raid, and warrior ... hopefully.  Not at all certain though if that's gonna be my decision in a couple months though.  I can't even decide on the third name to reserve!
---
So I'm curious, are you excited for classic or did you do all that effort to rain on the parade of people excited for classic?
---
the guy saying "FUCKING STREAMERS" in party LOOOOOOOOOL that was fucking great
---
Gotcha, we're definitely on the same page then lol
---
I'd probably choose unarmored because i want a more "clean" mount. Atleast for frostsaber versions.
---
I found one once.. I'm still a bit of a poe noob, I level up to 90 or so every season do a couple tiers of the maps then call it a season.  So anyways there I was farming away and this mirror drops..  I look it up online and it looks like it might be worth some good currency.  I decide to sleep on it and do some more research before selling it.  So the next day I decided I was bored with POE and never played that season again.  It was a while later that I remembered I never used that mirror.
---
Warriors become an unstoppable killing machine, rogues hide from warriors, and that is what we call balance.
---
Well this is disheartening for people like me who want to experience classic because it was hailed as a more challenging game.
---
Just fyi you cant insta-shift ghost wolf in vanilla, even if you have it talented it's still like a 1 second cast time.
---
herb+alch is the best profession combo to make money. Raiders and PvPers will be buying consumables all through the lifespan of the server.
---
There's a few guides out there on youtube that helps with it.
---
Or nolife in BG's until you get the gear haha
---
But yeah, anyway you cut it, its Vanilla WoW. If you want gear you're grinding. In raids or BG's.
---
If you're a healer (or tank), then you can get into any group content you want, any time you want, but you're less good soloing.
---
If you're dps, you are very capable on your own, but will have to work harder or wait longer to get into groups.
---
That's the tradeoff. And tradeoffs are good gameplay. Asking for a "both" option cheapens the whole thing.
---
Fresh meat
---
I'm not mad at all, just 100% fed up having to listen to kids trying to be the next Ninja for 6 hours every damn day.  
---
If they could enjoy the game quietly within their social group I'd have no problem, but they're obnoxious as fuck.
---
We are not playing 1.12 however, a modified version of it yes. For example: Mounts costs a lot and training very little for classic because this is how it was for the majority of vanilla. But if it were 1.12 then mounts would be cheap and training would cost a lot instead. Also if you want to keep it simple you are not allowed to have phases and just release everything at once right?
---
There are more things that are not 1.12, if you are interested in that i suggest you look that up.
---
Im saying they have never comeout with any post or official announcement about their 'fancy new tech'.  The info we have is what they told streamers, and what they said in interviews with streamers that you have to dig through youtube to find.
---
The LFG Tool
---
#***NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH DUNGEON FINDER OR LFR, THEY ARE DIFFERENT***
---
For those that have no idea what the LFG Tool is, basically, its a board type thing where you can create and advertise groups for ... well, anything: looking for a questing partner, looking for a group to grind with, roleplaying (including ERP...), fishing parties, city raids, city/world defense, dance parties, filling slots in raids/dungeons with PUGs, hunting rares/elites, sharing world/class buffs - the possibilities are endless. TLDR: imagine the TBC summon stone interface but expanded a bit, also you **can't** summon people or teleport with it.
---
The LFG Tool, in its current Retail state, wouldn't fit into Classic - it's *too* handy. Maybe limit it to faction cities or rested areas only, obviously limit it to server (retail can group with people from any server), no teleporting to zones or players. I think it would be pretty balanced, its just like World chat, but a little less spammy. Oh, and remove the ilvl restriction - that shit ain't needed.
---
It also keeps the community... well... a community. You'll still see the same players out and about in these groups and about the world since it would be limited to the server.
---
I usually play with my toes while watching will and grace spew feces into each others bellybuttons.
---
Addon to show your healing numbers in green above the targets head.
---
I don't think that's true, a Nost dev was tweeting about how they had to wing a bunch of the values since they didn't have any of the source code or a game to reference, and most people remembered the game being much harder than it was which lead to pservers being harder
---
(I actually never out points in it cuz it wasnt damage related, not gonna lie)
---
"I started in TBC (or later)"
---
"What comes after classic?"
---
Two statements are almost always paired by posters here.
---
Dope!
---
It could proc off of Stormstrike.  
---
It just couldn't proc off of itself anymore.
---
Thanks. I might do dungeons next.
---
Slay the spire and for the king are both fun if you want ideas while waiting
---
I wish they had just temporarily mega sharded the starting zones and called it a day
---
Lol no doubt but sometimes it's the small things that aren't noticed that actually make games better. At least for some people.
---
No piss bucket/bottle(s)? F**king casuals.
---
Brought it today and crashed 4 times in 3 hours :/ guess I’ll wait for stability patches...
---
I've worked in the sciences for literally a decade at this point and started my own company and have never needed to use the words "tech, technology, techy or science" ever in my entire life unless I was criticizing some pseudo science youtube engineer whos closest experience to engineering was sitting in a cafe across from someone doing actual engineering on a laptop
---
Well if it's any comfort, it's worth more in standard than in league. However not many of us tend to play in the leagues so even with infinite wealth it wouln't mean much to us. That said, you can still sell it in NL then use NL as your build testing grounds. Other than PoB that is. 
---
I believe mirror is like 200 exalts or so in standard these days, but i'm not 100% sure. Used to be 120 exalts, but prices keeps going up esp in standard. 
---
Gz on the find tho :)
---
subscribe, see if you get an invite.      
---
short answer: it's too late for this one, but not for the next 2 - if you are lucky and get an invite:
---
Points are points loser. Not going to dig 10 years ago to prove me wrong? Go ahead and just tell me what you think is stopping you from lvling efficiently as a rogue or warrior? There will be loads of people on this sub ready to prove you wrong.  
---
Just because you say someone never played vanilla dosent make it true. That's your only defense, and you cant even prove it. Its pretty obvious you never played, when you simply use "u never played early vanilla" as the only defense.
---
Nope. Don't want a beta invite. Been loving Deep Rock Galactic and I think it's still on sale for a couple more days. Easily put 15 hours into it and it just doesn't get boring. Highly recommend.
---
True, but it's not as cool as a bunch of stats :'(
---
Baseline insane skills
---
He doesn't care people are using his content to make money, since he would be a hypocrit then. So he would just come off as a dick for claimin videos. Honastly is nice to someone not try to abuse a busted system for once.
---
I mean this is from the perspective of this PvP video. Is enhance weaker at 1.12? yeah. But is an enhance shaman with HWL gear and hammer of rag going to be laughably bad in BGs? Nah man. 
---
We're skipping all the hard work that gets to this point, just talking about ideal set up, BiS situation. And the fact is, at those top-tier points (like in this video) nothing is really laughably bad. Top gear carries so hard in vanilla. 
---
My mantra for vanilla wow is to play what works until you can gear yourself up to play what you want.
---
I’m mixing my time between classic and my xbox 360.
---
Its 2005 again
---
How is correcting misconceptions and drowning out the false-alert REEEEEEs raining on the parade of people excited for classic?
---
Those people were wrong. That has nothing to do with excitement for classic.
---
You mean the expansion where they introduced flying mounts, loot hallway-style dungeons as the standard, introduced resilience into PvP, removed attunements, introduced daily ~~chores~~ quests as a synthetic time sink, gave horde paladins and alliance shamans, and just basically set WoW up to become what retail eventually became?  _That_ expansion?
---
1. There's usually some of the quests that are race-locked. The tauren quest to cleanse the water wells comes to mind, and that's a pretty long chain that's tauren-only. The 2h mace from the venture-co quest in Mulgore is only equippable by taurens also. There's probably similar restrictions in some of the other starting zones.
---
2. Someone already answered.
---
3. There's plenty of other places to get BiS gear, especially for casters, and for neck/ring/trinkets as well. Dungeons, quests and professions can all provide some BiS for some classes.
---
4. From what I understand, resistance and the level are two separate things. You need a certain hit% (16-17% for lvl 63/bosses IIRC) depending on the target's level and then resistances come into play, which can further reduce your chances of hitting. Warlock curses and talents can help counter that. There is no holy resistance, which means that holy spells get to skip the second part above and only have to worry about the hit%.
---
Doubling down on what u/Eskablade replied to you, it's not so black and white. *This* is a bug, though there could be many ways that layering just fucks you over, or gets exploited. Whether it's being used intentionally as a benefit, or if it's unintentionally negative, there *are* implications to layering. And Blizz understands that it's not in the spirit of Classic, since they want it to be short lived. I just hope it really is 1-2 weeks *tops*, but that really seems unlikely.
---
Classic Winds did a small comparison between beta and pservers. It was noted that beta has higher damage dealing mobs overall compared to pservers.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtR0fT3Hz3M&amp;t=2s
---
For reference. Take it with a grain of salt as there was no comparison with elites, dungeons, or raids.
---
Do we keep characters from first stress test?
---
McConnel proves how much he sucks.  I find it hilarious he was graveyard camping while dominating the match (intentionally not flag capping) and said how his opponents were bitches...he faces Venruki and when he starts to lose he AFKs.
---
Right. I don't hate layering as a whole... I just hate that we went from, oh, lets just shard the starting bit to help the gameplay and population... to layer the whole damn 1-60 experience.
---
I'm a Vanilla noob, how is AV going to work in classic? Are we going to get this 20+ hours AVs?
---
https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=394
---
This is timestamped right at the relevant sentence, watch for 30 seconds.
---
Yeah we used this for maybe the first month or two of raiding before it was patched out
---
That would be.. you know... a change...
---
Ehhh i took them for a long time.  I always had fine hand tremors.  I’m a surgeon so it was pretty prohibitive.
---
The very one.
---
Faces will be melted when you play shadow priest.
---
My favorite was dual Knightly Longswords with fiery enchant. I felt like a goddamn champ.
---
No normal revive turns me off them :/
---
They would never force people into TBC. That would really piss alot of people off, and even make some unsub. I want TBC, but thats extreme. Maybe if they designate some fresh servers as "TBC Rollover" that will eventually go TBC after 2 years or so, that'd be okay. But theres 0% chance they force people into TBC.
---
Ha, yeah, I am sure people on RP servers would like it. I just don't think it is really feasible when you consider all the mailboxes in the world, and then the portable ones engineers could create after WotlK (?).
---
But it would be cool for immersion purposes.
---
Yeah at that point it’s just inconvenience, not “no changes”. There’s nothing a slow mail system does that is vital to the integrity of a game.
---
Probably same with guild banks.
---
So you guys haven’t heard of Crack?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMhsZ0xxcZE0rzbto
---
Awesome work thank you!
---
It will just mean more Warriors/Mages/Rogues because raids will need fewer healers.
---
I started playing near the tail end of vanilla. TBC was announced sometime when I was leveling to give a little more context. So while I did play vanilla, I more consider TBC and WotLK my original WoW experience. I ended up raiding kinda hard core, but in vanilla didn't end up doing like aq40/naxx untill well after the fact.
---
Yep. They schooled me hard as I grew. TBC launched before I was really raid ready. They were east coast and I was in California so I ended up being an occasional filler for their guild or when they'd run T4-5 pugs before resets. They took me through Illy and TK, though I never had any loot priority.
---
The guild eventually splintered, but I had learned enough to start raid-leading my own crew through Kara and Gruul. Even touched T5 content before my guild succumbed to its own drama.
---
After that I picked up a buddy to 2-man old world content, PvP, RP, and generally goof off (kiting Anachronos to Ogrimmar)
---
With WotLK, I rolled a DK and started running with my brother again, pushing the 25-man raids. Didn't do much  beyond Naxx.
---
Check out [Vanilla Friends](https://www.vanillafriends.com)
---
I would love classic gameplay with 8.2 models and graphics. For godsake, I can’t handle Sylvanas as a night elf, not to mention whatever the hell is going on with goblins. Plus it’d be nice for people like Tyrande, Nathanos, Baine, etc to have their custom models.
---
As a BiS enhancement shammy on Pserver. That gear is kinda bad for PvP. Either go full AP / Melee crit or full Spell Damage. Going halfway for both does nothing but get you killed more. In the High Warlord gear you get mediocre hits that rarely Crit, and you just run around praying that you don't get kited by a huntard or 2 shotted by a mage. It's fun and hilarious when you do get that WF crit combo though. Elemental is the way to go, especially in Naxx and AQ gear.
---
Akfing would remove you, but the group didn't have a way to remove afk people until TBC. You could just use something to keep you from going afk and there was nothing anyone could do about it.
---
Oh yeah they were haha. Like I said probably frustration more than anything, I wasn’t too upset about being kicked. I came to them and was the best geared hunter in the guild.
---
The only thing that might stop you is having to buy the game + the latest exac + potentially the annual pass.
---
If you bought the base game and expac now, you could definitely get through the campaign before the last season drops next week.
---
Then if you got the annual pass, you'd get Power Surge bounties that take maybe an hour each and will give you a full set of 690 gear (all of us will be at 700 and the cap will be 750).
---
By August, you could definitely have accomplished all the raids. There's a huge Discord that people are constantly looking for more people for everything. Raids are anywhere from 20 minutes to a couple hours. You won't have every single item obviously, but you'll feel pretty damn powerful with what you do have.
---
Besides the "I want to collect EVERYTHING", Destiny 2 really isn't about the loot. There's no BIS to grind, the perks on your armor and weapons are random and while some are better than others, they don't massively change the nature of the game.
---
My suggestion would be to buy the base game, play through the original campaign, do some matchmade PVE content and some PVP (everyone is the same level in 99% of the PVP).
---
If you like it, grab Forsaken and unlock the rest of it before the patch drops. The patch is a reset to equal playing field for just about everything, so you won't feel behind by more than a day, maybe a week at most.
---
Let me know if you get it, I'll run through whatever with you and explain all the lore.
---
But he can because he is some cool hipster guy who can program!
---
Edit: he is just a Trump loving troll, you can disregard him.
---
HOW IS THIS NOT FLAGGED AS LOW EFFORT?
---
arena/rbgs
---
Aw man I'm in a cycle of house building and getting bored with this game.
---
Giggity
---
My first MMO. I was a mere child but remember it all too well. My father and uncle's actually played that one hard. their old guild (clan?) was Fists of Tyr. Awesome game. Hoping Unchained does well
---
This isn't new. This was back in vanilla if you weren't the right spec you weren't getting in the raid. It just depends on the guild you join. And this whole no one will notice is bullshit, there are some key obvious abilities that are missing if you don't go optimal.
---
Yeah it’s a nice bonus that still keeps them unique with BRez. Stuff like that I fully think should be included.
---
"I was fine raiding up until AQ" is a straight up lie.
---
With your hybrid spec you were clearing Molten Core when it became so easy that even the most casual of guilds started running it.
---
You never made it past Vael in BWL and if you somehow did you got super carried by people who greatly outgeared you and actualy played good talent specs. The second real obstacle in BWL without good healing was Chromaggus and then Nefarian.
---
What actual progressing guilds did was already checking healing and DPS logs in MC and weeding out slackers and those not willing to change specs.
---
I was an arcane power fire mage spamming arcane missiles and some frostbolts on trash packs in MC and it took us forever to just get to Lucifron.
---
When they called me and a few other DPS (as well as healers because a shaman was outhealing priests at the start) out on it and we actualy started playing the optimal way it all came together.
---
Hybrid specs work with amazing gear (which is obtained by progressing far and fast) or in super casual environment where it doesn't really matter to people if you clear a raid in one night or not. 
---
Please stop spreading lies about these things- it is one of the main reasons why people asked for dual specs way back in vanilla already. It was hard on healers and tanks to grind consumables for raids and they were forced to role a DPS class alt to make those things possible.
---
hit 60 a few days before TBC launched
---
Interviewing people is a 30 minute gauntlet of generalizations
---
The entire world of business is based on generalizations
---
Until this is fixed, stop brushing it off as "it's beta." It's not fixed, it's a major issue. It needs to be constantly brought up until it is fixed. Every time you guys brush this off as "it's beta" makes it seem like it's not big deal and it will surely be addressed. There is no guarantee this is going to be fixed.
---
This post has convinced me the damage values of elites is correct. This is exactly why the #NoChanges argument was always so silly, 1.12 is designed based off Naxx/AQ being the only current content for the majority of players and balanced around the gear from those raids. 
---
Without a rebalance, we will end up with something that feels nothing like Vanilla did.
---
I remember my dumbass bought a normal axe from the weapon merchant in Stormwind so I could get the enchant on it.. I might have been lvl 30 and so very much stupid. I can’t tell you how I was able to afford that since that was my first toon.
---
That's sort of my plan, burn myself out on nostalgia and then go back to regular life
---
Nah you definitely need practise as a hunter.  Kiting is an easy skill to get started but hard to master
---
Try not to ruin your life with this game like we did in middle school
---
Here's a [priest](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/AsxABMng_AQDPMg4) looking to join your group.
---
If i were you id try all the classes and level them a bit (i assume u playing retail aka bfa) to see what u like for classic release because when you play that it will be alot harder and slower than what you’re experiencing now, do some dungeons and pvp and then chill for a bit and just explore the game while you wait for classic and completely give up your life.
---
You want to experience classic? You will experience classic. This is 100% classic. Classic is an easy game. Grindy and time consuming, but easy. All the neckbeards remembering classic as being a hard and challenging game were 12 at the time and have a warped perception of the game difficulty. Retail raid bosses, for example, have way harder and more complicated mechanics than vanilla ever had. If you want to play a challenging classic game you should look for private servers, where they overtune the shit out of everything.
---
After 2-3 years, people that want to stay frozen in Vanilla will definitely be a minority. History will repeat itself. Yes, they'll be a few loud angry people, but Blizzard will see it as good business.
---
Tagging myself here for later.. running a small friends and friends of friends EU horde classic community, these are juicy for it ^^ looks good!
---
While I agree with your sentiment, Attunement was very much a thing, you had to have rep with each faction in order to do the heroic version of the dungeon, and there was attunement quests for kara and the eye, as well as others.
---
weird, I haven't had any issues
---
The trick is to get to 8 and then kill a bunch of mobs without looting them so you get 2 to drop.
---
Changes were inevitable. They were going to try new things, can’t say TBC paved the path for today’s WoW.
---
Vanilla stealth wasn't full on invisibility like it is in retail, and stealth while leveling is really weak.  And you should always be approaching from a mob or player's back.  What camo does is able you to get into position faster, and get openers on people you would otherwise be too slow to get.  Think of the stereotypical mage jumping around spamming arcane explosion.  With camo, you can get him in between his gcd.  Without MoD, most people will probably hear the "whoosh" but by then they've already been opened on.  And nothing will save you against a human with perception on except gtfo'ing, which camo helps you do as well.
---
&gt;People were actually pretty fucking pissed off after the first month or so that AV would last an entire weekend.
---
Who actually cares if some AV goes longer - join another one. Problem solved. There are plenty of AV instances, especially if they are going to have cross realm queues. If waiting 15 minutes for a Deserter debuff is too much, maybe this isn't the game those people want anyway. Not a whole lot in WoW is  meant to take under 15 minutes.
---
The problem is that Blizzard has made changes like this to the game to appease the vocal whiners, who just whine until they get what they wanted and then quit the game anyway, because it was never the game they wanted in the first place.
---
90% of the population would go to BC and the Vanilla servers would be ghost towns
---
"this tank sucks"
---
"f this I'm out lol newb tank"
---
Joke was on him, we finished with four people no sweat.
---
Red Dead Redemption 2 is on sale right now so that's a great way to pass the time til classic is out.
---
ah yes that went all the way to tbc as far as I can remember. hahaha
---
Oh my god that’s Jason Bourne...
---
That's what downranking is for.
---
&gt; No it doesn't. You can change any time it just costs you.
---
So then you can't change anytime because you won't always be able to afford the cost.
---
I mean, maybe, but there's no chance you'd know that for sure because to know that would mean you had to experience the an entire worlds worth of business, which is impossible for any human being... 
---
Didn't you just say you were a programmer? Now you are a expert in economics and business?
---
Please, would you let us know what it's like to be omniscient?
---
More xp that way. It’s better for you
---
I didn't know you could use you hand to jerk off for a long time so I would hump the couch. yeah the couch. I didn't know how to find porn so I would put on I think it was called real sex on HBO and hump the shit out of the couch.

my parents walked in one time, the most embarrassing moment ever.
---
I did the same. it's actually fun trying to beat your best time.
---
Don't people use GPU passthrough for playing video games natively on linux these days? I thought the days of dual booting and wine were over for you guys
---
I love that this guy is in beta and didn't even bother to submit a bug report...
---
Not being saved to specific raid IDs. I love pugging.
---
Why even comment if you don't know what you're talking about?
---
You actually just said BC removed attunements when BC had harder and more complex attunements.
---
Meh..what moron bought the Sprite?
---
As an Enhance player, it's just fun seeing someone randomly get deleted from a proc. But yeah, Ele is a lot more consistent with the burst and is still fun but that's the beauty of Shaman, all of their specs are enjoyable to play.

My friend played the beta stresstest on Linux with no issues. I'm guessing just doing what you do to play WoW on Linux would work just fine.
---
50,000 others are too! 😂🙏🏼  But nah, I made my own little server to just mess around on to test stats, crits, and everything possible for classes I want to play in vanilla.
---
I'm leveling a warrior. It's a class I never play so there's some new mechanics while tanking. It's been pretty fun so far. I load up the stress test client everyday tho to a no servers found error. feelsbadman
---
Mounts didn't change until 1.12.1, they were the Classic way in 1.12.0.
---
What you're comparing are big decisions that benefit everyone in the world versus a tiny cosmetic decision that affect a minority of players that will hit 60 and be able to buy a mount before BWL hits.
---
No thanks.
---
I want an actual beta invite, not just these server errors and queues for 2hrs events

---
Right. Phase one could be months. A massive amount of people are going to have their whole 1-60 experience involving layers.
---
Please do! These would be great for a LFG/LFR addon. ;-)
---
No, this was on Earthen Ring.
---
It MuSt Be BuGgEd!!
---
My guild and I were attacking Onyxia still looking for our first kill. We were approaching the kill, and people were dropping like flies. I though that any shot we had I needed to pick up aggro which was never hard for me, I popped my Adrenaline Rush and started evasion.  I sat there for the longest twenty seconds of my life hoping to live. I fucked up, a tank was alive still so was our top healer. I held my vanish, going for the damage. I died, we wiped. I learned that day that a rouge should never die.  Rogues are the "oh shit" tanks.
---
You just reminded me there was this lvl 43 Troll player during vanilla in my guild named Bludragon. He spent 100% of his play time fishing in the oasis in the barrens talking in guild chat and drinking beer. He was an older guy and his son was an undead warlock a little bit younger than me.  
---
I'll never forget both of those guys and I hope they've been doing well.
---
Yeah same thing with druid changing in and out of different forms, kind of annoying.
---
As far as tips/advice. Just be prepared mentally. WoW takes more time than other games (the grind) and there's a lot to learn. It's a big game.
---
more specific advice: rebind turn keys (a+d) to strafe keys, try to get used to keybinds for spells (it might take awhile but its better in the end). I wouldn't start with a lot of addons but consider getting questie.
---
If I wasn’t so excited for a fun classic this would give me joy, but it’s going to ruin the game. The raids need to be retuned or people are going to clear MC on their first run with 30 people in the raid.
---
I thought they said it would be removed after Phase 1 is over? I assume Phase 1 will be the longest, because people are still leveling, and will be significantly longer than a few days or weeks.
---
Fun Fact: Staff of Jordan is actually the BIS for 2h windfury as a 39 twink. It's slower than Fiery War Axe and has the same DPS.
---
This doesn't count as being "shown wrong," but some of the Nostalrius team went to meet Blzizard and talk about classic servers in 2016, and they say in the post about it [here](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=44218#p308858):
---
&gt;However, in order to generate the server (and the client), a complex build system is being used. It is not just about generating the “WoW.exe” and “Server.exe” files. The build process takes data, models, maps, etc. created by Blizzard and also generates client and server specific files. The client only has the information it needs and the server only has the information that it needs.
---
&gt;This means that before re-launching vanilla realms, all of the data needed for the build processes has to be gathered in one place with the code. Not all of this information was under a version control system. **In the end, whichever of these parts were lost at any point, they will have to be recreated**: this is likely to take a lot of resources through a long development process.
---
Seems to confirm that some stuff was actually lost and they had to re-make it, so chances are there would be a mistake somewhere in that. Not sure what they actually lost though, the post doesn't say.
---
I believe they said they would removed layering at the end of Phase 1 which I assume would be a couple months? Correct me if I'm wrong
---
That would be a very long read even as just a synopsis.
---
I hated Jailbreak so much, but not sure if that was from doing it so many times helping guild members get their Onyxia key.
---
You can actually get to the tauren starting area in 12 minutes from the orc/troll starting area. Probs a minute more if you bother to take the ratchet FP which I didn't do.
---
You can take the secret path in the valley of trials, jump down and be within right next to Ratchet. From there, just walk to the xroads, grab the FP, run to Camp Taurajo, grab the FP, and then run all the way to Camp Narache.
---
I suicided and spirit ressed @ water--&gt;Ratchet, Road of Glory--&gt;Taurajo and Gnoll Camp--&gt;res over the wall in Camp Narache, making sure to unequip my weapons so that only the spirit ressing would damage them.
---
Its funny how the term tank is now pretty common throughout gaming, but i had never even heard it before i started playing WoW
---
Definitely dual spec. Guild banks can't be done from multiple level 1 bank toons.
---
Not that I'm aware of. Would love to know myself.
---
Lol not rly man. If u stopped playing during t4 for 6 months, you come back and continue with t4. you may fall behind your raid team but you can just continue where you left off -- it was just a different style of progression. As opposed to today (I stopped playing after I beat the first troll raid (idr the name) in bfa on mythic) if I were to come back I'd be able to step into the next raid bc I had bis and titanforges. But if I only played at a heroic level, then that wouldn't be the case (maybe I'm geared enough for the faceroll shit show that is lfr, but that's another problem for another comment). There was no ap grind back in the day to catch up on at all, so no that isn't inherently wrong. The fact there is even a necklace to catch up on kind of proves my point...
---
 It's not so much that there are catch up mechanics, but that they make the past raid tier totally irrelevant. In the past, you would still need to gear thru t4 to reach t5, not just skip t4 and t5 completely to reach t6 because now the normal dungeons that you did to get geared for the first tier drop better loot than that original tier (talk about immersion breaking). 
---
And ik they changed the raid system to get more ppl to see the content. But nonetheless there's less immersion bc ur progressing thru raid difficulty levels not progressing through raid to raid. Rather than gearing past one raid and being able to start a totally different raid, you just get to re do it in a harder way. That's my point -- nothing to do with how easy it is. Just simply less fun -- in my opinion -- to go from normal to heroic to mythic. If you enjoy that style better then that's great and I'm happy you do lol. I don't agree with it and I'm happy there will be an option for both types of players once classic is launched.
---
Also in Warcraft 3 they were unarmored (i.e. cloth), so they shouldn't be wearing leather/mail, but for WoW they probably had to add some class to compete with hunters for mail armor.
---
&gt; -PvE gear useless in PvP
---
I remember they had to specifically patch that out of arenas because of how OP PVE resist gear was. They patched it so you can't change gear in arena late TBC.
---
was the couch hot tho
---
Now would be the time to do those runs. Fresh server. I plan on leveling professions and taking my time and around 50 start doing those dungeons runs non stop for the pieces.
---
Felix’s Tools -Beginning starting area for the dwarfs/gnomes
---
Hopefully sharding/layering will help this or there will be 100+ people standing around trying to loot this shit when classic releases. May the fastest clicker win.
---
Mix of holy paladin on alliance and leveling priest being boring as shit
---
His laziness puts me off. Hes banking off this shit but he can't even be bothered to fucking care about his own content enough to do anything other than press record and scream about things, letting others do literally all the other work.
---
Warning: you may experience fun.
---
Basically the only thing in common is the UI.
---
I found him funny, honest. And he know the game dann well.
---
What do you mean by obnoxious ?
---
It would be really dumb if layering was a thing for months.
---
I run a software business 
---
Learn programming -&gt; Make software -&gt; Sell Software-&gt; Hire people to maintain software
---
That is the natural progression of programming you weren't aware
---
vanish isn't that important during a fight, it's used as a cc breaker
---
but please play gnome and have fun being worthless, dwarf is the only good race for rogues in pvp
---
I used AIM to talk to IRL friends, just don't think it was on my desktop. MSN was for internet friends.
---
He was 30/21 spec, for the first half.
---
it was a group on Habbo Hotel
---
The attack!
---
Hunter or Rogue i feel fits.
---
Streamers won't have any issues getting into raids as Enhance because people will carry them for free. On the bright side, maybe all of these streamers playing Enhance will help the non-streamer Enhance players get into raids.
---
so my wow account is from 2006 and I have lots of other paid blizz games, they don't do it based on date right? it's just random unless you're a streamer that will make blizz money right
---
I started late and dinged 60 a couple weeks prior to TBC. I really can't wait to get to explore it all again for the first time.
---
There’s a XP theme for Windows 10 you can download that will make your desktop, start menu, and programs all look like you were running XP. Highly recommend
---
That’d actually be kinda fun. “This week I’ll do resto and heal raids.” 
---
“This week I’ll be ele and dps.” 
---
A week-two week long cool down and dual spec with no gold cost would still keep the vanilla “you are this spec, it’s identifiable to your character” vibe, but still allowing people to be flexible every now and then.
---
I never got behind the portal but I did explore the empty space behind deathnell, inside the dalaran bubble and karazhan crypts. I didn't know there was a space behind the portal.
---
Quite the opposite. I literally cannot get off Persona 5 right now. It's scary.
---
I remember doing a 13 Mage 2 Priest AB premade, I stopped after four hours of nothing but wins, was a lot of fun
---
If your parade is a false sense of difficulty then sorry bud, dungeons were never hard.
---
Shockadin can take down any class.
---
ehh. it was pretty old and stained up, and not just from me. 
---
like coffee stains and all that
---
Lesson: play The Lost Vikings from 1992. Quell that classic itch!
---
You'd be a fire mage with fear in PvP, so not 100% useless.
---
^^just ^^maybe ^^... ^^like ^^95% ^^useless
---
There's too much even for a synopsis. You're almost better off just treating classic as an entirely different game that you'll have to learn from scratch, because it really is. 
---
Only themes in classes really remain, and even then that's a very loose interpretation. (No holy power on Paladins, shaman totems drastically different, no solar/lunar bar, hunters use mana not focus etc. Etc.)
---
why not? assuming a st build, you don't start getting payed off with frost bolt until points in shatter which start at lvl 25. And fireball always ranks up 2 levels before frostbolt. 
---
Example: A mage who ranks fireball at lvl 12 is going to have a dpm of 1.06 and dps of 27.8, while a pure frost bolt mage's dpm is 0.94 and dps of 18.6.
---
Not possible. Even if we assume horde make up 60% of the entire population that means that almost 50% of the horde will be shamans.
---
Nothing noob about fiery.  It's dynamite.
---
OLD AV SUCKED.
---
People say it was great and epic and all that shit but it was horrible and completely pointless.
---
You would go in on tuesday, play for 3 hours and not move from the central field of the map for a single minute then log off and come back the next day either on the same spot or one graveyard lower/higher.
---
It was bad for melee classes playing solo and ranged DPS with aoe spells were doing only that.
---
What happened later was great and it didn't take away from the game at all. People just didn't defend bases like they never do in RBG so it became a race to whichever side could get most players to the enemy base the fastest and kill the faction leader.
---
Bruh for real?? I was in Grove Street during wrath as a mage! Cool bit of info haha
---
Wipes in dungeons were caused by 3 things primarily.
---
First would be mobs/bosses that Fear.
---
Second would be Patrolling packs.
---
Third would be your healer pulling aggro on bigger packs.
---
BE HAPPY YOU GOT A BETA CODE
---
The world of roguecraft videos where he just keeps downgrading all his gear until he's fully naked. The people he kills while completely without gear... let's just say keyboard turning wasn't their biggest problem.
---
IDK honestly. My account is probably from then as well, and I played through the end of Wrath.
---
Where do we sign up?
---
25% more shamans than warriors, not 25% total shamans.
---
oohhh Paladin taunt... I could play a prot pally and be taken seriously. 10/10 would love that.
---
Wow.. RIP.
---
Work smart, not hard. He doesn't *need* to make his own youtube content, hell he doesn't even need to pay the creators of the videos. I'm fairly confident his lax attitude means those youtube highlight streams can monetise his content without fear of a DMCA though so it works out for them too really.
---
Yep - I played as a Rogue and had 5 points in both Lightning Reflexes and in MOD (cause who doesn't like sneaky stealthing) which meant I didn't have my damage completely twinked out. Nobody ever really complained I wasn't doing that extra few points a second.
---
Find a guild that doesn't force you to take the cookie cutter spec and just have fun.
---
26 hour events, but yeah.  I want invite too.
---
People just don't realize how shitty they used to be at video games lol
---
You just wrote a list of all the things that happen with any mmo.
---
Probably not.
---
Can’t wait to afk inside the ah and miss the buff then cry
---
I read the other day that it took 10 secs to spawn on the beta and that pservers had it wrong.
---
Lifestealing was my favorite!
---
I actually loved it as it basically "forced" me to kill more, which was good for me!
---
especially around 45~
---
it had just started around that time.
---
I think DKP hoarding is another issue alone guilds need to get a handle on. But even in BWL it’s totally okay to have gear from 5/10 mans and quests as long as they are BIS. So there’s basically no reason not to min max pre raid bis because everything can be farmed. (Maybe not epics from dungeons tho)
---
There were a lot of addon options for that in vanilla. It just takes people willing to put in the time to update them to be compatible.
---
Asmon doesn't care about them being monetized lol. I'm fairly sure he's mentioned it before, it's not like he loses revenue for it since he doesn't have official highlight videos.
---
Yeah, that sounds great but seems like they didn't exactly double down and changed it when shown with proof.
---
I cannot believe this comment has a negative score, lmao. The ad is ABSOLUTELY creepy and sexist. It's literally implying that you grope her in the ad.
---
Starcraft,  halo, warcraft.. best games
---
The killer of everyone.
---
It was the only NPC to pass Defias Trapper in player kills.
---
I don't know... after leveling my priest back in the day, when I leveled up my druid it was a bit comforting that everybody had to run back after a 5-man wipe, and not just me.
---
Get rekt alliance scum!
---
Those damage value differences are insignificant.
---
As far as I’m aware, only Catdany actually has Asmon’s permission to upload his content. Either way though I only watch Catdany highlights, they’re always the best put together
---
One of us! One of us!
---
Does First Aid count toward your cap of 2 professions?
---
Happened at least once on Skywall. We had a 36 hour av once, was great.
---
This guy fishes
---
Of course they don't - PRAISE SIGMAR
---
Honestly, I have no desire to be in the beta.  
---
I absolutely want to play live, and would be thrilled if they announced it was launching tomorrow...but I don't want the stuff I do to be reset.
---
I'll get my fix when it comes out : )
---
I wonder if they will prevent Horde from getting the Paladin set pieces and vice-versa for Shaman/Alliance.
---
This wasn't patched 'til several months into the game.
---
I'll probably play the new ffxiv expac while I wait.
---
As far as I'm aware that is the case. And yes I agree, it is dumb
---
What was Halo Zero?
---
Yes, it was.
---
Exactly. Being unbalanced is actually a good thing in some games
---
Making virtual bank
---
I just bought a new graphics card, installed WoW (BfA), played around with the graphics settings for 30 minutes to make sure things were smooth, felt good about being ready for classic, then proceeded to uninstall WoW again. I only want classic.
---
At the end of a dungeon especially in the higher levels people definitely expect a portal for free.
---
But by then 18s is nothing to a mage so I never have an issue making a portal.
---
The thing is people are catastrophizing this and implying that this is how layering is going to work, when it's not.  Obviously it needs to be fixed
---
Having fun? I wish I could be in the beta.
---
Or before getting hit by a 150 dmg auto attack and laugh
---
Hunter have a much higher theoretical uptime on the debuff thanks to wingclip proccing it.
---
Somebody needs to test this.
---
&gt; There's not much you can do with no money or gear. Do you just transition into gold grinding for gear at mobs below your level?
---
Fedex quests can give some good money tho. At level 4, Bitter Rivals gives almost 2 silver. At 6-8, Crown of the Earth gives a ton.
---
I finish at level 10 with enough silver to level up all my pertinent skills, and buy a bunch of mail vendor armor to fill out all my empty / broken spots, and a bag or two.
---
I start the 12+ leveling portion in a very well geared, fully equipped place.
---
&gt;Do you have any community for speedrunning (or at least just leveling)? I haven't been able to find much.
---
Joana's World on Discord. I don't have a link, sorry. Also barrens.chat has a fairly active speedrunning thread.
---
It's an MMO RPG. RPG is right there in the name.  Ultimately there's nothing they can do to stop you from deleting a character and creating a new one with the same name, but it's not something you \*should\* be doing, and it's certainly not something that should be made significantly easier.
---
They also come out slower which makes sense considering yeah, they *are* better. To be totally honest though it's generally the react videos I watch. He usually gives an actual opinion on the content he's watching rather than just letting it play out with little to no input like a lot of react channels tend to.
---
I've found a bunch of new youtube subs with those videos too, MadSeason being the best one probably.
---
BC and WOTLK are my favorites. I will pay good money to enjoy BC again. It looks like they will be going this route as well if classic is as much of a hit as people think it will be.
---
&gt;Reason is a lot of people go in thinking “ima tank” and the warrior ends up being REALLY painful to level compared to other classes
---
None of the 1-55 dungeons needed Protection spec to tank anyway.
---
Leveling as Prot Spec is a lesson in suffering.
---
Anything below Mythic+ raids in BfA is way easier than vanilla content.
---
Also, the topic was not difficulty, it was how good or bad dungeons are. There is not a single dungeon or raid in BfA that is as GOOD as Blackrock Depths, Scholomance, Stratholme, UBRS... I could go on. Vanilla dungeons beat BfA content easily.
---
Classic launching with 1.12 talents is already a change, the Beta has made it clear that this change is impactful enough that a buff is probably going to be necessary.
---
 This is a wow board my friend, trump doesn't have much to do with it. But yeah, can't tell if this guy is trolling or just stupid
---
I gave everyone in the raid a stack of water, only to be traded back a note that read, 
---
"EAT SHIT AND KILL YOURSELF
---
SIGNED,
---
EVERYONE"
---
Probably because he was using a better melee class
---
Why did you buy a new graphics card for a 15 year old game?
---
Ah misinterpreted your English. Have a good day
---
retail wow players will hate the idea of a 'hybrid spec'. It goes against all min/max theorycrafting that everyone cares about these days.
---
Same. Same.
---
Might not be the most popular answer but has worked for me is giving myself a very difficult goal (reach Masters rank) in a game I struggle to enjoy now (LoL) to challenge me until classic releases. It is actually helping me keep interest in League and my mind off WoW, and hey, even if I don't reach my goal, I'm rewarded with Classic at failure.
---
I urge many of you to try this in any game you liked or loved and avoid pservers/beta.
---
i was gonna say boomy with hand of rag, but you actually want to be good. shockadin &gt; feral &gt; ret

Undead rogue.

Stealth is huge for skipping past things other than fishing...especially when you can just hide underwater for a long time to escape danger or just for a break.
---
Its an act. I used to think he was a tool untill i started watching his stream. Now i get it and i think hes pretty funny.
---
Its commonly used to rank characters in fighting games at least
---
That is true.
---
Every game I play is tasteless. Like the ash a Vampire tastes when they eat normal food.
---
Bringing a more diverse class distribution means your raid gets geared faster, which means that it will be outdpsing a raid full of Warriors/Mages/Rogues in a few resets.

I'd be against this.

Won’t be like this with layering.

Basically already in the game. Nothing additional is needed.

Water totem / water form

Druid. Isn’t there a swimmer or something? You’ll need it to get that awesome fishing pole off the coast of Desolace.
---
Thats why i loved being a herbalism/alchemy druid as my first ever character. I could make all sort of potions, strength buff? sure! Health increase, sweet! Invisibility potion, hell yeah!  Or just quick stuff to sell. Saved me/party countless times and it was (to me) a naturally easy profession that you dont mind doing because it doesnt seem time consuming/annoyingwmats/costly kinda like enchanting/engineering
---
No, it wasn't. Very few private servers actually buff the content, and it's usually exclusively for raids. Such as WOTLK's Naxx. They announce and state these things too, nobody is purposefully buffing level 30 dungeons.
---
As someone who helps maintain a popular WoW private server and contributes to WoW emulation, TrinityCore and Mangos I can say with 100% accuracy that this is an unintended consequence of incomplete emulation. Mostly attributed to incorrect data, as some data used for emulation of 1.12.1 is derived from packet captures from TBC, Wotlk and even Cata.
---
Totally against this.
---
missing steam and cs 1.6 ;(
---
My first toon was a male orc rogue, enchanting and... fuck, idr the other prof.
---
I remember finding out that crusader recipe dropped from SM mobs. Farmed the shit out of them until I finally got it.
---
Was able to finally advertise a desirable enchant. Felt good.
---
Sad news. I like having to pay a little bit of attention during low level dungeons so knowing the content is generally drastically easier than what I've experienced on private servers is a bummer. Holding out hope that higher level content has some small degree of challenge to keep me engaged.
---
I'd support this.
---
Embrace the game and the class.
---
My number one tip would be don't worry about what other people say.  
---
It's a huge game with all kinds of possibility, so just explore, try everything, and latch on to the parts you like.  Even if you want to min/max, follow guides and all that, it'll still be useful having experience with different talent builds and playstyles.
---
old wow is top tier escapism, especially combined with the nostalgia so many people have for it.
---
I wonder if people are going to die at their chairs going for rank 14...
---
orc is better, undead looks cooler
---
I think it was also around Zul'Farrak. You can't really survive that place without the tank leading the party, until that point dungeons had been pretty easy but in ZF you had to call which mobs get CC'd, which ones you'll aggro, and so on.
---
I'd support keeping this.
---
I'm on the fence, but I think ultimately I'd be against it.
---
LWoW is more addictive than any drug I've tried tbh. Maybe weed is close though
---
I hated treeform. It felt like it made healing even more punishing. But I'd be happy to be in the minority on that one.

Resilience killed the fun in pvp. In tbc it was “use the pvp set or die”. The great thing about vanilla was the possibility to use the same set both for pvp and pve (of course it wasn’t optimal but it was surely fun).
---
Biometrics is the “clean” answer.
---
Requirements for playing WoW are already far more expensive than a simple fingerprint scanner. (Available for less than $20 on Amazon). Simply make a fingerprint a requirement for BG’s:
---
Step one: Throw in “two-part authentication” via an authentication key sent to a verified mobile device, and a fingerprint scan.
---
Step two: Create a requirement for your “two-part authentication” every time a player queues for a BG and you’re g2g. No more account sharing to grind r14 - at least not in BG’s anyway.
---
I'm sorry if I missed it, but what part of the video am I supposed to watch?

It's not that bad, right? You just need to collect 15 badges... from a bunch of densely packed elites, half of which are stealthed. The badges have around a 10% drop rate. They are not shared between party members. And you don't even get a decent reward at the end.
---
Its only saving grace is that there's no particular reason to do it.
---
I highly suggest not trying heroin. That definitely is more addictive
---
But that's *so sensible!*
---
I dunno, it always seemed easy to find world pvp in vanilla. Either hunting in black rock mountain or STV (when ZG was released) was always action packed for me. It did drop compared to pre bgs but not to the point where you couldn’t consistently find world pvp. Oh and Silithus when AQ was being released was some of the most fun world pvp.
---
You just made my decision easy. 
---
Rolling druid!
---
So many to choose from but from a personal standpoint, dual spec. Even if you stay with the same role the talent tree differences can be insanely different between your PvE and PvP spec. Paying 50g each time you want to switch is a huge pain in the ass; especially if you’re not able to spend lots of time farming gold. 
---
Even if there were restrictions for where and how often you could switch, I think it would be a welcomed addition for a lot of people. 
---
Like I said there are so many choice but the runner up for me would probably have to be adjustable difficulties for dungeons and raids. Perhaps something like the Ulduar hard modes where you had to do something special to make a fight harder (instead of just toggling a setting). But instead of getting heroic gear with better stats, your raid just gets an extra piece of loot or two, more gold, mats or whatever. Being able to run hard modes of lower level dungeons would be sweet too.
---
What is this TBC you speak of?
---
I'd like to see a Kara Crypt raid that is 10 or 20 man and goes along with Naxx.
---
And asmons fanclub
---
We had a shaman main tank AND main heal up to about 40. Mage and Hunter cc with Hunter/lock pet offtanking any cc break or extras.
---
How does removing content benefit the community?
---
You changed my mind on this!
---
DM is Deadmines, DM E/N/W is Dire Maul. It's reasonably straightforward.

Love that!

&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | NA-PVP | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Wed or Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore
---
Introduction: 
---
&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other’s company, and found communist memes amusing. 
---
Raid Schedule:
---
We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST and will pick between Tues, Wed, and Thurs when it becomes more relevant. We will use loot council made up of a mix of officers and a weekly rotation of raiders with a focus on gearing tanks and healers first. 
---
Player Expectations: 
---
We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That being said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables and arrive on time. As we only will raid six hours a week, we need to be efficient. Players should also aim for at least 80%+ attendance.
---
As we will also wish to continue clearing the raids after MC, the number of players using meme specs will be capped and approved on a case-by-case basis only after you have shown that you are willing to go the extra mile that is needed to perform.
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game. 
---
On Culture:
---
&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren’t tolerated. You don’t need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can’t keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit. 
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel

Yep, nice, you summed up the entirety of business on Earth in this many words:
---
&gt;I run a software business 
---
&gt;​
---
&gt;Learn programming -&gt; Make software -&gt; Sell Software-&gt; Hire people to maintain software
---
&gt;That is the natural progression of programming you weren't aware
---
Again, let us know about that omniscience thing , I'm truly interested to talk to the only entity to know everything and experience everything ! Especially everything about business :)
---
Oh yeah, heroin is definitely on the "never" list for me
---
Horde scum.

The fact resto Druids don’t have a shapeshifter form feels really weird. I don’t like that they removed it later either.
---
Ah, so I was right about the secret club thing. Got it.
---
Got a war going on in Eve Online right now, but it scratches a different kind of itch. But even it has gotten stagnant a bit for me. Least I get to play some in the stress test tomorrow.
---
Hunter. Feed fish to your pet
---
What about the other two?
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
You're like the first person to mention that, and it's starting to make me wonder if I'm remembering tbc and not vanilla...sunder was like 3rd priority behind shield slam and revenge.
---
I loaded win10 as soon as it was available at work, holy shit what a mistake. Begging my team to push it back as late as possible for their own sake
---
Coming from EQ, I knew what tanking was. I however played with two friends (we're all coming back for Classic!) who didn't know what the hell I was talking about. It was an amusing first week that involved lots of phone calls and walking through the Warrior talents one by one.
---
It all seemed to click at the end of a week - yes, you need good armor and a shield. No, you don't need those big numbers from crits. No, you don't need to just turtle - but you need to generate threat. Yes, that priest dude with us will heal you. 
---
15 years later, he's playing a Warrior tank again as he loves it now.
---
Feral isn’t really a meme spec. Balance in anything except pvp is maybe, but feral isn’t terrible.
---
gtfo
---
LFR, DUNGEON FINDER, FLYING MOUNTS, TRANSMOG, TRANSGENDER, TITANFORGING, PANDAS, HEIRLOOMS.
---
But Seriously, shut the fuck up.
---
&gt; You actually just said BC removed attunements when BC had harder and more complex attunements.
---
I'll take patches 2.1 (removed SSC attunement), 2.3 (lowered Heroic dungeon reputation requirements) and 2.4 (overall terrible patch that added Isle of Daily Grinds) for $250, Alex. TBC is the first expansion I would genuinely want changes for. Some vanilla things like cross-realm BGs, AV changes, and such I'm on the fence about, but TBC introduced many things that in hindsight were mistakes and took away from the game's magic. /u/Hexxys named several of these and is completely right.
---
So yeah, either give me TBC without flying mounts, daily grind, exclusive focus on maxlevel gear grind gameplay, wannabe esports PvP, irrelevant old world content and all the other downsides of TBC, or don't give it to me all. We've already been down that road once and it leads to BfA. I loved TBC and I've played it (on private servers) more than I have vanilla, but I've come to realise it just isn't what I *really* love about WoW.
---
All this goes doubly for WotLK, which people undoubtedly would be clamoring for if they did make TBC Classic. Hard pass on that unless they change it up a lot.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Then there's the problem that releasing TBC and/or WotLK would splinter the communities massively and frankly I don't think it would even be commercially viable unless Classic *vastly* exceeds everyone's expectations.
---
Shroud been playing it too
---
^^^^^^^^^^ not just her but seeing people that have never played or had a sub irks the fuck out of me.
---
Dude, I was in Omertá for a time. Do you remember Lard of Crossroads mailbox fame?
---
there is nothing meme about ret or feral for pvp
---
it is a little bit for pve
---
but for pvp those specs work just fine
---
Just curious, but why? It doesn't seem like it would affect others so you wouldn't have any harm in using it or not
---
Still show that they dont get it right most of the time, even if the difference is small. This obviously implies that most of pserver content has to be taken with a grain of salt
---
That title just reminds me of those sonic memes XD
---
No changes is retarded anyway and just shouts down anyone who has a different opinion
---
Downvoted for watching assmon
---
The helm is so good damn
---
Fucking zhevra hooves. There are 4 on each animal, why do I have to kill 30 to get 10?
---
Kara attunement was nerfed in a patch so that only one person in the raid needed the key. SSC attunement was entirely removed early on. Heroic rep requirements were lowered in a patch.
---
 Sure what do you want to know
---
The delay will be in classic because they said it encourages interactions such as not waiting an hour to make your new gear.
---
The only things still in the game are quick mail to yourself and you can mail multiple items to yourself.
---
He's right though. Most of the time in the beta streams they run dungeons while being over-geared or over-leveled compared to what the average joe will be. And for those who properly find gear upgrades and dont start doing them while too underleveled will be able to manage them. Theres nothing wrong with this but its pretty stupid to say they are a "walk in the park" as a general statement. Its all relative to the players preperation. We will 100% see tons of people showing up at the recommended levels undergeared and take a beating
---
Duel spec, the crafting bank thing to hold all of my mats, and stacking mats to 200.
---
A good hunter would have Engineering for those goblin resurrector items, and resurrect their rezzers after a wipe. Then, your raid will love you.
---
When i did a poll, i had it use roles as well as class, and it showed about 2/3 of warrs want to roll tank
---
Everything, since you know everything :)
---
I remember being a priest and healing quite a few shaman Wailing Cavern tanks.
---
If you're just here to troll please leave. unarmored mounts were in vanilla for months before being removed. And if you're gonna use that boring logic why should naxxramas be in the classic version? You seriously believe more than 1% will ever enter that place and do a single boss? Please...
---
T1 and especially T2 were amazing for most classes. They may not look impressive on their own but it’s all relative. At the time most people didn’t have any epics except a pvp epic item or two. My hunter in full T1 could destroy people with a multi shot crit. 2.2k crits when most classes in decent gear ran around with less than 4K HP. In full T2 I could kill non raiding warriors and many bad raid gear warriors in melee without ever using a ranged skill.
---
My brother liked making twink rogues back in vanilla and my warlock was a tailor/enchanter that was high enough level to farm elemental fires in un'goro and the lowest SM dungeon for the small brilliant shards.  At the time we shared an account since we were both still in middle/high school, so when it was his turn to play he would farm the materials and enchant his new twink's weapons with fiery.
---
The measly profits from farming/enchanting Fiery, minor beastslaying and riding skill distracted me from leveling so bad that I never hit 60 in vanilla; but I had the money for my epic mount when I finally got there!
---
Why’d you wait so long
---
&gt;They changed the way combat worked at some point to prevent rezing during a fight. People feign death on private servers to dodge a death but I'm starting to wonder if that will even be possible?
---
No, you can do that in real vanilla and classic too, you use a macro that Feign Deaths and uses the rezzer cables at the same time. FD puts you out of combat so you can combat-res.
---
This will 100% be possible in Classic.
---
I feel like people should be saying this about all classes. 
---
"X is good, but with a pocket healer does even better."
---
Basically this entire sub
---
The only femorc I can think of was literacola
---
How do you figure you will get your hands on OEM products?  I didnt glance at anything but this specifically and it tells me a lot about the post.  As a system admin Im almost worried to look at the rest of the build
---
those people are also doing 3x the dps the raids were tuned around.
---
Ok kind of badass lol
---
Not gonna lie I was completely unaware of this. Thanks OP.
---
Just reroll lol
---
The only way to not splinter the community even more is classic expac, not TBC a whole new route. And you don't opt in or out
---
Not only they are at level 30, but they are BiS levels 30! Your average Joe from Classic after release won't have all-blue high-stats gear farmed for dozens and even hundreds of hours on a "level 30 cap".
---
People who obsess that much over DPS honestly aren't really "getting" the game, because not every classes role is DPS. Hunter is definitely not a DPS class but a utility class, they do a ton of useful things in addition to tranq.
---
DPS players just often have a very one track mind.
---
A resto shaman without mana tide would have deeply upset my raid leader and our priests, haha.
---
Never forget that if it wasn't for the no changes primates shouting down people we might have gotten an actual revamped classic wow that had the same feel we all want and less of the cruft and warts. 
---
Down with #NoChanges!
---
I can tell already that you didn't play then.  Also it's obvious you didn't read what I wrote.
---
Sounds good buttttttt it’s going to be hard to green light anything if it’s not 99.9999999% classic at launch.
---
Are you sure? I was under the impression it put you in combat if anybody was attacking a boss in the same raid zone.
---
keku
---
Ahh yeah I forgot about Pendulum, although it is absolutely arguable which is better. Pendulum only has 7 more top end whereas Jordan has higher DPS, more useful stats, and spell damage. It's a trade off really.
---
Tip though: you don't have to be super toxic when you correct someone :)
---
literally the best animations in the entire game are all on undead female.
---
Part of the art of twinking is getting what you need before you out level the bracket.
---
Why is bashing trump the “cool” thing to do anymore? I thought it was pretty cool when I voted for him over the lady who let people die and deleted her emails. Oh well.
---
huntard (leveling, farming, early game pvp insane), rogue (big raid dps, ganking)
---
I'd do hunter, rogue has a fair bit of frustration imo and just takes way more effort to level.
---
shaman is also kinda braindead. raiding is super easy and ele you just spam purge and one shot ppl
---
I think you're likely to get better responses at /r/buildapc.
---
[This is a pretty good read](https://www.logicalincrements.com/games/wow) since as far as we can tell, Classic has near identical system requirements and performance to Retail.
---
Don't pay anywhere near $50 for windows on eBay, go for the $5 or less ones. I build a lot of systems and use them all the time, never had an issue with updates or deactivating down the road.
---
That's wrong. Something seems off and I played in Vanilla.

This is absolutely a fair assessment. I shared acc with both my old man and brother. I did raid a lot in my fathers stead because he could get busy with late night phone calls or toilet breaks for long durations. Basically did start up to Hakkar in ZG for him multiple times and I knew what items he needed to roll on. Happened in UBRS sometimes too
---
That's the real PvPer mentality right there.
---
If you're going to keep posting "PLZ Blizzard" suggestions after Blizzard has specifically and adamantly said no, please leave.
---
I think a large reason for some people preferring to play UD over Orc is you have a lot more trouble against classes that can fear, and using a trinket slot for your PvP trinket is such a "waste" compared to all the other good trinkets out there (im talking reflectors, nets, rentaki, absorbs, six demon bag, shrink ray, DMC, tidal charm etc.)   
---
All of that next to the fact that you can use a LAP to remove stuns, but i cant recall any consumes to remove fear.
---
True. I am mostly No Changes myself. But this feature seems to me like something, that only promotes even more Vanilla content. It's not really changing the game or making it easier. Seems to only provide more of what Classic already provides. Not sure about any downsides yet.
---
Why not both? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I'm a wrath baby but "played" TBC which was just playing in my cousin's PC for like an hour and doing as many free trials as I could

Did we just get defeated? Was Mr "you think you do..." right? With everything being lulez mode, will classic be worth it?
---
Frostmane used to be such an amazing server. I played Flamingtable the Human Warrior there. Still do except I'm Mag'har orc now.
---
Custom games are still alive. I'm using it to pass the time. Tree tag in particular... Even a discord and games every day.
---
Please correct me if I am wrong but in vanilla you had no xp gain in battlegrounds?
---
Husband and basically everyone I know played in vanilla. I used to watch, but I refused to get "sucked in" until late TBC. Closest I've ever been was legacy servers. Still can't wait for classic, and haven't seen my husband so excited about WoW in years.
---
This is how I do it. Works great.
---
I'm playing PS, for pretty much the first time..trying not to grind too hard while also learning as much as I can in preparation. Don't wanna burn myself out tho but I'm stoked for classic
---
Experiance management is what makes twinkling hard.
---
What quests to do/not do. What areas to explore/not explore. Ect.
---
Personally I felt it was a mistake when they allowed you to lock the xp bar, took all the challenge out of twinking.
---
Actually... no.  Thanks to the amount of banter about Final Fantasy XIV on, of all places, a Blizzard site, I decided to fire it back up and give it a try.  I've had to pace myself with it a bit because I've been having a lot of fun with it.  Early going is a little slower than expected because I accidentally picked a tanking class while trying to get melee DPS, but if I want to, I can just swap classes now that I've hit level 10 with the first class, and don't lose progress between classes.  (Not that I'd necessarily want that in WoW, which has things covered pretty well these days with swapping specs in a class.)
---
The thing that has me most excited to dig into is their version of professions, which are classes of their own, meaning I have to level them, but can have any of them and swap between them.  Very useful if I want to go level up being a Miner, then later Blacksmith and Armorer in order to make gear for my character.  What remains to be seen is if the gear I make will be relevant.  That's one thing I hate in modern WoW that I look forward to in classic WoW.  I love the idea of being able to make stuff for my adventurer to use.
---
The graphics in FFXIV have also drawn me in.  I've seen some nice MMOs (like Black Desert Online), but FFXIV is insane.  It makes me imagine what it'd look like if Blizzard did a newer WoW but using similar graphics, where the game would look closer to the cinematics.  Sure, it wouldn't be able to run on older computers, but I think WoW only sticks with the art style that works on older computers because it was developed starting two decades ago and released 15 years ago, and trying to completely revamp its graphics would be a nightmare and not worth the effort (especially as they're just fine for what it is).
---
I also feel a slight pull toward playing some more Saints Row 3, because sometimes I just want to cause mayhem and blow stuff in a fun environment, and a game where you airdrop into a penthouse to crash a party with guns while Kanye West's "Power" is playing in the background is the perfect game to scratch that itch.
---
I've got other games calling to me, but too many to really dive into.  Maybe if I hadn't gotten into another MMO, I'd have time to do that.  D'oh.  (I should probably finish Witcher 3 at some point, especially since I picked up the first Witcher novel over the weekend for just over $2.  A local store with used books, movie, games, etc. had an awesome Memorial Day weekend sale, so I picked up a bunch of stuff.  One of the things being a book of basically essays about WoW titled, amusingly enough, "The Battle For Azeroth.")
---
Hey, it might not be the answer you were hoping for, but I wanted to answer honestly!  If it helps, I have been checking out a lot of WoW Classic streams, either on the side while playing modern WoW, or using the Twitched app on my Roku to watch while chilling with my cats.
---
Maybe you're right. I am not sure if people actually enjoy this part of twinking, but well, that's why I made this post.
---
I'm actually bored of the Beta. There is really nothing to do at 30. I got decent Gear and enough Gold and I don't want to level up more Classes because that would just spoil my fun in Release.
---
It's a flat additive resist chance, bringing up Orc resist chance to 30%.
---
Female dwarf with the hair that twirls around when you cast. No fucking brainer.
---
\&gt;implying that these 'adults' got around to growing up
---
Dumb question, but Frostmane’s Swifty isn’t THE Swifty, is he? Different people?
---
I always unbind keyboard turns for strafe, and turn my S into something other than backpeddle. If I need to reposition as a tank or max range something I’ll use the arrow key.
---
You have very different PvP rankings from what is commonly considered the best.  Ele Sham? It's awful.
---
Warrior and Hunter in B tier? They are easily S tier in PvP.
---
Easier respeccing. Not completely free and open, but not nearly as long and expensive as classic.
---
I wonder how many of us are doing exactly that lol getting real fomo. I hope the hype is still there in August.
---
I would have fucking killed for 3mbps back then.  Hell, i think i was on that well into the 2010s.  Downloading patches when i started in '09 kind of sucked.
---
Why did you get downvoted so much? Man this sub has been flooded with Current WoW players and it's awful now.
---
Well what you'd do is basically swap the shaman in the healer group to drop mana tide, and once it finished, bring him back to the melee group. Just need a raid leader or assist to click drag.
---
The XP issue can arise, when you are running dungeons for gear, for example.
---
Better models/rigs/textures. There's zero reason not to have a toggle for everyone so #nochanges can play whine their eyes bleed and the rest of us can use the better models
---
Are you just speculating or have you got a source for that? While I don’t feel your to far off I don’t totally agree with your points. I would be surprised if they don’t up the level cap to at least 40. Or artificially boost the testers level to something higher to test certain content they think they have issues with. The closed beta ending after the last stress test is possible but I feel It’ll be active a little while longer than the 19th, maybe a week or two longer. I don’t think there will be any open beta whatsoever. The best we could hope for is that after the final stress test they leave the servers active for longer than a day and let the people that have been invited keep playing for an “extended stress test”
---
The changes in 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 were all made to make outdated content more accessible for alts and casual players, yes. 
---
His comment however makes no mention of the great attunement chains that DID exist in burning crusade. It reads like somebody implying that they simply weren't in the expansion.
---
TBC had a lot of issues, however attunements being removed in later patches was not one of them. Nor was shamans and paladins no longer being faction exclusives.
---
Yeah that's a reason I would like them, I'm really wanting to go for '100% completion' in classic this time around, all quests, all reps(as much as possible, i know some conflict), all bosses, etc. That's why my suggestion was a 'low level quest tracker'
---
I assumed so as well, but it would be nice to get a confirmation from someone that has tested it out in the beta. The wording of the racial as actually kind of vague. What makes you so sure by the way?
---
Let's put it this way.  For a while now, I've ripped private servers for being a face roll easy mode.  They were inaccurate.  But it turns out they were over-tuned in-accurate.  Oh, the irony - the joke is on me.
---
If this remains going into end game, it's going to be more brain dead than LFR.  Everyone will be an end game raider up till Naxx.
---
1.12 ..... hahaha.  comedy gold.
---
I don't hate the idea, although I could see an increase in twinks discouraging the late newcomers when they jump into their first BG and get stomped, scaring them away from BGs altogether while leveling.
---
Remember that chip they implanted back when you signed up for WoW the first time? Yeah, they're activating it.
---
People actually leveling toons (alts and mains) ran plenty of dungeons and queued BGs in Vanilla.

Was also free for people through today.  Just the base game, but still, load that up with MCCC, Wicked Whims, Extreme Violence, and Basemental, and you have a ridiculously amusing sandbox to play with.
---
&gt; What makes you so sure by the way?
---
Because we tested it.
---
I wonder how many people are working on the catdany/assertonsin videos and how much money they get from asmon. Im really curious.
---
&gt; Bringing a more diverse class distribution means your raid gets geared faster
---
No it doesn't.  All casters are competing for essentially the same gear, same as melee DPS.  The big advantage Warriors/Mages/Rogues have is that they scale really well with gear.  Less viable specs like Boomkin, Ele Sham, Ret, etc don't have that luxury and their tier sets are healing focused.  You're better off giving Warriors/Mages/Rogues gear priority if you are pushing progression.  
---
What this ultimately means is that guilds who bring less viable specs have higher ceilings for how far they progress.
---
Sadly yes I agree. The classic DB is woefully lacking right now.
---
You were essentially a waste of your guilds time haha.  This highlights why raids WILL be easier, everyone knowing what they are doing and able to do their job.  The old days we had 20 people carrying 20 others who were absentminded and ill prepared
---
Damned Devilsaur Mafia!

---
Damn it! Is that why I want to play horde but being drawn back to play alliance?
---
I see. What I saw in twinking personally, was more of a "different meta" of PVP. Or just the theorycrafting itself. But yeah, I guess you can see the leveling as an important part to it as well.

Games have been boring for the last year or two. I’ve been playing DotA 2 and Pokémon lately. Not the first choice when you have a $2k gaming Pc tower you built yourself but what else can I do..
---
Don’t have the beta but assuming it’s the same, I played an orc warlock in vanilla. It’s a flat 25%. 1/4 stuns will not land.
---
\^ This, and people actually leveling toons (alts and mains) ran plenty of dungeons and queued BGs in Vanilla.  
---
In the beta? If so, thanks for the clarification!
---
I can understand that. I spent so much time specing all 3 of my toons during vanilla. It took me a lot of time of farming to be able to do that.
---
Again bad. That was a long time ago lol.
---
The post would make no sense then. And you do choose, when you choose a faction. :D
---
The people saying MC cleared on release week sound incredibly optimistic to me. 
---
Realistically some classes including warriors won't hit 60 in under 5 days /played. You also need at least 24hrs sleep a week (3.5hrs/day). That in theory leaves a day to clear 9 bosses and a lot of slow to kill trash. 
---
None of the players have time to run 60 dungeons so they'll be trying this with lvl 5x greens and 4x blues.
---
Also factor in some potential server issues and week one bugs.
---
Mathematically it might be possible but I'd be genuinely surprised. 
---
My predictions:
---
MC and Ony week two clear. 
---
BWL week one. 
---
AQ40 week one. 
---
Naxx week two. (The tank poaching will happen before the instance is released.)
---
Be careful applying a rational framework to irrational opinions
---
1. The start areas are not race locked. BUT you won’t have access to your level 10 class quest as this is in your home start area. Also some areas won’t have your class trainer eg Teld has no paladin trainer. 
---
4. Holy can be resisted but most mobs don’t have holy resist so it’s pretty good at damage 👍
---
Sweet Christmas that burst damage was retarded. Made me want to roll shaman for a second there
---
This right here.
---
\-Deep Ocean, Vast Sea all time worst  
---
\-The Arathi Highlands Pirate Cove Quests; Specifically, being tasked with looting underwater objects and having the Naga net you underwater.   
---
\-RFK Tubers quest; Just in general how so few people knew how it worked, and how much time it added to the run  
---
\-The Alliance escort quest in Feralas to ring the bell at the Night Elf female. Can be frustrating.
---
This ^^  in azshara it is soooo worth it to have water walking to fish
---
My fiancé was bitching about the fire totem quest for horde taking her back and forth from durotar to the barrens and back. Oh she’s in for a surprise.
---
That may be true, but on the other hand, after the Classic is live for a while, there will be very little players actually playing BGs at low levels, so it may as well become the problem of Twink infested BGs vs. No BGs at all. If we go into extremes.
---
Unfortunately because of the debuff limit you can't Mortal Strike in tryhard raids.
---
Your best bet would be to try and fill a 3rd tank role with a 32/5/14 spec to get Cruelty, Last stand and 1 point in Imp. Shield Block.    
---

Otherwise you are looking at 100g a week :(
---
Vanilla realms were capped at 3.5k. Layering is just to prevent those 3.5k people having to fight through everything in the starting zones on day one.
---
Yes.
---
Played vanilla on release for maybe a month. Never hit max level or raided, just messed around on a few alts.
---
I consider it a blessing because it right during was freshmen year of university.
---
Hoping to group up with others in a similar boat who never really player or are new. (US PVP west-coast)
---
The interface gives you a whole slew of options for combat text, you’ll need to go in and enable the heal ones
---
I give you props! You at least made your first choice correctly in the game. For the Horde!!
---
A colossal amount of DPS would be lost if a hunter was attacking bosses with Nightfall instead of shooting them from range though.
---
Heals didn’t show until TBC. You’re better off downloading a scrolling combat text addon that tells you how much you healed (and overhealed) for. MikScrollingCombat text is the most used, not sure if it’s been ported over to classic yet, but I’m sure it’ll be eventually.
---
Bag management with the filtering and the ability to ignore bags for sorting.

Some of us enthusiasts are still here. 👍
---
Just wrote this comment to break trough 666
---
Preach ran it at 23 and it was pretty easy (the only speed bump they hit was him getting the -100 defense curse and having to slow down to 1-2 mobs at a time till it fell off), until they hit Arugal and he murdered them in about 20 seconds. And almost wiped them the 2nd try as well.
---
unlike a lot of the other streamers, he was taking his time to just run content for fun and wasn't really bothering with twinking out, the party he was running with was similarly leveled and geared.
---
But he was also pro-tanking everything...so it was a smooth run regardless.
---
You are *not* going to see realm populations anywhere close to that high. They’ve said they want blizzlike populations which as already commented were around 3.5k.
---
Will do! I’ll send this account a PM on Thursday if I don’t hear anything, hopefully we can bring back something great!
---
Lol have you tried not being a dick when correcting people?
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1422 is the poll
---
We really don't know how raiding will look yet, it's possible the 1-30 dungeons are a breeze but the later ones ramp up in difficulty.
---
Too lazy to twitch, but so entrenched that most of my turns goes into games. It’s a battle.
---
You should use wowpedia.org not wowwiki
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft_API
---
There is also a own category with classic specific functions
---
Cant wait to test this! Oh wait.
---
Yea, he is also crushing on keyboard turning people in greens.
---
Just dualbox, and it wont be hard to gear your twink with the help of your main.
---
Temporarily stopping your XP gain would not destroy this part, I think. As you can just not use it, if you want slowly progress with your group and do BG's along the way.
---
So there’s 3 roles , warrior, mage, priest 
---
Fill the raid with those and you’ll be fine
---
Yet there are people who are completely fine and collect it. The world may never know.
---
Regicide.
---
The shouldn't just layer you right away upon accepting the group invite. It should require you to perform a ritual like hearthstone that teleports you to the nearest inn in the new layer.
---
Anyone who thinks BFA’s story is as bad as its class design has no earthly clue what bad writing actually looks like. It’s not even the worst story WoW’s ever told by a mile lol.
---
Awesome! Would you be able to add '' [https://discord.gg/aAHcKDq](https://discord.gg/aAHcKDq) Classic Twinking Discord '' ( We are on This Subreddits Wiki ) Also I made a 19's ''For Dummies Guide'' [https://xpoff.com/threads/classic-19s-for-dummies-guide.88554/](https://xpoff.com/threads/classic-19s-for-dummies-guide.88554/)  /  [https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1443](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1443)  if you think that is worthy of being on there ofc :) But def think the discord should be ;)
---
such a shame, I remember when I played with him and he died shortly after this video came out.  Kinetic was never the same.
---
Hooookay listen the f*ck up.
---
Warrior and Hunter can be good in certain situations. Warrior + HPally is literally the combo to run. But Warrior vs Spriest? And undergeared spriest can fucking steamroll a decently geared warrior just because of the mechanics of the fight. 
---
Hunters can be mean as shit ( I plan on rolling one atm ) but a warrior that pops a FAP will beat you. A mage that doesn't die in the opener will beat you. A warlock will beat you. 
---
As for Ele Sham. Just you wait. Ele Shams with gear are POM/PYRO mages that heal on a 1.5m CD instead of 3. They are nutty
---
you will be downvoted, but not because what you say is true and that it hurts, but because it's false and just more shitposting.
---
Wait.. is this /r/wow... now I'm really tripping.
---
Addon can do this...
---
lol fair enough. so 3 warriors, 4 priests and 33 mages with no melee? got it
---
Sort of. I pulled this from an old thread:
---
&gt;	Nost content difficulty was tuned towards retail values. However to compensate, gear/other items were patched onwards from Patch 1.4. Limiting itemization/enchant/buff options for tanks, DPS, and healers, allowing for a more identical experience to original Vanilla. Bosses like Broodlord, Chromaggus and Nefarian had the capability of killing your Main Tank within 1-2 seconds due to unusual damage output, seemingly **stealthily buffed**. Making it a fair challenge in progression with un-defcapped tanks. Invis pots to skip trash was not possible due to dragonkins detecting stealth.
---
&gt;	Overall, with the success of Nost - it’s popularity being my main metric for this - I think a lot of people got spoiled by the Patch 1.4 style release - artificially **boosting content difficulty** instead of a direct, feenix-like, HP/dmg boost. Has the vanilla private scene moved on from the traditional 1.12 itemization environment and moved towards a pre1.12 emulation style? Why do people continue to defend unbuffed BWL/AQ releases in a 1.12.1 item emulation when it has been proved possible to do?
---
You can see that the added difficulty contributed a lot to the player experience and success of the server. This is where, imo, Classic is currently missing the mark.
---
Not a quest, but Blizzard put the Lightforge gauntlets at about 8% drop on the Emperor in BRD, a zone where **no other** Tier 0 rare set pieces drop- on the last boss of an instance the size of Mall of America. Fuck that.
---
Noooo you have warrior for dps as well
---
I mean... " Just dualbox" doesn't sound very... Money friendly. Among other things. Well, also an option I guess.
---
Sang’thraze and Jang’thraze. Made the unfortunate mistake of accidentally combining them on my fury warrior.... arms was always better dps anyway
---
in 1.12 this shit was all nerfed. It wasn't this easy in 2004
---
you won't need to man just invite other people make friends classic as all about the journey you won't be alone find a healer and add them to the friends list
---
&gt; With everything being lulez mode, will classic be worth it?
---
Dungeons were always pretty easy, at least until TBC introduced heroics.
---
But you'll find plenty of challenge in PvP and taking on raids while undergeared.
---
In any case, I'm in it for the community and gameplay that isn't *constant* procs and timers and flashing lights.
---
This is incorrect, each layer has been confirmed to take a full server's worth of players. Layering is intended to overpopulate servers to accomodate for the anticipated "tourist" population, who are exprcted to quit en-mass within a month or two.
---
Big Druid eat little rogue

Do you know of a good bis list for hunters I hit 30 2days ago and not sure what all I need
---
Mind sending me the specs?
---
you're only allowed one view on this subreddit:    
---
"Classic WoW is great and retail WoW is shit"
---
Yup. The #nochanges has slowly changed into "I want this in classic" and "This should be okay" and all of the comments are supporting it. Sigh.
---
Then again they are doing it in the beta. Cleaving down dungeons with whirlwind axe
---
I'm playing with two friends who are playing Warrior and Pally to my Rogue. I'm going to tell them this :)

The problem with guild banks being tied to an account is the lack of access.
---
Hooray!
---
Do you have that list of what every class learns at each level?
---
I first played WoW in 2006 on my friends account, I got a Warrior to about 30, but I had Dial-Up so I could never download the patches, ultimately forcing me to play other games. I ended up taking my computer to a friends house and buying and installing the game on his SUPER fast 50KBps(!!!) internet and was able to play a few months of Vanilla before TBC came out.
---
I didn't get high speed internet until like 2012 since I always lived in rural areas, I missed out on so much because of it, but I still managed to do raids and stuff at my friends house. The most I could do on dial up was 5 mans, couldn't do BGs lol
---
&gt; Yeah at that point it’s just inconvenience
---
I'm inclined to agree.  But to be fair, a lot of things that made vanilla what it is could be called "just inconvenience" by some people.
---
Nope that just means layering has to stay in for longer lol...
---
Just use /world.
---
Also, I'm sure someone will make an addon for this.
---
it is the most practical solution though
---
For one the big bounce theory is far superior to the big bang theory

The entirety of existence of a recycling bounce of black hole collapses

Spoiler alert: You two were raid-mates, back in the day.
---
Well I modt be the wierd one :(
---
Except vanilla was always easy, kiddies were just bad at it.
---
Yes. I just got Final Fantasy X HD and played a few hours before getting bored and going back to Reddit or private servers. I'm too hyped! 😭
---
What's scary is to think about what blizzard decides to do when servers dont fall that much and they have 12k people per server... welcome to Classic!*
---
*layering is a permanent feature ;)

Racials aside, Undead have the best animations of all classes with female undead having the BiS animations.

* 150 +healing

Not that much.

Saving this for later

---
Mage- you can see some good damage without massively great gear, and you bring AoE utility, intellect buff, food/water, decurse/CS and portals home and since you’re not melee, unless you’re AoEing you don’t need much healer attention, though you are super squishy.
---
Does it replace the mouse or the keyboard? Honestly it looks worse than a conventional mouse+keyboard setup.
---
A potential solution would be to apply the deserter debuff if you don't enter the BG after your queue popped if you are queuing as a group.
---
Although the deserter debuff might be shorter than a drawn out WSG between evenly matched premades.
---
Layering will be around forever.  Think about it.  3 months in there is 10k players on a server, you think they can get rid of layers?  Of course not.  They rebranding sharding and layering, and they will rebrand it again as some new tech that will allow "layers to be disabled around world bosses", while the rest of the world continues to have them.
---
Its either that or they and hoping the game dies and they don't need layers anymore.
---
In Ontario Canada minimum wage went from 6$ in 2004 to 14$ now.
---
Yakuza kiwami 2 is pretty good
---
Every 5 man wipe I’ve done in vanilla everyone runs back anyway.
---
and once they have an idea of the staying power THEN they'll considering make new servers and offering free transfers from the most overloaded servers.
---
layers are just their first line of defense against the Tourist populations. Once they have a better idea what they're dealing with they can use their other tools to start parring things down in time for phase 2.
---
They just don't want to make more servers than are strictly nessecary for the populations again.
---
Found the tech nerd.
---
I would love it to be an epic mount level investment (1000g) to open up a second tree.
---
You still have to go to the trainer to swap between them, and if you wanted to change them it would still be a 50g cost.
---
That works. 4 shadow mages for every off spec tank. The shadow healing would be insane.
---
Ok, grandma. Lol
---
Wtf is a shadow mage 😂
---
Dungeon mobs do significantly more damage on Pservers compared to beta, this is not really a debate.
---
you are clearly trolling lol
---
Shaman. Whatever race you like the fishing animation of.
---
Dual spec would break the game but slight (significant would also break game) decrease to respec would be nice.
---
I used to heal and back in the day one issue I had a lot was tanks just taunting to tank and nothing else. Now I finally know why they would do that, thanks
---
honestly same, I cannot wait for TBC
---
I wish people wouldn't down vote just because they don't like the content of the post. If it is relevant to the conversation just skip over it.
---
Crusader dropped in the live side of stratholme, though they are the same “scarlet” mobs.
---
Based on who you ask it’s pretty much been that way for a while even in overtuned pserver scenarios. Warrior tanks are the go to, wherein they build into fury focused on big damage and threat generation. Which basically creates the cycle of:
---
Tanks DPS their balls off without a shield to keep the boss looking at them -&gt; Healers keep the tanks up by basically spamming heals -&gt; DPS burns boss as fast as possible so the healers don’t have to worry about OOMing before the tank dies since they’re spamming
---
It’s basically a convoluted way of saying your raid comp is essentially 8-10 healers and 30-32 DPS, two of which just happen to be able to hold good threat.
---
As with any old, dismistified game, Classic will be played by... *speedrunning everything into oblivion.*
---
It's what some people do to make an old favorite game fun again. This, or new game+, but WoW lacks this option.
---
People can even create addons to make an database of instance completion timers.
---
levelling is slower so far on classic though so rag/ony may last longer than on pservers
---
this is all minor gameplay changes. wow died the moment faction hate and uniqueness became meaningless. there is nothing whacker than alliance shamans or horde paladins.
---
2
---
Nice! I was long gone to other servers when TBC dropped.
---
Wait... you jumped the couch errr bareback?
---
It doesn't sound very practical to me. And on top of it, it promotes solo play. Why not go those dungeons with an actual group? Also - paying Blizzard double, just to be able to farm stuff faster... That's a bit strange.
---
Tanking wasn't a thing til at least ZF+ dungeons, if that. The earliest you need a real tank is probably ST and even then I'm not sure.
---
30%
---
There's always room for discussion. You're not here to discuss however since you're blatantly lying in your post.
---
I think so much stuff just gets lost on guild bank alts because access to them is terrible.
---
I would love to have a regular size bank that is free for anyone to access.
---
Classic release date was announced.
---
That means more interest.
---
That means that of course people that are from current release will be here.
---
So that leaves a few choices.
---
One of those choices is to whine and complain and say 'but this is my club!' while trying to be some kind of exclusive vanilla fanboy.  (I mean, the whole 'been on this sub since day one' is a total 'I liked it before it was popular so I'm cooler than you' type statement.)
---
Another choice is to share what you love and care about.  To explain why nochange matters and what it really means.  To help show why vanilla wow was so much fun and meant so much to us.  To speak up about the things we care about, rather than just whining and running away.
---
Then the community splinters off into the inevitable F R E S H tbc server that would 100% launch if Blizzard states no TBC. I for one would quit classic in a heart beat if I had Naxx on farm and they said no TBC, instead some random custom stuff.
---
it came out in patch 1.3, so none of it will be available in phase 1. Same for paladin. (they were added at the same time).
---
Now whether the shaman gets their version in phase 2 or phase 4 (the patch it was added)...we don't know yet.
---
So force everyone to play Classic+, brought to us by modern Blizzard, rather than give people the choice of BC. That seems like a very short sighted and selfish perspective
---
9 - for the longest time I played an Orc names Bluebabadee
---
No lies, just an opinion you disagree with.
---
Yeah I'm sure a mount farmer who knows the dungeon mechanics so well he lights all of the candles in BFD, has no concept of rage management, and can't pull only one pack of mobs to save his life is just so much more skilled than all those idiots who played EQ for years and then wrote dungeon guides on target priority and needing a mage to sheep for certain pulls because of high incoming damage.
---
I logged onto my shammy and got 2 hours of fun proc spam.
---
I thought the last thing you saw in vanilla was a mage spamming ice lance x2 and nuking you .. was that LK?
---
And not a bug was reported.
---
&gt; The LFG Tool, in its current Retail state, wouldn't fit into Classic - it's too handy. Maybe limit it to faction cities or rested areas only, obviously limit it to server (retail can group with people from any server), no teleporting to zones or players.
---
If this existed and only worked in cities, I'd still use an addon instead for helping to find groups.  I plan on being available to heal dungeons the entire time that I'm leveling, even if it's slow.

Warrior weapons master checking in
---
BFA is a game anyone can play and do good at. Classic wow is not.
---
Spriest is a God in 1v1 and 1v2, and brings nothing special to the table in group scenarios. No mobility, no burst, no real meaningful utility that can be used from shadowform. And yeah, going oom will be a huge issue.
---
You can square up and drop some people in side skirmishes in bgs but if you want something that does well in group play it's pretty low on the totem pole.
---
Explain to everyone here how unarmored mounts are a thing added to the game when it has been there from the start?
---
Anyone that told you Vanilla was more challenging wasn't accounting for a number of factors; but simply put, mechanically Vanilla was easy.  The challenges came from the character progression, the gear drop limits, the raid size (keeping 40 people online for a fight was a feat, let alone building a 40-man raid team).
---
Those community and personal development challenges still exist.
---
From Teldrassil to Ashenvale in a couple of hours?
---
Yep, definitely retail.
---
This comment was great. I read it while working and immediately wanted to start rethinking my build. I got home and spent a few hours just brainstorming and ugh it's so fun! Thank you for the input! It was helpful
---
Again he did nothing wrong. But the dozens of spam account fans he has are really old. Maybe you have poor reading comprehension?
---
&gt;I'd really like to play a Tauren without that vanilla head.
---
Interesting. I mained a Tauren during WotLK, tried playing one recently with the new models and I literally^figuratively puked.
---
It's not a problem for me if they include BFA models and graphics options for classic but I will be sad that other players will see my Tauren looking like *that*.
---

---
What? Like 90% of RPGs have S-E tiers for some aspects of the games mechanics, like damage scaling etc.
---
Someone asked him about that the other day. He estimated about $20k/month. I'm not privy to YouTube ad revenue, but that's what he reiterated his estimate of what they generated.
---
Reads cringe enough to be.
---
I like the silver lining but unfortunately this is not great for the game. 
---
One of the earlier pservers (K1) was presumably blizzlike and players constantly complained that it was too easy. Then Nost came along with a higher difficulty which contributed to the servers widespread popularity as a better emulation of the vanilla experience. 
---
Difficulty plays a big role in providing a sense of accomplishment, which is one of many things we miss about Vanilla. We all remember hogger, long nights in deadmines and scarlet monastery, but unfortunately same-level content will be a cakewalk in 2019.
---
I never said they were added to Vanilla. YOU said you want them added to Classic. They were not available in the patch we’re playing. They will not be available in Classic.
---
My version would be a long quest with 500-1000g  in consumables to unlock a second talent tab.
---
To swap between tabs you still have to go to an NPC, and each tab also has a cost to make changes to it.
---
A corollary would be the ACCEPT button so I can put point in and out like a calculator before I'm committed to a talent. Would also same miss clicks.
---
Hey there,
---
I'm from the Wowhead team, and a few days ago I made a post on the subreddit explaining how drops, locations etc rely on the Wowhead Client, which was only updated for beta a few days ago:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bslmrx/classic_wowhead_client_now_working_uploads_needed/
---
Here are some of the things which require the client in order to run:
---
* NPC locations and maps
---
* Droprates and item sources, including dungeon loot
---
* Vendor Costs and Sold By Tab
---
* Quest Progress and Completion Text
---
* Quest Start and Finish NPCs
---
* Translated NPCs and Quests
---
* Quest Maps and Objectives
---
* Ordered Quest Series
---
* Adding NPCs and Quests
---
* Quest Experience
---
* Objective Tracking on Zone Maps
---
This has only been running for a few days but we're getting lots of information in from the early zones. Not a ton from the level 20-30 range yet, which is why I made the post on the subreddit hoping to get more installs :)
---
If you have any examples of outdated comments you can report them as out of date on the page, or email feedback@wowhead.com. We imported all the vanilla comments from Thottbot and Allakhazam so those should be pretty antiquated.
---
The last one made me laugh.
---
dat bank alt doe
---
PRO TIP: The mail system is a nearly infinite storage system for 30c a stack of anything. Mail it to an alt; don't open it, and just return it when you need it on your main.
---
Even though I won’t even be playing Alliance, I would want Paladins to have taunt. I feel like it would open a lot of windows in the game.
---
You can clear your entire YouTube browsing history with just a few clicks btw.
---
&gt;They don't do anything particularly well in PvE aside from Tranq shots
---
They are literally the only class that can solo high level dungeons and bosses... That's pretty damn well for PvE.
---
Blizzard said each layer is a server cap, which should be 3.5k
---
¿Por que no los dos?
---
It was a way to keep people paying subscription fees without needing skill to advance in rank though.
---
Just added both.  Thanks for letting me know!
---
Wtf are you talking about
---
&gt;raid until T2, get the Rok bow
---
But Ashrje'tul crossbow from BWL, where you would also get your T2 from, is by far better than Rhok'delar. Significantly better. Rhok is only good for MC and even then, you could just keep Bloodseeker or the crossbow that drops in Stratholme all the way until you get Ashrje'tul. Rhok'delar is a very minor damage increase from those blue crossbows, considering how much trouble you have to go through to get Rhok.
---
It'll never be "necessary" to buff anything. Casual guilds will still find progress difficult enough and hardcore guilds will stomp every encounter even if they double the difficulty. These raids would need to be reworked at a fundamental level to meet modern standards; this is just the reality of vanilla raids, and why everyone tunnel-visioning endgame raiding like it's retail is a mistake
---
yup, abused that shit forever
---
Me not that kind of orc
---
Idk if its in classic.  But NEs can swim from menethil to a little spot that zones them in dun morogh then drown themselves and rez in the gy.
---
&gt; I think it would be pretty balanced, its just like World chat, but a little less spammy.
---
Already mentioned.
---
Not sure what you're referring to.  There are a couple individual resources for class skills, but their not for all classes, just the individual ones.  If you have a link, post it here and I'll add it.
---
I'll just take from this that you do not want "no-changes", you like that vanilla is being picked and chosen.
---
Also we are still not playing 1.12. If you keep repeating the same lie can you explain why Naxxramas is not active on release and subsequent questhubs that were there patch 1.11? You can't pick and choose what is right and wrong if you're gonna throw a blanket statement of why you must be correct.
---
Amen brother
---
Right. This has little to do with difficulty and a lot to do with us being ignorant of the content and craptastic at the game. Still should be fun though.
---
well no, it was it my pants.
---
I like all but 9
---
"It's cool that there's actual different builds with strengths and weaknesses."
---
One more facet of the perfect imperfection that was Vanilla WoW.
---
Thank you!
---
It's mostly because he's scum.
---
They had a solution back in 2005 with free transfers to lower pop realms.
---
How can you give priority to warriors mages and rogues when everything that drops is a hunter weapon
---
&gt; Viper Sting
---
Doesn't exist
---
&gt; so we need to round up to 693.
---
In other words, if you do the Cat's Eye Emerald quest, you're damn near guaranteed to get at least one Savory Deviate Delight recipe.
---
That quest sucks dick, but at least the grinding is good.
---
I've always picked 2 or 3. 4-6 too yellow, 7-9 too bluish.
---
Crusader recipe drops from the Scarlet Spellbinders and Scarlet Archmages in WPL/EPL
---
Righteous Orbs (needed for crusader) drop in live strat.
---
Yeah but there's no flavor to not being able to change. It's just "I can't change because this asshole wants a bunch of gold".
---
It’s impossible to simulate how bad people were, yes, but tuning content to be more difficult goes a long way in preserving the Vanilla experience. 
---
One of the earlier pservers (K1) was presumably blizzlike and players constantly complained that it was too easy. Then Nost came along with a higher difficulty which contributed to the servers widespread popularity as a better emulation of the vanilla experience.
---
First glance I saw the pills as a dildo
---
Gear distribution aside, Horde absolutely wants a Shaman in every group for totem buffs.
---
That's the main reason Horde suck. Their paladins have worse armor, no bubble, and their blessings are only party wide.
---
Oh, so he’s not real?
---
we're getting 1.12 gear and talents for content designed around 1.0
---
Time gating content that should be available in the patch is not the same as re-adding content that should not be available in the patch.
---
That's true.  I think that's what people were saying is that leveling is a lot slower.  We'll see.  
---
The leveling experience seems to be about what people remember.  The last time I leveld was pre 1.6.  So I don't know what the 1.12 experience is.  
---
But once people actually get into the raid ... it's going to be pretty funny.
---
Just want to say, thanks for preserving thottbot and for putting effort into classic.
---
&gt; If you have any examples of outdated comments you can report them as out of date on the page
---
I think the issue is more with comments that are too new rather than outdated.  (No need for 2.0+ comments on classic items on classic wowhead for example).
---
Barring that, I look forward to what you all are putting together, and hope more people in the beta start logging info for you for when I need it in the future : )
---
What are you talking about? No Hunter BiS gear gets nerfed in any of the later phases. In fact they just get more top tier gear, like the ZG trinket and Dire Maul stuff.
---
Hunters in the later phases of Classic will be far more powerful than in phase 1 and 2.
---
It’s common knowledge that it’s a flat 25% increase. You don’t need a beta for it.
---
you mean...low level dungeons...ARE EASY?
---
Clearly this is bugged, low level dungeons are supposed to be as hard as naxx, private servers say so!
---
You are assuming pre-bis mapped out now but 15 years ago.  If you are allowed to assume bis then everyone here is assumed to be pre raid bis.  Those, “not so important” stats could make the difference in 1 or 2 heals that keep up an essential player.  Im glad you wasted your time to add up those values though
---
&gt; and balanced around the gear from those raids.
---
uh
---
I don't think people in low level dungeons are going to have raid gear
---
as somebody who has a career in tech and science, that’s not true.
---
even if you up the HP/DMG, the strat doesn't change... it just means the healer will end the fight at 40% mana instead of 50% mana.
---
now, if blizz could add more abilities to all bosses, we'd be talking.
---
TBC servers already exist.
---
There is a splinter if blizz does what most people suggest. Which is concurrent TBC classic and retail servers.
---
Why would they split the player base 3 ways. On thr same 15$ subscription? Its more work that way.
---
It will still be fun because there’s definitely more to Vanilla than difficultly, but there’s definitely a missed opportunity to not tune group content similar to how private servers do. 
---
In fact, a lot of Vanilla raid mechanics will never be experienced because the boss will get DPSd down before the mechanic starts.
---
Goon squad?
---
Maybe this video. https://youtu.be/Vw7PWlwyFoM
---
Search goon squad wow and you’ll find all the other videos. 
---
I think they were the crew that did the lock summons off the cliff too. Some funny stuff there.
---
You don’t need gear for MC.
---
Oh okay, I shouldn’t be as confident in my memories from 14 years ago. I just remember always associating the enchant with live strat.
---
I'd love to see the rushed out and incomplete zones get the rest if their quests. Azshara would be wonderful if it was filled with quests. Also the 5-10 additional quests they worked in at TBC which made the flow better between zones.
---
Second would be a guild bank. Just the size of a single bank alt, but with options to give others permission to access portions of it so stuff doesn't rot because you cant break TOS for account sharing.
---
They have said they take age into account
---
Well, i wanna know more about it. I started vanilla a bit late so had no idea about AV takes enourmous hours. If some people that experienced that era care to explain more, i would be glad.
---
“Palm Desktop” haha. I miss my Palm Pilot
---
Damn, this guy coming in on his high worse with the 20/20 hindsight.
---
FYI, even on overtuned pservers, you still don't have tanks spec'ing prot, but they will need to play the role of a tank and be in defensive stance/bear form, have a shield, etc.
---

---
You rock thank you!
---
Warriors t3 Dreadnaught set. Holding a corrupted ashbringer.
---
As a mage main, trolls blood pots are still useful from 1-20. The difference in downtime between drinking every two mobs vs drinking every 3-4 is definitely noticeable.
---
Oh don't you worry. There will be plenty of terrible guilds that will wipe to those mechanics.
---
Great stuff that you complied up all together!
---
That’s the best way to do it in my opinion. I always maxed out my professions at every ten levels before moving forward so I could be as helpful as possible to other players. I even play a mage to also be helpful (and blast you into oblivion... Horde scum). Providing food, ports, bandages, potions, and making enough money to be independent financially and even helpful financially. It adds a huge bonus to the social factor in WoW to be so helpful.
---
Thanks!
---
As Wowhead started up at the very end of vanilla, there aren't too many Wowhead comments out there from that time period, so we chose to include some 2.0 comments so people could find things like quest objectives and NPC locations easily. If there's something that doesn't make sense to include, we can look into removing that subset of comments, maybe we keep 2.0 comments for quests, but not items.
---
What the fuck are you talking about.  Even with a damage difference of one that adds up to a huge discrepancy in the damage you are taking over time.  It is certainly not "insignificant"
---
Would the fact that he had access to TBC talents change anything?
---
It'll make twinking easier and people can do never ending runs for the absolute best gear and it'll saturate low level PvP with twinks which can be extremely frustrating when you make an alt and just wanna have a little bit of fun.
---
Yes but "likely" not at launch. 
---
https://youtu.be/Wl2SxjsCcHQ?t=198
---
*smoke em if you got em, boys*
---
Personally I'd really hope not. One of the beautiful things about Classic is that there are only two ways to learn about another player: reputation, or meeting them face-to-face. The armoury worked against that, allowing you to just look someone up from anywhere without ever meeting them. And it gets even worse if information is available there that isn't normally available in-game, such as talent builds, PvP stats or raid progression.
---
And yet, in Vanilla, Horde still got all but one of the relevant PVE World Firsts and were widely considered the dominant PVP force.
---
lol, like Alliance are near any type of objective in WSG.
---
brb rolling druid
---
I just remember leveling like omg I want fiery so bad and when I was finally able to get it was the greatest feeling just looking at it glow.
---
Yeah.
---
Honestly, this is my attitude for like, 90% of QoL changes and things. If people are making addons to make it easier to do, why not just adapt those into the base game? I mean, obviously there'll be some conflicting opinions on *how* to do it and you could go with the argument of 'Addons give players choice'.
---
But they're basically *required*.
---
how about both?
---
more stam for fights where armor doesn't matter, more armor for where it'll make a difference.
---
More stam just means you're less likely to be one-shot, but doesn't prevent your healer going oom from having to heal a warrior with half the damage reduction he should have for his level.
---
there's a balance to strike there and it'll also depend on the fight in question. Sometimes you'll want a lot of HP because you'll risk being one-shot and the healer's mana won't be an issue cause the fight will end quickly.
---
very later on, you can end up over-mitigated and not be able to generate rage, in which case you'll want to replace some mitigation with other useful stats.
---
As I pointed out in my post, simply buffing HP/Dmg actually contributes to the experience because it simply makes the content more punishing without changing the spirit of the game. 
---
I know how this sub feels about pservers but they are somewhat of a testament to that.
---
*[Really Sticky Glue] has entered the chat*
---
Man me and my friends spent so much money on lvling enchanting at low lvls and getting your sick glowing weapons. Such a waste of gold but it was fun.
---
You did in 2005 bud.  You must be kidding yourself
---
The beta only covers levels 1-30. Anecdote of one, but IIRC in vanilla WoW dungeons were pretty darn easy until later. The first "hard" dungeon was Maraudon, and that was only because some of the mechanics were poorly understood or ignored. And then BRD really increased the difficulty factor, greatly punishing groups that didn't play properly. Scholomance was initially considered almost impossible without strong mage/priest CC.
---
I'm not saying any of the dungeons in classic were super hard, but the early ones, basically all of them before Maraudon, were generally super easy.
---
TL;DR: comparing low level dungeon elite damage is silly, they were never hard in any case. The real test will be looking at BRD and Dire Maul elite damage.
---
it's not necessary, you don't get xp in battlegrounds in vanilla. xp-off was implemented as a direct response to gaining xp in BG. In vanilla you can gather all the necessary gear and explore areas while you have xp to spare. running dungeons on a geared out twink is pointless.
---
Other than not having smooth 1440p, 60fps, 144hz screen... I MISS these days
---
Gnome warrior, hobit style. Just in time to take a break in the Shire. No adventures wanted, thank you.
---
&gt; If you hit 60 and you don't have anything done, you will have to go back to the lower level zones anyway.
---
BRD key quest awaits
---
I thought I was the only one! I literally don't know what to do right now lol
---
It's only a prank bro!
---
Ragnaros isn’t a healing intensive fight.
---
It really feels like the 'Entry level position, 3+ years experience required' of MMORPGs.
---
Wasn’t there a global lookingforgroup channel or something in vanilla? I remember it slightly and also remember it being removed? Am I crazy
---
LIMEWIRE!!
---
I agree with this. I hope the oceanic pvp server is called frostmourne.
---
&gt; a lvl bracket where you are not getting the amount of quests you need to lvl on them alone and you need to grind
---
I have yet to find such a thing, even in Vanilla 1.12. Early in the game, 45-55 was kind of a bitch, but you should never run out of quests in Classic.
---
While true, the average player will be much better in 2019 than during Vanilla, thereby altering the average players experience with respect to difficulty and the derived sense of accomplishment/achievement.
---
thanks for the reply!   but  thats not it :/  :/
---
the search continues......
---
That is exactly my memory of original WoW. Early dungeons really were all pretty easy with a competent group, it wasn't until Maraudon that you started seeing some serious gear check and mechanic-tesing fights.
---
Lot easier to get a headstart when you have private servers (with dubious and incorrect information) feeding the database. Wowhead is starting from scratch with Classic itself with some of the data they had left from Thottbot, without relying on private server data.
---
Quest objectives and NPC locations make sense.  Those wouldn't have changed before Cata for the most part.
---
Items, abilities, and comments about mobs/bosses/dungeons just change drastically in some cases after rebalancing.  Even if the layout of a place stayed the same, or the use of a spell, it was just all talked about in regards to a set of standards that we either won't see at all in classic, or won't see for a long time.
---
I know that's also a huge amount of data to sort through though, and you probably don't want to cut out content that you don't need to, so hopefully the community can help out on sorting that too.
---
I farmes g to get dual phantom blades with fiery back on my Hunter. Why because I could...
---
And be cause I didn't know how to play
---
It is a bit strange that Druids weren't given a proper res but I would be against this, just don't think Blizz should mess with spells/abilities/talents at all.
---
When I healed 5-mans as a Druid I'd just prioritize getting one hybrid dps class with a res. Or jumper cables as someone else pointed out lol
---
Within the next few week, I think they will increase the level cap, all the way to 55. Increase the number of beta testers, and offer level 30 template characters. 
---
Then sometime after the second original stress test, they will up the cap to 60, and open 55-60 templates... 
---
At some point they might go full open beta, with 60 characters to test endgame... So full orginzed groups can go in a full clear the raids to make sure encounters work right... IDK...
---
Source= noone, just speculation
---
Yours isnt used in your every day life?
---
i hope so i like being able tonlook peoples gear up
---
what expansion did we get that?
---
It has a gold cost already, I would expect that to limit it enough.
---
Did you make a fire
---
I've been using Class icons as my discord icon for YEARS. Thank you for making some HD versions.
---
That’s probably true. However, the average player in 2019 will be significantly better compared to in Vanilla, thereby altering the average player experience with respect to difficulty and derived sense of accomplishment. 
---
There’s a reason why players complained constantly on the K1 pserver about the content being too easy.
---
I was in this situation and to counter the urge and to pass time i did download a vanilla fun server and im playing on there from what i have seen ingame there are lots of other people doing the same
---
Funny you should ask, Halo Zero iirc was a 2d halo platformer that was made by a fan. It played pretty damn well for a fan made game.
---
Very easy solution: go into dungeons with a party of 4, or even 3 instead of 5.  voila instant challenge.
---
Or go in at a lower average level.   we did this already in the original days
---
Let's just say that AV taking more than a couple hours was the norm, not an exception.
---
As  Taliesin  said in his latest video
---
"Classic will never be able to replicate how shit you used to be at WoW."
---
AoE looting
---
I think we will see two distinct camps. Those of us who understand what's going on. And LFR tards who are used to drooling their way through raid content and when they can't do that, they will bitch.
---
Yeah, if we can have a restarting server every 2-3 years I think time-limited stuff makes absolute sense. That would be very authentic. But if they're going to park it at phase 6 and walk away and all servers will forever be locked in there, I think it makes more sense for some things to occasionally return. Either option adds replayability. I'd prefer the more authentic of the two with a resetting server option or something, I'm just saying if it's going to be a static phase 6 for eternity, that isn't comparable to an evolving experience and so I don't think "ohp we changed our minds here are different mounts" really fits in with that in the long run.
---
Yeah this seems common. A lot of people "played" vanilla but didn't see end-game until TBC, myself included.
---
Yeah, that's fair. There's options to sort by highest rated and oldest first as well, so people can see the comments they prefer. Our focus right now is on filters, manually adding dungeon loot due to lack of uploads, adding block values, and a gear picker, but maybe sprint after next we'll review the comments.
---
I fish as alliance to keep my cooking up.

I have a playlist that features important songs from throughout my life and is sorted by year. 2005 was mostly all about Alternative Rock and remains my favorite year musically in the 2004-2010 bracket. My fondest early WoW memory was listening to Smile Like You Mean It by The Killers while leveling my Troll Rogue (who remains my main on retail today but is a Belf now) in Ashenvale in early 2005. Here in Australia we have a national radio station called JJJ that used to play Alternative music (and some Pop music that verged into the Alternative) from all over the world and my music taste was heavily inspired by that. On the weekends they also played all the music videos on TV at night in the form of a program called Rage, and yes, there was plenty of room for the shitty Pop Punk that teenage me adored.
---
[Here's](https://pastebin.com/sLPMiJqR) the 2005 year from my playlist. Some of these bands/artists were never popular internationally and some definitely aren't active anymore so don't be surprised if there's a lot of random stuff. The song name is first and the artist name is second on the list because I copied it over from iTunes.
---
Hi, /u/Antipathy17
---
Literally just gives Ret something to do that isn't refreshing seals.
---
God, I don't know how anyone plays Ret - my brain just starts melting out of my ears at the very thought of it.
---
Which at the point they were making these balance changes were completely irrelevant for 99.9% of the player base.
---
Were you scared after awhile that people would quit? Did everyone stay awake for the entire time? Or was there a was to take a nap? Haha. Could you tell the opposite faction wasnt letting up? How close was it? Was someone turtling the entire time, or did each faction get pretty close?
---
How’s fishing in 1.12?     
---
I miss the challenging fishing.
---
Been playing a personal private server.  It passes the time I guess.
---
Thanks for saying this - I get the feeling lots of people forget this point.  The classic wow community is currently a group of hardcore enthusiasts.  Everyone in the classic beta is a hardcore enthusiast.  I strongly suspect this will not be the case at classic launch.
---
When classic launches for real; I foresee many casuals, first timers (to anything resembling vanilla at least), nostalgia buffs, curiosity seekers, etc.  Children born around the time of Burning Crusade will be on the cusp of becoming teenagers and might give classic a try; that will be an audience that wasn't even alive for vanilla the first time around!
---
Gotcha. Ty. I knew it was in WoW at some point early on. Just not this early
---
Totally get this! I'm doing the same...trawling through screenies to get the old guild back together for classic release.
---
Super underrated post.
---
And less people.  MC &lt;30.
---
That's ridiculous. You're phasing content either way so may aswell keep everything in. 1.12.x was chosen because it was the most stable/refined content patch for vanilla when it comes to gameplay/mehanics, talents and items. Saying unarmored mounts shouldn't be in there because "we're playing this patch and not that patch" is your own opinion and none shared by the devs.
---
They've already said why they don't want them in: people will feel obligated to level fast.
---
Which i personally find crazy and it's that behaviour that turned people away from WoW retail, we do not want to be handheld or decided for, we are our own character, our story is our own.
---
Sorry about that. Ill try not as hard next time. But im glad someone agrees.
---
I agree with you. However, the average player in 2019 will be significantly better compared to in Vanilla, thereby altering the average player experience with respect to difficulty and derived sense of accomplishment. This statement applies whether you look at early dungeons, later dungeons, or end game raiding. 
---
Either way I don’t think the game is doomed. However, based on the successes and failures of pservers I definitely see it as a missed opportunity to not tune the content to accommodate for the average players increase in skill/knowledge.
---
Id rather just down vote and bully everyone that wants changes off the sub.
---
What evidence so you have for ClassicDB using Pserver data?
---
This was me, and I am sure a ton of people were like me. Originally, I shared an account with my brother, and didn't get to 60 until ~AQ release (I started playing in December when the game was released). I did BGs and dungeons, and dipped into raids a little bit (parts of ZG, MC, and AQ20), but was too young to be on a regular raiding schedule. I was still young enough to have to ask for permission to play on the computer lol.
---
So I 'played Vanilla'. but not the way many would describe it.
---
Was it still possible for a respec to fail and you would essentially just lose your money?
---
Yes?
---
Gotta go fast

Coolest screenshot in the sub
---
Doesn’t that go against the entire principle of Classic though? The whole point was to experience Vanilla as it actually was. “No Changes” was **HUGE** all over every forum and social media. Adding a bunch of health and armor to bosses/mobs is just adding artificial difficulty that was never there in the first place. 
---
It’s not Blizzard’s fault the Pservers didn’t actually give the real experience and tainted everyone’s perspective on it. It’s not like there weren’t people who didn’t know or put the information out there. 
---
Preach for instance in his Vanilla legacy videos straight up says “....but that’s okay cause the game’s not hard”.
---
Seconding this. Nothing is funnier than beating a caster by just healing and cleansing through all of his damage without even trying to hit him until he's tapped out on mana and you're not.
---
Dare r many whelps.. handle eeeeet
---
Seeing many posts about what class to choose for classic. Posts about detail things like warlock/pally mounts. Posts about lots if new comers to wow because of classic.
---
I also see posts about "what happens after naxx"
---
"Sharding/layering"
---
A lot if streamer clips. Hype posts. Memory posts.
---
I feel like your post (this one I'm replying in) is truly a shit post that deserves to be deleted.
---
You’re not getting the mounts. End of story.
---
I mean, there will still be only like 2 epics per boss. People raged through them on pservers too. I dont think gearing will be any faster lol
---
K1 was 1 month after Nost.  (they tried to launch at the same time but their last test realm crashed so badly they had to postpone launch) .  This gave Nost such a big lead that K never came close in popularity.  But you are right that there also were many differences in scripting between both servers
---
Don’t know if anyone told you but don’t mention T&amp;E on Reddit. lol. People here aren’t generally a fan (mostly because Tali is almost always right and they can’t/won’t accept it). 
---
But you’re totally right.
---
Toxic private server players posts are being downvotes, with good reason. This is still a classic subreddit, the only difference is we don't spend as much time proclaiming how much we hate BfA. Since we're actual adults we can express joy over the things we like without dragging it down by expressing hate for the things we don't like.
---
As much as I remember all the kind people that helped me out in the beginning by explaining and teaching, your kind was there too to ridicule any other suggestions.  : )
---
There's always a need for some people to yell 'N00B' in place of 'newbie', so keep up the good fight.
---
That will help preserve the original experience as well!
---
I’d like to argue that wotlk was the first xpac where they did utterly neglect open world game play.
---
Think about it, what was there to do in wrath? Raid? Bgs? Arena? None of that is open world content. 
---
The only reason people had stuff to do in wrath was because the achievement system was still super fresh and doing old achievements was wrath’s content.
---
The bliz staff and such were also actively screwing with the realm in the official part of the test last time, messing with layers and things, etc
---
I do not fear not having Dual Spec.  That was the first major change Blizzard made that made me upset.
---
I played Prot Pally in TBC with a shit-tier taunt and pretty much never used it. There was some use for it for OTing Magtheridon, IIRC, but not much else.
---
Taunt is **NOT** the biggest issue in Classic. The issues are 1) limited mana pool, and 2) shit itemization, in that order. The 10% of healing returned as mana ability and actual Prot Paladin specific pieces in TBC made them viable for most tanking (and the best by far at AOE tanking).
---
Where are you pulling these % from lol
---
Layers will disappear as players leave so yes. The remaining layer will have a healthy authentic 2500 cap
---
I used to make a lvl 8 BiS toon and reck all lowbie hordes in Kul Tiras Durotar. It was quite amazing with Crusader, Grenades and BiS enchants. Runed Copper Axe was the best 2h Weapon availabke. I had like 700 HP and spent hours to get all the BiS.
---
How is that good business, as opposed to offering both options? Theres literally no positive to forcing people into TBC, and doing that would only be a huge hornets nest in terms of PR, customer satisfaction, and ethics in general, considering Blizzard's comments thus far about the permanence of Classic.
---
Isn't Satyr's Bow Dire Maul gear?
---
If anyone is joining Classic with some preconceived notion that MC, BWL, or any of the raids (besides MAYBE Naxx) would be difficult like they were back in 2005, is living in a delusional dream world.
---
Hey, you all have a plan and you're working on it, so best of luck and thanks for making a resource!
---
I'm not complaining, and I've been using the site a lot again for the first time in years : )
---
Just pointing out a couple 'immersion breakers' for myself (which is weird, since it's a site and not the game itself, but whatever).
---
No.
---
Sure, you'll have fun with it just dont expect to gear it out in raids unless your guild is okay with it :)
---
to be fair, at this point an EQ veteran would be closer to a semi-senile geezer who can't keep up with double-digit APM than a reliable source...
---
Everquest, especially classic -&gt; PoP, was ridiculously simple...
---
😂😂
---
If everyone here has not great gear and the tanks have just crafted FR gear they are going through at LEAST one submerge
---
You arguments are such shit
---
I thought skipping it was a common thing though... Could be wrong.
---
There were also wipes of people fucking up pulls.
---
Overall, it was about initiation and positioning. Like, if your party didnt HUG THE WALL in that hallway going to Thermaplugg, you'd aggro 50 packs.
---
Oh that's super handy! Added.
---
In PvE, it’s pretty much just resto. Enhance is RNG spec in PvP.
---
Dance studio, or player houses.
---
there were no "balance changes" to dungeons past 1.8 or so
---
and none of those changes affect low level dungeons
---
The only issue I see is that it would pull away from the community aspect
---
omg. stormthuman! the trade chat legend.
---
I mainly liked it for myself, and looking up gear to go after. Its more of a nostalgia thing for me, memories of my friends and I in the computer lab looking into our characters.
---
&gt; Pet attack speeds were normalized in, eh
---
&gt; I was thinking of *run* speed
---
I don't buy it, Captain.
---
Welcome! When you're using polymorph in a dungeon to CC a mob make sure to double cast! it's always good to have a backup cast queued in case the first one gets resisted. And don't forget to earn that vending machine title! Mana classes will love you for it it's seriously a life saver. Great way to make friends and a small spare bit of cash too while leveling.
---
I genuinely believed this when I was younger

Talking more about guides like this that were posted back in 2006:

---
pservers will not even make 10% of the retail classic community. and the hard-core portion of those will be even smaller.
---
Garr will surely wipe tons of guilds
---
I really think a major factor in people picking Warrior back in Vanilla was that it felt like the "middle of the road" option, or rather the most familiar option, when choosing a class.
---
I know that's how it was for me. "Oh, a Warrior. He swings a weapon? Yup that looks simple enough."
---
Yeah, but he included others.
---
You can utilize Bloodrage once combat drops to nullify the decay while your healer drinks.
---
people will be begging for changes when the game has been out a month
---
its just tue nature of wow
---
not sure what it will be but it wont be vanilla
---
40 grit, baby
---
Doesn't matter. Insane private server players will still claim that it's wrong and that there's some huge conspiracy.
---
Thanks so much for the list, I've been using it, and I'm glad to see it updated! If you don't mind adding meme-specs to the google doc version, I made a guide recently for leveling rogue with daggers. It also feature my very own dagger list, which I am rather proud of.

---
you talk as if every guild on LB/K3/ND/ etc cleared bwl in 30 min
---
How many viruses did you get from limewire alone?
---
You asked for predictions. Based on history and majority opinion, this is my prediction.
---
3
---
it's not because you make guide that you are good.
---
Everybody can make guide outlining the most basic aspect of the game...
---
I played the shit out of Vanilla.  Probably like 2000+ hours.  But I never truly killed any 40 man raid boss.  I mean, I snagged a pug Rag and Onxyia kill towards the end when AQ was out, but don’t consider that an accomplishment.
---
Vanilla was like prep work, as they streamlined raiding a little better through TBC in WotLK.  This started as just fixing the broken classes in BC.  Rolled a paladin and spent 500+ hours getting to level 60... sorry newsflash, you can’t tank or dps.  BC did a good job of starting the uphill battle of fixing classes and making healers/tanks more viable.
---
Many of nights in Vanilla was finding pugs for UBRS, LBRS, Scholo, and strat.  As a full time student and restaurant employee, my schedule didn’t include a set raid time.  My goal was always tier .5 towards the final year of Vanilla.  Think I gave up failing the 45 minute timer on strat run, too hard to pug.
---
However, getting in a pug for UBRS was one of the most fun experiences I’ve ever had raiding.  And I went hard in the later Xpacks included 3D Sarth drake, heroic everything in Wrath gunning for server firsts.  I top those dps leaderboards (worldwide) in some of those raids, as wrath arcane mage truly took some insane resource management.
---
I’m excited for Vanilla, because I get a redo.  Not as some scrub who didn’t have the time, or understand shit.  But as a seasoned raider who understood every little detail.  I know know why movement speed is best, I know how to double pot, I understand raid wide dps will effect my own cool down management.
---
I feel like Jordan coming back to win another title.
---
not about Pserver. it's retail experience.
---
the amount and complexity of mechanic &gt; a bigger patchwerk fight.
---
Lol. Are you thinking of Aspect of the Viper? Viper Sting is in Vanilla.
---
Half of that will happen
---
1-2
---
So in the start if say 500 people log on a server on each side. Alliance and horde. There are going to be many layers at that point? Like not just 400 people logging into valley of trails till server pop is at 2500. Then it splits to a new layer?
---
I'm confused on how layering helps with initial launch. While having 2500 lvl 1-15 in the same zones is a shit fest. 5000 doesnt seem that mich worse to be honest.
---
Are the hardcore no chnages getting what they want with mass login and competition on launch?
---
i don't think itd be that bad, people used to duo run emperor all the time. It's probably going to be 20x easier in Classic in 2019.
---
Do you happen to know where to get it/download it? Didn’t know you could theme W10 to make it look like XP. Does it have the sounds and stuff of XP too (log in/out music, etc.)?
---
If the population stays peaked and stable long term their best bet would be to create more servers move people around and remove the layers. If not they would have been blatantly lying and would see a huge population crash from people just quitting. I for one would pull my sub and quit the second blizzard hints to layering staying permanently. As would many other people.
---
Idk if I ever played an RTS game, would I need to have played the first 2 to get it?
---
All of MC can be 25-manned  in gear available to players at that content phase. A marginal decrease in one priest’s healing output does not make that player useless, as you said.
---
So i've seen many approving unarmored mounts to be in the game in various forms but also some of you do not want them at all.
---
I'm curious, is this a personal thing for you like you do not want time-limited stuff in your games at all or are you thinking about hypothetical others where you feel the need to protect them from this?
---
Un-armored mounts were part of classic and they are not removed due to "playing patch 1.12.x" but rather because devs think we/you will all feel stressed out trying to get them. While that may be true for a very tiny minority i do feel it's weird since there are other exclusives in the game that even less of us will get the chance to achieve with even less time. Should not those be removed aswell if this is the case that timed-exclusives are a bad thing? Or do we simply not care as long as we have "protected" the leveling experience? Let me know what you think.
---
Windows 10 seems scary at first, but it grew on me and now I can't imagine ever going back. The whole hate for win 10 is similar to  when win 7 came out. Some hated it at first and now everyone loves it. It's like a cycle.
---
Pro Tip: Get windows pro version if you want to differ updates (although I'm not sure why you would want to). Home version is the version that forces updates.
---

His mom probably dropped him on the head as a child.

2 hours on alliance I believe.
---
Not not at all, 3 is fine as a stand alone, and if you have played wow you will get it
---
9 - for that DnD Ogre Mage hue.
---
Looks &gt; stats.
---
I was 12 and 13 for most of vanilla. I hit 60 late, and raided maybe once a week. I was horribly itemized, and had a lvl 52 crossbow. But with enough practice hunters have plenty of tools to 1v1 most classes, and are Gods in wpvp and bgs.
---
It's fun in the ultra rng sense in pvp, the chances of you getting into raids with enhance is VERY slim, if you want even a sliver of a chance at raiding as enhance then get nightfall asap. Enhance is the worst possible choice to have nightfall since they have an awful uptime on the proc, but you might be able to find a raid that can't find any other classes with it.
---
Just go resto for raids, it'll be a much more enjoyable experience for everyone
---
yes, and layers will collapse into normal server pops.
---
I'm so glad you asked!

1) According to [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20181001000000*/classicdb.ch), the first existing evidence of classicdb.ch's existence date back from January 29th, 2018, merely 3 months after the WoW: Classic Announcement at BlizzCon 2017. Considering the first signal of a Classic client available to the client was the frankenstein 7.3 client we saw in last year's BlizzCon (with obvious Legion artifact features such as the LFG menu being accessible), it is incredible how they managed to get a database going so early, unless they either stole information from other databases... or they were fed information via private servers.
---
2) The whole misconception about Elite NPC damage being off started from a [misconception brought to us by classicdb](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br86ov/elite_damage_is_way_off_evidence/), a misconception that was proven wrong by [Blizzard themselves](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/elite-npc-damage-is-way-off-plausible-evidence/178518/78). How do you explain Elite damage values being so off if classicdb allegedly only used Blizzard data? You tell me.
---
Don’t be 30/21 can heal or tank anything before raids just fine. I healed Mc and bwl as it too. You just have to gear correctly for each role
---
Any time. If you have any other questions (or if anyone else does) feel free to shoot me a PM.
---
I actually went back and looked at my excel spreadsheet with my purps in it and I had some really fun pvp nonsense gear like the rune of metamorphosis and ancient cornerstone grimoire. I think my goal is to create a nonsense gear set up where I can summon a bunch of nonsense like barov peasants, skeletons, furbolg spirits, etc. AQ 20 is really where the feral set up rounds out even without BWL loot because you get the unending life set (especially the hammer) and the boots of the vanguard. By then you will have some pvp gear and the belt of preserved heads from ZG and you're in a strong set up.
---
Nobody should want leeway the way it's being shown on the beta. The game would just look outrageously laggy. 
---
If somebody who didn't know much about the game saw it doing that, they would say "wow that wow game sure looks like a lag of a time". Explaining to them there's some gimmicky shit called leeway probably won't convince them of anything.
---
Done and done.  Yeah, the Google Doc is full of meme specs, including a melee survival hunter build, a rogue dodge tank guide, 3 (three!) guides on a Starshards Arcane Priest build, and an entire section on Shaman Enhancement tanking.  Yours is tame by comparison, and fits right in!
---
bUt wHAt ABout pRivAt SeEEerveRs?
---
You want 8 resto shaman (1 per group) for the most part, totems are ridiculously good
---
Alien Isolation is too much for me. Check out Soma and Observation for less scary games with a similar vibe.
---
Yeah, I didn’t experiment much, just ran on the road to get an idea of it
---
for sure. pretty sure its located in chicago im an hour outside of chicago and get 8-10 ms to stress test server
---
I‘m too old for this already. What I need is a comfortable chair, some tea and healthy snacks like nuts so I won‘t feel the gaming session for the next 3 weeks
---
&gt;*mostly* No Changes
---
There's no such thing. You're either changes or no changes.
---
Yep. Vanilla WoW was me running into a druid in bear form and asking how he became a bear. Then logging out and making a druid.
---
Classic is people min/maxing their cookie-cutter character while using a guide for the fastest leveling. Can't forget the add-ons to change everything about the game too
---
&gt;thinking you're actually making a coherent argument
---
sad
---
Dm mace isn’t out for a while. You can make the gold back for the warden staff reserving first orb for tanking live strat in like 10 runs or less.
---
&gt; Why even comment if you don't know what you're talking about?
---
Nothing I said was incorrect.
---
There are improved graphics homie
---
*I* recognized about 1/3 of the folks... your memory is not as good. ;)  It was fun to see Madbob in the game again, even if he was getting killed. Horde side, I think I miss Bignose the most because he was always entertaining to run into in the open world, even if we could only communicate through emotes.
---
Can you make one of these with night elves? (Preferably the female model)
---
Sure thing. I'll DM you when I can get back to my computer
---
*rick &amp; morty pasta*
---
You forget the talent tree revamps. Those made things easier
---
Game is a huge grind. Can easily get burned out or just buried.
---
i hope it's the low-functionality version of armory like B.C.-era.
---
if it live-updates like modern armory, that can potentially cause problems with premade pvp (queue dodging)
---
So, no evidence. Just speculation.
---
Same with me. My idea of orcs was always biased because of WCII and III, so I always had the idea that orcs needed to be relatively green
---
You're correct. In many situations it wasn't worth the GCD, so you'd use heroic strike instead since it did comparable threat.
---
&gt;shenna
---
I was always under the impression it was common to sort of come and go and the people who began the match likely weren't the same ones who finished it.
---
You literally just made a big deal out of the first 10 points for stance dancing. Also, improved Heroic Strike for the Rage cost reduction is a waste. If you think 3 less Rage on Heroic Strike is huge, then it's no mystery why you would have mobs running all over the place in a Dungeon run.
---
My boys switched to loot council nice!
---
&gt; It reads like somebody implying that they simply weren't in the expansion.
---
You read it as you did.  I played TBC from beginning to end.  Nothing I said was incorrect.
---
&gt; TBC had a lot of issues, however attunements being removed in later patches was not one of them. Nor was shamans and paladins no longer being faction exclusives.
---
I disagree.
---
It wouldn’t hurt to use a paragraph once in a while
---
Awesome.  Yeah, I also used to gear up low level toons.  Some people don't realize how fun it can be.
---
&gt; this is all minor gameplay changes.
---
Could not disagree with you more.
---
Yeah I wouldnt mind that
---
Those are not balance changes to dungeons
---
Okay
---
Yeah I'm sure people just saved a better archive of databases than the main wow database for years in the off-chance Classic ever becomes a thing. Especially when they get information wrong, in line with private servers that have been proven to speculate their own information. 
---
You can keep using them if you want, just be wary that they're not accurate and you're spreading misinformation :)
---
This is wild! Can you actually play with these visuals?
---
These people won’t be raiding for the first 1-2 years, at least not 40 mans.
---
I was on a high pop server and almost nobody ran PUG 40 mans with any degree of success.  It wasn’t until AQ that you really started seeing any formation of pugs.  And they were not that successful.  Any top guild running them, was just doing it for the gear pieces their core raiders were missing.
---
https://lutris.net/
---
There were no tbc rogue talents that gave physical damage reduction, no.
---
Why can't I?  Many of the shitty things about TBC are still in the game today.  It's not my fault Blizzard didn't have more foresight about things like flying and the like.
---
First played in the open Beta in summer 2004
---
I had fun with Mordhau over the weekend.
---
No quest addons till after phase 1 fight the BFA babies! But yeah man I'm tired of the fight already I just stopped reading a lot of the addon/QOL posts.
---
Apt username.
---
Sigh. I remember playing a warlock in vanilla and giving my voidwalker the strength scrolls. Ahhhh.
---
The exact mechanisms are not public knowledge, but the idea is that if a server has under 3k or so people online, it will only have Layer 1. When the server becomes sufficiently overpopulated, it splinters off some of the current playerbase into a new Layer 2, and most new players logging on will join Layer 2. Eventually, this might happen again, and some players from both layers might get moved over to Layer 3, and now most new players will be loaded into that Layer.
---
There's also some kind of algorithm set up to try and preferentially match players to the layer on which they have the most social connections, and try to keep that layer consistent between sessions so you're likely to run into the same strangers and enemies over time.
---
And yeah, launch is gonna be a shitshow. I'm overjoyed about that, even if I loath the layering system as I currently understand it. I can get a smooth, convenient questing experience any time I want in the months and years after release, but I can only get a chaotic clusterfuck with hundreds of people all running around Northshire Abbey on launch.
---
What time does the stress test begin?
---
Thanks for clearing that up. Look forward to using wowhead like I did thotbot in WoW Vanilla and Alakazam in my EverQuest days 😊
---

---
It's not fishy, that's literally how it was we just sucked. 
---
There are multiple videos of vanilla low levels tanking these mobs taking the exact same damage, give it up already.
---
&gt;When I first started playing classic I had never played a mmo before. I remember seeing reviews on the game and saying how stupid it looked. So I passed the game by.
---
About a years later I was at work and I meet a new hire. We started talking. I asked him what he did during his down time. He said he played wow. I was like what is wow?
---
He started what seemed like a hour went by while he explained what the game was. I remember vividly the passion in his eyes for this game. He told me I should get it and he would help me out. So I bought the game. Installed it and started playing.
---
I started a night elf priest name Foster. I was immediately hooked. I couldn't walk away from the game. I had no idea what I was doing. I was dying left and right. But for some odd reason. It was OK.
---
My new friend Freezerburn a human frost mage showed up in in teldrasill. He gave me a ton of rune cloth bags and 10 gold. At the time I had no idea the advantage that gave me. So we ran around for awhile. He was showing me how God mode he was with lvl 5 mobs. He was 60 BTW. We had so much fun that day.
---
Then he had to leave and get ready to raid. He explained to me what that was all about. I remember thinking how cool that was going to be once I hit 60. As I played I started learning more. I was getting stronger.
---
At lunch break at work I would pick freezerburn brain for any information I could get to become better. I quested more. Died a lot more. Was making a list of npc mobs that i was going to come back when I got stronger to kick their ass.
---
Freezer and I spent hours in game talked getting closer. We ending up being like brothers. I was soon approaching 60. I was so excited. 56 to 60 seemed to take the longest. The day came. I dinged. It was glorious. Then Freezer told me. The game has just started.
---
I was remember thinking it seemed forever to get to this point. What's is left to do? I joined His guild and I started all my attunment quest. I started to raid. I remember my first raid. I was so nervous. I wasn't physical stepping into harms way but somehow I hadn't separated myself from my toon. Its crazy I know.
---
We went on to conqueror azeroth together. Slaying the worst the deepest dungeons could throw at us. Then my best friend passed away. 
---
Wow was never the same after that. I said I would never go back. But now with classic just around the corner. Something I never thought would happen. 
---
In honor of Freezer burn. I will be joining the battle once again. Healing my new friends that I make in game. Thank you Blizzard for listening to us. See you guys and gals in game.

Slightly inaccurate data is better than no data at all.
---
&gt;someone doing actual engineering on a laptop
---
oh, you're one of those software "engineering" people
---
WoW was the casual mmo when it came out. If you want a challenge look up DAoC or EQ classic servers.
---
i wanna see a speedrun clip that the MT didn't used a shield
---
The comment of mine that you responded to was about gaming mentality in general these days, not just WoW now vs before. 
---
I do disagree with you on the key abilities comment though. Of course it varies from class to class and spec to spec, but if you're specifically going for the main abilities in one tree and forgoing the smaller bonuses to be better in other areas, you should totally be able to pick up most, if not all, of your "key abilities". It's not as though I'm pretending you can play a "hybrid" fury warrior if you haven't taken bloodthirst.
---
Bought it and played it over the weekend. Brilliant game. Well worth the money. Just needs more maps...
---
Play retail if you want casual content
---
They were, and then they were removed and/or nerfed.  Sunwell didn't really have anything I would consider an attunement, and attunements as we knew them never really returned-- something that has remained to this day.
---
It's pretty clear where the paradigm shift happened:  https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Instance_attunement
---
all of the TBC grinds were miles more demanding than vanilla ones
---
Classic was harder, it was more challenging. But it was not more difficult, it was mechanical extremely simplistic and easy. It was harder and more challenging because you needed to be able to both find and work with other people.
---
Dungeons in retail are several magnitudes more difficult than anything vanilla or TBC had. There are also a different kind of difficulty with personal responsibility, interrupts, and mechanics being the key points. 
---
Where as the difficulty in classic was, again, the ability to both find and work with other players. In addition classic was more about preparation than execution. And, TBC was about CC and priority targeting instead of interrupts and CD management.
---
This is of course just my personal opinion, having played since the last phase of closed beta to current retail, with some gaps along the way (skipped pandalanda and the back half of cata).
---
Lol. This is a new level of toxic. It’s like you’re just warming up for all the guild drama.
---
People in this sub are flat-earth level of retarded sometimes.
---
Reckoning was only good when repentance was in the protection tree. Are they going to release with the OP version or the nerfed one? I don't play right now and honestly haven't looked up which talents will be on classic release.
---
Asmongold eats ass on stream?! - Stream Highlights
---
how is that a shame?
---
To pull out my old meeting stone story.
---
WoW in 1.5 determined that a party of 2 mages, 2 priests, and a rogue was an acceptable random party by it's algorthrim. And it was correct. We crushed the deadmines easily, just required some tweaking of the tactics until we made due with what we had.
---
and it was overall one of the smoothest deadmines runs I'd ever had.
---
Tell me about it, TipsOut has a guide for pretty much every dungeon (even if those are plagiarized). 
---
But just reading through the guide you see discrepancies like needing one of the Dps to CC, needing your group's average level to be 36+ to have a chance of beating Herod (admittedly this suggestion was probably overly cautious even back then), needing a dedicated tank, etc.; while none of this is even close to needed in the Beta.   
---
Keybinding all your abilities saves a couple milliseconds at most, Asmongold seems to follow the same gearing philosophy of "armor&gt;everything else" and blue is better than green that everybody did back in Vanilla. I just don't see these being enough to make it so you can just run in and pull every mob in a room and not be in any danger of dying.
---
That k you for the reply.
---
I have been wondering about this sin once layering was announced and nobody seems to be discussing it.
---
It is one of the things blizzard was concerned about and can quote Ion saying something about sharding for initial launch to make it smooth for everyone.
---
Afterwards people blew the fuck up on forums and this sub about it. And a lot of people said. Blizzard would never allow that clustwrfuck to happen.
---
the one thing he didnt mention is that wotf is on a 2 min CD but trinket is 5. so as undead you will be a fear breaking machine. and you look alittle bit cooler
---
Wrong. It implies the developers to turn it on or off. It is part of the code. Getting rid of it would be like taking it out of the build. They are not going to take out tech that they might use later. Imagine the AQ event where servers would normally crash.
---
I mean... simply introducing new versions of old talents, reintroducing mob tagging, continuing to introduce flying later in expansions and making pathfinder much harder like in WoD to curtail flying, making it actually dangerous to fight mobs until BiS geared, dramatically slowing down gear progression, reintroducing raid keying etc. would basically do a lot to restore the game to at least BC / workload if someone actually focuses on player engagement when making the game and there is sufficient content.
---
The question is what happens if you DON'T have a mass exodus of players by the Phase 2 hard cut-off date, so you're left with a server that averaged something like 10k concurrent users apread across 3 layers, who are now sharing the same, unlayered realm.
---
Most likely, we'll see the return of log-in queues, plus some new servers with free transfers to redistribute server population.
---
How about skinning enchant on that Finkle dagger that had +skinning too.
---
Was the only way to skin the beast and dragons in raid.
---
Finkles has the Dagger keyword, so it wont work.   
---
    
---
The reason this works is that fishing poles don't have a weapon skill, you cannot use instant attacks, but you dont get glancing
---
Nope, been playing on private server for years. I'm under no illusion that it's hard.
---
Point I was making is the tone he gives off his he's trying to "pwn" classic fans because he has the scoop on this particular facet of misconception about vanilla damage.
---
It's like...chill brah. So people forgot the damage of 15 year old game...not exactly mind-blowing to understand.
---
Yeah it seemed like a no brainer they would do that. Guess not...
---
any class in particular? i may consider rolling one
---
Double life steal rogues were horrifying in PVP servers.
---
You do a dungeon twice, the second time with all your abilities doing twice as much damage as the first. Is the second run not easier than the first?
---
Moot point, Finkles counts as a Dagger and would still have glancing etc.
---
People had different standards coming into vanilla than they did coming out of it -- the same goes for BC, and WotLK, and so on.
---
Do you know how many people used a spreadsheet in my Molten Core and BWL raids? One. One rogue did, who later ended up rerolling on a different server to push progression with a top 5 guild.
---
Most people clicked their abilities, turned with their keyboard, had no concept of rotations, and literally went AFK for large swaths of raids. Most guilds were carried by 5 - 15 competent people up until AQ40/Naxx, when all of a sudden mechanics required everyone to pay attention.
---
I remember doing Scarlet Monastery with my friends for the first time. We were all barely leveled up enough to do the dungeon, and we didn't have a tank -- so we had our hunter use his pet to tank the entire dungeon. That's how we cleared the instance.
---
It was hard for us -- but we had *no* idea what we were doing.
---
If it seems easier now, it's just because people are (in general) better at the game. Very few people will click their abilities. Very few will be unaware of what stats are good. Very few will be mindlessly going through the content without any idea of what their role is.
---
Did someone say Windfury?
---
You bet your ass my hunter got beastslayer plus 2 on his axe at level 15. Early Wow was a magical time.
---
It is rocket science for blizzard in 2019.
---
They do not want to merge servers, just layers and they don't want queues... which are inevitable.
---
People believe they will merge the layers after a month or so but I doubt it... there are no mmorpgs people want to play, after the first month I see the Classic pop increasing if anything.
---
yeah undead male and female have the best animations from what ive seen. kinda like troll animations too though.
---
Achievements
---
During the real vanilla days (not private servers) BG queues were popping at all levels until TBC launch
---
His tone indicates he only cares about reking classic fans trying to make sure everything is accurate, rather than make an objective post that's more neutral, intended to inform.
---
Not knowing why wasn’t an issue back then.
---
You got enchants because they were cool.  Not because some excel sheet on Wowhead told you the theoretical max dps.
---
The "weapon skill" is fishing
---
Embrace your inner grinder...
---
We used it in bwl, I wouldn't count that as the earliest days
---
On phone so can't link, but Skarmtank on YouTube has made some videos of fury tank in Naxx
---
I see you had all the good games installed. Well done, sir.
---
you may get gear if they run 1 enhance shaman for that 1 specific weapon proc
---
No, it's pretty clearly stealing - here are two screenshots of the exact same item on Wowhead and Classicdb. Clearly this is just an example, but the comments are *exactly* the same down to the date and patch (many of which are well after Vanilla). 
---
* [Alanna's Embrace on WH](https://i.gyazo.com/cf7bb892f735848058d468c177f51737.png)
---
* [Alanna's Embrace on CBD](https://i.gyazo.com/196330eef2dbec7aaf85a2f3ad66e6d2.png)
---
Considering that CBD didn't exist until long after Vanilla, the **only** possibility is that obvious that CBD ripped them straight from WH. They even include obvious references to random things that didn't exist in Vanilla such as "this item belongs to a transmog set".
---
That isn't to say that they don't have some information which Wowhead doesn't, such as the aforementioned Elite NPC damage errors, but given that information was added to CBD *before* Classic Beta started means the **only** possibility is that it came from private servers.
---
I'm not sure what more "evidence" you need, short of the owner of Classicdb taping a video confession, because this is pretty ironclad.
---
I plan on semi-speed lvling to 60. I want to enjoy the dungeons. But I'm playing a warlock and I'll take skinning at start and likely nothing else (besides cooking/first aid).
---
The plan is to grab all the easy stuff in Durator to lvl cooking decently as I go but put it on pause later. Cook/make FA items on Zeps, etc or in small batches as I go.
---
Get free mount at 40, grind to 60, then pick up herb/alch or mining/eng and gathering on my free mount and also fishing/cooking on the off days of raiding.
---
I'm not wrong. We're sitting here saying the same thing. I was just clarifying what you said, because regardless of if you agree, you worded it in a way that could confuse someone. Saying it can be turned off, someone would not naturally think you mean *the developer* can turn it off, theyd think *you* can turn it off. Since historically not mentioning the subject of the sentence implies you are the subject. Regardless, I was just clarifying what you said. Let's not even get into the fact it doesn't really mean anything considering blizzard could probably turn off sharding too.
---
ive raided semi-seriously (nothing server first or whatever, but 10 hours per week, sometimes more) at various times in my time playing wow (summer 09-now), but ill definitely be going fairly casual on Classic.
---
Im frankly fine with a game where i dont have to worry about min/maxing everything, even in a fucking level 20-30 dungeon.   I want a game where upgrades are meaningful, and leveling is a commitment that will seriously take some time.  I want professions to be a bit of a grind and feel *good* to max out.  I want to make friends while questing/doing dungeons/whatever else i do.
---
I dont need something to be super incredibly difficult (especially in things that are already group content) to accomplish that.
---
I understand that a lot of this community is more 'hardcore', but theres a shitload of us that arent.
---
The loot tables dont make sense in anything other than the most recent expac, and even then not really.
---
60 if I can hack it. Possibly Rags kill by then also
---
Orc or tauren shaman, that way your closest to the barrens for easy deviate fishing and ratchet isnt to far to hit the boat to STV for the competitions.
---
Yes it was, lol.
---
The game didn't have anything remotely challenging until AQ40/Naxx.
---
Why do you think people freaked out when they had to do BC heroic dungeons? The reason why WotLK was so incredibly easy was because everyone who thought they were incredibly at vanilla had to interact with difficult content for the first time and they couldn't take it -- so Blizzard made five mans trivial again.
---
Absolute madmen not using the left side of homerow for key binds.
---
Mythic Uu'nat is definitely casual content. Nope not difficult in the slightest.
---
If you saw a twink with firey/icey/agility, you fucking run lmao
---
Did Onyxias lair, but never got to raid the original Naxx. Really looking forward to that
---
If the data is public, it’s not stealing.
---
WoW: “Well... at least we are not Everquest!”
---
Thank you
---
Actually, on the 27th is going to be thousands upon thousands of people staring at loading screens and queue timers. 
---
With a tag at the bottom from Bliz that reads “you asked for a genuine Classic experience”
---
Yeah man, this smugness is getting out of hand!
---
1. this isn't about player damage, this is about mob damage
---
2. 1.12 talents are not "twice as much damage", especially not at low levels, fucking lol
---
its not remotely close because PoD is 4.00 speed, the slowest weapon in the entire game.
---
As for the toxicity, trust me I try. That means not associating with the general public, because I value the truth above all. Thing is if you are nice to everyone who spreads misinformation then they are more likely to continue doing it. PC culture isn't doing society any favors. At the end of the day I would rather tell the truth and you can hate me.
---
^ Yes.  This.  2.4 also removed attunements for both CoT Hyjal and BT.
---
depends if what they said was reasonable but wrong, or if half my brain cells died from reading it
---
Yeah the attitude of wow has changed so much it won't be the same in that regard.
---
Threads like these really reinforce how much older I was than most of you guys
---
Yeeap.
---
You're remembering correctly, but we're talking about newbie tanks learning the system. You don't get Shield Slam until 40 and Revenge is too conditional to rely on alone. Sunder Armor is your bread and butter.
---
They said there isn't going to be any sort of login queue at launch. Are they going to disable character creation for popular servers? Otherwise I don't see how you prevent everybody from congregating on one "main" server because playing on a crowded server is a million times more fun than playing on a dead server.
---
Now i know :D
---
Seems awful. WASD, get Razer Naga and cast spells with your thumb + shift/alt. Your system is backwards.
---
Largely cause they never fucking read chat or never take suggestions. They just keep being bad.
---
Colossal? Isn't the hunter mostly auto-attacking. Forget pet damage for plenty of bosses in Classic btw. I haven't done the math myself yet, but 15% raid wide spell damage &gt; damage of a single hunter = likely. It's either a hunter wielding it, or a warrior, and the latter would be sacrificing far more raid damage.
---
My name was Hektor, I was an undead highwarlord warrior from Kinetic guild played/pvp'd with unbreakable throughout our time on Frostmane, Unbreakable and i still connect from time to time, I can put the myth to bed now, he is still alive and well
---
I have grinded up to R11 twice.  I love the mechanics of PvP.  Like figuring out how to best navigate a big fight.  Or strategizing a Battleground.  Etc. 
---
But honestly, 80% of LvL 60 PvP once WSG comes out is going to be the following:  Premade vs 10-person pug.  
---
Premade rolls down and wipes the 10-person pug.  
---
Spawncamps.  6 minutes pass and 3-cap happens.  Moves on with life.  
---
It isn't fun for either team and doesn't actually prove any skill other than you could find 9 other people who no-life grind gear in the right team composition.
---
My solution would be that you can only Q with up to 2 other players (team of 3) for solo Q.  And then if you want to group with a group of 10, then you'll be paired up with other groups of 10.  Otherwise, people will find its incredibly boring. 
---
Also, if you've played on a private server, you know that usually the horde team Q dodges OR leaves if they see the other team.  Especially because Ally is so favored in WSG.  Idk...that was just my experience on both servers.
---
I'm playing Rome: Total War. Which came out two months before WOW, oddly enough
---
Holy crap good idea
---
i remember it being exactly like this in 2005 as hunter lol.
---
I've always heard Proper Prior Planning Prevents...etc lol
---
yep. and all of those things will still keep happening
---
I beg to differ. _I'm more shit now_.
---
Lol “been here since day one” you are the problem
---
warlock for pet to draw agro if you find a mob spawn near you until you finish that cast, unending breath (even though its only 10 minutes) as far as race goes....... unsure. I would say dwarf because they would be the type to drink while fishing, but i dont think they had warlock dwarfs in vanilla...... or now for that matter. I don't play dwarfs.
---
No goals per say. I would guess I could reach lvl 40.
---
If you are stuck in the pack on launch 1000% level fishing. Gives you something you need to do that will provide you a benefit throughout the leveling process and it doesn’t even take that long. You can get close to 50 skull ups in a single lure which helps you level cooking to almost 50 right off the bat.
---
Finally I can look up warrior pvp without bajheeras spam
---
I guess you haven't lol, pservers dont even come close to what playing a warlock in 2004 was like lmao.
---
Thanks for proving my point, now go practice that terribly difficult boss, you'll get it eventually.
---
Tell him to come back home for classic
---
I was 14 I think.
---
For sure. I'm rolling full spriest this time
---
Yes I had a close friend who I would buy a good amount (30 or so 20mg IR) each month for really cheap. He doesnt have ADD/ADHD but was able to fake his way into getting prescribed. It was pretty easy for him to do it actually, he started at 5mg XR and then slowly worked his way up. I thought about doing it myself, but I really dont trust myself with it...its my weakness. I'm grateful I've never tried meth because it would destroy my life...adderall almost did.
---
The CE pets are even worse than unarmored epic mounts. You wont even have a shot at them before thr game launches. At least the 7 armoured everybody who played Classic had a brief chance.
---
Modern art style (including models etc as an option)
---
Not like anyone checks the sidebar.
---
Who the hell downloads porn?
---
It would not be hard to buff the damage if the community really wants it ala private servers. Not all is lost.
---
No, dont want an beta invite.
---
I'm excited about the release, not the beta. 
---
Lucky for me I have plans. Kingdom come just released their last dlc, so I will be busy replaying this game with the 3 dlcs I missed.
---
Mount library
---
Thank you bobby b
---
Caveat is that you should know how to tank, especially to gear up and OT on larger boss fights.
---
Also, don't expect that the warrior tanking is looking only for the tank loot.
---
There is no base resist stun afaik.
---
All fun and games until someone asks for Blessing of Kings.
---
I spent my lunchtime eating: no fake.
---
Looks sick!
---
You speak the truth
---
Also. If you just have to go back and do it later at 60, have you really saved time?
---
Granted some people won’t fish/cook, but if your day an alchemist is highly recommended you do.
---
Again? So you missed artifact weapons, legion legndaries, Azerite gear and crucible of the storms gear.
---
You only need one BoK pally per raid.
---
I killed it 12 days ago.
---
Don't you need two accounts for that?
---
Thats that talent tools like on classicdb and thottbot were made :)
---
My first character was a priest, and I thought that fade was supposed to make enemies stop attacking me in general. I never remember reading anything from the tooltip that suggested you had to be in a group for it to work. It just read something like making enemies less likely to attack you, so when it never worked while I was leveling, I quit using it. I even experimented with it that it might mean that mobs will attack you but not as close a distance, which also was not the case.
---
To be fair alot of those people who played EQ were still morons. CH rots and auto attacking while pushing flying kick or backstab / not nuking till much lower hp were not difficult. Alot of eq's "hard parts" are done by a couple people like pulling and positioning the mob so it corners and sitting people out of los of aoe's.  
---
I'm not saying asmongold is smarter than the EQ vets. What I am gonna say though is just like vanilla wow has a bias of difficulty rose colored glasses that will be changed everquest did as well with p1999 and TLPs.
---
I don't get it.
---
Im referring to the numers basically
---
I am currently playing the battlenet restart game and its pretty lame, but maybe it will be fun one day if i get beta.
---
Armor was not changed from 1.12 to 2.0.1 afaik. But I looked up the formula as it.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_reduction
---
States:
---
Therefore, the increase in the amount of damage the player can take compared to having no armor at all, as a percentage, is:
---
(Armor / X) * 100
---
So double armor is double effective health. So my point stays valid over all classes (wearing plate)
---
That being said the first 20 levels are not a material portion of the full 1-60 grind.
---
Bartender
---
That is my plan as well lol.
---
Enhance for levelling then Respec into either deep resto, or an enh/resto hybrid so I can still do world content while being a good healer.
---
Maybe my experience was unique. My server started with a few progression guilds, but they soon all turned to pug charters. Nearly the whole damn server ran scheduled and coordinated "pug" raids based on a server wide shared zero sum dkp chartering system. Most of the 40 mans were 20-30 common people from a guild with semi permanent free agents filling the gaps.
---
https://www.engadget.com/2008/07/16/15-minutes-of-fame-more-than-mere-leftovers/
---
That isnt a good argument. As Blizzard have said they will do item gating i.e. items that were released in later patches wont be available from launch, for example Titanic Leggings. Following that same philosophy they could implement unarmored mounts and remove them in the second phase. Simple.
---
Now, the real reason they are not going to be in the game is because Blizzard dont want people to feel pressured to rush to 60 and grind.
---
yes it was pretty much like this or just afk. whoever says differently is talking out of their asses to try and look cool and also "fuck blizzard" or whatever
---
Maybe because until naxx you will need 2 tanks for a 40 man raid + one off tank for some encounters.  
---
finding a Tank spot in a raid guild is gonna be really difficult because of this.
---
&gt;That means not associating with the general public, because I value the truth above all.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
or because he was using Thunderfury as a crutch, there were many better rogues, IE: Thorrism, Namu, Shizzaro etc.
---
Kidding of course. Just mentioned it because it happened on a pserver WSG recently. 
---
Rogue: BoK please. 
---
Me: Sorry I specced into ret instead.
---
Rogue: You mean buff bot doesn't have buff? Silly buff bot. 
---
Lol, funny interaction at least. :)
---
I had a warlock, not a main but an alt. If you were a free kill as a lock then you were getting out played. Fear at the level you were talking about was op as hell
---
Red is Dominos for action bars
---
Blue is recount damage meter
---
Don’t know about yellow
---
ppl didn't saw naxx because it was too close to tbc not because it was unattainable
---
You: "Retail is for casuals"
---
Him : "Example of boss that is definitely not for casuals"
---
You: "Thanks for proving my point"
---
Me: "?????????"
---
I guess we had too many rogues crying 24/7 if didnt have windfury for 10 sec. I swear in our raid you could wipe the raid because of pulling aggro no prob but if a shaman dared place wf totem put of rogue/warrior range it was drama.
---
Shadowburn and Fireball have such low prios,though.Would their debuffs ever show up or push something more meaningful off the boss?
---
I was Ickthas on ER.  Whats up my dude?
---
Blizzard has never done a WoW open beta, and I doubt they start here.
---
My guess is that they peg the next level cap at L50. This keeps players testing the following dungeons:
---
* Scarlet Monastery (Armory/Cath)
---
* RFD
---
* Uldaman
---
* ZF
---
* Maraudon
---
* ST
---
There will also be L50 class quests available here.
---
This leaves out the following for when L60 becomes the cap:
---
* BRD
---
* LBRS
---
* UBRS
---
* Scholo
---
* Strat
---
* Alterac Valley (req L51)
---
Lucky you i could counted on one hand the amount of time we had a shaman in the healer group. They were basically placed in mdps and tank groups 24/7.
---
Depending on tier and what weapons you get either DW or 2H fury for DPS.
---
Even in raiding you will need a couple of fury warriors to OT on some fights.
---
There is still some stance dancing as DW for flurry procs off Overpower
---
I played it but damn I was bad at the game. I was always on the bottom of dps meters because I didn‘t know what a rotation was and never got any professions over lvl 50
---
No I mean literally fail. Like you pay 50g to the respec guy and he would just go "woops! Couldn't reset your points try again". I vaguely remember it being that harsh. Am I completely wrong?
---
First month? I am planning to create Lord of Light ( Ragnaros ) cult in RP-pvp server and fight undead in massive world pvp
---
ur awesome!  coming to vanilla as a newbie, this will def ease my learning experience and get me more prepared!
---
side note.. idk if other class has guides but i will be playing rogue and i dont see any fresh 60 rogue gold grind guide ;( i just wana get gold so i can get my engi to max level lol
---
Never happened to me on any of my 7 60s.
---
If you compare xp to sugar, group dungeon grinding is like eating and apple and quests are like high fructose corn syrup.
---
Kinda creepy how persistent and obsessive you are to 'call me out'.
---
Run naked and free
---
I have to check the times for EU. In Austria tomorrow is a day off for every worker. Best timing ever
---
I was honestly enjoying BFA just fine until I got an beta invite. I can’t be bothered to login to my ten year old toon, now. I need classic full time.
---
Lmao it was never over 100g. 10% drop chance means 1 in 10 people leveling in the Barrens will find one (and likely 
---
a higher %; you kill way more than 100 mobs in the Barrens). That is *so many people.* 
---
By the time anyone had 100g to drop on a recipe, there were dozens of them on the AH, and no one was paying that price. The recipe is not that rare; someone taking the time to farm the fish is 
---
Source: I paid for like 5 mounts almost exclusively with Savory's in Vanilla.
---
Yes, the bulk of their money from wow is from expansions and mtx, not the sub.
---
It would be nice to have some class additions that did make sense lore wise. Like Undead Hunter (Sylvanas). Or gnomes with a healer spec would be nice. 
---
(And I'm not just saying this because I stopped playing before Undead Hunter was a thing and didn't get a chance to main one... *cough*)
---
Again, waiting to add items in the game that were available in patch 1.12 is not the same as adding items in the game that were not available in patch 1.12.
---
This is what happens when you start talking out of your ass and have no idea wtf you're talking about.  You should delete the thread and move on man.  You've been shut down repeatedly.
---
6 for my lock and 3 for my sham
---
Looks like your being successful. Nice!
---
In Vanilla, it was so unknown due to its rare spawn mechanics that very few people ever knew about it. I myself only happened upon it by accident because I liked the white bat skin but didn't want to level a Ressan, so my only other option was to nab Blind Hunter.
---
If it doesn't get fixed, though, I suspect a different meta in that regard due to the years of pserver activity and well-documented pserver fixes regarding BH (one even handed out bans for using it, iirc).
---
Same.
---
I think you don't realize how much gear a hybrid needs to outdps a dungeon set warr/mage/rogue.
---
Yellow is Swing Timer
---
Exact opposite if you are PVPing with any coordination. You you build as much stam as possible.
---
You want to be able to survive through the burst/kite. You will get kills through attrition and burst from crits, hoj, sword spec etc.
---
To check out popularity in beta you can do /who className 30. Looks like Druid and Priest as the least common on the US PvP server right now at 9pm
---
Dark Lady watch over you.
---
Yeah, if you like the cleaner look, then I think you can argue for more of them, especially the alliance ones
---
It just seems like those who wants the old ones (at least the comments I’ve seen), doesn’t mention that they want them because they look better, they just want them so they can get removed again, so they have something others doesn’t have
---
which color is the bartender? yellow one?
---
It is more challenging.
---
he started
---
And this is why it's important not to use debuffs that don't contribute to optimal raid DPS.
---
April 2005, and that was only because WoW was sold out (before digital downloading I presume) so had to wait a month or so after release.
---
You dont, fury has good sustained DPS, but nothing close to the burst from arms.
---
It’s also why arena comps felt so diverse when TBC came out. People weren’t about to reroll just to have a better team composition. They had dedicated way too much time to their main. People like Venruki were known as a Mage. Snutz was a Warlock. Plain and simple
---
Why? Because fuck hunters.
---
thanks a lot mate, have a great day and my upvote! :)
---
I'm going through some games that I've put on hold. Right now I have Witcher 2 half way done, and Final Fantasy 13, FF13-2, Dark souls 2 and Witcher 3 and Dark Souls 3 in queue. That will get me really close to Classic.
---
What was going on? Sorry, I’m curious but apparently out of the hunter loop.
---
It came out a little bit before half-life 2 if I recall correctly.
---
Incorrect. Base resist is 5%. Orcs make it 30%.
---
I don’t see why not.
---
Love how it's a subtle little thing, but if you pay attention to when you cast, you can actually kill the mob faster than if you just mindlessly spam. &lt;3
---
Happened to me too, the tanks on our server all rotated beetween guilds trying to help each other get past it but too no avail :(
---
I'll keep an eye out for one for you!
---
That's **fundamentally** false in so many ways that I don't even know where to begin. Are you familiar with the concept of plagiarism, for example?
---
Atleast he used retaliation against a mage LOL
---
 The more you say the sadder and more entertaining it is, lol. Sorry you're so bent out of shape by it dude!! Clearly hit a sore spot lol. Sorry all you comments from following me around in other subs are getting removed, they catch on to it quick because only butthurt losers do that. Get a life kid
---
get a life
---
Bartender would do what you see in the Red box.  Not sure if that's what Asmon is using specifically, though.
---
I predict at least half the Shamans will give up and reroll during the water totem quest.
---
Luckily just have to last couple weeks. The next PoE league in couple weeks should be awesome, and by the time we are bored with it, Shadowbringers is out. Playing Shadowbringers for couple months intensively until Classic comes out is the plan. Then can turn SB into low maintenance mode depending when the new raids etc. come out while focuing on classic 90% of the time. :D
---
That's my plan atleast. But yeah, couple weeks of random games until that PoE league is the first step. Got a stack of good RPGs I need to finish, then there is dota etc....
---
So no, not bored, would be if PoE and Shadowbringers hadn't lined up so perfectly for me.
---
I unironically played this way during vanilla, and was reliably top raid DPS in my guild's 40man content. We did have a few other warlocks to keep a healer stoned, though.
---
Probably wouldn't do it again, as it's pretty selfish, and I imagine it'll be looked down on this time around (even more so than last time. Some people always felt entitled to your abilities. Mages know what I'm talking about)
---
But I sure don't regret it. One of my top 3 WoW memories is ressing myself after going down during a Gruul encounter, and being the only DPS alive when me and 2 or 3 druids managed to finish him off from about 2%, with the rest of the raid lying on the floor. In DPS checks, Ressing the top DPS with no threat can be far more advantageous than recycling a tank/healer.
---
My opinion, and why I'm a no change kind of person... I think that a lot of these QoL changes are nice from a general game standpoint but they aren't classsic wow. I'm not coming back to this game because I want to be able to swap between many different specs or be able to change my character model after I have chosen it or even have the class balance changed. I'm coming back because I think that this was the best game that I have ever played.
---
While I don't disagree that many of these QoL changes make the game a little easier on the casual player and, as I go back to the game I will have to be one. They aren't the game that I wanted to play. I want to go back and actually experience the wow that I knew and loved and I want people to be able to come back and experience the same joy that I did as a 12 year old kid. 
---
I'm not against progressing one or two expansions after people have been given time to experience the content that currently exists but I'd also almost rather see those exist as standalone content and leave the classic servers as they are.
---
Female Dwarf so you can Savory Deviate Delight into FHuman casting animations or Noggenfogger into MUndead casting animations or OoD into FTroll casting animations.
---
Tbc released but they will charge 40$ for it
---
Looks amazing!! I made something like this, it was my first char, Wdwarf, dwarf warrior, with his first ever shoulders and the lion head shield from wetlands of I remember correctly 😊😊
---
I must be the only one around here who doesnt remember Wailing Caverns as a Dark Souls like experience... seriously.
---
And then when you hand it in you have to manually destroy the leftover item.
---
We all say how much we hate BFA, and we truly mean it, but when that next expack hits, we will be there. We always are. Some people hated Mists, WoD was fucking bad, Legion was bad to a lot of people, but they all came back for BFA, and they will all come back next expack too. 
---
As bad as their new design philosophy is, it's still WoW, it's still easier to jump back into than any other MMO and with shit like collection tabs, extremely high numbers for levels (120 cap atm) we feel attached to our accounts and like it would be a waste to not keep going. We will always come back even though we know better. It's the very reason they created these systems in the first place, they knew they were losing more players each year. Even at the current rate, if nothing changes, it would still take 2 more expansions for their lowest point to be beaten by the 2nd biggest MMO. 
---
I think you can definitely argue MMORPGs in general are dying though. Less people want to play them these days and none of them are truly satisfying. Kids are into shooters for the most part these days and make up the majority of gaming.
---
You can level fishing and cooking in tandem while you level though.
---
One thing that slows down leveling time a lot in WoW is dying far from GYs which can tack on up to 5-10 minute Reese’s. If cooking prevents a sufficient number of deaths it’s worth it and vice versa. Some deaths really come down to very marginal levels of health which fall within extra health from food.
---
isnt that just the skills u can learn once u hit this level? not so much of what skill u should buy at this level?
---
At the high end Warrior loses 1v1 to every other class, if gear, skill etc is equal
---
Take a look at, arguably the best Vanilla warrior, MonkeyNews, losing to SL Warlock.
---
Warriors really come into their own once they get a pocket healer, or overgear them.
---
That’s why you have time to fish.
---
One unlocks content in an effort for world progression at an even pace all at the state it was in at 1.12.
---
The other re-adds content that simply didn't exist in 1.12.
---
Fuck off if you want to be an asshole.
---
We are getting a franken patch. We're getting 1.12 talents, and gear, in 6 phases of content not balances around those talents or items. Then we get items in their upgraded forms gated to phases that never existed.
---
Franken patch is exactly what we are getting. No changes? How? There's already a giant list of changes on the table. There's was literally never an option to have no changes. It should be #Lesschanges but that doesn't sound as good.
---
Living the dream i see
---
"They hate us, because they ain't us" popped into my mind.
---
it should be the skinner's since they have the skill necessary to skin it.
---
if you need one and you're not a skinner, you should be in a guild group or offer to buy it from said skinner.
---
I think it should belong to the skinner, they're the one with the skill high enough to get it, they're the one with Finkle's Skinner. If there's multiple skinners in the group, it should be discussed who gets to skin it before the dungeon starts.
---
Wowhead doesn't own any copyright to the comments left on their site. They also don't own any copyright to the data they collect from the game.
---
Skinners roll to skin seems normal etiquette. It prob will be a race to skin in reality though.
---
So ninja skin win
---
Elder scrolls online was doing better for a time with the current wow bleeding subscribers.  But now the hype is insanely high for "classic wow".
---
Isn't it fucking fantastic that even Google can't penetrate their monopolies without being litigated to hell and back slowing it all to a crawl?  
---
I don't like Google all that much but the fact that even a company with that much money can't get in with out great difficulty absolutely pissess me off.
---
I’m here for a good time ⚡️ 💥 not a long time.
---
Armor works the same on all classes. What you missed is Agility giving 2 armor each setting the items up a bit. But strength give block value and stamina gives life so you loose defensive value for that agility, too.
---
mods out already for classic?
---
Try out Factorio. Outstanding games.
---
and so was every cc back then lol.
---
Leveling 30% of the game? That's bullshit. 
---
Leveling is the game!
---
Upping the DMG of bosses makes the fights more engaging because you can't just stand on top of everything. If the numbers aren't high enough you're never compelled to do anything because they don't matter; why bother getting out of the flames if they don't even do that much damage anyway?
---
Warriors really benefit from any other class. Even 2 warriors go faster because they have double DPS (even more because no parry block etc attacking from behind) and they have double the health.
---
Same thing I did with my tauren warrior. Except it was engineering. Every time a new branch of engineering became available to me I would buy it and then grind my wa y to max skill doing my damndest to avoid the skull mobs to me everywhere while i mined away.
---
So it depends on your guild, right? A hardcore gild never take you as true enhance, a semi hardcore guild might let you come once you have Nightfall, (2 handed axe that when procs adds 15% bonus spelldamage taken to the target) even then you have no way to proc it in that sort of raid environment since you wont be using stormstrike. (takes up a precious debuff slot) Best case scenario you get into a semi hardcore raid guild thats dkp with no restrictions and you get some decent gear, but all you do in raids is drop totems and auto attack, or worst case scenario you join a casual guild that lets you use stormstrike, but you trudge through mc and cant make it past garr. Nobody gets loot and you waste hundreds of gold on consumes just to stay competitive with the better dps classes, who arent even trying.1

I've never gotten to be part of a Blizz game beta, despite having 2 accounts over the past ~8 years.
---
According to payment by blizz I started 22.2. 2005. 
---
I don't know why I waited 11 days after release. Hmmmm
---
I certainly don't remember.
---
1 resto druid
---
8 shamans
---
8 priests
---
3 warlocks
---
2 hunters
---
18 warriors
---
If you don't join when your queue pops you get locked out of bgs for a day. Problem solved.
---
So sheep? What other cc could people chain at that level ? Plus warlock is beating a mage at that level with dots and our lasting them. Honestly sounds like you were just a bad warlock if you quit playing in HB
---
as long as you have enough healers and tanks, just fill in the rest with whatever people show up consistently.
---
Gnome rogue. Gnome for height, escape artist. Rogue because lol yeah i dont feel like fighting that. Or you. Or anyone around here. Excuse me while I slip away. You'll still have to level it if you want to take advantage of the rogue side. OR be able to fish without being disturbed. Low level characters will get molested by mobs all day every day.
---
Tell that to my Brood of Nozdormu exalted ring and Darnassus exalted mount.
---
Can't you get it in potion form? Why not just go rogue? Enemy players nor mobs will be able to adequately bug you if you're a rogue.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
This is probably what I'm most excited about with WoW Classic. My guess is that the economy won't really start making sense until Phase 3 with BWL. I've made a tentative list of everything that will increase and decrease in price with each new phase, but it's definitely going to be wild.
---
Anyone who did a few LFR raids and heroic dungeons in the entirety of WoW history is good for raiding for the entirety of T1 and T2 content.
---
&gt; Oh I’ll be draining the souls of the poor rabbits anyway.
---
It's funny, I've seen that same picture a looooong time ago.
---
did you compare attack speed of the mobs?  You should, it sounds like you have an excellent comparison set of videos.
---
I think few people realize how much fishing can earn. I never fished in retail vanilla but every pserver ive done ive fished and been able to buy gear every couple levels in green and blue just off the boxes from whirlpool node fishing after lvl 20ish. Stv. Tanaris. Each fishing node is worth at least a gold for 2 mins of sitting there
---
Played Knight Online and MU online while waiting for World of Warcraft to finally be released. It has already been so long.
---
&lt;Stoked&gt; will be a hard core PVE focused raiding HORDE guild on PVE oceanic servers.
---
A number of people have contacted me about the guild but would prefer PVP servers. Feel free to contact me.
---
**Main goals:** 
---
	To have fun enjoying wow classic.
---
	To push our class and raids to the limit.
---
	To clear all content efficiently.
---
	To clear Molten Core in week 4
---
**Raids Schedule:**
---
Progression raiding: up to 4 nights per week.
---
When content on farm: one to two nights per week.
---
Raid Nights: SUN/MON/TUES/THURS
---
Raid Times: GMT +10 (Times to be decided)
---
20 man raids will be on off nights or a night when no 40 man raids are scheduled. 
---
Example: 
---
Onyxia Sunday night, Molten core Monday night, Onyxia Thursday night
---
AQ40 Progression Sunday and Monday night, Molten Core and Blackwing lair Tuesday night, Chill 20man raids Thursday night.
---
**Member Expectations:**
---
	
---
Members are expected to be willing to learn their class and role. To be willing to change when needed and and become a better player. You do not have to have hard core raiding experience or Vanilla wow experience. These things are of course welcomed but not essential. Members need to behave in a mature, professional, team focused manner. I want to foster a fun-loving gaming environment where every member is important and not just a name on a roster.
---
**Loot System:**
---
TBA (possibly loot council/DKP hybrid. Will be decided closer to launch)
---
**Contacts:**
---
	http://stokedguild.com/

What a hero
---
I think if you already redeemed said code on the same account the item it gave should be grandfathered to that accounts first level 60.
---
Nope. Landro was added in the pre-TBC patch, 2.0.1. I remember having to wait to redeem my Riding Turtle. He won't be available in Classic.
---
Apparently you couldn't fire ranged weapons if you had a quiver equipped.
---
In general it is pretty easy to gear up a Resto druid do to less gear competition but I was speaking more specifically towards getting geared as a feral Druid. 
---
Good Feral Druid gear is very hard to get in wow it’s very scarce and most raids do not run feral Druids and if they do they would run only one. Best option for getting the best feral gear is to roll a Resto druid and acquire feral gear this way through raids.
---
Skinners keep it. If there's more than one that can skin him, they roll.
---
Just like rogues keep locked chests.
---
Does it stack with flametounge weapon?
---
Is submitting data, an active thing (the user has to press a button, or upload a file somewhere), or a passive thing (The addon actively sends data updates over time). Just curious on a overview of how the back-end works.
---
I agree with a lot of what you said. It makes sense why raids are so much easier now than they were 15 years ago. Back then people vastly underestimated the value of hit/crit, didn't understand the value of stacking consume/world buffs, ran suboptimal comps, etc. 
---
But like you said early dungeons are not hard. After one or two runs you completely understand them, but in Vanilla as I remember it you still had to cautious as pulling an extra pack accidentally meant a wipe (unless you were over leveled for the instance/have cooldowns up). In the beta Asmon is accidentally pulling three packs of mobs in a dungeon he is at the minimum recommended level for a dungeon, and after they kill the mobs the healer still has more than half his mana. 
---
There is a discrepancy there that I don't see can really be explained by an increased level of skill as at level 30 it's not like an class has a ton of mechanics yet (especially when person that is so much better than players back than that struggles to keep Battle Shout up half the time).
---
Whether or not they do is besides the point,you don't need copyright to prove plagiarism.
---
Regardless, I like how you've evolved your argument from no evidences they use private server or stolen data, to disregarding the evidence, to saying it doesn't matter that they use said data.
---
I can see you're clearly only here to argue, so I'm just going to save us both the trouble and block you now. Good luck with the fantasy world mate, it clearly seems to be working for you!
---
Nah, I distinctly remember mana burn and then a well placed silence finishing them off pretty good.
---
are there any tools out there to plan and manage?
---
More in the direction for group building etc pp
---
on private servers?
---
No. Part of the draw of classic is that there isn't going to be bigger and better stuff just around the corner.
---
Ive been searching for evidence of this, sifting through patch 2.0.1 notes I can't find any reference to him being added in said patch. 
---
It would make sense though.
---
Learn the math and disprove the stigma? So because private servers who do whatever they feel fits the bill on what scripts and tuning they want, remind you almost all of them encourage donations just to maintain servers so no shit they’re going to make more things viable. Quit acting like we didn’t have two full years of actual genuine classic to play/test/earnestly learn the game. 
---
Bears can’t parry or block and don’t generate nearly as much threat in the first place along with them not having enough Armor or health yet. The only people sitting here and arguing in favour of this are people who never played vanilla and want to act like they did. Ask anyone who genuinely played vanilla and they’ll tell you the exact same thing I’m telling you.
---
Furthermore there’s hundreds of videos still on the internet of guilds killing bosses and not a single one has a bear or paladin tanking. I’d like this game to succeed but sitting here making shit up is going to severely over exaggerate players expectations and everyone’s just going to rage quit off.
---
Since my vanilla fever has passed 40 degrees celsius, I took a long shot and contacted Blizzard customer support for a chance to recover my old wow account. Whoever got hold of my account after I quit from Naxx40 burnout had transferred my character and leveled it to 70 in TBC, but hadn't done much. Sadly bank had been scraped clean, so lost most of my old stuff, but T3 gear was still intact! Brings back memories :)
---
Its ash...
---
think some are playing the new world alpha/beta atm....or at least the same guild name.
---
I understand that, but how does receiving mail an hour later than you expected change/(become essential to) the vanilla experience?
---
Unfucked Valley of Trials.
---
I get it know why beta is so import for classic. Blizzard can‘t say its not a bug and it was intended because people know how it actually used to work
---
I agree. I didn't start till the end of Wrath, but I started healing at the beginning of cataclysm and I remember prenerf how hard those dungeons were. I had to drink after every pull and I felt so good after getting through a heroic dungeon. I was always told thats what vanilla dungeons were like. When they announced classic I was so excited for extremely challenging dungeons that required CC and tactics. When I saw people leveling and having trouble in the real world I got even more excited. The dungeons would be super hard, right? Apparently not. Watching streamers barely pay attention as they pulled five or six mobs  genuinely made me feel like a little kid who just found out Christmas was canceled. I know everyone is no changes, I get it, I do, but this is the first time I wish people would budge and ask them to increase dungeon difficulty.

Thats rly smart actually!

Just to clarify, by vending machine he means you make food and water for your group. Its 25% of the reason people will want you in a group. Make a lot before you even meet up. Make water before you take a flight path so you're regening mana on your down time.
---
Well...I tried
---
Now you gotta drop mining for engineering
---
I'd say we know half of what we will know. What is initial launch going to be like? Wait till starter zones fill up with 1000 people. Then create a new layer? Or multiple layers while keeping starting zones lower pop to avoid the clusterfuck. Sort of like sharding. At launch.
---
These are questions I dont have any answers. I cant find this information anywhere
---
Surely, but it seems entirely antiquated. I understand thats a weird reasoning for a classic remake but R14 is just something else entirely.
---
I mean EVERYTHING in classic was designed to keep you subbed but nothing said 'if you want to reach your goal you have to rake up more playtime than anyone else on your server' quite like R14. It's just so outworldly. It even was back then. That's kinda the difference. Nothing else ever REQUIRED you to play 24/7 in order to reach your goal. All PvE stuff could be done over months of playing a couple hours a day.
---
Asking players to play 2 hours a week is as effective to keep them subbed as asking them to play 24 a day, the latter just burns them out horribly.
---
Conversely, with normal Vanilla XP gain (read: PvE XP alway on, but no XP from BGs), both twinks and normal levelers can park in a bracket indefinitely and have fun without raising the gear level toward BiS.
---
I get where you're coming from, but this simply wasn't necessary to keep BGs popping and dungeon runs happening in Vanilla, and hopefully it won't be in Classic either.  Sure, there were and will be twinks that plan ahead and have sick gear, but making it easier to for everyone to gear up leads to making it required for everyone to gear up just to be competitive enough to enjoy BGs.  Which is the exactly the slap in the face every PvPer gets when they ding 60.
---
Guild Bank!
---
Not bad if the purpose is to both aoe and solo farm. But I would rather go for piercing ice than arcane concentration. Arcane concentration doesn't really feel that worth it while lvling out in the world tbh.
---
Instant earwig
---
Mean, too.
---
We definitely won’t see alt-aholics the same way on Retail, but alts are likely to be more popular in Classic than they were in Vanilla due to the phasing. Once people are looking at weeks between phases with raids on farm, they’ll start rolling alts for professions, PvP, etc.
---
So far ITT I've seen a ton of people who said they played vanilla but never raided it.  I think that's a fair assessment for a large majority of people here and for me personally is one of the main reasons I'm excited.  I'll get a second chance at the content I didn't get to experience when Vanilla was popping.
---
Says the scientist whose thesis gets redacted
---
Hi, /u/TIErant
---
The yellow bar is my add-on WeaponSwingTimer. I just released version 3.0 within the last hour. I have no idea how to link with mobile but you can check out my post history for the release announcement post.
---
I’m not suggesting that at all, just pointing out that the relative difficulty has changed.
---
This brings up a whole other discussion with the rogue lockpicking. I remember being a rogue in vanilla and people would roll on the chest even though I'd be the one unlocking it/spent the time and effort to raise my lping skill high enough. I recall I would often times say I didn't have high enough lping and then after the instance was finished go back to open the chests.
---
Flight Masters open straight to Flight Paths.  No dialog.  They know why I'm talking to them.  They have one job.
---
LOL omg kappa luls so funny xDDD no kap
---
All about them thotbots
---
This is an excellent guide, thanks!
---
I'm totally aware why it's happening, I just don't like what it implicates about our society.
---
Once the Wowhead Client is installed (https://classic.wowhead.com/client), you just need to hit the "Upload" button to send the data over. The Wowhead devs then process the data in batches, usually the site updates once per day.
---
Hi, /u/-breder
---
Yeah, that's what he means by a ton of time. Grind 2 levels on mobs instead of questing, saving all your meat instead of vendoring it to make space for other items.
---
I would agree the skinners should roll between them selves. But otherwise it should go to the person who skinned it.
---
He doesn't make any money on the videos because he doesn't claim them so get off your horse
---
I seem to recall them talking about that during the summit that Esfand and the others went to and if I remember correctly they said that they would utilize free transfers for overpopulated realms and if necessary open up new realms.
---
The last 1.0 patch was 13 October 2006.
---
The TCG didn't release until 25 October 2006.
---
When you saw a character like this back in vanilla you had the deepest respect.
---
Thanks for chiming in! Absolutely great info and super happy to hear the tremendous work you guys are putting in! Sounds like the database will be renewed up as new data comes in. 
---
As for the comment, I'll do my best to report as I see non vanilla ones.
---
At the moment no, it's on my list of things to do. It shouldn't be too hard but I've never played a hunter so what would you like to see? I've noticed some of them turn red when aimed shot would clip an auto.
---
But if you are in middle/high school, it's a fantastic way to get your parents to find out your kinks.
---
I'd kinda hoped the CE pets wouldn't be included. I get why they are, I just was of the opinion that Classic should have been a clean slate.
---
You can train your mining to max rank. GL
---
Just /roll on the first mining node or herb that gets picked. They'll ask what you're doing, you'll tell them, they'll laugh, then you say "ok, I keep all locked chests then".
---
&gt; So Pservers overtune the dungeons?
---
Have been for a while.
---
i bet its just private server garbage
---
Classic had a more stable economy. First, each realm was separate so you didn't have cross realm contamination in the market. Second, there was a lot more to spend money on so it was harder to bank. Between skills, repair costs, food, training, travel costs, and respec costs you spent a lot. That helped keep inflation down. Finally, in order to make good money, you had to use your professions. To satisfy the demand of crafting, some people would just take two gathering professions and sell mats they farmed. But with enough farmers competing against each other, a free market will inevitably keep prices reasonable. Granted, the economy will eventually inflate, but it will be a lot slower than retail.
---
&gt;interesting and unique mechanics
---
Happy to log on tonight and show it to you on Kazzak-Eu tonight :)
---
I think Dreamstate has some speedrun videos with Fury tanks. Skarm is also a very good source since he actually explains how it works.
---
I don't disagree, I was just pointing out the self-contradiction of him saying that the "no changes" people would want the dungeons &amp; raids to be changed to be harder than they are intended to be for the sake of fulfilling a warped memory of things being harder.
---
Everything will sell cheap early on, but nobody has the gold to buy much either.
---
Early people to hit 60 will grind mobs to get gold.
---
Highest I remeber a stack of runecloth is 2.4-2.6g during off hours, but this was pre bwl and no other cloth dropped for a year after that 
---
......no one like a felcloth
---
I've read all of those books and the only two worthwhile books are Lord of the Clans and Rise of the Horde (which seems to be missing), both written by Christie Golden. Arthas is not too bad neither. I think WoW books overall are quite overhyped.
---
mensa is the only people I associate with btw
---
The brood of noz ring was simple if you were able to participate in the opening event. I had an exalted ring after that event was over.
---
This is not true at all. Heals could always be enabled as floating text.
---
T1 doesn't require more than 30 to 35 people. Probably less if they have retail mythic experience. Staysafe said he expects T1 to fall within 10 days /played, but I expect that to happen earlier. I am pretty sure Rag will fall in the 2nd ID. I will be a close call, but with the beta giving ample time to test numbers and got form groups, I can't see him living after that.
---
From my understanding of what you wrote, you literally just restarted my opening post. What are your thoughts about the whole server starting with 0 cash, and how that slowly grows. 
---
With the projected supply from this sub as a lot of people are going to be farming mats/crafted shit and posting it on the AH.
---
Meanwhile I'll be playing as a sponge (warrior)
---
You’re wrong.
---
It’s a compacted keypad that you can bind just like a keyboard. I almost literally cannot play with a regular keyboard anymore.
---
 Nost came out a month before K1
---
Yeah, let's let achievements in post-Vanilla Retail bleed over into Classic. That'll go over swell with the boys.
---
So before it was pservers that were correct and Blizzard that undertuned elite damage for some reason. Now suddently pservers overtuned content on purpose, lmao
---
&gt; In practice - most pugs are still going to be pricks
---
Be the change you want to see. I have limited time, but fully intend on running pubs through T1 once enough players hit 60. As long as we have Tanks, Healers and DPS, we are a go.
---
Old Steam Icon FeelsBadMan
---
But Dawn of War and Far Cry, a man of culture I see.
---
respec vendor will eat nerds gold. Unless they change it. eg Alot of warriors used to run like 31/5/15 just to have a general purpose spec that was good enough to tank but still good for dps/solo. 
---
from memory the tyrs and elite drop about 1.27 gold and thats generally said to be the best "gold" farm.   
---
with everybody going for 900g epic mounts it will be sometime before people have alot of gold i think. however with alot more people playing now the gold should filter up to the top \~10% of players  faster.
---
Im convinced, funny how people for so long screamed "PSERVERS SO UNDERTUNED ARMOR VALUES XDDDD" Now that we see the real thing it turns out its the other way around
---
I wonder how different WoW Classic would be if you were only allowed one character per realm.
---
&gt; in a few resets.
---
This doesn't matter if you are going for world/server 1st kills. You are not in the instance to gear, you are in there to clear. Gearing happens after clearing the first time.
---
Making up statistics here, but let’s say In Vanilla, the average player died to Hogger 2 times while soloing prior to completion. By comparison, let's say that the average player in Classic died to Hogger 0.5 times while soloing prior to completion. In that case, was the Vanilla experience really recreated? Technically, yes. But the spirit of the game (sense of difficulty and subsequent feeling of accomplishment) has changed, due to the decrease in "difficulty" relative to average player skill and knowledge/accessibility. 
---
When someone says they miss running Deadmines, do they miss the fact that VC had 4.1k hp? I doubt it. I think they miss the challenge and the sense of accomplishment upon getting that loot drop. In other words, we’re all chasing the Vanilla experience, not the specific HP, armor, and dmg values themselves.
---
Yup, until one of our rogues came back late and had to finish out the fight naked. :P
---
God i hope Classic wont adapt the "rush south" meta that is currently plaguing private servers.
---
These long AV's were amazing.
---
Skiners roll. If skinner needs they keep or /roll if you have the quest. I think was our rule long time ago on Kalecgos
---

I didn't watch through those in detail, and I'm sure the tank might have switched to shield for patchwerk for example. 
---
Here is one video explaining it
---
https://youtu.be/u_azvBdVgz0
---
I got invited to last week's test. My account was created in 2012 so I don't think it makes much difference.
---
I mean im a different guy from the OP who pointed it out....you just keep responding
---
2004 i was 22.  I played right at launch for a little while - got to about lvl 20 or so but it took me a long ass time, then all my friends stopped playing and so did I.  I picked it up again a few months later and got hooked.  Grinded my NE hunter to 60.  Did a lot of Scholo, Strat, DM and UBRS.  I also leveled a Dwarf Priest to 60. 
---
I never really had the time to raid, unfortunately.  I think I did like 2 MC runs in which we killed the first boss or two.  Did Onyxia once or twice as well.  Same with AQ.  ZG was a lot easier to organize groups for and was overall less of a time commitment, so I did that one a fair amount. Never did BWL or Naxx during Vanilla.
---
I think people are kind of forgetting what a slog it could be just to organize 40 people and do some of the raids.  
---
If (when) I play classic, I think i'll probably just do 5 mans or UBRS, maybe some ZG 20 and AQ 20 when they come out.
---
i personally only hate him because he shit on pantheon without even looking into it, other than that he's fine.
---
You could just not take the drugs lol
---
We were doing that at level 5.
---
The strategy I've done two times on fresh vanilla servers is bags. I'm an insane person that just grinds humanoids from level 1-53ish as I don't enjoy questing. I think my record was around 200g when I hit level 40 just mass producing bags. 
---
Average time to level is about the same with pure grinding vs questing unless you're Joana or actually execute the perfect leveling route (most people get distracted).
---
Think you can raise gathering-professions too 300. Saw Sodapoppin do it on stream yesterday. 
---
Neat accomplishment though, gz! :)
---
The common versions show white as ‘ok to move’ and red as ‘stand still to shoot’ with the swing denoting how long until one of the other event begins.
---
Subscription ran out, but recently bought The Witcher 3 and I’m enjoying it so much! Easily occupied until beta will launch
---
My friend who did the last stress test wasn't invited to this one.
---
\#N0CHANGES
---
Druid since they have Aquatic form, Travel form and stealth.
---
I remember the word imba, it has been a long time
---
That's a nice sentiment but people will still rage when they can't get on.
---
If you powerlevel you can't craft items that help you leveling, when you can craft the azure or shadowcloth set you already have better gear from questing and if you do dungeons to get the cloth you have better items from those.
---
Dig ? They've been posted all over the sub, you just have to go on wowhead to have ALL the videos/text interviews/tweets to find the info. 
---
You are lying through your teeth just to hate on blizzard for free there mate.
---
The only reason they made "stop gaining exp" was to stop twinks from leveling in battlegrounds.
---
Isn't there a better rod in Hinterlands?
---
Awesome work! Definitely going to save a lot of these for later use.
---
I believe its on classic currently, im not in a position to check at the moment though. Perhaps that and some global defense channel were removed? 
---
Im susceptible to bad memory too, I coulda swore Meeting Stones by 1.12 had summoning for people in the level range--but they clearly didnt.
---
"Selling red weapon glow 1g"
---
even the old wiki proves you wrong (also I sold it back then for 100g+) where it states its 60-400g.
---
Also this is a **best case** scenario, which will not happen for most people, their chance is a lot lower as probability is accurate on the mass.
---
I love the bit at the end where he's in a BWL and pulls massive aggro with a giant crit.
---
I remember being able to log on the PTR in vanilla and make a 60 with Full T2 to test an upcoming major content patch.
---
Yes I miss this as well. Seeing someone and knowing what class they were. They were known for playing that class not just having 10 alts and being good w/ all of them.
---
My old account got restored aswell - that dude leveled to 85 and deleted / vendored most of my vanilla stuff :( .. 
---
Now I‘ve got a Magic Rooster on Retail i will never use :D
---
Use it in combat and you can't rez out of combat for 30 mins?
---
Octopath Traveler has been pretty fun
---
Either back to square one with sharding in the first zone for the first few weeks then cut it out or no sharding/layering at all, banking on the former if layering doesn't work.
---
Hopefully they manage to make it work properly so they can implement it on retail as layering, in theory, is a much better version of sharding.
---
Hmm that is not what I remember. I can't recall having seen anyone mounted in there.
---
alot of these were seen as pretty easy back then, too, for those wondering.  we used to breeze through SFK for certain loot all the time.
---
It’s took 3 hunters to kill some of the mobs for me and that was lots of kiteing and bouncing threat
---
Ah... LimeWire
---
It'll be unpredictable for the first few weeks to months. You'll have plenty of people trying to overcharge for mats that will throw off the curve but it'll plane out after a little bit. Once it does, the prices will probably start a fair amount over vendor price for basic mats and increase on a gradual curve. If I had to put a number on it, I'd say you'll see an average increase of a few copper per month across the board. I can't really make any predictions for gear just because it's too unpredictable but I can guarantee that the highest crafted gear will be astronomical in classic terms. No matter what happens though, it'll be interesting to see it rise and fall until it stabilizes.
---
I have learned the hard way with the way people treat the Auction House selling single pieces of materials that just because people won't buy it doesn't mean they won't try to sell it.
---
The auction house is going to be an absolute shitshow for at least six months. I don't plan on touching it until 60 anyway.
---
yeah most of the warrior is my guild were 31/5/15. i was a mage, cant even remember what i was. Think like 15-20/0/31-36 as a mage cause fire was useless in pve.
---
Arenas (&amp;Diminishing Returns)
---
when I got my t3 account back my guy was leveled to 62 and was dead in nagrand thankfully my bank was still intact
---
Touché
---
why does everyone think hogger was hard i dont get it.
---
Which is all that red gear under the mini map?
---
Yeah not to discourage but summer is barely starting, and we're going to have to wait until the end of it. To me summer seems to go by so much slower than any other time of the year because of the long days and excessive heat... so it's even worse than it sounds.
---
I noticed this in the stress test with the skinning knife not needing weapon skill too. But this is next level lol good find
---
Caster DPS groups probably won't get a lock. Tranquil air would be nice for warlock aggro (for the locks not providing blood pact in melee groups at least)
---
I could be wrong, but I feel like I redeemed my Tabard of Flame during Vanilla. Might've been BC prepatch though.
---
PTR is different than an open beta.
---
Fuck you fascist
---
Female
---
Oh definitely, it's a little bit unnerving honestly
---
I think they will let everyone have about a month playing vanilla before release. Whether its open beta or PTR I dont think makes a difference unless there's something i'm missing that makes them different.
---
A rogue friend spend hours in Ungoro killing the fire mobs.
---
His red-glowing swords matched the glow of his face.
---
&gt; outside of my earth elemental (5min cd, he has an AOE taunt) i just can't deal with 6 or more mobs.
---
&gt; Since 8.0 things are significantly harder than they used to.
---
Bruh....
---
This is \*classic\*!
---
I know, it's possible he was added in that patch and wasn't made available until the 25th as that was the release date for the TCG.
---
It was hard because nobody really knew what the fuck they were doing. And there were hardly any addons.
---
Untrue. You will need to farm much more than just the mats you casually pass by to get your crafting professions on a similar level.
---
Does aimed shot even clip in vanilla? I had no idea you had to stand still for some time to shoot. I'll have to watch a couple hunter guides to make it right then.
---
Exactly
---
Wahoo! Prot pally!
---
I stayed up for 28 hours on 40mg taken all at once
---
Yes I agree with you.
---
Damn mate when you dont understand ask someone I know Google wasnt what it is now but yeah. Funny though haha.
---
If you think about the econony in terms of hours spend grinding for the stuff you want to buy, then respeccing, mounts, repairs etc becomes cheaper as the server progresses. Stuff that other players make is more or less the same.
---
*Talks about weapons in a video game*
---
*Sudden politics*
---
????????????
---
And "Best Paladin in the world" Athene
---
Looking forward to those scrolls again!
---
They have compartmentalized difficulty and community aspects behind very specific content and that's mythic raiding, mythic dungeons and arena. Essentially they want people who want a solo casual experience to have that and as a result the rest of the game has suffered for anyone who doesn't like that.
---
If you don't want the mount at 40 exactly you can just keep questing and get it a few levels down the road, quest gold and grey items value ramps up in the 40+ zones.
---
Well, people with original collectors editions that were redeemed on retail, will be given there pets etc, blizzard already confirmed this.
---
I mean sorta, but they have a point. You only bring so many hunters as utility needs dictate. You bring as few tanks and healers as you need to keep the raid alive and you fill out the rest with a comp of dps the is diversified for loot purposes but stacked for performance--so given leather loot, you bring a rogue over a feral, or the Caster gear to the mage before the spriest.
---
You can swap hunter with spriest, ele/enh sham, feral, ret, balance you only bring as many of those classes as you need for their utility. 1 spriest is a benefit, 2 is a detriment. 
---
I think its a better place than balance has been at times where loot and leveling are easy, and there is a big difference in dps and no difference in utility--that just leads to class stacking. But id if i could have my way, id want parity in dps across the full spectrum of fights as well as necessary utility. (on live, considering all the specs, they do a pretty good job of giving everyone some form of useful raid utility, even if some of the effects overlap) 
---
This is all from a high end perspective. Which I dont see as incompatible in the slightest with vanilla mindset. I like immersing myself in the world while leveling and farming and in 5 mans and when chillin in org or in a pick up bg. But i really enjoy a good progression raid and stiff competition in pvp when facing another organized team. In those moments, I play to win, and i min max.
---
We had in XI, It most probably comes from EQ, OG mmo.
---
Multi boxing has been allowed by Blizz forever.
---
I wonder how it is without all the world buffs.
---
Quests and higher mobs give more gold, plain and simple we’ll all have about 5-10g by level 20 after training talents and from there we can buy profession mats or invest in cheap boes and the economy will slowly grow until supply and demand levels off for each trade good
---
Can’t see what it has to do with shamans
---
Yeah, but at least those were available during the patch timeframe we're playing.
---
Wtf, you can keep mounts across characters in retail?
---
What kind of sick prank is that!?
---
1. Hard to say. The AD-AS model will probably be able to give a hint as to how the economy will grow, if you want to get into it. 
---
2. Likely a while, there’ll likely be more gold in circulation than last time, but seeing the majority will be getting a epic mount at some point, it might not be until a few phases in. 
---
3. Yes. People will over estimate the value of their items, especially when they’re epic etc. For non-rare commodities it’ll probably be fairly volatile in the start, as many will try to offset each others prices. 
---
Everything depends on the raw output of gold, or people who grind.
---
TBC is a garbage expansion, so hopefully Blizzard takes another route with classic.
---
How did I not know this? Thank you.
---
I’d be interested in a poll done that required some level of proof for boss kills. A lot of people lie or mislead... for whatever reason... about what they did in vanilla. Asmongold the streamer misleads people heavily considering he didn’t even start wow until 2006. I wouldn’t count him as playing it. I’d be interested in how many people did MC, clearers MC, did BWL, cleared BWL, did AQ40, cleared twin emps, cleared c’thun, stepped into naxx, killed some bosses, cleared it. Everything from twin emps on would probably be like... 1%
---
Neither can the tsa
---
If you get burnt out at 45, you'd hate to hear that 42 is about the midway point in leveling as far as time needed goes...
---
I never liked the sonic games unfortunately
---
WASD is superior to a joystick though. Why is being 'compact' a good thing? It still takes up extra room on your desk since you need your keyboard for typing.
---
Ofcourse they are.
---
I think they nerfed that to like 20-30silver. Got rid some them Chinese farmers
---
The only problem with levelling cooking in classic is that you can’t really level it without levelling fishing as well, which I always thought was a shame as fishing was so boring.
---
I believe in vanilla battlegrounds don’t start until level 21 if I’m not mistaken. I don’t think there was a 10-19 bracket.
---
19 twink rogue with fiery and icy, then got fucked by rogues with mongoose in bc
---
Stealth is true invisibility at certain distances though. Isn't it the higher your level vs the target dictates the distance? So hypothetically at 60 vs a 60 if you had MoD you would be near invisible unless right on them?
---
Oh yea. It's gonna be a ride for sure!
---
Yeah I'm estimating it will take me about 5 months to hit Max level 😂
---
Not really the "oshits" more like the "we 5 left he's at 1%" tank.
---
When the rogue is tanking you know stuff is very very dirty haha
---
You get a stamp book for your mounts.  They get rep or faction restrictions, so no basic horde wolves on gnomes.  But yes, it's a big stamp collection now.  Same with pets and such.
---
That was always the case, you could usually manage to pull out run without a tank in lowlvl dungeon, but it would be slower and rely on more CC.
---
Should be group wide roll if nobody needs.  Needed a group to get there and only casters and feral druids need the pristine, and these classes typically dont have skinning.  It goes a long way to see a non greedy hunter or rogue, but everyone walks their own path.  Reputation over gold
---
You can tank dungeons as Fury at 60 as well, just need a shield and some tank armor.
---
There's no flavor in being able to change in the first place. Like why should you be able to change your talents outside of gameplay reasons? Flavor wise, your talents are special abilities that you gain through experience. A real "talent respec" would be sending your character back to level 1 and gaining new experience for new talents.
---
My god
---
That sounds wrong, since you could finish the opening questline after power-leveling the scepter-wielder to Neutral with carapace turn-ins. I don't see how everyone gets exalted from that.
---
Easy fix, just die and have a higher level kill for you, then rez and loot.
---
The one I linked, or mine?
---
It’s pretty much mathematically inferior to level as DW over 2H assuming relatively equal strong weapons. 
---
Despite what you may “feel” it’s just the facts. Also hamstring kiting is SIGNIFICANTLY more effective when using a 2H and greatly reduces downtime. 
---
The only time this really changes is on a fresh server when you obtain the thrash blade as it’s often difficult to reliably get a good 2H after the whirlwind axe falls off.  At that point dual wielding may end up better. 
---
But at the end of the day - you either had much better one handers than your two hander, you played incorrectly, or your “feelings” don’t reflect reality.
---
Why is the unarmored mounts that important to you? This is not BfA, the game is not a mount collecting game
---
I have no problems using the mechanical d-pad for movement, use the mouse below, and have binds for shift, control, and alt:
---
[https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Rival-15-Button-Programmable-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B01K3DM0WY](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Rival-15-Button-Programmable-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B01K3DM0WY)
---
I agree.  Just feels like people are too quickly forgiving blizzard for shitting on gamers for the past 10 years, and giving way too much credit to a company rereleasing an old product.
---
I actually find Classic more alt friendly than BFA. In BFA your characters are tethered to your stupid neck piece and then you have to do world quests across all characters.
---
Character alts in classic are way better because each class is unique.
---
The game will be available for US on Monday August 26th @ 3PM PDT.
---
Raid lockout will reset on Wednesday September 4th @ 8AM PDT.
---
That's 8 days 17 hours. We'll have plenty of time. Especially since multiple people will be leveling our tanks round the clock.
---
I'm not sure what you mean sorry.
---
Heroes of Azeroth TCG set was released 25th October, 2006, which is during patch 1.12 in vanilla.
---
The only thing we are trying to do here is figure out which patch Landro Longshot was made available in. 
---
Seems to be some conflicting comments regarding this, detective hat firmly secure.
---
&gt;people are too busy spamming lol meme spec to stop and learn a thing about the math behind the game
---
Authentic Vanilla experience.
---
I've been doing level 10 runs on different race/class combos. I don't want to adventure to far into the experience. Gotten pretty good at making my way through the NE starting zone.
---
 But yeah, other games have kind of aren't holding my attention
---
Actually I ran an alt mage just for skinning, ape farm circle back skin everything send to my LW.
---
&gt;  but instead dlingindependsnt research
---
Hopefully someone found you mid-stroke and got you to a hospital good sir.
---
That's native WoW, it represents gear durability. Yellow = almost broke, red = broken. Go to a vendor that can repair.
---
It's 8 days 17 hours from release to the raid lockout. Plenty of time.
---
That’s Azeroth’s Ass.
---
True, but the HP regen on the classic beta right now for warriors is insanely high and blizz has stated it’s not a bug. All the warrior streamers that played private servers are saying it’s easier on the beta to kill stuff because they are taking a lot less damage and passively regening much faster. 
---
That being said - they said respawn rates are stupidly low so leveling is still slow
---
Hunter is a little more difficult to manage than a mage. Hunters have to switch between ranged and melee early then have to manage a pet later. Mage can frostbolt forever.
---
Murloc heads to southshore....
---
Were the numbers really that low? I led a server first guild for a while on a smaller server. There were three maybe four guilds on each side that raided regularly at least. But as I type it out I guess that doesn't seem like a ton...
---
Elixir of Minor Fortitude + Elixir of Fortitude
---
or
---
armor elixir + scroll of protection
---
paladin/shaman aura + druid buff
---
Hunters in Vanilla were seen as Huntards. Like most Night Elfs were seen as bad players (look and lore idk). Stigmas goes a long way.
---
But Hunters always were a liability, they were either very very good or just useless players who didn't know how to control their pets or put Ice traps so no cc for them and source of global wipes. After a while, you do not take them anymore. Fact that they're Rolling on every single weapon is also one of the numerous factors of why they had a bad rep.
---
But now it doesnt make sense anymore. I was so much in this NE Hunter stigma that I refused to roll one until WoD. Had tons of fun. Then I played with awesome ones. And now im about to roll one in Classic.
---
like most vanilla players #nochanges
---
I was at a friend's house and we were attempting to moonwalk, for whatever reason, which eventually led to us heading to his family PC to download a Michael Jackson clip from limewire. The title of the video was "Michael Jackson moonwalk" - or something like that. 
---
It was just porn. The speakers were on pretty loud. His parents were home.
---
To be fair mongoose looks pretty fucking sick. It was my go to in TBC lol
---
&gt; Hybrid specs work with amazing gear
---
Some specs don't even work all that well with gear. Put whatever gear you want on a enh shaman it still does less than a rogue/warr with blues.
---
You have to buff each class every 30 mins if I remember clearly. Like if you’re on wisdom duty. You have to buff all mana classes with wisdom and usually another blessing on non mana classes every wipe or every 30 mins. The lesser versions are every 5 mins that don’t take reagents. When you raid for 3 hours without wipes you will buff 6 times per class and there are 8 classes so you will be buffing 48 times in 3 hours without wipes. 
---
Add to that you need to keep track who dies and rebuff them. 
---
It’s honestly not that bad but maybe current wow has spoilt us and made us lazy that’s why. 
---
They’re amazing healers though. Already done it once or I’d prob do it again.
---
...or sympathy for his/her family, friends and possible employer :)
---
According to this link https://www.wowhead.com/npc=17249/landro-longshot
---
He was added in patch 2.2.0
---
3MBps in 2005....So lucky
---
Wait, didn't they say the mailbox *will* be reverted back to how it was, i.e. the delay before things are delivered? Or are you talking about something else?
---
I was in a server first raid guild through nax. Most people ran hybrid specs. Nax was the only time I remember everyone one of us warriors went full protection
---
those are certainly a few cases you can test. Do you know of any spell power buffs this early in the game?
---
It makes no sense that they would be put on a new layer after they party up, THEY ALREADY WERE ON THE SAME LAYER. These layer bugs need to be seriously layered out before release.
---
Just hope it's not like the original launch...
---
"ya, 1 million is an awesome target"... "Shit STOP SELLING THE GAME WE NEED MORE HARDWARE ORDERED"
---
Actually, that would be awesome if it was like that.
---
Relics of wakening. And any other quest that makes me go into those damn night elf cave maps. What's the one in stonetalon? Fuck that one too.
---
I played vanilla but I was pretty young so looking up info on forums for optimal leveling, quest lines, where to go at what level was way beyond me, I made it to level 34 as a Hunter Night elf, never joined a guild, I didn't even know that raiding was a thing, I always thought all the level 60 players with mounts were literal gods when I saw them.
---
I stopped playing after TBC released, I think it took me more than 5 months just to hit around level 30, most of my time I didn't do quests, I just explored the world and did random things.
---
I came back for WotLK, and there I made it to level cap, joined a few raiding guilds, but I only made it past Ulduar, I beat naxx and Uld but never did ICC, stopped playing completely after the next expansion and never came back to live wow, only a private server here and there.
---
But now i'm back, vanilla wow was the most magical time of all my years playing video games, I miss it.
---
Limewire... i remember this as a distributor of malware
---
now i get it what you mean, dont worry i am not offended or anything, i speak 5 languages fluently :p
---
**\[EU - Horde\] Player looking for a cozy home.**Hello there!I suppose a bit of background information regarding who I am will probably be pretty beneficial.
---
I'm a way too old Scandinavian, specifically Swede who's been playing  this game since a month after EU launch. I originally played a warlock  and rogue back in the day and sunk an extraordinary amount of hours into  it. I've done every single raid on heroic/mythic up until Legion and  I've always strived to be the best that I can be at whatever I decided  to play, and always put my best foot forwards.
---
I love challenge, I love long and grueling grinds where the more I die,  the more determined I get to down whatever content is giving me a hard  time.Though despite that, I'm very easy going. I rarely get riled up, I'm  naturally very calm and logical and I'm always down for a good laugh,  some sick bants or other shenanigans.I've set my sights on playing a **Mage** this time around, to see if the grass really was greener on the other side of the fence. I suppose a discussion can be had about other classes, and I am interested in shamans but I will tell you that it's a hard sell.
---
Bit of a tl;dr of what I can offer the guild:
---
* Driven and determined old man that thrives off of challenge.
---
* I've spent the majority of my online days talking to americans and brits so I'm pretty well-versed with the bants and I'm always up for a laugh.
---
* I have absolutely awful one-liners and dad jokes and I **will** end up laughing at them.
---
* I do a LOT of research regarding my class and the content I need to be doing, as I like to immerse myself fully in what I decided to put my time into.
---
* I'm very laid back and calm as an individual so you won't hear me tilt beyond the sun on a hard boss.
---
What I preferably want from your guild:
---
* Semi-mature preferably
---
* 2 to 3 raids per week sounds like a good medium to aim at.
---
* Driven to clear all content eventually.
---
* Liking and/or loving Bob Ross. I like them happy little trees so it's a big plus.
---
I'm going to be doing as much PvP and PvE as I can possibly fit into a  human solar cycle, if this old man sounds like something you want in  your guild or if you want to discuss something regarding my post or  simply get to know me a bit better, feel free drop a comment down below with contact information and/or sketchy links to your guilds.
---
Always 4
---
The real meta trick is to do it with 'friends' and keep deleting the quest items and picking them up. See how long it takes for them to realize you have looted like 17/10 items.
---
Asmon has nearly 1600 buffed HP at level 30, on my trip through nostalrius at level 30 I had around 1k. (https://i.imgur.com/SSOWIly.jpg) And even that was significantly more than anyone I played with back in ACTUAL vanilla.
---
That gear advantage doesn't just exist on asmon though, it's all the players in his group, and as such they're doing more damage, healing more efficiently, taking less damage and pressing the correct buttons.
---
My first time doing SM library I remember I had just recently respecced to fire with improved scorch and I spent the entire dungeon doing nothing but spamming scorch. We still managed to clear it despite everyone in the group doing similarly stupid things.
---
I know it's not easy to accept but the reality is the game was never this hard and for myself and many other players this was the first MMORPG we'd ever played, even for experienced MMO players they weren't going to know the optimal quests for gearing, have the bis crafted items for the level or anything of the sort. Having BoE blues in multiple slots would be out of the question but on the beta it's the norm for most of the streamers.
---
The delusions need to stop.
---
to the 50% who downvoted my post, the answer is yes, we can jump into Hyjal in classic.
---
i am of slovak descent and i speak the language fluently, my problem are the communities that are on drak thul more than the language on the server.
---
Yup, all i want is the new graphics.
---
try reverse the question and start thinking about the changes blizzard had 2018 and how that certainly affects it... you dont even seem to realize blizzard was sold and bought... blizzard from back then and right now are under completely different leaderships and with rather different goals.
---
It makes me wonder how a person can follow something so blindly, do you lack a personality or why are you such a mindless sheep ?
---
Also if they have not lied then try re-watch all the statements they had about vanilla prior to 2018... utter denial of the existence of the possibility and excuses such as the files having been deleted...
---
if a person tells you something is lost for over a decade and suddenly says its found but cannot show you it... would you truly blindly believe that... what a bunch of sheep...
---
The real skill based gameplay is PvP Kappa
---
I always wondered about this.
---
i have an ok memory but i can barely remember how much dps i did in antorus and some people go:
---
"uh yeah i remember that back in 2004 a defias cutpurpse at level 7 did 5 damage at 2.2 attackspeed to my troll warrior at level 5 with 240 armor while i was buffed with some random druids motw i met 73 seconds earlier and a stoneblood potion i bought from the AH for 2 silver and 37 copper that i looted from following list of mobs: .......
---
Thus means, classic values are wrong."
---
MSN was all I ever used my computer for growing up aside from school work. It's probably the main reason I can type well. 
---
I remember near the end (before Facebook chat killed it) that they introduced games. I was, like, 1000-20 in minesweeper flags.
---
yeah I wanna see that on MC/BWL not a fully geared monster
---
6/Warlock.
---
Interesting! Thanks for hunting this down u/Richter87
---
This is quite strange because the TCG was released 25th of October, 2006, and for whatever reason Landro was delayed until patch 2.2.0 during TBC. 
---
Well, this has made me a little sad actually, I've held onto these cards for a decade just hoping one day to use them on an official Blizzard classic server.
---
Thanks all for helping me get to the bottom of this once and for all.
---
“So you value going further in ass”
---
Nice ;)
---
Yeah cause Blizz is gonna kick down your door and force you to use them amirite?
---
With what sperm?
---
just run to teldrassil and quest the night elves zones till 60
---
17 god damn that’s some true restraint
---
I've been replaying Subnautica, it's a blast, highly recommend it whilst waiting.
---
5 mans are tankable by shamans, voidwalkers and hunter pets if you are desperate enough.
---
Didn't you basically get it back 10-fold when you started enchanting level 60 gear though?
---
I have winamp as my text tone.
---
"Winamp: it really whoops the llamas ass"
---
Baaa baaa
---
Even so, the overall experience is far superior to wowhead. Who wants a sprawling page of useless information/news every time they go to look up quests/items. Wowheads too busy trying to be the one stop shop for all things wow, rather than a useful database... i just doubt I'm alone in preferring a simpler approach. Thottbot was the golden age.
---
Wowheads layout is enough to send me running into the simple, focused arms of classicdb.ch
---
Cooking 300. Fishing 300. Kill that fat slut princess. 100g
---
No it was harder with old talents and class changes. 1.12 every class was much stronger.
---
My problem comes from wanting to play two very different things in PvP vs. PvE. For example on my shaman I like to PvP in Enh but like to heal in PvE. The specs are gonna be different for those roles, so it'd be nice to have dual spec.
---
But I'll get over it.
---
ok, but watch your language maybe?
---
Moving when the auto shot (swing) timer would complete a cycle clips the auto shot. Swing timers were used by Hunters to track their auto timer and make sure they weren't moving when a cycle was going to complete or they'd lose that auto shot. With that info, Hunters adjust their playstyle to stutter step when needed to prevent autos from clipping.
---
I don't recall if Aimed Shot specifically clipped Auto, but movement definitely does.
---
How to build a 40man raid in classic:
---
\- 2 warrior tanks
---
Then take what you get on reliable players who will come along relatively consistently. Be prepared to scale down your "perfect" set up to around 30 max and have at least 5 slots to be filled at random/based on what you actually get. :)
---
It was not indeed, I played rogue from launch so I know how unequal it was with my 2-shotting clothies most of vanilla :D
---
Ya man if somebody made a friend in the last year of retail we had it all wrong this whole time. What's the point.
---
Can I group with you?  I’m going to play a warrior that only does /yell at out enemies. I’ve created some pretty good macros to maximize my /yell capabilities. 
---
I’ll only roll on cloth, leather, mail, and plate gear.  
---
I look forward to playing with like minded players such as yourself!
---
Speed doesn't really matter though...its the weapon damage. Yes Pendulum being slower makes the weapon damage higher, but its only 6 damage higher on average, since the average damage of Pendulum is 155.5, and Jordan is 149.5.
---
So yes it is better by on average 6 damage for your extra white hit, it's just do you value getting those bigger numbers on your windfurys or having the slightly better utility of extra int and spirit along with spell damage.
---
[Keybinding an Orbweaver or G13 Gamepad for WoW - Why I Use F1-F12 Keybindings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXoLNd0v-mU)
---
Why would you watch this from this perspective?
---
With that logic no guild what so ever except for the top 1% ever down any boss ever. Since the majority of players didn't want to respec and our guild (got half naxx) had almost everyone run in PvP specs or priest healers in shadow etc. We might have gotten further into Naxx if everyone went super hardcore but we didn't care because having fun is more important :)
---
And a casual guild that don't even use flasks doing all raiding content but a few bosses is quite ok tbh.
---
Which is still more demanding than any TBC rep.
---
Cool cool, so real quick, who dubbed eso as the wow killer?
---
Last I remembered, the're both in drastically different mmo categories.
---
But what is everything scaled to, then? 2x? 1.25x? Finding the numbers that would make everyone happy is *impossible*. 
---
Everyone has begged and begged for an official Vanilla server forever, and now that we're getting an accurate recreation of it, it's not enough. It has to be balanced to the *spirit* of the game, and not to what the game itself was. 
---
Yeah, things are going to be different now that we're 15 years ahead and people have been spending the last year on private servers getting their shit in order to speedrun their way through the game. Should Blizzard be balancing for those people? What happens to the people who are hyper-casual Retail players that never got to play Vanilla and are excited to try what they missed out on? Should they be thrown to a Hogger that's designed for people that have been no-lifing the game for over a decade - an enemy that should be, in your own hypothetical, 4x stronger than it's intended just because *some* people know how to deal with it? Fuck no.

---
The people suggesting for TBC aren't saying "replace classic with TBC" they're saying add it with the option to transfer to it, and leave classic alone as it is for everyone that wants to keep playing it.

15 Warriors (2 FuryProt/1 Full Prot if Fury Prot losses world buffs/12 Fury)
---
4 Rogues
---
6 Mages
---
2 Priests (1 with Shadow Weaving)
---
3 Warlocks 
---
3 Hunters
---
1 Druid
---
6 Shamans

9, with white hair. 
---
Frostwolves
---
Depending on server population, grinding the areas I suggested are faster than questing. Boars and scorpids up by Org can average 10k XP/hr, and the Stormsnouts by Camp T can net more than 20k XP/hr.
---
How much XP/hr is fishing?
---
So let me get this straight, you don't like TBC?
---
Oh well then. Thats shit.
---
The hacker could have vendored the T3 as well for extra profit but he held back. That's respect.
---
Pretty sure they're not gonna force anyone to play tbc if they do end up rereleasing it. You're free to play classic forever. Also seems unlikely they're gonna put a lot of effort into making new content for classic since there's barely anyone at blizzard anymore that has the design philosophy of classic, they're reproducing something, doesn't mean they can make content that's similar to the old style.
---
But tell us how you really feel! 😁
---
But you are right, wow just wasn't the same after tbc
---
Why?
---
Tips fedora
---
Hmm. I'd have to agree they have to do something about premades.
---
Well, [he didn't show up on the wiki until 8 November 2006](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Landro_Longshot?dir=prev&amp;action=history), so it's possible he was added during a weekly maintenance the day before.
---
Yeah, I am sure is eventually going to support 7 different versions of the game at the same time
---
Damn MSN 7.5. That was a good one, if I recall correctly 8.0 was pretty weird looking and people went back to 7.5.
---
Savory Deviate Delight does reduce tauren melee range in the beta, I tested it just a few minutes ago, its hard to say if it reduces aggro range, I would need to find a spot with hostile guard-type npcs that I can inch closer to for that kind of test (I did this as level 1 to test the melee range)
---
It went from 70k subscribers to 120k in just 3 weeks or so. One can only guess who all those new subscribers are.
---
Yes! Loktar!
---
Shit, thats so me. Always bad at hugging with my fat tauren, cant see shit etc. Cant wait :D
---
I know it was true, I wasn't sure which expansion it was.
---
Crusadeed dont drop from SM bro ;p
---
And "Best Paladine in the whorld" Athene
---
FTFY
---
"  **sorry brahs.** "
---
Who says that..... anything would have been better man. literally anything.
---
They are running on a very big assumption that the population is going to nosedive after a couple weeks. They are probably right, but it's entirely possible that it won't happen to the extent they expect and the population ends up being way bigger than 3.5k
---
Maybe when Blizzard pushes all the servers to TBC in ~2-3 years, they'll open up a few Vanilla-only realms that people can re-roll on. But you're definitely in the minority on TBC being a "dogshit expansion".
---
It's almost like both things could exist and everyone could get what they want. 
---
TBC isnt perfect but I love it the same way I love vanilla.
---
Blizz should just autokick afk’ers and give everyone in (a pre-1.12 version) av a mark/hour. So people get something achieved, but the epic battles that are remembered 15years later can be a thing.
---
The plot thickens. 
---
There's also evidence to suggest he wasn't added into the game until patch 2.2.0 in TBC (check wowhead)
---
6 or 1-2
---
One firey one icey for me on phantom blades ooooooooooooooooof
---
I remember when TBC came out and the main capitol was for both factions I was like wtf is this bullshit.  I agree with some of this stuff.  I really loved the feel of BC though, the music and the look of the zones, the monsters.  Also the bosses, magtheridon, lady vashj, kaelthas, illidan... lots of cool bosses from the lore.  BC started the trend that expansion = 5 new zones, every expansion from then is 5 new zones so every xpac you're just in a little world compared to the 40+ zones of classic.
---
The raiding in BC was great, the feel was great, music great.  I liked the attunements, the sockets in gear, rep grind.  I just really hated shattrath, why is it horde alliance it was so stupid.  
---
Even though BC is a slight downgrade to classic I would still like to play it again just for nostalgia.
---
By all means, point out to me the Rick&amp;Morty Episode where you think this comes from. I am sure google will assist you in trying to find it.
---
Good luck.
---
Were on Sapph but we’re not a hardcore guild. It’s the 4th week of Naxx right now where I play, and all the hardcore guilds killed KT in the first week, a few of them on the very first day it released.
---
So for really dedicated guilds, these are not hard fights. But for the majority of guilds, they fall apart/merge in Naxx (mainly due to consumes cost).
---
For us, we are the only Oceanic guild left standing at this point, and we intend to kill KT in the next week or two. Then we will disband.
---
Ok, now I actually understand your question. You mean in current WoW. I played current WoW from 2004-2008 and only raided vanilla and a tiny bit in TBC. I don’t know a single thing about the last ten years of the current game, even by Wrath it had completely lost my interest.
---
It's not bad for fishing too. You can swim to the other side of a pond quickly and cheetah is instant for moving around. 
---
Its also one of the faster levelers.
---
And smartest person ever, by a large margin ... Ugh, what a tool
---
I think they do still have people who know how to design the game like classic the problem is they're not allowed to
---
Well, given that he isn't in the Beta right now, I doubt we'll see him. Thottbot archives show him first appearing on a pre-TBC PTR too.
---
sadly only elixir of frost power &amp; the frost power buff from the shrine inside bfd.
---
most spell power comes at higher levels.
---
Yeah don't bother with mana pots and runes on CD ... 
---
I start to understand why the "huntard" meme stick to the class.
---
*Some* of what you need. In my experience you need to spend significant extra time in an area past what is needed to level if you want to keep your professions up to date, other than skinning. Otherwise you rapidly get to a point where you can't mine/herb/cook the stuff you are getting.
---
Eh.  They won't.  And that's fine.  It's just people who have never played 60 PvP are disillusioned and will have a rude awakening.  That being said, it can be very fun.  Some of my best times have been in WSG. And there's plenty other things to do in azeroth!
---
Nice binds...
---
He actually played objectives
---
I got aimed shot and steady shot mixed up :/
---
From what I've seen YaHT looks decent and is mentioned in a ton of guides. There hasn't been any word of an update for Classic so I'll attempt to recreate it's behavior.
---
Thanks anyway :)
---
Temporary virtual bank...
---
Yes, I'm thinking the same, I've had a buddy of mine travel over to Booty Bay and he wasn't able to find him (using a simple target macro).
---
Sad times. It is what it is.
---
I'd love that personally. Even one character per account!
---
WTB addy PST with info
---
Each layer is a normal server poulation. About 3k. The idea is that they are expecting a lot of people to play the game initially the first few weeks and then stop playing all together or log in far far less frequently.
---
So when the layers merge together you get roughly a normal sever poulation of about 3k.
---
My main income for some time was selling beastslaying to low level People. Just advertising get this awesome glow on weapon special price for you
---
Shows how vulnerable Warriors are in WPVP
---
Nothing lasts forever. At the rate they're going the retail version will probably be one of the first to go.
---
I checked the paladin resource and sure enough the levelling guides recommend using /sit to proc reckoning which will not be in classic.
---
To OP: please check your sources, some of he information is out of date/incorrect.
---
Top marks for effort though! Keep up the good work
---
"don't worry guys, it's just the beta"  
---
Hmm.. when have I heard the exact same words before...  
---
We really could do without layering, like we've done before sharding ever existed.
---
The minimum level for wsg is 11 in vanilla so
---
reading the comments, reddit has placed its finger on a very significant difference between 2006/2007 and now. the reason for this difference isn't because people are smarter or inherently better now than before, it's because of websites like this one that people browse every day. every last advantage that can be sucked out of this game will be found and exploited by the enormous portion of the playerbase that uses websites like this one. the true irony is that its your own fault that classic wow will not be the same as vanilla wow. the question is how to solve the problem, or maybe, whether or not the problem is worth solving. start by calling the problem by its true name and asking the proper question: is it worth it to account for the compiling and comparing of strategies with the infrastructure of 2019 reddit, or is it better to let things lie as they were? i can see it either way - increased meaning through difficulty or lowered necessity of relying on redditors to tell you what the ideal strategy is. make your own choice
---
Which family, friends or employer are you talking about ?
---
You must be one of those casual I always hear about ! /jk ;-)
---
I let myself down in expecting a decent response.
---
You are aware this is easier, not harder, in MC right?
---
This is really cool! Granted it's just an estimate but it puts things into perspective for me. Was pretty reasonable about my hours I'll get to play and speed and I never though February. That's actually encouraging though cause to me that means over 5 months of playing I get to enjoy the game before I even get to the end game!
---
nah, you still see other people because of sharding. Instead you just think "wow everyone has way cooler gear than me already, kill guys 10x faster than me, and is hopping in a motorcycle... I want all that..."
---
Neither Chance or Ziqo were streaming at the time
---
There most definitely was a 19twink bracket, it was from 11-19
---
Did the same with a lvl 60 mage farming SM in vanilla, but did the mistake of replying in a thread instead of making a new one. 
---
The dmg is correct.
---
I'm pretty sure they will do tbc, but I'm also sure you will have the option to transfer off classic to the servers. Or start fresh.
---
So you can still keep classic chars, as I would of though more people prefer classic to tbc.
---
This would be best option in my opinion.
---
Also shows how Murlocs secretly side with the Alliance
---
God. Back when randomness and edginess were new and we didn't know how dumb they were.
---
See now this is an opportunity for growth: you either say that it is okay to generalize based on who says "technology" or "science", or it is not okay to generalize by saying that everyone who's political views align with Donald Trump's is dumb white trash. You can't have your cake and eat it too.
---
Similarly "what should" and "what are"
---
I feel the opposite.  I think vanilla is great for alts.  Maybe not as good as wrath. But every expansion mop forward has been terrible for alts. Legendary cloak, legendary ring, artifact power/legendaries, and now heart of Azeroth.     In vanilla if you are up to date on your main you can just log in for raids nights and spend as much other time you want on alts.     Sure they are slow to level. But there’s almost no restrictions like with the items I mentioned before.   That and content never expires so once you do hit 60 on an alt you get to progress through mc and bwl and so on.
---
I feel like i know some of the names haha so nostalgic
---
white lvl 1 weapon + fiery was pretty op for the 1-10 leveling. If i remember correctly it was the only enchant adding direct damage to your hit. Sadly this 40 damage proc quickly become anecdotic because of the mob scaling
---
TBC is the goat. Arena and the best raids.
---
Ah ok. I don’t know why I thought there wasn’t lol. 
---
Either way that excludes level 10’s then.
---
I have had some pugs beat premades before. Those are some of the best games you can play.
---
Aren't they putting in cross realm BGs in right away? Maybe that will help a bit.
---
They also cleared SM cathedral. Doesnt matter if you are 30lvl with bis, beating up final boss with skull instead of level seems crazy on pserver level. People were constantly wiping on it even as level 40s. Which means, classic is easier and saying it was easy just because they were high level is not a valid argument here imo
---
For some reason I decided to level as a prot warrior, but opted for dual wielding or two-handing whenever I was just questing. But in groups I tanked. I don't know how I figured it out, I just did somehow. Probably just coincidence because I liked doing it in groups
---
Leveling was interesting though and I never stance danced, depending on what I wanted to do I stuck with that stance
---
Yeah but let's say you're PvE spec for raiding and just PvP on the side
---
The gold sinks you listed don't cost very much gold. Just questing and selling the highest value reward when you don't need anything is all you need to do to make money.
---
I think they should push all realms to TBC and open up a few new Vanilla-only realms people can re-roll on. Maybe give them a deadline to transfer, or not.
---
yes , theres other sites / apps to watch streamers in their full glory .. the constant reposting of streamer's twitch video here is like a cancer , people who love streamers can go to twitch and not repost their content here , as if everyone cares about streamers here.. 
---
i would rather read a wall of text of discussion here , as intended .. 
---
many game subreddit have succumb to the endless streamer post and endless effortless meme posts.. i hope this subreddit will moderate useless meme and streamer post , to keep this place informational and clean
---
got em
---
Did you try the 22/8/21 build? If so, how did it feel?
---
Yeah, the main reason I quit after naxx was done was my girlfriend. She had literally been a wow-widow for months through the progress.
---
I knew I was going to pull at some point, and I would slowly make my way to someplace that would be safe for the raid when I pulled.  SS, rez, healthstone, lifetap, maybe throw a few scrolls on, then keep right on DPSing.  Farm status fights obviously.
---
yeah thats the one i particularly interested in.
---
a week or so ago I noticed the spell pushback on mindflay wasnt working correctly. Youd get the graphic on your cast bar, but regardless all 3 ticks would go off. Seems fixed now. 
---
Ill have to wait for a higher level cap to get something to test it.
---
IMO DOT Snapshotting ruined live for me. Since Naxx 2 Northrend Boogaloo Ive been shadow. LFD, Flying, Dailies, LFR were all stomachable. But they killed Locks and Spriest with WoD (whats fucked up is feral druids still have a snapshot dot). 
---
Im very keen to see it return (even if it was rarely utilized in vanilla). Just knowing they can re implement the feature is huge--and gives me hope for live.
---
Yeah, every “classic guide” for paladin tells you to spec reckoning and use /sit.
---
Very annoying
---
On Arthas this was every-fuckin-weekend bruh
---
I'd be fine if they do it the other way around, reroll / copy to another TBC realm and leave the Vanilla ones alone.
---
I let myself down expecting a decent response. All I’ve done is uncovered as Asmon hater masquerading as a neutral.
---
That figures.  I read every forum post except THE news post.  Haha...ha, ugh, sorry.  Yeah, I see the line.  Thank you very much.
---
That would make it easier for op since hes on classic beta as far as i understood. My p server has 2-5min or smth. The mobs in the castle didnt respawn while i was in but outside they respawned quite quickly so that i couldnt even kill half of them until the others respawned.
---
Are all generals female ?
---
Sunstrider or Twisting Nether (did a server change and cant remember if it was before or after) EU. Started playing after school at around 6pm joined an active. Went to sleep around 3am, went to school, back home and playing around 6pm same AV, went to sleep again around 3, still the same damn av. Being a Wednesday i was home around 1pm, rejoined THE SAME AV and eventually won somewhere in the afternoon. i will never forget that one, that is, and probably will forever be the most memorable gaming highlight of my life.
---
Maybe even before the beta ends
---
Wow, I played WoW Beta too because I was subscribed to fileplanet ... memories...
---
That would suck. Making alts is fun
---
I'm already waiting for the grey shoulders and hats to be collecting dust on AH for 100g because greedy fucks don't know how poor everyone is
---
&gt;Had Blizz just left WoW alone and launched "World of Warcraft, LFG Lobby Edition" I think that would have been well received.
---
So true....
---
They are more examples they a definitive list. Training costs quite a bit, from class training, to professions, and then your 40 and 60 training/mount combo. Flight paths are also a money sink, repairing may not SEEM like a lot, but they add up if you track your repair bills.
---
I remember being money starved all through classic (mostly because I was young and dumb)
---
I kind of wish you had to take a test in order to play a rogue.
---
You just have to be able to spell rogue.
---
No
---
Yes, we can assume that raw gold farming is king at least the first 4 to 6 weeks. Given that money, these guys will start playing the auction house... Will be interesting!
---
I had a terrible PC when I first started playing Wow. 
---
So tanking wasn't really a thing I was able to do consistantly on the low FPS I was getting and the ping I was getting playing a NA server from Australia. 
---
After upgrading around lvl 40 I was able to try and do it better and ended up being the OT in our guild through Vanilla.
---
I'm expecting the opposite where everything is going to be dummy expensive because scalpers are gonna come in trying to charge dozens of gold for little shit and nobody will be able to afford it. 
---
And all the cheap stuff will get bought and resold.
---
I'd say outside of the bad revamped talent system, Mists of Pandaria had the best class design.
---
I played as a ret paladin the entire time.
---
Unprepared people, with average-to-t2 gear without a way to break CC cannot beat a rogue who blows every cooldown, then preps and blows them again. You can guarantee between 2 and 3k damage from the static Cold Blood Eviscerates ALONE, coupled with at least a minute of uniterrupted CC.
---
For example, another rogue in Bloodfang will have roooughly 4k health. And you can expect your eviscerates alone to do 3k to him. So you "just" need to find an additional 1k, which isn't too hard, even with a level 1 dagger.
---
Careful, those might also be gold sellers transferring money around. Especially on the neutral AH.
---
That's an interesting way to write that you have no friends
---
Anyone know if questie and questing guide will be updated on release?
---
Sure thing, just wanted to offer clarification where I could. You're doing excellent work, keep it up!
---
No Dwarf Warlocks.
---
Most people expect Rag to fall on the 1st ID. A few groups are aiming for that. They’re very confident. If they don’t down him til the 2nd ID, they’ll consider it a major failure.
---
In 2-3 years, the players that want Vanilla-only will be in the minority. They should take the burden of transferring or re-rolling.
---
Humans are animals too
---
Here is some examples why TBC started to take the wrong path :
---
 
---
* The amount of [experience](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Experience) needed to gain a level has been decreased between levels 20 and 60. In addition, the amount of experience granted by [quests](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest) has been increased between levels 30 and 60.
---
* Level 1-60 dungeon quests have had their experience and faction rewards increased.
---
* Many elite creatures and quests in the level 1-60 experience have been changed to accommodate solo play.
---
* Vendor Discounts: All vendors with an associate faction now give discounts at all levels above [neutral](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Neutral)
---
* All Commanders and Lieutenants have left Alterac Valley in search for other battle opportunities.
---
* The Horde and Alliance now have a limited number of reinforcements available in the battle for Alterac Valley.
---
* The Requirement for [Heroic](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_mode) Keys has been lowered to [honored](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honored).
---
* Raid attunement remove
---
Etc...
---

---
Mechanic testing fights in Mara??????
---
I don't think it's in Blizzard's best interests to advertise for the streamers in this way.
---
Sites like wowhead, this subreddit, etc will almost certainly keep tabs on which realms host which communities. I think it's best if the community polices itself. 1000% this subreddit will have an "AVOID THESE REALMS" meta thread.
---
I'm not opposed to it. It's kind of a weird change though: A Change to make the game "feel" like nothing changed.
---
Which can bring you to either end of that spectrum :)
---
About this part:
---
&gt; The second encounter had an even smaller sample size but Asmon took an avarage of 151.5 damage in comparison with the rogue's 148.125 avarage damage taken so if anything Arugal hits HARDER on the beta but that i must attribute to variance in the low sample size. 
---
To even further prove the point, you could fairly argue that difference is from Asmongold having 29 less Armor than the Rogue.  Yeah, 29 Armor is practically nothing, but so is that difference.
---
Classic Challenge:  Play 1 - 60 with this resolution.
---
Honestly TBC was a great expansion when it comes to PvP. It introduced the Arena and actually had decent balance , with resilience, gems and mix between PvE Gear.
---
You see, this makes me tempted to roll a warrior more than opposed to it. I’d rather be the tank, knowing I know why I’m doing, that count on some rando who may or may not be an idiot. That said, I leveled a warrior early bc and it was excruciating so I’m probably playin a warlock.
---
You know words are just words right? Like, saying fuck is the same as saying shoot or crap... they’re all just a mix of words, they mean nothing unless you give them meaning, which is super unintelligent to do, as avian, they’re just words.
---
dude you need to take a chill pill
---
It's not a joystick, it's just 4 to 8 extra buttons. Keypads are LITERALLY easier to use and while having the exact same functions.
---
Yes, it does. Shaman enhancements just don't stack with other temporary buffs like sharpening or weight stones, rogue poisons, and wizard oils.
---
So... we've definitely had our disagreements.... 
---
About that list....
---
*opens my blouse a bit more*
---
Oh yeah my dad works for Nintendo and said you can get Thrall in Smash Bros
---
Except we'll all be choosing our realms 2 weeks before launch and a lot of streamers have pledged they intend to hide their chosen realm from the public.
---
Mostly dumb
---
I think one could argue that having a 1hr wait on AH mail would encourage players to actually find a reliable crafter for items that they need rather than farming gold and buying it from an anonymous person that they never meet.
---
It's kind of tough to tell what is "essential to the vanilla experience" and what is "just inconvenience".
---
You mean ESDF right?  Yeah, I have those on my thumb.  And it's a 8-way mechanical hat switch, not a joystick.
---

Why would they? Blizzard added name reservations to address this.

Once influencers reserve their name -- they have no reason not to announce the realm.

---
People still watch Towelliee?
---
This is a basic search function, so here's another thing people might not know: If you use quotation marks, it'll attempt to search for videos with only the exact phrase in the quotation marks.  This can be good for trying to find a specific video when you remember only some of the title.  I think by default Google/Youtube tries to search like this, but quotation marks can sometimes change search results for the better.
---
Mechanically better, yes, no doubt about that.
---
But fight mechanics are the smallest part of what makes up Classic. Preparation, socialization, getting gear in the first place, consumables, gold. Leveling in fact. Those are the hard parts, and each of them is more difficult than Retail.
---
The problem with most peoples perception of "difficulty" is, they only evaluate the only difficulty that has been left in current WoW...which is fight mechanics. There is nothing else left, it's not an RPG, it's a raid simulator, with a thin veneer of a game around it.
---
People who only look for a mechanical challenge should stay clear of classic, they won't get satisfied. That is not me gatekeeping, that is setting realistic expactations of what the game can deliver, and what it cannot.
---
I agree those threads will come up, but there are a lot of people that will be going in relatively blind, not having read reddit or the forums. I feel like some forewarning should be available that the gameplay experience on streamer heavy realms will be significantly different than most others.
---
Retail players watch towelliee 
---
Classic players watch him get rolled
---
Yeah like he has zero say in how his own content is published
---
&gt; Once influencers reserve their name -- they have no reason not to announce the realm.
---
Sure they do, if a ton of people plan on avoiding their realms, especially hardcore players, they don't want people to know their realm for as long as possible.
---
Speed matters more than that, since attack power scaling differs with weapon speed. 
---
X (I don't remember the exact number) amount of AP will always give you 1DPS. Since the AP has to give you that DPS it would give on average 4 extra damage on a 4.0 speed weapon, and 2 extra on a 2.0 speed weapon.
---
So with hypothetically identic top and bottom end damages between a 3.0 weapon and a 4.0 weapon, you would still see higher average hits on a 4.0, although your DPS would overall be lower.
---
Yes, that would be the clicks outlined above.
---
I feel like I'm in the opposite position from most people. When WoW initially came out I'd just turned 21, struggling through school, financially, &amp; had zero time. Loved it but never made it to 60 and had to quit before BC due to time constraints. Now I'm in my mid-30s, half retired, own my home &amp; have no kids, only a fiance who will also be playing classic. I have more time now than I did at the initial release,  I just hope I can get the same enjoyment out of it you all did 15 years ago. I haven't experienced a community driven MMO since SWG, and coming from games like DAoC &amp; EQ1 I'm craving it, &amp; can't wait for August.
---
There are more character slots than just one, you know.
---
Not enough cowbell!
---
If you're talking about the Kargoz guides, yeah.  One of the top comments in the original post warns about his rogue/warrior/paladin guides for exactly that reason.

I decided to keep them in because (1) most of the information that he uses is correct, and (2) the warning is there, so people know to not take that part of the guide seriously.  Also, his non-melee guides are some of the highest quality out there, and I didn't want to throw them all out because he had one piece of bad information.
---
No problem, thank you for linking this post in the other thread
---
I don't expect Blizzard to, but there are ways. Either way, as I said in the OP, it should be self enforcing.
---
After more than a week capped at level 30, of course he is unrealistically overgeared for a level 30. But at one point he was a fresh level 30 with same gear as anyone else or doing dungeons that he was under leveled and under geared for. He was still pulling multiple packs with little to no difficulty. 
---
I'm not saying vanilla was ever hard, but it did punish mistakes and required you to take your time with pulls. The Beta does not.
---
While leveling, healers should only be using max rank heals as they don't have any +healing to increase of the efficiency of lower ranked heals. I also think you are vastly underestimating peoples ability to do basic addition. I don't think it would have been too hard to figure out that a heal that heals for up to 60 health, you should wait until the person is missing atleast 60 health to use. I guess you could argue that people weren't healing around the Five-second rule back then like they should be, but healers in the Beta aren't either.
---
Best thing about TBC : i can at last create a beautiful female horde character 
---
Worst thing about TBC : old Azeroth become ghost town
---
Everquest does it just fine, they probably have like 5% of the budget Blizzard does
---
Because you’re assuming that everyone would use those addons but that’s not necessarily the case. By not making any changes it gives people more options; they can fine-tune how authentic their vanilla experience is by choosing whether or not to use the addons.
---
I felt that TBC was a great leap for WoWkind in the wrong direction. It would be really cool to see the player base form a consensus that it should either be heavily modified to better reflect the original philosophies or a new, appropriate expansion should replace it.
---
The classic hype killed ESO for me, and thats with fresh expansion out
---
Its more like other way around, classic being ESO killer
---
Pandas have been part of warcraft lore wayyyy before mop... They were in wc3
---
Thank you for explaining that for me. Really great write up, I appreciate it.
---
I’ve heard that there is a popular leather set (devilsaur?) at later levels that is BiS for a bit, is this true?
---
Oh my dude, amazing work!
---
Very true. It's so difficult to predict how any change will affect the game long term. With WoW or any great game there's always going to be a certain level of success achieved that wasn't even intended but once you have created something really great you have to be really careful anytime any change is made.
---
And this is why X-realm BGs are bad =( I can understand if they match 2 servers together if one has 60% alliance and the other 60% horde, just to lower the queues from 1 hour to 5 minutes for everyone.
---
But battlegroups with a lot of servers ruined the PvP community =(
---
I dunno, I raided through BWL and half of AQ40. I was in college and at one point the amount of time it took to be a dedicated raider, it became less of a video game and more of a part time job. 
---
When I didn’t know any better, someone rocking that gear was a badass to me. When I started raiding, I almost pitied them know what it takes to get there. 
---
Those days of wow are some of my fondest, and it’s why I can’t wait to play classic, but it was definitely work.
---
Since it's 1.12 AV, they will. It's when the zerg really started.
---
been playing WOW for 13 years, never received a single beta invite.
---
its been years since i no longer give a damn about receiving a beta invite.
---
That's not true. Blizzard added flying mounts because they thought they'd be cool at the time, I also think it was in response to a new MMO coming out, Vanguard Saga of Heroes, which had flying mounts, but they didn't intend to destroy world PVP, but that's what happened.
---
Why are people downvoting this, its a joke
---
Yep, and there are people who use their thumb for abilities rather than movement.  Like [Swifty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbROdKu3TGA).
---
Tell me, when did average people start feeling threatened by every sign of intellect around them?
---
As an Alliance Dota 2 fan it's always nice to see Alliance Wins, unfortunetly it doesn't happen that often anymore =(
---
Just look at GoT season 8! Plenty of bad writing to be seen and enjoyed!
---
I liked having to chose between traveling to trade an item and sending it by mail for an hour. It increased the immersion IMO
---
Same. I got to see some level 60 before BC dropped, but I do remember getting some blue cloak from ZG and getting hyped over it. Lots of PUGs on my server to the end.
---
He's saying WoW had complete market control of the MMORPG genre, and it's true, just as LOL mostly has market control of MOBAs but at the same time idk if WoW even had a DOTA 2 like competitor to compete with.
---
Am I crazy?
---
I still remember needing a group of ppl to take down each tower mini-boss in TBC AV. I still remember patrols being an issue and while you had a main force that stayed together as they moved up the map taking towers as they went you still had options to back cap if previous towers were left un-defended or under-defended.
---
I never played AV before TBC, but it wasn't until later in TBC that the full zerg was possible when the mini-bosses at each tower and more patrols were removed.
---
Indeed, Auto Shot has an invisible 0.5 sec cast time, though it fires automatically (hence the name) and just keeps trying to cast as soon as you stop moving again.  In fact, all the shots' cast time that had one are invisible in Classic if I remember correctly, even Aimed Shot's 3 second cast time, which I disliked even back then.  Multi-Shot also has a 0.5 cast time, which is something databases don't pick up for some reason.  Volley's channelling bar actually does show up in Classic, if I remember correctly, but that's different of course.
---
I just hope Classic will be as fun as private server were.
---
Wow, what an outrageous overreaction to a joke. I guess it's a sensitive subject for you.
---
Anyways, I don't know why you're getting so aggravated. No one leveled "healer spec" as a Priest because it makes no sense. You don't heal any better by dumping points in Holy as you do with the standard leveling spec (which only really needs two talents to function). You also don't level slower going deep holy until the 45+ range, assuming you get the leveling talents. If you're talking about leveling without Spirit Tap and Wand Spec and using Smite or some stupid shit like that, it would be significantly slower than a 5. 
---
It's a shitty, poorly written guide. You don't have to jump through hoops to defend his lazy "rankings."
---
Only if it's free to transfer would that be an acceptable option.
---
The ‘evidence’ you provided was not clear at all. He literally says “we *try* to keep you in the same layer” - this needs to be clarified.
---
how about posting that in the asmongold reddit?  
---
or do you like beeing downvoted into oblivion?
---
...Yeah, you try that...
---
Yes this will be a huge problem again once people come to realize that they simply picked an underperforming class with one viable spec for endgame.
---
I mean just the set bonuses from gear tell how the game wants you to play.
---
As you mentioned enhancement shamans there's also elemental shaman, balance druid, ret and prot paladin, disc and shadow priest, survival hunter and I think warlocks only had destruction as a viable spec...
---
There are just so many talent trees completely useless and when OP said "I can't remember having a mana tide totem shaman in my group" is because he was the mana tide totem as a druid, priests were the ones grouped with shamans for mana tide because they were the best healers by far.
---
Or no transfer at all.
---
Pretty sure he's also missing a finger.
---
At least it's clean?
---
There was actual pvp!
---
(My, horde side, view) Usually it was like this: AV started, everyone ran to the field to start slaughtering alliance, then after the initial clash and battle over the middle graveyard, the battles shifted over to belinda/whatever ours was. (AV was 51-60) lower lvl players then went to the wolves to tame em and the rams to kill them (for the wolf rider NPC’s). The higher levels would then rage because there weren’t enough people on the front lines. Every player kill would drop materials that could be turned in to improve the armor/dmg/life of npc’s. 
---
The battles where a constant back and forth, killing belinda, or stealth capping a graveyard where HUGE accomplishments, because that meant we could gain many, many centimetres (hehe) of ground. 
---
The reason of this was, rushing as a 40man raid past the towers and all npc’s would probably get everyone killed, there where many patrols, tower npc’s, mobs (wolves/rams) all of which respawned. All pretty high level aswell. 
---
The need for special tactics, stealthcapping, timing the huge boss elemental with the wolf riders and bat riders so you’d get a triple npc wave with the raidpush. Capping towers with a group (did the towers change alliance? Or where they destroyed like in retail?)
---
It was amazing!
---
I have...That's what I was describing in my comment, to a lesser degree maybe but still overcluttered.
---
Compare it to https://classicdb.ch/
---
It's more reminiscent of the clean thottbot approach
---
What does "they must" mean? P servers are here and have players for over 10 years now, and there are tons of classic games that are still played. I mean, eventually the earth will also not be here. I'ts virtually impossible for a game like vanilla WoW to drop into unplayable levels even without a single addition.
---
Happy birthday dude
---
You speak for yourself.
---
You have no clue how weed works on people.
---
&gt; I’d be interested in a poll done that required some level of proof for boss kills. 
---
How would anyone even prove that after almost 15 years? I started in 2004 and killed twin emps and like 5-6 bosses in Naxx before BC dropped, but I can't think of any way I could prove it.
---
Dota 2 International Battle Pass lasts until the 26th of August, so it's perfect to play up until the release of Classic!
---
Money dude
---
Really can’t handle all the streamer propaganda in here anymore.  I never thought I’d see another subreddit make r/livestreamfails look less autistic but here we are.
---
Back in 2006 we got one guy on our server who reached the Goldcap. He used World of Warcraft as an economy simulator for his master thesis.
---
The economy of WoW evolved as soon as TBC started. With flying Mounts, farming was way easier. Juwelcrafting was a very profitable profession. You can farm mats while flying and everyone needed so many of these gems.
---
Before TBC having more than 1k Gold and already the 100% mount was very unique. It was more likely that you were broke.
---
I just learned the hard way that you shouldn’t joke about Classic 😉 people just don’t have humor
---
spec tier choices, i know back in vanilla classes were  supposed to have a specific role(kinda like FF xiv) but it would be nice to be able to use any spec while raiding.
---
Cool! What kind of font are you using for these icons? Great work!
---
Didn't vanilla not have oceanic servers? I hope they come up with something cool for us Aussies
---
They mentioned in early interviews that each continent is it's own layer and they can generate new continent layers dynamically. If that's still the case I don't see why they would't keep one of each continent layer up so that's a 7k player cap per server.
---
I loved skating... But I don't think this counts as a bug, as the original animation was considered a bug/oversight iirc.
---
No I started in WoD
---
I remember grinding for hours for those darn Pristine Yeti Horn in Winterspring.
---
Yes take a risk with Classic+ (OSTS) instead of releasing something that equal amount of people love just as much as Vanilla. This is the problem with these threads, this RIGHT HERE. Everyone and their opinions on what should or shouldn't be,
---
Man i hope blizzard waves the middle finger to every single suggestion people make.
---
In PvP it's pretty bad.
---
Thank you for actually answering the question. All the other comments are people just repeating the same joke that the OP is asking about.
---
Classic WoW was never fucking hard. Who the hell remembers it as being hard. The raid/dungeon mechanics where pathetic at best.
---
There was no raid difficulty until AQ/NAX .
---
Wow Classic it was painfully slow gearing process and a time sync across the board that i personally dread going back into. Remember the Onyxia attunement????  
---
It was however fucking difficult having 40 people show up for raids and being able to follow a simple start.
---
Most of the players had no idea about rotations, situational awareness and how to even turn. 
---
Any BFA WoW decent player is probably better then 90% of all player base in wow classic.
---
With that being said I want to raid with a good guild and wipe my ass with the content and i sure as hell want to enjoy doing pvp with a group of people because for me that is what Wow Classic was about.
---
The dude who killed him was named Froggie. Coincidence? I think not!
---
&gt;asmon is lvl 25 in his sfk 
---
And SFK is designed for players in the range between level 20-24 [(source)](https://classic.wowhead.com/shadowfang-keep), so he already outlevels the dungeon. 2 players in his group are higher level than him.
---
At the level of his group, I did Scarlet Monastery in Vanilla.
---
&gt;Private servers are overtuned to compensate for players having 15 years of experience and knowledge.
---
As it turns out by the complaints of the last weeks, no, most of them were not, in fact they were undertuned in many aspects (droprates, respawn rates, etc).
---
&gt;Dont be surprised to see groups chainpulling in instances and raids
---
We were chainpulling back in Vanilla. What's your point?
---
Ahh yes, the "internet didn't exist in 2004" argument.
---
You have saved my YouTube searches! Thank you!
---
I stopped playing BFA as soon as I decided to play this again :)
---
I was only farming mounts anyway.
---
Yeah, what the Hell?
---
looks &gt; performance
---
fiery &gt; everything else. even in MC and BWL. for casters too.
---
Sorry, what was that? I couldn't quite hear you all the way down there.
---
Cuz smh dying in 1v3 or 1v4 not having your CD while leveling isn't enough for you ?
---
Here he is everybody. The man we've all been waiting for. Mr. Buzzkillington himself in the flesh. 
---
It's a pvp clip, and a good one for that matter. You don't causally have 2v7's happen everyday and for it to be between two groups of popular streamers makes it even more rare. Chill brah
---
Been playing since launch and never made 1 female character. Love me some women, but I don't want to run around as a girl in the game. My immersion would be ruined.
---
Meta unlocked
---
Moderately annoying.
---
okay the average damage numbers aren't very far apart. PoD has a strong proc which can also proc off windfury.
---
you don't need to play devil's advocate. the twink community has already debated this to death and everyone uses PoD.
---
B-BUT THEY WERE DOING IT AT LEVEL 30 AND THEY WERENT GETTING REKT BY LEVEL 19 MOBS ELITE DAMAGE IS UNDERTUNED
---
”Better” is not the right word. If you want the class mount specifically then no, it’s not better. I think ”cheaper” is what you’re looking for.
---
Why does the shield he drops look different from the shield that he wields? How many shields does he have?
---
I used to be in a top world guild a couple expansions ago, it's true that your guild can provide a great community experience but it's still boring doing anything out in the world and on top of that they've really screwed up class design since Ghostcrawler left that it does affect your enjoyment in raids.
---
Thanks mate that's helpful, i guess there will be so many mages that getting into raids might not be as easy either.
---
Is priest the best healer for pvp as well on horde side?
---
Try using StartIsBack
---
I wouldn't run a shadowpriest on the horde side and cut down the warlock spots to 3. You can add one more hunter and two more offtanks in their place.
---
Maybe cut down the rogue spots to 5 and add a seventh mage.
---
I'd run with 5 shamans and 2 druids.
---
And RP-PVP :D
---
actually it makes a lot of difference due to the way gear stats work.
---
Your average leveling character can struggle because their gear is all over the place in terms of stats, sometimes 10 levels lower than they are. Where as Asmonds crew are mostly running around in level 36+ gear (or blues with level 35-38 stat budgets).
---
The streamers were twinked to the teeth, pretty much 29 twink+ some stuff that opened up at level 30, AND respec'd specifically to customize their talents for maximum effect.
---
Gear-wise they're about 37 in terms of mitigation stats, so the only real difference is that they have a high miss chance and get crit 2% more often and have a high chance of crushing blows (which actually works against the enemy because having such a high CB chance makes it easier to push off the attack table with Shield block).
---
The hunters were also doing good work with the kiting to keep the pressure manageable (and were the MVPs since there's fewer defense stats to counter physical ranged dps, it was basically just dodges and misses they had to worry about).
---
you're right, it's 15 sec. thanks
---
As you can see in my other comment I was referring to vanilla content not BFA.
---
which race you prefer in WOW
---
Not like TBC? I pick it over WOTLK slim but I do
---
Warlocks were amazing in MoP. I played Fury Warrior and not only myself but people who played other specs that had Fury Warrior alts thought it was one of the best designed specs Blizzard ever created. Then they got rid of all heroic strike, stances, most rage management, colossus smash and it neutered a lot of the complexity.
---
Words can’t describe how hype I am that the release is on my birthday this year. Give me all the adderall and bring back gamer fuel baby!
---
Honestly, I hate WoWhead. The layout for quests, items, spells is terrible. Its often times difficult to find what you're looking for. Sometimes there's missing information. The whole site design is just overblown and its trying to do too much.
---
Thotbot was simple, streamlined, and concise. It took seconds to find what you were looking for. I miss it.
---
It was all raiders that wanted to also, none of the officers were even thinking of switching from DKP as we had always done that.
---
Wow, this is a really comprehensive list. Was surprised to see the guide from my old LEGION guidly Sheina in the rogue section. Greetings from Somebody if any of you LEGION guys are still around.
---
Any Turkish guilds recruiting?
---
Yeah, here is the thing:
---
I don't subscribe to the whole "political correctness", "always be nice", "don't offend anyone", "don't trigger anyone" - mindset of this day and age.
---
I grew up in a time when people weren't "offended" by whatever they decide they currently don't agree with, and when famous or pseudofamous people, or their fans, didn't swoon whenever their idol wasn't displayed in only the most favorable light.
---
And I carry the spirit of that time with me, and will continue to do so. If I want to use someone as an example for better effect of what I am saying, I will do so.
---
Don’t you only need 4 hooves?
---
Nah, FFXIV: Shadowbringers is only a month away, plus its preview embargo gets lifted in just a few hours. Unless the balancing is drastically different, I should have ShB's 1st (Savage) raid tier on farm by the time Classic launches.
---
Ah interesting thanks. I didn't realize AP worked like that.
---
Following for Info on this as well
---
Wait you wanna tell me they made classic easier? Wtf blizzard.
---
Sorry, I don't know what's causing the issues and I have no solution. :&lt;
---
You can replace "-Asmongold" with any other word you want to filter to make more precise youtube (and google) searches. I was just using the name as an example.
---
... *that’s* what “kills your immersion”??
---
&gt; on the 1st ID
---
How would that work? Assuming the game launches at a weekly reset (and not on thursday like most launches), you have 7 days \played to actually down rag.
---
Leveling in Classic seems about 15% slower 1-30 for most people trying routes now. This gives level 60 times of 4 1/2 to 5 days if you solo level hunters after Joana's guide and manage to be ahead of the pack. If you level in groups of 2-3, I don't think you can beat that time. So 5 days \played to get to 60 seems reasonable.
---
You need ~35 characters playing in shifts by people so you can have a  raid at level 60 by the start of the 6th day. Then you need to gear for about 6-10 hours (might be doable if you are really efficient and know what you go for) before you can start putting in tries.
---
That leaves a total of ~40 hours to down Rag from first stepping into the instance. It's not impossible. But the amount of time and coordination required exceeds the mythic world 1st kills for Legion and BfA right now. I'll be the first to applaud a group that pulls it off. But it's **very** tight and stuff going wrong even in the slightest (like servers being down for more than cumulative 2 hours over the first week) can fuck it up.
---
Do you have closer connections to groups that actually try this?
---
&gt;Honestly TBC was a great expansion when it comes to PvP.
---
You mean that 80/20 H/A ratio?
---
arenas are trash, wpvp is fun. And there is no room for wpvp in TBC
---
I never gave a damn what gender my character is. Also had both genders randomly. I don’t understand why anyone would consider gender unless you’re roleplaying
---
he lost like 15 times in a row against guzu (rogue).... he can't do anything beside screaming in the microphone....
---
Luckily, you are not my physician (or anyones physician).
---
Living it to its fullest. Wtf kind of question was that?
---
&gt;Yes take a risk with Classic+ (OSRS) instead of releasing something that equal amount of people love just as much as Vanilla.
---
As far as I am concerned, taking a risk for a better game is better than guaranteeing its downfall with TBC.
---
I’m pretty sure the blue tier competes with AQ 40 gear or just shy, scaling was different back in classic. So old gear was still relevant.
---
I love Alts tho
---
The opening event = the 6 hour opening event. Not the quest line. Every mob you killed during the opening gave rep, and if you killed one of the collossi you got even more from a quest turnin.   
---
On EU-Dragonblight the gate was opened at midnight on a weekday, and we had a raid playing through the night. In the morning - at the end of the event - I collected the exalted ring. Called in sick for work. I was young.  
---
I think I have some screenshots at home detailing it, though only the file created timestamps would corroborate what I'm saying - and those timestamps are spoofable.
---
Because an MMO that looks like that would break down the moment there are more than 10 players on screen.
---
Go post this on the wow reddit not here. We are not the ones you need to remind to have "community" good try young nugget.
---
If the game doesn't drop in population, then layers aren't going anywhere.  Blizzard is completely assuming that the pop is going to go way down after a while.  
---
They might be right... but what if it doesn't?
---
Early on mining, skinning, and herbalism will be the best way to make money. This is fairly true at higher levels as well.  People need their mats at any level and you’ll sometimes find a niche where mid tier mats sell for more than max level mats, making farming easier since mobs are less likely to attack and your risk of being ganked in a lower level area is lower. 
---
Herb/Alchemy is a great money maker end game. Raiders and PVP players will be sinking money into pots through the life of the game, and there are a few pots like invisibility potions that people like to use for MC Atunement that you ca. Gouge.   There is also the added benefit of being able to sell your wares in the AH so you don’t actively have to be selling yourself. 
---
Enchanting can make good coin later on, especially if you get some of the rarer enchants like crusader. A drawback in Vanilla is you can’t sell your enchants on the AH like you can now, so it’s something you have to actively pursue/advertise. If your time is short it’s not the best. 
---
Tailoring is sort of a fun one since bags are always in demand and it’s a profession where your farming resource (mobs) also helps level you up.  It’s nice to pair it with a gathering profession like mining or herb to make money as you go. IMHO it compliments enchanting best since you will be making a lot of garbage gear to level up which you can then disenchant.
---
Rogue for me if that was the choice, as you said the choice. I played vanilla and I believe I got rank 10 but that's it. I was a rogue and I had a full time job at the time and went to the police academy thereafter.
---
I'm on this school too
---
I think people really don't understand how mechanics become normalized as time goes by. If we take really old mmorpgs like Everquest or FFXI, the latter of which I came from as a hardcore player myself even, the majority of fights were literally just tank and spank. The most basic shit. It relied solely on having the proper gear, being able to manage mana so you don't run out and some basic mechanics like timing your attacks with each other to make chains if necessary. Hell, MOST of the fight as a melee dps was literally autoattacking.
---
In comes WoW, EVERYONE and their mother can tank and spank now, that shit is bog standard. So WoW evolved those mechanics. Now bosses have adds and you have to kite them away and CC or kill them. The raid kind of has to split dps between two mobs at a time, or stop dpsing in a certain phase etc. Once again, extremely basic shit now days, but back then, cutting edge shit.
---
Now cut to modern mmos and retail. Those raid mechanics that caused so many Vanilla wipes, pulling adds away, split dps etc.? That's like starter dungeon shit now. Someone types it in chat right before the boss in case new people are there and people kill the dungeon boss their first try. Are they god tier raiders ready to hit end game now and start raiding? Absolutely not, they are just used to those NOW old/basic mechanics.
---
I'm not saying people won't wipe to MC. The truth is you will have casual social guilds that just don't give a fuck and won't even look mechanics up. They will pull fucking Garr, AoE everything and all get blown the fuck up instantly. It will be fucking hilarious if anyone records it, but then they will look up the fight and go "Oh, lol. Mechanics." and probably one-shot it next pull.
---
Vanilla WoW is FUN to a lot of people. Their design philosophy of slower, more thought out combat is something people miss. When we go back we will love the fuck out of it for a while, but it won't be hard. We won't really struggle through much. We will just laugh and kill shit with our old and new friends as we rapidly (in comparison to vanilla) progress through the content.
---
It is called cost cutting.  They don't want to hire more employees to do the job. 
---
Shall I remind everyone that Activision Blizzard fired 800~ people this year?

No, the WASD layout. The layout that every decent WoW player uses. If your setup was superior then it would be used by good players, but it's not.
---
It's just bad advice to tell someone to buy a gimmicky piece of hardware for a game they've just started playing. If your point is "it's good enough" for WoW, then WASD is also "good enough".
---
Yeah, I played the RTS games since the original. It always seemed a bit weird to pick a non-green. The only non-green Orcs I recall were the Fel Orcs who were red/brownish.
---
There is always demand for tanks, no matter how much you hear about people saying they are rolling tanks. Don't worry about it, just play what you want and the rest will follow, especially if you are living PUG life, always room for more in that scene.
---
The question just screamed Huntard to me.
---
i guess you didn't watched the video cause skarm himself said this is not a build for early game :)
---
it's definitely not fucking easier to do a heavy tps build in pre raid/T1 gear MC, lol. just goes to show your lack of knowledge
---
also, [good luck popping all of these](https://youtu.be/XutoehG6ZaQ)
---
this is the 1% of the 1% of the 1%, it's not a accurate representation of what classic will be for the majority of the population
---
It would because I'm male, it's just me. Not judging those that play females.
---
That’s what it does for me. Leave it for a couple of hours and it takes up al the memory and hangs up. On linux anyway.
---
The longer it’s out the more PuG MC/BWL/ZG/Ony/AQ will happen so it’s feasible if you’re going to be casual.
---
By the time you hit 60 and get pre raid BiS I’d say some pugs will start forming.
---
YouTube stores your watch history tied to your account, not cookies; you have to delete your watched history on YouTube if you are signed in.

I guess screenshots of characters with loot obtained from various bosses... yeah, pretty unrealistic. It would be interesting though.
---
experience, unlike the OP
---
Easier than it was when vanilla was live? No they didn't. Easier than pservers that are missing a lot of data? Possibly.
---
What do you mean he wasn't invited to this one? Did they remove the stress test from he acount or what?
---
Whatever it is you're taking, take less.
---
TBC was the best thing ever happened to wow after classic. As other people mentioned: PvP was great, it had arenas, it was balanced. You could finally have a tier set for each spec. The raids were actually hard. It was great.
---
Without the group the Skinner would never make a Beast kill. Roll for it like you would anything else in the dungeon.
---
In current bfa you can use elemental force to achieve the same effect while leveling the early levels and it works for casters which is a neat +
---
Could it be a layering problem? Ie. you are actually moved to a different layer without realising, and that layer happens to have all the mobs.
---
I played starting from the beta with a level 50 cap through to about a month before BC due to time constraints.  I'm so excited for August bc I actually have more time in my mid-30s than I did in my early 20s to play. Haven't experienced a good community driven MMO to the fullest since SWG, hoping to get that experience with WoW classic again now that I have time for it.
---
We don't all want that though.
---
I don't get why some people don't understand that a lot of people just want the game exactly as it was, including this.
---
people know that the raids will be easy, they were literally created 15 years ago. people are discussing whether or not the raids should be buffed so they are numerically harder - this could in turn just mean bosses require your raid to be more geared and not necessarily skilled.
---
&gt; 1.12 pvp blues
---
The bad news is that obtaining these blues is a bigger commitment than raiding in the whole game for the most part. The good ones is that there are guilds which are absolutely fine with rotating roster players as long as you can say whether you're coming today or not.
---
;-)
---
Is there a chance to have a look at your list? My plan is to farm for the Crusader enchantment and for the mats to make some gold for the tomes...It's not a good plan if I remember correctly how to get everything...
---
Fortunately I'm moving house this Friday and will have the the new home keeping me busy till August. Out of curiousity how many EU players in this subreddit?
---
0.1% in vanilla...1000+runs on 3 pserver never saw it. Gl with farming.
---
Contrary to what many on this subreddit keep saying... the only real reason for layering/sharding is to cost cut.  Less servers and server maintenance guys. 
---
Loot trading and right click reporting/automated punishment is also cutting back on GMs.  
---
This is a corporation we are talking about.. so many people seem to think they give a crap about us, but they don't.  It is all about shareholder investments and they themselves admit every quarter at their shareholder meetings.. especially the beginning of this year's where Activision Blizzard fired 800~ employees despite their departments actually making money.
---
I’m ready. I got to level 10 today!! 
---
I’m still learning how to use the keys though. Selling  items and equipping new gear. 
---
We are already writing down what snacks and drinks we are getting for classic release. :) 
---
I’m really excited because I’ve always wanted to become a streamer. So maybe I’ll be able to tap into twitch streaming if I can get decent at using a keyboard.
---
Oh really? Do tell!  
---
My, it's almost as if I had a reason to put this...
---
&gt;Of course, this only works if you don't log into Youtube :P
---
...in my above post. Thanks for sharing your amazing insight. You are truly a sage among men.
---
At a certain point, it just becomes obnoxious. After awhile, I just skipped over the rest of his post because it feels like it was written by an emotional teenager who seems irrationally upset just from thinking about TBC.
---
You know there are other versions than 2.3? TBC was the pinnacle of WoW and no, it couldn't have been a better expansion because everything that followed was worse.
---

---
The one you linked.
---
Ok
---
I wouldn't call it Nuisance, but I was also our guilds skinner and got that shit for free! :D
---
How is it balanced?
---
Hunters and warlocks are OP, alliance is not even a faction. PvP was dogshit, and resilience was a mistake. 
---
Just because TBC is not as awful as wrath doesn't make it good.
---
thriving
---
Many people will swear by both races as being the best. Me, I have a slight inclination for thinking orc is best, but it's really close. Since it's so close, I think you should pick whichever you think looks the best.
---
What you should consider is another casual whose down to duo leveling with you. Hmu on discord 007#1267 but only if ur PST/NAwest (alliance)
---
Always 6 for me
---
nerfed on private servers or?
---
This is so 2000 it resurrected O-zone
---
Do you also only have human characters?
---
Blizzard chose the most retarded way to introduce expansions, which was making everything that was released before the new expansion irrelevant. TBC started it and made the whole of Azeroth irrelevant outside of leveling characters and professions.
---
Streamers bad reeeee
---
Bunch of neckbeards and kids holy fuck. No im not an asmon fanboy or smth. Just dont get why you folks get triggered as soon as you see the word streamer.
---
Those people hype classic and draw lots of people to the game in the first place.
---
They're paranoid about power creep, so lots of content gets rejected, but crab memes aside there's been a pretty big power creep from where they started. Their polling system is far from perfect. Don't get me wrong, OSRS is still a great game, but it's not static
---
Look we all know why you people play rogues. So the only racial that matters is cannibalize !
---
this was a thing when theyy reworked guilds in cata i think.
---
guildbanks dont exist in classic so no tax here
---
Thats exactly what this pic is saying
---
Thanks, i enjoy looking!
---
Those goalposts aren’t gonna move themselves man.
---
I learned how to tank by being a healer and watching how all the classes worked.
---
My first character was a warrior and boy...did I suck at tanking. I was clueless(as were all my friends)
---
I’m no expert on these things at all but as far as I know the reason games in general can’t look as good as cinematics is pure computational horsepower needed to render the highly detailed scenes. 
---
You watch a 2 minute cinematic play out in real time. Actually that cinematic is built by one or more computers over many hours of rendering frame by frame. You effectively watch back a recording of the finished individual frames stacked next to each other to give a real time video.
---
they did not lol. we got oce servers at the start of mop and classic oce servers have been confirmed.
---
My first and main character always looks like me in every video game I play. Everything created from then on is a grab bag.
---
He didn't realise the same server for the lvl5 stress test is same for lvl 10 .
---
They came in towards the end of vanilla.
---
Other than world PvP, there won't be a lot of that I wager. On Beta it happens because the action is levelcapped and people take their time trying out everything that's on the menu, but after launch, everyone will be busy leveling.
---
Don't forget, you have to actively leave your leveling-path and haul ass to the BG portals to queue up.
---
So for the most part it will be open world PvP, once people start trickling into the neutral zones. Unless you are planning on using engineering later on, it's not worth it, because that profession will eat up ALOT of money, time and materials, leaving you at disadvantages in leveling speed, training costs and mount-gold.
---
No, wrong data is worse than no data.
---
There will be an addon for that, no worries.
---
That feel when the character you rolled just happens to be the perfect fisherman, too.
---
Well, they have had an internal working Linux version for a very long time. Not sure if they still keep that up to date, though. They never chose to release it.
---
Oh ok, so guild items/gold has to be held by an individual player?
---
How would that even work. Lets say you need 5 days /played on average if you're really fast. You have 7 days to get it done, and you need to probably gear a tank or two for it aswell.
---
Even getting to 60 in the first week will be extremely hard unless you stop sleeping. Doing that and getting 30+ people attuned to MC and at least some of them reasonably geared seems crazy.
---
you will get ganked all the time leveling.
---
gankers never did it for the honor. same for people who want quest mobs.
---
People will probably be doing pvp. Maybe not in BGs, but in contested questing zones.
---
Get a fuck ton once people start making twinks too
---
Most will quit at about level 14 and roll hunter.
---
Something like this is cheap (500ish USD mark) but should still be able to run classic on high settings.

---
Personally I'd then get an external monitor that's 24" or more and a keyboard and mouse but you could probably just use the laptop with a shitty old mouse if you're really tight.
---
Nightbane I assume you mean?
---
Well, is winning the sole reason of doing the BG? Or are the 3639 HK gathered along the way worth a reason as well?
---
AH purchases was instant, sending to your self or your own other characters were instant, sending to guildies was instant.
---
Sending to anyone else took 1 hour, and you coud only send 1 item per mail. The difference in beta now is that every mail is instant and you can put a lot of items in one mail.
---
Rolling a mage aren't you.
---
Hello!
---
I’m actually not that great at using the actually keys on the keyboard yet. I played flute for over a decade so my fingers tend to fly a bit so I’m working on it. 
---
He showed me the key bind thing!! My fingers are pretty short so I’m focusing on reaching those. 😭
---
I mean what is life
---
it's fine. and if you do want to raid you can find an offtank spot (or 3rd tank etc).
---
can’t ruin something u don’t have. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
probably not much since honor won't be in game
---
portals everywhere, flying in Outland (which is already a small continent), dailies, 5 mans designed for speed running/emblem farming (just like BFA), summoning stones, extreme faction imbalance (no reason to ever play alliance in TBC, under any circumstance), faction based servers.
---
1-60 was turned into a solo game, just like 60-70.
---
you got downvoted by an asmongoloid fanboy sorry
---
good idea though
---
&gt; I'm grateful I've never tried meth because it would destroy my life...adderall almost did.
---
Methamphetamine and amphetamine are almost indistinguishable even to regular users. The former just has an incredible stigma surrounding it because it's easier to manufacture. No drug dealer is going to go through a lengthier process to create regular amphetamine which has half the potency of meth mg for mg.
---
The only real difference is that meth addicts are abusing MUCH higher doses and vaporizing/snorting/injecting it. All of these routes of administration cause an intense rush of euphoria that cannot be achieved by ingesting the substance in the form of a pill. In fact, methamphetamine pills are prescribed for severe ADHD in the US under the brand name Desoxyn. If you google people's experience with it, you'll find that most people find it more effective for ADHD than Adderall/Vyvanse because at effective doses meth has less physical side effects (heart rate, sweating, shaking) than amphetamine.
---
Do whatever you want. Make whatever list you want. You don't need permission from randoms on Reddit.
---
And people have gotten a lot better at playing this game over the years. Experience and practicing for years is a thing.
---
I remember when the Everquest progression servers opened up. Old veterans as well people that never left the game joined in. These people have a ton of experience playing. So they made short work out of everything basically. Raids were a lot more successful. People getting their epic weapon quests done quickly. It's just a reality.
---
There is always demand for tanks. Especially when AQ20 and ZG is available. Very casual guilds are able to take down several bosses (if not clear) and they don’t demand too much commitment. Not sure how well PUGs would do but I’m sure you could find a spot in a casual guild that just throws raids together
---
go back
---
Yeah but wouldn’t it be easier to just lock your exp? /s
---
the important thing to remember is that everyone has been playing enhancement wrong in raids for years, confirmed by the HD themselves during the shaman discussion. 
---
The reason for their shitty dps came down to trying to force a PvP Burst build to work in an environment that cares more about sustained, long-term dps.
---
Raiding enhancement is supposed to be built around super fast 1hder or fast (sub 3.0 speed) 2hders.
---
they play pretty much exactly like a Spelladin does.
---
Molten core can essentially be 20-manned with competent and well-geared (prebis/t1) players.
---
I will use engineering later on, when the honor system gets implemented, but like you say, focusing on leveling might be better
---
wow that would be freaking epic lol
---
can someone do tell him lol? that would be so epic
---
containment realms
---
&gt; TIL side by side video comparisons aren't evidence.
---
[here's how to hyperlink](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile/comments/8d1v2r/how_to_hyperlink/)
---
&gt; What matters is how it was at 1.12
---
actually you don't decide what matters for others. yes, the cheesed out version and if you pushed the easy way it's hypocritical to tease the "vanilla was hard" or "vanilla is about the journey" when you trivialize the journey :)
---
&gt; They also have WW axe and probably the best gear they can possibly have in every slot, it's not the same as leveling through that content normally.
---
OH THE FAMOUS WW axe which does ... nothing for mitigation?! maybe instead of learning about video evidence that you don't provide you should learn about tanking and mitigation.
---
&gt; Higher level content that you aren't absolutely max geared for... obviously...
---
of the next expansion maybe? or for patchwerk only? we will never know.
---
&gt; They are providing the final version of Vanilla. 
---
they are providing the nerfed version.
---
&gt; No matter what they did, there would be people like you who would bitch and moan about one thing being in X patch and not Y
---
no matter what they did, there will always be brain dead fanboys that will defend bulshit. or maybe it's astroturfing. 
---
&gt;  If you don't like WoW as it was in 1.12, don't play.
---
if you don't like what i write, don't read.
---
&gt; Don't forget that people know way more about the game now as well, which is part of the 'It's easier than I remember' argument.
---
mitigation is still mitigation. where did they learned from? private servers? but they have the wrong data! 
---
btw the guy tanking in the clip has been tanking from DM up to SM with a 2h. you can find the vods in the link provided. so he did it even before having "THE BEST GEAR IN THE GAME!!!!!!111one"
---
What? I dual box my 1 account all the time... haven’t figured out how to play both characters at the same time though.
---
Why couldn’t they make the movie as good as these cinematics is my question.
---
oops. 
---
We are an alliance household, but my bf said horde is the better class for classic. 
---
I still want to get both banners though, I like playing as an undead. I’ll be a troll mage for classic (he’s a shaman) so we can start in the same area.
---
To be honest its possible to play 1.12 AV without rushing, but people have adapted a playstyle about only pvping to get as much honor per hour as possible.
---
Rather than pvping to have fun.
---
I used a well known name as an example in a use case. How does that constitute "getting triggered", please explain.
---
You can use the same technique to, for example, use for development jobs in the bay area, but remove results in San Francisco:
---
```
---
jobs "software developer" "bay area" -"San Fancisco"
---
Wow sick skip!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
a blizz "classic" TBC server would be based on 2.4.3, just like classic is  based on 1.12.1, which means everything applies, besides they would probably bring back attunements.
---
Hello, 
---
I'm looking for a guild in *Alliance - EU (german, english)*, specifically one who is willing to play with unorthodox specs. My plan is to *raid* as a *Ret-Paladin*. I'm fully aware that Ret-Paladin is a pretty terrible dps-spec and that I will most likely end up at the bottom of the DPS meters, but  it's what I want to do as paladin is the class I love most and ret is the spec I always liked best.
---
A bit about me, I've been playing WoW since shortly after vanilla release and rolled a paladin. Raiding was my passion, I only dabbled a bit in PVP and quit it altogether, when talents were changed so that the 15/5/31 spec was suboptimal for raiding and a full holy spec provided significant boosts. I played holy thorughout almost the entirety of vanilla (my guild was 12/15 in Naxx), my only ret raiding experience in vanilla is with the 2.0 patch (where ret was extremely overpowered). I extended to holy and prot in the first half of TBC and ret &amp; prot in the second half. I played those two specs until I quit WoW in May 2011 after Cataclysm patch 4.1.
---
I'm a competitive player, who likes to go the extra mile (though time is much shorter than it was 10-15 years ago) and I'll try my best to not slack too much as a ret paladin in the raid. If you are interested, please send me a DM, I use discord, but I prefer to send those contact data privately.
---
Almost everyone I know is going to play classic just in hopes of going straight to TBC eventually.  
---
I am not sure why so many people forget just how frickin loved and popular that expansion was.  Good luck fighting that fanbase; not to mention the cheapest thing they could do is just port that content over, and no need to pick some patch in the middle either. 
---
The game doesn't last forever no matter what they do.  It was built around the knowledge that they would indeed be "expanding" the game via level cap somehow.
---
Picture perfect progression, most beautiful raids, best story, arena,  balanced classes without losing their identity, beautiful zones ,etc. But dogshit expansion? Man please...
---
You are completely right. One more thing you've forgotten is that TBC was the first expansion to make the old world completely irrelevant outside of leveling your character and professions. Once you're 58 the WHOLE of Azeroth becomes irrelevant and useless, and you're stuck on that tiny space-y new world, Outland.
---
/dance
---
Male it is then.
---
holy freaking shit
---
that mob just broke his hearthstone cast omfg can we get youtube on this?
---
Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference with a 15% error. His calculation and the works he produced because of it is still why he's called the "father of geography".
---
Yea, I'd be open to that as long as you got relaxed expectations on availability. I was also planning on PST NA/West PVE (Alliance) server. I like to pvp but BGs only.

If only I was decided what I'm going to main FeelsBadMan
---
based
---
&gt; well-geared (prebis/t1)
---
Takes longer than 6-10 hours after dinging 60, no?
---
You can heal as shadow for dungeons/easier raid content just as you'll see non-protection warriors also tank that same content. For the harder content like second half of AQ40/Naxx it will be expected that you'd go a healing spec. Each raid has the option of having at least 1 full time Shadow Priest as they provide a debuff that increases shadow damage for other members but beyond that you'd be healing.
---
I like your idea!! 
---
I’m playing on his account rn so i can play with his other characters too. 
---
Yea he said it might be hard for me at first to play classic, but he wants me to explore the childhood experience he had.
---
Yes
---
Yeah but to me it just seems off that a half-cow turns into a bear, or cat. Or how a werewolf turns into a cat.
---
I never played classic, the realisation that classic really is easy has really put a dampener on it for me. I feel I’ll play to scratch that itch, do some raiding then quit. 
---
It’s entirely possible that classic could be dead after 12 months
---
It's pretty nice when you can Rend+Hamstring kite but you still run into mobs that are immune to Rend and that is painful.
---
no freaking idea
---
this guy is just too smart for us... maybe we will figure it out by release... ugh
---
As a huge fan of both, this is 1000% accurate
---
Me and a buddy actually solved the ret paladin dps issue back in vanilla. There’s an axe you can get from one of the ZG bosses that lets you hit again for more damage as a proc on hit. This stacks with the pally blessing that will also proc on hit. They’ll both proc each other. One auto attack can turn into 20 swings, and we would basically one shot tanks in the BGs for fun. 
---
Im sure this would work with any proc on hit weapon but I recall the ZG one just lining up well with where we were at progression wise. Idk if blizz fixed this in the beta. I won’t be playing anyway though due to lack of time ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I already said the raid progression is good, everything else is dogshit, including the 5 mans designed for speed-running.
---
Its like saying the raids in WoD were good, which is true. But does that make it a good expansion?
---
I was laughing about this with a friend recently. I only got one though, but enchanted it and everything. Didn't know there were people even more badass than my teenage self.
---
Everything I know about WOW is from reddit and him. :) 
---
I like how I can see other people in the game. All my other games are single player so I don’t get much interaction with others.
---
It doesn't matter at the end of the day.  Simply moving over to TBC is the cheapest move they could make.  They are doing layering/sharding because it saves them money on servers and server maintenance.  They have a form of loot trading and automated punishment via right click reporting, because it cuts down on GMs.
---
From a corporate stand point, if classic becomes a titan of a game like vanilla did, then it would only make sense to copy what happened back then and release the most popular iteration of the game which was TBC.  
---
The growth only stopped when wrath hit; it would make much more sense for this discussion to happen post TBC because of that fact.
---
i feel like a spriest or rogue would be best 1v1.
---
No chance, sorry.
---
enhancement shaman in pve is about as shitty as ret paladin
---
only people that will get to do it are people in circlejerks
---
Human in wow means humanoids not homo sapiens. Humans ingame are ancestors of Rock people.
---
Lucky for you, I've included, let me count them...ten class picking guides!
---
I didn’t know what a vending machine was until I showed him these comments. Lol. 
---
I’ll be an awesome vending machine tho. All the options available for everyone :)
---
WASD is objectively not as good as moving it over to ESDF on a regular keyboard. You're arguing about things you have no idea about.
---
Yeah, I think people in this thread calling for buffs are missing the point. You can't put the genie back in the bottle. There's nothing thats going to make the magic come back like when you first boot up Morrowind, Dark Souls, Zelda, etc.
---
2pm PDT- 4pm PDT.
---
For me, it's non cursed orcs.
---
A lot of streamers have pledged their intention to hide their chosen realm until the last possible moment. Since a lot of us will be making characters 2 weeks before launch, there's really no way to avoid the ones that do this.
---
So i'm a fan boy because i don't agree with. Cool story bro
---
You will drown in a puddle though :o
---
not really. its close to T1...

**&lt;BANISH&gt; [A] EU PVP English**
---
**&gt;&gt; Schedule**
---
Raid Times: Tue/Thu/Sun 19:00-23:00 (CET) + Wed on BWL/AQ/Naxx releaseday.
---
**&gt;&gt; About Us**
---
Banish is one of the oldest and longest running private server raiding guilds – It was founded in 2015 on Nostalrius and is still active on  horde Lightbringer now. Over the last four years we have accumulated an active community of the most dedicated and experiences players the vanilla wow scene has to offer. We pride ourselves for our warm atmosphere where people enjoy logging on for more than just killing bosses. 
---
**&gt;&gt; Experience and Achievements**
---
With over 59 recorded Kel’Thuzad kills we are arguably the most experienced vanilla guild out there. We are:
---
- Clearing MC since September 2015
---
- Clearing BWL since January 2016
---
- Killing world bosses weekly since March 2017
---
- Clearing AQ since June 2017
---
- Clearing Naxx since January 2018
---
**&gt;&gt; Goals/Expectations**
---
On release we expect most people to get raid-ready in a timely manner, but acknowledge the social commitments of our members who are unable to do so. From phase three (BWL) onward we will aim for first week, if not first day clears (we will add a Wednesday raid on content releases). After progression we will reclear weekly and cut down on raidtime where possible.
---
To achieve our goals we expect everyone to:
---
- be dedicated and motivated, during and after progression
---
- have full knowledge of raid mechanics and intricacies before entering
---
- bring full consumables, no matter what
---
- have a mature and respectful attitude
---

Seems fine to me. I kinda have the TierZoo mindset that animals are specialized for something. It makes sense that bears are tougher than big cats, so if you wanna take hits, you're a bear.
---
ya
---
you get downvoted for anything anti streamer or when you talk about mechanics, good thing downvotes don't matter and people cope via removing other peoples internet points
---
Yep! For me it’s the closest color to heroic fantasy drawings (like war hammer paper,  hero quest and other games from my childhood)
---
Hi, /u/cherrypapi
---
&gt;I know there is no answer to this question 
---
That kinda answers your question.
---
There is no "best class". A Warlock murders a lot of people, but put him up against an Enhancer dispelling his protective buffs, and hes mincemeat. A Hunter will destroy almost every warrior, but let him meet a shadow and hes dead. Rogues can absolutely murder someone, and then get dotted and laughed at with their cooldowns and pants down. A Druid is far less dangerous than an MS warri, but good luck trying to catch him when hes the WSG flag carrier, or simply decides to avoid you.
---
There is no best class, and there is no ranking of classes either. This is Classic, where PvP was Rock-Paper-Scissors, not Retail where it became a balanced out sludge of indifference.
---
Hunter or rogue would be my vote. Hunters are so much fun especially in world pvp with engineering. Kite and take on multiple people with basic gear.
---
Because 99.999% of regular consumer PCs wouldn't be capable of running it? I mean, no game comes even close to being so detailed as of 2019, let alone an MMO with a huge open world and possibly hundreds of players in one spot. The cinematic was probably rendered by a bunch of basically supercomputers over a long period of time.
---
Casual guilds aren't going to raid AQ40.  Whatever you thought was casual definitely sounds like it fell more in line with semi serious, and you simply got carried by other people, as was the norm back then.  
---
With that said, yea, if you don't mind not being that much of an asset to your raid team, then you probably can get away with doing this on a hybrid class/healer.. just not as a DPS class/spec where it is extremely obvious that you are not doing you job well enough.
---
Wow I didn’t even know that post existed. What a masterpiece. Thanks to all that contributed.
---
Ok....and what?
---
Ahh yes Halo, WoW, and Limewire the holy trinity
---
you guys are pretty cringe for blatantly taking database stuff from classicdb and then making tons of money off it
---
Ok, but 2-3 hybrid builds being 'accommodated' means that they are leeching off the generosity/ignorance of people who aren't doing the same thing.
---
Yes... you can get away with it.  It is just a dick move.  Not sure why people are pretending like it isn't.
---
&gt; I’d be interested in how many people did MC, clearers MC, did BWL, cleared BWL, did AQ40, cleared twin emps, cleared c’thun, stepped into naxx, killed some bosses, cleared it.
---
Me, mostly. Never killed C'thun and didn't fully clear Naxx but did everything else as well as reach pvp rank 11 (Commander) on my warrior.
---
ENTP "the debater", played druid retail vanilla and on pservs. Miight go lock for classic.
---
not sure... hm... how could it work.... 25 + 5.... hm....
---
a better question would be to ask about warrior prot talent affecting it
---
Damn it they would release it right when school starts -_-  bummer.
---
the state of this sub

yikes, op please ignore this
---
The best class in PVP is the one you can actually play and have fun with. Spriest, Rogue, Mage and Warlocks are all strong classes on their own in 1v1, but I just can't handle them. Give me my Hunter and I am good to go, even though they are not the strongest. Even more so, when you reach high-end equipment.
---
I can't say often enough how glad I am that we do not have that problem in the EU :-)
---
Those cinematic take months to make, the rendering alone is weeks. It's about $10,000 and 40-50 man-hours PER SECOND.
---
That's $1.5 million and 6000 hours for your average cinematic.
---
feral is worthless unless your guild funnels you gear in bwl and on, don't be delusional
---
Ok, but that spec clearly means you are not performing as well as expected.  
---
If you pull this off secretly, then yea, you likely will get away with it.  Just means you are a dick.
---
So, being mostly correct is MUCH better than not having any data at all.
---
lol nice i can relate lol
---
those darn items never dropped lol am i right bros
---
I have been playing males since Vanilla, and I'll be damned if my Warlock is anything other than a gloriuos, chest haired, bearded, muscle-bound bastard!
---
HOLY FREAKING SHIT LOIS CHECK THIS OUT THIS IS AWESOME
---
THANK YOU DUDE I WILL USE THIS ON DISCORD
---
Gone in the patch 1.10, so no worries.
---
I guess logically I just view orcs, humans, trolls, elves, etc. as "humanoid" whereas tauren, worgen, pandaren, etc. are more manimal than humanoid. 
---
Just like in Skyrim when khajiit or Argonian turn into werewolves, it just seems so strange. You're already part-animal and now you're turning into a different one.
---
There is no guild bank in classic, what are you even talking about?
---
WASD is used because Quake set the standard which became tradition, and traditions are hard to break.  ESDF gives you access to more keys.
---
And the OP specifically mentioned:
---
&gt;helping me out with using the keyboard cause I’m not used to it yet. I’ve been a Nintendo / PS4 gamer for the most part.
---
By which I'm guessing she's used to the "gimmick" of using your thumb for movement + secondary functions rather than just spacebar.  I'll also wager she has used a keyboard for typing before, and is accustomed to keeping her fingers on and hitting the keys around the home row.
---
Oh wait! I've never thought of that :o I'm from EU ! So it still runs us and eu!? Well I feel dumb now..
---
Oh I spent every penny on those bad boys
---
there are no racials or classes that affect fishing
---
Read some history, always been like that
---
I was like 13 when I played classic now I start medical school first week of september. Was really hoping for a “classic summer”.  Oh well. Bummer.  :/.
---
It all sorta comes down to situations, skill and gear. Shadow priests, rogues, shamans and paladins are considered to be better duelers while a warrior backed by any healer will stomp in group PvP. So yeah, hard to say really.
---
And for warriors?  
---
Do you think most guilds now days are going to accept seeing half their DPS warriors slapping on an MS debuff for the sake of their mix?  Everyone is painfully aware of the debuff limit.  And there is actually a very strong hybrid build that lets you get MS and still have most of the fury tree you'd want... but it just would be a dick move in any semi serious guild.
---
Well I sorta asked out to make it as a whole.. I honestly I have no idea where they play
---
Designed for speedrunning? I hardly doubt you were able to speedrun any HC before at least havin pretty much full T5. Yeah a few design decisions were flawed allowing to skip a chunk here and there but 5 mans from a tuning aspect were absolutely brutal in TBC. God cleanse me from shattered halls memories
---
What a complete dogshit post, trash take.
---
How bout no, Scott?

**&gt;Schedule&lt;**
---
**&gt;About Us&lt;**
---
Banish is one of the oldest and longest running vanilla raiding guilds – It was founded in 2015 on Nost and is still active on horde LB now. Over the last four years we have accumulated an active community of the most dedicated and experiences players the vanilla wow scene has to offer. We pride ourselves for our warm atmosphere where people enjoy logging on for more than just killing bosses. 
---
**&gt;Experience and Achievements&lt;**
---
**&gt;Goals/Expectations&lt;**
---
**&gt; Are you interested?&lt;**
---
I can't play a character unless he at least vaguely looks and "thinks" like me, or in other words, the character is at the very least a dude.
---
No it's not. You cannot be "mostly correct". You are either correct or not correct.
---
Dozens!
---
Might need to add a couple priests and a shaman or two for Naxx and one of the other tanks going full Prot, but that is the optimal comp for 95% of the game. If you are having too much trouble gearing the Warriors replace on or two with a rogue and maybe even a Feral Druid.
---
Personally I don't know much about retail Vanilla, I hit 60 and 2 weeks later TBC came out, but I do remember the TCG in game items being announced, so I think it happened during,my time in TBC.
---
I'll be playing Female Orc Rogue, mostly because the Male orcs look awful.
---
But for Undead, Troll, and Tauren, the Male models look better. Same for Human, Night Elf, and Dwarf. Gnome is a toss-up, they're basically identical.
---
Rough but true. Horde's entire value is in windfury and clumping for chain heal.
---
**&lt;Nightshift&gt;** | Server: NA-PvP | Faction: Horde | Off Peak Hours
---
**Intro:** &lt;Nightshift&gt; is a guild for any Classic WoW players who want to play and raid during off peak hours on a US realm.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Regarding raid days and times, there is a survey in progress but the plan is to have 2 scheduled raids a week. At the moment the days most people can make are late Wed night/Thu morning, late Thu night/Fri morning and late Fri night/Sat morning. And so far 1-4AM/2-5AM/3-6AM EST raid times seems to be most popular.
---
But it's still early days, so these are not set in stone! Also as the guild grows and the game progresses there's always the possibility of additional raid days and/or raid groups.
---
20/40man Raid loot will be distributed by a loot council - made up of officers, plus 1 random raid member for transparency.
---
**Looking for:** Anyone with an unusual schedule or in a different time zone who has a passion for Classic and a good attitude. We are mostly in need of dps and heals, especially Shamans, but all applications will be considered. If you're interested in an officer position, please be sure to provide more information on your application. Purely social members are always welcome.
---
**Moving forward:** As for the form the guild will take in the future, it depends on various factors but it will be somewhere between a semi-casual and semi-hardcore type raiding guild. We may strive for greatness but our primary goal will always be having fun!
---
**Apply:** If this sounds interesting please check out the link below:

---
Thanks guys
---
I only play PvP servers. I basically like PvP 90% of the time.
---
I still remember doing all the totem quests right away when I got them, good times.
---
mmh, heroics.. want...
---
Can you pass on my thanks to the wowhead team for years of fantastic service and to the person who added the comments from allakhazam and thottbot to the classic section.
---
It doesn't really add much in the way of content, but it's nice to see history restored. And reading the old comments is really cool and nostalgic. It's surprising how more positive and polite people were then.
---
there's only tryhard fanboys here. Don't you dare talk shit about their game
---
My old guild on K2 (Wipe Club, horde) speedran MC in [less than half an hour] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12hINrRUTo8). From the first Molten Giants to rag. This was recorded less than a month after BWL was released. You can see my hunters nameplate at the side, too (Stregen). Gear ranged from spotty prebis/t1 to some T2 pieces, and obviously BWL weapons that made a big difference.
---
Thats why they are asking. Perhaps they didn't know
---
I see your point but there's a reason why many players "remembered" the game being more difficult. Similarly, there's a reason why many players on the K1 pserver complained about the content being "undertuned" when there was no proof of that being the case. 
---
A lot of people describe it as that everyone was bad/trash back then. Either way, the average player is much better in 2019 than in Vanilla, and it doesn't boil down to fight mechanics - that's an oversimplification. Thus, my statement stands that the average player experience in terms of difficulty will be altered.
---
You want other to make the list for you is what you asking?
---
Again, Eratosthenes was 85% correct and transformed the entire field of geography, exploration, and astronomy, for the better. So no, being correct is not binary.
---
So much nostalgia
---
There are no BGs at all at classic launch, even the portals wont be there yet.
---
And would you tell me where you looked up your information to create a list like this?
---
Classicdb has blatantly taken numerous things from Wowhead - 99% of the comments are taken verbatim, except for editing out links users included to other Wowhead pages, as well as articles staffers such as myself were paid to write like the Classic overview and faction articles. http://classicdb.ch/?guide=cwcat vs https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-classes-and-talent-overview
---
Those images you see on every NPC page and tooltip are taken from Wowhead's image hosting server, generated by Wowhead's model viewer. Example: http://classicdb.ch/?npc=13161 https://wow.zamimg.com/modelviewer/thumbs/npc/6852.png
---
The tooltip page uses functions based on Wowhead's system, you can even see Wowhead mentioned in the code - http://classicdb.ch/?tooltips
---
As for things like filters and the concept of a database, Wowhead's database is nearly 15 years old. Wowhead's layout has changed a bit over the years, and Classicdb's current design is basically Wowhead's old layout down to the similar fonts and menus.
---
PVP where if you’re a healer, threat is automatically decided for you.
---
Nightfall duty isn’t a thing in TBC.
---
It's more the fact that if it can be done by addon the the functionality is in fact already there. I'd rather Bliz focus any hypothetically limited time they have on a feature that can't be handled by an addon.
---
Well no, he was 100% incorrect on that specific instance. It is literally binary.
---
Downloading some music video and getting porn instead xD
---
In this case he said something reasonable but wrong and you were still a dick.
---
TBC started the downfall of WoWs design. Arena and Resilience gear killed off BGs, flying mounts killed off world interaction.
---
Best raids? Don't make me laugh. The fact that they downsized from 40man alone made them crap. Factor into that the idiotic mixture of wellfare-epics (Kharazan, Mag, Gruul, most of BT, Rep/Sunisland) and bosses so stupidly overtuned that they killed entire servers worth of guilds (Brutallus, M'uru) bugged as crap (Vash) or straight out exploitable (A'lar), and you got yourself an expansion that left a lot of people disenchanted with raiding, even after being successful at it, leading straight to blizzard doing a 180 and giving us WotYawnRaids.
---
&gt;don't die
---
&gt;don't risk wiping the raid
---
&gt;attack a lot
---
&gt;don't cap energy
---
&gt;use rupture
---
&gt;use your cooldowns
---
&gt;2/3 ruthlessness in your dagger pvp spec

---
&gt;gnome is the best for rogue pvp on alliance
---
who upvotes this stuff? seriously?
---
Enhance shamans terrible? What? Ya'll got some shit memory. Any decent enhance shaman will be a huge asset for their team.
---
A male orc is still more relatable as a guy than a female orc.
---
a) low end gear Ima say hunter. They can just pop bestial wrath and their pet will flat out rape any caster. Plate wearers you can kite if you save hard CC for pally freedom and just drain his mana. 
---
b) mid gear I’ll say mage, rogue, and still hunter. This is where mages and rogues start to get enough stats to play their style of game
---
c) Shadow Priest, Warlock, Druid, Mage, Warrior, Ele Sham, rogue. So here are most classes except for hunter because by now they’ve been outscaled. The casters have enough stamina to survive the melee and cheese  combos. Warriors are still pretty shit without a healer but they can straight up dick somebody with MS. Im adding Druid here because they have enough mana to play their game which is dot and fight in form then kite away really fast to heal. Low end druids can’t do it as much because shifting rails your mana pool early on.
---
d) the pinnacle of PvP of PvP is a BiS warrior with either a paladin or priest healer.
---
You're an idiot.
---
If you hate my example, a good one is how Threat is calculated in Vanilla. It's a range. The numbers were constantly being updated with better data, but were never 100% accurate until Blizzard added threat to the combat log. But the chance of your offset being wrong and pulling aggro is much smaller than your chance of pulling aggro if you have no idea of your threat at all.
---
Knowledge of incorrect data is better than no data at all.
---
Thanks! Erorus worked on a lot of the comment importing, and the Wayback Machine was also very helpful in facilitating work, I encourage people to donate to that project!
---
You're right, that kinda slipped my mind. Thanks for pointing it out.
---
It's actually one of the best spec in Vanilla for PvP but yeah keep talking shit.
---
&gt; So it still runs us and eu!? 
---
Why wouldn't it? :D
---
It didn’t confirm anything, it was a measured, reasonable reply. Yet you received it like, what do they call them, a sperg
---
This was how it worked all the way till Wrath.  It actually had to be changed because of the  Mastercraft Kalu'ak fishing pole.  So, not only does it remove glancing but it also gives a static amount of hit/crit/expertise(kind of) per level back then which resulted in never being missed, dodged, parried, and having 9% crit with no glancing.  While it wasn't viable on every class, it actually worked on ret paladins who only had to give up two major abilities to use it.  But because the itemization was completely different (ie no crit cap, no hit rating/expertise on gear) it was very much viable while it was in the game.
---
Yeah I've been playing vanilla on private servers for like 6 years straight and I don't feel burned out at all, rather be in the beta
---
So please tell me, how much time do a random lvl60 spend in a lvl20 zone ?
---
This "retarded way" was already present in classic, and unless you have an amazing idea it is still the best solution at hand. Flawed yes but still the best
---
Can’t say I agree with you I’m afraid. I for one am loving all the nostalgic posts and pictures from Vanilla, of which there seems to be loads.
---
Nice collection, wish there was one for priest
---
this is also my opinion. Any shitty currency farm that locks you to a character is anti-alt regardless of how trivial they make it 8 months into the xpac. the artifact idea is a cancer that should be removed. vanilla, while slow to level, is extremely alt friendly in that for a large portion of it, very strong gear comes from dungeons (not m+ or heroic, just regular old dungeons) and the only currency farm is gold for a mount. Will you have fast riding on your alt? fuck no. Will it matter? negatory
---
I miss Kinetic from Classic and BC.  It's ya boy Sanka BTW. Miss all y'all.
---
LOL sure bud
---
&gt; But he was also pro-tanking everything...so it was a smooth run regardless.
---
To the degree you can be when there is so much random miss, parry, dodge and resist.
---
in particular i am interrested in spell coefs if they are identical, above or below the old theorycraft numbers.
---
Here's a clip from the spelldata.lua file within, look at percentage and test without talents is the only way to do so... sadly spell coef for low rank spells are lower than max and theorycraft depends on the highest rank :/
---
still i would like to know what a low rank has as coef just as refference.

I heard Asmon advocate for these to be in game yesterday by saying something along the lines of "levelling to max in 5 months is not a rush". 
---
If they make them phase exclusive and they last 5 months, most people that would want them could comfortably make it to 60 within that timeframe.
---
I really want the Ivory Raptor since I'm going to be a Troll but them being in the game or not won't affect my levelling speed whatsoever. More like something cool to look forwards to when I ding.
---
I remember my computer looking like this, I also remember accidentally alt-tabbing and having to take a 5 minute break because of it.
---
"Item Level" is roughly how strong an item is in terms of stats. If the item has a level requirement (in classic/vanilla), it's usually 10 less than the ilv.
---
So that item is roughly the equivalent of a "requires Level 23" BoE, but only requires lv 20 (if you get carried, dude's lv 32 elite).
---
The moment those streamers on the beta entered the dungeons and were like "this shit so ez, must be wrong" i was shaking my head. I wouldn't have done anything about it but i kept seeing some apes arguing that elites should hit way harder (like 2x harder or more). I just wanted to shut their dam mouth, thas all.
---
Well, to be fair, my anticipation for Pantheon is still up there. I'd love to play both and see the pace and content differences. :)
---
Well, I guess that's enough time to gather the quest mats 3x over :(
---
I'm excited to see people do Hobbs-style pulling of entire dungeons on a prot pally to power level alts in no time at all
---
Cope.
---
Sorry, not at this time.  I was kind of hoping someone else would take it upon themselves to tackle that particular task.  Maybe I can find the time before Classic drops...
---
No, humanoid and human are two different things
---
They’re all humanoid
---
There’s one human
---

yeah thats cringe
---
Well, most of them are of his face....

Me suggesting that your sense of humour not aligning with his or people that enjoy his stream, which is perfectly fine, led you to believe it is a ‘secret club thing’? I’m keen you know your train of thought there

---
&gt; I dont not like the guy but
---
Why would a female character not “think” like you?
---
Do you relate more to a running cow than a human female?
---
The actual way of playing enhance is to never plan on the proc happening. You play as if you only had you auto-attacks, shocks and totems. 
---
95% of shamans I have seen in vanilla couldn't play that properly.
---
he did ask someone
---
[First big Hammerfall world PVP raid as well](https://imgur.com/yzK3eii)
---
Arenas gave the skillceiling of wow PvP, no need to ever think of BGs from that point on. Competitive skill &gt; a pug BG.
---
In my post I referenced the "average" player and referred to the "average" player experience. Hardcore players will always find content easy by comparison. Retail tried to accommodate these players which lead to systems like hardmodes, mythic raiding, and mythic + dungeons. I'm obviously not suggesting that. 
---
All I'm saying is that some tuning actually goes a long way to preserve the Vanilla experience for the average player. While the pserver playerbase doesn't represent the classic playerbase perfectly, pservers that tuned content to be difficult (i.e., Nost) were more popular and well received that pservers that did not (i.e., K1). 
---
How much should everything be tuned exactly? That's obviously a tough question but it's clear that the current state of the game will lead to a significantly altered experience for the average player (in terms of difficulty), whileas a pserver like Nost was able to preserve that to some extent via tuning.
---
Is there any advantages to using this over just making a weakaura?
---
I’m honestly baffled reading this, as a guy
---
Let's hope they make an "heroic classic" server where everything's harder then
---
Retail is not fun. Classic Beta is the most fun I've had in a while. How smug of me for thinking so.
---
No xD I just completely forgot that that is a thing xD I feel so stupid... But you're absolutely right! Then it's not my problem what so ever :) I've now become a politician! Abandoning my own idea as fast as I got it.
---
Lol no one would be bitching if it came out in like june or july. A lot of us that played vanilla back in the day are now in graduate school or going for doctrates and summer is the biggest block of free time a lot of us have to set aside for something like WoW.
---
I read all the patch notes, including undocumented changes, discarded any nerfs or buffs because we're playing a final 1.12 version, read every quest that gets added, read what becomes BIS for every class, including enchants. Did the same for PVP as it gets released.
---
Then I used backups of my Interface folder (thank god they were automatic) to yank all my old Auctioneer data. Unfortunately I don't have pre-BWL data because I wasn't using the addon then, but I have a decent picture of what increased in price.
---
The list is about 900 items long, ranked by biggest swing in price changes that could be attributed to content releases and more guilds reaching certain levels of progression.
---
I played Vanilla, was rank 14 on all 9 classes and was world first every raid like everybody in this sub.

yes you are the best you objectively own all content related to world of warcraft despite thottbot existing before your """brand"""

all of your """content""" was unavailable for normal users for years trying to find content until you announced the new part of the site for classic
---
you are actually arguing that you own original comments posted by users and they are "stolen"
---
the only thing wowhead is good for is the dressing room, everything else is done better somewhere else with 100x less trackers and ads
---
Yep, if you take rose-tinted glasses off and really analyze the things TBC did to the overall game, it's clear that it was a start of what eventually lead to what we have now with BfA. The only things I really love about TBC was Arenas, talents rebalance aaaaand that's basically it. The Outland was shit zone-wise in comparison to Azeroth, the fantasy setting was killed for something space-looking, and it was like 1/10 of Azeroth in size while making the old world completely irrelevant.
---
Yes that set it pre-bis for all melee dps classes, because it gives you stamina, attack power, and most importantly 2% hit and crit rating.
---
The hit rating is very important to be able to not miss or get glancing blows against level 63 elite raid mobs.
---
If you can't hit them or crit them, then you wont generate enough rage, and will be essentially useless.
---
:D You got my vote!

When ESO came out I was in that forever limbo of looking for a mmorpg and never being satisfied with the ones that came out. What was ESO like?
---
I'm playing Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition and absolutely loving it. Nothing to tide me over for WOW Classic like an incredibly deep RPG.
---
Considering his brother gave him the shaman it is likely it was on an other account as well...
---
Im not Sherlock, but I feel there is something fishy with that comment above us mate.
---
I am not calling it sexist just because I want everything to be sexist. Most ads I see I don’t think are sexist, but this one I do. I think that showing a woman dressed in a cheerleading outfit accompanied by the text “Use your touch to grab the hottie” is objectifying, and it is implying that it’s okay to grope women. Those are my reasons why I think the ad is sexist. If you disagree with those reasons, then that is fine, and that is your opinion. Just please don’t try to discredit me by implying I’m just making up reasons for why it’s sexist.
---
Also, to address your second point, I think that is a very subjective opinion. I find the ad sexist, and I do not think sexism is funny, and so I state that opinion.  I assume you either don’t find the ad sexist, or you think sexism is funny, and so you don’t care, you’re having a good time with it. I have better time when ads aren’t offensive to some people, you’re not as sensitive to it. Saying “we all had a better time” when things like this weren’t commented on is just a very broad generalization to a very subjective matter, in my opinion.
---
It's not even just the computational tech that's the problem - cinematography and choreography are drastically different between static and interactive media. Just because a scene is good to watch, that doesn't mean that it would be good to play. The graphics of games are designed for function/gameplay first, and aesthetics/viewing second. Compromises must be made.
---
Yeah and to take aggro from you to let you finish this fishing
---
My pleasure! And purely out of curiosity, what brought you to this post? It's a bit odd that I've gotten two replies in 6 hours of each other to a 5 month old post. Is this high on google or something?
---
I'm betting on &lt;APES&gt; to pull it off.

Isnt WF bugged? He was talking about that all the time first day of WSG at least.
---
mage, rogue are both good choices.
---
frost mage is not very gear dependent (and is quite frankly stronger than elemental mage). and rogue gets to pick every fight, though some pug MC for perdition blade would put it over the top.

ITT:  People who dont realise that people with ADHD have no trouble playing WoW for 15 hours straight without losing concentration

The adderall isnt to keep you awake and focused.  It's to let you get away from the game.
---
This isn't an opinion. This is what blizz stated when THEY designed the classes. Humans are called humans because they are humanoid. That is literally why they are called humans. That doesn't negate that other classes are humanoids as well. Humans in wow are not homo sapiens.
---
If I tell you "your speed is somewhere between 66 and 100 miles per hour and the speed limit is 60 miles per hour", I'm not very accurate, but that's still better than not having any idea of your speed at all. 
---
This is how statistics work. Do you honestly think polling data is ever 100% accurate? It's a sample size, of course not. But having SOME idea is way better than no idea at all.

If you can't see that, you're a moron.

Shortcut to My Computer... This just screams nostalgia.

I think if I got the beta I wouldn't play it.  I would rather save for the release

&gt;makes most people sick to there stomach
---
Do you have any proof for that claim?
---
I love this.
---
What did he say? He deleted the message.
---
Some didn't (as much) and people complained quite a bit. If you go on the wowservers sub you can find a lot of old threads about K1 being undertuned and health regen being too high. 
---
Servers like Nost were tuned to be more difficult which helped preserve the Vanilla experience and contributed to the popularity and success of the server.
---
Is there a way to also remove him from "Selected for you"?
---
hey he kept them on him, dealing with RNGesus is part of pro-tanking (and I think that was back when he still hadn't found a good tank weapon yet).
---
Now is the time to clear your backlog of games, work out, get on Tinder and try to live out the rest of your life in 3 months before you throw it all away for a game with a shelf life of maybe 3 years.

Oh I see, so shadow priest will heal fine in groups and raids, only struggling in a handful of demanding places?
---
Durotar is a lvl 10 zone and everyone was dueling outside of Orgrimar, which is in Durotar. As a lvl 10 Orc you're entering Orgrimmar and see all these T2 characters and you are blown away. And at least the old world is still Azeroth, you are in one world with everyone else. Outland is a completely separate world for high level players only.
---
So youre seriously calling me stupid for pointing out that August is indeed part of summer and not autumn?

Thats an oof

Thats nice but can we get some news on the combat text being used atm, we need the old combat next.
---
It’s not Classic, but nothing beats mongoose imo.
---
Because women are raised in a very different manner from men, and thus the relevant parts of the brain develop slightly differently, leading to a different way of thinking. There are also inherent, biological differences in the way men and women think and behave.
---
Also, the "cows" are clearly just humans with horns and shit. They might as well be native americans. The race is irrelevant because all of them are essentially humans, or humanoids.

You just changed this from wrong data vs no data to some data vs no data.

If that's true, then why were the top teams always certain combos, varying with each patch cycle?
---
And even if it were true, I am not looking for "mechanical skill ceiling" in an MMORPG. There are FPS games for that, if that's your cup of tea.
---
A pug BG with everyone running around doing his thing, brawling and fighting for his side is way more enjoyable to me, and offers much better immersion, than the clinical, sterile, completely divorced from the game world crap that is Arena.
---
Bend the knee of you will burn at the stake !
---
I'd really like to play rogue but fuck, just looking at that pre-raid BiS list and having tried farming it on a rogue on an unnofficial server makes me vomit.
---
Melees were topping meters in later tiers, it's the same in vanilla, some specs that were not viable at start became viable in later tiers. 
---
Also you shitting on tbc and wrath which probably has the most fans out of all xpacs and is considered the last "good" xpac seems very biased. Also don't you maybe, i don't know, think that maybe, just MAYBE people have different opinion than you? So stop shitting on others and showing your opinions as facts.
---
That trinket from is still BLATANTLY a cock 'n' balls though.
---
Which is a bad example since the capital &amp; max lvl players are still there in BFA, although the dueling tradition is lost.
---
So how about this "in classic all content is relevant" (not your quote dw) lvl zone full of max lvl caracters ? 
---
BC wasn't the first time old content became almost useless.
---
Player Versus Mobs/Monsters I think? PvE basically.
---
But if the fights are going to be that easy will the gear really be as rewarding then ? Why be exited about a gearpiece that dropps when you can kill all the bosses anyway ? Genuine question no classic flame
---
Pretty accurate. It's more of a grind. But not harder. Even aq40 and nax I think will be easier now that people are more skilled.
---
Yup. Several private servers already have guilds who complete BWL in well under an hour.
---
What's up bro, remember to like and subscribe.
---
I remember Diremaul East had a quite nice farm run where you would be killing Little plants as a mage. Like 5-6 Groups of plants / reset / and do it again :p
---
I remember it being a quite nice raw Gold farm with good Greens/blues on the side. Also you get herbs which can sometimes sell really well.
---
Should be Videos on YouTube - just look for frost mage DME farm
---
Nope I play Horde. It's not the fake/fantasy portion of it, I just choose to play Male. If I played house as a kid, I would not play the wife...  I dunno how else to put it.  If people play female toons, that's cool. Just not for me
---
yup.
---
everything up until BRD is basically a breeze.
---
Jokes on you. I started on a pserver after not getting beta so now i can be twice as burnt out
---
Mage?
---
Well...if anything the mobs seem to hit faster but its probably just cuz of the high fps, i dont see a difference.
---
You are entitled to your opinion, but todays problem is: People are not content with having an opinion, they want everyone else to have their opinion as well. And that leads our society down a path that is far worse than a few randy jokes in advertising.
---
Also, it's funny that you find this ad "objectifying", when at the same time I am 100% sure you never complained about [something like this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2401/3491/products/MOTU_Vintage_HeMan_00507490-d359-43aa-b961-05e4304dcd40_2048x2048.png?v=1554315585), because apparently, it's never objectifying if it's about the male form, amirite? :D
---
No. 
---
If I ask 1000 people "are you going Horde or Alliance?" and 490 say Alliance and 510 say Horde, so I conclude 49% will be Alliance and 51% will be Horde!
---
If it turns out it's 48% Alliance and 52% Horde, by your moronic "all correctness is binary", I was 100% incorrect.
---
But by statistical analysis, I was only 1% incorrect.
---
The data on ClassicDB is mostly correct. It has a few issues, but their standard deviation from what is probably the real numbers is small. This knowledge is much better than Wowhead's complete lack of numbers at all.
---
truth
---
it matters to them. and besides, it wasn't in vanilla. so "you can go fuck yourself" :)
---
Awesome work +1
---
Ah you made me smile in the morning! Thank you
---
Didn't realize this!  Now it makes sense why he had the bottom thumb button bound to shift.
---
You quoted what he said back to me and said "that's cringe". Would you like me to explain why it isn't? Where does aq40 come into all of this?
---
there will be pugs, maybe not in the first few months but eventually. you should eventually find a casual guild though so when you do raid you'll get priority on gear vs plate dps.
---
Cause the example case is asmon which 50% of this sub seem to hate for no reason.
---
I feel you remember it being harder than it is.
---
&gt; both are predominantly occupupied and close by horde/ally
---
^ thats the part I apparently misunderstood.   
---
I still disagree with you. Stonetalon has both ally and horde stations as well as quests. Its also close to both horde and ally territories. Its the incarnation of what a contested zone should be, similar to ashenvale or STV. 
---
   Meanwhile Wetlands has no horde presence at all. The only reason it is marked as contested is for gameplay purposes. So comparing these 2 zones doesnt make sense when we're talking about quest availability.
---
ahhh of course. I'm a dumb dumb. thanks
---
Negative shits all of you. If Vanilla was so fucking easy, and TBC so bad an expansion, go fucking play BFA, Fortnite or whatever...just do not come here and spread your misery. Go away and take anti-depressive pills, thanks.
---
too many warriors
---
too little rogues
---
too little priests
---
too many hunters
---
too little druids
---
How? Isnt that lvl 35?
---
6 ftw
---
Gee. This brings back some memories. Simple times, huh.
---
It would be different if the choice were just orc, male,female,and undead.   BUT you have the choice to me male or female of any of those races, so I play as male. Because I have the choice, I won't be running around as a female lol  The races aren't the problem in fantasy nor are sexes , but I would not dress up as a female and go to the ren fen. even though you could. It's just me lol Imma dude, I play a manly hero
---
They don't need to do patch notes. They just need people to report bugs.
---
What's the bug?
---
From what I heard it seems to be the exact opposite.
---
Rotations and mechanics are harder in retail - these take skill to perform right.
---
Classic takes grinding and gear - these can be achieved by anyone with enough time.
---
Not saying classic will be bad but thats just the truth
---
Lol you think that's why people WPvP?
---
Travel form indoors
---
there are no tools in classic to deal with that, you just keep pressing sunder armor until it hits.  if this is pro tanking then i was pro tanking in 2004 too.
---
Truth, this sums it up good.
---
Dungeon finder with teleporting for sure. It is amazing QoL and gives more alternatives for leveling, especially support specs.
---
Healers use healing power. Spell power is a different stat
---
At level 19 healer twinks are really good, from my experience. As long as you go for the long run (fishing hat/boots, arena grand master etc.) you'll be a force to be reckoned with. I beat almost every other twink in 1v1 with my level 19 dwarf priest back in TBC
---
Don't worry dude, I'm with you.
---
Cause he is entertaining and puts on a good show, simple as that. 
---
Nobody cared about retail so just him pulling a ton of viewers while streaming it proves that.
---
Not everyone cup of tea ofc
---
Idk how anyone can stand watching a streamer who vapes
---
We should investigate this matter. I am not sure my day can continue without some closure at least!
---
People on here put so much stock into the game being difficult. It wasn't on nostalrius, it was just different. You need to care about very different things, and a lot of things work very differently mechanically. But at no point in my pserver adventure did I think "man this is so difficult compared to retail" (or anything else, really)...
---
It does have a bigger sense of adventure, traveling takes more time, accomplishing stuff feels good mostly because it takes time. I don't know where vanilla got it's rep of being so difficult, but it's time to let it go, or there will be a whole lot of disappointed players. It's time consuming more than difficult.
---
Travel form doesn't break from entering indoors automatically, just like mounting. He initiated the travel form from a valid area.
---
&gt; Yep. Vanilla WoW was me running into a druid in bear form and asking how he became a bear. Then logging out and making a druid.
---
&gt; Classic is people min/maxing their cookie-cutter character while using a guide for the fastest leveling. Can't forget the add-ons to change everything about the game too
---
pretty much. you can see this in threads, especially if people ask about Priest races ("dwarf or undead only") or Professions ("if you aren't going Engineering for the DPS boost, you're trolling").
---
it's part of it, wpvp is the baby version of playing bgs without premades
---
when i wpvp i camp people until they log off if they're being annoying, the honor is a nice bonus
---
Completely agree. I'm way too afraid to get burned out if I would play Beta. Summer is around the corner anyway, lots of stuff to do. I can be patient.
---
Yes. Log out of your google-account and clear your browser cache and cookies.
---
So you can mount up in that area? Never knew that
---
Because you get a choice to choose male or female even if you are running around as a giamt big bird lookin toon. Why would I choose female? I am not a female, I am a male no matter what skin you put over the sex.
---
yea preeetttty much this.  it's kind of interesting how many people on this sub in particular post screens from vanilla and also stat that they were 12 at the time.  It really was not as hard as people remember, it's just that kids in middle school are dumb and bad at games.
---
The most difficulty will be the time ivestment to get lvl60.
---
You seem really upset that some guys don't want to play as females while not judging those that do. 
---
What's on your mind?
---
&gt; “No Changes”
---
"#nochanges until it impacts my muddy memories of Vanilla WoW and then #mychanges to make it authentic."
---
Ahh okay thanks. Misunderstood it :)
---
Haha I'm in the same boat except I did play in Vanilla and loved it (of course, we were all "bad", so it was engaging at the time). You can see in my post history that I've been working double time to try to convince people that dungeon/raid tuning will be good for the game. 
---
But man, people are beyond stubborn on this topic.

They don't own the copyright to any content posted to their site, correct.  That copyright is held by the user who posted the content.  What Wowhead does own is a perpetual license to distribute that content through their site.

Other sites that steal comments from Wowhead or Thottbot are infringing on copyright law, plain and simple.

None. I've never considered making an orc skin rug.

if you love a game you cant i know i cant

classicdb is a snapshot of wowhead everyone knows this, doesn't make it bad. classicdb has a clean interface with nothing really getting in the way. its worked for the private servers for years sorry you are late but people wanted this so someone provided it. dont hate whoever made classicdb because its helped many people.
---
I'm glad we are going to get a new update version from WoWhead but classicdb has been very helpful to me
---
FYI, at work we call them "normies". No, that's not a joke =)
---
I always get sad when I see people start a "Post your old screenshots" topic because I've lost all of mine :(
---
I still use winamp.
---
I agree with this guy. To clarify. I do now want us to be able to use transmog on our classic characters. But if I get a cool item on classic, I would like to be able to transmog my modern wow chars to use that item.
---
You’re spot on.  These level 30s on the beta have gear that is several times better than what people will have on the way to 60.  You may group with someone that doesn’t have a head item or just white shoulders/bracers and there is also about a zero percent chance they are using potions and enchants.
---
What made dungeons difficult wasn’t that any single mob would one shot the tank, but doing them quickly and holding agro over mages and warlocks when there were many mobs.  Mostly not knowing what respawns and what patrols will get you killed or if someone doesn’t know what to do at all.
---
Dude its literally like the last quarter of summer only lol. Not really much of a “classic summer”.   Get ready for aClassic fall would probably have been more fitting.
---
There will be a list at some point but the reality of the situation is that you wont interact with the streamer at all and the chances of you actually being affected by them (except for chat messages talking about them maybe) is really low
---
Yeah I remember I wanted to make a female orc but role-play just as a smaller male. Same with a tauren. 
---
But I just can't play a female character if I have a choice. I can play as Lara Croft and Samus because that's who they are, and I enjoy playing as them in their own  stories but I can't make up my own character that's supposed to represent me as something other than me.
---
Show him how to buy bulk hot pockets
---
Show him piss bottles
---
Show him baby poweder for sweaty gooch seat
---
Show him the  forrest gump "get down shut up" move for when people knock on the door
---
A couple reddit straw polls (aka. pointless) and a single study with 30 participants? Sorry, you have to do better than that.
---
yes thats right pservers overtuned and people were wrong. I knew that the moment they entered the first dungeon on beta and i wasn't gonna do anything about it but the apes wouldnt shut their mouth.
---
Hmm, can’t remember if you can see the sky in the flag room or not
---
You need to fill 40 slots. Any decently competent player that can follow orders will be welcommed. Remember you are dealing with a very limited pool of players to begin with. A raidlead that disregards any capable player wont be leading many raids.
---
I'm annoyed neither of you followed through on the 'told you so' side

Dual spec has no place in Classic. 
---
* It's a part of the game that a Warlock, for example, who has a PVP focused spec will roll over another Warlock (or any other class), even if they have better gear through higher end PVE. It's something that allows PVP focused players to somewhat keep up in WPVP even if they don't have top tier raiding gear. 
---
* You choosing to spec deep Holy to be 7%~ more effective in Raids / Dungeons as opposed to dropping some points into Ret for example, to farm better or be more effective while soloing is a meaningful choice that you get to make and live with.
---
* Not being able to respec on a whim gives you an out when people ask you to heal a dungeon and you're shadow/feral/ret. Something a lot of people who are planning to play meme specs will appreciate.
---
* It allows a lot of creativity for the casual players when designing their own spec for their specific playstyle. If you have dual spec, all you have to do is just copy the BiS spec for Raiding and a BiS spec for flag carrying in WSG. Where now you might think about losing out on a bit of damage in your IRL Friend Guild raids, in favour of getting a few talent points that help in PVP, and think about the best way to do that with your tree.
---
As a bald guy with pretty bad body dysphoria I try to make my characters bald to help me feel more comfortable with who I am. 
---
He's cool and bald, maybe I can be too.
---
Those people are kind of turning a blind eye to the successes and failures of private servers. 
---
One of the earlier pservers (K1) was presumably blizzlike and players constantly complained that it was too easy. Then Nost came along with a higher difficulty which contributed to the servers widespread popularity as a better emulation of the vanilla experience. Nost was also popular to the point where it represented a casual community as much as it represented the hardcore community.
---
Who the hell doesn't keep a finely curated spank bank? How are you going to find all the best most fucked up videos you've jerked off to over the years?
---
You are probably right pserver overtunned helped to preserve the Vanilla experience while being totally wrong.
---
Look like we are gonna have a correct version with Classic but it may break our memories.
---
Chain pulling was how you knew if your group was good or shit.  Deaths and wipes came from over confidence more than tanks being one shot.
---
See, I think I have gotten better at thinking about WoW (and games in general) in the last 15 years or so. However, I am sure I am worse at playing it. My mind just does not seem as good at high-speed processing as it used to be. I have the same problem with all sorts of games now -- fighting games, platformers, and RTS being notably difficult for me now.
---
So: who is looking forward to me healing them?! =D
---
I played on a private server. Before patching to Naxx they had to tune the bosses, because it would have been way to easy for a raid that cleared AQ 40 for over a year. I think some bosses had almost double the health in the end.
---
1: Did you edit your OG comment? I'm pretty sure you only wrote Holy. Haha WOW. You edit and then write that last line!
---
2: You state that so many people don't read the posts they respond to, and then put 'Prot' in your og comment. Did YOU even read the Topic or watch the video on the topic your responding too? Esfand WAS Prot. LOL
---
3: We read your post. Thats why you have loads of downvotes. You don't mention healing gear, int, spirit or glancing blows AT ALL. If your memory is failing, perhaps scroll up?
---
4: Ditched the gear? What mindset are you in where you think he has an extra set of BiS healing gear in his bags. Like it falls of trees? This isnt bfa kid. Esfand has one set of gear and its strength related. As will EVERY leveling paladin.  Leveling Holy is dumb, and int gear at this level is mostly cloth/leather so you loose it to the healers in the group. What you dont loose isn't worth keeping based on the fact that there is so little difference between a holy paladin and a ret one at this level outside of talents. Do you even understand the game you're commenting on?
---
5: Swapping gear would only have allowed him to not go oom faster. It literally would have taken away the damage he did for extra mana. Yet they beat they fight, Just. Meaning extra mana wasn't nessisary and any damage he could do would've been better. Which is what he did..
---
6: Unless you meant Talents considering 'I actually did read your first comment'. Which would be even more hilariously bad as I said before: 2 healers is too much. It wasnt needed. What WAS needed was prot utility, and the things it allowed that group to do are SO underrated by people like you. It's sad that people with your more modern wow mindset are gonna be spouting shit like this in Classic wow. Im just glad you're getting downvoted. When your rep matters you'll learn how stuff really works.
---
7: Let me be clear. I'd take Esfand in this situation 100 times out of 100 over another Hunter.
---
But yh bud, you keep replying and editing. Your response is laughable tbh.
---
Is it Alliance only? :)
---
drop rates and respawn rates of quest mobs have 0 to do with the tuning of instanced pve content.  
---
and i guess the point about chainpulling is that these dungeons are in fact not challenging.  the big circle jerk on this sub is that the live game has been some sort of cakewalk since about 2008 or so.  Classic was in reality very simple and with a modern perspective there isn't a whole lot to challenge the player other than RNG nonsense like chains of misses or crushing blows.  There's not really anything going on mechanically in the dungeons and not that much to think about in the raids.
---
Of course, how could you otherwise jump down from roof and cap?
---
There used to be an excellent addon for that, and I'm sure there will be again.
---
People can make creative features without doing things that veer into DMCA territory :) I could care less if someone made a filtered list of items or a map with NPCs. There are many different types of fansites for BFA, including other databases, that coexist that don't cross lines. Classicdb recently added features that really push things farther, like the mirrored guides and making Wowhead foot the bill for their image hosting. Would rather see people doing something innovative with a database, creating their own guides, model viewer etc.
---
Either way group content should be buffed. What these Asmon runs have showed us, if anything, is that challenging content with Vanilla's mechanics can be a lot of fun. Unfortunately though, same-level content will be a cakewalk for the average player of 2019. Private servers had buffed dungeons and raids and it was very well received by the community, including Nost, which represented the casual community as much as it did the hardcore community.
---
Yeah I think people are focusing way too much on the fantasy aspect. 
---
We can suspend our disbelief on races because that's so foreign we don't even consider it. But playing the opposite gender that actually exists definitely makes some people think twice about it. 
---
Which is fine, it's okay to have feelings. Don't let people shame you for not being "woke" and doing something you're not comfortable with.
---
Yeah, as a matter of fact I am a bit disappointed as well.

Atm I´m playing Ascension wow which is this classless realm! Quite good fun and a good alternative. 
---
Super ready for release though!!! HYPE!
---
First of all, you will need another twinks to heal. Healing random low-gear dudes is useless.
---
And the second thing, it will be fun only if you are fighting against other twink team.
---
You can. Only the ramp room and tunnel count as indoors.
---
I love these types of quests myself.
---
I don’t know what patch it would be on, but by the 1.12 patch a lot of rough edges had been sanded down.
---
Love this and you explained it perfectly, I feel exactly the same way. I think I might just resub and see if I can find a bunch of people that just enjoy chill m+ runs (at a semi-decent speed) while i wait for classic (hey I might get beta access as well lol).
---
Also, class balance is all over the place, a hunter one shotting Nefarian, get out of here with that shit. Rogue killing a Death Knight with one Sinister Strike with an off-hand dagger? Literally unplayable.
---
GIRL in fantasy mmo-s means Guy In Real Life
---
Bro, it's in the beta already, in case you didn't realize
---
I agree.
---
It's a good thing we actually have a beta, but as far as I know all the characters will be reset to lvl 1 as soon as Classic launches. Why would I want to play my character to lvl 30, just to lose all the progress afterwards? Feels like a waste of time.
---
it depends what level bracket.  I've only twinked at level 19 and 49.  As a Pally in level 19, it was great and was hard to kill. 
---
This is a good wee thread on twinking :D

"Hunters can't even use shields!"
---
"Not with that attitude they can't!"
---
I still go by this quote heh. Mains are always females. Some alts are male though.
---
Thank you for your very good and detailed answers
---
Level 60 and working on preraid bis and attunments
---
That's called clickbait.
---
Show him some awesome oldschool PVP Videos so he learns a bit about the mechanics and builds up HYPE!
---
&gt; drop rates and respawn rates of quest mobs have 0 to do with the tuning of instanced pve content.
---
Yes they do. These limit leveling speed, and lower the pool of available buddies at higher levels to help out in the lower level content.
---
Again, most people (including the Classic Fans) forget that fight mechanics are only a small part of Classic.
---
How many Druids do you think you should bring?
---
Yas! N8elf and Human both female!
---
The people in this thread need to calm down. Not everyone feels comfortable playing the opposite gender and it's funny that people who do are the ones saying how it doesn't matter but are hounding people about not being comfortable with something that doesn't affect them. 
---
Welcome to World of Tumblrcraft
---
Or from hunter pets :-)
---
So you can see the sky from the flag room which would count as outdoors by the other guys criteria but you can’t mount in there so it’s not outdoors?
---
Umm.....if you ask 1000 people what faction they will be playing and 490 say alliance, your conclusion is correct. How the fuck can it "turn out" to be 48%? I would say you are correct with your initial findings because arithmetic is a thing.
---
As simple as writing "search term --streamername". You knew what you were doing and the comments in this thread echo that
---
&gt; What you're saying is not true. Legion wasn't a huge piece of garbage in 7.1.5. as BfA is now
---
That is what you recall as your own oppinion/your own experience. If you'd look on the internet, the situation was pretty much close to what it is today - a ton of shitting on Blizzard for this and that (and it's a really big list of "this and that"). I don't want to go into "but this is 97% garbage and that one before was only 75% garbage - there were unhappy voices calling the game shit/worst xpac just the same as with every expansion, including the current one). I don't particularly like BfA (I did massively liked the leveling experience, tho, the art, the zones, the music and the voiceovers) and I don't try to do anything **but** to show that the exact (or in specific cases, oddly enough, even worse!) shit we got during Legion (through all of its length), in MoP and in WoD (and let's not talk about Cata and WotLK that "destroyed the game").
---
&gt; I'm sorry but if you think people will have great memories a few years about BfA you're delusional.
---
I don't even try to imply that, just to point out that it was pretty much like this in every single expansion in the last decade, literally one after another. That this will be remembered as the worst, it very well could be it. It's just that so were many before i, which is quite an irony. If we'd made a "worst of the worst wow xpacs" vote, the current xpac would win as the worst in most cases.
---
&gt; I don't remember people saying it was the worst expansion.
---
I do. You can even Google for some results that are still left out there ("legion worst expansion"), but that's just a small part of it. If you'd read the forums, reddit, discord or watch the popular Twitch streamers through Legion you'd see how pissed a ton of people were about the game, quitting left and right, sick of farming AP, legendaries, sick of this and that - for me that didn't mattered, I enjoyed its leveling experience, leveling alts and goldmaking - and in BfA it's pretty close in these regards; I was farming old content for transmog because I had nothing to do in the game in Legion just the same as I do it now in BfA.
---
Let's not forget that the shitstorm hit BfA with the Blizzcon fiasco of Diablo for mobile, that's where the media and the collective/the internet went crazy, in an all-anti-Blizzard spree and because Blizzard didn't do much (or rather, anything) to address it, it could have very well cemented it forever that Blizzard = garbage and so on. That the 2 new features of the expansion (warfronts and island expeditions) are not considered to be fun by a big portion of the playerbase is not the reason BfA is considered as failed (the features are still popular now 9 months after launch, oddly enough).
---
&gt; Also 2004 pservers? And you were playing them just fine? Because from what I remember the first pservers were beyond unplayable.
---
They were 'playable', but stuff was broken (more than half of the quests were broken/could not be finished, entire systems were not working - ingame mail was not working, talents were not working, interactive items for quests were not working etc), character were usually wiped at max 3-4 months if you were lucky or 1-2 weeks for the worst servers (what I mean by that is not intentionally wiped, but the "oh shit server crashed and we lost the database" was a rather frequent theme). There were servers with x60 amount of XP (ppl would just farm Deadwind Pass mobs with the help of a lvl 60 player in order to level themselves to 60 in a few hours).
---
But it was **free** and that was what mattered by far the most (also for a few months period it was the only way we could play wow in EU, because it wasn't officially launched until spring 2015). That's why we've had WoD, MoP, Legion and now we even have BfA private servers (the lulz!), because they're free - the experience is not anywhere close to the Blizz one, but it's free and this is a huge appeal for many, but especially those who don't want to invest much time into it or those in poor countries/that can't afford a subscription.
---
I’m not upset, I’m just confused as I never thought twice about the gender of my character
---
Crazy? Yes. Impossible? No.   
---
Personally I expect a rag kill in the 2nd ID.
---
Honestly, I think he should just go in blind. Everything he needs to know (race class, discriptions) are in game.
---
at least 2 for bres and innervate
---
depends on raid and how efficient the raid is
---
Even if there is no answer, your answers helped a lot to get more insight into classic PvP to get a better feel of what happend.
---
 Who is a paper to which rock and so on
---
Deadmines?
---
I guess I just never experienced women being fundamentally different than men
---
It’s a know  bug in the beta. You obviously can’t use travel form in the flag room.
---
The point isn't to find out exactly what faction 1000 people will be rolling, it's to get an idea of what faction EVERYONE will be rolling.
---
I swear you've got to be trolling me. No one is this dense.
---
No he didn’t. It’s a bug.
---
Alright cool, it still makes no sense to me but that’s okay
---
Thats what progression is. That's called exploring new worlds and stories in the universe
---
14 years later... Horde Argent Dawn EU and I recognize some of the names here. Its crazy how special this game is
---
Still waiting for the explanation how that constitutes an act of hate.
---
Sorry that you get triggered if your idol is not mentioned in the most favorable light everytime his name pops up somewhere, but that's really your problem, not ours.

STVietnam will happen

Dual spec makes things easier and cheaper. It removes hard choices from the game. You don't to think were are you putting your points (do you lean more to pvp, pve or maybe a hybrid is an option). You believe it is good to have this as an option? It is not. You don't see how badly this affects every aspect of the game. Thinking like that created BFA and every expansion before. You should not be trying to make the game easier, because that is not how great games are made. Learn to work with limits you have.
---
Bring back Spelladin!
---
I ran an RFD group that could not find a healer. So we just tried it without. Ended up clearing the instance. Healthstones, potions and bandages got us a long way.
---
WASD over ESDF is one of the great historical tragedies of PC gaming.  I remember when I first played Tribes, which defaulted to ESDF and was blown away by how much better it was to keep your hand in the natural typing position and have easy access to the whole left side of the keyboard.  But the immense popularity of the Quake engine games (Quake, Quake 2, Half Life, Half Life 2, Counterstrike) made it so that the vast majority of gamers got accustomed to WASD and made it the expected default.
---
Can you think of any reasons off the top of your head why more than one druid doesn't have much place in a horde raid in particular?
---
It also means forcing players into more cookie cutter builds (or classes for that matter) which isnt good for the game.
---
ignore the retail troglodytes.
---
you have to prepare, socialize, gear up, farm consumables, and spend gold in the live game too unless we're just talking about LFR or something.  Leveling was a non issue in classic, you could be done with it in under a month even with no freaking idea what you were doing to start out with, and in about 6 days played once you knew a half decent route (my best was around 4 days with a frost mage).  
---
I wouldn't call pretty much any of those difficulty, they're a mix of grinding and spending time on recruitment.  That's the boring stuff.  I also think people are tossing the word "simulator" around a lot for some bizarre reason....a raid is not a raid simulator, it is a raid.
---
Hey maybe it's not too late. Still a few months of beta left. Fingers crossed that the nochanges crowd will come around by then.
---
True there will probably be a list at some point. But I think that you will be very much affected. Because the fans will cluster around them.. so as usually it's the fans that will be a problem. But yeah only time will tell
---
Troll Shaman for the awesome /sit fishing on the water. Indubitably God Tier fisherman.
---
Shamans get their version of what?
---
Asmon was level 25 and others also weren't all 30, also the comparison was made with level 24-25 elites right before the last boss and they were hitting like wet noodles. Arugal is the strongest boss of all the low level dungeons and the only one with actual mechanics and he was one shot by a keyboard turning clicker who was sheeped by the mage...
---
But that clip is sped up though?
---
If I run MC on my retail main (essentally Optimus Prime vs schoolgirls) it take like 15 minutes just running through the place.
---
i just base it off what my class is gonna be and which race i think looks best as that class.
---
my main is gonna be a Priest and i'm gonna roll Alliance. i think Female Night Elves have the best casting animations and also look great in the tier gear, so, it's an easy choice.
---
Mage and Warlock have near identical pre-BIS lists save for shoulders.
---
And if you run out of bait you can just dig around in your rib cage a bit.
---
In favour of Alliance, if history is any indication.
---
[This one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j81TgG0p_HrYKajiUiQfYIoSUx1culzy2u_Fc4wtiS8/edit#gid=87065170) is back from the nost days, shows all the options you have which are viable. Hope this helps.
---
Sure is. We can't really be both :)
---
Yeah it's crazy how I still remember pointless stuff like Tethtoril the Human Mage being server first 60 and then Jin the Tauren Druid (?) being number 2.
---
I also remember getting vastly unpopular in certain RP groups of the Alliance because I "sold out the Alliance for 10 silver" when crafting the server first Sulfuras for Avolc the Tauren Warrior and trading it to her through the Booty Bay Auction House, as I was the only one with the recipe and high enough blacksmithing.
---
Yes he did. No it's not.
---
Layering is going to be awful. How will the auction house function? Will each layer share the same AH? If not then that opens a whole new set of problems. What about World PVP? What about node farming?
---
Increase of the Ignore list!
---
PoE next league will hold me for a month. Later... we will see.
---
And then in Cata they made them harder again, kinda funny.
---
It's still there!  It's just in the Google Doc.  I had to remove a few links from the main Reddit post to get under the character max, and the meme specs were the first to go.
---
It’s just because when they said get ready for a classic summer people assumed it would be a bjg chunk of summer. Not just the last  quarter of summer.  A lot of us are in professional schools. Oh well.
---
Classic is very alt-friendly, once you got a main that can farm decent amount of money your alt can be pimped with nice gear and enchant
---
Easy solution, just roll on an RP server.
---
No streamer is going to be roleplaying their character, so bam you've just avoided all of them.
---
This is the real reason why we need Rp-PvP servers, PLEASE BLIZZARD
---
Warcraft 3 is also a skin on top of existing structure. They mentioned at blizzcon they had to use the same amount of animations for the new models, since they were bound to the restrictions of the original engine.
---
You're the one triggered by a running joke in this reddit mate

I'm doing the same, and Kinda narrowed it down to :-

Whatever is closest to Thrall model.
---
I hope that is sarcasm...
---
Why didn't you state that then?
---
holy crap! is this a trick question lois?
---
the answer is druids are worthless at everything other than battle ressing and innervating
---
I believe that the new models override the old ones. A toggle was originally the plan in WoD but that toggle just stretched the old skins over the new models and looked horrific.
---
So i think its actually not possible to do this... sadly
---
Dunce.
---
Cata Heroics were like TBC heroics, which were more difficult than vanilla dungeons.  Vanilla dungeons were like WotLK Heroics.
---
I’ve read comments here that this is not true on the beta.
---
Ofcause... dohhh! Just read your post again. Sorry :)
---
It is "easy" when you absurdly overgear the content by taking every possible world buff (which wasn't even possible in Vanilla) and forcing raid members to use every available consumable (which also wasn't possible). 
---
Besides, Blizzard confirmed that pservers got bosses stats completely wrong. Pservers used templates for bosses. Meanwhile it turned out every boss had unique stats, including armor and resistances.
---
Negative. Should be available on launch, especially if the rest of our devs get in the stress test. Only 2 of us have Beta accounts, so it makes it difficult.
---
Quantum computers might be able to do that.
---
people are misplacing their anger. it is not the streamers that everyone should be mad about...
---
It is blizzard who prioritizing advertising over testing in their "beta access"
---
WTF do you want a streamer who gets access to beta to do? call blizzard and say i don't deserve it ? None of us would ever do that if we got access to beta and our neighbor or friend who played before us did not get it.
---
I am not fan of streamers, my connection is too slow to even watch twitch on anything above 360p so i do not bother 99% of the time. I hate the "influencer" tag that is being bestowed on those streamers. However, the whole anger toward streamers is fueled by jealousy not logic and its pathetic. Think before getting emotional and understand who is at fault here. if you don't think that blizzard is at fault then shut up and wait for release.
---
Great job! Does it work with wands?
---
There's been a lot of screenshots here that I've loved but for some reason this one hit me in the feels and I don't know why! Good memories man. 
---
Cannot wait to jump back in
---
Sure.  There's a reason ClassicDB uses a Swiss TLD and hosts in Sweden.
---
Ah that’s good that people know about it. It must have been reported by now
---
Because I assumed you had some common sense. You know what they say about arguing with fools? Yeah, I'm done.
---
&gt;he biggest question, what about the people (like myself) who have already redeemed these codes on retail WoW?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I'll leave those 
---
Worth holding onto in case there's a TBC Classic I guess!
---
The beta has shown us that everything is harder on Pservers.
---
people very surprised that someone crafted mooncloth chest(?)
---
Sometimes it gets really ridiculous. In wotlk I played a frost DK and I had the optimal spec according to guides, but for one point I had a different opinion for a minor talent point. Incredibly minor, to be exact. So I was applying for a raid group and the leader said that I should pick the "more optimal" talent. Seriously, the difference if there even was any was probably below 1% in terms of DPS.
---
I explained my reasoning behind the change and got accepted anyways, because he actually did not know much about DKs. So it was a bullshit discussion anyways
---
Reading through the 1.11 patch notes out of curiosity, it doesn't mention many nerfs to much of anything. Either you're thinking about a different patch, or...
---
It's not my problem if you dont know how to Google vr sickness
---
wrath ? kinda far fetched.
---
Its in wrath that threat became irrelevant and aoe dps become the meta in dungeons
---
?? isnt the cast time 2 seconds and then u can have talent for it that can reduce it by 1 or 2 seconds?
---
It doesn't take that long for an Undead to get to the Orc/Troll starting zone if you do want to be one &amp; still level with your bf. There's a zepellin that travels from The Undercity to Orgrimmar, you can get it as early as level 1 if you really wanted (although getting to around lvl 10 in the Undead starting zone first may be better).
---
It needs a comeback
---
Because a lot of us are In professional/grad programs and when they announced a “classic summer” it made it seem as if we would be able to play for a good chunk of the summer..not when 3/4 of the summer is already over. Keep it in your pants bud you seem pretty toxic as well.
---
Can anyone actually explain how they'll solve these issues? Go ahead. How will they fix the AH problem? How will they actually fix changing layers rapidly? You'll have to have some ability to change layers especially if you want to play with friends that inevitably will be on different layers. How will they actually prevent this from being abused?
---
Just stating "Oh they'll fix it" isn't a good response. Trusting Blizzard blindly is a horrible idea.
---
What else is a deviantart search doing on your start bar tho.
---
So you have been calling me an idiot and a moron but still assumed I had common sense?
---
&gt;you have to prepare, socialize, gear up, farm consumables, and spend gold in the live game too.
---
No, I really don't.
---
I can enter the game with a fresh account, buy a boost, finish leveling, use LFD until I hit a high enough ilvl, and then use LFR.
---
I don't have to farm anything, talk to anyone, read any guides, join any guild. And I still get to see the entirety of what the game tells me is it's main content. The only difference is, that it says "LFR" on my gear instead of "Mythic", and that it has a lower itemlevel. Do people care about that? No. LFR is the single most played endgame content.
---
In fact, I don't even have to actually play the game. Don't believe me? [Preach shall prove it to you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFWh9aY4pas)
---
&gt;I wouldn't call pretty much any of those difficulty, they're a mix of grinding and spending time on recruitment.
---
That is because your definition of "difficulty" is limited to the mechanical skill. WoW Classic is not a game I play for a mechanical challenge. It's a game I play to spend time in a fantasy RPG world with lik-minded players.
---
&gt;That's the boring stuff. 
---
It may be to you. To me, it's an enjoyable experience, much better than what Retail offers me. If you think Classic is boring, play something else.
---
&gt;I also think people are tossing the word "simulator" around a lot for some bizarre reason....a raid is not a raid simulator, it is a raid.
---
The single most played game mode in Retail right now, and for the last few expansions, has been, and will continue to be, LFR. LFR is a raid simulator.
---
While I had tons of fun with my guild through the years, this one is probably one of my favourite memories from Vanilla. It shows how all the first people to hit level 60 found each other through the great community of the server and became friends "despite" being in different guilds.
---
Yo, i'm part of the ret theorycrafting squad and raided CE mythic in Legion. On beta, we're currently blowing past the private server ret build and based on tested mechanics, ret will be able to more than double all dps checks with only 2 consumables, with our current build. 
---
Yeah, hybrids are generally fine, the game just isn't hard enough for them not to be. The issue is that the viability of a lot of hybrid classes is knowledge gated and somewhat unintuative. It's quite possible for a hybrid player to be dogshit if they don't keep up, whereas a pure DPS class has very focused and straightforward gearing and stat priorities. Even the bad hybrids should be able to meet dps checks if they have a decent set of gear of some kind.
---
Ele and boomkin are the only two specs that I can't really redeem, but I'm not a player of either and am no expert. I like melee to much to give it up.
---
Uh we got jubeithos in Jan 2006

Executioner bro..

I am familiar with that term
---
How will they stop it from being abused. You'll HAVE to be able to switch layers somehow if you want to play with friends that will inevitably be on different layers. This is going to be abused to high hell.
---
definitely*
---
Hasn't been a secret for 14 years.
---
Just do it. It will be a fun learning experience. Just expect douches, but you'll get douches regardless of if you're tank, dps or heals so it doesn't really matter.
---
Once you learn the dungeons it's fun to go through them and improve on your tanking. If you're casual, being tank is the best because you won't waste 1-2 hours looking for one. :P
---
Ooo shit thats good, zoom in for full cream effect
---
WC and Deadmines are no joke, no one has their core kit yet so you lose aggro, poor heals, lack of cc, lack of oh-shit buttons and lack of armour make you eat ass the whole time.
---
dude... just Walking through empty mc should take around 10 minutes...
---
On the contrary, average player will be significantly worse, because modern gamers aren't used to games like Vanilla WoW (they require completely different set of skills than most modern games).
---
You are also arguing with a guy that says he is bring LFR to classic.
---
You don't have to spend time on making a weakaura.  
---
On that subject, did they confirm weakaura's will be coming to classic?
---
Layering will be gone after P1, no matter what. If there is gonna be a mega server it is going to have a mega queue. Most likely solution will be free server transfers.
---
Even if crusader strike did 100% weapon damage, and had like a 6 second cool down, Ret would still probably be at the bottom of the DPS meter lol. I still want them to fix feral. Make weapon damage actually affect DPS. Right now it's just a stat stick so everyone else gets priority on weapons over feral, and the best weapon is a level 29. I'm OK with having worse DPS as a hybrid, but when you have like half of what mages, rogues, and warriors have it's a little messed up. Same as Ret.
---
It's not that simple. Mind Flay's snare causes additional threat.
---
Doesn't change shit for the deadmines and people still complained about it.
---
Looks like a bug to me
---
Okay, I see this conversation is going nowhere useful. Good bye, I won't be hearing from you again.
---
6+ of your healers have ahnk and half of your raid is in chain heal bounce range. Hots don't stack. Shamans have ancestral fortitude + mana tide totem. When comparing shaman vs druid, you are trading decreased healing efficiency for a battle rez. Add in regular totems and...is it worth? Not so much.
---
That’s not right. There may be a delay but that’s just due to latency.
---
Looks like a bug to me. I don’t think you can mount there
---
In Classic you gear in dungeons to be stronger out in the world.
---
It's not my problem you misunderstand the concept of who is trying to convince who here.
---
Yes ;)
---
I wasn't surprised. I was just congratulating him on finally getting a Robe (the Magisters Robe), but then I realized he did have the Mooncloth one.

Oh ya, I member.

Inspired by the heroic actions of [**Fuel Rats**](https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Rats) group in [**Elite: Dangerous**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Dangerous), &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; exists with the sole purpose of helping others in World of Warcraft: Classic.
---
&gt;Well, what is **Fuel Rats** and what is **Elite: Dangerous**?
---
Elite Dangerous is a space-flight simulation game in which the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy (yes, literally 1:1 scale). Since the Milky Way is mind-bogglingly huge, it is not unusual for space explorers to get carried away and end up stranded somewhere in the void with no fuel. When this happens to you, your only way of getting back is if someone manages to find and reach you to transfer fuel.  
---
This is where Fuel Rats come in. These are a group of volunteers who literally go above and beyond to help out their fellow players. There is no in-game system for this, mind you. So each and every member of this selfless organisation help out others through their own means. Their longest rescue mission consisted of five Fuel Rats members finding Commander "Deluvian", a stranded pilot who is 65,788 lightyears from Sol. [**The combined journey took 600 (actual) hours.**](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/18/elite-dangerous-rescue-mission-commander-deluvian/)  
---
It would be an understatement to say how devoted these players are just to help out someone else.
---
Our goal is to provide a similar helpful environment in WoW: Classic. With the help of some [**Goblin Rocket Fuel**](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9061/goblin-rocket-fuel), anything is possible.
---
**Our guild ideology**
---
We have one goal; helping out any adventurers we come across. Some will come to us for help, but we should always be open to seeking out others who may be in need. Your level, equipment or the amount of wealth matters not. What matters is a healthy and friendly attitude. We do not have set roles for our members (PvE helper, PvP helper, crafter etc.) because we want you to be exemplary members of the Horde; no matter the activity. We only expect you to be kind to others, guild members and non-guildies alike.  
---
As long as you wear the &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; guild tag, you should always remember that you are representing this guild with your actions. Treat others the way you'd want them to treat you; don't ninja loot, don't spam the chat, help out low level players in quests and dungeons, give them food and potions and buffs, and perhaps some 6-8 slotted bags etc.  
---
\----------------  
---
**Guild Events; it's not just helping but also having fun!**
---
Helping out others is not the only reason for our existance; obviously we should be able to enjoy the game on our own as well.  
---
Such as;
---
* 5 man dungeon runs (leveling dungeons, max level dungeons)
---
* World PvP
---
* Molten Core / ZG / AQ20 / BWL / Onyxia runs should be doable with enough people. AQ40/Naxx is not on our scope.
---
* Attunement/key runs
---
* Some light Battlegrounds (when they are released)
---
* "Fuel Runs" where we go out to the wild and help random players
---
**Epilogue; closing thoughts**
---
A little background on myself; I've played WoW almost religiously starting from final stages of Vanilla all throughout Wotlk and beginning of MoP. I did almost everything aside from AQ40/Naxx and PvP ranking. Much like many returning players, this time around I'm too old/busy to have a similar playstyle. Instead I just want to kick back with some friends, and enjoy mainly the social aspect of WoW. I will most likely be tanking 5-mans and offering free food/portals/enchant services on a mage alt as well.  
---
The reason I wanted to start this guild is to provide a friendly environment. If I can make one person happy, that's a good day for me. I'm also starting this guild on (Oceanic) PvP server so with some luck I can take revenge on that level 55 gnome rogue who is harrassing those poor level 30's.  
---
Feel free to contact me on here via a PM, or on Discord. I feel like I'm a bit old for Discord, but that seems to be the #1 tool to gather players (and also a great upgrade to Ventrillo) so we have a bare-bones server as well.  
---
I will update this post as I get more time on my hands with additional information such as member count, raiding times (when applicable) etc. For now, think of us as a mainly helping social guild that does extra activities as well!  
---
Thanks for your time.
---
If my chosen races are orc, tauren, dwarf, troll or undead I'll prefer a male character. Female for the rest.
---
Someone explain how this will be fixed.Go ahead. How will they fix the AH problem? How will they actually fix changing layers rapidly? You'll have to have some ability to change layers especially if you want to play with friends that inevitably will be on different layers. How will they actually prevent this from being abused?
---
needing 40 hours to down rag for a group of people who have been raiding much harder content for 13 years and have 15 years of knowing exactly how to do rag (put your back to a wall and kill some adds....and that's the fight) is ridiculous.  The whole raid is going to go down in a couple hours as soon as anybody gets in there.
---
Unless he lives in the UK, we can't get hot pockets over here :(
---
&gt;comparing a healer being able to resurrect themselves to being able to instantly resurrect up a tank or a key player during combat
---
bruh moment
---
Omfg, at one point literally every second word was an emojie gif from all my friends
---
Didn't he delete his paladin already?
---
Yeah, thats the conventional wisdom at least. At the same time, i couldn't tell you how many times ive heard conventional wisdom or read class guides that had things completely wrong.  
---
I didn't state anything as a fact, i wasn't trying to, and i thought i made it clear.  
---
but, downtime? what downtime? warriors should have next to zero downtime, in either playstyle.  
---
also, what kind of a jackass would use diff power level weapons and call it a test. come on man.
---
can you play hamstring kite wrong? lol  
---
In the end, he's practicing and having an awful time. I just offered another option for him to try. Maybe he can make it faster on avg kill time, maybe its comparable, or maybe its more fun and just feels faster. Was just something for him to try. It made a world of difference to me. Again, i'm claiming nothing as a fact, just offering another option for him to try.  
---
my guesses as to why i felt it was faster, or at least comparable...  
---
the absolutely stupid amounts of rage. shout never falls. rend is always up. there so much excess you can use tclap for it instant dmg(and the utility of course, since you are in there) more chances at overpower procs. always have rage for an execute on time.
---
I beg to differ face stomping none twinks is the best just 1-2 autos and ded
---
hmm, didnt consider that actually also i didnt realize that snare could do threat :/
---
Whole world? Caverns of Tiiiiiiiime! I don't know about your way to play the game, but world PvP was alive, especially in azeroth. Raids on capital cities, small ganks which turned into massive fights because everyone got their guild to help them.
---
Old school raids for fun. Etc. You were stuck bc no imagination and noob.
---
If every class one shot everything with whatever gear, I call that balance. They all do the same things, it's just too easy.
---
No, you don't get the funny part is that Sony is a little bitch.
---
I dont think you've realized that theorycrafting has mitigated all of these issues. If a player is good they will be at the top with the other good players. A guild does not have 40 good players, you might have 15 good players at max. A good ret paladin in preraid bis can do upwards of 500 dps with current builds. 
---
The difference between prepared and unprepared matters a FUCK ton more than your class choice in 2019. Many of the core classes don't have gimicks, but a lot of the less represented classes have had undiscovered gimicks and tricks that a ton of people didn't know about or didn't use. The meta isn't stagnant and good play has always mattered more than class choice. Do you take billy the retarded daggers rogue who raids in PvP spec and dies to fire or do you take the best ret paladin on your server? Because the former is fundimentally unavoidable in classic raiding guilds, outside of top .5% play. Revolving door rosters are a problem even for naxx guilds, so you cant be picky enough to get good players. If you get a good player on a bad spec, you damn well better keep them because they're leagues better than a stupid fuck on a meta class.
---
but then if we think that way, a naxx group would be only mages and warriors as dps. why bring in rogues or warlocks (get 1 lock only)?
---
you don't need to be reasonably geared. MC didn't have enrage timers, you just go in there and hit the thing til it's dead.
---
Your argument might hold water if shooters weren't also old as fuck.
---
&gt; I was sad to gear up as a bear just to realize I wasn’t allowed to raid as feral, even as a cat
---
"Even as a cat" is not how it works. Bears can outperform warrior tanks on some fights and be arguably similar on the others. Cats won't outperform good rogues even if they spam MCP like crazy.
---
I do think with a bit of luck you'd be allowed to be a bear or bear/cat.
---
Everyone thinks its in some clever deep folder
---
Yeah, calculating threat is a bitch in Vanilla/Classic because it doesn't show up in combat logs. You have to do manual testing of every ability/talent/etc against a known threat-generating ability. It's why Threat Meters in Vanilla were constantly being updated, sometimes multiple times a day. The values were manually entered.
---
Oh my comment got removed for listing a private server but you can  message me also I may have a crap Druid you can play
---
Not really right? Different necks, boots, wand. Some argument for chest, rings aswell. And the head is crafted.
---
Im starting to be suspicious, im starting to think blizz is throwing these out of their asses. I honestly doubt they have a 1.12 client to check from. Can they show us this mystery 1.12 client they take their info's from?
---
Classic releases on my second day of classes next semester.
---
I only want TBC so we can eventually have WotLK.
---
Yup. Sad to see the community go from #Nochanges to accepting "layering" (sharding) blindly. Truly shows how gullible people are. Sad shit.
---
hunters are good in t1 pve raids.
---
t2 they are fair.
---
only on t3 they becomes quite low on dps charts (around shadow priests level).
---
however in world pvp and bgs they are good, gold farming and leveling they are nb 1.
---
Best troll too
---
That one might have been open source, cause I remember seeing it on all the MMO I played back then.
---
Hillary didn't let anyone die, and the entire Trump organization is doing the same thing with their emails
---
a lot of people are deluded like that.  this sub is thick with it.  everything in vanilla was very hardcore you see.

hide cloaks ftw
---
Thanks! There's some alternatives there that can be useful.
---
Yep that’s what a correct opinion looks like
---
Most underrated answer
---
Warriors should be significantly easier to gear in Classic than they are on private servers due to BiS until AQ40 items being available before BWL is even out (Savage Gladiator Chain, R12/13 1.12 PvP Gear, Diamond Flask) and Blizzard not banning for Onyxia gear multiplying like private servers do.
---
This easier gearing of Warriors makes Rogues less needed 
---
Priests are on the low end of recommended based on the assumption that private servers buffed damage and boss armor to compensate for 1.12 while Classic will use the actual values
---
3 Hunters is the recommended number that I have always seen and see no reason why it would be wrong
---
1 Resto Druid is the recommended number for horde. I guess you could have a Feral Druid too if you wanted.
---
Oh it will
---
Mm ye I forgot about DM being gated. Although I wouldn't expect it to be gated for long. 4 months is Blizzlike. I'd expect 2-3 on Classic.
---
that adds up to the rejuv on you doing 32% overheal instead of 33% overheal.
---
I have a signed note from my mom that says I did those things!
---
I don’t really care either way if people lie about it or not, it doesn’t change my experience of vanilla, if someone wants to try to share that, that’s fine as long as they’re not being a prick.
---
It’s also hard for me to say where we stopped exactly, we cleared c'thun (Balnazar server first!), and I’m 99% certain we cleared Aracnid, 75% we cleared Plague, 50% we cleared construct, and I know we never killed 4 horsemen.  But since they redid Naxx in WotLK, all my raiding experience bleeds together and I just don’t remember.
---
# Bifrost – Alliance PvP – EU CET
---
**Introduction**
---
We’re a bunch of older gamers, most have played the game since it’s launch in 2005. With being older comes different responsibilities and as such we’re way less strict and hardcore. Adding to the fact that Classic is fairly simplistic in it’s raid designs, we can go about it with a relaxed attitude. Most of us are above 30 years old and although not a requirement, we’re likely not the ideal home for very young players. Most of us are scandinavians but we’ll keep the comms in English.
---
**So what’s it all about?**
---
Well, we want to continue our gaming community, bring back friends of old and make new ones on the way. We plan on tackling all kinds of content in the game at our own pace. This means that we’ll likely not be server first to kill Ragnaros or Kel’thuzad, but we will get there eventually. We want to enjoy all aspects of classic, so most of us will likely take our time leveling to experience all the dungeons and cool outdoor zones like Jin’thalor as well.
---
**Requirements?**
---
Well, nothing really. As long as you’re a positive fella and if you choose to come to a raid, make sure you put in your best effort. We’re not going to require any specific outside farming, specs or anything like that. You can play a shadow priest, feral druid or anything else weird as long as you show up and add to the fun, rather than subtract from it.
---
**Guild structure**
---
This is still up in the air. We’re currently just above 20 people confirmed, so the guild structure is still being worked on. Loot system is not yet locked down either, but expect a transparent loot system whatever we choose to work with.
---
**Raid schedule**
---
None decided. Expect 1-3 events per week that you are free to come to if you wish. No attendance required but we will try to have a large enough roster so that we can continously run 40-man raids 1-2 nights per week.
---

I've been looking at a 0/22/29 Shaman build.  Far enough into the Enhancement tree to grab Improved Weapon Totems for totem twisting, and enough Resto talents to spam Chain Heal like a boss.
---
Nope.
---
Yeah some quests just arent worth it. If It's too camped or if the named doesnt pop after a 30min search, just grind while being lfg and go on. I see too many people camping the same spots for dozen of minutes on P's...
---
In these cases I'll keep the quest and check back later until I outlevel it then I hit abandon quest.
---
If I need the reward Ill camp though.
---
meh, i've done all im going to do, it either happens or it doesnt.
---
What a reply. Is this the Asman army? He was only dueling, no interaction. Just watch the video
---
Back when people used demonslaying enchants because it looked cool, nice
---
&gt; (they require completely different set of skills than most modern games).
---
Eh. It mostly just requires more grinding and time commitment. It's not mechanically complex in the slightest. On the contrary, it's incredibly basic.
---
The only addon I would be against is Questie because there are people who want to play without it, for the rest I agree with you.
---
I had mine hidden deep in the Skyrim files under terrain textures or some lie like that.
---
You are doing what is destined, and that is destiny fulfilled.
---
&gt;or is even possible
---
It's not, the warlock petnames are purely random.
---
yes
---
Where can we see this mysterious Blizzard build? Im starting to become suspicious
---
Sorry for the stupid question, but are these mods?
---
&gt; MCCC, Wicked Whims, Extreme Violence, and Basemental 
---
I installed it the other day for my gf, but your points sound interestind
---
Volchan has great abilities that would look great on screen. A huge fire AOE, a kickback, stomps, cool shit IMO
---
been playing a lot of classic games until then. Played diablo 1 for the first time and replayed d2. I can't believe how much better they are than d3.
---
Also been playing baldur's gate for the first time and I have baldur's gate 2 sitting in my steam inventory for when I'm done.
---
Damn that sucks I know they did at one point but I think they stopped due to sales
---
When he said you think you do, he never ever referred to the difficulty of the game.
---
&gt; Beta is correct, elites hit for the right amount and basicaly vanilla dungeons are a walk in the park... 
---
The first 2 statements are correct, the last one not so much. Yes, beta is correct and elites hit for the right amount. However, Vanilla dungeons are a walk in the park for GOOD players...EVERYTHING, in ANY GAME, is a walk in the park for good players.
---
However, most players are BAD players. This can be seen in virtually every single game. When Asmongold went with a raid to Deadwind Pass, and tanked those birds...1/3rd of the melees were attacking the mob from the front. That sums up how BAD those melee guys were. The Warlocks and Mages opened up with dots and arcane missiles, proving how BAD they were, because dots and arcane missiles have HUGE aggro...and the tank didn't even managed to land a sunder.
---
In modern WoW, there are loads of people that are unable to move from shit on the ground.
---
And while you can afford to have 2 retards out of 5 in modern WoW, because nothing kills you in dungeons...in Vanilla, a single retard can fuck up the entire run.
---
And we talk about 1 hr+ dungeons, not 15 min tops, we talk about going back to town and replace the retard, not /vote kick and immediately replace it.
---
Vanilla dungeons aren't hard...if everyone is at least semi-competent. But since most ARE NOT...Vanilla dungeons will eat most PUGs for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There will be a massive amount of wipes in Vanilla 5 men dungeons.
---
Lastly, your opinion of Vanilla dungeons being a walk in the park is based on very good players running lvl 30 dungeons. Everyone knows that Sunken Temple is were players prove how good or bad they are. Not SFK or SM.
---
As for raids...well, only a small number of guilds will be able to fill up and maintain a solid group of 45-50 raiders, simply because there aren't enough good players for all guilds. Those guilds will raid Naxx.
---
The other guilds will not set foot in AQ40, being stuck in MC and BWL.
---
That’s bizarre.
---
Just quietly as well, I think that actually vanilla actually encourages alts more as each alt is like a completely different experience.
---
if you act with an obnoxious, elitists, greedy attitude for 15/h+ a day you cant really say its just an act anymore its the whole persona of that person
---
just sayin
---
Windows xp, Teamspeak 2, Halo Zero, starcraft 1 this truly reminds me of my middle school days..
---
yeah that would be so epic oh my gosh lol
---
and he would drop ONE freaking green item that no one can wear oh my gosh lol that would be so epic, imagine how much it would be worth on the ah lol? lol like 50000 gold lol
---
&gt; Rogues Warriors, Hunters and Mages may not get that special treatment but thats what you get for jumping on the dps hype train.
---
Yeah, nobody would ever play one of those classes if it wasnt for min/maxing, right?
---
I'm sure there's a way that they can edit the pet names on their end.
---
any class is easy if you make groups and dont invite classes that need your loot ;).

dont worry about the gold till you get to level 60. You dont really need to buy any gear to level. The quests rewards will give you suitable gear to get to level 60. Running instances too (while not as great XP wise as solo grinding / questing), will give you the chance for much better leveling gear which can last many levels. 
---
Take skinning and a gathering profession while leveling and vendor everything you skin, till you start getting Medium leather. Then send it all to a bank alt , and continue to level.  Same with your gathering profession, send the herbs or ore to the bank alt and worry about that much later on. 
---
The Economy will take a good while to grow. Players wont have surplus gold for many months, cos everyone wants their mount at 40 and epic as soon as reaching 60. 
---
Remember that once you are 60, you can quest for great gold, as you get more gold for quests once you are max level. Saving several regions/areas for level 60 questing is a good idea. Like silithus or WPL/EPL - there are many quests here, so you can early a massive amount of gold just continuing these quests once 60. 
---
Also, fishing/cooking can make great gold. They are quite time consuming and some find fishing boring....but the food buffs are highly desirable for raiders, and sell well on the AH. Fishing for an hour for the Stonescale eels in Tanaris, Ashara and STV can get several stacks, which sell well on the AH. 
---
My own personal plan, is to get to level 60, without buying anything I dont imperatively need. I wont visit the AH, till I am level 60, and I think that will take me 6-8 weeks from release.  Then I will have a look at all the  BOE green or hopefully blue items I have looted, and all the leather I have gather, and will then look to AH what I have...if the economy is starting to thrive.  I'll keep hold of all the herbs/ore (depending on which I decide to take).
---
Between running Instances for my BiS items required for raiding, I'll be questing in the areas I've not ventured to, and gathering as much gold as I can.  Once I have my epic mount and 400-500g surplus...I'll thinking of dropping skinning for another profession and leveling it (either using the herbs I have or the ore I have).    
---
Gold isnt hard to come by, its just time consuming. When I played hardcore back in vanilla, I used a monday evening purely for gold making, and I could easily amass 400-500g from all the mats, drops and vendor trash if I spend 4-5 hrs just grinding.
---
I will never understand people who prefer TBC PvP. It has resilience....the worse stat ever to be implemented in a video game, ever. It sucked the life out of PvP, entirely.
---
I spent all summer getting 2000 MMR for my weapon back in TBC and while it was a great memory, looking back, the PvP was horrible. PvP wasn't better in TBC, than in Vanilla - far from it.
---
&gt;vanilla is extremely boring
---
Wrong.
---
&gt;Hybrid classes are worthless other than healing. 
---
&gt;it gets old quick.
---
Very wrong.
---
&gt;PvE is a lot about consumables
---
Yeeees, and TBC totally isn't....
---
&gt;but I can’t play long without arena.
---
Then have fun in Retail.
---
that because everyone hyped warriors so much without talk about drawbacks that literally everyone thinks that warriors are the gods of vanilla as labeled in all vids. Newsflash they good but not on that level.
---
They are the worst levelers.
---
They are the best/only (in raids) tanks.
---
They have very high skill ceiling.
---
99% of the classic players will not be able to use warriors to their potential as it is quite difficult and get destroyed by every other class.
---
warriors are very average to mediocre duelers.
---
They are top dpsers in t1, t2 (slightly edging out rogues)
---
they are 2nd in dps in t3 (behind mages, slightly edging out locks)
---
As a general rule, warrior lose to all in pvp, warrior + healer (pref pala) goes from a D tier to an S tier and beat all others.
---
eu4 and new vegas, m8
---
......... lul
---
Who hurt you?
---
TBC pvp is also unbalanced.
---
You'd probably still be excited because as you slowly, slow being key, start getting the best gear you start to look like something other than a 5 year old who dressed himself for school. 
---
Plus loot really had to be shared between 40 people and not a lot dropped
---
&gt;Fuck asmongold.
---
Its the skinners, if there are more than one skinner, they roll for the chance of getting to skin the beast.
---
This. I want classic, and I want WotLK. Will still support TBC, but only in the hopes of seeing WotLK.
---
What does Trump have to do with this? Lololol.
---
Having an active subscribtion is enough if I remember correct.
---
BFA is not needed.
---
I don't know about the guy's claim about indoors/outdoors, all I'm saying is that you can see the sky from the flag room.
---
wasn't that hosted on US servers? i remember having ~200ms up until mop when they were hosted in australia and we had our own 'Oceanic' tab in the realm lists
---
Have so many of these somewhere on an old PC that I can’t boot up anymore :(
---
They didn’t show damage done back in Vanilla bg’s btw?
---
Of course there is, assuming you mean "Blizzard" when you say "their".
---
But why would they do it? It goes against 2 central policies for their vision of Classic: No changes, and no interactions with the live servers (which would hold the original pet name data).
---
Hahaha, guilty as charged.
---
You can't say this and immediately follow up with "I don't not like the guy". You're contradicting yourself.
---
It seems like you're the one with poor reading comprehension.
---
I miss spending an hour or two in AV, then logout for RL duties and then come back later to the same battle. The AV of today is just a matter of who rushes to the bosses and kills them the fastest.  
---
The whole idea of AV is completely gone and the fact that you do it with a bunch of randoms that you'll most likely never see again sucks big time.  
---
The times were I wanted something fast, I'd just queue up for WSG or AB.  
---
But looking at your posts, it seems like the "gotta go fast"-players are the only ones that matter.
---
Yeah, I have to be careful with this stuff. Probably going to just batch cook 2 weeks of healthy stuff I can throw in the microwave.
---
That's looking really, really neat.
---
However, please help out a noob... other than eyecandy, what is it actually good for? 
---
I get the autoshot-bar for hunters. That's actually doing something useful be telling me when not to interrupt my autoshot. But swing-timers? 
---
In contrast to hunter autoshots, swings are instants and even work while moving. Am I just a noob for not constantly trying to move in and out of melee-range? Would that even work for non-crippled enemies?
---
I feel like I'm missing something important that this addon would help me achieve if I only knew I ought to do it. Care to explain?
---
stance dancing to use mocking blow as a back-up. Using the taunt he saved for emergencies. using battle shout and trying to hit all 5 people. Demo shout if they're too spread out. Revenge if he has it.
---
Those groups were able to do it on pservers for a SINGLE reason only : account sharing. Pservers do not care what IP an account logs on.
---
In Classic, those guys will clear MC in 2nd ID.
---
Not 1st.
---
This is correct you only need an active sub. No bfa required
---
Did this on P and on Classic past week. On classic layering makes it trivial. On P's It's almost impossible.
---
BIS Head for both is Green Lens (of Frozen Wrath for Mage, of Shadow Wrath for Warlock).
---
The mage neck has a 13% drop rate, the warlock neck has a 7% drop rate.
---
The mage shoulders have a 25% drop rate, you need 8 Felcloth for the warlock shoulders and each drop is 4%.
---
Cape, bracers, gloves, belt, legs, trickets, sword, off-hand are all the same.
---
The drop rate requirements for both crafted robes is roughly equal.
---
Mage boots have a 31% drop rate, warlock boots have a 20% drop rate.
---
Double Freezing Band is just unrealistic for a mage, they share the same BIS if you exclude those.
---
The only place warlocks really win out, is wand. Mages have a 14% drop rate, warlocks have a 33%.
---
Its a server load stress test.
---
Risk of rain 2 is great for 20 dollars on steam, check it out
---
Play it with the your future guildies
---
It should, but only the best players and veterans (some debatable) have actually gotten better at the game.
---
For example, you’ll see plenty of average hunters clipping their autos, warriors not stance dancing effectively (if at all), mages going oom etc etc. if there’s enough of these players then you’ll need a raid with as many “optimal” specs as possible.
---
Also, most players playing sub optimal specs probably won’t go to the lengths of players like esfand to push their spec to the max
---
Just got to 30 in the beta, and [cassicdb.ch](https://cassicdb.ch) is far superior to [classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com).
---
No matter what? Remember when sharding was supposed to only be for the starting zones? And yes, hopefully they'll have free server transfers off of the overpopulated servers.
---
TBC could be tricky. Take a look at the attunements in TBC, it was insane compared to vanilla. IMO they would have to pick a patch were alot of those were removed, even if its gonna piss people off. Or else getting new people for raids is gonna be a nightmare.
---
Dude, for real now, it should be clear for everyone now that shamans’ and paladins’ numbers should be approximately DOUBLED to get their actual percentage for their own factions.  If we’re referring to the same biggest pserver(rhymes with forthbail) horde is around 46% of total population, whereas alliance is 54%. This means that in comparison of for example shamans and rogue, you can just use the formula 0,46 x percentage of rogues. You will see that the percentage is exactly the same as shamans, around 14%. Shaman is there the 3rd most played class, after warriors and mages.
---
Just practice on private servers for fuck sake
---
Yeah that's true. The big problem is when running UBRS though. It might be difficult since you need 10 people and if I'm a rogue and reserving painweaver band for example, the rest of the dps will only be mages &amp; locks basically. That will cause the group taking longer to form since I'm not searching amongst all DPS and some mages &amp; locks might not even wanna tag along because of how many others there are in the group :) But I hear you!
---
The skinning enchant goes to your gloves, not on finkle. And you don't need an enchant to skin the beast (level 62), only finkle.
---
You do need finkle and the enchant to skin Onyxia (level 63).
---
very true, guilds will just want to bring the BEST dps specs if every fight is a dps check
---
Sounds perfect for the casual crowd that everyone likes to shit on for playing retail.
---
Perfect example of someone who just doesn´t want to like classic.
---
There is so many great examples of why TBC sucks in comparison to classic as well.
---
Everyone prefers his own I guess. But no Need to talk down classic really
---
TBC is boring - you can fly everywhere
---
Old Content is basically non-existent because you will be in outland flying around all day
---
All wow Content is grindy really before Cata - I don´t get that Point
---
There will hopefully be a TBC Server in the near future. Get the TBC community and fight for it - like the classic community did
---
It would be a little nod to the nostalgia part of the game and isn't that highly interactive with live to not happen. It's literally the name of a demon. For a person like me or anyone else who still has their warlock from when we started playing it would be cool to see.
---
Why dont they just do this on fridays?
---
I spent 10k on teebu's blazing longsword obviously
---
I know that there will be clusters around them but unless you are streamsniping yourself you are not going to see them a lot if at all.
---
Its not true, he is talking about total percentage, whereas the real number should be doubled, as shamans are horde only. Therefore shamans are around 14%, 3rd most played class after mage and warrior.
---
Yup and xping with pots or buffs really makes stuff easier
---
Was it a white and unusually long cloak?
---
Look at that shit.
---
Palm Deskop for palm pads. MSN Messenger. Limewire. 
---
I'm *there*. I'm back in 2004.
---
well this thread keeps getting downvoted, so idk
---
Great read! I wasn't asking about how to make gold, but just a general thought on how the economy will play out when the servers are fresh from 0.
---
Personally I am going to pick up Herb and Mining (and all the secondary professions, obviously), send all the stuff to an alt. And make those alt(s) have crafting professions.
---
I'm not too worried about gaining gold. I'll be selling stuff on the AH after a few months, and I'll be farming for raid gear, consumables, and overall just getting ready. But most of all, just enjoying the nostalgia train.
---
Being in a guild will mean I'll be needed for dungeon runs I don't personally need, and others will be needed for dungeon runs they don't personally need.  
---
I choose not to see it as my progress but the guild's, because me being raid ready means nothing if a large chunk of the raid isn't.  
---
As such it will be the same for pretty much every class :p
---
Hope you’ll enjoy it as much as we all did back in the day. First time is truly an experience.
---
twas a joke, champ.
---
Denial is just a step friend. You'll be okay. You just have to make it through grief, anger and acceptance.
---
Thank you very much chaps, i appreciate your insight \^\^
---
I havent played a single game since classic announcement. And I dont want to play beta, I want to dive right into classic. Lets just say it will be rough weeks for me, my stream and my gf who has to take up with my bitching that I cannot just sleep through the weeks until classic
---
probably because asmongold is massively hated
---
[3 man Onixia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOKlXklfzzE) was doable in Vanilla.
---
I'm giving myself a break I meal prep most of the time. It won't hurt since I eat like a health fanatic usually. I could use a nice break with a bit of grease LOL
---
Great stuff!
---
Well warriors are always higher and still in demand, as most characters created are warriors, yet most never make it till 60. However 14% shamans is actually very big, and according to biggest private servers, theyre the 3rd most played class for horde.
---
It can be in some ways but if you want to grind out all the rep for unique mounts on every character or get the rare drop mounts on every character it's pretty unfriendly
---
Dual spec.
---
But with a 10g cost to swap between them. That way you can have one pvp/farming spec and one raid spec. But if you want to change them you still need to pay normal respec. Wouldn't want to remove a big gold sink.
---
Does it keep counting even if hitting a pw:shield for example?
---
Thats the thing people are bad and still one hit the content. I never played much of vanilla private servers cuz its too much time to have everything ereased in a few months but i've leveled to like 30 on one and elites and dungeons on there hit way harder. Its still easy AF and we one shot dungeons with no wipes with randoms but at least there was SOME challenge but classic is like generally 2x easier and at times even more than that. If people in 2019 on privates are stuck in BWL then on classic those same people are gonna breeze thru everything including AQ and gonna enter naxx where it will be the only challenge but it will take just a while longer. Its too ez.
---
Yepp, that's how it will be. Hopefully you can get an AV or two that'll be some "real" action and big fights. 
---
Otherwise it should be quite easy to arrange Tarren Mill vs Southshore fights on every server =)
---
Big fan of instant Ramen here.  
---
It's not unhealthy and tastes pretty well actually if you follow these simpe guidelines:
---
* Buy imports from an asian food store, not the crap offered in western supermarkets
---
* Combine with freshly cut spring onions and red paprika BEFORE pouring the water
---
* Add more water than just to cover the noodles, Ramen is a soup, not a pasta
---
* Fry up some mushrooms, onions and either tofu|zucchini|tunafish|pig|saitan|chicken with butter, and add it just before serving
---
Enjoy with some green tea, or black if you need the caffeeine =)

(You don't have to buy anything. You only need to subscribe.)
---
Yes, but on a private test, where we were only 70 max at a time, could speak between Horde/Alliance, and had plenty of bugs. That was a strange time. Real "retail" character was on BC, then got max only in wotlk. So I don't know where I  stand here x)
---
dont tell me how to live my life
---
Can you point me towards vod highlights?
---
I only know the guy that does the wow arena videos and now he does classic and is nailing those
---
Same. I've seen Asmongold "betting" with his chat that he won't wipe in the deadmines.
---
But I remember the deadmines not being hard. The only thing we really struggled with, was patrols ambushing us in the back and Captain Greenskin. And I didn't know shit about the game, I wasn't optimally dealing damage at all.
---
But I also remember scholomance handing my ass to me.
---
Kiting enemies as a warrior with hamstring and moving in when your auto is ready is one of the most efficient ways to level as one. Really lowers how much damage you take. But in general auto is a big portion of dps in classic and people like to know when thats going to happen.
---
brehs... how could we be wrong? we played retail for over 10 years... how could we be wrong... no no no.... NO!!!!!!!!!!
---
The hardest thing about MC and BWL is getting 40 people to listen and do their jobs. I’d take a kitty over a rogue of the kitty was a better player. 
---
Just play what you want to play and enjoy the game
---
Not sure why you were voted down. I upvoted to keep you even. Honestly what a lot of players don’t seem to realize is a lot of the “built in” functions that are UI related started as an Add-On that became popular. Most of the non-in game talent specialization response will be “An add-on can do that.”
---
the shaman epic quest.
---
hmmm actually looking it over, there's actually two versions of the quest.
---
one was added in 1.4 and would be in phase 2 (awarding a blue elemental/resto helm), but it was completely replaced with a different version in 1.7 that gives a completely different reward (an epic Enhancement helm) that you could trade in the old one for if you already did the previous quest.
---
Speak for yourself matie
---
Go horde. Both priest races are good in pve and pvp equally without feeling the need to min max or try hard.
---
Not gathering professions. Not sure why OP got downvoted since you can level mining to 300 on the beta.
---
I didn’t even think to do this. You’re a champ, thanks!
---
Hope you are ready to do it all over again!
---
[Here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxS--K1au6M) is another. 24 minutes real-time. Same guild. This happened after I left in a run that I wasn't in, and as such I cannot comment on the gear or preperation. For what it's worth, Wipe Club cleared Naxx, and was definitely a hardcore, top-end guild.
---
Wow that's really vanilla like - Alliance is still absolute trash at pvp
---
Just play what you want, it’s a game after all
---
Yeah, good luck with that for them, but good luck with the rolls for loot competing with the 7 other shamans :D I only see it as a bad thing that the raid is filled with the same class as you are
---
3k is a ded server btw. No idea what they're going to do with streamer servers though.
---
This is the strangest dumbest thing I’m gonna read all day and I just woke up
---
Just off the top of my head say you are playing a warrior, you want to maximize your dps around your swings. To do that you need to be cognizant about which abilities will reset your swing timer. 
---
You'll lose dps if you cancel an auto with an ability and its just about to go off.
---
Yeah, but they don't want to push open that door even a little, and with good reason.
---
First it's your request, which I agree is harmless. Next is Naming dibs. Next is Mounts. Next is PvP Rank. And before you know it, we have people demanding to chartransfer their legacy character over to Classic, Gold and items intact.
---
Wehret den Anfängen.
---
battle shout doesn't give threat like that on classic beta.  mocking blow is a good spell but that's kind of a common sense thing i'd think and it can miss or get parried just like taunt.  demo shout is something you're just supposed to be doing anyway and doesn't affect whether sunder armor got missed.  You're kind of just listing the only 4 abilities prot warriors had in vanilla.  Like, yeah, you press your buttons when they light up and refresh buffs and debuffs.  Tools to actually deal with stuff  reactively would be things like shockwave, short CD defensives, calling for externals, stuff that didn't exist back then.
---
Back in the days there were barely any dwarf priest because they thought like you and they didnt know about fear ward. And somehow they managed to kill bosses anyway.
---
Awesome. Seems like you know what real Ramen is supposed to be. I'm freaking starving now that sounds delicious. I go to a really good ramen spot here in Michigan called Matsu Chan
---
No problem! If you check some of the earlier areas and bosses like Deadmines, they aren't totally incomplete now. Datamining vs info from the client is a bit obscure/unintuitive so I don't mind explaining it. Personally I think it's kind of neat watching the site evolve from scratch and take shape but I see how it causes some confusion if say, items have been up for months, but then NPCs require a bunch of fancy additional info to also be polished :)
---
I would pay literally good for this collection. Not every book can be found here in Turkey
---
your bf(black friend) is a clever one, this game is iconic
---
&gt;and also not the modern fad genre.
---
Reading is hard.
---
Yeah but part of those guides is "don't bring crap specs".
---
You're right that some players may be fine with just doing tier 1 and never going past that, but if that's the bar it needs to be stated, I think.
---
Most people advocating playing whatever spec sure make it sound like it's perfectly fine for killing KT ("you just won't speedclear it" or whatever).
---
At the end of the day most people telling others not to play ele, ret, balance, etc, on Reddit are doing it to be kind. If people end up rolling a moonkin, anyone who cares just won't group with them. It's not like it really benefits the first party that another player doesn't play a spec that doesn't perform.
---
I'm mostly just against painting a false picture for people. Telling someone he can play moonkin at virtually no real disadvantage, and anyone who gives them shit is just an elitist jerk, will just make these players disappointed after they put serious time into their character only to realize, hey, maybe these people weren't just dicks when they told me to not play this.
---
The clock on the minimap
---
I am, thankfully it won't take such a time commitment this time around :)
---
I guess you could be right. However private servers give pretty much same numbers of shaman being top 3 class. The numbers there are of course composed of a certaing group as well.
---
lol i gave you the best possible evidence and you still think something is wrong :D you must also believe earth is flat eh ?
---
That's a great way to view this "issue". Hope to find a guild with people with the same mentality as you!
---
I still don't understand why people care so much about this. Just choose a realm with your friends (Or just pick a realm to make friends), and go with that. I have a "I don't really give a shit what they do" stance. Let them play how they want to play.
---
You like PvP, pick a PvP realm. If it has a popular streamer on it and their audience follows, cool! More idiots to gank/kill/farm HK.
---
You like PvE, pick a PvE realm. If it has a popular streamer on it and their audience follows, cool! You wont really interact with their shenanigans (unless you choose to). You'll be too busy questing, looking for groups, and hanging out with your guild mates to really notice.
---
Do you notice the streamer influence on your server in retail? I'd bet no. and if you do, its because you're looking for it.
---
Nah, Total war three kingdoms is so good it takes the edge off waiting till the end of summer (Pretty much)
---
Play what you want, and forget the PServer Kiddies telling everyone that only minmaxed out characters will ever be invited to raids.
---
It's a lie.
---
horde? what do you think I am, a traitor?!  
---
shame
---
Play whatever race you want. Fear ward is nice to have, but not necessary. There will be enough dwarf priests anyway ... as for the tiger mount, just farm reputation :D
---
Also the 1.10 patch (healing revamp) was a massive upgrade.
---
Before that your heals/greater heals had a base cast time of 4s which certainly was impractical and lead to a lot of flash heal/lesser healing wave spam and oom-ness. The 1.10 patch reduced healing mana costs by 9% across the board, AND made mana efficient spells usable. Back then pre-casting and cancelling heals was an advanced technique, and only a select few did get the memo about downranking.
---
Teaching everyone to watch healer mana, teaching about aggro, threat and the 5 seconds rule, having accross the board 100ms ping and considerable spikes, all of these things made early instances more difficult than they were. 
---
It wasn't exactly mob damage, rather the inevitability that someone would end up dying due to not listening, or watching, or due to a mishandled lag spike.
---
Way back then with even a remotely competent party, Heal Rank 2 trivialized it due to the low enemy damage. I don't expect Dire Maul to be any harder by today's standards.
---
https://willitclassic.com/ is okay, not great, but the best we have.
---
OMG same
---
THANK YOU!! i dont hate asmon but damn im sick of seeing his face all the bloody time...
---
How come? All private servers have alliance outnumbering horde easily, almost making it problematic sometimes.
---
I didn’t play vanilla. I opened a ticket to know the exact date I created my wow account and the gm after requesting some info gave me this.
---
Account creation: 14 March 2007 13:01:33pm
---
First login: 14 March 2007 13:03:45
---
First death: 14 March 2007 15:02:05
---
Haha I liked the last one
---
&gt;  would still be "dying" slowly each year **from just being old as fuck and also** not the modern fad genre. 
---
Cherry picking is easy.
---
Just play what you want mate enjoy the game remember don’t make a toon you don’t like the look of you, will be spending 50+ days played looking at that thing if you raid though aq40.
---
There's no such thing as purely random in electronic computers. *All* non-quantum computers are finite state deterministic automatons. 
---
Is that helpful? Only if the seed for pet names were based on something that can be easily replicated such as character, account, and server name. 
---
In the more likely case it simply used a /roll seeded by the number of seconds between January 1 1970 and the last server restart before the first time you summoned your pet, then it would indeed be impossible without interacting with live servers.
---
Tbc Attunements are all pretty easy, and chances are anyone with the required gear for t5 / t6 would already have the attunement done anyways.
---
Ohh I was on sargeras too as a rogue called knob. Got to 60 around Dec then sold my account. Picked it back up 6 months later.
---
Just nitpicking, but it does say 37minutes
---
Im probably going to try and gather people do put up a hard defense and create "turtle" matches.
---
Those are way more fun than just rushing and killing pve monsters.
---
Relax buddy. Everything is going to be okay. I'm just as passionate as you are about this. Please lighten up :)
---
Halo zero?
---
Thank you for that dude, i didn't understand it clearly enough, i thought you needed to have WoW in order to subscribe to WoW if you know what i mean :)
---
Well that latter part does make sense then
---
Size doesn't matter! :p
---
Blink and frost nova, gotta play hard if u want to improve
---
You’re enjoying it. That’s what you’re doing!
---
This is correct and has been confirmed by blue post.
---
I had read up a little before playing the game, so I knew about managing threat and was therefore able to keep aggro on me.
---
But I initially tanked with a two-handed weapon. My philosophy was the mobs would do less damage if they died faster. Which was true, but it got a little hairy for my healers at times.
---
Can Blizzard give their stance on addons already?
---
If they are going to allow things such as castbar/questhelper/DBM/atlas-loot etc they should just implement it into the client tbh so like they have on retail
---
Dual Spec for sure. Amazing for both hybrid classes but also for pure DPS for PvE / PvP specs
---
It added actual skill to be required instead of who can poly /sap who first and destroy the enemy in less than 4 seconds....
---
"just farm reputation" he says xD
---
I remember the grind... it's so horrid
---
I dunno man, He said TBC a lot. I think he likes it.
---
Jesus fuck no one cares. For legitimate arguments, it's random.
---
I know right, the hell with dwarves
---
Either they are secretly working on TBC now or you are YEARS away from this happening.
---
Girth does :D
---
Sure,  I was thinking about the leveling but if you have end-game in mind it's indeed not an alt-friendly game
---
:) I hope you reconsider choosing what class to play based on factors other than pre-raid bis farming though. It's a super small period of time, maybe a couple of weeks or a month depending, it's a special time in the cycle but it will be over before you know it.
---
Yes you're right. Although if I planned on playing lock. I would not go for green lens since it's RNG which "of blabla" you'll get and I can't be arsed with that. Felcloth hood is a definitely a good enough replacement.
---
I wasn't planning on getting robe of the void either but since robe of winter night is viable for mages aswell they would be the same.
---
But it seems like it edges out as pretty even so then I would have to add mage to the list of classes I might play :P
---
\[You would love the military\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO0B-cjDozM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO0B-cjDozM))
---
Healthy Population, better latency (u.s.) less bugs and no item store.
---
&gt; Do you take billy the retarded daggers rogue who raids in PvP spec and dies to fire or do you take the best ret paladin on your server?
---
That's not a good question to ask because you make the answer obvious.
---
Do you take Billy the daggers rogue who can listen to a few pointers and do twice the damage of a ret or do you take a ret who needs full elixirs and buffs to get the same damage as Billy who dies in the fire at the halfway point of the boss fight?
---
Above 1k8 it's only about having the best drood running around a pole.
---
Full of war/drood :(
---
There is something not right about this math
---
Is Blizzard Sauron, and WoW the one mmo to rule them all?
---
Blizzard have changed how you play WoW for a while.
---
There is no "base game" to buy any more. You create a (free) account and can play to level 20. If you subscribe you can play to level 110 (currently). You only need to buy the latest expansion (BfA currently).
---
Classic will be included in the subscription.
---
 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReZeaPM6oKVvdBB3v1kFQUZdAHeBs3-Ri4stOd8zM-U/edit#gid=1942601337](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReZeaPM6oKVvdBB3v1kFQUZdAHeBs3-Ri4stOd8zM-U/edit#gid=1942601337)  this one is pretty good. You can choose different patch based what content is on game.
---
you can do it without any grind while leveling just use a guide to do all the quests at the right levels
---
Someone asked me in 2005 why I made my Mage bald. I said that he'd burned his hair and head so often that he now just shaved it. 
---
He was a cool Mage.
---
You can already do that. For a "small" fee. :-)
---
The amount of mental gymnastics in this subbreddit of people trying to justify their lack of wanting to play the beta is mind boggling.
---
I just imagine Donald trump saying “wrong” 😂
---
I would argue it in a small indirectly way is, as he attracts a number of people who act correspondingly to those thumbnails.
---
Asking the cold, hard, real questions.
---
Dont think so?
---
Sounds like something actually useful after all. I considered it to be pure eycandy stuff. 
---
Which is fine!
---
I love how on a p-server, the hunter-autoshot-bar speeds up when haste procs! Makes the proc feel even better by giving visual feedback. I'd have been be totally fine with it if everyone had chimed in and said "just for the optics, just like floating combat text." In fact, I'd be tempted to use it just for that. But weaving in and out of range is something I must try to train on my next melee class. Thanks.
---
Remember one simple fact: Horde cam clear all raids and world bosses. 
---
Fear ward is a nice to have in certain fights. Nothing more. Any other race's racial is *also* a nice to have in certain fights.
---
Outstanding information! Again, thank you very much. Thats going to make the sell to my friends to buy it very easy! &lt;3
---
Well it is, as horde isnt exactly 50% of population but less, around 46%, at least on this private server I’m talking about. So 0,46 x other classes, gives a number of each class to compare with shamans.
---
Yup
---
No.. they want normal server caps. They could probably have 10k+ servers if they wanted.
---
Very interesting, I'd love for you to make a post explaining in depth!
---
Just play the race you want. It's not worth it to stare at a character you like for hundreds of hours of gameplay just for the racials.
---
and people need to realise that playing hybrids as hybrids actually works great.  Palas should not be played as warriors, they should be like steady terminators that outlast their opponents.  Druids should be shifting forms for charges/stuns, stealth openers, dots and hots all the time.  Palas, druids and shamans with smaller mana pools just suck... sure you might get that SoC proc that does a lot of damage now and then but 90% of the time you're going to be needing mana for cleanses, BoF, HoJ and judgements and if you can't fight more than 1 mob/person then you're kinda useless
---
No hate, but there are a dozen channels that simply upload parts of his vods as 'content' and any Classic search result gets extremely cluttered.
---
I’d rather avoid the “plz link achievement for group invite” people. Again, goes against Classic if you ask me.
---
Cloud game account sharing then. I know they have a line in their ToS about it, but I know a lot of people are using shadow + blizzard games with no problems for over a year now.
---
It's then the same machine, same IP range. No way to know who is connecting to the box.
---
Yeah thought about doing that too, but I've decided i prefer questing on the human side ( so much nostalgia, fun, and know all the quests by heart ) and I will actually try to grind the Darnassus rep afterwards...
---
Yes I do consider other factors of course but for me, both in vanilla and on unofficial servers, farming pre-raid BiS was by far the most frustrating part of the game :) And there's no class specifically that stands out for me a lot. I'm tossing between hunter, rouge and warlock basically and I like them all so I'm fine with letting this part guide my decision.
---
You don't have to take the professions, they just help. It's also perfectly viable to buy some off the AH when your gold is stable (which speeds up your levelling/gold accumulation)
---
I am just planting the seeds, and a potential TBC release is a long way off.
---
But I know these rose-tinted TBC fans will try their best to ruin the game, and so we should start early with the anti-TBC posts.
---
Oh man, I haven't seen this in a while!
---
Eh it would not be nice if you had some moral integrity and pride 2, but I guess that’s old fashioned thinking in today’s twitch culture.
---
Just make the Warlock first then make the Ele Sham as your alt.
---
Same my fav expansion was WOTLK. To me everything was perfect.
---
Every class can get high rated in 2v2 , etc.  but I was thinking it brings more balance to bg’s
---
I've done it several times, they are very good at the 19 bracket and have a lot less counters. Most classes don't have a spell lock yet, if you're horde you don't even have to worry about earth shock or having shields purged. I would suggest twinking with a dps friend but i disagree that it's useless to solo que as a twink healer. You can still destroy any non-twinks considering they'll have like 400-700 hp while you should have over 1k. If you're a horde priest you can instant cast power word shields on every person near you and they block like 200 damage each.
---
Also if you go resto druid you can take full advantage of the furlbog medicine pouch since you'll be flag carrying more and the health is the most useful there.
---
Just started a sunken city game with some friends, fun af; would recommend. Scratches that wow itch a bit too.
---
“It’s just an act bro, chill, you have to understand the subtle nuances of the behavior to fully appreciate it.” /s 
---
That’s what all the douches say to safeguard their own behavior
---
Because they'd all try to solo him underleveled
---
Lol I'm not comparing WASD to ESDF, I'm comparing WASD/ESDF (which both have the same benefits) to an analogue stick. 
---
Yes, if WASD is better than an analogue stick then ESDF is even better. That's not what the discussion is though. Please read before you comment.

For me was like a ritual. I didn’t do it every day but when I was back home I used to prepared a tortilla de patatas (Spanish omelette, I’m Spanish), then go to the gym. Back home it was leveling having some slices of tortilla with classic coke. 
---
For pvp and dungeons chocolate biscuits and grave&amp;peach juice was the choice.
---
For LAN parties at friends place it was 80% time pizza and classic coke. The hard part was the music as I usually listen Pink Floyd in rainy areas, Dire Straits for desert ones and Iron Maiden for pvp and my friends use to like just pop from radio (very random)
---
Dwarves can use mechano striders which are pretty cool. Can’t see why you wouldn’t go with a hard small boi.
---
I definitely would not choose a class based on which is easiest to pre-BIS. That gear gets replaced fast and you don't even need it to succeed in MC and Ony.
---
I don t remember SFK as a difficult dungeon, and I played in vanilla.
---
I honestly raided in vanilla naxx 4/15. lot of ppl just forward information and actually never played by themselves. There are bot many ppl who actually have been in naxx comparing it to the overall playerbase. 
---
Surely i wasn‘t a pro either back then as it was my first mmo i played, but i informed myself on several forums already back in the time regarding my class cause that actually is part of the game to be and also brings me fun.
---
Theres only one viable option for me. You know that female dwarven hairstyle that's two big chunky braids? Do you know what happens when a dwarven woman casts with that hairstyle? They FLY. This is, the my knowledge, the ONLY animated hair in the game, and therefore tier one.
---
Thank you, that's great
---
resto shamans are great, ele shamans are shit for everything but lvling
---
&gt;There's no such thing as purely random in electronic computers.
---
This isn't true. There is.
---
The `/dev/urandom` virtual device in UNIX based operating systems coughs up actually random numbers, by [tapping into environmental noise](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/char/random.c?id=refs/tags/v3.15.6#n52) generated by device drivers and similar sources.
---
The `/dev/random` device does the same, in an even stricter fashion (constantly refreshing the entropy pool and blocking if there is insufficient entropy at time of access.
---
NT based systems (Windows) have a similar device, exposed via the win32 API, called [BCryptGenRandom](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/bcrypt/nf-bcrypt-bcryptgenrandom)
---
Roll a Dwarf Priest and guild masters will beg you to join their guild. Roll a non-Dwarf Priest and deal with everyone asking you why you didn’t roll a Dwarf Priest.
---
For me it has less to do with staring at man-butt all day, and more to do with casting animations. Female nelf over male is the easiest decision of my classic character creation.
---
They’re not ‘his’. They’re videos people post of his streams to make a quick buck. I know asmon isn’t likeable by everyone but the amount of asmon bashing here is more annoying than anything, thumbnails included.
---
This one always makes me laugh
---
When is starshards nice to have lmao
---
Can you provide some other way of math and calculating actual number for shamans popularity, or are you just going to downvote me?
---
Great addon man. Loved the previous version but this seems SO much better. Will try it tomorrow on stress test :D
---
How about the respawn times in instances? Cant be right right?
---
my tip:  don't rush.  The leveling journey is fantastic and there are a lot of interesting quest lines and stories to see.
---
a lot of us will be power-leveling to end game but thats cos we've leveled a bunch of times... the first time i did 1-60 i think it took me like 5 months or something and i loved it
---
Why do I see a 30 min Youtube Tutorial on how to do it coming very soon xD
---
Why would he? It helps his stream lol. YouTube is why I know who asmon is.
---
It sucks if it's a mob that isn't good for grinding, though.
---
You do know that basically every mythic guild in the top10 all account share right?
---
Actually been doing some world pvp in retail on my undergeared pally. Feels pretty satisfying poping all my cooldowns on 400 + ilvl horde players while sitting at 300 and still beating them.
---
Not even hydraxian waterlords exalted. What a pleb ;o
---
On some points TBC is the evolved version of Vanilla
---
But during the last patches it where all started with a bunch of nerf of elites/leveling etc... to accomodate casual and solo players (on a MMORPG lol).
---
question I suppose ... It's actually really mana effecient
---
1 thing not mentioned in this thread is if you make an alt after everyone has hit 60 on a high pop PvP server you will occasionally get rolled in places like Stranglethorn Vale or Hillsbrad by people not even close to your level.
---
Thiss, i pretend to go enchanting/mining then drop mining for eng after affording the mounts and having mats to lvl eng 1-300
---
If you wanna play casual tank i‘d recommend druid over a warrior. You level faster, gearing is easier, and you build way more tps in early stages of the game!
---
Elemental Shaman is dead for raiding but good for pvp.
---
As long as the meme specs know how to heal when needed or tank when needed then bring them. Recount will let you know if you're wiping because their DPS is too low and you can make your calls based on that.
---
Doesnt seem great for the longterm population to make people hate the game, but ok
---
Well spoken. This really should be looked at, as we will attempt to see a lot of the “meme” specs I’ve seen and a lot of players will fall flat. I’ve played feral Druid on Private servers and very happy that I’ve been able to distinguish myself with it. I don’t want dual specs in the game.
---
Hope you're right :p
---
There is a scroll vendor? Where is he. What's his name?
---
I need this info! &lt;3
---
They're great in PVP
---
Max out your reps as much as possible now 😀
---
I don't know the exact details for myself but I'm betting I didn't last that long! Interesting to see they have this level of details though.
---
A sub-par specced healer is still better than a sub-par specced DPS.

Do that if it helps you overcome your lack of arguments. The reasons why these statements are wrong have been discussed to pieces 1000 times over on this /r, I see no need for mindless repetition.

A friend of mine made a lvl 1 twink rogue, fiery weapon was the hard carry when beating level 10s.

Yeah that caught my eye as well when I logged in. 20649/21000
---
We stopped doing Molten Core entirely at some point, and since I started only in September 2005 after military service, I missed some of the early MC days.
---
Yes, cherry picking is literally what you just did and I called you out on it by quoting the rest of the sentence. I am being trolled right now, right? Am I in LSF or ClassicWoW? 
---
The "and also" implies you need to finish the sentence and include the entire context. The base assertion is that regardless of how good or bad it is, those two things would make it still fall over time because less people are interested in that genre these days. Not one, or the other, but both. No one has innovated mmorpgs in a decade, shooters just hit with the BR genre a couple years ago and are still coming in hot and that is what the kids want.
---
I also wasn't calling the GENRE of MMORPGs old, I was calling WOW as a GAME old. The oldest FPS still being played with decent numbers is TF2 from 2007, which is impressive, but has nowhere near the numbers of WoW. You have basically made no sense this entire time and I feel like you are just trying to argue for the sake of it rather than make a point.
---
Unfortunately the above is true... especially for progression raiding classes are all white limited as to what they will do. Once you're not progression raiding you can diversify... e.g. druids, shamans, paladins and priests roll with healer/utility... not as dps or tanks.
---
You are doing a thing that you really enjoy and want to share that enjoyment with others.
---
you think zhevra hooves were bad?  oh my sweet horde child.  Murloc eyes....
---
at least zhevras didnt use a healing pot, frost nova you, then run to pull 8 of their mates
---
Yea that’s kind of the thing about suboptimal specs, you can bring a few of them to any content in the game and still clear, but people are going to be pissed if they hit a wall in progression and there’s 3 ret paladins doing 0 dps. also some people just don’t like the idea of carrying those specs, unless the person is putting in max effort all the time it can piss people off that they’re having to work even harder to carry some snowflake that insists on playing a shitty spec, then there’s also the issue of loot that’s an even bigger one but doesn’t need explaining.
---
Damn it, I'd like to recover mine as well but I don't remember a thing. Only got cd's with keys. You think that's enough?
---
0.065% of players completed Naxx.
---
1% killed any raid boss at all.
---
Yeah, most people here are full of shit.
---
Thank you. That is much better.
---
Yeah there isn't many ways to display skill in vanilla PvE
---
CANT C
---
Lol, retail players hate this twat too don't worry.
---
I am not making such claim, my post is just a response to people who think elites in classic are too weak compared to vanilla.   
---
There really are tons of people who think elites hit for 2x less than they should. I do, however, think that the numbers are too low to have a proper challenge and its too easy. I've only played a up until like level 30 on a vanilla private server and some elite dungeon mobs hit for 2x the amount i saw on classic streams but we still cleared the dungeons with no wipes with a random team but at least there was some challenge.   
---
My humble opinion is that after the first 2 year( or whatever it is) server cycle is done they should make some "classic+" realms with higher difficulty.
---
Our guild would have been fucked if the BT/MH attunements hadnt been removed. Many guilds struggled with vashj and KT and getting a new guy thats not MH/BT attuned means your guild have to go back and kill those last bosses again. Same with killing magtheridon for no reason help a guy out to get into TK
---
&gt;I find it quite hard to believe and it seems like a lot of knowledge is just being parroted.
---
Show me a single online platform where this is not true :D
---
Try Diablo 3, I am putting my time between a new character I made on D3 and grinding old reps and instances for mounts. Been thinking of trying EQ Progression Server out as there is a server still on the 1st Expansion, and I never gave EQ1 a go other than maybe a 7-day free trial so I feel like i may have missed out.
---
Please, no. Dual specs to me is against the philosophy of Classic. You wouldn’t see the creativity, you’d just see the normal cookie cutter over and over. Not a fan of arena’s for the simple fact of its not really a social experience. It’s just within your own bubble. But then again, I might be in the minority.
---
I don't know tbh. What I wrote to support was my old account name and pretty intricate details about the characters and gear on those characters. Customer service person was able to locate my account in few minutes and linked it to my current account.
---
Daym, shield drop on first kill =D  Can't wait to do this shit again.
---
To be pedantic, that's still only pseudorandom. If you had perfect knowledge of the environment and how it changes, you could perfectly predict the generated value. Of course, for all intents and purposes, it's as close to random as we will ever realistically need.
---
I love reddit so much, it's ridiculous
---
Not a direct one
---
It should, it is, and people should really stop listening to PServer Kiddies.
---
Reddit misinterpreted my typing.
---
This is great to hear. I've been busy in the beta and missed your original post. Will be happy to install before I do anything else in game.
---
The difficulty in vanilla raiding always lied in the fact that a competent raid leader needed to herd 30+ clueless people through their first raiding encounters, and getting them to understand concepts such as 'threat' or 'waiting for sunders'.
---
Molten Core was a joke, until halfway through where you hit the Fire Res gear roadblock, and even then the difficulty was down to the numbers; can your healers cope with the amount of Fire Res that your raid has? Same thing applied to most of BWL, where it truly got hard at Chromagus, which required the raid to go through the mechanics properly. 
---
And all that was fine, because the 'entry raids' were there to gear newcomers up, up until the release of BC. Proper raiding started in AQ, which was when the various raiding guild needed to 'cut the fat' to be able to progress deeper into the raid.
---
Not only that, but aside from Nefarian, Horde was FIRST to clear all Vanilla raids.
---
he could copystrike those, but he want the exposure so he wont
---
I think this is the only one I would want out of he entirety of the list but you can give them Righteous whatever it was called, the one they got right before TBC. I feel that was just an oversight. Everything else from dual spec, to guild banks, etc. kind of feels like it goes against the spirit. But just an opinion.
---
fuck i love these rate my setup memes so much
---
Ud ftw. WOTF is awesome sauce....
---
They won't. I have been saying this since Classic was announced. There is a simple and logical reason WHY Blizzard will NOT re-release TBC after Classic : MONEY.
---
First, Vanilla pservers and TBC pservers existed in parallel for YEARS, yet, the Vanilla servers were about 5 times more popular than TBC ones.
---
Secondly, OSRS. When OSRS popularity went down, the path chosen by the designers was NEW content...not re-release older Runescape content. And 2 years later, OSRS is 4 times more popular than modern Runescape. We ALL know this, so Blizzard also knows this.
---
Third. Even if re-releasing TBC is CHEAPER, this can be done ONLY after 2 years of Classic. No matter HOW you do it (all Classic servers go automatically to TBC, character copy, or separate TBC servers) the player base will split almost in TWO : Classic players and TBC players.The problem is that Classic players already played for 2 years, and most will quit, instead play TBC. So, a lot of subs will go puff.
---
From a player perspective, that satisfy EVERYONE, Blizzard should do the following, simultaneously, after 2 years of Classic :
---
1. Open new Classic servers
---
2. Open separate TBC servers
---
3. Provide optional character copy from Classic to separate TBC servers
---
4. Automatic TBC upgrade of some Classic servers
---
5. Patch 1.13
---
OBVIOUSLY, this will NEVER HAPPED. So, realistically, Blizzard have only TWO options : Patch 1.13 or TBC+Wrath.
---
I truly believe that Blizzard will either ask players (by implementing some sort of voting system like OSRS) after like 1 year of Classic what do they want, TBC or 1.13, or, Blizzard will provide an optional character copy to TBC servers while implementing 1.13 (so players can choose the way they want), or simply realizing that the popularity of Vanilla servers was much higher than TBC ones and OSRS new content pushed the player base 4 times higher than modern Runescape.
---
I don't think Blizzard is even thinking of splitting the community even further, by proving both 1.13 and TBC, and while TBC is cheaper, and even if it will keep ALL Classic players in...it will only last 2 years. And even assuming that ALL players stay, and they re-release Wrath, that is another 2 years.
---
But the player base (and the subs) will shrink continuously during those 6 years (Classic, TBC and Wrath) and Blizzard will not retain even 20% of the Classic player base at the end of those 6 years.
---
Sure, even 1.13, 1.14 and so on won't be enough to avoid player base shrinking.But it will absolutely retain much more players, AND will add NEW players every single time new content is released.
---
The problem people have with 1.13 is not about TBC vs 1.13...it's about their subjectivity that Blizzard will FUCK IT UP. That is the ONLY thing that have most people opposing 1.13. They KNOW that a good 1.13 IS THE BETTER OPTION...they just don't BELIEVE that Blizzard can deliver it, so they would be rather happy with the crap that was TBC instead.
---
Just imagine this many shit on a game that just launched. Holy fck!!!!
---
Hi, /u/Prixm
---
Oh man, you'll see real Warcraft story unfold! Great games. GREAT games.
---
While you are probably correct, I wasn't saying otherwise. My point was I highly doubt most peoples Vanilla claims.
---
If I remember correctly, the pvp trinket was on a 5 min cd, not 2, and it didn't give you fear immunity for 5 seconds.
---
Well, you could be a Dwarf on a Nightsabre. Not sure if it would good enough for you ...
---
But if yes, just go to Darnassus as level 1 (run - more like corpse run to Menethil and take the boat, or get portaled - unlikely on a fresh server on day 1). I did that on my rogue on Vanilla. And had myself to Darnassus - Exalted by the time I was 40. Do note that this PROBABLY wouldn't work, if you want to push 60 in a week or so. But if not in a rush and running all Night Elf quests, should be doable.
---
PS! I was playing a human rogue, so there was a bit of a rep bonus involved as well.
---
Hillsbrad will have a lot of PVP because Alliance go there for quests at 30 but Horde go there at 22. Since 99% of wPVP is picking on lower level players and Alliance will rarely see same-level Horde while questing here, there'll be a lot of ganking.
---
The other zones have similar quest-levels for both factions so there'll be much less PVP I'm sure since, once people settle down into the grind, getting sucked into half an hour of retaliatory PVP will lose it's appeal.
---
Nah I was definitely a noob. I got to level 20 on a hunter before I even knew hunters could have pets. The highest level character I ever had in Vanilla was 33 or so, and I literally just grinded mobs in Desolace for 3 levels because I didn't know where to find quests.
---
Yea I know about the mana efficiency meme, but you shouldn’t pick racials for being good while leveling, the end goal is always more important. It’s hard to keep motivated and push through the grind if you think you went the wrong race. You just have to decide if aesthetics or power is more important to you, if you’re just going for the mount you should just go human or dwarf then do a nelf leveling route and do cloth turn ins for any leftover rep.
---
This technically isn't stress test 2. this is like 1.5 I would say, they added this after the test that they had previously. I think they will send invites out when its time for actual stress test 2.
---
Well being that you would have to have 2 subs in order to scout is a deterrent. It all depends on how the que system will work.  I doubt blizzard can do anything about premade scouting since it's a paid account and  not just someone making another account on a free server
---
&gt;If you had perfect knowledge of the environment and how it changes, you could perfectly predict the generated value.
---
To be really really pedantic:
---
No, actually you wouldn't, because at the level of electronic interactions in integrated circuits, Quantum effects come into play, which prohibits an accurate prediction of outcome, even if the initial state is completely transparent :-)

Comming from a pserver troglodyte
---
My mage only ever had T2 and its long gone. I think the vendors may have pulled it apart to make T3 for people ran for transmog later on!
---
This is was my original thought and most likely what I'll do, but I wanted other's opinions on the topic.
---
Having an alt is about mount drops?
---
This post gave me so much nostalgia, damn. Can't wait for the classic release, and I gotta find a windows XP skin for windows 10.
---
Full immersion boiiis.
---
Yeah there wasn't even an email. It's just another go at stress test 1 cause the first one was so messed up.
---
Enhancement is not even fun. Literally the only fun part is getting big WF lottery wins, that's about it. Speaking from experience - play literally anything else, you will hate life as enhancement xD
---
&gt;1% killed any raid boss at all.
---
Seriously? That's legit official stats?
---
I dont think there is any benefit other than there is one better fishing rod from a quest on i think hordes side. has +10 fishing as opposed to an alliance  +5 fishing.  Or could be other way around
---
Going prot is pretty useless as a pally at max level. Unfortunately warrior is the viable tank in vanilla. 
---
As for other classes i guess it would depend on what your end game goal is. Raid? Pvp?
---
You forgot to misuse PST like it was the sound you make when trying to get someone's attention quietly.
---
I am right there with you.
---
I'd say about 30-35% of the claims on this subreddit are genuine. A large part is coming from private server experience, and just about half are people who joined late in TBC or WotLK, and are just, as you ay, parroting.
---
Gotta remember those 39 other people are not bots. They don’t want to carry a suboptimal spec doing half the dps they are then lose out on loot to that person who will still be doing half their dps.
---
[Really fast!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfGjLIPRgDA)
---
Yeesh... I wonder if you still run circles around yourself when no one else is talking.
---
&gt; I think you can definitely argue MMORPGs in general are dying though.  Less people want to play them these days and none of them are truly  satisfying. Kids are into shooters for the most part these days and make  up the majority of gaming. Regardless of how good or bad it is, it's an  MMORPG and would still be "dying" slowly each year from just being old  as fuck and also not the modern fad genre. 
---
Nowhere in that final paragraph do you reference WoW except by the word "it's"; you start and end with abstract comparisons between genres because that was your intention. And your comparison was weak.
---
Don't bother sending me another wall of text to save face. I can read just fine.
---
I asked. They just log first one.
---
its been like 15 years and people still cant interrupt.   Those who are shit will be shit
---
the only people who would quit from being camped are retailbabies and streamer kids
---
That's realistically impossible, because you'd have to level up in 5-6 days /played (so essentially you are either account sharing, or not sleeping for a week) when the norm for a fast leveller is around 10 days, and then you'll be going into the raid without any decent pre-raid gear and with ZERO fire resistance and minimal consumables.
---
Good luck with that.
---
You may have the skill to do the mechanics, but the numbers will crush you.
---
Do you *really* think they were talking about deadmines?
---
Sure, and that's a valid take on it. I was just pointing out the logic of the situation rather than the morality.
---
Yes, Blizzard started throwing it around when they announced 25 and 10-man raids in TBC. They wanted raiding to be more accessible.
---
Switch gender
---
Wow very nice, thank you very much.
---
One thing I have been looking for is Classic mechanics, like the auto swing timer, mp5 ticks(which tick every 2 seconds? ) etc stuff like that. is there a guide around that shows this type of stuff
---
On the other side of the spectrum - many of us that played since release are now closing in or past 30 years old.
---
Push come to shove I only have my items/characters/achievements and the odd youtube video to even prove that I played then. I don't have a single screenshot from vanilla-WotLK and barely any from Cataclysm. I'm a player with multiple realm first leveling achievements and high end raiding experience.
---
The important part to take away from that is that I will always treasure the experiences and friends I made, some of which I keep in touch with to this day, even if the media has been lost.
---
Come Classic, I would like to have similar experiences, regardless of what I've done in 2005. And yes, I was also a complete noob until mid-2005, and I'll always remember that. :)
---
&gt;weekly raid schedule
---
Here's your mistake. Raids will be cleared in a day unless you're playing with people who intentionally wipe.
---
couldn't agree more with strangequark18, Asmon is a keyboard turning clicker and he was level 25 in the run and the mage sheeped him and got aggro and still nobody died! xD   
---
Its just too damn easy.
---
I‘d rather take a commited ele shaman who is always online, knows his stuff, farms his consumes, over a retard dps warrior. 
---
Be commited and show knowledge on your class and you will find a spot. Most guilds won‘t minmax the shit out of it. 
---
You just need some luck to find a guild you can play with!
---
So with that luck, Star Citizen this August then?
---
isn't that solely because of heroism?
---
Two words: Arcane Priest.
---
Feral tank?
---
They're literally letting us log on early to get names and servers so if you're home earlier than someone else with the same name they'll get it first which is essentially dibs. They have full control to do whatever they want. Mounts/Classic Characters, Gold and Items intact is a little excessive. Also, they're letting people have their collectors edition pets for Classic on the server.
---
Considering it's proven the law can track you down through your Reddit account, yeah. Unlikely though.
---
People on this subreddit are probably disproportionately represented in those stats though
---
Are the theorycrafting discussions you're having public? I'd love to see what ideas people are coming up with for viable Ret builds in Classic.
---
So my „Pserver Training Session” by leveling a Vanilla Warrior was a waste of time? Mobs hit like bitches and the priv dungeons/raids were overtuned? Well damn, so this opens a lot of options for gear and builds when the Classic rolls out. Perhaps tanking endgame with Prot Pala will be an option after all!
---
I’m off the train again with Wrath. It was fine the first time around. But I still remember everything in Wrath. (I also did everything from Sarah 10m 3D to 0 lights and HLK) I played as much Wrath as Bc and vanilla. But by Wrath I was good. I topped out at huhu and had to quit Bc after t5 (damn school and other teenage preoccupations) I’ve got unfinished business in classic and Bc. 
---
It’s not till wod where I’ve got another raiding gap—and I have no desire to see garrison ever again—so much so I quit the game.
---
And the budget version for me was minor beastslayer.
---
I used to go around in stormwind begging people for silver till I could finally afford someone to make my weapon that. Good times.
---
Everybody who played vanilla before whatever patch they were removed.
---
&gt; A good ret paladin in preraid bis can do upwards of 500 dps with current builds
---
That's all fine and well, but "Hunter weapon" is a meme for a reason. You're going to have to fight for your ret pre-raid BiS tooth and nail. The drama will consume you forever. Every day, multiple times a day, your patience, your empathy and your reputation is going to be tested. Cape of the Black Baron for instance is BiS for like 60% of the playerbase.
---
Nah don't kid yourself, you're going to heal because your healing gear is going to be so much more powerful, so much faster, and with far less drama.
---
Cool. I will probably want to use this.
---
Feral tank beats warr in my opinion. Only a fury prot warr can generate more tps, but takes more dmg. 
---
Playing prot pally without a taunt seems lame to me, also as you go oom, not the best choice.
---
I've started playing pokemon go again cause everytime i load a pc game i think "whats the point classic comes out soon" lol
---
Actually, what people have noticed most in the beta is that aggro ranges are smaller and instances are easier than private servers. However, leveling is generally about 5-10% slower due to stuff like more challenging mob AI and lower quest item drop rates. Still, if someone wants to hit 60 with any sort of speed given a limited play time, they won't be messing around spending ages doing every dungeon or spending 6 hours in world pvp - thats the sort of stuff that leads to 10 days /played times.
---
Haha of course not... of course not;)
---
Sheesh I wanted to play my druid since I started at wotlk and loved balance, not sure I want to invest for no results, we need to know if Blizzard intend to do a specific server for TBC (idk how balance are in this expansion) or it will be the same servers as classic...
---
I feel many people realized that warlocks were underplayed and have big advantages, we will see alot of them
---
Prot isnt totally useless.  Cant you like sort of hold aggro on Naxx trash?  Also fairly viable in dungeons.  Just not really raids
---
No they arent.They are very usefull
---
&gt;Anyone playing vanilla remember the quote 'i rather watch a female character's behind when leveling to 60 instead of male's behind' ?
---
That was always a bullshit excuse, because you don't look at your character when playing. You look at the environment, the enemy positioning, timers, your party's status, etc.
---
Obsolescence of old content is not a prerequisite of "progression", that was Blizzard's choice and, in my opinion, their mistake.  Plenty of games progress vertically whilst keeping the entire game world relevant.  Pre-Abyssea FFXI comes to mind.
---
You can 100% do MC with 20 half way well geared people. When my guild first started into MC we'd only have like 25-28 people, but would say fuck it and go anyway. Would easily make it throigh the first couple of bosses with a bit of difficulty, but downing bosses nonetheless.
---
Ah, I recall being accused of 'stealing all those Soul Shard drops' during my first run of WC. And of course I would Soulstone myself and not the healer. Good times.
---
And it's not just the computational power required. A *lot* of work goes into a few seconds of animation. It would be extremely expensive to create such a game. Would you wait 10 years for an expansion, pay $600 for it and $150 for a month of subscription? :)
---
TBH I’m currently testing warrior on the beta and it’s completely fine to level, maybe you should go watch some videos on how to effectively level a warrior
---
Oh right, I remember most of the char names too and what classes they were because I still got screenshots of them somewhere. And when you say old acc name, you mean that name we had before it all merged into bnet account? I honestly think I remember even that one correctly, it's just that I don't remember which email I used.
---
I’ve been playing female characters for a while now, gonna roll a Human Paladin because I the way they look.
---
&gt; Nowhere in that final paragraph do you reference WoW except by the word "it's"
---
Because WoW is literally the only MMORPG I listed by name in that post and in a paragraph talking about MMORPGS, "it's" is enough context for anyone with a 5th grade or higher reading comprehension to understand. You also claim three small paragraphs are a "wall of text", which means I doubt you read much in general. So "I can read just fine" is probably not as true as you think it is, I'm sorry to break it to you.
---
If you actually have an argument I'll respond again, but if you are just going to keep trying to argue semantics and ignore my entire point, I'm going to consider you a troll and not bother anymore until you say something worth responding to.
---
But no-one has a classic beta key. There are no keys.
---
shhhhh
---
That website were you had to put your gear in and get you're score? BeImba? GetImba? Something like that.
---
To be honest - Dual specc. Would help people take the step to actually roll a tank or a healer. :)
---
This is very true. I was in BFA alpha and beta and was super burned out. Only benefit was I knew a few dungeons very well by the time it released. 
---
Remember everyone in beta right now will have to start over again and will be on equal ground as everyone else on release. And in the back of their minds, they will be thinking (I just did this...).
---
You mean opinions* I don’t argue with idiots
---
Rogue to stealth/ vanish when other faction members come to gank you.
---
Did not exist until TBC
---
So you are saying, that private servers didnt have the rights database and numbers so they tuned it to what they thought it was which may be over tuned. because those numbers where hidden from the public.
---
And then we had the 2018 blizzcon talk, where they said that they could restore the database to 1.12.... 
---
So blizzards numbers where correct, and we have gatekeepers who take private servers as gospel?
---
The end is nigh
---
And chances are that the healer will be a Shadow priest.
---
I mean, that was true in 2005 as well. A friend was regularly heal Dire Maul tribute runs as shadow, because he mostly PvP-ed and screw those respec costs.
---
Can you give me more info? I want to play ret pala where can I read infos?
---
wow :) Hope OP will work the data eventually - maybe there are actually on to something.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Appreciate the insight.
---
None of that 'grind' after mop comes even remotely close to time spent leveling to 60 and regearing. There's simply too many catch up mechanics in retail while you'll get an average of one item every 2 weeks during MC not to mention farming pre bis again.
---
Is vanilla alt friendly? Yes in that way that it's fun to relvl simply because it's a better game.
---
Is the time investment in an Alt gonna be less? Fuck no.
---
Obvi they wouldnt quit immediately, but it plants and feeds a seed of resentment
---
I'll keep an eye out for one.  If you find one, please let me know so I can include it here!
---
Man, that is crazy. Automatic datamining as you play.
---
No no no that was the rumor. It was actually Sylvanas
---
Gotta do the cooking by the book
---
24 level is red target to him (one level higher than orange), which makes it much more playable. Other than that, you are right that he can, however 1/2 and even more power comes from high level enchants and consumables
---

---
Try this, it has all sorts of old goodies.
---
I also genuinely believed that Sonic was in Super Smash Bros Melee for a brief time. I miss those days
---
Recently tried Hogger as a lvl 8 pally on a pserver, dude hits like a truck and you have next to no tools to deal with him, gear sucks etc...
---
...so even though I have a shameful amount of hours logged with wow, to be able to deal with him solo, at the lower lvls, with certain classes wo grinding gear first, its just not feasible solo...
---
Yes, I hated that part too.  The "warcraft" feel died almost instantly as soon as I got to Outland.
---
good, they ruined what wow was and they ruined classic before it's even out
---
So what are you doing here?
---
What I WOULD LOVE TO SEE:
---
1. A sub-optimal but viable way of leveling while doing battlegrounds.
---
2. A sub-optimal but viable experience per hour in dungeons with a good clear speed.
---
Reason for these two: I'd like playing a holy paladin but without dual respeccs, how hard it is to group in classic and how unrewarding dungeons are aside of the few items you can get, I'd like a way for healers and tanks to level up while being in these specs. 
---
What I WOULD HATE TO SEE:
---
1. Dual specialization
---
2. Removing the need of materials to buff / cast skills like blind, AOE buff, etc.
---
3. Daily quests
---
a) Dual spec is bad because it reduces player interactions and character's identity since you can just switch so easily back and forth, and because it makes PVP shittier since PVE players can just dual spec into PVP and crush everyone, where as in if PVE players are forced to have a PVE spec, PVP players can compete with them despite having shittier gear.
---
b) removing the blind powder for blind, or the materials for first aid or AOE buffs would reduce world's interactions, going out of Ironforge to do something and groups. We don't want to see that in classic. Classic is ALL about the community. What makes a MMORPG great is not only the open world with infinite possibilities, it's the COMMUNITY and servers being like a FAMILY. I played classic and I still remember people from my server, 
---
"XXX, the holy dwarf paladin, what an amazing healer! Invite him if you can!"
---
"YYY, the human warrior tank, elude him if you can! I heard he ninjad a big item and then left his guild!"
---
"ZZZ, the undead frost mage, holy fuck, shit shit shit, I was just mining some ore to make some gold and he's approaching me! I am screwed!"
---
People had recognizable identities and servers despite being massively large had known faces and you ended up knowing almost everyone which made classic wow not feel like a game but like an online family.
---
c) Daily quests. Some form of daily quests are OK if they're to reach a goal like reaching exalted reputation with a faction, but if they're "endless" they make the game feel like HOMEWORK and not like a game. MODERN Dailies in MMORPGS are way more efficient than anything else  (If not nobody would do one thing over and over) and make anything else just shitty reducing other areas' playerbase.
---
It’s a combination of bEta for ass a lot and classic. I played a little more than a year of legion and enjoyed myself pvping for elite sets, then tried painfully to hope for BFA to turn at least ok for 3 ish months. The thing that in the end killed it for me, aside from all the stupid trinkets and gear uncertainty, was seeing my friend list. Everyone was quitting. I made so many arena friends in legion, and tried long and hard to find more in BFA, but everyone just kept quitting. Now with classic having a release date my discord is finally active again with those same ppl coming back for it. Some will go bk to retail, most only if it actually gets good again, but I expect most will notZ
---
1. The importance of Dwarf Priests is somewhat overstated. Yes, FW is nice, and makes *some* raid encounters easier. But usually 2-3 Dwarf Priests (of around 8 Priest slots) are sufficient to get all the fearwarding you need. So there's more than enough space for non-Dwarf Priests.
---
2. You can farm rep to get that sweet nightsaber mount (I did it when Vanilla was current, though the rep patch made it significantly easier because it fixed the bug with decaying rep), so, depending on how much your really want to play a night elf, nightsabers should probably not pigeonhole you into playing one.
---
3. You will play that character for a long, long time. Pick something that you *like* playing, because ultimately, you play to have fun. And if every second of that fun is marred by having to play a character you dislike, that's gonna burn you out sooner or later. I am saying that as someone who *tried* playing a Dwarf Priest, and just could not stomach it after a few weeks.
---
4. Humans in particular are a solid pick as Priest as well. Like Dwarves, they get Desperate Prayer, and while their  second racial is forgettable, Human Spirit becomes more valuable as their gear improves (iirc it works off of over-all spirit, not base spirit), which, coupled with Spiritual Guidance, gives them a slight edge in raw throughput, especially with good gear. Plus, they got Diplomacy, which really helps with the rep grinds.
---
Fuck that. The attunements were one of the best parts of Bc. I’d consider not playing is attunements were out. Frankly I don’t even want the 2.x leveling nerf that happened for 1-60. 
---
Attuning yourself for raids and heroics is part of the early endgame. In the same way getting your gear together so you can do mc is in Vanilla. If they do Bc, they will ease the attunements the same patch they did on live, Bc would be released in phases just like classic is going to be. Classic, while it does have attunements, mostly Gates content with gear (stuff just straight up kills you with you the needed gear). They release catch up dungeons to deal with that allowing fresher 60s more avenues for gear allowing them to get into raids quicker. Same with Bc, they will ease attunements when enough post attunement content opens up to justify the loss of the player time investment they are losing by not doing the attunements work. 
---
Attunements of Bc and vanilla are the “rpg elements” retail stripped from the game. If you don’t like them in even their conception...wait for BC timewalking. Myself and a lot of others who want BC want to epic questiness that comes with the BC attunements. 
---
Best content gating mechanism blizzard ever came up with, t4 and 5 in the game from the start.
---
'Grindy too' lemme assure you, nothing is grindy about BFA right now. Having your neck at an appropriate lvl requires little to no effort at all. If you're a bit smart about the catch up mechanic and when to dos turn ins etc atleast.
---
I am like 50 times better than I was in vanilla.
---
Back then I only understood the purpose of shields and taunt when someone explained to me in Dire Maul.
---
Also while you're subscribed, you can play the retail WoW too. Just up to level 110. To get to 120 you need to buy Bfa.
---
One sub, two games.
---
dang grats to him and the 100 other streamers playing
---
This.  Theres 40 spots and up until late Aq40 like 10 of them need to be playing the game.  best part of vanilla for me is the flexibility in bringing non meta classes and fun (albeit shit) players.
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
---
Is this on EU? CoX was my old guild through BC And WOTLK
---
They fixed it? When I played it was a chore. Felt like I was working a job.
---
I of course meant the horde variation bloodlust, because I gave it as a reason to why horde was better at raiding, my bad
---
that's nice dear
---
Or all the rogues overlap their kicks xD
---
this used to be my backround, idk how old it is tho.
---
I had exact 45 minutes. And it was so accurate too! Could go afk and come back after 40 minutes and get the invite just on time. Used to do logg in, q, and do homework for 40 minutes
---
The thing is, most everyone started out as a noob. Except for the people coming from other MMORPGs. However as I understand it, WoW was the entry into MMOs for a lot of the players. What became of these people, is kind of dependent on their experience and personality.
---
If you just liked to play the game at a slow pace, exploring, doing odd quests - it is quite likely that you didn't need to 'grow' out of it. Or more likely you didn't need to grow past the casual level. However if you were more driven, wanting to compete in PvP/raids, you probably got on the forums. Started reading guides for your class and content. Thus making the transition from noob -&gt; casual -&gt; ... -&gt; pro/addict :P Replace the ... with whatever tiers you feel are appropriate. I'm not going to define them, as not to derail from the topic at hand.
---
Also I believe that the more vocal part of the Classic community might have actually been the raiders/hardcore pvpers of Vanilla. Mainly due to them being more outspoken about their 'glory days'.
---
So to sum it up. I totally started out as a n00b. However I did a lot of research and put in a ton of hours (probably more than I should have). And in the end was part of the raider community. Pushing far into AQ40 and also clearing part of Naxx (didn't clear). I believe there are plenty like me (several of my friends and once guildies for sure).
---
PS! Not saying that people won't scale up their achievements on the boards though!
---
Hey, thanks for the resources! I was planning on getting into some addon work once i get beta access (or live eventually hits). 
---
I have a general question and maybe someone here can give some input. There are no plans for a HTTP API on blizzards' side, at least as far as I know. Neither Classic nor retail/BFA. Some time ago I worked on a project for another game that had the same limitation. TL DR extract and provide character information via a web service. Maybe add some cool features (guild inventory management) for flavor.
---
Are there such projects in motion and/or is there general interest for this? 
---
My hands itch to try something and until August I could only work on the backend/client side, then add the addon once live hits. Poke me if you are interested in such a project ;)
---
God forbid you have to do team things in a team game.
---
solid reply thanks!  
---
And , your post has been my thought process, hence I'm probably picking human and will farm the red for the nightsaber.
---
Size isnt everything, I have a 500mbit connection in the Mediterranean sea but would swap it for my old 100mbit line in Sweden any day of the week.
---
It wasn't just age, it was something completely new for most of the playerbase. It was one of the first RPGs I really got into and I didn't even under stand the trinity system until I was near level cap.
---
Bc before dailies got added everywhere was the game it it’s peak.
---
FAKE!
---
How? You need waterlord Rep and the associated chain to even summon him. Which involves killing shit inside MC.
---
I know it's impossible to have the same sense of mystery and wonder that I had when I first started but it'll be good to try and have a similar experience. I'm not into min/maxing (although for those that are, it's your sub play as you want) and I'd like to enjoy the journey and not worry about rushing, optimum levelling routes and getting bis gear. I hope there'll be more who'll play this way.
---
That's awesome and thanks for the post!
---
people haven't played vanilla PvE ret or enhancement correctly in over 15 years, though a few people did eventually start figuring it out in the last few years.
---
Those were ENTIRE SPECS. With 6 out of 8 PvE sets supporting them instead of healing. And people couldn't figure it out.
---
How many small things do you think the average player completely overlooks or even thinks about that are making the content much harder than it needs to be?
---
there are encounters that seem completely broken and impossible without a group that once you figure out the trick to it are a joke.
---
Sometimes just a good understanding the mechanics is all it takes to make a few small adjustments and go from impossible to doable.
---
The goofy-ass faces he makes is part of his comedy, imo. I don't see a problem with him and/or Catdanny plastering his dumb face on all the thumbnails. While it may annoy you when you are looking for a non-Asmongold only video, it's very helpful to people who just type some shit like "classic wow dragon in city" or some shit and can see his face, it makes it easier for them to find him.
---
Afaik, he doesn't throw up dildos on his thumbnails and say "I GOT COMPLETELY FUCKED BY AN ORC!" or anything like Buzzfeed or clickbait videos generally would, so I don't see a problem with it.
---
&gt; goofy ass-faces

What people are remembering is running dungeons at 1.1 to\~1.6. There where a lot of incremental Undocumented changes. 1.12 Dungeons are basically LFR.
---
Hi, /u/Sendoku72k
---
&gt; Remember one simple fact: Horde can clear all raids and world bosses. 
---
Well, they do have Tremor Totems, which are *marginally* more useful at nullifying Fear effects.
---
Plus the fact that summoning Domo means having enough people with Quints to dose the runes, which means needing that many people with the Waterlord chain done, that requires having killed shit inside MC.
---
Well, that escalated quickly. Bye, I won't be hearing from you ever again.
---
not since blizz cracked down on it in legion.
---
&gt;We will 100% see tons of people showing up at the recommended levels undergeared and take a beating
---
Asmongold also did Scarlet Cathedral at level 30 without a single wipe. You can't say he was overgeared or over-leveled compared to what the average joe will be.
---
Content release isn't part of a Frankenpatch. It's a content release to gate progression. Itemization again is static, just like all forms of content being released. Mounts can be considered a Frankenpatch but afaik that's the only change from 1.12
---
Frankenpatch would be class A is 1.6, class B is 1.11, debuff limit is 8, pre-nerf raid states, etc.
---
Gating content isn't a frankenpatch.
---
They didn't fix anything iirc. If you just did emissary and made sure to turn those in and later paragon boxes after reset it was easy to stay in line with was required. The catch up mechanic reduces the amount you need by 30% each week for the first 10 since launch. And Now each week since 8.1 I mean I play my alt once a week maybe and he's neck lvl 45.
---
I mean, there are a number of significant impacts it will have.
---
* Faction imbalance - should the major streamers on a given realm not be offset by another major streamer on the other faction
---
* Resource competition - herb/mining may be especially painful if they are on constant farm by a large community
---
* World Bosses - With superior numbers they will likely be the first to know a boss is up, community members may troll people to ensure the streamer gets the kill
---
* Server firsts - Scarablord will undoubtedly go to the biggest streamer
---
* Server stability - potential for long queues or stability problems, especially early on
---
These are just off the top of my head. I'm sure there are other problems that we don't even know exist yet.
---
You can't compare retail and classic because they've introduce tech to get around a lot of these problems in retail. Classic won't have those same workarounds.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/L6TQOlm.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/L6TQOlm.jpg) \- Good times. Unfortunately my nat pagle boots was forcefully removed, but i was allowed to keep my hat on even after the level increase past 19.

Rogue was main I am going with shammy or lock. I eventually made these toons but later after vanilla

&gt;make you eat ass the whole time.
---
Where do I sign up?

I don't remember them cracking down on it during legion, was it during antorus?
---
I've spent the last 2 weeks playing nothing, every time I'm at my computer I'm just searching for things to do....All I have to look forward to before Classic is PoE's new league coming out next week
---
You do know that files can be copied to new harddrives, do you?
---
Not saying there aren't ways it will suck. I'm saying since we haven't seen it working as intended, we can't infer how it will work from bugs like OP
---
its a bummer
---
Thanks very much. 
---
Yea I will keep an eye out and let you know if I find something.
---
They seem to have moved them to Australian data centres in 2014: https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/23/world-of-warcraft-to-relocate-oceanic-servers-to-aussie-data-cen/
---
damn, that feels like such a long time to only be flagged as oceanic but still not be in AU
---
I use Winamp and Firefox since like the last 20 Years...
---
Still didnt exist prior to BC
---
My first server was Earthen Ring! I never got to end game there, but I'll never forget the first guildies that took me in, what an experience!
---
Sounds like a step in the right direction. if I ever play BFA again I'll try it out 👍
---
You absolute bastards!
---
Well done :D :D :D
---
You still have to wait for mail on live, unless it's a mail to your own alt. I'd imagine it's still like that in classic...
---
Now, getting your purchases from AH instantly may not have been in vanilla, I don't know tbh.
---
You have to find a specc that works for PvE and PvP.
---
WoW 2, lets go!
---
have this as a fabric poster in my room, good stuff
---
My favorite are burgers and fried chicken. Bonus if their combined.   
---
I also love my yogurt and thick shakes.   
---
Not much of a soft drink drinker.  
---
I do like alcohol but I rarely drink.   
---
I pretty much eat anything really even salad. Love my cucumbers.
---
&gt;But why are priests so low? People don’t like to heal?

Is this a trick question
---
My biggest waste of time in Vanilla was farming Cenarion Circle rep in silithus for DAYS/WEEKS to get exalted so i could get: https://www.wowhead.com/item=21190/wrath-of-cenarius.
---
I had the cascada album on loop for that grind. Young me had patience.
---
&gt;Which level is necessary for an alt to have acess to the bank system 
---
&gt;what race on horde side is the fastest to achieve it ( time/running to capital)
---
Undead, plus the layout of Undercity is pretty good for a bank-alt.
---
:(
---
Santhrax is a fucking idiot.
---
[mrbuds](https://www.twitch.tv/mrbudsz) is working on porting it to classic, it's already pretty far. Can see the pull request [here](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/pull/1347)
---
Slightly sarcastic, yes.
---
December 2006, in a PC World shop with some Christmas money. I m 10 years old. There is a stand with about 200 copies of this game called World of Warcraft, I read the box and it looks so cool, my dad said it would be a bit like the Planetside game I was playing at the time (lots of people). I said to him, "if I like it can i subscribe after the trial?" he said no problem, so I picked it up. I had no idea what I had just started that day.
---
Sometimes I think if I could go back in time, would I stop myself getting it? but honestly I would have probably just got it even earlier
---
I wouldn't even call it lazy. Asmon actually mentioned he has a business or finance degree of some kind and knows how to market himself. If he makes enough money without making youtube videos that he doesn't want to do or have time to do, and other people making them for free actually brings him more viewers in the end, it's a very smart and calculated move.
---
Plus instances are just fun.
---
I thought [Destiny] was somewhat overrated.
---
A game can have merits other than difficulty. Pretending like the game is really hard when it isn't doesn't help anything.
---
And more power to you! I'm absolutely sure the vast majority are in the same boat as you. I personally enjoy powerleveling and is what I'll do on my first character, but I have at least 1 more alt to revisit relaxed leveling on, with many dungeons thrown into the mix.
---
Sounds good. Yeah I do cucumbers in vinegar and salt, soak them and then eat them as snacks. Or cut tomatoes and cumbers up, Italian dressing then smash
---
It gets a lot better when you start getting some instant attacks like Whirlwind.
---
Layering isn't finished yet and bugs aren't conclusive to how something will work.
---
Also, that's an easy fix. Phase only when you are close enough to see party members in the world. That can solve a bunch of problems that can be introduced with layer hopping. 
---
Until they put a stamp of approval on Layering I'm going to assume, as a dev, they are working it out.
---
Example: the Borderlands resurrect feature that was talked about wasn't working in game until less than 48 hours before they had to show it working. It was bugged repeatedly.
---
Let it cook, raise concerns before it gets shipped but don't frame a bug as definitive proof as to how something works.
---
1% dodge man that's proper tanking racial
---
Not allowed in the EULA but sure if you can play them 24 hours a day you might make it
---
I would take a prot Pally over a Warrior to Scholomance/Strath every day.
---
Yes and this is why choosing a class is so hard for me. Because if we move forward to TBC or new content after naxx im pretty sure i want to play a druid, not so edcited for druid in classic tho. I want to main the same character forever this time around. I wanted to play priest in classic but do i want to have 2 heal specs and no melee spec forever? Hell no
---
Mage originally, going with a Priest this time around.
---
what really? so there was never a time where horde had heroism but alliance didn't? Man really got my shit wrong then
---
mm 'dat 4:3 aspect ratio
---
My classic main was an Undead Warlock.
---
Since this is the revival of the old game, my Warlock will be "revived" as well, so Human Warlock it is =)
---
Kinda hope Blizzard is able to block them
---
If you want a bank alt the best thing to do is to level to lvl5 so you can get disenchanting for all your leftover gear from your main. Well worth the 30 minutes it takes.
---
Its not wasted if you’re having fun. Thats the beauty of videogames
---
The gnolls in Redridge could do a number on you as well. Desparate Retaliation fights on the bosses.
---
&gt; And while you can afford to have 2 retards out of 5 in modern WoW,  because nothing kills you in dungeons...in Vanilla, a single retard can  fuck up the entire run. 
---
This is not true though. I don't remember a single dungeon where a person could fuck up in classic to the point of wiping an dungeon encounter for the group, beside aggroing a patrol or somethimg. I don't remember a single dungeon encounter where I had to immediatley step out of something because 2 ticks is death.  
---
&gt;And despite normal and heroic dungeons being tuned on the easier side, mythics and m+ ramp up in difficulty by a metric shitton. (Which take longer than 15 min. just saying.)
---
My guess is you haven't played retail in a while, right ?
---
&gt;Everyone knows that Sunken Temple is were players prove how good or bad they are. 
---
"Everyone". All I remember is that it is a labyrinth, where you frequently lose that one guy who goes afk. Nothing more or less.
---
So yeah, vanilla dungeons with 1 ability bosses are a cakewalk, not even sure why we argue that at all. Unless you pull too much, there should **never** be a reason to die.
---
 Lastly, your opinion of Vanilla dungeons being a walk in the park is based on very good players running lvl 30 dungeons.  
---
My opinion comes from playing vanilla, just saying.  
---
&gt; The other guilds will not set foot in AQ40, being stuck in MC and BWL. 
---
I'd bet that not far into the respective content patch, people will PUG MC, BWL, AQ20, ZG and eventually most of AQ40.
---
Competitivly Alliance is widely considered the better faction in vanilla though.
---
But we have a new content, it's called The Burning Crusade and Wrath of The Lich King. Also, how come big amount of people were able to play the game for the past 15 years on private servers without a single change being made to the original game (as far as the content goes)?
---
Because it's still being implemented, developed and tweaked while listening to community feedback.
---
We went from phasing everywhere to layering by continent from feedback alone. Keep up feedback but we don't need to label obvious bugs as finished products in a beta.
---
You should try to get it back honestly, what's the word that can happen? That you don't? that puts you in the same spot as now.
---
Yes I meant mass auto loot but 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
FUCKING THANK YOU
---
That's the main reason I always have to grin when someone says "people are much better palyers on average now!"
---
No, they are not =)
---
Most people sucked back then, most people suck today.
---
What AH problem?
---
Easily the best on /rclassicwow
---
Can't pave the way for BFA without Vanilla. No Vanilla, no BFA. Boom, problem solved.
---
So true, however I feel giddy like a child a few days before christmas, and I'm 4 decades past that age. I really have to force myself not to be overhyped about it and ruin the experience of the game for me when the release date comes.
---
I got in at 1.11. I was trying to play PVP as a rogue in PVE server, I realized my mistake at 60. This is how much of a noob I was.
---
&gt; What is a big deal however is the 3% hit you gain from 300-&gt;305 weapon skill
---
Huh? 0.04%, times 5(skill) times 4(miss/dodge/parry/block) equals 0.8%
---
No. Never.
---
I started balance druid in wotlk, heard they were shit in vanilla so.. I need to know if they release TBC and ulterior expansions on the same server as classic but I doubt it :D
---
Probably not druid if not
---
I'm fine with trading in these Bosses for having Kings and Salvation.
---
Idk why people think that level 20 dungeons were gonna be hard. 
---
Lower level dungeons are the only thing that's gonna be tougher on private servers cause there are no mechanics whatsoever so the generalized buffs to enemies there make it harder. People are in for a rude awakening once they get to the actual high level dungeons and raids which will be much harder than private servers even with the mobs having more health hitting for more etc.
---
The transparent raid health bars... we must go back
---
It's the same for every game I'd say
---
Delusions of grandeur are in abundance on Reddit sadly 
---
I know Rogues that delude themselves to be some kind of ganking legends and have told me how there were 20+ rage threads on forums about them back in the day xD
---
You completely missed the second part of my post. Classic was a coherent, single world - Azeroth. With it's coherent feel and aesthetics, and it was huge. Outland was a completely different world for max level players (58+) that you was teleported to through a portal.
---
&gt; Which is a bad example since the capital &amp; max lvl players are still there in BFA
---
It's not a bad example because almost all expansions had its own capital NOT in the old world.
---
While I don't have any screenshot from vanilla and sadly lost my screenshots from TBC, I do have plenty screenshots from Wotlk. It's not like you can't back them up, not to mention 15 years is nothing for unpowered hard drive.
---
I played arms warrior (mostly pvp) for last 15 years. I wanted to recreate my old Warrior, but i know what to expect and what experience will be like. I want something fresh so I decided to go rogue this time. :)
---
Let's say you play a human warrior during the beta. Will you enjoy playing the same race and class again once Classic is out? After lvl 30 for sure, but before that it's just going to be the same thing again.
---
Maybe it'll be as fun for you as it was the first time, but I doubt it.
---
Yes, you could hide them from Interface options
---
The economy (in my opinion), will take a good while to become established.  
---
There will not be a huge excess of gold, till at least 6-10 months after release.  By all means, the speed levelers and the hard core players will all make 60 first, but this isnt really the target audience for the economy. Its the average/casual players, who want to raid and PVP once they get to 60.  
---
They'll need to get sufficient gold and have bought their epic mount, well before they start power leveling professions and such using the AH. 
---
It could even take a year before the economy is well established and people have spare cash to spend.
---
I used Kazaa. I got so many viruses.

The worst is the chat and how they try to laugh about soda who absolutely wrecked 7 people with his mate. Its not that anybody is an absolute highlight or a noob in this clip. Its just a good fight but people cant stop hating other streamers just because theyre in someone elses chat. I hate those kids.
---
Hi friend :) I do not think the difficulty of the dungeons is going to make or break classic. Its the forced social interaction combined with the slowed down pace and the feel of a dangerous word that makes classic enjoyable for many. Of course opinions differ, but changing the game from its original state to make it a bigger challenge than it was seems like a strange and wrong thing to do in my opinion. Each hes own ofc. Have a great day btw :)
---
Is there somewherr a thread or homepage where I can read about spell dmg ret pala?
---
It looks really weird, especially towards the end, I must admit. But maybe some of the damage numbers were just messed up back then.
---
which is exactly the reason for my curiosity regarding matters related to ability coefficients &amp; threat values as in the end they play a major role.
---
If possible i would like to know if certain items like arcane bomb, stratholme holy water &amp;  Neretzek, The Blood Drinker scales with spell power as it did back then. but sadly to test engineering or the other things properly the cap would need to at least be raised to 35 or higher :/
---
&gt; was it during antorus?
---
It was during or after nighthold. High profile raiders got banned. People were salty.
---
As a company no matter how many times they have been bought or sold there main goal will always be to make mony. This will always lead to what can we do to increase our revenue as much as possible and if you think that lying and intentionally sabotaging for your customer especially in areas that are easy and bound to be checked you have a very special way of looking on the world.
---
I guess. I'm also biased in the fact that most of those things don't really concern me. Namely the world first, and world bosses. Don't get me wrong, you have very valid points, but I'm not holding my breath because things are going to moralize when the hype dies out and people get bored, then move on.
---
Resource competition is going to be a thing regardless if you have a streamer or not, because you have hardcore guilds that have hardcore needs, and they have the dedicated farmers to do it, I would even bet people would have gank patrols to help their farmers (specifically for PvP servers).
---
Faction imbalance has always been a thing, since the servers launched out of beta back in '04. Will having a streamer help tip the scales a little further? Sure, but you're not going to solve the problem by segregating the streamers.
---
Server stability, again, is more on the fact of the massive amounts of people who come in and hit it. blizzard will spool up and down servers depending on the needs and how many concurrent players there are (duh!). 
---
I'm sure at the start, thing are going to be fucking crazy, but give it a year for the hype to die down. Everyone (including certain streamers) to get bored and move on to new content. A lot of these guys are riding the hype to get new content, get some new viewers, and when the hype dies down, they will move on to the new thing.
---
one of the best looking swords in the game
---
You create either a Troll or Orc and once you spawn, you go southwest, jump down the hill, die, respawn at the graveyard in Ratchet and walk to the bank. Should take about 2 Minutes.
---
The only mechanic that I really remember giving some groups problems was during the rock boss right before Princess.  He had a knock-back ability that on several occasions, knocked a few people in the group off the edge of the cliff because they didn't have their back to a wall.
---
&gt; Fingers crossed that the nochanges crowd will come around by then.
---
I think that ship has sailed a **long** time ago.
---
They are all easy. A  Tauren can easily run to Thunderbluff in about 5 mins once made. Same with the Orc/Troll running through Durotar.   
---
But as someone suggested, best level the alt to 5, and then take enchanting, so you can DE all greens you dont need or wont sell.  Getting to level 5 wouldnt take longer than 20-30 mins.
---
If you want to have a really quick bank alt upon release - make an Orc.
---
Jump down towards Ratchet from the Orc Spawn Point (there is a Little ledge if you turn into the right wing of the orc spawn)
---
You will have a Mailbox and a Bank next to each other within like 2mins of Walking :)
---
It's really strange that this needs to be pointed out.
---
There were but they weren't as accurate as the blizzard one, at least not the ones I used.
---
People keep talking about burnout but I had about 500 days /played by 2009 and I only quit because I got married. 
---
You rookies need to pump those levels up.
---
Only bans to high level raiders I remember was people in Limit being banned for selling boosts for RMT during ToS.
---
I don't think any high profile raiders got banned for acc sharing and I can't find anything when I google for it
---
No problem!
---
In certain situations.

When your tank's fear immunity runs out before a dragon fears him, tremor pulses seem awfully far apart.

I feel the same, the only thing im jaelous about is getting in on the stresstests cuz it looks like so much fun.
---
Definitely not trying to promote it though :D honestly looking for something else to do untill Classic so I can quit.
---
is there a version of ABar that works?
---
You know what's more annoying than anything? People projecting stuff onto posts that just isn't there.
---
I complained about the way the thumbnails and titles of Asmonvideos are made. At no point did I bash Asmon. I specifically mentioned that I don't mind him and enjoy some of his content and yet you cannot stop yourself from interpreting it in a way that allows you to bitch about my comment.
---
THAT is really more annoying than anything.
---
I tried to link so much stuff but people refuse to believe that dmg taken didn't scale with level.
---
Not enough mama.
---
I can't do that.
---
6 for rogue
---
Play whatever class and spec you like. Find a good guild, with helpful people who you enjoy the company of. Once you do this, you'll be able to raid as pretty much any class. 
---
A guild will take a good player, who is on time, has tried to get the best gear they can, even if limited time, and who gathers their own mats for consumables / buffs etc, over someone who is unreliable and late for raids. 
---
Play what you enjoy!
---
I would disagree, only for the matter that we dont play end game content but this fun lvl 30 end game That is different and new and fun and never coming back again. I wouldve loved to play that.
---
Dude there are mechanics, that last few years vanilla servers have been on very high quality and some have buffed raid content by up to 50%. We have to wait and see but so fair i am convinced classic will be heaps easier than privates
---
Oh, good god you're obnoxious.
---
Everyone got ganked in Vanilla at some point. Then you level up and gank other people levelling alts.
---
Will he do premade fights against the horde guys again?
---
&gt;And yeah I know classic is grindy too, but at least classic wow has better class design. Playing each alt feels like a different game/playstyle.
---
People toss that one around quite often, but I don't get it honestly. The classes are, gameplay-wise, equally samey and different all throughout WoW IMO.  
---
A rogue doesn't play like a warrior on retail. They're both melees though. Same goes for classic.   
---
Classic warlocks spam shadowbolt, mages frostbolt. It's basicly the same, but people overlook that one on purpose ?  
---
Now one could argue, locks create soulstones, healthstones, portals and have pets while mages do citiy portals food and drinks. But that is still the case in retail, so again. I don't get the endless, seemingly inaccurate hate for retail class design.  
---
But maybe, you don't mind explaining that to me.
---
As you...im totally mindfucked now hahaha i couldve sworn there was a time in which this was a thing
---
I'm the same as you, my main was a hunter. I raided pretty hard core till Cata was released, and I got to level 12 in PVP. But I was enjoying playing my shammy healer more in BGs and PVP when I stopped playing. 
---
So still not totally decided what class I will role / start with.  
---
I am kinda worried about how poor a shammy will be to make gold, compared to my hunter who it was easy to gold farm on.
---
Please go be salty somewhere else.
---
It's easy to produce content. Reaction videos began with TV shows, I believe - celebrity reaction to Game of Thrones Red Wedding episode etc.
---
As for the streamers, I believe you can remove certain videos from your feed via a dropdown, citing that you're not interested. Otherwise, you can block channels that share the content.
---
Thank you for your advice, will do!
---
You are apparently mistaken, but it sounds like a good tip, so thanks! My original choice of fiery war axe was because there was one on the auction house. I didn't really twink properly as far as gear went. I pretty much settled for 'good enough'.
---
People are less likely to engage in pvp without some sort of incentive. I've seen it on pservers that had that delayed honor system. Couple it with dead 3k pop layers, there wont be that much action tbh.
---
Was your character moved to a separate account? I had the unfortune of a hacker transfering my vanilla druid to another account and wasn’t able to recover it back in the day. 
---
Grats on your warrior btw, respect!
---
This. I have never watched twitch as much as i have since beta came out. Tipsout and that gang is really enjoyable to watch.
---
Same i really want to go feral, but I think it’ll be trash 😫 everyone is slamming them!
---
Warlocks are amazing in PvP at all gear levels. They have a very useful toolkit its just that sense it's quite a BIG kit it can be a bit intimidating on what to do in certain situations until you get real comfortable with it.
---
Basic level PvP which is the level most people will be playing at usually just becomes a game of attrition. Can I damage my opponent down faster than they can damage me or outlast them more than they can me. Paladins usually shine at this level of PvP because they are basically built to last.  
---
The best classes for PvP are probably Warlock, Rogue, and Hunter just because they have such a verastile toolkit with good dmg and control. When it comes to PvP control is king.
---
Warriors scale the best with gear but any class can run circles around them because they are so easy to manipulate.
---
either you are very new on the job market and havent ever been part in large scale choices or you are still in school...
---
fact is lying is a common thing among companies, and no its not sabotaging themselves and even if their lie is caught they have plenty blind fools like you who forgives or forgets it in a week...
---
i am sorry for shaking up your fragile little soap bubble world but in business you consider ups &amp; downs for lying &amp; truth along with what the consequences are...
---
About spriests melting faces
---
I believe there is a video from Nihilum Progressing through Naxxramas and they were still clicking.
---
However, this is not the only reason for the game being harder back then. Other things that made the game harder (compared to today):
---
Bad Talents (before 1.12)
---
Bad Servers (Lag)
---
Bad Connections (Low Frames)
---
Less Support (much less access to sites like MMORPG-Champion)
---
Less Communication Technology (using TS2, Ventrilo etc.)
---
Less Skill &amp; Knowledge (ppl didn't go for 40x Engineering etc. in their raids back then)
---
Completely agree. It's all from the toxic followers that they have. Imagine sitting there and putting a video of some guys reaction on the internet. It's just weird. 
---
Their harddrives need seizing immediately and checked.
---
Where can I find the current theory results?
---
5
---
I mostly agree with you. It felt bad ass to get into BT/MH knowing that most ppl on the server couldnt. But The difference is that in vanilla it was only start raids that had attunements. The endgame raids didnt (naxx only cost lots of gold). The guild drama starts when you have to tell ppl to do non progress raids. And killing vashj and kt is not something you do just like that. But this debate is something that is going to get real heated the day blizz announce tbc
---
Its the awsome youtube algoritm. You watch one and it then recommends all of them. And about why there are do much reaction videos? Becuase if you are mainly pve player you are limited to making guides, wow news, lore and reaction shit.
---
What I guess I meant to say with this thread, which I've probably done a bad job of, is that there is a lot of investment attached to a character instead of your account. So if you WANT to deck out your character and farm all these rare items then its a more important decision with which character you're going to do it on.
---
why does everyone start their sentence with "i like streamers but" it's like the sentence "im not racist but" lmao
---
Tremor ticks at a set interval after placing it. Good shamans can time it well.
---
The whole "Remember horde can clear bosses with fear mechanics, so fear ward means nothing" is so triggering to me, because you're willfully leaving out tremor totem. Fear Ward ***IS*** the tremor totem of Alliance. Try doing Nefarian without tremor totem and you'll see a whole more god damn wipes, I'll guarantee it.
---
Yesterday I stumbled on abomination where streamer reacted to reaction video of his video... Holy fucking shit.
---
In my experience warrior dps is exceptionally low before they get access to level 60 gear. I almost always see ret paladins and feral druids above them while leveling. 
---
Might just be a quirk of the private servers so I guess I'll eat my words once Classic is out.
---
Lol fanboys
---
Just more horde bias in gear. Classic is filled with it.
---
How do you find out the age of your account? I played classic but have no idea when i started
---
It's nice to think I was a 1%-er then.
---
Was a complete noob levelling my pala to 60 (as a prot/ret hybrid), didn't like healing so rolled a druid (yeah, class descriptions...). Finally got my act together with the druid and cleared Ony, MC, BWL, ZG and AQ20. Guild died hard on Skeram in AQ40 and I never got to see Naxx till Wrath, looking forward to this so much now.
---
Look who's using the name plates script
---
No it wasn't, naturally I wouldn't be able to make this post if it was. :)
---
Same, this should not exist in classic, hopefully it it is released the majority of the population will avoid it
---
I believe he went to business school for sure and worked for the IRS for a good bit as well. He's definitely not stupid, though I can see why people only exposed to the highlight moments of him would have that take away.
---
&gt;There is a reason private servers started buffing boss armor and damage by 20 to 50% since 2010, real vanilla is too easy.
---
Or yknow it's due to the hilariously broken AI on pservers...
---
I like this mentality
---
I don't have a career I run a business
---
What you do is fundamentally different than what I do
---
If you are wondering why you dont get any data uploaded from beta players: Your client asks on first launch for location of Wow.exe but beta only has WowB.exe ...
---
I was an officer in my guild during tbc. Telling people that you gonna do non progress raids for a stranger is when the guild drama start and the tryhards starts to look for other guilds.
---
I'm pretty sure it began with 2 girls 1 cup reaction videos.
---
Sorry, my bad, they don't account share, they just transfer characters between accounts so it's not against the rules
---
Get a mouse that has numkeys on the side, it’s a literal gamechanger for MMOs.
---
The UI is called photek. Very common in Vanilla and TBC.
---
In all honesty, the shield and sword are both transmogs. I was using https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19349/elementium-reinforced-bulwark and https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22806/widows-remorse when I quit, but both have been vendored.
---
I hope classic will be as fun as vanilla was.
---
I have decided on paladin. Not sure what race/sex to play. I have mained a human male character on retail for 4 years, and I believe everyone will play it so I want to try something different. Dont care that much for human female. That leaves dwarfs. As much as I adore the male dwarfs I dislike their animations. Thier run animation looks a bit silly and their attack and special attack animation are horrible imo. They stand super hunched over and just whack things.  As a paladin, I expect to be autoattacking a lot, so I must like the animations. Proccing Seal of Command must feel exciting and that spin move does not do it for me.
---
That brings me to female dwarves. A lot of prejudice exists against them, but they are starting to grow on me. They look good in armor, have good animations and their special attack reminds me of human males jump atttack which I love. Also the spinning ponytails for casting!
---
Should I roll female dwarf? I'm a male irl and I dont want to bait anyone. How do you guys feel about playing a character of opposite gender?
---
You will always have different experiences in classic wow, even when you're doing the same thing again. There will be different people and different opportunities.
---
I don't even paeticularly want to level up a rogue again, but I've always had the same main and I'm not about to switch now. Although I'm rolling a druid to raid with.
---
imagine defending a company that makes more per year than you will ever make in your entire life
---
*That would be stealing!*
---
I hate that on a **rogue**...
---
How is this a fanboy post? It's interesting to see who gets the #1 spot in the honor system beta, and it would be just as interesting if it was a non-streamer or whatever.
---
Hell yeah, and I’m definitely gonna do it again for sure
---
I’m happy to wait and not even look into it until the launch day.. waiting will be worth it to experience the madness and excitement the first day of MMO brings.
---
thats what they want you to think
---
Vanilla was actually very alt friendly. After you get your alt raid ready you're basically "done" with it. Also some classes really really want alts to farm with. It's the later expansions and especially legion with legendaries and artifact power that are hostile to alts.
---
My brother was gkicked for accepting the queue in the middle of an MC clear (we were very young and didn't realize it was a shitty thing to do).
---
He only did it because we had spent days trying to join AV and that's when it finally popped.
---
I think our server had poor balanc or was just generally low pop.
---
Thanks, you're the change the world needs. Let's have fun on Wow Classic, and manage difficulties no matter the class/spec we use.
---
I guess it was us, alliance youngling plebs, making up excuses to why horde used to be better than us at raiding
---
Vanilla handed success to subsequent expansions on a silver platter.  TBC did a couple things right but mostly just made the game worse.  See all of my aforementioned points.
---
I remember being able to zerg the end boss out of desperation if you fell behind, but if you didn't take or keep the deep graveyard then it was easy to wipe 'em with just a few defenders.
---
I also remember power leveling a rogue just so I could play AVs and take towers behind enemy lines.
---
AV is still plenty fun! At least... that's how I remember it. Ha.
---
Yeah true, didn't boss knockback in earlier dungeon. RFC?
---
Also shout out to GM Hjalkur who helped me to get my old bull back!
---
You can get the frst single use essence by grinding silithus elementals and MC thrash. In theory a guild with the explicit goal of downing mc fast could spent the last 5 levels grinding rep in silithus to 60.
---
I've mained a pally, hunter, rogue, druid, monk, and lock in different xpacs across my wow career. I think I'm gonna main a resto shammy to give me something new.
---
This used to be my desktop wallpaper in high school... nostalgia is high right now.
---
I went mostly male characters at first. I think after MoP I started to favor female characters.   
---
Still not sure what class I'm gonna play but it will be either a female Forsaken, Night elf or Human.
---
Level 5 for 1-225
---
Level 35 for 225-300
---
Nope, you need to be level 35 to max professions I believe.
---
Unfortunately, talking about streamers here is a big no no here and will get you hit with the downvote hammer and shunned from the community.
---
Especially since most of us 30s in the beta are decked out pretty seriously gearwise
---
Thanks
---
Strength and AP don't give paladin enough value, pretty much only judgement and soc procs scale on it which is pretty pathetic compared to a warrior or rogue's AP scaling. There are only a handful of very strong AP coaficients on items, but there are a ton of spellpower coaficients on items and consumables. By opting into a spellblade type build, prioritizing melee hit, melee crit, and spellpower over all other stats, you can use external spell coaficients to outpace standard ret builds, and even push your way into pretty competitive dps with. 
---
We've tested a handful of things on the PTR and so far the build is a go. It can literally only get better. 
---
We don't have access to a lot of level 60 on hit weapons to test, but SoC is proccing on hit weapon effects, so if there is a perticuarly good spell coaficient on a piece, it's worth looking at. There are multiple weapons, that according to datamining and client side data, which admitantly may not be 100% accurate, its datamining, that have insane scaling or the capacity to give the build an incredible utility weapon. For example, there is a polearm that can proc for a 15 or 30 second 100% SP scaling thorns effect that stacks with retri aura. A handful of HP5 weapons are supposed to have SP scaling HP regeneration. We can't 100% safely assume a lot of these coefficient weapons will work, but it doesn't matter if they do or they dont because we already do 450+ in prebis with a build we know will work based on current testing. Even if every last bit of theorycrafting we're doing from here on out falls flat, the class is already viable. 
---
Shadow Oil and Dragonbreath Chilli both have spell coaficients. It's on hit spellpower ret. Mega RNG spec, but it pulls its weight. A good player who knows how to down/uprank Consecration around Vengeance correctly will do higher DPS than the sims. Sims are looking very good, but cant really take into account dynamic spell ranking based on procs like a player can. 
---
The spellret build looked like a private server meme at first, I personally didn't think ret would ever be more than a memespec, but we're genuinely pushing it into the upper middle of the pack with what we're doing. 
---
Here's a pure PvE raiding build [https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sIVzZVhZEf0xbcq](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sIVzZVhZEf0xbcq) 
---
Here's my generalist all purpose endgame build that really isnt much worse at all [https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sIVzZVhZVfotrcqo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sIVzZVhZVfotrcqo)
---
Move points around in holy tier 1 based on your gear, usually 5/5 int is better, but it depends on your gear. There are a handful of free points, but the most important is 3 hit from prot, consecration and Imp SoR in holy, and veangence and sanctity aura from ret. Almost everything else is pretty flexible. I take SoC+repentance for PvP and other out of raid content. 
---
Ironfoe and Manual Crowd Pummeler are currently simming as our BiS, with Blade of Hanna coming in at third. We want fast weapons to get as many procs from non-normalized PPM sources as possible. More procs means more spellpower calculations, and the more spellpower calculations we run, the more damage we do. The gear that would naturally not do so well on us does great with external scaling. 
---
The build is a collection of janky items interacting synergystically between each other and the Paladin kit. The Paladin kit on its own does not do enough damage, but it's go so many scaling points and aspects to leverage, and if it just had even a few more coefficients baseline, we wouldn't need any of this and the class would be perfectly viable along side warrior. We can't really match warrior, but we can reach into the 'viable/optimal' dps range pretty easily. 
---
There are all these interesting synergies for a spellblade type character that never got explored. We're exploring them now.
---
change , if i hate what i change to i can always switch to the old main that i loved back then.
---
if i need to change class once it wont be a huge deal .
---
also i was caster dps up till wrath then healer wrath and i really enjoyed being a healer, so id like to be the solid dependable healer for a good guild on my server. 
---
i love pulling a group through when they fuck up, i know ill enjoy healing but i have no idea how ill make gold because i wont be farming solo on a healer
---
Perfect

I was terrible, I rolled a ret paladin. Played it that way to 60 all the way to TBC and then to level 70. In vanilla think I only ran a few dungeons ever, and one raid ZG. Was so confused by the raid I swore it off all together. I was clueless. Did her my epic paladin mount, master Sgt title from running AV alot, and was a maxed out engineer and enchanter. Never saw MC, AQ or Nax in Vanilla, though I did help in the AQ war effort and watched one of the scarab lord dragon fights and when the gates open went to silithus for the lag battle. Again, I was clueless about everything then.

Here is a video covering some of the earlier talents to the 1.12.1, obviously not the same as a direct nerf to the dungeons, but it will definitely have an impact, depending on the difference in talents.
---
On Modern (I refuse to call it 'retail' when both Classic and Modern are both legit, purchased products), my favorite title is "the Proven Healer" because I love healing.
---
But I also find it hilarious that I can use that title on my mage...
---
I want TBC greatly. I knew from the get go that the only way to get would be to throw my lot in with the demand for Classic, so here I am. Been here for a while toting the whole "No Changes" mantra.
---
If Classic proves successful and we get TBC down the line, great. If no TBC well then at least I get to play WoW without warforging or titanforging.
---
The mobs in beta use way more abilities than on pservers. SM GY is a lot harder on beta not that it's hard just harder
---
Fastest is getting an orc/troll down to Ratchet, but do you expect you'll need immediate access to anything you send to the bank alt? I probably won't log in to my bank alt for at least a week and when that happens I'll first run it Sentry Hill and use the mailbox there before relocating to Orgrimmar.
---

yeah, its just a discord. [https://discord.gg/aHNGN7](https://discord.gg/aHNGN7)

Can't decide on what class to play. I want a class that can handle themselves alone in WPvP and that has a high skill cap with lots of outplay potential. I also want to raid (and therefore be able to find dungeon groups and get into a guild). I was in a good progression guild in Cata and Wrath that got a few realm firsts as Resto druid and later Boomkin, so I'll probably be better than average (although I haven't played since Firelands). I don't really want to play druid again in Vanilla but I did really enjoy the gameplay of boomkin, cat and resto. It's really important that the class I pick can handle as many different aspects of the game as possible (even premade bgs) without me feeling gimped by my class. I really want a class that I can always learn more and improve on. Thoughts?
---
Oh nothing in specific! In fact I don't think there is one in westfall.
---
Question is way too specific for me.
---
those 2 look dope too esp the shield its a classic
---
I have babyhands, too... I don't bind abilities further than 5 or 6, and those are for longer coolodowns/situational abilities. Make use of Q, E, R, T, etc.
---
Well no but DM=Deadmines.
---
Same as BFA, but a few things like focus removed.
---
It also means Dire Maul depending on the context...
---
The whole playstyle is designed to mitigate otherwise disastrous bad luck in terms of misses at crucial moments by keeping skills in reserve, managing targets and positioning carefully, keeping the group focused as well as safe. it's a very different beast and it absolutely requires skills, just not piano skills which personally i don't find impressive or interesting.
---
Hang thought about click to move. I'll try it out, thanks!
---
Dw BRD is still gonna be rough
---
i did some testing it seemed to be the same as retail
---
i only checked a few of the more modern things i like to use but they worked
---
As pointed out by others, tehre are caps.
---
However, there is no level requirement for DISENCHANTING items, meaning even a bank alt can DE for you.
---
A decision cannot be hard If it includes rolling a female dwarf. Unless it's of the " would you rather have your dick cut off or be forced to play dwarf female" kind.
---
Dwarf females looks like shit is what I'm trying to say :D
---
I linked a discord and gave a long writeup responding to two comments responding to the one i made that you responded to. 
---
TLDR, fast weapon, melee crit, melee hit, and spellpower. It's a janky build, but it's great.
---
I plan on going blacksmithing/engineering at 60 in classic, but was thinking about doing mining/skinning just for gold while leveling. Or would it be better to take blacksmithing with mining from the start?
---
A readme, which gives an overview of what each file is for, would be a nice addition.
---
Yeah +1
---
there will be a lot of mages, but there will also be a lot of mage slots in raids due to their high dps. they are also very good in 5 mans because of water and polymorph.
---
priests are the best healer in pvp horde side, yeah.
---
Thank you. I will try to use it to filter streamer posts, i was looking for something lime this.
---
I often got the impression guys play female toons to perv on them. Maybe I'm wrong.
---
On my paladin back in classic we worked our way to the stables with 2 paladins total in the group. Wasn't that difficult but took a while. I'm fairly sure that with level 22 and some deadmines loot and buffs i could solo it to this point.
---
I think you have to have tamed a pet that knows screech for it to learn it.
---
Basically the good players will be better. Everyone else will still be pretty shit.
---
Yeah I don’t think I’ll have enchanting on my main if I can just do it on my alt, thanks.
---
Damn, no scripting macros then :-(
---
Well it's pretty easy atm since we're all in half BIS blues. People are running armory and lib at 30 pretty regularly an farming GY 5 times an hr
---
I pretty much always play the opposite gender, doesn’t phase me. Someone described it to me this way ages ago: “if i’m going to stare at the back of a character for hours at a time, i’d rather it be a girls butt”
---
Just tell them the name of the old account (pre- battle net email accounts) and they’ll get it immediately. Took me 2 mins to get it back.
---
Man those sapper charges wrecked them.
---
Wasted on a cow. Smh.
---
The idea I thought was that each layer would just fill up to a point, and upon reaching that point, a new world is created for anyone who logs in after. Mathematically, that makes sense. It's not that each layer doesn't theoretically support above 3000 players, it's because of (starting/early) zone congestion.
---
BUT, server load aside, my question then is... Doesn't that mean we will regularly have 1+ full layers basically constantly at launch, and possibly one close to empty layer..? As layer one reaches 3000/3000, layer 2 *may* be just 200/3000. I know which one I would rather level on, that's for sure...
---
It would make sense, then, to shift players between layers as more at created. So instead of 3000/3000 + 1/3000, it evens out to 1500/3000 + 1500/3000 and tries to fill both evenly.
---
But blizz has made some promise that it won't be sharding, you're not going to phase back and forth without joining groups... Maybe it's only supposed to change your layer in a rested area, or some other "low activity" area where it would matter less?
---
I really wonder how they are solving this, it'd be reassuring to hear more in depth how it works for sure. Maybe they aren't 100% themselves yet. I like the idea in theory anyway, as the launch will be unplayable without it.
---
&gt; Now we seem to be on the subject of how easy Vanilla was
---
I played Vanilla (account creation was mid-February 2005, when it launched in the EU), and as said before, I raided at a medium level: Too occupied with Real Life to farm raid consumables to the gills for every run, but also too driven to be complacent about just having BWL on farm.
---
Of course I started out as a newbie, but I had guild mates that had been in the CB, so I got learned fast. While we certainly weren't competition in world first kills, we did crunch the numbers and we did develop our own strategies for quite some bosses.
---
That all said, the current discussion about Vanilla WoW being too easy has two major components I feel that get missed a lot: 
---
- Firstly, Vanilla never was hard as in Dark-Souls-hard. It was *engaging* in that demanded a certain level of mental engagement to succeed. You could not tune out mentally and succeed - you'd get stomped hard and fast. That's where the meme around the Sons of Arugal came from: It wasn't *hard* to avoid them, but you did have to pay attention. If you focused too little on your surroundings, they could well jump you. 
---
- Secondly, the level cap is 30 right now. As most veterans can attest, content gets more difficult the closer to 60 you are: Mobs have more HP, deal more damage, and their abilities become nastier. The reason Defias Pillagers (and Westfall boars) are so well remembered is because their abilities did an insane amount of damage compared to other mobs in the zone. This means that most of those other mobs weren't near as deadly - which makes sense, since Westfall still is a newbie zone. But start Tanaris at around 40, and you'll notice that the mobs have a jump in difficulty (e.g. Wastewander mobs, especially those summoners), and there's another jump in difficulty when you transition from Zul'Farrak to the BRDs, and another to Stratholme, and another to Dire Maul. Point being: Vanilla increases in difficulty, and level 30 is just where newbiedom ends, and intermediary territory starts. *Of course* it's easy for people that know what they're doing and who apply their brains and attention. That's what makes Vanilla *work*: If you run around braindead, you'll gonna have a bad time, but if you pay attention, it's quite enjoyable. Compare this to current retail where you do not have to apply your brain even for a second between character creation and max level.
---
Not on either side, but always see this go both ways.
---
👀  
---
That might be my new profession plan for my main.

Rose tinted glasses because they don't agree with you?

Isn't that what everyone was calling the people that wanted classic??..........and look where we are now 👍
---
Druid Bear Tank could pop out of Bear Form, Cast Nature's Swiftness, Cast Something (Innervate the healer, heal themsevles, battle res someone?), then pop back into Bear Form.
---
Timed right, and in a macro, this could happen between enemy swings.
---
I mean I'm not a healer but I'd sure hate healing that tank against drak and the pulls before him in ubrs. They hit like trucks
---
It's not an analogue stick, it's a very sensitive and clicky 8-way mechanical hat switch / d-pad, plus additional thumb buttons above and below it for extra utility.
---
Here's what the d-pad sounds like:

---
You have to tame a specific pet that has the ability, use the ability with that pet until YOU learn the ability and then you can teach your other pet(s) the ability through pet training, provided that they can learn it. Hope this helps.
---
Other races are viable. But dwarf priest is best priest? Because of fear ward? No, because you're a dwarf, you're keeping your raid alive while drunk, and punching anyone who calls your robes a dress.
---
What I hate is when they clickbait you to watch an anime and 3/4 of the screen is their reaction, and the anime is playing in the corner of the vid.

Just be prepared to have your stomach hurt like a mother fucker, probably get nauseous, and have to go take a runny diarrhea shit a few times a day since your body isn't used to it.
---
I took a slightly different approach for this. I thought of a few bad ideas and tried to make it work. The Warlock is a personal favorite, slap on a Perditions Blade, grab some Shadow Oil, and pray for nightfall procs.

Hi, /u/MaltaDuDe
---
Personally I think female dwarf is the second ugliest choice in the game, behind female tauren. Paladins don't really get much from their racials. The weapon skill thing on humans is pretty nice and of course the rep bonus is nice to have. Dwarves get stoneform but you already have cleanse, treasure hunting is actually pretty good and there are loads of secret ways it can be used. 
---
And about playing the opposite sex, there are two ways of looking at it. Whoose arse do you want to look at for hundreds or thousands of hours? And your character being an avatar of yourself in some way, which means you see yourself as the opposite sex? For me it's the second part so I will always play the same sex.

I use Wowhead because I consider them the best wow info site out there. Your obvious hate boner for them is not relevant here.

How are the campaigns? Pretty cinematic at times like d3? Never played Warcraft titles only WoW.
---
I was originally going to play my rogue again, but a buddy wants to so I need to settle for something else haha.
---
Well I'm having hella fun in the beta
---
The only “challenge” in Vanilla was time. And everyone is still going to get that challenge. 
---
Gearing will still be slow as fuck. Leveling is still going to be slow. It’s still going to take an hour or more to do the long dungeons. 
---
It’s still going to have the same time commitment (and therefore the sense of accomplishment) that Vanilla had, at least for the vast majority of people. And if people are speed running it and finishing it way faster that’s on them not Blizzard.
---
You don't have to turn 100% of the time with right click calm down
---
Exactly. I don't know why people are downvoting me when it's obvious that phasing in and out of a layer has to happen at some point. Like you say they could do it out of combat or in cities or something.
---
Blizz made a promise that is impossible to keep as i see it. Unless they have a set amount of layers, but that sort of defeats the purpose of layering.
---
They stated in the blue post that all people who were invited to the 1st stress test have access to the May 29th stress test.
---
Nope, not at all. Some of these were viable best option raiding specs.
---
30 Holy 21 Prot is the defacto build for holy paladins who bring Blessing of Sanct to the raid. You can also offtank. The 30 points in holy is literally all you need to be the best paladin healer you can - the other 21 points make no difference to your healing power so you can use them to bring a new group buff to the raid, and as a side issue you also become able to tank really well.
---
It's not secret at all - look it up. It's a common raid spec and let you do two roles fine. Same with Feral/Resto, it was the best spec for decursing fights. You didnt want everyone with it but it was a viable spec for a druid to have as a dedicated healer with a huge mana pool.
---
Being a dick would be speccing full feral or full ret/prot with only about 10-11 points in a healing tree and not telling anyone. The hybrid builds were good and viable and often you WANTED one of those specs in the raid to make it more versatile.
---
Priorities are a fun to level class, a good class for pvp and semi-casual friendly.
---
Yeah i'm a big advocate of them buffing the content. We have 1.12 talents and itemization and people are way better at the game, just flat out increase all hp, armor and dmg by 25% for raid bosses.
---
Rogue, Mage, Hunter
---
I know I played a Dwarf Hunter before they released WSG, but it was on a Mac and the game ran like absolute shit lol. Then I switched to Horde and got to like lvl 53 or so on an Orc Hunter. Never did get to vanilla end game.
---
He coulda said brojah
---
I've been a DPS for the last 15 years with a little stint in tanking during Wrath. I want to play a healer, specifically either a Holy Pally or a Disc/Holy Priest. Which would be better to take on as a beginner to healing? I'm kind of scared and intimidated by it because of the amount of healing spells and these multiple ranks to use.
---
She didn’t? I don’t think you know what you’re talking about. And I don’t really carry what trumps doing. Still better than Hillary.
---
i played vanilla but was a terrible clicker , clicking shit like dethcoil lol
---
i actually have videos of me playing like that lol 
---
i just didnt know better back then , i remember googling how i should do bindings and not finding anything much. 
---
i think 1-5 was spells and potions and i got good at clicking everything else.
---
that said i cleared every raid multiple times , i was attuned to nax but i never raided it, not sure if people quit to wait for bc or what.
---
chances are if people played vanilla and are going to play classic they were pretty trash back then. for most kids wow was a first mmo and you dont generally start out really good and there were no videos telling you how to play 
---
i never did but keyboard turners were also common lol people just did not know how tonmmo back in the day
---
I played the majority of vanilla as a female dwarf named Mangina (later changed to Magina because I was reported).  It's amazing how much a female dwarf with infuriate people in PVP.  Stoneskin is awesome, especially against rogues, druids and to a lesser extent warriors.  The animated hair is fairly cool and the tier 1 and 2 sets look amazing on them.
---
Racist
---
I reckon you roll mage. Good 1v1 and 1vX with cc and good damage. Good in bgs with aoe and good damage for dungeons and raids. You’ve played caster before so will be used to playing caster and mage is high skill cap class to play well.
---
You assume we steal gear. You know absolutely fucking nothing about the new build. You also assume I'm pugging at 60? You expect me to pug for my prebis farming? That sounds like an absolute nightmare. How the fuck do you expect loot drama in guild runs? I wouldnt be talking about preraid gear unless I was planning on raiding. If I want to raid, why the fuck would I pug when I'm in a raiding guild? Maybe your only experience is in shitty guilds where it may as well be a pug. 
---
Prebis is all spellpower mail and plate with minimal overlap with warriors and rogues, there's a '0 contest prebis' list that's currently simming at around 430 that shares 0 prebis gear with any other class, so you can fuck right off with that 'but you steal gear for half the damage of a warrior'. Highest simming and tested build shares 2 pieces with warriors, HoJ, and the +1 hit +1 crit bracers, that's it. No more. Everything else is pretty much unique to hybrid builds, and nobody runs hybrid gear or uses 2h weaponry, let alone fast 2h weaponry. 
---
This isn't 2005, dont use 2005 class knowledge. Players are better, we know more, our builds have advanced, and you are frankly behind the times on the ret build my dude.

Not as scummy as Hillary.

For example bite rank 8 only(as i remember) can be learned from wolfs in ubrs.

I was a major altaholic in vanilla, and leveled so many characters. My main was a hunter, and the other char I loved was a resto shammy. But I leveled a priest, druid, pally, warrior and rogue all to 60-70 (but never played them once they hit the level cap).   
---
I actually loved leveling the druid as I could tank/DPS or heal on my way to 60. But never tried running end game instances or raids on these other alts.
---
Priest/druid/shaman/rogue
---
- I'm keen to raid and gear up
---
- I can play a lot but not that reliably for raids
---
- Being able to PvP (just world and PuG) is very important for me
---
Rogue is my ideal for PvP but I'm nervous that unreliable schedule means I'm unlikely to get raid spots or gear up
---
Which brings me to healers... Dwarf priest is appealing and should get me easier raid slots right? But then how are healer priests in PvP? Squishy?
---
Then druid, I loved druid healing but I'm nervous that in PvP I'm just a flag carrier? But they're tankier than priests against melee right?
---
Then shamans haha... But hard to gear if there are 8 per raid?
---
Wtf is a 48 rogue doing in SFK
---
The question is simple : what are you looking for with your Pet ?
---
Most hunter want a tactical pet:
---
Ranged
---
Can root
---
Can Deny spell with a very good attack speed
---
The wolves are not bad, but some other races can perform better :)

This. The ceiling has grown ever higher while the floor is still dirty.

---
Anyone know where to get Warcraft 3? It dosent seem to be available from Blizzard ever since they announced the reforge.
---
Ain't that just classic in a nutshell &lt;3
---
Nothing strange here but how is the damage from much higher level monsters? I obviously haven't had the access to beta so I can't tell if crushing blows and so on are a thing and how hard they really hit because that might just make the difference in tanking meta. Bears might be better than warriors for generating more threat while not sacrificing that much in defence so MT bear might actually be very good
---
I'm at the point that I don't want to play at all cause I can't choose a main and I don't want to be a low level pleb rerolling all the time.
---
&gt;What am I doing with my life?
---
Not so subtly bragging about your beta access
---
The difference is that classic is a great game, while TBC at best is a mediocre one.
---
That’s some inception shit right there.
---
Been playing hunter since tbc. I love this class
---
I'm replaying Ocarina of Time, great fun! 
---
I'm also looking at finally trying Morrowind, I've played Oblivion and Skyrim but never Morrowind. People look at me as if I should be sent to the Hague so I guess I'll better try it out!
---
Thats what i meant! Not only this chat, it's the same everywhere
---
Or just Towelliee and his goons
---
It tells you, tard.
---
You are a rogue, my friend. Only downside that it's popular so there will be a big competition. Be social and you may easily overcome tze competition.
---
That TRUE Vanilla feeling ...
---
to be fair in tbc prepatch it was ALOT easier to kill naxx bosses
---
One of the reasons I quite often disable the chat while watching streams tbh.
---
I like your reply. I imagine rolling people in pvp as a femdwarf would look kind of hilarious and make quite a few opponents infuriated!
---
I normally ask myself is ther/can I see any possible/likely reason for anyone, companys included to lie if there are non or I can't see one I tend to trust the information. But maybe you can se a reason where I can't.
---
For the hardcore guilds the raid meta will be to bring as few people as possible so everyone can get as much loot as possible.
---
The casual guilds will be able to bring 30-40 people, where a decent amount will be offspec, hybrid spec or non-meta specs because T1 and T2 is going to be just that easy. 
---
WoW classic has never been about the end-game. It's about the journey.
---
Tons of people enjoyed long AV on servers like Nostalrius. It's not balanced, you may not get anything out of it but kills but it's fun to a lot of people and those people want it to remain the same.

Thanks a lot for this, doing some good work!

I've seen beta testers fight much higher level monsters and crushing blows are a thing, yes. Honestly all damage/health values i've seen in all of beta are right, which makes sense since blizz is using the original database and formulas...

Mad lad

You're operating on old assumptions, old builds, and old theorycrafting. This is 2019, not 2005. Paladin is currently simming off beta tests in the 450-525 range depending on the conditions of the pull, consume usage, and gear. With 2 consumables, Shadow Oil and Dragonbreath Chilli, Paladin can do 435 sustained indefinitely on current sims, based off beta data.
---
In the beta test, we've already calculated that ret should be upper middle of the pack in prebis and MC, and still scale pretty well through the game. Times change. So does theorycrafting. Ret was never really explored by high end players, but we have a half dozen former mythic raiders, including myself,  working on parsing it out now and have made some pretty huge breakthroughs in the last few months. Nostalgia private server fucks wouldnt touch it with a 10 foot pole, but a lot of modern raiders have shown an interest, and some are capable of creating the winning formula.
---
I played a mage in classic and BC, but switched to melee after that because i want a class that can DPS and tank because i hate fuckwhits tanking more than i like DPSing. Plus melee is more my style now.
---
Pretty much this. I don't know when/why people all the sudden think everybody burns out at the same rate. I could level ten druids to level 30 between now and launch and still be enjoying myself as long as it was in pre-Cata Azeroth.
---
I was there the day they changed it to 10-man.  The update was great.  Players were able to get their gear quicker, and the entire dungeon was always a good experience.
---
But damn if I don't miss the chaos 15-man ubrs had.  Some of my most memorable vanilla days.
---
Maybe one day we can hope for a heroic 15-man version.  I'd be down for that.  It doesn't even need to have better loot.
---
I was hoping I would recognize some of the names, you weren't in the GRS (Gnomish Rescue Squad) were you?
---
I'd have dual spec in, but keep the cost, I just hate remaking my bars after every respec.
---
That's what am thinking too, sure PvP is gonna happen, especially for limited resources (mobs, nodes) but not that much like people think.
---
Man that 10 hours of testimony and 3? 4? 5? Republican investigations of Benghazi that all said that everything that could be done, was done, must of all lied. You're the one with the truth - Hillary cackled maniacally watching those men die while sipping champagne .
---
I agree with you classic is great, but people can like both. 
---
If you look at wow subscribers over the years towards the end of TBC and the start of WOTLK, this is when wow was at its peak of around 12 million subscribers.... 
---
I wouldn't call those numbers mediocre......
---
You can do that chain during the main raid if you have a guy who has farmed the required rep in Silithus during the last few levels.
---
Ach they're probably gonna raise the beta cap and make my gear shitty
---
Good point I add one later
---
I demand they set the clocks back. Classic should not be released in 2019.
---
They were all already on the same layer, I wonder why it put them on a new one. Weird. Make sure this gets noticed.
---
The entitlement of some people lol
---
I cant get burned out from classic so speak for yourself
---
Because they don't have the highest damage. And you want that when you are kiting in pvp. They are however excellent in groups for that howl buff.
---
SOMA is a real mindfuck.

In pve the difference between a good clicker and a good keybind player is not that large for most classes. In PvP the difference is alot larger.

The average leveling speed is 10 days, the only way you get that slow is by intentionally doing stuff like spending 6 hours in world pvp during leveling. A guild going for this will be full of hardcore speedrunners who can get to 60 in 6 days IRL. Also remember you don't need 40 people who are actually level 60, you need like 20 people in greens + a tank who has farmed a couple of pieces of fire resist + another 19 people levels 55-60.
---
This is something that was super obviously broken though. No vanilla experience required to know autoshot is fucked up

Be a good snowflake and melt.

I remember that guild name in particular and the The Templar Order in your other screenshot but otherwise I can't remember much else. Nice to see you're alive and well. You're coming to the classic RP server I hope?
---
&gt; Remember when sharding was supposed to only be for the starting zones? 
---
Bad argument. Sharding in the first few zones was one of blizzards proposed solutions to the launch stress and tourists problems. They also considered dynamic spawning and server merges as possible solutions. This was back when they proposed 4 phases aswell(we have 6 now).  
---
 ***"There will never be layering after Phase 1, period."*** \~ Ion Hazzikostas   
---
I get why you are being doubtful, but the classic team has not done a great job so far. They deserve a little faith at this point.
---
Well I spent 15g+10g+1g on respecs so far in beta so...that's a thing
---
They could also turn on queues after phase 1 and offer free realm transfers off these servers. Like in the good old days.
---
Have you ever thought of a really good wank you had to a video just to be entirely incapable of finding that video again no matter how hard or long you try?
---
People say the internet doesn't forget, but that's only true for shit you want it to forget. Things you rely on staying online forever will simply vanish.
---
I honestly feel like thotbott worked better
---
Only when I by fire be purged.
---
The reason wolves were not the best, was due to their additional ability. Furious Howl was great in a raid as it helped increase the DPS. But in PVP, the chances party members are within 15 yards is pretty slim.  
---
There are other animals which can provide more usefulness in PVP. 
---
Brokentooth has a 1.0 attack speed, meaning the push back for spell casters is brilliant. 
---
Boars can stun players for 1 second....which in WSG when attacking a flag carrier, can be very useful. 
---
Scorpids can stack x5 nature damage debuffs on players which lasts even after your death.
---
The vanilla raid is easy (mechanically and maybe even numberwise) , what makes it hard is to gather the SAME players for it.
---
If you play enough and a nice guy liked in your guild, you gonna have a spot and will eventually gear up.
---
If you don't play premade BGs, you can play whatever you like, noone can tell you apart.
---
Play what you want, especially in the first few months, there will be hell a lot of guilds trying to progress and gonna need players for it.
---
Hell yea brother my mom bought me a flat screen monitor and we just upgraded to DSL, arooooo outland here I come
---
Would have been interesting to see some more options. I played only twinks really in Classic and TBC. I had a lot of 19/29 Mages, Rogues, Hunters and Druids. I think I may have gotten one of them to 40, but I basically never got to endgame or did any raiding in WoW until Wrath, where I played it about 10 hours a day for 9 months or so.
---
I imagine a lot of people also didn't hit endgame. Some might have even made it to 60 but still didn't raid. So technically I fall under "yes", but I don't really feel like I experienced most of Vanilla or any of TBC during their time or really started "playing". WoW could never pull me away from FFXI so after a few weeks I always quit WoW and went back until I FULLY quit and came over for Wrath.
---
**&lt;Hellion&gt;\[EU\]\[H\]\[PVP\] Hardcore light!**  
---
Hellion is a guild for those of us that want to clear all content at a steady pace, but in a sensible and time efficient way, and have fun while doing it!   
---
Rather than brute forcing progression by raiding insane amount of hours most days a week, we will be raiding a maximum of 3 days a week, 3 hours per raid.   
---
With such limited raiding time, we require our raiders to be of high standard and prepare for the raids both in terms of consumables, enchants and strategy. The goal is to form a tight roster of highly skilled and like minded players.  
---
It's a big plus if you have experience from raiding in vanilla, but it's not a requirement.  
---
In the end though, we all play this game to socialize and to have fun, and the goal of Hellion is to be a great place to relax after a long day of work/school. We will be running PVP premades and other fun stuff on off days.  
---
**Our requirements to be a part of the guild:**  
---
= You can level to 60 somewhat fast and commit to 3 raids a week, 3 hours per raid. Most likely Wed/Sun/Tue 20:00-23:00.   
---
= You know your class and play it well. Several top notch guides out there if you are a new player!  
---
= You know about the debuff limit and how it effects your class in raids. Info about it is usually in the top notch guides mentioned above!  
---
= You can think and act in stressfull situations and show up prepared to every raid. Strategy, consumables, pre raid bis gear and enchants.  
---
= Willingness to build a positive reputation for the guild. You represent all of us when you wear the &lt;Hellion&gt; name. Act accordingly.  
---
= You are a team orientated player, what's best for the team has priority over you. We gear the raid to progress. Be cool with a transparent loot council and realize that you will get your stuff faster if we kill stuff faster.  
---
**What we offer:**  
---
= Mature and experienced vanilla guild and raid management.  
---
= An opportunity to clear all the raids in Classic without insane commitment requirements.  
---
= We provide all information you'll ever need about your class in the class channels on our discord.  
---
= New friendships that will hopefully last a lifetime!  
---
If this resonates, visit our discord [https://discord.gg/cTxdUC9](https://discord.gg/cTxdUC9) and enter the application channel for more information.
---
You must have never played arenas at a high level if you think it’s not part of a social experience lol
---
Took me a while to realize that file size is a very obvious giveaway. Obviously not 100% safe, but definitely better than blindly downloading 2MB movies.
---
Most likely, yeah. The reason we picked the RP server was to avoid stupid nicknames and in hopes of a lore mature community. That and we liked trying to create our own guild of story even though we primarily were a guild that focused on PVE content it was nice to go in character when venturing in Azeroth :)
---
EU - Horde - PVE - Player looking for guild.
---
Friendly guy with solid experience in WOW, consider myself a good player. Would love to apply to a raiding guild, but the raiding times have to be from 8pm (7:30pm latest) UK time (so 8:30-9pm EU server time), as i dont arrive home from work before that. Sadly majority of guilds raid from 7pm UK time, meaning i physically can't make it there :(
---
I will be happy to make a proper introduction and/or apply to your guild, as long as you got friendly attitude, desire to raid and raid times that i can actually attend. Please let me know if that is your guild, and i will be more than happy to provide more info!
---
Many thanks!
---
I have always loved the tauren race and mythology. Shaman fits best with them imo. So yeah, I'll be the same as in retail.
---
TS isn't too bad tbh
---
I'm just glad Ventrillo is out of my life.
---
Ive never seen this anime so in my head stomp em in the nuts is playing
---
Wait you got auctioneer data from 14 years ago?! I guess you are not willing to share this data too, don't you?
---
This is a lot of work you did there. I am impressed! I have to start digging into a lot of databases I guess... =/
---
It is actually a direct nerf to dungeons having 1.12 talents, some of the earlier talents for certain classes were beyond bad. Doing SM in 1.02 vs 1.12 would be night and day for many classes. Same with MC, BWL and somewhat AQ.
---
Hell fury warriors, the undisputed top DPS juggernauts didn't exist until 1.6 i think, which is BWL release, and even then fury warriors didn't start popping up until late into BWL since nobody knew how good they were. Druids had to spec into innervate until 1.8, Paladin, Priest, Shaman, Mage and rogues didn't get their talents revamped until AQ and later. And the difference for many of these is HUGE. Mages don't have improved scorch which is a flat out 9% dmg increase until Naxx i think which is when they had their talents revamped.
---
EVERY CLASS was made better over the course of vanilla and the content is tuned to the items available at its release, the classes relative power and the players skill. The last one you can't do anything about, people are better players now. But the first two you can compensate for by buffing the content.
---
Still not sure what faction. Ill probably start looking for a guild and pick then.   
---
If I'm Alliance I kinda want to play Druid but I also like Paladin and it seems to be the better class. Although I'd love to run the flag in WSG but that doesn't come out straight away so maybe having the druid as an alt would be a better choice.   
---
For horde I only really like the Forsaken. I've always liked Warlocks but I really cant be bothered farming shards all the time + I kinda want the undead mount so I feel I shouldn't make a lock. I've always enjoyed priest but I heard healing doesn't give the best honor and gearing a shadow priest seems hard. Every time I've played mage I've had a shit load of fun and pve looks super easy. I tried Rogues back in the day but the slow stealth really killed it for me. Was their a talent that made it quicker? If so how much faster was it? Warrior would be cool but the leveling is slow and its probably gonna be to popular. Also I had some bad experiences tanking back in the day mostly due to having no clue how to tank and somehow every time I tried to pull a pat I'd get the other 2 groups around it as well. I did love arms though although I never used the other stances.   
---
So I'm pretty set on Alliance. Its the horde I'm having trouble picking.
---
Battle shout does give threat on classic beta, because it did in vanilla too.
---
&gt;oodfang will have roooughly 4k health. And you can expect your eviscerates alone to do 3k to him. So you "just" need to find an additional 1k, which isn't too hard, even with a level 1 d
---
You can even throw in a grenade for 300-500 of it.
---
Proving grounds was probably the best solo skill check there is in the game. People were moaning about it all over the place because it showed to them they suck at the game. WoD heroics were a pleasure in the first weeks because of this. All the baddies were filtered out.
---
It's only an issue for a few weeks after launch. They need the layers to prevent traffic jams and ragequits.
---
Do you really want to play the starter zones with a thousand other players?
---
Personally I would rather they have many servers at launch, and combine them as needed.
---
enahnce is better for lvling
---
SoJ is good, but Pendulum of Doom is better in every way. Slower, higher top end, wound procs, and if orc +5 axe skill. It's not even close.
---
I think I started around that time too. Something like mid April(EU). Didn't really bothered with the Game until a friend showed it to me. But I couldn't get a my hands on my own Copy far a while because it was sold out for a long while.
---
Good question, I’m going with orc hunter too and would like to know
---
It's all about the group composition. If your warrior, go with casters... if you're caster go with melees.
---
It's gets more difficult with 10 people, though
---
I'm literally making 2 characters at the same time and leveling them in tandem. Warlock &amp; Warrior. Herb/Tailor &amp; Mining/Skinning.
---
Show me the money.
---
At what point should I dual wield if I plan on leveling as fury? I definitely want to dual wield when I raid but from 1-59 should I just go 2H?
---
Yep it’ll be &lt;APES&gt; or the group called I wanna say... Onslaught? They were on Countdown to Classic. Basically, these people are putting a ton of planning into it, and they are not talking specifics publicly because they want to beat the competition. I think it’s about 50/50 that they get it on the first reset. It’s a real accomplishment if they do.
---
Some people get salty about this kind of stuff, but imo it takes nothing away from the game for the rest of us going at a more normal pace. To each his own.
---
The god damn forced updates fuck with my drivers. Everytime it updates I lose something. Last week it was sound, this week it was my wifi adapter.
---
After watching Preach's RFC video https://youtu.be/0wj5W42GiUE?t=1666, the ability the boss uses seems to be more of a knock-up with a very slight knock-back, which if you're standing right on the edge, could send you into the lava. The rock boss in Mara would send you back a considerable distance.
---
This video shows it to some extent, but the wall stops him from going the full distance it would have sent him.  
---
https://youtu.be/0fgKnTte270?t=6206
---
Yeah I'm torn. The more I watch good mages play classic, the more appealing they get. Do they get boring raiding? I'm a bit scared about that one button rotation. I might just have to suck it up because they seem like so much fun in every other aspect of the game.
---
I would've understood you but then you said "autistic" for no reason. Take my downvote.
---
Wow! Player names were much simpler back then! No įłłîdāñ in sight
---
Knowing the people you BG against and with is SO MUCH BETTER than live wow, where you don't care about anyone because you're never gonna see any of these people again.
---
Also The feeling of leaving a fresh AV after 5 hours, going to sleep, waking up, logging back in, queueing for AV and getting in the same one you left 10 hours ago is so fucking epic.
---
I mean that was actual PvP. People brawled for hours and the front line would push back and forth with some stealth squads trying to cap behind the lines and others gathering materials to call Ivus or the Cavalry. There was so much shit going on and it was just pure PvP battles. Nowadays the factions just ride past each other and do a PvE race. I honestly don't know what kind of person considers this garbage fun.
---
There is a youtuber called Skarm - he is an amazing Warrior Tank and Druid Tank. 
---
He also has Videos on Fury Warrior Tanking for lategame etc.
---
I think the Consensus is that druid tanking is viable but only quite late game and warrior is usually superior
---
This so much
---
When i leveled my first rogue, i followed people's advice to level in combat because it was faster. It was the most boring thing ever.
---
I respeced to subtlety at level 40 and it was a blast. Perhaps a bit slower but i enjoyed the game.
---
Definitely as weird as it sounds
---
not sure if serious
---
no guild bank m8
---
*cough* private servers *cough*
---
Thank you. Nice read. I added the discord server and gave it a look. I like the idea of spell paladin but I don't like the idea that I have to use cloth equipment Mmh also hard to read for a newcomer
---
Yea.. Seems like blizzard entertainment gonna have one of the better years just because they relaunched their games :D
---
Areas in bases with no "visible" ceiling (i.e. visible sky) was considered outdoors in vanilla (inner base, roof and path leading to it), there is no bug.
---
The fact that travel form carries on for some time is not really a bug either, its just server and client determining area changed only some seconds later after the fact. This still happens in live servers too.
---
They really should buff raids to compensate for 1.12 talents and itemization. Please please do this or people will get bored. A lot of you don't seem to understand how big of a difference some classes have it with the new talents and items.
---
Like, spellpower barely existed when people did MC in vanilla, there was like 0 blues that had it. People used their tier 0.5 sets which were terrible but was the best thing available at the time.
---
I'm happy I didn't get beta access... Will be a better experience when classic finally launches =)
---
Well people are gonna hate this one, but Death Knights rebalanced for vanilla.
---
That hellhalt Legion td though!
---
I was in a similar place. A friend of mine played WoW hardcore while I played FFXI hardcore. He would always try to entice me to come and play WoW with him, and to bribe me, he promised to run me through dungeons and give me enchants from his warlock/enchanter so I could make Twinks. 
---
It was super fun, but I never made it to 60. I always kept going back to FFXI after a couple weeks. Nothing could make me quit except FFXI itself. When I finally broke free from FFXI, I made the mistake of trying WoW again and got sucked into that shit too. I played Wrath for 9 months straight, nearly 10 hours a day. Out of the frying pan and into the fire...
---
I had the same thought myself, but the more I see posts about the cool things streamers are doing, the more I change my mind. Those beta players are experiencing things that I simply won't ever get to. The moment classic releases it's going to be about getting to 60, getting gear, raiding, farming, whatever. Not to say interesting things won't happen along the way, but I feel like the beta is really something special.
---
Fun to level is an interesting term. Rogue is fun for me to level, while others find it tedious. I can't stand the auto attacking as a ret paladin or ench shaman, and yet others can't wait for it.
---
If easy leveling makes it fun, then hunter is a good choice. Strong early, i'd say it stays decent even late. A swingtimer addon is kinda mandatory tho.
---
&gt;The latter two I remember largely because one time where Fel Reaver was kited to Shattrath.
---
Someone had a fucking ton of time on their hands
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hVbuV0hZVic0V
---
This is the lvling specc shamans use, 1h/shield and then using spells. Clearstate is also really useful
---
What is your 1-5 time?
---
Yes, 2H all the way to 60. Respec to Arms at 40 if you want a change for a bit but 2H is much better leveling as the weapons are a lot better. Go dual wield once you have good 60 weapons
---
Everyone dismissed their pets? Good... now we jump to Golemagg
---
Agreed, shapeshift: broccoli form felt awful.
---
Winning
---
Well, then I also lose the ones that interest me, i.e. my subscribed channels.
---
I bought a 40g blue neck last night but quests at 30 give gold not xp so...
---
I really liked Nagrand
---
You will have more use of shadow meld than fear ward on a PvP server (the ability will be one of your most used). Enough players will roll a dwarf, so I would not worry. Night elf has a unique playstyle in PvP that is more engaging that buffing people with fear ward (stoneform is still objectively better than shadow meld, but in my opinion shadow meld is much more fun).
---
The subtlety makes it *very* classy I must say. Nice ride!
---
However..
---
^for ^^the ^^^ALLIANCE!
---
I've mained druid since WotLK/TBC. I think it's time to try a mage this time.
---
It works fine. Demo roar reduces quite a bit of damage. Take Alch and pop defense elixers. put armor patches everywhere. Spam swipe with the crit talents.
---
I was warrior back in vanilla, but I remember having to play a cookie cutter off tank spec as would dps on bosses I wasn’t off tanking. Add to this I loved pvping as well. The cost of respecing made it unviable to simply switch pre raid so this time I’m going to play a rogue for full dpi!
---
There were good changes and bad that was a good one
---
Yeah it works great. When you press interact with target and have click to move enabled, melee classes run to the target. Sometimes the melee character keeps running and runs through so you may need to bind W or S to stop him. As long as you press interact, the melee characters face the target. Ranged characters stop at around 30 yard. Sadly, they don’t snap to face target like melee though.
---
Then find your own solution, and get out of my sight.
---
Can you stop advertising your videos on this sub?
---
I was in a very similar situation, but did end up raiding through AQ40 in the end during the summer of 2006 which was fantastic.  Most of my time I spent puging dungeons.  I'm excited to do it all again.
---
It was really awesome getting tier .5 even after getting full T1.  I preferred to wear that when we weren't in dungeons.
---
That red coloured progress bar is making me uncomfortable
---
Shamans are actually great cause you can run an ele resto hybrid for pvp and pve
---
I used to say that was why I rolled female characters. Turns out I was a chick the whole time.
---
Broken Tooth all day, baby. It's a pretty good model anyway.
---
[The only AV screenshot I could immediately find](https://i.imgur.com/wxSc2nX.jpg). Not close to 19 hours but I imagine I took this because I was sniping as many KBs as I could from poor front liners.
---
Bonepoker the Undead Rogue just popped out of nowhere and shoved his flaming hot, red dagger/mace up your Warlock teammate's ass and he's looking at you now.
---
I personally aim for that and expect to be raid ready myself, but I doubt we will have enough people that actually manage to get raid ready in time. We are mostly top &gt;1% raiders or people with experience at this level of play. 
---
Personally I think Method is going to be doing really well as they have the people and connections to be enough 60s, which is the main issue. Call me Method fan boy all you want, but they are a solid group of people dedicated enough to do the grind. They are not alone at this though. 
---
When it comes to the coordination I actually don't think it exceeds Jaina preperations at all, but Im not Scrype so I dont sit with all the info.
---
[Relevant to the topic](https://i.redd.it/avxb6sc01tm21.png)
---
You're enjoying it.
---
Doh! I was in the general area :p
---
Are you really trying to say that information on how to play optimally was not harder to find back in 2004? Back then, we didn't have 1080p youtube videos for every boss or class discords with detailed guides and spreadsheets on how to gear and use consumes for maximum dps. Hardcore theorycrafting information was in text only form, and often tucked away on obscure forums in 2004.
---
please tell me ur memeing
---
I love choosing a main and an alter to play alone without my friends when they aren't online. 
---
Anyway, this system allows the identity of each individual on the server and I think that's great. Seeing that human warrior in Stormwind, that wields the X armor or Y weapon that nobody or only a few have, is awesome. Getting those whispers asking where did you found that mount/trinket/etc.
---
I was gonna be productive today but after seeing this image, dayum. I'm gonna jump on my 30 warrior on private server
---
You can run some custom scripts. For instance, I run one that disables error sound clicking and text when spamming things like frostbolt.
---
There are already some in Classic.
---
asmongold did a reaction to a reaction of his reaction to a reaction of a reaction. That’s inception
---
Holy shit people are retarded
---
I find it really hard to believe that you had t3 you had wall of death and you didn't get an upgrade for the weapon. I mean widows remorse is 10x better for tanking and it drops from low tier naxx boss, whereas the shield you are wielding required a KT kill.
---
Tanking during leveling as a druid is great. Easy to keep aggro on multiple mobs, if you're leveling as feral (which you should) your gear will be pretty good for tanking too.
---
End game I think a druid can be fine as offtank. Someone wrote an article about it. Basically it claimed it was beneficial to bring a druid offtank to early raids because they provide 3% crit to a melee group and they require different gear than warriors, so gearing up your tanks will be easier. I'm oversimplifying here though, it was certainly more well written than that.
---
Still kinda sad they went with that version. The only true version is the one with Korrak the Bloodrager in the middle graveyard.
---
I'm pretty sure they also narrowed down AV. Didn't there use to be a PvE area on the other side of the middle battlefield? (one side Korrak and on the other side something in the mountains? I may be misremembering)
---
it's cause majority of people have no ideia what they are talking about here, it's just spergs trying to stir shit
---
I've programmed for 13 years and love the word tech.
---
depends on the fight. if you need to move &amp; turn a lot, clicking is noticably inferior. also clicking doesnt mix well with throwing grenades
---
can you say what they do ?
---
Shit i should try this. Do i need to own a copy of BFA to be able to login? I have an active sub due to the beta, but the last expansion i owned was WoD which i played for like two weeks.
---
I’m talking generally. I know you weren’t attacking him personally. I mean that there’s a lot of asmon gold bashing. Not that you’re doing it. My comment is a tangent to yours.  Sorry to confuse.
---
"fuck asmongold because his fans upload his clips to YouTube" please act a little bit more retarded
---
People in the early 2000s
---
5-6 days leveling and max 10 hours of gearing. 
---
Attunement is quick for MC.
---
Personally id suggest priest, the versatility of the class is godly. Paladins are great for single target healing and are rarely ever gonna go oom towards the later Patches of gear.
---
Haha I PvPed a lot with my guild group and would absolutely shut down enemy flag carriers with her and hunted down Rogues.  It felt like every day there would be a new real forums post bitching about me.  I loved it.  I can't wait for that community aspect to be back.
---
the hardest part about classic will be gear, its just slower to gear up, 2 pieces of loot per boss per 40 people. it takes ages to gear up. raids will be wanting people to be the optimal spec to make things easier.   
---
the other thing is the hybrids for the most part suck as DPS compared to the other DPS classes. i cant remember the raid comp but i think you need like 2-5 tanks. 8 Healers? rest DPS. Looking at the probably class balance you see( [https://www.strawpoll.me/14458288/r](https://www.strawpoll.me/14458288/r)) 2/5 priests would prob be shadow/disc, 1/3 druids and 1/3 shammy. OR you could bench them and bring like 12 warriors to mash execute.
---
Heh, I guess it's true what they say, that /r/classicwow is one of the most toxic subreddits
---
This is 100% gonna happen on whatever the streamers server ends up being
---
inb4 Halo 3 surprise launch
---
Haha this is excellent!
---
fun to level is too subjective to define, we need more info than that to make a proper call. For me, anything melee is more fun to level, but thats cause i like melee.
---
It's not supposed to be easy to read, TBH, this is the nitty gritty of the class. A lot of it is pretty dense, and there are lot of tangents. We don't really have a condensed guide, it's just a bunch of us figuring out what works and what doesn't on a mathematical level. We're huge fucking nerds.
---
How about you google "classic wow addons"
---
Noobiius Maximus, what doth it tell?  I see naught but nostalgia through my rose-tinted spectacles.
---
This is exactly how I learned too. Was brought into the game by someone who knew the game better as he played the beta too. I learned it all from sunders, shields and what exactly to use for aggro, shouts and more. Once I got 60 I started tanking MC as an off tank and learned everything else from an amazing warrior who took me under his wing. I forget his name since it was so long ago but I will never forget what he taught me.
---
No, I'm not.
---
* Beta Access is tied to having an active Subscription.
---
* An active subscription would mean me fincancially supporting the crap that is BfA.
---
* Blizzard will see my money, when they present me with a product that I want.
---
It's really simple.
---
I thought ele has amazing damage...
---
Is their problem only that they run OOM too fast?
---
Or is ele actually lacking in DPS?
---
Dude...it is a beta! Character AND progress will be deleted. You pay to play the game! You would continue paying even without beta access. And if you decide to quit, Blizzard will not care. Because you will come back. As soon as classic launches.
---
But for real...if you play wow for 15 years, you are still sad about not able to play classic before launch and being salty because people who earn their money in exchange for their privacy...there must be a lot going wrong in your life...this makes me sad =(
---
Should've been more concrete: just farm the winterspring frostsaber :P
---
Certainly true. And such an epic feeling. Some people would have played through the entire night (with their scores reflecting it) and you'd come back in and ask for a report. 
---
Of all the things, server communities were WoWs biggest loss. Knowing who everyone is, caring about your reputation, having a friendlist full of competent and nice people, having actual battleground rivalries...
---
This is one of those times mods should just start banning / removing self promo tbh. Literally adds nothing to the subreddit
---
Our plan is to just go in and 20 man everything.  It'll probably be possible.
---
urg, my life as an Australian with 400 ping in vanilla.
---
imo you should take engi as hunter, because of PvP (bombs, rocket helm etc) and PvE (goblin cable) and because of fun :-)

as second profession I'd take a gathering profession, or if you want to farm maraudon / dm then maybe enchanting (but in the beginning there won't be many people spending money on the AH)
---
[Why not both?](https://i.imgur.com/DBcUtoo.jpg)
---
Iconic Video for sure. I also liked the PvP Videos from Sorrow Hill, i dont remember the name though from the mage who made them.
---
I will play alliance again, so no shaman for me. But i am torn to play Warrior. We did non stop PvP back then for Rank 14 and one of my old Warrior friends also made a Video which not only brings me back to how we had fun 14 Years ago, but also makes me excited to play a Warrior.
---
For those who are interested in some delicious sweeping strikes kills : https://youtu.be/IP3XcsOTRQg
---
Video Quality is utter garbage though. But yeah, playing warrior with Buttheal was alot of fun for sure.
---
engineering / mining then drop mining at some point for something else or just keep mining
---
Hey idiot, why have you not came and apologized for your retarded math that you spouted off in my thread? Losere
---
Venruki has jumped me a lot of times this week. Frostmage vs gnome rogue.
---
Even with him getting the jump on me its like 50/50. I can't imagine him doing arena. I am not a good pvper.
---
u can have 2 professions
---
engineering is required
---
Beautiful warrior sir!
---
I think people mean that classes had buff/abilites unique to the class. 
---
Later, those abilities were given to other classes or pruned causing the lack uniquess
---
You sure do have hottakes+rack up those fucking downvotes... super fucking clown
---
A fuck ton of bosses are nature immune or fire immune. Ele is stuck with their thumb up their ass for about 80% of MC and BWL, but finally gets to play in AQ and Naxx. 
---
This is part of RPG elements biting a class in the ass. Boss fluff kills Ele, not its numbers. Ele sims great, it does fine on dummy tests and it's a monster in PvP, the nature of raid encounters just don't let it shine at all.
---
What exactly do you mean ? Which mechanic. Some mechanics will be fixed due to new server infrastructure and the new client
---
&gt;  Additionally it seems like objectives are weighted extremely high.
---
As they should
---
 &gt;a friend of mine goes engineering and me alchemy so we can exchange items and flasks etc.
---
That won't gain you much in terms of engineering, as most of the PvP related items engineering produces are either BoP, or require Engineering to be wear/usable.

From launch-end of wrath there was one single day I didn’t log into wow.  I’ll be fine.  (For those that are curious about the one day, my family went on vacay to Florida and it took me a day to download wow on my grandparents 2005 potato.
---
That's what people are like. Pitchforking is more fun =)
---
We got some real 1000iq folk on this sub
---
The immersion is real
---
I'm quitting my main MMO for Classic. Heck, most what I've been playing is Retail because I am so excited. If it wasn't for Classic, I wouldn't have resubbed.
---
im just but hurt i wasted a wow token and had to launch battlenet every day to check.
---
wish they used any other system so i could just not waste a token
---
im not checking anymore ill just play some other junk then the new POE league
---
I didnt sign up for the beta because im scared to delete my starting feelings. So me and my friend decided to let our life end at the full release with all the pure startingfeelings.
---
Thank you for the wallpaper
---
I love my pserver mage.  Already have as many spells as my 120 mage at level 13!
---
Wow, so meta
---
I was a human ret pally in vanilla, ill be going undead rogue in classic.
---
Saoohiron
---
Can a lvl5 disenchant lvl60 items?
---
I've been playing warframe with the boys and man it's a blast
---
No Horde AH though. Which is one of the main functions of a bank alt, to be your AH poster.
---
I mean about classes, broken ones
---
Theres a pet that can root?
---
In today's hardware, it's likely that everyone will be able to get the best of both worlds. 5+ year old hardware is running games at full settings just fine. Many people are duped into thinking differently by techtubers.
---
A friend of mine started playing on release (EU date) , and during an afertoon at his place me and my other friends asked him about the GAME, became very interested and just rushed home to beg our parents for the game. We all got a big "no" and so we had to do it the hard way: we needed to download the game illegally and play it anyways! We eventually found about private servers and joined one (which had like 20 people), leveled together until level 30-ish (note that on a private server back in 2005 the xp rates and etc where not acuratte at all, which made leveling easier) and then the server was shut down. We hoped from server to server but there were always issues and we eventually got tired of it, but not of the game, so we went to begging our parents again. Time passed and eventually 2006 came and brought my 14th birthday with it, and that was when I got the game! I got to go to the mall with my parents and buy the game AND a game time card, I was living the dream! (fun fact, I think the first gates of AQ were opened on the day that I got the game, but is was on a US server) 
---
Some of my friends had already got the game in Christmas, some quit and the one who introduced us to the game was completely hooked and invested into it.
---
Everything was fine until I decided to be incredibly stupid and start skipping class almost on a daily basis to meet with my girlfriend, play football (soccer for those on the other side of the Atlantic) and, ofc, play wow. My grades went downhill, my teachers were pissed at me, and ofc when my parents found out I was completely fucked. They beat the shit out of me and took every single thing I had from me: computer, phone, TV and even a fucking Gameboy Pocket and my Dreamcast that I didn't play on anymore for years. I could barely see my girlfriend outside of school. From that moment on my life was only going to school, going to football practice and going home to study and help with chores, etc.  And I consider myself lucky to be able to keep playing football, really, because I deserved all the shit I got and much more.
---
FF to the end of the school year and my grades were now good again, I finished 9th grade and was going to high school, but most importantly...I had wow back!! So I convinced my parents to buy me game time and went back to Azeroth, but all my friends were already 60, they were doing dungeons and some raids (mostly Ony and MC iirc) and knew a lot about the game that I didn't, even though they were always keeping me up to date, and so I had to play it almost all by myself. I even created a new char (a human rogue) and leveled it to 60 and the got some help from my friends with dungeons, crafted gear and some other stuff about the game.
---
Eventually TBC was gonna come out, we got excited about it, one of us really liked blood elves and pushed hard af for us to roll horde, which we did, and we leveled new chars from 1-60 together, which we played until Cataclysm, were we all quit the game. In 2011 I went to college and let my brother that was still finishing high school use my account until the game time would expire, but the retard sold it for 30€ to a Turkish guy, and I never saw that account again. Last year I decided to come back to the game and my brother gifted me the new acc and the bfa expac to make up for it and I am still playing, even though my friends and brother don't play anymore.
---
So yeah, my vanilla experience was barely none outside of leveling and some dungeons, never got to raid (did Onyxya once on my alliance rogue with my friends guild, but that's it, doesn't count) and I am fucking excited to ruin my life and my masters degree for Classic!
---
Started in early tbc.

World Warcraft

Chainpulling as in no mana breaks except before a boss. Having mana breaks after every pull or 2 was considered standard on this sub as of a few months ago. This sub likes to change its mind a lot as more info gets revealed about the reality of vanilla verse their old memories lmao
---
Princess at 30 sounds really scary

Hey, are TFR making a comeback for Classic? Been wondering.
---
If you look at the url up top and change the "reddit" part to "removeddit" it will show deleted comments. Not gonna post a screenshot in case that is against the rules or something since he presumably deleted it himself.
---
awesome!
---
if you give up the mana regen until 40 you'll be goofin'
---
Reforged is Warcraft III with sharper graphics and more Anime, so it looks better or worse, depending on how you look at it. They couldn't even bother to color the Humans properly; have them wear Lordaeron white instead of Azeroth blue.
---
So yeah, Not much of a fan of WCIII. WCI &amp; II is where it's at for me, baby.
---
I had alts back in the day, not a lot made it very far but it was way more fun to toy around with alts.  They felt like hobby characters
---
On private servers there's a guild going into raids with 35 warriors
---
I also missed it but whatever. When it goes live i will play it in full content quality.
---
Ever since people started their Min/Max parade about how only optimal specs work, more people have disagreed than agreed. Take that with a pinch of salt. 
---
You can do almost all raiding with PvP specs and with time all of it.
---
Thats top level right now so...
---
Not a fan of bitcoins, but that other part sounds great....
---
How about you and your friend both take engineering (one Gnomish, one Goblin) then once you have hit 300 you could both drop mining and take alchemy/herbalism? You can then feed them the herbs in exchange for pots/flasks. You can also exchange the BoE goblin/gnomish engineering items.
---
You won't need mining as once you have crafted your PVP items you'll only need iron bars for iron grenades, and these are cheap. You'll both need engineering though.
---
I'm almost positive that in order to transfer characters between accounts, all of the information has to match on both accounts. First/last name, address, phone number. It's very unlikely this happened.
---
Streamer names will be taken on every single available server the instant the servers open for it. Outside of a streamer intentionally letting you knoe which one is them, you're not going to know what to avoid.
---
It looks great, but will it work with Classic? I can see you have Victory Rush, and the model of that quillboar is updated so I'm guessing you're not in the beta?
---
Yea, I love vanilla for alts. It's also super fun to send all the sweet BoE gear you find down to your alts and feel powerful when levelling. I know you get Heirlooms in retail but they're just not satisfying like sending a blue with an enchant to your alt. You know in 2 levels you're getting that sweet, sweet upgrade and it motivates you to plow through those levels.
---
I have provided the history of the character with armory link in replies in this thread. I was using ERB and Widow's Remorse when I quit, but both have been vendored by the person who held the account after I quit.
---
I used to play THPS games quite a bit when I was younger, but these days it's just bad :(
---
Nothing official yet at least, but I've poked some of the founding members in hope that some people will play with me :)
---
Things have changed though; used to be a lazy high school student, now I'm a father of two, so it will be vastly more casual :)
---
Thanks mate.
---
What software do you sell?
---
Hunters getting “outscaled” is a PvE (endgame) thing, not a PvP thing. They don’t have a way to pump out long, drawn-out DPS, but for PvP their Burst and Utility doesn’t fall off.
---
Beastslaying was the #1 at low level!
---
Interesting. If you keep hitting it, will it act like pressing w to stop?
---
The hit boxes in Classic are larger than what people remember, so it may not be as far away as you think.
---
Very impressive, im guessing swiftness potions and alot of them were used to move around quickly. Especially the run after majordomo took like 5 mins for the slower classes. For a guild without prep i think its take 40mins to 1h to clear with the same gear. Very happy to learn this since farming mc was such a slog when you only wanted the bindings.
---
I've always wanted to role-play as a Peasant or a Peon, but it just looks so boring!
---
Well he's apparently playing shaman so it's not like they have the choice anyhow.
---
That's why I'm glad I'm playing a paladin. No one is going to ask for holy shock to get in a raid just divine favor, so you can get by with 21 points in holy and the only thing you miss out on is +5 crit.
---
It gets better.
---
Before my subscription ran out, I gathered all my characters, across all servers and factions, at the Stone Altar atop the old Troll City of [Jintha'Alor](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Jintha%27Alor) in the Hinterlands.
---
It is there that they will sacrifce themselves in a grand spell, to reverse the damage done by the broken timelines, and pool their souls back into the husk of their master long gone.
---
I'm looking forward to letting them all jump off the cliff at the back-end of the cave on the 26th of August :D
---
"#nochanges" except there are pretty big changes. New backend, graphical engine and no progressive itemization.
---
It all depends on who's playing it and raid makeup. We had different tanks for different situations in our vanilla guild. The main thing is to just play what you enjoy.
---
No,
---
most people that are mad just wants to get into the beta to be part of the streamers fun, not to play actual classic
---
I'll probably roll Mage and let that be the raider that gets most of the shit, and everything else will slowly catch up when I get time, but that is admittedly going to be months out from the Mage hitting max. The leveling alone is the real problem here, how long it takes per character, not even the lack of a collections tab.
---
No, you dont' need bfa to login. They've made it now so you don't have to buy anything except the sub to play, and the latest xpac if you don't have it.
---
Not really. I think I'm a bit to excited for classic. I really want to be in the beta but then again I just tried a private server and I hit level 4 and logged off as I feel the time investment isn't worth it if I don't get the keep the character.
---
alright bro, thanks for info
---
Ooooh. Where's the "Of" ??
---
If your a tank you’ll get plenty of good out of it in that time. It’s def worth it if you can get it for 2 or 3 hundred gold
---
I am in the sense that I feel like im missing out on this whole lvl 30 meta, and probably later 40 &amp; 50 meta. This Will never be a thing after release. Also with all the streamers on the same servers theyre is more "community" driven shenanigans going on. After the release it will all just be a race to 60 to rush through the raids.
---
Personally I can't wait to look like this but in high res.  [https://imgur.com/a/Po5xgA2](https://imgur.com/a/Po5xgA2)
---
That's what I hear whenever anyone talks about hunters. I hate hunters, my friends hate hunters, hunters hate themselves.
---
You can transfer characters to other accounts?? How is that not ripe for abuse
---
Is there flying in TBC?
---
I’m alive and well!
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\~
---
He's telling you about a *slippery slope* which can quickly come and escalate.
---
Thanks, removed fun to level part.
---
Negative.  I have beta access and have no plans of ever logging into it. Maybe if I hadn’t ever played vanilla before... but I have.  I know exactly what it is, and I have no interest in turning a game I enjoy into a job by seriously looking for bugs, etc.
---
Would rather keep things ‘fresh’ for the actual launch and not burn my excitement out on a dumb beta where my chars will be wiped anyway.
---
It is my understanding that most private servers have super quick levelling boost multipliers, so levelling healers isn't THAT hard.... could be different in retail as obviously the levelling multiplier is x1 lol.
---
The majority of players didn't even reach lvl 60. Raiding was bonus end game content for the "hardcore" (aka lot of time) players. The game was a true authentic RPG in MMO environment and it was amazing.
---
If each raiding guild had 50 active raiders for those 40 slots, it's still 1600 guilds that was activly raiding. A total of around 3000 players cleared Naxx (around 70-75 guilds) before TBC was released.
---
Here's a little sauce: https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/7860746695?page=2#36
---
Tauren or Night Elf druid... what do you guys think of the factions and why I should pick 1 over the other?
---
A human paladin with that mace and banana gear is probably more dangerous. But you need to be like the master of all ninja/thiefs to gear a shaman or paladin like that, and also need other 39 slaves that allow you to do that.
---
wasn't changed during Vanilla though.
---
I wonder if the values are just stealth nerfed in latest patches and thus mostly everyone remembers all early and later dungeons and mobs hitting harder than they now do. It's possible that players indeed were much worse then but it's still strange how systematically do many have said the values seemed off. There's private servers overtuning influence as well but something just feels off with classic if we start at the latest patch and ignore all the progress vanilla had behind scenes during those few years.
---
The talents were a mess earlier as well but I doubt it did have any effect on how hard players received damage. I mean there was no reason for raiders to run low level dungeons anymore when they were raiding already or just leveled alts as fast as possible so not that many people would have noticed that dungeons were easier then than they were previously.
---
If, and as it seems that, values are correct then I just wonder how different vanilla abs classic really are and how much it affects class balance. As I said I was wondering how viable and perhaps even optimal a bear MT would be. Threat for sure isn't a problem and how hard bosses in raids really hit in latest patch after all the nerfs. This could be a big game changer and I'm sure I'll be testing that either at beta or in live
---

My only regret was simply being a friend-class member of Shadow Remains back in the day.
---
When it mattered, SR and Succession p much had a lock on top 2 Horde guilds.
---
Ye its funny how downs streamers get access,
---
I only bought Crusader if I knew I would be using the weapon for some time.
---
Bought a Reaper from horde since noone on alliance could make it. That thing was a beast.
---
Nah, you get gnomish engi, learn all the gnomish specific items, craft them, drop engi, relearn engi, and max it as goblin.
---
This but on dal rends.
---
Wierd but, ok jerk
---
Engineering is required. No if's or but's.
---
Blacksmithing is an option due to the trinket that gives you a fear break.
---
&gt;This sub likes to change its mind a lot 
---
Well, I don't.
---
I have done a ton of UBRS runs back in the day to carry recruits through the attunements, and I cannot rememeber a single significant mana break, unless someone made a mistake like scattershot-pulling additional packs. If everyone knows what hes doing, Clasic Dungeons are neither mechanically demanding, nor hard.
---
I know that there are a lot of people crying to high heaven that Vanilla was way harder. As there are lots of people who cry its easymode at every turn. They are both wrong, and likely, neither faction actually played Vanilla.
---
Vanilla was not a mechanically hard game. It was a time consuming game, a social game and an immersive game. That is what I remember, and that is what I want.
---
Why people try to talk it into something it never was, I have no idea.
---
MC has 3 fights that pose a threat; Garr, Majordomo and Ragnaros. I could see Rag being difficult with 20 man, because you'll end up with more Sons phases.
---
It's not so much about the weapons being better, Rogues do just fine in that regard. You just lack reliable access to hit gear and will miss a LOT with your offhand, thus constantly starving yourself of rage.
---
I get the feel, reading this subreddit, that alot off people will play the "good" specs, aka mage, rogue and warrior. 
---
So the amouth of Ret paladins, Shadow Priests and Enha Shamans will be low by default, making this issue mean less.
---
Okay thank you very much!!
---
Yes, this was before they made it mandatory to link your wow account with battle.net login. You could (if I remember correctly) transfer characters to accounts with the same email/last name. Which the hacker did, according to blizz when I contacted them at the time.
---
Dang, I wish I had a collection of screen shots like this. Wow was one of my first real OC games so I only ever thought to do it when my buddy and I got our mounts.
---
Funny little game came out called dota auto chess
---
I love the NE Druid leveling experience. Super immersive and fits right in with the whole Moonglade thing.
---
Wasnt there a mosaic made from players photos too?
---
You used to be able to see all the way back to your first subscription in your account page, but the recent account settings web page overhaul only tracks as far back as 2012 now =(
---
Wrath ruined wow... it added the group finder ...
---
While that is true, there were a lot of people going on and on and on about how vanilla's difficulty was soul crushing and how the "noobs" would be crying in the streets while the "veterans" were dancing, and these poop-flinging simians dogpiled and shouted down anything to the contrary.  These same people seem to be the ones whining how their faulty memory or, worse, private server experience is right and Blizzard's factual data is somehow wrong since they "remember" Vanilla being harder.
---
If not for those loudmouth people who dogpiled any dissenting opinion, we might have gotten a remastered vanilla that kept the values everyone wants to come back.
---
The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Kazzak bros for life.

I get the feel, reading this subreddit, that alot off people will play the "good" specs, aka mage, rogue and warrior.
---
You *used* to be able to Q into AV as a 40 man raid group, but it got changed. Not sure when, though.
---
There was an addon to queue as 40 the next day
---
In retail, every class has every ability or a facsimile of (stun, interrupt, aoe, self heal, movement buff etc). In vanilla, those abilities define a class. Every class has a secondary resource in retail. In vanilla, it's only rogues. It's part of what makes them unique
---
 Gameplay is simple in classic for a lot of classes and there's no real rotation except rogues but I think a lot of people prefer having more time between button presses than the ADHD gameplay of retail where you're always pressing something. The decisions in classic are based more on resource management than a rotation.
---
In classic, when you press a button, something meaningful happens. As for warlocks and mages, it's only in raiding they're the same. If you're soloing or 5 manning on a lock you can use your myriad other DoTs etc.
---
At the end of the day, a rotation from retail is essentially pressing the same X buttons in the same order over and over. What's the difference between pressing one button over and over? If something is tedious and repetitive, I'd rather it be simple so I can't think about other stuff, look around etc
---
Or maybe because it's a really fun spec?! It may not be the best spec but sure as hell is fun.

Wolves cant learn claw.
---
Cats can learn both claw and bite.
---
But serpents, they can learn lightning bolt which is BiS for PvP against armor classes.
---
So cat for casters, serpent for armor targets, boar for dueling.
---
They don't level doing single target stuff.
---
Princess herself, if your group isn’t over level melee need to get out of the area damage and bandage. Goblin guy has a simple cone area damage thing, need to keep melee attacking from behind. Hydras knock you back and patrol, very easy to get a party member knocked into another trash mob if you aren’t playing it correctly. Trash dinosaur packs with area silence abilities, which makes taunting impossible and can cause a wipe if the healer doesn’t properly range them and gets silenced.
---
It’s all easy to deal with if you understand the mechanics and play correctly, but if you ignore them and don’t outlevel/out gear the place you will wipe.
---
Stress test #1 of World of Warcraft Classic is in the books and the Countdown To Classic listeners are here to regale you with their tales of the experience.
---
After hearing all about C’Thun &amp; Hogger messing with people (that is if they even got in at all!), the show then brings you a one on one chat with a beloved Classic content creator, Frostadamus.  Frost chats all about himself, grinding/farming, the economy, and the AH in a great intimate chat.
---
Following that, the show goes off piste slightly, as a bunch of listeners call in to discuss a topic that has everyone talking lately, Game of Thrones! Why the hell is GoT being discussed on a WoW Classic podcast?!? Well, the crew highlights the parallels between GoT and WoW, the references in game, and also can’t help but touch on some thoughts regarding Season 8 and the finale (FULL SPOILER WARNING!).
---
Finally, we touch on a quick call regarding a caution to those Classic fans who are going through school when the game launches (given that release date!), and reminding everyone to keep their eye on the prize that is real life while enjoying WoW Classic in moderation.
---
Highlights Below:
---
Calling Countdown #1 – Stress Test w/ Batlord, Corry, Linkson, Paul, and Sonosuke 
---
Calling Countdown #2 – Grinding &amp; The Economy w/ Frostadamus 
---
Calling Countdown #3 – GoT/WoW Parallels w/ Feydark, Michaelbolt, Myph, Surnami, and TianSG 
---
Calling Countdown #4 – WoW &amp; School w/ Turner

Time stamps coming very soon!
---
Horde is more PvP focused and generally more hardcore. Alliance is more PvE focused and more friendly. I think Alliance has better capital cities, otherwise it's not that big of a difference.
---
Classes will be identical to patch 1.12. They will all feel different from each other and have their specific uses, which is a welcome change from retail.
---
You know OP means overpowered? Them being just useful surely means they are nice and balanced...
---
&gt;Part of the beauty of Classic WoW was the community. I spent a lot of time in Ironforge inspecting peoples gear, seeing who was who on the server, aspiring to one day be a great player who others would admire.
---
And of course playing "Ring-Around-The-Rosie" with dozens of follow-chained up mounts in Ironforge :D
---
Thanks for this post, really great screens, really nice read!
---
We are still talking about 1.12.1 when some ppl started leveling with 1.0 or 1.1 which means a lot classes and buggs got fixed till than. The only thing which effected the patch will be Naxx and maybe AQ40. But besides that it will be easy to level and to quest for the most part. But still doesn't effect the gameplay the onlything I'm kinda interessted is how the Classes really doing. I can believe that P-Server are totally wrong with classes and specs : DPS/Healing/Tanking. This could turn out that some classes might be better than we think. But still I will play it and I will enjoy it I dont care if the Mobs hit for 120 or 160. I jsut wanna play a game I enjoy and the slow-grind and not getting gear thrown in the face is what I mostly enjoy and hope they will bring more Content to Classic-WoW or just release TBC. And if TBC will be released with Pre-Nerf shit will be so hard!
---
Don't you need the hands of the enemy quest too? Those snakes don't always drop hands. I remember us needing a few weeks
---
I can never get tired of leveling a warrior
---
Mage is godly in PvP and probably among the best classes for casuals.
---
And what exactly in this part of your post has to do with my first point ?
---
This system already existed in Vanilla : kalimdor and eastern kingdoms were two different instances of the world, just like Outland. You just use a portal instead of a boat but the end point is still the same. Such immersion, much wow !
---
About the capital it is a bad example because i was asking for high level caracter in leveling zone, kinda like seeing a lvl 70 on BC running around in Azeroth. The point was that expansions didn't start this "high level caracters aren't playing in the old World" concept, vanilla did. High level being in capitals have nothing to do with this analogy.
---
If you have any expansion design different offering less downsides than the current one, go on ! Only adding new content without any kind of caracter progression nor gear upgrades won't last long. People will look for the easiest and fastest and be done with it. Might solve some balance issue but it won't ever be as attractive as a new raid tier.
---
If you offer Gear progression without any kind of reset, how long do you plan to go ? You only have so many dodge hit and crit % and at some point it becomes meaningless.
---
I'm just waiting for the game to come out to play it and hopefully it's good. I find it weird and boring to watch others play a game.
---
Meh... it’s typically a good idea for a bank alt to have AH access.  But I guess it’s not the end of the world if not.
---
I like 1 for that WC3 look.
---
Didnt Wildheart get its appearance changed in like 1.3? Those look like the post-update art and i cant fathom a server didnt have its first UBRS clear untill after 1.3
---
I want the beta.
---
Do you know what a direct nerf is?
---
Definitely will get once the hunter portion is tacked on, good work!
---
Both races feel "nature-like" but Nightelfs feel even more "nature-like" with the night elf zones with all those trees and forests and stuff. especially in ur cat form u feel like a part of a dark forest. I LOVE that feeling.
---
But for more useful stuff, it depends on what u wanna do. Why do u like alliance/Horde more than the other? are u PvP or PvE focussed or both? what spec do u wanna play?
---
Wtf lol
---
A lot of guilds will probably let you raid as a 30/0/21 Shaman, at least until AQ40 probably. It's a PvP spec that does fine healing on raids, but you lose out on manatide and improved weapon totems.
---
Not found
---
Easiest is beign a protection warrior and a group leader, so you can form a group without any plate wielders except you.
---
Hi, /u/sekksipanda
---
Of course some fresh 60 tank can't do this. You literally asked him to post a dps tank and, once posted, moved the field goal by saying it had to be a lesser geared tank.
---
Did that retarded retort make any sense in your head when you were typing it?
---
Horde gets [Thrall's Resolve](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12544) which is a great ring for feral tanks, means you don't need to think about competing with warriors for Heavy Dark Iron Ring. While Thrall's Resolve isn't technically BiS, it's actually close enough that you can wear it as long as you want and not feel like you have crap rings. The actual BiS rings aren't that much better than Ring of Protection and Thrall's Resolve.
---
I'll be rolling a female dwarf priest for the lolz.
---
Yeah but essentially that's what everybody who really played on private servers always said. Yes maybe the values are not completely right, yes maybe thing will be easier maybe some things harder who knows. But It will not make a difference because we know everything and the mechanics are the same. Some change in values are not going to change these things.
---
That does not mean that classic can't be challenger for a causal group.
---
Also, heirlooms are bad for alts. It gives you a BiS in most slots for leveling, and makes the process boring because you kill everything easily and never get any upgrades from quest rewards.
---
5-man cap
---
They were for a period of time before Lupos nerf. But classic patch is after Lupos nerf, so no need to think about that.
---
Enjoying it apparently.
---
This is only P-Server balance. We don't know if Classes and Specs and Talents are trully 100% BlizzLike or fixed but maybe the Meta will shift in a different direction because we dont know how classes turn out to be in end-game. And saying: Well 15 years ago they played that Meta they will still play it is a lie because ppl got so much better in MIn-Maxing Gear to top DPS even with Hybrid-Classes a Raid on farm makes it possible. Look at the Feral at BWL. He does so much damage and goes crazy since he can use his Debuff on the boss
---
Many other things can be wrong, your evidence has just as many holes as a swiss cheese
---
Could be you are correct, but I can't understand why I would take this picture unless it was the first clear. Besides, I'm sure these are all some of the 30-40 first people to hit level 60 on Argent Dawn.
---
Can do some research.
---
you said it. 
---
I don't know what was wrong with me
---
Im planning on going warrior because in vanilla i played a priest and I kinda want to see the game from "the other side". What im worried about though is that ive read engineering is absolutely mandatory for a tank. Why is that? How big is the advantage? Can i get by without engi?
---
If its mandatory thats kind of a dealbreaker for me, i really want to pick herb+alch because i find herbing relaxing and is one of my favorite things to do late at night when im to tired to run dungeons. This was also how i was planning to fund my repairs.
---
Also, is human a big advantage over night elf? Ive always enjoyed the look of nelf females in plate and I love the original teldrassil. Shadow eld is also bis for parentes that have to afk randomly to take care of the kids.
---
I will both raid and pvp.
---
Play Path of Exile (new league starting soon) :))
---
I’m not a streamer.  I’m just a casual Joe who has played WoW since day 1.  
---
I think we’re maybe reading a bit too much into the secretive beta selection process.  It may just be some bad luck.   Majority of testers aren’t streamers, I’d bet.  Sure some of them are and they’re helping put the game at the very top of Twitch.
---
I've been using a few different databases in the beta because none of them are really complete. My favorite thing is the 2005 comments from thott bot that are on wowhead entries. They've been super useful in finding quest items and mobs. Nobody had coordinates back then so it's all detailed descriptions of what road to take how far and what point to turn at. They almost entirely got me through ashenvale, wherein I couldn't find anything on my own.
---
In retail, I'm still playing the night elf warrior that I made in vanilla. So I will be making night elf warrior in classic too.
---
Wall of text crits you for 12439785427985279878107013570153791539715135316.
---
Its really not unfriendly if you have exp with leveling in. Vanilla. Having the gold to purchase bis or close to bis leveling items for your alts really trivializes alot of 1-60. 
---
On my last p server run id twink out my hunter (not full blown but basic enchants and good gear at 19,29,39 etc... leveling was an absolute joke. Think i clocked in around 7 days 14 hours literally just grinding and questing nonstop. Maybe a months irl time
---
that is incorrect.
---
To add on this I think it's very important that not everything is accessible to everyone. When I played vanilla I knew I would never see certain things because lack of time investment ( or to say it better as a kid I spent a lot of time into the game but couldn't make commitments to a regular group)
---
But that was a big part of the fun. Seeing somebody with certain gear and feeling exited about that gear and knowing which content they had to clear in order to achieve that. Now everybody can just go everywhere which imho sucks
---
lmao, i've spent a lot of time with ret theorycrafting, there's a lot to say and a lot of it isn't widely known.
---
It's really not that much my friend.
---
Anyone got the clip from Ziqo or chances perspective? Or weren’t they streaming
---
it still blows my mind that they removed First Aid in BoA. - ' **Battle for Azeroth** will **remove** the **First Aid** profession. World of Warcraft's forthcoming expansion, **Battle for Azeroth**, will **remove First Aid**  – a profession that's been in the game since its vanilla version in  2004, and has supported countless solo players through countless  adventures.'

---
^ he helped a lot understanding tanking. Really awsome videos
---
lol, no ... I should look that up some time  :D
---
Same problem but i will still play dwarf.
---
I wont play Nelf and make ppl think i have brain dmg. Other then that sure if you can life with ppl thinking there is something wrong with you and only play pve.
---
While Fear Ward is nice its not the biggest thing for me.
---
The Instand Heal is way to good just to pass up, sure it cant compare to the stuff horde gets but what can you do.
---
And ppl forget Stoneform, its just so amazing you get get out of Blind and be Immun to poisen for 8 sec, its just so powerful, its allmost like Blind dos not exist against you. And you can use it to get rid of these pesky hunter poisen if you have to.
---
It can get rid of bleeds and disease too, and that can still be helpful.
---
While i like nightelf i would just rage over myself picking it for Priest, or any other class then Hunter/Druid for that matter.
---
And anyone that wants to tell you it wont make a considerable diffrence if you pvp is just lieing to you.
---
Can definitely tell you don't deal with the average consumer. "Tech" guys have to explain shit in simpler terms for people, so being a "Tech" person means they are probably capable of that. It's not a bad thing because there's no point doing a detailed description when it's not required. 
---
Programming works the same way, you want shit to take less time and be less redundant.
---
Why'd you want to try to dual wield a Main-Hand weapon?
---
Interesting. Thanks for the link.
---
I guess that subjective memory can play tricks on us. As in, if you were raiding and mostly interacted with people who were doing the same, you started to get the feeling that everyone was doing it.
---
I am playing horde mage and I'm trying to decide between troll and undead. 
---
I do plan to PvP (but not exclusively) and I know WotF is good but the question is how good? Is it important enough that it would be stupid not to go UD even if I kind of prefer not being the same race as everyone else and I really dig the raptor mount?
---
Nope, i know im just a nobody.
---
&gt; With 2 consumables, Shadow Oil and Dragonbreath Chilli, Paladin can do 435 sustained indefinitely in prebis on current sims, based off beta data.
---
Based off beta data...which is lvl 30 capped? Great. How much does a rogue do with same consumables and "simms"? 900?
---
&gt; Nostalgia private server fucks wouldnt touch it with a 10 foot pole, but a lot of modern raiders have shown an interest, and some are capable of creating the winning formula.
---
Community counts for a lot in this game but let's not pretend most players would pick the ret having a better choice and let's not pretend the ret does competitive DPS compared to a similar pure DPS class.
---
Buy my gold from my bots fam
---
6 has the pleasant hue of a chunky, crusty lump of mucus. Strikes fear into the hearts of the Alliance.
---
Only slightly off topic but I would kill to have Bloodlust in vanilla. I don't even want the TBC version. I just want to be able to make one of my Hordebros huge while it makes the iconic sound effect.
---
UBRS is a 10man dungeon, and because it shares the same entrance with LBRS, you can 10man LBRS.
---
All the others are capped at 5.
---
Read his post again then read mine again, then assess whether your comprehension of my post is accurate.
---
As for obscure forums, Tigole pmed me on the old Fires of Heaven boards to find out how we bug killed Lucifron, so these boards were hardly "obscure"
---
I mean ffs both Tigole, Furor and others were hired from various everquest guilds so yeah, we didn't have Reddit but we did have hardcore mmo forums
---
I might be set already on Druid for going Feral(3rd/4th tank + DPS) in raids but still got the question, how do Druids do in World PvP when solo? Are they hard to play?
---
Its not funny, its a smart business decision.
---
I am a little. 
---
I'm still not 100% sure what class I want to play and the beta would of helped me figure that out also I feel like anyone with beta access will be faster at leveling when classic launches because they will already know the 1-30 route for leveling.
---
What spec has the biggest crits? Damage or healing.
---
Don't let it discourage you. There are plenty of other options out there. I just didn't wanna add a long list of 2-4 items per slot.
---
I appreciate your long post but I'll take the blizzard developers word that it's a possibility and hold out hope!
---
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://wccftech.com/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-tbc-wotlk/amp/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjZiOyAz8DiAhVPDq0KHY7sCogQFjAAegQIAxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw29t88Yqku8YbomJ49nr6OR&amp;ampcf=1
---
I’m looking forward to having shit to do on each toon. Farming and raids for my mains, as well as 60 WPVP. Meanwhile, I can have alts at lower levels, just to do the occasional dungeon or gank spree. There’s so much to do, and almost every class has something that makes me want to play it. It’s fine that some won’t make it to 60.
---
It's one handed. Sorry you didn't play vanilla.
---
Blizzard did an official one many years ago, yeah. I'm in it somewhere! :D
---
That's the spirit. Good luck!
---
i believe why engineering is so used is for the [force reactive disk](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18168) shield, it gives you some good aoe threat generation afaik.
---
if youre talking casual tanking in dungeons, no its not required, but in raids probably yes. there are only really 2 slots for tanks in a raid and since they take 90% of the damage they will be required to have to min/max or else they will get cut for a more willing tank.
---
nelf has dodge which is nice but a double-edged sword because you dont get rage from dodging and hence less threat generation. that being said you could totally make a nelf work, it's only a few % points difference.
---
Engineering is not at all mandatory for a tank. It gives you some good extra threat utility with the bombs.. but that's about it. Back in original vanilla I was a MT for my guild doing server first progression raiding all the way till AQ. Wasn't an issue. I was an idiotic weaponsmith. Arcanite reaper hoo.
---
PvP at a high level I'd say engineering is a must on nearly any class. The extra stuns and utility is just too good to pass up, and you'll be in a disadvantage without it for sure.. 
---
However herb and alch is good money. And at the end of the day PvP is not about how much you win, but how much you play ^^
---
Too many things to list out. Quest helpers, UI changes, auto gray item sellers, whisper filters, dot timers, minimap, bag mods, etc.
---
I’m sorry but can someone please explain to me why this is useful? I played all of vanilla without an addon like this. Not hating just curious.
---
Tbf a lot of people, but we thought it would be a new mmo not an old one. After the 2nd or 3rd unsuccessful new mmo that released " only wow can kill wow" was the consensus.  They've done it in more ways than 1. Wow sucks and they are releasing a new old mom. Go figure lol
---
I want to play an ele sham for classic, can anyone tell me pros/cons for pve and pvp?
---
Just checked now looks nice addition to help you in the jurney
---
I have no shame in admitting that I was a keyboard turning clicker! I did surprisingly well in PvP considering just how bad I was. Some other noob things i did/thought were:
---
Thinking I could only have the one character. 
---
Being scared of using the AH. 
---
Thinking that any armour I had had to match the aesthetics of a paladin, anything that didn't look right got sold.
---
Having no concept of Tank/Healer/DPS in dungeons. 
---
Luckily for me I had some very patient guildies!
---
No it didn't. It promoted flavor of the month, because everyone got gimped in burst damage. Arena is also terrible PvP compared to Open World or Battleground PvP.
---
For me he is literally unwatchable until he either stops vaping or mutes his god damn mic every time he vapes. 
---
Doesn't bother me people vaping IRL but hearing it through the headset is just triggering.
---
I wouldnt use classicdb as its plain wrong on so many items. Look up [Soulstring](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22811) or [Fine Light Crossbow](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15808) on classicdb for example and compare it to the ingame version or to wowheads database for classic ([actual Soulstring)](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22811/soulstring).  Give WoWhead time to gather data and use adblock to make the site more enjoyable. Protip: Never rely on pserver data ever.
---
The pserver I"m playing on had peak online population \~11000 this weekend. Obviously, a lot of people are curious about the vanilla experience right now.
---
I have multiple 60's on a couple servers I have played on, but I plan on taking a couple months to de-compress.
---
1.3 was released on March 7th in EU and the EU WoW release was 11th of February. Being an RP server and UBRS being one of the later dungeons we did, it's most likely the first clear, or at least one of the first. Took a while before we could gather 15 people with enough gear at that time.
---
Improved weapon totems are 100% useless, the math has been done  a million times. Rest you said is true ofcourse.
---
Get level 10 and use [Bag of Marbles](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1191) from Goldshire, should be ok with a heal/heal pot in the middle of the fight.
---
I'd say the difference there is that he attracts his audience with a hook *other* than solely his value as an entertainer. That being World of Warcraft, overexposure to his specific content matters less imo because his primary source of content is constantly changing over time. People don't just tune in to watch Asmon, they tune in to watch what he is doing as well. 
---
As long as he has videos to engage with and content to play within his sphere then he should be able to sustain indefinitely because his 'gimmick' doesn't lose its appeal over time since he is almost more of a conduit or vehicle for the other stuff. He adds to it and has enough charisma and personality to carry a stream by himself but I think that's why his reaction videos are so popular.
---
This hurts to read, and that’s why the human brain doesn’t finish its development until your mid 20s, for some of us, probably never 😁
---
wotf is nice in both pvp and pve because bosses that fear can be broken with wotf for extra dps time.
---
that being said, pick based on aesthetics. unless you want to go balls to the wall min/max hardcore, it's not worth looking at an ugly char.
---
If you want to make extra money while levelling, Skinning.
---
If you want to be the most useful you can be at lvl 60, Mining and Eng. Engi is BiS (lol) for Hunters because its how you get the best ammo in the game. Also, FD + Jumper Cables = a happy party.
---
Any chance you could add a reverse bar option? The bar filling up does not seem natural to me, I'd rather have it un-fill, else it looks like a cast... I'd prefer being a countdown to being able to shoot, makes more sense to me, just in case it can be done without too much trouble!
---
That’s a good thing. People are excited to play classic, and the more people talking about it, whether it be nostalgia, what they’d like changed, or whatever, is nothing but a positive sign. The only really bad posts are the”OmG ClAsSiC wILL FaIL” ones.
---
Remember. Blizzard has committed to 1.12, so as many  discussions about “what happens after Naxx?” Or “Should we get guild banks?” as you see, only means people are thinking about and engaged with this product. Classic wouldn’t be happening if there wasn’t buzz around it. Blizzard has committed to a faithful representation of the game you loved in the misty days of 2004. 
---
New people with new ideas are going to be playing....that’s a good thing. Welcome them, even if their ideas are different from what you want, and trust Blizzard to remain true in their representation of the game they promised. Make sure your voice is heard, too, because what the enthusiasts want is every bit as important as the newcomers!!
---
Madseason has started streaming on twitch too :D
---
You didn’t have Ice Lance in Vanilla
---
Nope
---
they arent particulalry hard to play, as long as you are aware of your spells within different shapeshifts. usually druids play the wittle-down playstyle of using insect swarm and moonfire and simply outlasting opponents in bear form, as well as ocasionally popping out to heal, etc.
---
aesthetics / people talk about gear and bis like you have unlimited access to every piece of gear when chances are if you want it 6+ other people want it too.
---
especially paladin's where a lot of the bis is cloth , yeah im sure none of the cloth healers/casters will mind paladins taking their shit first.
---
judgement is prob the best example of this because it has STR which is a dead stat for paladins
---

obviously paladins cant wear the prest tier but just using it as a comparison because i cbf adding up random cloth pieces
---
the paladin set bonus has a decent chunk of spell power and priest has a renew effect on greater heals which im sure is great unless they dont stack (not familar with it)
---
the main dead stat is strength on the paladin set , it does not have much spirit but paladins dont stack spirit
---
honestly i dont think its a game breaking loss if you wear at least 5 piece t2 for the set bonus spell power , after that if you feel like it wear good cloth pieces
---
No thanks, I don't like missing out on half of the game.
---
Funny story, one server buffed the boss damage values so people would complain that other servers made the bosses too easy despite using proper values. Had a few good discussions with those people. Seems like it worked.
---
Humans descended from Vrykul, but they are Humans. They’re not Human because they’re Humanoid or every race would be Human. They’re Human because they’re Human beings like us. Dwarves and Gnomes are not Humans, neither are Orcs or Trolls. Humanoid? Yes. Human? No.
---
Same thing for shamans with earthbind totem
---
He did report it a couple of minutes later.
---
It’s not that difficult to gear because majority of mail that drops is passed, and you don’t bring a whole lot of hunters to raid either.
---
no
---
Was a Warlock in vanilla, and a Warrior from TBC to WotLK.
---
I'm gonna heal this time. Probably either Druid or Priest. Undecided, but leaning toward Druid
---
This sub is slowly evolving into facebook
---
I really don’t understand the obsession with the beta, and especially stress tests. I want to play the game more than the next guy, but wtf is the point playing a limited version that’s gonna get wiped in 3 months.
---
Only exception I can see is wanting to try out classes briefly if you’re not sure yet what to roll, but it seems the majority want to treat it like a legit character on a legit server.
---
- [MCCC - MC Command Center](https://deaderpool-mccc.com/#/Top) - Allows you to configure all kinds of stuff about the game, but also runs "story progression" in the background which will marry unplayed Sims, move Sims into their own homes, have Sims give birth, etc. so the game doesn't get stale.
---
- [WickedWhims](https://wickedwhimsmod.com/) - The (in)famous "sex mod."  Gives more options for "Woohoo" but you can also download animations so "Woohoo" isn't just two Sims wrestling under covers.  But if you don't tune down the autonomy in the settings, be prepared for a town to devolve into debauchery.
---
- [Extreme Violence](https://www.sacrificialmods.com/downloads.html) - Allows your Sim to punch, slap, or even straight up murder other Sims.  If there's witnesses, your Sim gets a bad reputation over time and other people curse or might even try to kill them on sight.  There's also a chance for police to show up and lock up your Sim.  (Bonus on that site: Life's Drama.  You can turn it on with a Sim to cause random events to spawn around them, like a runaway bride, dating Sims, lost toddler, a Sim on fire, etc.)
---
- [Basemental](https://basementalcc.com/) - Drugs mod.  Your Sims can buy and sell (and of course use) drugs, and even grow their own pot.
---
There's a lot of other mods out there.  Of the above, MCCC's the one mod I consider a "must-have" since otherwise the game's default behavior is for unplayed Sims to just grow old and die in the home they were assigned, so there's no generations or anything.  The others can be used to make the game either "more realistic" or just go down a rabbit hole of sex, drugs, and violence.
---
Yeah but they get outscaled in terms of what % of HP they can do in that first 8-10 seconds. Yeah they can still nuke and are a nightmare in the open world but full T3 BiS they aren’t as much of a threat for let’s say pre-raid BiS. 
---
Pre-raid gear they can aimed shot you for like 50+% of your health bar. At full BiS maybe only like 30-40.
---
I think its fun in big events like csgo matches, but when watching a single streamer, its more often unbearable than not imo.
---
So will be the ret tho. Neither of those, outside of luck, will be so because of their great damage, but rather because of what they bring to the group.
---
Aesthetics without a doubt.
---
Wooooord. You're my effing hero. I'm gonna try this out. Dude, that's amazing. I cannot wait to try it out this evening!
---
Just as an aside, I just subscribed again for the first time since Cata (thirsty for dat beta) and dicked around for a bit. I had to update an old macro that no longer worked and god damn there's a lot of icons in the game! I mean there were already shitloads of them from the start, but it's just ridiculous now. Must be a couple thousand at least.
---
Then please do link the patch that changed it.
---
Yeah, I raided a lot and some friends did. But the majority of my friends actually didn't. So it felt like atleast half of the population raided at 60. I was quite shocked when they said only a few % even reached 60.
---
Think I started around the end of BC on a friend's account, then later I got my own account to play fully on WotLK, was great! I still remember watching a friend play on Vanilla though, but definitely didn't touch the HL content there! The journey has always been the best part for me, except in Wrath where the endgame was real cool
---
Wow you're wrong and a dickhead.
---
Soda is absolutely having a blast playing classic, never seen the dude as happy as he's been since beta came out.
---
I sucked big time.
---
I love how everyone is trying to prove you wrong. You're absolutely right.
---
WoW always had the issue of content irrelevancy. 
---
People want content should be released the Runescape way, every time you release new areas there's stuff for every level to do there. Look at region locked ironman challenges. There's so much stuff to do starting from level 1 all the way to endgame in one region. That's what we want in WoW.
---
Autism usage gets downvoted, didnt even read after that
---
&gt; "Tech" guys have to explain shit in simpler terms for people, so being a "Tech" person means they are probably capable of that.
---
People who are generally knowledgeable of predetermined  issues and are going to have no real understanding of how the technology actually works. I have however met a handful of IT workers who are absolutely brilliant and their hourly runs $300  for trouble shooting outrageously unlikely issues and its absolutely worth it. I would have an easier time explaining how my software actually works  to my civil engineer father who quite literally doesn't use computers at all than I would to your average SYS admin. These people memorize the output of a series of routine operations of a system with out needing to understand the logic or reasoning behind them to any significant degree.
---
You had a pretty nice setup back then!
---
Bubble hearth.
---
If you drop gnomish, then everything that requires gnomish is unuseable.
---
No. I played during retail vanilla (I started just before AQ), and as excited as I am to re live those days, I don't want to spoil myself before launch.
---
I've been taking the time to do things around the house like clean the garage out completely, get some work related things out of the way etc before launch so I can completely indulge.
---
If I got beta, I wouldn't even use it.
---
Wow, as a 2004-06 vanilla player, this is fascinsting to hear. I hope other suboptimal specs find stuff that works. I'd love to be part of a "memespec" that actually does well
---
Drizzle more like for 40 people lol
---
Such douche baggery, may seem to non vanilla players like it would suck to experience. And while it definitely would suck at first, what it would lead to was a fight with the other faction over the boss kill. And that become such memorable and fun moments.
---
Out of all the responses this one made me a little sad, I hope you at least spent some time with your grandparents.
---
Wait are they putting code in the water that's turning the pservers into retail?
---
I would be very hesitant to ever say a hunter “falls off” in PvP because that’s a function of better Stamina gear which affects everyone
---
I could very well be remembering wrong, but I think I've read somewhere that you lose skill on beta
---
Aoe leveling can be fun, need a mage to do that.
---
You’re also a tard, it says 2004.
---
Afaik, you can't freeze your XP in classic? I could be wrong but I remember them adding xp freeze to twinks at a later time?
---
Afaik it is a cap of 10,but quests will only be doable with 5 peeps.
---
As long as you out gear people you will be okay, just not great.
---
Everyone ends up there, everything to please the algorithm, i blame youtube more than anything. Back in the day I used to watch a guy called Foxdrop because he made very informative and fun videos about interactions and shit in the Jungle in league of legends. Havn't thought about the guy in years but yesterday a video of his popped up on my youtube recommended and the title was "YOU CAN'T LOSE IF YOU RUN THIS....", everyone has to do it because Youtube is a garbage platform but it does kill you little inside to see.
---
Leave behind expressions like Toon in retail, they don't belong in classic. Thank you.
---
Not in vanilla.
---
Take it up with blizz, it is their lore
---
Not much is wrong, and people with beta access that played during vanilla confirm that. The only thing that strikes as very different is elite mob difficulty and it indeed is not challenging enough but not because blizz got it wrong. Its caused mainly cause of player skill and knowledge (the biggest one), stable high game fps and good connection with low delay. Itemization doesn't play much of a role when a Boss in RFK deals &lt;100 damage to a naked player. I am talking about Agathelos btw, there is a video of a druid with 0 armor taking like 65 damage from him...
---
The only argument you can make is that classes received many buffs thought the patches and coupled with low player skill the dungeons were tougher but that is just early vanilla...
---
Good point. However, one youtuber said that classic wow is actuallt better compared to the retail because even when classic has less features, they are all meaningful. In retail you can become a demigod and solo all kimds of stuff while it doesn't mean anything. The crucial point was that in classic wow you are experiencing and creating these adventures instead of these heavily scripted / phased events which won't mean anything.
---
This had a legit problem in it. So just [chill out dawg, you know you ma booiiiiiii, this ain't be what it looks like, 'aight?](https://youtu.be/Y-mHXD-caQA?t=68)
---
Not in classic, best you can get is boars charge f oh r a "root"
---
there isn't a thing called noob anymore, entire guides, services, fastest level route, add-ons and etc, are literally just a click away.
---
Rag is locked behind a rep grind. Good luck with that on week 1.
---
The video is speeded up by 33%.
---
So I am really torn at the moment. I will basically only play pve and I am struggling to decide if I wanna play a mage or a spriest. 
---
From what I have read most raids will only take one spriest, I will play hybrid and so on. Is this just high-end talking or will I be perfectly fine playing "pure" shadow? I do not mind healing I actually loved holy priest in MoP-Legion but from my experience once you offer to heal once youll do it always
---
No "of" really kills this
---
Might be a bug then, but it was changed in the vanilla.
---
Buy the reforged version and you get the normal version
---
In my experience, items on AH start out very cheap, since noone can afford anything in the beginning. I plan to use auction house addons yo track prices from launch and out. Might provide some interesting insight into the evolution of the server economy.
---
Wow talk about revisionist history, lol.
---
We went from sharding to layering?  Lol, no we went from having a proper server, to have "sharding only in the starter zones at launch" to having world wide sharding for several months of launch.
---
World on privates was never the replacement for trade or general, it's shitposting central which made the communities so good. It also kept all the thin skinned idiots out of the community thus it flourished so well so don't worry about no trade or general.
---
My only concern for TBC is that everyone playing in the present day picks Horde because its objectively better in TBC. 
---
I think it would be this way on an official Classic TBC server too. I dont think TBC would be fun for Alliance with #NoChanges.
---
I just don't understand why this is so important. If you want actual boss difficulty, retail mythic is right there waiting for you.
---
TBC had some harder fights for sure, but even stuff like Mu'ru and Twins would be a joke if it came out today.
---
Even on the pservers the raids haven't been difficult at all. They never will be.
---
This isn't why I've been waiting for YEARS for classic. This haven't ever been a concern for me, and frankly if you want hardmode, Classic is not for you.
---
I'm struggling boys. I was very confident about playing a warrior. Now reality is that I won't be able to devote that type of time. So I'm thinking Hunter may be my class for Classic launch. What should I do? Damn the odds and always be behind the pack? Or take the easy route to stay with the pack?
---
I'm thinking mage or Hunter. The thing that turns me off a little with mage is getting ganked in world PvP due to the squishiness, although a PoM sheep or a good Nova+blink may be all you need.
---
Also when leveling how is a mage soloing elites? A hunter could because of the pet but how does a mage fair with spells being resisted?
---
When you know you've won ;)
---
Yeah, they are a lot of fun and a must play story wise, you get to see the origins of everyone in wow
---
Is this a joke? Started playing Vanilla in 2014? wut? 
---
If this is supposed to be comedic irony, I dont get it.
---
The Flaming Ruby! That reminds me I really need to go and find those old comics about your guild.
---
What was the name of the woman drawing them again? Chi something?
---
A Beta compatible version of Questie is already available on willitclassic.com
---
I tried to recover mine, but they said my chracters we're transferred to different account to far back for them to recover
---
Your right but I still don't like it
---
Literally the only 'fix' is for the vasy majority of the playerbase to quit.  If they have 10k players on a server 3 months from now, they literally cannot disable sharding.  They need 70% of them to quit before they can disable it.  
---
All this "layering" and "it will be turned off during P1" is just PR marketing speak.  This is sharding and it will be around permanently.
---
You're asking rhetorically, you don't want to learn. I'm wasting my time replying.
---
Beta data has reliably information on spell coefficients, we can pretty easily determine mana income and expenditure, and calculate basic combat with known and tested numbers. You dont even know what shadow oil or chilli do, or how they scale, do you? We've got confirmation they're scaling off of spellpower, and coefficients dont really change. Strength and AP doesnt scale hard enough to do real damage. By using external spell coefficients we can get our scaling to the point where stacking spellpower, using a fast weapon, fishing for non-PPM locked procs that scale off Spellpower, along with rank manupulation of Consecration, is enough to push pretty competitive dps. It's not mage, warrior, or rogue dps, but it's on a paladin, and it's dead in the middle right between rogue and warlock, in prebis. Eventually as Mage winds down, Paladin beats it, but Warlock starts scaling hard and Warlock beats Paladin. Paladin, according to sims, should hypothetically always be in 4th place out of all classes, sometimes 3rd, sometimes 5th. Upper middle of the pack. 
---
With comparable situations to the ret sims, including the same consume count, and same buffs, Rogues are in the 500~ range, warriors are in the 525 range, but spike to 600~ in execute, so depending on execute length, their dps fluctuates. 
---
Paladin, if we want to lowball it, can do 450 dps based on information on spell interactions we've gathered from the data. This is in the range, it's on the low end, and since you doubt the spec, we'll lowball it. MC DPS checks are in the 250~ range. 
---
We beat hunter, we beat warlock, and we beat any unorthodox specs, Warlock ends up outscaling, but not by a huge margin. 
---
You're talking about the difference between killing Rag with 2.5x the required DPS in PRE RAID BIS and 1.75x the dps required to kill Rag, also in prebis. At this point I wonder why you even give a shit about competition. If you gave a shit at all about the numbers of the game, and had experience with hard raiding content from any MMO, you'd realize that the level of power characters have in classic compared to the bosses is fucking insane, and that metagaming doesn't matter whatsoever if you play your class right.
---
By the end of MC warriors can tripple the dps requirements for rag and paladins can more than double it. I don't know what more you really want, if doubling required DPS isnt enough.
---
Many people will watch or listen to anything as long as they think other people like it. Very apparent with pop music and game streaming, they add no substance to anything.
---
When I was leveling I finally reached 60 on my Human Rogue and was convinced by some friends that horde was better. I couldn't bring myself to delete my 60 so I just ganked them instead. Never regretted my decision.
---
Can't wait for rogue only raids early on or warrior only later.
---
I checked, it's missing
---
Basically you want to use certain moves right before the swing animation to maximize dps
---
Chidori :) I think [tfrcomic.com](https://tfrcomic.com) is still paid for by my best friend and co-founder of TFR, Maximilian.
---
I was going to play in pserver, but I don’t want to kill my hype. I’m going to wait...
---
My horde ass concedes, I never cared for alliance builds. You can go farm a couple bags of MCPs while I educate myself, I'll probably be a while.
---
Looks good man thanks !
---
Um no im not, you yourself just said I have to dig through fansites to find info, which is exactly what I said.  Reading comprehension mate.
---
That's your defense, seriosuly?
---
It's like when you step into human shit and they make fun of you and you defend yourself by saying you stepped into horse shit.
---
If I had to vote between scum and shit, I'd rather not go voting.
---
???
---
They said if Classic is successful, then doing BC and WotLK are definitely in the realm of possibility.
---
I would say hunter fits this pretty well. They're definitely an easy to pick up but hard to master kind of class. There will always be 2-4 per raid so gear competition isn't as bad as rogue or warrior, and 1 maybe 2 per premade bg because they make very good defensive plays around flags. Very good in wpvp settings especially as the aggressor getting the drop on someone, and can solo a lot or PvE content once you learn how to best make use of your pet / ability to kite.
---
Living to Win!
---
&gt;I really feel 
---
There's your problem.
---
Kinda this, and other healers may wanne play dps too, who heals you meme specc if everyone just gos full ego.
---
yeah its much easier for young people who had 50 hand holding videos on every aspect of every game they play to assume everyone is always great at games.
---
it just was not the case back then, there were low res pvp videos with no explanation of what was going on. its so much easier to pickup any mmo now because of how much content on whats good and how to play it exists.
---
the default was A/D were turn so plenty of people new to gaming just played like that, i was just lucky because i played shooters so i changed that or i would have been a clicker and keyboard turner rofl
---
Here's some more nostalgia for you:

So worth. Carrying a 1h sword on your back blew my mind at the time.

This. I'm on the least populated EU PVE English realm and I can tell you its BORING as fk.
---
I feel like it's the most realistic looking colour, if that makes sense.
---
what is this fireres gear block nonsense? you don't need fireres gear to clear mc
---
if both parties move you have some extra melee leeway
---
You'll have a very hard time getting any gear as Elemental, so pretty much everything is a con except for PvP *IF* you have good gear.
---
name every single icon and i paypal you 500$
---
WotLK (or legion) cat/bear form models.
---
I've been bored of gaming for a couple of months now.
---
I think Classic might have a colossal impact on gaming and games when it's released. Or atleast I hope it will.
---
When developers see that people don't necessarily want these easy mode, hand holding games that's been the norm the past years, maybe there will be a change in future games.
---
This is probably just wishful thinking from my part, but I really hope that the classic servers will prosper and that it will show Blizzard and other companies that we want something more that what we've been getting lately. Only time will tell I guess.
---
you just need to read the start of the chain where people were saying that the meta would be 40 dps to understand my comment.
---
Well, they could also choose by checking or unchecking it in the settings
---
9
---
My name Jeff.
---
Oh fuck. Is this going to be like dungeons in WotLK? Pull everything in sight, AoE, rinse repeat.
---
I hated that. I've been looking forward to running dungeons in Classic where supposedly tactics and CC was going to matter.
---
 #SomeRebalanceChanges
---
People certainly got better by the end of Vanilla and going forward, but it took many many years to ramp up to the level of modern difficulty mechanically we have now.  Look at heroic bosses now, pick something from BoD and open the adventure guide, not only are there a ton of mechanics but your average heroic raider doesn't even register half those abilities.  That doesn't mean they're ignoring them, people are just trained to do so many mechanics on auto-pilot and focus on crucial mechanics, those auto-pilot mechanics would have been considered hard in vanilla like don't stand in bad. Then again people still stand in bad today so they'll be dying a lot in classic.
---
That if something is popular it must be good, especally its something subjective like a video game.
---
Justin Bieber topped the charts, and his music is still shit. Same goes for Wrath.
---
My main in Vanilla was female Undead Rogue.
---
My main in Classic will be female Night Elf Hunter.
---
Water totem quest is definitely something else (all the moreso because no one else besides shaman probably ever really see it).
---
Was originally thinking about going Troll Priest but everyone I'm going to be playing with will be going Alliance. And I'm stuck between playing Tank or Healer, never played a Paladin and it seems rather fun, but it playing Prot Paladin really completely worthless when it comes to tanking any endgame content even if they are great at tanking dungeons?
---
Well your an angry boy with a lot free time aren't ya
---
shut up sissy boy fkin pussi
---
Terrible advice
---
I think that precisely because there's no alt-friendly systems like free catch-up gear or increased artifact power gains, playing an alt makes for so much more content. It's like starting a new journey. Different class, different ways to tackle new challenges. Only this time, you can also afford some luxuries you couldn't the first time around, which makes the leveling process much more fun - a bit like cheating I guess.
---
Lfg ubrs need key, no hunters
---
Is there a faded out picture or are those items actually placed to create that?
---
Simple put: 
---
Pro: bursty lightning canon
---
Con: mana drained
---
The amount of quests and additional Lore. I love questing and solving the problems of the people.
---
Yay!!!
---
I used to think more people would be better. Then i recently did a couple of 1-20 runs on a pserver, and ran a few 5 mans.
---
Yeah, a lot people are still crap.
---
Still, Vanilla isn't very skill heavy anyway. Its mainly time spent farming gear that separates the casuals from the l77t pro gamers.
---
It was a typo, thanks for pointing it out!
---
RemindMe! 89 days

Software can absolutely be engineering. It all depends on what your doing

Just like all programming isn't Computer science all software development isn't software engineering. I wouldn't consider a web developer an engineer just like I wouldn't consider an app developer a computer scientist
---
Root, not stun.
---
I haven’t watched him in a long ass time, didn’t he shit talk the whole concept of bringing back classic wow?
---
Playing from Australia. Never lower than 300ms, and it only got worse during heavy periods or raiding.
---
but you do look at your character rear posterior all the time , or her mount
---
But who do you think are going to be the most active on WOW classic forums? The people that "casually" played WOW-classic with random builds and had some fun. Or the people that treated the game like a 2nd life, min-maxed the SHIT out of it and tried to be the best (wether in PVE or PVP). My gues would be the no-lifers have more of a connection to vanilla then the casual playerbase. Hence you get some more "pro" comments vs "Noob" comments.
---
As for myself, I mained a dorf priest, cleared ony/MC and i had a full tier1 set, with benediction, and we where 3 bosses in in BWL.  Certainly not pro, but we had fun. We where a MASSIVE social raiding guild on EU Vashj (PVP) server and because we where so big and "social" we had slow raid progression due to loot being given to more people. We had a core team of 10 ish players that had no life (wich included me) and the other 30 people in a raid came from a group of 100-120 casual raiders that would sometimes comes, sometimes not etc. We refused to google tactics for fights and figured everything out ourselfs. Was way more satisfying then just google, and copy strats imo.
---
But i do feel that we (me included) where complete nubs back then, i didn't know jack shit about BIS items, just new Devout was good, so farmed all of that before raiding. Perhaps this is why our 1st weeks of raiding where SO GODDAMN HARD, we litteraly wiped on the 1st giants in MC for 2 weeks :D
---
1440p at 144Hz, the beta client runs beautifully. Buttery smooth.
---
Why not both?
---
My Paladin being taken seriously as a legit DPS and not just a buff bot.
---
I don't think Blizzard care about Classic long term.  I think they view it as a the equivilent of a BFA content patch.  It will be a nice little filler for them during the next BFA content drought, it will boost their subs for the quarter.  Blizzard has become a very shortsited company under Activision.  I don't think they are capable of considering the long term damage decisions can have, its all about the quarterly earnings report and creating an short term boost to appease shareholders.
---
Sounds like a much better move :)
---
They arent fanboy accounts.  They are people who realized asmond doesnt care if they reupload his shit, and can make some money off of it for little to no effort.
---
That's it, just some form of rated pvp.... everyone is always #nochanges cry cry cry but farming HK's isnt skill and a rated battleground system would be cool.
---
yeah , the female NE hunter have the best bow shooting animation
---
choosing between hunter and warlock
---
heard that warlock scales better when geared
---
but I'm only going to play casually, so ZUG/TAQ/R10/reputation gear should be my top
---
mainly playing world pvp/BG, which one works better?
---
Super cool! Anyone got a 1920x1080 res version?

My gf 🤓

Also if I remember correctly you should time your slam casts so that the autohit doesn't happen while slam is casting because thats one wasted hit. Not 100% sure though.
---
I honestly can't think of anything, and I really tried.
---
Even the things added in TBC, like Arena, which I thought were a great idea at the time, and cheered about, in hindsight made the game worse. To stick with your example, Arenas caused Blizzard to desperately fix what wasn't broken (PvP), piling on thinks like resilience, which in turn they have been busy tryoing to fix ever since, and "balancing efforts" which contributed to making all classes feel more similar.
---
As a mage main: Porting people out after a dungeon is one of your jobs. Like Making Water/Food for the group.
---
Holy fuck how dumb to you have to fucking be, those links come directly from blizzard managed accounts or website. HOW THE FUCK DO YOU HAVE TO DIG. 
---
You do lie, you misinterpret, misdirect information to serve your purpose of staying uninformed on a topic you dislike FOR NO LOGICAL reason.
---
I mean, i have plenty of screen shots from vanilla that were not server firsts :D
---
Maybe it was your first. Or your guilds first.
---
Does it interrupt spell tho?
---
Damn my classic account is so far gone, I know it was stolen and/or locked ages ago. But I fucking cry for my full BF dwarf rogue. I wish there was a way to find you, Seamus!
---
Nothing.
---
I have 30 year old working hdds
---
&gt;It's not true
---
It is though. On average player skill and knowledge will go up because of modern hardware and the available information.
---
I don't even know what point you're trying to make here.
---
Transmog. And that's the **only** thing. I like having a lore-fitting outfit, but all the other features of Retail are garbage - it's a broken game really. Can't wait for Classic.
---
If you're literally just going for which number is bigger, healing has bigger numbers than damage dealing.
---
And you are someone whos opinion means nothing to me, and whom I will never hear from again. Good bye.
---
Does Race matter that much for pvp ? I want to make a night elf rogue for nostalgia reasons
---
To bad it will be 10 man like in 1.12 :(
---
Cause money xD
---
I'd pick Hunter. Warlock requires a bit of gear progression to shine in PvP imo.
---
I gotta hand it to you for your commitment though. I thought about deleting mine, until I thought about the leveling process.
---
I do believe, that you are wrong. 
---
I also dont think that using LFR or normal dungeons from retail as the comparson to Classic is any good. Retail is a faceroll.
---
People have gotten better at the game, and the raid encounters in Classic will not be as demanding on player skill as retail is.
---
So I will continue to use the perfectly good argument that player skill will make raiding in Classic easier than it was in vanila, and that this will allow more meme specs to enter raiding.
---
No. First Aid, Cooking and Fishing are all secondary professions, and you can have them all. You can only pick two primary professions at the same time (Skinning, Leatherworking, Enchanting, Blacksmithing, Mining, Herbalism, Alchemy, Tailoring, Engineering)
---
Ty
---
Any chance sharing that list?
---
Plate with agi: top tier classic loot.
---
i dont understand this line of thinking, this is a new one , why would one perv on his own character ? an mmorpg character is like a virtual action figure where kids once play with , playing leia and luke against dartvader action figurine
---
Mad people are complaining about paying a sub, can't see all the work they've done because WE wanted them to had been very cheap + upkeep costs. More than happy to pay a subscription!
---
More imbalance - that was the start of classes being balanced around comps instead of balancing overall.
---
Out of interest how were you notified? Did you have to re-start your launcher to see it appear on the drop down list etc? Gz on the invite!
---
We had a wealth of information back then as well. Thottbot existed, so did guidebooks, written tutorials, whathaveyou. They were just a little harder to find, and not in the form of videos.
---
Are your recovered characters added to your current subscription? I recently had my account recovered as well, but customer service put my characters on a separate subscription.
---
I'm working on a list aswel and will share that for sure in a few weeks.
---
It's also making use of old data, stay tuned.
---
Look forward to level 26, you get all the abilities of your kit till max level!
---
I took the hz and the game felt really different in a positive way. 
---
Plus afaik you can upscale the resolution.
---
Yeah, you cant tank raids as a Palaidn. They're almost always healers. The lack of a taunt holds them back a lot
---
In 1.12 WoW none of that matters until like BWL/AQ lmao. Players were TRASH back then and had terribly connections and fps and itemization in earlier patche (they time when most players did those dungeons) was terrible and classes have received TONS of buffs throughout the patches. I do believe vanilla was decently hard in 1.0 since that is when the creatures in leveling dungeons were tuned properly but after that patch after patch player classes only got stronger and stronger from buffs and i doubt blizz touched the mobs. We are just looking at 1.12 classes and itemization fighting what is essentialy 1.0 tuned mobs and players are way better so everything is so face roll...
---
It’s main hand, sorry my guy. It got changed in ~Cata.
---
When a game is new, imbalances take some time to show.  People don't know the meta so lack of player knowledge/skill limits how dramatic the imbalances can be.
---
Classic WoW is so old and its meta so refined that imbalances are *incredibly* dramatic.  People have rose colored nostalgia goggles on about how memespecs "weren't that bad" but that's only because most people playing main specs weren't as good as they will be now.  If the average mage during vanilla was shit, then an exceptional moonkin could maybe come close.  Nowadays, the average mage will be so much better than even the best moonkin that "lol memespec" is going to be *more* dramatic, not less.
---
... and that brings up paladins vs. shamans.  Paladins are *significantly* better than shamans at everything.  The meta has evolved such that this will be dramatically obvious on classic.
---
People will play horde for a while and think it's awesome, and then after 6 months when the paladin player base gets up to speed and starts playing their classes really well, they will lose every BG that has a couple of decent paladins in them and they will bitch and moan so hard on the forums.  Then they'll realize why paladins were given to horde for TBC even though it makes no lore sense at all... to stop the whining.
---
I didn't know Kazzak was a world boss in vanilla. I thought it was just in Hellfire.
---
I didn't see end-game until WotLK. All I did was leveled alts and some random BGs in Vanilla and TBC. Endgame just didn't looked interesting.
---
I cant go back to under 144hz anymore... Its really smooth and looks awesome
---
wow.
---
Many adds pulled by bad tab targeting(either sending an auto or their pet), multishot, not dismissing their pet when jumping down(same with locks), feigning death dropping aggro onto the healer after the add pulls
---
Most of the bad rap comes from dungeon pickup group runs.  It's a very easy class to level with a tanky pet which is accounts for the stigma against "bear pet" Hunters.  Basically it was easy to be bad but still succeed on Hunter
---
I guess its a testament to the Vanilla experience though. It wasn't about having a max level toon and doing end game content, so much as the community and the journey. I had plenty of fun levelling my shaman and enjoyed it for what it was, especially because I got to experience the game from the horde perspective.

144hz is a massive upgrade over 60hz. 1440p is cool but it's nowhere near as good. After 144hz 60hz will feel very sluggish to you.

u mad bro? chill.

Good healers don't need to drink o7
---
Ahhh thanks for clearing that up for me. Appreciated.
---
Night Elf rogue is pretty good, you are only losing out a very tiny bit by going for them in pvp. Totally go for it.
---
Ret pally doesn’t want to auto attack without a seal.

Not having pet and mount tabs is going to suck

ty , can't wait to make him :D

Got WoW Christmas 2006 so pretty much pre-tbc. Elwynn still felt the same as vanilla. Never will forget seeing a 60 lock and his felguard minion in the vineyards in Northshire. Was so fucking confused what I was seeing!
---
It's the toughest stretch in the game.  It sounds appealing when you consider STV, Feralas, Tanaris, and Searing Gorge for leveling, but it isn't enough to get to 50 from quests alone.  Thankfully things pick up pretty well from 50-60.
---
Lots of quick responses. Going to go with the hz upgrade thanks all :)
---
&gt; this will allow more meme specs to enter raiding.
---
Just FYI, what you call "Meme Specs", was used in raids back then as well. PServer Kids have poisoned the well pretty well here, but I played alongside Boomkins, Enhancers, Ferals, Arcane Mages, and even Melee Hunters. There were multiple Retpallys in the big alliance guilds on the server, some of which were well respected PvPers.
---
i can understand some ppl project themselves on their character so they  would prefer it to be their ideal form of themselves.. 
---
i also understand some ppl view characters as virtual action figures to be played according to the “director” aka player.
---
so the “actor” type players will prefer playing their own image
---
the “director” type player will create character based on their fantasies / stories / roleplay
---
I tried explaining this in another post and like 5 people replies and had no clue what I was saying. They were just like who cares take your time enjoy the game! I probably will, but if I was playing the shit out of the beta right now and playing all the content, you can bet on release I’d speed level to 60. They are getting play the game both was.
---
Yeah, you can basically trade 1 hit for 1 hit. Since most mobs attack faster than you. It did take some time getting used to.
---
And for 10 minutes I was doing that with a 1H weapon with the same attack speed as the mobs. I felt so stupid afterwards. Better for 2H.
---
This is why people say the WoW community is toxic.
---
This made it so after I got my eye never went back lol 3 hour grief fest
---
To be fair, those are professions.
---
female panda is so ugly , male even worse., never rolled a panda race ever
---
Yes it would be them going to every dungeon and nerfing every mob. But this is effectively the same thing because every class got a lot stronger and the gear got a lot better while the dungeons and raids stayed the same. But go ahead and argue semantics if that makes you feel any better.
---
Mobs tagging, cause it’s not fun starting to cast a spell on a mob only to have it stolen by a charging warrior.
---
IMO,
---
I think this is due to us being able to view the streamers playing, if they said "Closed beta, no streaming" I don't people would feel like they are missing out. The streamers need to be entertaining, its their job, so they are coming up with ways to have fun and stream classic wow in a beta environment. It's not a beta to them in the same way it would be to a non streamer.
---
Rogues will want to time their instant attacks (sinister strike/backstab and eviscerate) to land right after a MH attack occurs because windfury procs, hand of justice procs, and sword specialization procs all reset your mainhand weapon swing. So if I'm dpsing a boss, not energy capped, and I can use sinister strike, I'll wait for my mainhand auto to hit before using it. Otherwise there's a good chance I'll clip my autos.
---
And a [slippery slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope) is a fallacy for a reason. Just because you could reasonably say it *could* happen, doesn't mean that it will. A pet name is just a cosmetic thing that plays no part in the game other than helping people relive their nostalgia as they try to recreate their original character. No other random player in the game would be able to reasonably tell if the names are the same unless they look up the original warlock toon on the current WoW.
---
However, giving people mounts/PvP ranks/gold/pre-leveled toons from current WoW would all be game changing that *would* affect every other player in the game. Those arguments are completely non-equivalent to that of a pet name.
---
I'm not saying that Warlocks should be able to obtain the name of their original pets (\#NoChanges and all), but if it would help people feel more at home playing their character again, it really wouldn't affect anyone else in the game.
---
&gt; We had a wealth of information back then as well.
---
Not nearly as vast and accessible as it is now. Looking up some quests when Vanilla was current was a complete crapshoot as to if you'd find useful information or nothing at all. Top guilds had no idea how Deep Breath worked.
---
Players on average will be better than they were 10 years ago.
---
**Slippery slope**
---
A slippery slope argument (SSA), in logic, critical thinking, political rhetoric, and caselaw, is a consequentialist logical fallacy in which a party asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect. The core of the slippery slope argument is that a specific decision under debate is likely to result in unintended consequences. The strength of such an argument depends on the warrant, i.e. whether or not one can demonstrate a process that leads to the significant effect.

I'mma gonna rock your raid, but don't worry about me pulling threat yo cause I've put **8** points in threat reduction. If your healers go OOM I can save the day with my +5% crit healing and improved renew ticks. If your tank dies I can offtank while healing myself thanks to Healing Focus. Failing that I'll just Improved Fear that raid boss or even chain blackout procs on him. I'll be getting all the killing blows so 5/5 Spirit Tap to help us quickly get to the next boss.
---
Either they cry that it's a sub to play game. Or they cry that the game has micro transactions. Or a mix of them. 
---
EvE online has a good system with limited freeplay and a cheap sub to gain access to everything. And a cash shop for cosmetics and xp items for new players that want to catch up faster.
---
Oh didn't know you could filter YouTube.
---
That is actually useful information.
---
Aww, that was my server! Alliance side though. Great, great memories
---
Hunter or Druid (HORDE RP-PVP) - I will many times play alone due to limited time so I am looking which one is better for lvl 60 casual play (farming gold for mount, having fun in dungeon, maybe some lower raiding).

Ure welcome.

---
For Alliance, or Horde if you dont mind travelling a lot.
---
“The pack” will be a lot of different groups, really. 
---
There’s going to be the people who dedicate an unhealthy amount of time, either initially or overall. (12 hours a day without stopping.) and a larger middle ground that still keep their jobs and relationships intact. 
---
My point is, if you’re not going to be no-lifeing it, you won’t be the first to endgame content anyway. So just pick a class you enjoy, for whatever reason you enjoy it. Vanilla is a lot more about the journey than anything else.
---
I agree, people are still god awful at the game and PvP.... I mainly played TBC- wrath s6 and come back every now and again to do some arenas with friends for maybe a month or two and stop playing.
---
That being said every single time I come back it astounds me how easy it is to climb rating and the lack of skill 90% of people have and lack of situational awareness. 
---
In particular I have a friend who argues that it's harder now than back in the day, but all he does is have an addon that pretty much tells him the whole game and he understands little without it. I firmly believe this gives people the illusion of skill.
---
Maybe I am biased since I have never used a single addon, but I still climb to the top 1% of every season I play with little effort.
---
Stop posting things that make no sense at all.
---
&gt;I would like if the price was NORMALIZED in lower-earning countries. Some european countries have average salaries of 300$ per MONTH, so a monthly fee costing the same in, let's say Ukraine and U.S. does not feel RIGHT.
---
That doesn't make any sense. The upkeep cost for the serves, and otehr expenditures are the same, no matter where the players live. By your logic, people in the Ukraine should also pay less for a car than a German?
---
The game feels exactly like vanilla, because it is vanilla. 
---
I thought you guys weren't just chasing a feeling? I thought you wanted the game exactly as it was as sort of a museum piece? 
---
If you want something that feels nothing like vanilla, maybe some of the private servers will stay up.
---
If the derank healing spells intimidate you, I suggest Paladin. They're very simple as far as healers go. You cast flash of light.
---
I am happy to hear this.
---
The only thing I would miss is that you could use the summoning stones outside of dungeons. Super useful when your pal is on the other side of the world and you don't want to pay a warlock.
---
I really hope when I refer to my own teenage stupidity that people aren’t assuming I’m as dumb as this guy.
---
Haha JK
---
But not really
---
I’m male irl and ALL my toons have been females to this day. It just feels more «right».
---
what metric you use to measure players ? pvp ? pve ? skill at making gold aka rich ? walking encyclopedia of WoW ? good in raids  ? good in dungeons ? polite and never ninja chests?
---
Unrelated question but how/where did you learn to make this? Been trying to get into programming as a hobby and creating/maintaining addons seems really interesting to me.
---
Why couldn’t my dad be this cool...A fucking multi, multi-millionaire, but bitched about the subscription fee after buying WoW for Christmas for a straight month before actually subscribing for 13 year old me. Never played with me, never was interested and playing WoW around my parents was always a fucking problem for them. So glad I’m an adult now (25 years old).
---
I did most of the dungeons on Argent Dawn EU alliance side first, and if you look at the screenshot you'll see that it's not only my guild :) Pretty sure this is server first.
---
absolutely KIMOCHI
---
Vanilla (and I think every expansion until Cata?) capped most dungeons at 10 people, only a few late game dungeons like scholo were specifically capped at 5 people
---
Here you can see a TBC 10-man doing Deadmines, for some reason:

---
lvl 19 priest twink is a god even among other twinks
---
i believe gathering and organizing 40 ppl will be the challenge instead of the skill to execute the raid
---
Oh for sure. I had my Human Rogue and my other Alliance alts. I loved leveling the different classes, but I also enjoyed the 60 instance more than anything. Scholo and Strat are still some of my favorites. I don't think I could give my 60 up for anything.
---
Spec of what, exactly?
---
Each class does damage or heals in different ways, usually. 
---
I know Paladins have really high burst healing, but lose out on sustained healing compared to say, Druids.
---
&gt;arenas are trash, wpvp is fun
---
Ah, so you don't like a fair fight but you do like ganking lowbies.  Got it.
---
Hi :)
---
It's me the guy from before
---
Yeah, even though it’s the only game I play and still would probably keep playing. The only good thing about not having it, is not getting burnt out. 
---
I know these streamers are making good money playing the game and what not, but holy crap they are literally not sleeping or playing 14 hrs straight!!!
---
Not sure how they will not get burnt out after release, but maybe I wouldn’t if I was getting payed to play too.
---
Yea, it sucked. It was marginally better dps but you're void isn't as good at threat/mana, you don't have instant summons for world pvp, and you run oom constantly meaning more down time.
---
Lfr and queueing would convert account to bfa and there would be no support backwards
---
No, it's already in the beta.
---
Definitely not my guilds first. It could be it's the first clear where I had the quest to do Drakkisath judging by the text, if that was server first or not I'm not sure, but our server was fairly slow in doing "end game" PVE stuff.
---
I'm having the same thoughts was set on warrior for a while but now I'm thinking mage will be easier. Which is true for leveling, but gathering my BiS list to go raid might be a different story. I think it might be easier tanking on a warrior rather then competing with the other dps/heals.(which would probably be easier as a hunter over mage)
---
As the tank you can pick and choose who comes in your group and even reserve items getting your raid gear that much faster. Maybe there is some flaw in my theory but it's something to consider.
---
Honestly Druid forces you to become a better healer in 5 mans. Priest and shammy have less resource management because it doesn’t matter if they let s dps die cause they can Rez. Druid you gotta keep everyone alive, forces you to make sure you are managing your mana and not over or under healing
---
* DRUID - I heard it's the jack of all trades, solid at everything but master of nothing. If I were to roll this class I'd need a dedicated guild and leveling partner and knowing I'll have a spot for everything we do.
---
* HUNTER - The only that that's putting me off is the ammo and pet system that was in vanilla otherwise I'd probably pick hunter for great soloing abilities, great pvp potential, damage in raids I heard isn't the best but I'm not gonna play classic to top the meters and nobody should to be honest as I feel like vanilla wow is the game where every class has benefits and is really good at something.
---
* MAGE - really not my thing for some reason I can't really put into words. Really don't want a class that has to sit down to eat/drink after every pull or so.
---
* PALADIN - mained holy paladin back in my teenage years in vanilla, not sure i wanna do the same again as I just find retri boring for farming (seal up, judgement, seal up, wait for 20%, hammer, somewhat better rotation against undeads tho)
---
* PRIEST - hearing a lot of good things about priests, great healing, shadow is great for pvp and farming solo as well.
---
* ROGUE - since my favorite playstyle is melee this class won't be a bad choice for me I'm just not sure I'd like rogue's ability to solo farm stuff.
---
* SHAMAN - FOR THE ALLIANCE, at least for now I'm thinking like that, I wouldn't be opposed to go horde for Shaman though but that's only if I find a dedicated guild with leveling partners that need a certain shaman for a specific role. Just don't feel like managing totems and stuff is my thing.
---
* WARLOCK - really liking this class, good for soloing, good for pvp, after bwl really good damage as well.
---
* WARRIOR - wouldn't mind tanking to be honest but just like with shaman i'd need a dedicated, top mentality guild that needs this role AND a leveling partner all the way to 60 which I am still looking for.
---
As you can see there are classes I really like the look of or have played (holy paladin) back in the days but not sure I wanna do it again. The best thing that would help me the most deciding what to do would be finding a dedicated guild and leveling partner(s) with the same mindset I'm going into classic wow with. Currently spending a lot of time watching vids, streams and reading guides to figure what I wanna do, also I'm still looking for a dedicated leveling partner for launch, let me know if you are interested! (EU) (also... I have no experience with any class in vanilla apart from paladin and warrior to mid lvl30s which I quit afterwards for obvious reasons - solo leveling is tough as a warrior especially if you are a kid new to the game and having no clue about most things haha, so if I made any mistakes in my class write up I apologize and looking forward to hearing from more experience players. Thanks!)
---
&gt;Just because you could reasonably say it could happen, doesn't mean that it will.
---
Of course it doesn't mean that it will happen. It's just likely that it will. When people point to you that you made this change happen. They're gonna say "Well, Blizzard, you changed the ability to name your pet demons, why won't you let me name my mount?" and so on and so on. I have nothing against naming demon pets, couldn't care less about it. But changes mostly happen slowly and over a long period of tim. Then  enough of them can happen and ruin stuff. **Not saying that this will happen 100% if they let you name your demon.**
---
any photo from the hidden airport of ironforge?
---
again, Wegwacc, your comparsons are off. You cant really compare the information avaible on Thottbot in 2004/05 to the infromation available now, on Youtube, Reddit, Discord and so on. 
---
We know everything about the game now, and it isnt even out yet. You can learn everything about the game now, every tactic, spec comp, questline, profession. You can learn it all in detail right now.
---
That really varies from server to server. Both types of players play both sides.
---
Sweet child. Never look up Skyrim mods.
---
You might not get that a lot, but thank you, it really does help us.
---
It’s actually worth it again.
---
People comment this forgetting that I’m the one who picked it lol
---
I did quite a lot of dungeons including UBRS. The first time I saw the fucking mage robe drop at all was after I was decked out in BWL gear. 
---
And then consider rolling against 2-3 other people playing your class.
---
15man UBRS was weird.
---
Should be reading the Chronicle books
---
I don't remember too many Horde names, but I remember Legion of Lemmings being the Horde guild that had progressed the furthest in Vanilla, and names like Hidrasactum or something being a PVP (WSG/AV) beast being one of the first to reach 100k pvp kills.
---
Why is internet communication so hard
---
I loved TBC, however decent balance? Really? Do you not remember how good Resto Druids were compared to every other healer?
---
Monk. I know a lot of Classic players hate MoP and Monks but I thoroughly enjoy the class, specifically Windwalker. No specs in Classic are really similar to the Windwalker playstyle so I'm still not sure what I'm going to go with once the games out.
---
This isn't correct. We should keep straight what's happening here:
---
* The beta is easier compared to people's *memories.*
---
* But the beta is considerably harder compared to pservers.
---
These two issues are getting confused.
---
It was mostly just the grind. Many of us came from harder games that seemed to hate you. The actual mechanics weren't toooo bad.
---
That's the one, thank you very much!  
---
Though I get an error on the homepage and no link to the comic itself. :(
---
Yea the meme spec thing is tired imo. Cause if you bring all optimal specs for Mc and bwl you don’t even need a full 40 man. Think we are going to see a lot of non viable specs being allowed to raid and doing fine.
---
0/10
---
Hi, /u/riklaunim
---
You are god damn right, and I don't fucking give a shit about PvP balance in a MMORPG, if I did I wouldn't be playing a MMORPG.
---
I want better fucking gear and shit on people who are weaker than I am, thats  an RPG for you.
---
You a physicist with that name?
---
God this is too fucking rich, and it's exposing so many people as frauds. 
---
Now we want changes to match the private server experience? I thought you weren't all just chasing some vague "feeling". I thought it was more important to make it as accurate as possible as sort of a museum piece. I thought any change was a slippery slope. 
---
"You think you do, but you don't."
---
&gt; They were just a little harder to find, and not in the form of videos.
---
That is exactly why people that may not have looked things up 15 years ago will do so today and thereby have more knowledge and interpret the game as easier.
---
 *In the future, Kotick said Activision-Blizzard will invest primarily in  live services, Battle.net, and esports, with a focus on the following  franchises: Candy Crush, Call of Duty, Overwatch, Warcraft, Diablo, and  Hearthstone. For those franchises, Activision actually expects to  increase, not reduce, development resources in 2019.*
---
No they're not you clown lol
---
I agree. This would be the only sensible way to do things.
---
Your attempt at a meme shows that you don't care. You didn't need to specify that in the title.
---
Yeah sure... :D
---
Best of luck, you won't regret it. :)
---
Well i used to raid with 1-4 FPS looking at the floor to not lag, so im instantly better now since i can see shit properly.
---
You are doomed, I'm a completanist myself and the exalted grind will be brutal, but oh so satisfying.
---
I played rogue and Leveled everything. Rogues have even their own crafting and talents to level. 
---
I always had so much stuff to do.
---
Fishing, poison, lockpicking, cooking... etc
---
So good when you finally get it all to 300.
---
 now i can steal someones intelligence-staff with words "thats because im a hunter-healer"
---
"Leave me alone" wow style for your door.... so epic
---
It changed in BC.
---
￼ Patch 2.4.2 (2008-05-13): Converted from Main Hand to One-Hand. 
---
I had dual phantom blades lol but no way bc was out. Hmmm...
---
I played a druid main to r10 and through BWL. I enjoyed it but plan to change it up with a paladin this time around for something new.
---
Started playing a human warrior in 2004, still playing one in 2019 and will do so in classic as well (just giving you more data points to work with here).
---
yuUUUp, only takes 160ping from Melbourne to San jose, but wow ping was always 300-400. :/
---
FYI: there are multiple medication options for ADD nowadays. Some aren't even stimulants. You're better off not wasting your time.
---
Will see if I can poke my friend to get them back up :)
---
Well there is no real need for a lot of testing. They need to hype people to pay Subs, thats it :D
---
herb/skinning is going to be the best for a while for devilsaur leather for pre raid BIS and black lotus.. mining always drops off quick
---
will probably drop skinning later when devilsaur falls off a bit and get alchemy or enchanting
---
Now there is an idea. Blizzard makes money off of people in so many ways, it’s crazy. People are literally paying to play the beta, because you have to have an active sub to get in.
---
Then thousands of people sub this month, and the majority don’t get in hahaha. It’s almost kind of evil. The game looks like it’s going to be go, but we are dealing with a different company than we were in the early 2000s.
---
Anyone have any specific recommendations? What monitors are y’all using
---
Barber shop. I change my hair color daily. 
---
Maybe transmog.
---
Gonna roll an undead mage. Main in vanilla was an undead mage. Still undecided on whether I shall try for same name / server. Only difference this time around is I plan on levelling a warrior alt. The warrior will be VERY slow though.
---
Im considering playing mage in classic. How are they leveling and max content? PVP/PVE wise? I've always swapped between all three roles so kind of open to try anything in classic.
---
I find that a bold statement. One server can have ten or more realms on it and the realm can have ten or more layers on it. It doesnt improve costs really to expand that.  
---
Also, at the press release of the fired employees, they state:  
---
Thank you, kind sir.
---
Guildbank.
---

You have it the wrong way around. People who claimed it was changed in Vanilla should be able to point out a 1.x Patch that changed it, since everyone agrees that you WOULD be ported back to the bm at some point during Vanilla.
---
That's not a true democracy at all. Posts are prefiltered by the relatively small amount of people that browse by new which basically create an echo chamber amongst themselves. It's been proven that the larger the decrepency between the number of people that browse new vs hot the more likely posts are to misrepresent the majority.  As you approach higher and higher proportions of people browsing new, the less this effect has on that subreddit.
---
This was a huge issue on the wow pserver subreddit with "shill" groups that focused on downvoting and spreading misinformation in new posts about anything that wasn't their chosen server in an attempt to bring traffic to their server over others regardless of quality.
---
I am in the Beta and I'm pretty bored and already stopped playing. 
---
It was useful so far to test out the Warlock Quests I didn't do since TBC and just refresh my mind on the Questroute till 30, but its definitely not as fun as it could be.
---
Especially as a European who doesn't play during NA Times the Server feels very empty and you have a hard time finding Groups for Dungeons etc when its 0400 for all the Americans which make up at least 80% of the Server.
---
None of the castbars are good. 
---
None of them can detect interrupts or the enemy canceling the cast.
---
All of them rely on mob naming to decide where to show the bar, so if you're fighting two defias pillagers, and one of them casts fireball, you'll see a fireball bar on both.
---
They're kind of ass.
---
But why is it likely that this slippery slope will come to fruition? Now you're saying that people will get to name their mounts? That isn't even a thing in the current version of WoW so why would anyone ask for that? Again, all these slippery slope arguments are non-equivalent because they change the fundamental aspects of the game.
---
Now if you said claimed someone might say "I got Baron Rivendare's Charger to drop for me on the first time I killed him! I want that to happen again!" I might understand. But even then, that has a determined drop rate and would affect other players in the game. The most equivalent argument I would see is if people complained they can't name their hunter pets the same as they were originally, but those *are* able to be named the same since those are player generated.
---
I did the same shit when I like 9 or 10! Didnt hump per say but would push against the couch and thought it felt good.  Didnt understand why haha.
---
I recommend ultrawide 21:9 (3440x1440 in my case) - epic immersion, MxR would approve ;)
---
This is why I'm so mad about druids having cyclone.
---
For fun?
---
Ironfoe is just insane, assuming it's working as our sims show. It's a bit fuzzier than MCP, which we know does good damage with 100% surety. 
---
The build isn't really 1h for sure, and I think there might be some issues with Ironfoe simming, but currently it's best sim choice because it gives us so many chances per proc to chain procs into other procs. SoR is proccing native weapon procs (IE Ironfoe's extra hit, but not Shadow Oil or external weapon procs), so you have two chances to proc it per connecting swing. 
---
It's cheesy paladin stuff, even if we have the proc rate off, Ironfoe will be pretty strong, but MCP will be better.
---
Assuming Ironfoe is as good as we thing it is, it's permabis. We would never replace Ironfoe if it works like we think. We don't really care about weapon damage, we care about attack volume and procs. 
---
Yeah, i hopped on the ret train a year ago thinking I'd be playing a bad class going into classic lol.
---
My bad on misremembering the changed date. I figured it got changed together with most other Main Hand only, for some QoL to the Transmog peeps.
---
On the Beta I leveled cooking while leveling and its neat, but its also a pain especially 1-75.
---
To all you people celebrating how you were right and won this argument: Is this actually the Classic you looked forward to, breezing through dungeons without any challenge?
---
why rush the good thing ? beta is for testing and if you burn out on beta it wont fun come august.. not to mention you lost all your effort in beta when it reset.
---
the only reason to be in beta is to help blizzard debug the game , not for your personal enjoyment. Streamers are used by blizz to act as influencers aka advertisers
---
What’s the bear equivalent?
---
As a protection Paladin, my main has changed so much that it’ll be like playing a completely new class anyway!
---
I’m really looking forward to the things that made me fall in love with Paladins to begin with. Seals, Auras, Divine Intervention to name a few. 
---
I’ll have a different username(so my current online community will recognize me) but the characters name will always be the same in my heart. 
---
I’m an old school DnD player, too. So I always have my “character” in mind. This’ll be a fun reboot of his story. :)
---
never get beta access from blizzard, dont see why i would now.
---
Far from expert here.. I did UBRS and I felt like a KING!
---
Yeah, and even Garr can be managed if you've got enough decently suited up tanks and a small handful of locks that know how to communicate. Can be dicey though 100%
---
Is there another sword that looks just like it?
---
No way it was 2008... Hmmm
---
I hope they would create separate realms where you can copy paste classic characters. I don’t want to level a classic character only to be “forced” into TBC and wrath (even though they’re my favorite)
---
They have zero plans for that currently.
---
Ooo look! Fire! Lets go play in it! :D
---
How much will we have to pay you to not release your list?
---
Not taking care of memes correctly on reddit is a big No No
---
I miss Palm pilots / window pocket pc's there was something cool about having a Desktop type interface/features on a portable device that modern phones don't replicate
---
When I am going to level my paladin, I'll level fishing to the max as soon as I can and use the highest damage fishing pole that I can. I'll have massive crit and hit chance when I actually fight mobs, and I'll make sick cash while doing so.
---
I'd say rogue or warrior, the casters don't really end up doing flips.
---
There is no way blizzard would ever do that though. Has a game ever been released where they rebalanced it for the remaster? It's completely unheard of. To think blizzard would re-tune the entire game is just wishful thinking. The best you can hope for is they release some sort of hardcore vanilla version later, but they were never gonna release a modified vanilla before the original anyways.
---
1.	I’m not even sure it’s possible. How many assets from classic have a 1:1 equivalent in the modern game? How much extra time would it take for them to go through and make new assets for the game for everything that didn’t?
---
2.	The biggest problem is that when two people are looking at what is supposed to be the same thing but are actually seeing two different things, it can cause imbalance. They’re using the newer models which (lets say) are slightly easier to see in the distance against the background. All of a sudden it becomes advantageous to use the newer models and those of us who prefer the older ones are at a disadvantage.
---
Yeah I feel the same way.  This sub has been astroturfed to the point of no return.  Its just a shit meme factory now.  
---
I think the astroturfers goal is to just downvote anything thats not a meme.  The only way to find real discussions is to go to the controversial tab.  I think Blizzard would rather hide all the talk about inaccuracies, sharding etc.
---
If you did, you'd have seen Ion talk about how at the end of phase1 all the layers of a server will be rolled into one, the layering being there to handle day 1 load and continuous connections, the later week connections will be more spread out and easier to handle.
---
Something you'd know or would have understood if you had seen the information and used your brain.
---
I never even hit 60 back in vanilla lol
---
A lot of streamers got invites, even the smaller ones. It’s from them we are seeing a lot of the news, and content, so yeah it seems like streamers only, but your right there are a pile of testers that aren’t streaming at all.
---
stuns? blinds? idk lol and I quit playing wow after they released cataclysm cause everything after wrath was dog shit.
---
warlocks were fodder until maybe the mid 40s and up lol.
---
i dont play skyrim
---
Wouldn’t a competition to find 10 real reportable issues instead make actual use of your access that not everyone is blessed with?  You are literally the fate of everyone.  A LOT of people I know were NOT given stress test access, let alone beta access.  Don’t you care about the people?  You, me, everybody?
---
This works to an extent, though I think something like Questie is fundamentally detrimental to the game and should not be included.
---
Just get lost exploring, do what instincts come first and learn as you go. You will have lots of fun this way
---
Zzzzz another "Why didn't Blizz invite me, a serious vanilla gamer to their beta instead of streamers" thread.
---
Sweet! I need to finish grading papers and setting up my VR workstation, but I'll peek back in to check later on. :)
---
Yeah i dont see it as much of a win and its awful actually i am going to make another post to explain why i think people's perceptions were so wrong
---
You, i and everyone else knows that most will not be sitting there looking for bugs if they got there hands on beta. They will be playing the game regularly and if they come across a bug, they will report it just like the streamers are doing.
---
Well 10 agi its like 0,5 Crit for a plate user. But the one Use effect is the real deal man. An extra charge with a sap effect
---
rais_Autoshot is amazing, would you ever consider just fixing that?
---
\#nochanges though, I had addon cast bars back in the day, and I want them again.
---
I am a little bias with druid because it was my first character.  Hunter is best for solo farming and pvp.  But druid, imo, can change it up if you ever get bored of a role.  Also a nice hybrid spec like 0/30/21 can  switch from dungeon tanking or melee dps to healing with just some gear swapping.  This build can work in pvp and raiding though if you did get into raiding though expect to heal.
---
But like I said that is my completely bias option. :P
---
I know there's a quest reward one, but that's from Netherstorm.
---
You sure it wasn't Hanzo Blades or something like that? They don't have the ghostly look, but they're little katanas that also sheathe on the back and look pretty sick with enchants.
---
Yea I've heard that before. The youtube audience seems to be predominantly monkeys that just reacts to basic stimuli without thinking.
---
To be fair I have to try very hard to avoid top10 lists. They don't pop up a lot for me anymore but when there is one and the topic is interesting, I tend to be tempted and sometimes just click without thinking (just to then go back and click "do not suggest this crap anymore")
---
It's so de-dignifying what these algorythms are doing. Everyone thinks they're such fucking precious snowflakes but these algorithms really show us that deep down you can throw 90% of the population in the same drawer. It's easy to get offended by this but if you can deduce techniques to manipulate an overwhelming majority of people you really gotta question how freaking unique we really are.
---
My friend, that is, in my humble opinion, not true. If you are renting servers / hiring software engineers to keep them running etc. In U.S. you'll pay U.S. salaries and rents and in Ukraine you'll pay Ukrainian salaries and rents. 
---
The car example is difference because it is a good that can easily be transported from one place to the other, the same thing as with any other gadget like iphones, laptops etc.  A WOW subscription cannot be resold/speculated with so it wouldn't alter the price of wow subscriptions in US, while if you sell a car adjusted to a country's salaries, people might take it to the US and sell it there, hurting your business. 
---
Some costs remain the same like the cost of "designing" the game, while others are way cheaper like what I said: servers, people working there, customer support/game masters etc. 
---
Overall, I think it comes down to the next: If the AVERAGE salary of a working adult is 200 $ per month, asking 15$ per month for a videogame subscription seems madness. Some will be able to afford it, but I hope that'd be normalized so this great game was accessible to the general public, like it is in western countries and not the richest 1%.
---
They give blizzard free advertising, you dont. its a smart business decision.
---
It may not make sense, but this is how steam (and some other stores) work. This is “regional pricing” (please correct me if I’m wrong)
---
That extra bottle icon on the left side is bugging the shit out of me.
---
who doesn't love a good cult? Cult leaders get _all_ the ladies.
---
The only down votes I have seen have been people bitching about not getting into beta.
---
\&gt;Is it really #nochanges if theres going to be a bunch of addons changing the game anyway?
---
If the addons were already available in vanilla? Really?
---
Don't think I said once in the post that I wanted an invite, or than I'm not currently a part of the Beta as it stands. Thanks for the constructive reply.
---
I can’t decide if I want to start out with a Druid or a rogue. I maimed a rogue back in vanilla and will definitely be getting one to 60 again for PVP 
---
HOWEVER, i plan on playing a lot and might power level a feral Druid tank to 60 and then have that to make it easier for leveling a rogue. (Might even squeeze in a 19 Twink if that will be possible again)
---
Since they are sharding everything anyway, they really should just allow a free trial at launch.  They won't for money reasons though.
---
Na I got these because they were see through.
---
I need to go back and find out when I played.
---
Yeah it’s advertisement. That is extremely clear. Streamers weren’t invited to the beta to test content and mechanics that is pretty obvious.
---
Mages ruled in classic. I played a frost mage and raided mostly MC/ZG and PVP. The hardest part was the oversaturation of mages. Pretty tough to get in a good raiding guild/pugs/premades.
---
Easier to sort your loot and you won't forget to loot a mob around you.
---
I would love it to be added tho, no gameplay changes like the mailbox, just a small QoL feature.
---
Ah we had a mage like that. He played like shit and spun around in circles a lot. He ended up marrying a Canadian girl from WoW and improved a lot when he started playing from Toronto 😁
---
Firey enchant and shitty bag drop rates are the reason my pally was enchanter/tailor
---
welcome to fabulous reddit
---
This is what has me hoping that Classic TBC will be a thing some day.  I know it's controversial, but for the most part, hybrids were trash in Vanilla.  You were forced into being a one trick pony if you wanted a raid slot and that one trick was spamming heals.  In TBC, Prot Pallies and Ele Shaman (two of my 3 favorite classes) were not only viable, but actually useful.  I haven't played in years, but to me, this was the pinnacle of the game from a purely class ability perspective or at least as far as hybrids are concerned.
---
Not really, we're moving into territory where there's absolutely no lose condition. You have to actually try in order to fail, and that's not fun.
---
Well, to be honest, they are actually reacting and fixing stuff pretty fast, so at this very case, yeah, it's only beta. 
---
Maybe it's not true for other Blizz games, but for this one, they are pretty damn active.
---
&gt;  As long as we have Tanks, Healers and DPS, we are a go.
---
You don't say....
---
Agree completely, don't get me wrong. The point I'm making is a lot of players are trying to work out the meta for level 30. And they're min maxing their level 30 characters. There's a hell of a lot of content from 1-30 that could be retested, and I mean, there's 9 classes and 8 races. I'm sure priorities can move from trying to have the biggest DPS on a level 30 cap to testing some of the content.
---
Once you get a wand, it's actually insane.
---
Cast time is 3 seconds and talented it reduces it to a 1 second cast.
---
It's amazing on a 1 second cast, it just sucks to lose it at 60 being on a 1 second cast for 40 levels. If you went deep resto and dipped 7 into enhance, that would be doable for a few phases until you collected some gear to respec to 30/0/21.
---
tryharding temporary content OMEGALUL
---
Damn right!
---
That's exactly the point of the thread. Besides the 'smart'.
---
Although advertising is great, what happens when there's gamebreaking bugs on launch that someone who wasn't invited might have found? That great PR turns to negative PR.
---
At the level your discussing the only cc that was very powerful was sheep and fear, fear you could damage through sheep you couldn’t. Warlock played right was still a monster 1v1. Not many classes had a stun that early, rogues and Druid, but if your an orc that hardly worried you. Plus dots basically screwed stealth. I think you honestly just didn’t realize class potential till the 40s cause lock is one of the stronger world pvp classes. Hunter is the hard counter but hunter much counters everything pre 60
---
It was just an example. A poor example.
---
As I said, I don't care for the pet names. If it makes you happy, I hope they allow it.
---
Oh cool.  I guess we both just missed the part where Ion explains how they will merge the layers when there is still 20k people on the server.
---
I'll roll a Feral for Classic(most likely, but not yet decided for certain), also for endgame raiding. Tanking isn't anywhere close to being bad, Druids even have the best TPS(Threat per second) and are superior to Warrior on a few bosses even. As a 3rd/4th tank, i can DPS also and Feral DPS might not be top notch, but u can beat rogues especially early in classic + u provide a 3% crit Buff. The only problem is, that u don't do cleave DMG, that makes Druids DPS just as good as the rogues one and Warriors will obviously be ahead because of that.
---
I highly doubt Blizzard runs their servers from those countries. They more likely run their servers from their head quarters.
---
Give him a break, knowledge of a 15 year old game is all this dude has
---
Not sure how you got that from my comment
---
Wonder what arguments people will have against that... They're gonna say indicating quests is for retail kids, but then immediatly download an add-on for that...
---
Which side are you applying for? One side if free, the other we charge a little bit.
---
I have this in the form of a puzzle - I've recently put all pieces together and framed it. Currently it's hanging on my wall as a painting. I love it!
---
I am making a second post addressing this. Yes i think people are chasing a particualar feeling and the main reason classic doesn't feel the same is that players were trash during vanilla and now the tuning is too low (not because blizz got it wrong, classic is 100% accurate with 1.12 regarding mob values) BUT i believe many changes that happened during patches 1.1 thru 1.12 hugely affected the percepted difficulty by constantly buffing player classes and items while i bet blizz did not touch the creatures in leveling dungeons and what we are seeing is 1.12 players and items versus 1.0 tuned creatures.
---
1.12 is naxx patch so expect everything before that to be way easier, and the earlier you go the more apparent it is.
---
and you'll only use 4 frequently ! amazing :)
---
Condors in Westfall have screech
---
Have they rolled out any new builds with a list of fixes?  Why do you say they are fixing things?
---
i will always up vote gravity falls memes
---
Show the money
---
I don't agree with you, for various reasons other people told you.
---
Take my upvote for the effort and not for my personal opinion on this topic!
---
We should support discussions like this and not just downvote because we think differently.
---
Have you even seen gameplay of the beta? There are so many things that needs fixing, and new fixes bring new bugs that needs to be discovered and then fixed again. I am actually starting to worry about whether or not the game will be ready in 90 days.
---
Stuck between Mage/Shaman/Hunter
---
I’ll mainly be playing solo on alliance and I would like a class that is strong in world pvp. I started playing at the end of Vanilla and mained a warlock throughout TBC. 
---
Here are my perceived issues with the classes:
---
Mage - too cooldown reliant, overpopulation, ugly af
---
Warlock- immobile, countered by undead, oom quickly
---
Hunter - huntard, overpopulation, lack diversity in talents 
---
Let me know what you guys think!
---
Do you mean raiding as an elemental shaman dps, or do you mean raiding as an elemental shaman who is filling a healing spot.
---
As a dps, you're garbage, the absolute worst raiding spec in the game. However you can still bring value as a healer since chain heal and totems are amazing. You may get some pressure to respec mana tide during progression, but extra totems are in such demand that you can get away without mana tide most of the time. You might question if it's worth it though since most guilds won't give you caster gear, which leaves you competing for the limited amount of gear designed for elemental and balance. 
---
People are saying that guilds will just take any warm bodies they can find, but those are shit guilds. Every single guild I remember running with both during vanilla live and private server was benching people on raid night. The only guilds who just need warm bodies are dying guilds.
---
This is by far the most extensive and accurate hunter guide I have seen in some time
---
https://youtu.be/tOcqrIfi0qI
---
Here's hoping!
---
What nerfs/stealth nerfs are you referring to?
---
basically i'm just here for the news about classic. The community is just a bunch of elitist autists
---
Play what you love!  Also when you do get to 60 tanks will be in demand and getting a group for a dungeon will be that much easier.  There will be a lot more people in your "pack" than you think.
---
Dwarf female with the long braided hair has one of the best casting animations ever made. I'd suggest picking something you enjoy looking at, because you might be playing that character for a while, but to me nothing beats the helicopter hair of the dwarf female.
---
What makes the them useless?
---
&gt; You don't say....
---
Meaning Bear tanks would be alright in my book. I am pretty sure Bear tanks are a no-go for min-maxer groups.
---
It will not.
---
Relax dude. It's pretty clear that was hyperbole...
---
I'd love to have all unfinished zones available in classic with quests, mobs, npcs and some bases that are scales for classic levels: Uldum, mount hyjal, ghostlands, eversong woods and Gilneas. I don't care about any new gear or new raids and dungeons that much. I'd just love to have a classic version of the wow where I could walk where ever I want in Kalimdor and Easter Kingdoms and there would be something other than just wilderness
---
The differences between classic and his private server i imagine.
---
I just want to point out, that there is no warrior in the raid (maybe the 3 offline), and the paladin got the shield, so I guess a paladin tanked.
---
Thanks. Mis-quoted you. Basically you mean at a higher loyalty rating, his loyalty had further to fall before you had to worry about it, meaning you could go longer without feeding, right?
---
LULW
---
All the nerfs and stealth nerfs but for example we can take the nerf to Cthuns tentacles ground rupture.
---
People export what they find. The amiubt of bugs up to level 10 is very little computer to what is probably still there at levels 30-60.  
---
You cant just go there and find bugs, and 10 bugs can literally take weeks. If you want to host that event, go ahead.
---
Sometimes the internet is amazing :)
---
I was searching for a wow classic playlist on Spotify and didn't expect much. Then I started playing yours and the first song that came on (Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold) put a huge smile on my face and instantly put me in the good old WoW mood. 
---
And now I find this Reddit thread and your username. So thanks for making this playlist. Can't wait until August 27th.
---
1440p 165hz, baby.

---
You realize that many gaming companies work just like that? Do you think steam doesnt have adjusted prices for many many countries?  Of course they do. Regional pricing is a thing, blizz just doesnt care.
---
You might be, the two play very differently. Mages have more ways to do damage and more mobility. Shadow priests are straightforward, brutal, and effective. You don't have the mobility of the mage but you are far tankier, kinda like a SL lock but with better damage. Spriests also bring more group support in the form of dispel and bubbles, particularly horde side where you're the only offensive dispeller. Honestly it's a hard question to answer, made harder by the fact that spriest doesn't really come into their own until 40, so you can't really just level to 20 to get a feel for the play style.
---
The game will definitely be released on the launch day. Activision won't risk pushing the launch day back after this amount of coverage and PR. The concern is the state of which the game will be launched I guess. Currently there's been a positive reaction from players on the Beta it seems, but like you say, there's a lot more hidden bugs out there. :)
---
Well, classic hat a lot of bugs as well and it would be a shame if they remove all the gliches and stuff.
---
Rather than a retail QoL, something that could have been great :
---
A way to learn a pet skill without taming them. It doesn't feel great to free one of your pet just to tame a random one to learn it's skill and free it afterward.
---
You already have the tame skill, how about something similar to learn the skill without giving up a pet in stable ?
---
It is true that there is no AH but it can still be quite helpful to have an alt just sitting next to a Mailbox and bank to send your stuff to early on - especially if you want to get ahead of the pack. You of course have to later run that (or a different alt) to a main City anyway...
---
I and multiple other People have found this advise quite helpful - if it's not for you then it's just not.
---
Thank you my man!
---
What makes you think you can provide better feedback then a streamer with 60k people watching them?
---
Thanks. I've learnt that you can DE any gear from Level 1 Enchanting, so I'm going to take that on my bank alt who I send any gear for selling to. Means I can keep my 2nd Prof slot for a 'real' prof on my main.
---
Good to know, thanks
---
downvoted.
---
Yeah its stupid, especially things like cast bars which significantly impacts the game and gives massive advantages to those who have those kind of addons.
---
And its not like you can use the arguments "addons were in vanilla!!!" either because modern client, and modern addons are much more powerful than the shit that was in vanilla, altough I would say even those were problematic.
---
Ok you sold me man i will play ret either as main or as second alt when classic hits
---
I assume they would run servers in a few areas.  You wouldn't want your EU servers in the US for instance.
---
Only 600$ xD I wish man
---
I can get a root from these boars, eh?
---
Nah it’s there, it’s just harder to see bcuz of the bit size
---
I munch on carrots and kettle corn. I drink coffee or sip whiskey.
---
Beta characters will not transfer. All toons, items, gold, achievements, etc are lost once the beta ends. This is consistent across all games.
---
For speccing that deep into Enhancement all a group of 5 gets is ~ 10-20 dps, not worth the investment.
---
1 big streamer invite = 60k people watching for bugs while maintaining a small number of players in the beta.
---
Itemization and skill trees were less than ideal for hybrids. Ele Shaman was my favorite spec in TBC, but in Classic PvE you're going to struggle.  You'll also end up wearing lots of cloth.
---
In PvP, you should do fine.
---
I never said I personally would. I'm saying there's a lot more players in the community who don't stream who are much more involved with the Vanilla WoW scene than some of those in the Beta.
---
No Wailing Caverns was truly a different beast to most early dungeons. Incredibly easy to wipe, hellishly long but with good rewards. 
---
Most of Classic's dungeons are amazing and interesting. BRD will always have a special place in my heart as probably the most fun to do, but the sheer size of it killed groups by halfway.
---
So I don't need to feel like a scrub for only being 5/15 Vanilla Naxx? Thanks OP!
---
Yeh
---
There is a countdown timer on the battle.net page for the 15th anniversary collector's edition. Look at the [bottom of the page](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080).
---
Esfand proved on stream that it's possible to get crit while sitting to force proc buffs (like reckoning). It's just much harder and timing-based now.
---
motorbike wow u must be an alpha male
---
Negatron
---
RBG
---
I have taken so many breaks in between the years that I am still a noob for anything raid related. My time in vanilla was spent in Warsong Gulch and fighting Horde in westfall. I feel like that's all I ever did.
---
So sweet. Thanks 😍😍
---
This is the primary effect of the hype train.
---
whether it is good or not is irrelevant, good or bad is a personnel point of view. If it is "popular" then the demand is there. Which is this case will mean TBC will come.
---
You ok? Need help?
---
9 - white beard, bald.
---
For damage, a fire mage with pyroblast.
---
For healing,  I think a druids healing touch.
---
Most of your cp comes from WSG wins and not HKs. More winning = more CP. So its part skill. Good players and premades will get more CP faster.
---
Yeah, just giving my experience in aggregate.
---
I think you couldn´t find anything because the earlier Posts got deleted. 
---
It is just such a - I don´t want to Sound mean - question to most People that have played MMORPG's for a while :p
---
But they don´t - unlike Hearthstone or HOTS beta you don´t get to Keep anything :/
---
These were amazing.
---
Would hope they expand upon classic instead of layering expansions on top of each other.
---
potato quality because its the only video i could find with them all
---
Lol yeah the bear that sat on the mailbox
---
Yeah that’s true it gives the potential of having a lot of people looking for bugs. But 60k people aren’t watching to find bugs in reality. Way higher chance someone will find something with that many people watching though. 
---
This may have been a reason they put the spotlight on streamers but I doubt it. If they had it their way, exploits and bugs would be reported confidentially and fixed quickly, not viewed by te entire world.
---
Then they should do Cata as well.
---
Ok, will be interesting to see how many "non-streamers" get a mention when they take the top spot.
---
Yeah that shouldn't be too much of an issue. I'll probably have to add something like that anyway with the different hunter bar animations people want.
---
Yeah i did start like a month after vanilla release but i was such a scrub… (14 yo me)
---
Was leveling my Warlock by putting my tallent point randomly because the abilities seemed cool.
---
was playing with not optimal pets or gear by clicking on spells. 
---
Even like that i saw MC BWL and AQ20 (first half of AQ40) but honestly had little idea what was going on, people would tell me ok just dont stand there and when the dragon do this GTFO from the raid.
---
And i was happily spaming shadow bolt.
---
Alsmost everyone i played with had no idea of in depth class mechanics and since there was little to non media coverage (aka YouTube "OMG Best tallent OP OP DMG meta build" ) everyone in my experience were rolling with the flow and/or experimenting a bit.
---
Also was dirt poor so the only times i tried new tallent tree was when we got a free respec from blizzard after a major patch
---
ps: took me 4month IRL to lvl to 60
---
I mean the beta testing seems to be going really well regardless if it's true vanilla might be easier than pservers.
---
All I hear about is how much fun it is to feel more compelled to talk to people for help/fun.
---
Yep, that is my concern. Release will be 27th, obviously, could have worded it a little better I guess. \^\^
---
&gt; When it comes to the coordination I actually don't think it exceeds Jaina preperations at all
---
My main concern is that you need an army of crafters leveling alongside the raid team to throw them a ton of consumables. It's not like with Jaina where they can just go billions of gold in debt and buy materials and consumables from multiple servers. And in the case of Jaina, the team had weeks (if not months) to prepare in advance. That time is just not there on a fresh server. No one has any gold. No one has any materials.
---
That is what I meant with coordination. It's not the raid team + a few people gathering supplies. This time, the group gathering needs to be greater than the raid team itself ... **significantly**.
---
I am still sceptical it can be pulled off in the first ID, but I am happy to be wrong on this one of course :)
---
Mages are great but if you are looking at priest just make sure you get into a guild and make it known that you are THE shadow priest. It'll be harder to get raiding spots than mages BUT the biggest thing is most casual guilds just want 40 people instead of worrying about best raid set up.
---
An eternity.
---
Agreed
---
i would say gbanks and summoning stones
---
APES have traditionally been zerging the PvP brackets early, not PvE. Maybe this time since honor won't be on live on launch.
---
Also curious about this.
---
I have the same memory, starting from Maraudon &amp; Sunken Temple there was a steep increase in difficulty. Unless you had either a specialized tank or healer you had to be more careful or the heal would run out of mana.
---
At the moment no, once I add the hunter bar, the range bar will be a cake walk.
---
Look at the paladins! Are they healing in this raid, but walking around in what seems to be protection gear? At least the shield looks to be from the last boss.
---
The problem is the number of people online at the same time, the likelihood of having 20K people online at the same time after the release rush is lower which is all the point of being capable of handling load, the problem is spikes in connections, not necessarily number of connections.
---
You just need to inform yourself about computer science now, go on, show more of your ignorance, I'm waiting.
---
Don't forget to fish for crits!
---
I think you're forgetting all of the people *not* streaming the game with thousands of viewers. 
---
Classic was already a game, we don't need a beta for normal reasons like content testing. This is entirely a technical beta that honestly requires people to just play the game. 
---
Also, streamers are great at testing weird shit. Kiting a dragon all the way to SW and seeing the city leaders not attack is a bug. Also a 100+ person PVP fight with said dragon showed that the servers can handle large scale PVP fights, unlike retail.
---
I had a mage back in vanilla then switched to rogue in mid tbc. 
---
Been playin same rogue for 12 years. So glad that i’ll be able to experience vanilla again with my rogue. 
---
Its like wishes come true..
---
&gt; Thanks, you're the change the world needs.
---
I was taken in in a guild at the start of Legion that followed a similar principle. Had so much fun in Nighthold that I can write books about it. Just returning the favor :)
---
That's correct. I think there were very few if any of the first people to hit 60 that were warriors. Only ones that comes to mind is Argajev and Enigma and they're not there. 
---
Angus was a priest and Kiray a hunter. Can't remember Lirielle but my hunch is telling me mage.
---
Since you want a warrior and a shaman, I would pair them together : the warrior will be insane with windfury totem.
---
This is why I am also avoiding pservers. 
---
My time will come.
---
Everything higher than me as a fury warrior at lvl 20.
---
You realize Blizzard admitted at Blizzcon that the 1.12 data they have has holes in it. There are lots of bugs that have come from reviving very old archived data.
---
We absolutely need beta for content testing.
---
Account sharing isn’t against ToS if you share with your family.
---
They're keeping some small bugs in I believe. Just to relive the actual experience.
---
Transmog, barber shop, hybrid dps specs being useful, lightning bolt animation, dual spec, guild bank...I’ll miss a lot of things but all of that together doesn’t equal the immersion and community of what vanilla provided.
---
I wonder if this guy remembers this post. 
---
He was probably just some horny 14-year-old at the time.
---
Not at all what I meant to insinuate. Blizzard has nerfed a lot of the content over the lifespan of classic. Some very easily verifiable by the patch notes.
---
Blizzard have said they will have new realm names.
---
Well, I do play a Tauren shaman so...I dont know
---
That's an argument against closed beta testing in general, not just the PR element of this closed beta test.
---
Fact is that when Blizzard invites people without checking qualifications they're not expecting great testers, they're just expecting players in all their variety. This has been Blizzards MO since _at least_ TBC (I got in to that beta, no qualifications required), and streamers don't really change that. They're players at the end of the day, with the added benefit of serving marketing of the game.
---
Wdym fastest to lvl10 ?
---
 I'll once again spend 2H trying to log between 1:00 to 3:00 AM, realise it was a mistake and fall asleep feeling empty and betrayed.
---
Stress test experience at its finest
---
Pretty much this. Un subbed from BFA a month or so after it came out. Now I'm playing BFA because every other game is boring while I'm sitting waiting for classic.
---
Smart. I played Vanilla Beta on my dad's account wayy back and made my own on Launch Day in 2004. I got Classic Beta on my own account but only put in maybe 4 hours or so so far.
---
Plus an acorn as mats you had to carry around. And the mats changed for every rank of the rez, so you had to buy new ones every time you get an uprank or keep your old ones and waste more than 1 bag slot for br rez mats
---
Yeah, I think Krondor and Morghus tanked, so Krondor got the shield as Druids don't use shields :p
---
I would say enjoying, enjoying life :)
---
It should, Blizzard considers absorbs 'misses' and it resets on misses with some special handling for parties.
---
There won't be anywhere near as many servers as there used to be, so it's not likely that everyone will have their server names again, if they use them at all.
---
good points around here.
---
I'm almost 100% sure I had this as a desktop background back in the day. It looks so freakishly familiar.
---
The awesome raids. One of the few things that i still think is awesome in BFA, is the raid- and boss designs.
---
Most of what streamers are doing is for entertainment purposes but there is a lot of quality testing going on. For instance, when they dragged that raid boss through stormwind to undercity, and they raid boss despawned on the way. They are doing a lvling challenge. They are having a duel tournament. A lot of them are doing professions. Hunters had a bug that they couldn’t auto attack if they used a melee attack, they found a work around and spread the info. All of that is valuable info. And some of them are even making YT vids on that stuff. 
---
Blizzard is not dumb, I doubt the streamers and the general public were on the same list for beta invites. Especially since some streamers who never played wow before got beta.
---
My old pet might be dead by now. I left him in the twisting nether and he probably forgot about me anyway if he's still alive.
---
its a different client with different servers
---
they could name them the same but they wont
---
its confusing having 2 servers with the same name even if one is retail and the other classic
---
Shadow priest is completely fine for dungs and is a facemelter in PvP. You run out of mana pretty fast in raids tho and you are useful mostly for your op debuffs. You compete for sh DMG gear with warlocks, which might be painful. (Although your guild might cherish you so much to gear you up first so that you are not demotivated by your low dps)
---
I'm playing a private server now just to get used to the early-game quests so I don't run around like a headless chicken during the zerg.
---
so from "piss off private -server players, you got it too easy and know nothing" we moved to "holy shit private server players were facing harder dungeons than original retail classic players back then"
---
It will be my first mission in WoW now, excellent for leveling.
---
&gt; who are much more involved with the Vanilla WoW scene
---
Care to provide an example?
---
YEAH ASMON IS JUST GONNA REPORT 5000 VIDEOS OR SO ON YOUTUBE
---
GOOD IDEA
---
I'm stuck between Priest, Shaman and Paladin for PvE.
---
That rep grind can be completed by aoe-farming elementals in Silithus. Takes about 4 hours.
---
Goodbye. You won't be missed.
---
&gt; reported confidentially and fixed quickly
---
How so? a report is a report, doesnt matter if the guy is a streamer.
---
Nothing beats taking another 4 fellow paladins at level 20 and going on an adventure to earn this hammer
---
thanks bro
---
For... Uhmmm.... Testing? so that all players can experience a nearly bugfree re-release?
---
You can only DE things which are boe. If you're planning to do DM / Mara runs you can't send the most items to your alt.
---
Well if it’s planning....isn’t that kind of prior by default? You know because you do it before the thing you are planning? Hmmm...
---
I was showing it in BfA because, as you guessed, I'm not in the beta but Asmond is using version 2.0. I haven't heard any bad news so I'm assuming it works.
---
You must be very young.
---
Except for level 5 minimum to learn the profession at all
---
&gt;most people won’t either.
---
wow! you can read others people mind and see the future!
---
Pretty sure its 00:00 my local time, which is 8 and half hours from this comment
---
You dont need most(if any) of those consumables... You needed them back in the day because we quite literally sucked at the game. Just play better.
---
I would love for that to happen.
---
Except they've already mentioned free transfers in that context for Classic.
---
You can unlock up to 300 on gathering proffesions I believe, saw a few streamers get it.
---
Get mining!
---
I did the same for the same reason.
---
You counter points are all of our positive points
---
Do whatever's fun, life is short anyway. This is cool and isn't less meaningful than, say, an average 9-5 office job (I know my job is meaningless at least).
---
Will launch start everyone over?
---
Ahem. Sir, may I drop this here? https://youtu.be/J7DN_w0LQUI
---
I've always been open to bringing suboptimal stuff for classic raids, given that most if it is going to be a lot easier than we remember. But this is really neat. I'm hoping to get into a position of some authority in a casual raiding guild so I can advocate for fun builds like this.
---
Much of the vanilla dungeon difficulty also came from large level swings from the initial boss to the end boss. I recall BRD having a particularly wide range from the Interrogator to the Emperor. Which is why clearing it took forever and rarely did a single group clear all bosses. You'd roll through the prison area as level 49-53 only to come up against level 58 bosses and elites near the end.
---
warrior execute crit is up there but obviously requires an already low health target. 
---
mage crit pyroblast with arcane power is tough to beat.  PoM for another instant pyroblast is an amazing combo that is so fast it might as well be considered a 1 shot on a lot of targets.
---
I think its too well written and structured for a 14 year old
---
I have a month and 4 days left between release and the next year in uni
---
I wasn't born in the EU, so im not as smart as you.  Thank you for stooping down to my level to explain these issues to my simple peasant mind.
---
You seem to be in the "lots of players will quit so the problem will take care of itself" camp.  Assuming your wrong and players actually join after signup, what can high end computer science geniuses like yourself do to correct this problem?
---
I started playing WoW in Vanilla, but never reached lvl 60. My vanilla experience was mostly:  
---
* First char: Human warrior: leveled that one to 19, lost a duel to a hunter and deleted the char
---
* 2nd: Human Paladin: Leveled that one to lvl 34, took a break and my whole server got a free migration to another realm. So, when I got back I started over on the new realm (where my friends was).
---
* 3rd: NE Druid: Leveled that one to 38. Deleted it, because I wanted a rogue.
---
* 4th: NE Rogue: Leveled that one to lvl 18. Got in a dispute with my friends, got mad and started a UD Rogue to gank them with.
---
* 5th: UD Rogue: Leveled that one to lvl 24. Made up with my friends and figured out that I needed to go back to alliance in order to play with them.
---
* 6th: Gnome Mage: Leveled that one to 46. Took a break with WoW when my interest in Counter Strike got re-ignited  
---
Then TBC came out, and it wasn't before late TBC/early Wrath I leveled my first char to max level. A UD Mage. So, for me I get to experience (hopefully) the post lvl 60 vanilla for the first time :)
---
Command and conquer also rollercoaster tycoon otherwise it checks out
---
Yes bro! My tauren warrior tanked with Maladath as well! You had better gear than me, but I had full T2 and AQ40 gear.
---
You're incredibly naive if you think things can only be for one reason and therefore the scary corporation is just cutting costs.
---
Things can achieve multiple goals. Server density dropping off has plagued WoW for 15 years, as have launch day over-populations/queues/crashes. Layering solves all of these, hypothetically.
---
Imagine spending 4-5 hours acquiring this weapon when it's replaced at level 23 by a green lmao
---
Well compared to mythic raiding or m+, vanilla raids and dungeons look anything but challenging... especially with the revelation that elites are hitting less than people remembered.
---
OK Bye, while I'm having lots of fun this summer you can continue to struggle to find 5 people for M+. Or maybe you can go back to playing Anthem??? LUL.
---
I feel sorry for you, OP. A lot of people don't seem to read your post and just make up in their imagination what your post is about. lol
---
Hey all, I’m definitely playing Horde with some buddies, but am torn on what class to play. I’m leaning to Tank Warrior but is the time/gold sink that much bigger than the other classes? I’m not going super hardcore, but want to be able to raid eventually (MT or OT doesn’t matter to me) without falling behind as I didn’t put in the extra hours I just don’t have any more. Thanks guys!
---
Thats true, didnt think of the competition for tankning spots. I want a crack at getting thunderfury and if that means i need engi then so be it, I might find mining equally relaxing to herbalism anyway. Gonna suck on the economic side though :(
---
Nightelf mohawk. YYEEAA
---
Stuck between Hunter/Mage/Priest:
---
Priest - my first main, played a lot of priest from TBC through Wrath and most all of my raiding was during Wrath.
---
Mage - my main during Legion. Never raided but loved the class fantasy.
---
Hunter - never played, a bit undecided if I think I’ll love the hunter pet “minigame” or if I’ll just find it annoying to maintain pet happiness.
---
My goals: fun leveling experience (not going to fly through this part by any means), world PvP, BGs, dungeons, and then raiding more or less in that order of priority. Going to be decently casual at least to start so most likely won’t get too many regular raiding days in.
---
If my friends were going to go Horde, I’d probably be a shaman.
---
Totally agree... and the hypocrisy of people, blaming retail for everything being easy, and then grabbing add-ons making Vanilla easy
---
Seems that way.
---
See you later!
---
There has been private Servers for a Long time. People have played classic for 8+ years on end. And their "Nostalgia" never died down.
---
There is several Videos of People saying they thought the same but got convinced otherwise through the beta alone. 
---
There is several threads saying the same you said. And nobody really cares. Even if it is nostalgia just let People have their fun. If it only is nostalgia to them they will still have a good time in the beginning and they won´t loose out.
---
Wait, you can't be reasonable, that's illegal.
---
I disagree. I would guess that during vanilla WoW was about 80% of the populations first MMORPG.
---
Today I would say the number of WoW Classic being peoples first MMORPG is probably 15% maybe less.
---
People will be more knowledgeable of the game this time around but whether that direcetly translates to being "better" I'm not sure.
---
Oh man you just must be an R1 Blizzcon champ with such logic.
---
Quick, ask him for lottery numbers!
---
Bro I was reading thru his shit like 
---
“Nah you don’t understand, this is exactly the stuff I miss”
---
Just imagine the shit storm if this was a thing :D.
---
I wouldn’t play most likely beta even if I could.
---
Done all kind of stuff ingame billion times, and to burn out and invest time into beta character? Waste of time.
---
Then dont play it.
---
&gt;remind me when was the last time you played a game with 40 real people who all have to work together, keep boss mechanics and their own character in mind? 
---
This weekend on a private server. 
---
Excluding private servers, 2014, ArcheAge, quite a lot more than 40 players. 
---
&gt;do you remember how difficult it was to talk to random people,
---
Difficult? 
---
&gt;create a guild, build a static and find a time where all 40 people are available for 2 hours max?
---
I just joined one. As did 97.5% of raiders.
---
&gt; if you are on a pvp server you will most certainly die on the way to the raid entrance multiple times.
---
Looking forward to it! If someone brings enough players to stop a 40 man raid on its way to an instance that sounds *way* more fun than just raiding!
---
yeah maybe if you didnt get one or two shot by a rogue from stealth  :p
---
I was 14 years old. I was a noob. Didn't use key bindings before raiding BWL - and then only keybinding on renew, flash heal and greater heal. I keyboard turned.
---
When I look back I can't believe I wasn't kicked from my guild. I can't believe I went for the correct builds or completed some of the questlines.
---
I raided onyxia, MC, BWL, AQ, ZG and first few bosses in Naxx. Full tier 2 set and benediction. I was always broke and only got epic mount cuz of a mate giving me the gold for it.
---
A lot of the reason for me getting a spot in raid was that I was the only dwarf priest in the guild - and one of the few on the server. I even wiped our 40 man raid 3 times on the night we took down Nefarian as my PC would bluescreen during the fight - no fear ward - tank feared - raid wiped.
---
Have you tested that parry haste is being tracked correctly on classic? I can do some testing for you if needed.
---
&gt;It's only an issue for a few weeks after launch. They need the layers to prevent traffic jams and ragequits.
---
Perfectly okay for blizzard to think that and you to believe that... and when we are 6 weeks into launch and there are still servers with all 3,4,5,6 layers full?
---
Certainly they aren't going to merge them, and the aren't going to make new servers and move those layers to their own server.
---
What then?
---
I just don't buy into "once the population stabalizes" and that only taking "weeks"
---
Layering will be here to stay for months.
---
Unless they make changes prior to launch.
---
Your are right a large group of people will not play classic, but some people will play it. 
---
Having something that can fill the down time between content on retail seems like a good thing to me. Giving people more for their 15 dollars a month is always a good thing. I may not play it, but I am glad it will exist for those who do want that experience.
---
&gt; but the way they’re handling Classic feels like a step in the right direction.
---
Which is exactly why it's happening like it is. They NEED the good PR, the goodwill from the playerbase. Its hard to say in these situations how valuable the move then is, but I believe its a win for the playerbase regardless. If handling things better makes more money and is better for players, who cares if they're only doing it for the money?
---
The people who have played Vanilla on emulated servers for the last 15 years and now about their classes inside and out. People who have levelling routes for speed running to 60, testing all the quests work as expected. People who grinded the PvP to rank 14 when Vanilla was around, and those who raided consistently throughout the era. 
---
Streamers aren’t gods, they don’t know Vanilla inside and out. Please stop thinking viewer counts mean they’re more knowledgeable on the game.
---
Thanks everyone, appreciate the swift response. :)
---
Accessibility of information is a huge factor. There are now endless resources through wowhead, icyveins, reddit, YouTube, etc where you can read, watch, or ask anything you need. That alone is going to make people better on average.
---
If it starts at the same time as the last one, it's more like 11 and half hours from now.
---
Tanks do, but not everyone.
---
If you're a tank trying to reposition a dragon it's pretty important to know beforehand if the tail end will or will not suddenly be whipping around to the rogues on either flank.
---
&gt; Just play better.
---
If you say that this enough to carry &lt;35 players with sub pre-raid BiS gear through MC then alright. :)
---
We will see if that is true :)
---
Stress test starts 5PM EST.
---
Fucking yikes
---
I think it was my favourite in PvP too but I never got one to cap! Thanks for the advice!
---
Why play games at all? If you finish a SP you'll probably never touch it again. How about playing multiplayer ranked games? You loose all your progress at the end of season. Why live? You die anyway. See where i'm going with this?
---
Do you know how long does it take to re-spawn? I remember I spent hours researching and calculating the respawn timer years ago, and I got the correct timer but I couldn't remember it anymore.
---
I mean content testing in a *fun* sense. People are already playing the game, and combing through everything available. There are also months before release, just give it time
---
The goal of these stress tests is literally in the name. Just by logging in you’ve done your job.
---
Warlock
---
Too allieviate some of your concerns regarding in Hunter; in polls on this subreddit hunters have placed quite low in popularity. Now I'm sure the reality will look quite different, but in the try-hard community it looks like Hunter is fairly unpopular. Even placing lower than Warlock.
---
Best of luck, see ya on the battlefield!
---
lueshi huh
---
Dude, don’t loop bears in with Oomkins.  Bears are better than warriors in some situations, and running a bear means the “trash” gear is useful.
---
My feels
---
Even if fury pvp isnt great with a 2hander its not bad at all. 20/31/0 with a good 2hander its pvp viable, not optimal but cant everything right.
---
Which I addressed in my OP. I'm not expecting an instant change, I mentioned we have 3 months, I'd like to see a shift in invites when more waves go out.
---
g a t e k e e p i n g
---
Seeing as you can't give a single more specific example, I doubt you'd notice them being there/not there anyways.
---
&gt;The worst is the chat and how they try to laugh about soda who absolutely wrecked 7 people with his mate. Its not that anybody is an absolute highlight or a noob in this clip. Its just a good fight but people cant stop hating other streamers just because theyre in someone elses chat. I hate those kids.
---
Have you seen this thread? Everyone is just flaming and shitting on everybody. This subreddit is no different than twitch chat, it might even be more toxic.
---
&gt; The people who have played Vanilla on emulated servers for the last 15 years and now about their classes inside and out.
---
Esfand is a streamer who played vanilla and a lot of emulated servers
---
&gt; people who have levelling routes for speed running to 60,
---
Joana is a streamer and has world record.
---
&gt; People who have created emulated servers to mimic the authentic blizzlike experience. 
---
&gt; People who have tested hundreds of servers launching and failing.
---
The dudes from nostalrius is a streamer and is in beta
---
Did you think about opening the blue post about the test?
---
Dude...this mace is _literally_ always talked about in any Paladin leveling discussion. Tons of people have talked about it, including myself. If I roll pally, you best fucking believe I'm making 3-4 Pally buddies at level 18-19, with the singular goal of getting this mace the moment we ding 20. It's best in slot weapon till like 30+.
---
Yes but not every class relies so heavily on pet damage which literally doesn’t scale at all. Their damage falls off in PvE which means they obviously fall off a bit in PvP as well. Are they viable? Yes. OP wasn’t asking for viability he was asking which class performs best and at which gear brackets. Hunter is not a TOP class past probably tier 2. Even then it’s meh. Again, not to say they aren’t viable or still very scary in the top hands but they are by no means killing clothies in 5 seconds at end game gear.
---
I'm in similar position, but want to PvP more than raid. I recall way more rogues in vanilla.. or was that just because I was one?
---
I'm calling the police
---
In the immortal words of Homer j. Simpson
---
"if something is hard to do, it's not worth doing"
---
But for the rest of os, some of the most memorable moments in gaming was during vanilla wow, it had something the expansions didn't, that's why hundreds of thousands of people registered at Nostalrius.
---
But you do you.
---
Ah, good to know - thanks. Well now I'm not sure! No idea about DM / Mara runs. Never done them, but keep reading that Hunters are good for farming gold (2nd to mages, I read?), so can probably afford to have 2 crafting profs and simply farm gold to buy mats rather than gather the mats ourselves.
---
Use fucking Tyrion Lannister to promote classic wow
---
Oh man, I giggled.
---
Private servers were mainly for sad basement dwelling alt-righters that couldn’t afford retail.
---
I think the consensus is to go ele resto and gear up through healing while using the same build to blow people up in PvP. That’s my plan at least. Chain heal spam is kind of appealing for all the wonderful green numbers.
---
What reality do you live in? This mace lasts you until early 30's..sometimes even to mid 30's.
---
Oh there were a shitload of rogues, too. Haha
---
I literally wanted to port the popular weapon swing timer from vanilla private servers. I tried contacting the creator and didn't hear back so I decided to make my own because I wanted more out of it.
---
Whenever I wanted to do something I would just Google 'thing I wanted to do wow api' and a surprising amount of stuff was available from old posts. 
---
There were also some playlists on YouTube to get started with but they weren't that great (maybe I should make one?)
---
Also my code is open source so you can see how I did things. (Just don't look too deep or the abyss with stare back into you)
---
What I would suggest is pick a simple add-on that  has been abandoned and revive it. My first version of WST was very close to the add-on I was replicating, just with a target bar as well.
---
Even with the whole gurubashi babyrage fiasco? "You are banned from fun"  for stealing the chest from him yikes. Even permabanned anyone who mentioned it lmao.
---
 Entitled little bitch boy
---
Yeah, but the question is - will "most people" even play Classic?
---
Classic might be "easier" simply because it will have large population of good players. Casuals will play BfA.
---
This probably isnt something you should brag about my dude.
---
I did. I didnt know what pdt meant. So i came here to ask. Thought that was what reddit was for- asking things... no need to be rude
---
Ty!
---
Achievements? Transmog as well? Damn!
---
This. Flesh out vanilla in a vanilla way.
---
What actually needs fixing? All i've seen in this reddit so far is idiots claiming that the damage values are wrong because it felt a lot harder 15 years ago.
---
Not gonna lie, he has one of the most punchable faces. Second to Mr. Beast
---
I am extremely torn between the classes of my 3 main characters i played through the first 2 part. 
---
My background:
---
I played with some guys from university shortly after the start of vanilla (in EU) so it was April or May 2005. I played holy priest all the time, did a lot of dungeons at a low level as nobody wanted to heal (and priest is best anyways). We played allience, merge with another guild, build a a raid allience with 2 other guilds and raided MC and BWL.  I had my first pause during that time and the guild shifted more towards hardcore raiding (was already 3 days a week at start). The raid alliance merged, AQ40 and most of Naxx (if not all, not so much contact later)  and stayed a top raiding guild on Antonidas EU (shout outs to Venom, former Guardians of Light + Wappenbund). 
---
With parts of my guild I left the server and the allience, joined Arygos - EU servers Horde, we played more casual, ZG and a bit of AQ 20, I played Mage now (the seconds main) and it stayed this way until mid TBC. My mage got really good at jewel crafting and auction house use, when I stopped I had over 500k gold. I leveled a BE Paladina during TBC and she became my secondary main (tanking). I switched during WotLK starting with mage, then Pala, then started a priest and mained him, too. Whiched from casual raiding to more pug-like after WotLK and my interest died over Cata and MoP. It never came back.
---
Now: New Vanilla and still the class phantasies of mage, (holy) priest and (holy or prot) pala catch me most. Still a bit interested in WL. Prot pala is off the board for obvious reasons (no olololadin).
---
I will again not be alone, most likely a warrior will level with me.
---
I am really unsure what to play and also the depending proffessions. For Mage (or WL) i lean towards enchanting + tailoring while for Pala I lean towards alchemy + herbs. Priest could be both, maybe more the enchanting route, too. Not sure here, too.
---
My main focus will be most likely leveling, proffessions, dungeons + raids (in a max 2 times per week group).
---
I'll have to take a look at it today. Luckily it's open source so I don't have to guess how they did something.
---
and Jason Momoa just so more chicks play
---
I was thinking I'd play mage this time around, but then I remember back when I had a AQ/naxxgeared arms warrior in pvp..
---
I'm going to hate myself while leveling my warrior to 60 again, but damn.. I can't wait for endgame!
---
Had a 19 twink priest during classic i believe. Was getting 300 hp renew ticks. That plus my shields, yeah it was almost impossible to kill me.
---
Thanks for your input, as I said many people find female dwarves ugly and silly, I did too at one poont, but they are starting to grow on me.
---
Not sure how I feel about being an avatar of myself ingame, I never truly feel like it anyways.
---
i was a total n00b when i started vanilla. i hadn't played any major mmos other than maplestory (which is obv nothing like WoW). i made a bunch of mistakes in the beginning but had a blast trying weird builds and rotations, ended up learning a ton. enough to be able to raid, start a legit guild and have people come to me for advice, which for me, was a huge accomplishment.
---
They should learn from their mistakes and no force people to progress into another expansion, if they did this then their game wont fall apart again.
---
Do people forget that bracket twinking was a thing?
---
I started playing Vanilla a few week after launch all the way up until a few weeks before BC and never even had a character past level 30 because I loved rolling alts, was 13 years old and had no fucking clue what I was doing.
---
Class quests in general were amazing. I made alt after alt in vanilla just to see what kind of class quests they got up to 20ish.
---
Thats one way to look at it!
---
As a pvper you will kick yourself for not going for one of the good racials probably, I can't think of a worse race for a rogue than a night elf, orc stun resist and undead's wotf really stand out amongst the rest. Rogue pvp trinket does not remove stuns so if you get caught (say by a human with perception) or an orc rogue resists one of your stuns, you are toasted
---
Conjure water, conjure food and portal. Which one is the fourth?
---
Private servers are only a small fraction of wow. Retail has more horde and blizzards own poll has horde as the majority. Also classic beta has more horde currently.
---
Once you get your pet to loyalty level 6, it's not really a nuisance any more and it barely requires any food to stay happy. If that's the only thing worrying you about hunters, go for them. Fits your description of priorities extremely well, too.
---
According to streamers I watch (those dreaded streamers reeeee), it seems to be that updates are rolling out every few days, so actually very frequently. The last few are concerning hunter bugs, if I remember correctly.
---
The logical legacy servers are Classic/BC/Wrath, those were the expansions that grew sub numbers, rather than the modern boom and dip subs that come with each expac. 
---
That being said, I’m not worried that Blizzard will kill live WoW. It makes them too much money... even if Classic surpasses the traffic of live, the modern game has so many microtransactions that make up the meat of their income. 
---
What I am worried of, as preach said in his most recent video, is that Blizzard will turn retail into a “mobile game” kind of vibe even harder than it is now, because they have Classic to answer to that rpg driven demographic. They want to have both be options for *different* kinds of players and gamers, so they have a maximized net they can cast. 
---
But I still want to like the modern game. People said Legion was excellent, but it wasn’t for me, for so many reasons. I would play a modern expansion if it had some rpg flavor, and got rid of some of the more nagging issues of “retail”. But I’m afraid they have every reason to let the Classic trilogy fans have their game, and keep driving modern WoW in its own direction. 
---
Classic/BC/Wrath is going to dry up. Even if they do horizontal progression, *there is only so much they can add* before the game gets too cluttered, or people want to move onto a new experience as a whole. I’ll get a solid 5-8 years of joy out of these games, but I’m saddened that Blizzard will likely go into overdrive on the anti-rpg aspects of retail, and possibly do more to monetize it.
---
modern graphics are still better
---
My very first WoW experience was on a server in which only people from the net caffe were in it. I have no idea what kind of server this was (don't think there was actually internet in the "internet caffe"). I played a nelf rogue together with my 8 years old cousin and a friend of mine, we were both 12. We had absolutely no idea the fuck were we doing, I remember deleting my hearthstone because I couldnt vendor it, we didnt do any quests we just grinded mobs, I had another friend with a nelf warrior he was higher lvls then we were and my cousin was borrowing his char to come and help us :D. I also used 1 CP Evi's like a proper retard and of course managed to lvl 18 with 1h dagger only. Then the "net caffe" closed down and I moved to another, which had an account on retail, there was 5 of us playing on that account, I managed to get to 47 on retail as a human pala. I remember buying a 2h Mace from a vendor to wield, I also bought ankh thinking I could place it in the libram spot, and I was doing everything in dungeons, healing dps and tanking at the same time, but I was prot spec, I was sooo happy when I bought the Grim Reaper, the only blue I think I had. Like I think I was the nooobiest of noobs back then jesus christ. I stopped at lvl 47 and came back for TBC as a rogue, much improved I must say and was best during WotLK ICC progression got that ugly diving helm first on the server, good times.
---
Boi this ain't retail, Verigan's Fist in classic was BiS until like level 30 at least.
---
If I remember correctly, we had 1 spot total for a shadowpriest during raiding in vanilla. 
---
Elementalshamans didn't really work because of manaissues.
---
Someone please correct me if my memory is off!
---
Doubt most players are all that focused or interesting in testing as opposed to just treating it like a demo.
---
Ok it seems you're just looking for an argument, so I'm going to finish replying from here.
---
Joana wasn't invited the first time around, there were people on reddit petitioning for him to get in, he even mentioned this on the website and his YT account.
---
Nostalrius were always going to be invited as they were the ones who pretty much pushed Blizzard into launching the Classic Server. 
---
Esfand might have played Vanilla, and he might have played on Private servers. That's great, there's one person. 
---
I'm not saying all streamers aren't testing, if you would have read the OP you would see this. I'm not saying everyone who hasn't been invited has more experience. I'm not REALLY questioning Blizzard's decision. I'm trying to say that moving forward it would be good if more players got in rather than it looking like it's predominantly streamers. Streamers themselves have even said the PvP server has a clique on it, from a few key streamers basically pooling the whole server to do specific things, rather than allowing individuals to go about their way as they normally would without streamer presence. 
---
Feel free to pick more bits out to continue this discussion but we're going around in circles. If you fail to see the point of the OP, I'm not going to try and explain it further.
---
Tell that to the thousands of people that have regularly been playing private servers for years.
---
Never played wow but I like the art style combat and mechanics... I have a feeling the community will be strong and thats very important
---
So for me this will be my very first wow experience (I once lvled a char to 20 in retail but I dont count that)
---
I. Cant. Wait.
---
beautifully put.
---
I haven't seen any of that! All that's ever brought up in streams and classic discussion for me is the damn whirlwind axe lol.
---
god even running SM lib/arm yesterday on tbc private server was a pain not to wipe, i was trying to organize cc's, explain los and clean pulls but the tank didnt seem to understand the concept of that and insisted on running into each group regardless and not pulling them back away, pulling 2 more groups into the same fight. it was messy as fuck. if these kinda people are going to be on classic too then who knows you might be expecting too much competency from them
---
Well - there is no Point in People posting it here tbh... If they saw it in a stream and it didn´t get reported - fair enough they have a good Point to post it here.
---
In any other case why would you post it? Report it and get it fixed! If it was correct in the first place Blizzard will know.
---
I do get the Point though... But generalizing doesn´t help because not everyone is the way you described above :o
---
([Scribling intensifies])[https://i.postimg.cc/NFV92hvH/1554916498381.png]
---
Well there won't be another first #1 in the beta. The next "first #1" wont happen until phase 2 after release.
---
I played my human warrior as arms spec all the way to 60, people needed you to dl mods to  do raids so i was like "sack that" and literally just pvped, got to rank 7, had mostly blues and a purple zg helm and the unstoppable force, felt like a badass, but if i could compare how i play now to back then? I was a noob
---
12,000 hours, jfc dude...
---
Wow, after 14 years I still remember some of those names! Great realm, great people :-)
---
You wouldn’t at the level your talking about, unless you are getting ganked by a much higher level or you are fighting a Twink, neither of which will happen at release. Plus lock has health stone and soul stone. Like I said you are mis remembering low level pvp with a warlock or you didn’t know the class. Hunter was pretty much the only class locks struggled with at the level you previously mentioned.
---
&gt; The changes in 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 were all made to make outdated content more accessible for alts and casual players, yes.
---
And you don't see the problem here? You said it yourself: **"outdated content"**.
---
That should not happen. Content should not become outdated by patches. It shouldn't even become outdated by expansions.
---
They already stated that beta invites are winding down because they have plenty of players.
---
It says ©2004 Blizzard Entertainment. That does not mean the picture was made back in 2004. Seems like all the blunts have burned away your brain cells.
---
I remember being around 12 at the time doing dungeon runs with some 40 year old guy. He was always teaching me little things and was super nice. Looking back at the time he must have had a lot of patience to play with me when I was a little kid.
---
Or.if they do another stress test....
---
It'll be the ultimate irony that the wow killer is infact wow
---
Well, WoW has always been an easy game - it would not have been the juggernaut it was back in the day if it wasn't accessible for people to play.
---
This was my old Facebook profile pic!
---
Yep, you joined up and fought for however long you wanted. Come back next day and join the same AV!
---
After release date was given the private server I play on went from 3k active to 12k~ (11875) and has a queue during peak hours...I'd like to think you aren't alone.
---
How long has it been since you logged in? I couldn't find my old account
---
You absolutely should.
---
It's fucking hilarious.
---
Kripp really destroyed that man's mental well being when he beat him to world first Hardcore Inferno Diablo kill.
---
I miss mIRC :( 
---
Dont like this discord stuff
---
Yes this is legendary. I wish someone spent the time to make it move and change icons without changing the logo.
---
Been using wallpaper engine for a while now with vanilla wow areas and bosses. :P   
---
basically short gifs of zones and i can see mobs moving about... no players "yet" since the game hasnt been launched!
---
&gt; However, Blizzard recently stated they're getting close to their 'perfect' amount of players now. I'm just concerned that the priority of invites going out from Blizzard are to promoters. 
---
Please see OP.
---
'  However, Blizzard recently stated they're getting close to their 'perfect' amount of players now. I'm just concerned that the priority of invites going out from Blizzard are to promoters.  '
---
Good ol' times sending that buzz sound that shakes your window.
---
There are NO achievements or Transmog options at all in Classic hehe
---
No. If you're legit upset about not getting in you shouldnt be in it in the first place honestly. You probably wouldn't be actually testing anything, and you also wouldn't be giving them advertisement like streamers do.
---
Seeing a mage back in the day fire up the PoM Pyro combo was super scary!
---
It’s a daunting task. What I did (during BC) was ok it with my group/guild and bring the low peg in on dungeon runs.
---
Hey I also used to play on Argent Dawn! Sadly there is not any familiar names in the group but amazing to see that someone else from the realm is back for Classic! Keep it up!
---
Here's a real life analog from my work.
---
I have a server, I stress tested it with 100 clients bombarding it with requests for 24 hours straight. Stable as rock, no issues at all.
---
Come live, everything breaks loose at a load that is much less than my stress. The data coming from "real" people might have been fine, but there is all sorts of other requests coming in as well, like someone running a portscan in my instance that caused the server to bottleneck certain requests and cause everyone else to either connect really slowly or simply get stuck waiting for the request to resolve which it never did.
---
&gt; remind me when was the last time you played a game with 40 real people who all have to work together, keep boss mechanics and their own character in mind?
---
On the Vanilla private servers, Wildstar when it was alive, and EVE Online many times a week when forming large fleets. 
---
Oh, weren’t actually expecting an answer that destroys your entire argument were you?
---
Didn't you read? An entire day!
---
For sure, but a quick google has lead me to believe their US servers are in Chicago and Anaheim, their EU servers are in France. So my point kind of stands. I don't think Blizzard is running their servers from the countries listed. Therefore, cost is a lot higher than he is projecting.
---
EY!! Where da fuq is OZZY?
---
Wasn't Swipe the single most threat generating ability in the game?
---
When Vanilla came out, I had been playing PC games for about eight years, and the only time I used the keyboard to turn had been Doom, which I also used to learn how to aim with a mouse. My first *job* involved gaming. I was never a clicker in WoW, and even in Vanilla, I had 30+ key binds. We did theorycrafting. We were not noobs. 
---
But we also were not many. With WoW being immensely popular outside of "traditional" gaming circles, a lot of actual newbies came in. I remember trying to coach our secondary tank how to go from keyboard turning to mouse turning - something that proved difficult for her, because she was also a clicker, i.e. she needed her mouse cursor to aim for her abilities, and could not handle using the mouse to rotate the camera at the same time. When she visited, and saw how I handled my character, she was blown away by how I managed to move, turn the camera, and use abilities all at the same time (which to me and probably most of this sub just is... normal).
---
In the end, people are only as good as they need to be. If all you aimed for in Vanilla was having some epics from MC or BWL, you did not need to have any skill at all. You just needed to have access to a raid slot in a raid that had enough people to carry you. I remember running some guildies through both raids that I would not have run Scholomance with, because they would have been a liability - in that raid, they simply were told to \/follow a competent player and just twiddle their thumbs. In a 5-man, they would have had to earn their keep - 1/5 is 20% of the team effort, but 1/40 is 2.5% of the team effort. Problem with 5-mans was that owing to raiders having access to really good gear, we basically *could* compensate when one of our group was a complete whiff.
---
This all means that some players in WoW were actually pretty decent, and a lot of us were pretty bleh. Same really as today, if my short stint with BfA is any indication. I remember running a dungeon for the first time. I had read up on the bosses, and lo and behold, the entire party but me (shadow priest) and the tank croaked to some telegraphed AoE of the boss. So we two proceeded to play the encounter - him by tanking, me by splitting my time between damage and healing. We won, ran the rest of the dungeon no problem, and the only person who got their achievement for the run was me (as said, first time running). Which meant that everyone else should have had a better understanding of the boss mechanics than I did simply from reading the dungeon guide about it, but they quite evidently had no idea about, or at least no will to avoid, the mechanic that killed all three of them.
---
People now aren't better players. The game just lets them think they are.
---
Hence why the current playerbase is better at the game. Every single person has DBM installed, and gets giant flashing popups telling them to do X. Suddenly, people stop standing in fire and know what to do...
---
My husband and I were probably 30 before we figured out what to do with all of the talent points his pet had!
---
What about mounts???
---
he never listed mounts
---
Think a lot of people are missing a huge reason why people wanted Classic. No it's not that difficult, but you still had to think instead if being braindead walking through zones completing WQs. Also, people want the RPG element back, which left a long long time ago.
---
As started, Tipsout said that instead of testing, they were at the mercy of their viewers and thus, when the choice came to testing something, or doing something that viewers would like, they would do the latter.
---
Know if you are going Horde or Alliance?
---
forreal i dont know what they plan on doing about expansions but they cant keep classic wow going forever without updates and what not, people will just move on after theyve maxed gear and alts and all, and they cant risk going past wrath cause obvs thatll fuck the game
---
NO CHANGES
---
Go look the bug report thread.  Most of them are issues with the fact that Classic is essentially Legion with Vanilla pasted on top of it.
---
Any porn-spec paladins fancying a change this time around would do well to consider levelling a priest. Shield&gt;Dot&gt;Wand&gt;Porn&gt;Loot.
---
Go play a private server then lol that's not Vanilla Wow.
---
Played their parents account?? What’s the average age in here, I just assumed most people were around 30+.
---
Horde for sure
---
Well beta is way more smaller fraction so I dont know about that. Private servers serve as a more accurate audience, as many retail players definitely wont bw playing classic at all. But it remains to be seen, its all speculation
---
Too bad, I hope you get in! Your addon helps a lot!
---
Off-topic: those models look great, I sure they implement them or offer it as an option.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/earthen-ring/longarms
---
Level 120 it looks like, so apparently still plays!
---
I would go APE SHIT for an official BC server.  Classic is cool and Im glad people who want it are getting it, but BC is where its at!
---
I did this multiple times and it was great!
---
I just have to add:
---
I found talents boring when I first leveled. Therefore I often forgot to put in talent points while leveling - saving up 5-10 points for each time I put it into something. My brother would nag at me to do it, and I would just take something based on the pictures to make him shut up.
---
I always preferred Xrave:

Looks like the account was active all the way into legion. Someone is going to be suprised when they try to log back in to play classic.
---
damn straight

Hey, cool. Just found another screenshot of server first Azuregos, maybe you know some of these names :)
---
https://imgur.com/l7hehlx
---
That's the point. Most of these no changes people are wanting a blizzard private server not what Classic really is. Nook at all the things over things not being as hard as they remember or not like Nost
---
3 months time to become a full-fledged hermit. The journey has begun...
---
I kinda liked it though
---
Thanks, Cpt Obvious! (ಠ_ಠ)
---
&gt;i really don’t think many people will stay with classic. after the nostalgia is gone and people see how much more time consuming, unrewarding and at times even punishing classic is people will quit.
---
What other mmorpgs that I could play now in 2019 that will offer the same game systems and player base?
---
People still play bfa... and that is astounding, so I think classic population will be just fine.
---
I don't buy the nostalgia thing for the majority of players. I'd say the ones that do back purely based off of nostalgia are the minority. I believe most people are fully aware that you have to level weapon skills and it takes longer than 12 hours to hit max level.
---
I'm more worried about what happens when 2 or 3 months go by and servers are packed with 12k players because the server has multiple layers.
---
Been playing mostly with the switch; mk8+ and Splatoon 2...who am I kidding, I just do talent calculators all day and fret between playing a druid, priest or shaman...
---
There were lots of addons back then,any are being reworked for classic. I don't know why, but I do recall many people thinking addons were against TOS.
---
Found the fortniting twitch fan.  I was fully willing to respec from PVP weekly but they weren't willing to fund the gold.
---
&gt; first pull goes wrong and the group disbands. there is no patience and no tolerance
---
That's because people can instantly get a new group with cross-realm LFG: the worst thing Blizzard ever added.
---
I can still see my first subscription.
---
Yeah, it wasn't a good idea to pug 40 man raids, and you really just needed to be in a guild with at least 35+ committed raiders. Even though I was fortunate to be in one of those guilds that had BWL on farm, there were plenty of nights that we had to call off the raid because we were short too many key players.
---
I could fix it but I would have to take over the project, familiarize myself with their code, update it for the modern Classic API.
---
All of that vs putting in a bar that triggers off autoshot and adding some options, I would rather add the bar to this.
---
It would also pose an interesting challenge of loading different default settings based on class and some animation challenges as well.
---
All that said, I'll have to take a look at their add-on in action to see how difficult it would be to recreate the feeling of rais.
---
So any other class have a bad name like the hunter?
---
Raids were as simple as it could get. With screaming DBM, copy pasted talent, gear and rotation choices, what could go wrong in the early raids?
---
Not sure about actual list, but you can for sure browse topics here:

For most people I don't think it's a deal breaker for it to be "harder". They just want a better game. And it's a far better game than any WoW installation since WOTLK

My grandparents died before WoW was launched. :(
---
Don’t understand this concept of burning out.  I feel like when people say this, they are projecting how they feel unto others. Many people (such as myself), have leveled many characters and very much enjoy the whole leveling process.
---
My heart says Orc warrior: Played warrior since wrath, love executing people, have already leveled warrior/rogue in a vanilla atmosphere 
---
My mind says undead warlock: Looks coool, easy to level, good in pvp and pve,  can easily farm gold, I really don't have lots of time for vanilla so probably wont find a pvp and pve guild on my warrior that will have the same 4-6hr a day playstyle
---
Oh yeah but I've seen people saying blizzard is lying with their numbers and other crap.
---
Private servers are a very specific group of people. Many people who’re interested in classic wouldn’t play on a private server.  The beta was a legit random pool from actual wow players and it ended up favoring horde.
---
judging by this whole post ppl are actually believing you can storm into mc with pre bis dw tanking and unironically roflstomp everything
---
Shaman tanks, viable shaman tanks
---
This is so cool and is exactly what I loved about Classic. The insane amount of nuance and discovery of things that weren't necessarily intended by the devs, but work nonetheless. Ever since WotLK everything about how classes and spells work felt extremely locked down and standardized, leaving no more room for discovery.
---
I love weird ass specs like this and honestly now after reading, I kind of want to play a Paladin.
---
It makes sense on why you dont get to keep it but I had to ask anyways :D Appreciate the response
---
That's what I'm loving. Even when these dudes aren't streaming they are playing because they love playing classic. Not just making money off of viewers and twitch.
---
Sure but they're not thought of as a DPS class
---
I have no idea what modern hardware has to do with "player skill". You're not a better player just because your PC is faster.
---
And available information? You greatly overestimate the effort an average player is willing to put in the game. An average player wants to install the game, press "play" and then have literally every relevant piece of info spoon-fed to them IN GAME, and their goldfish-like attention requires either a marker pointing them in the right direction 24/7 or entirely linear level design.
---
"Available information"... average player considers reading wikis and crunching numbers a domain of nerds and nolifes.
---
my friends and i have a video game party tradition (stemming from us getting together for diablo 2 LAN parties and smash bros) of us getting together and ordering a bunch of chinese food to eat while we play that we still do to this day. we always order chinese food for big WoW moments (like first time we take on a new raid boss, world events etc). 
---
for normal days i'll be trying to eat healthier (cause im older now) but i'll still keep my stash of mtn dew, and ramen with me.
---
Layering for 5 months Hooray!
---
I personally hadn't logged on that account since november/december 2006, someone else has played TBC with it.
---
He was overgeared for a lvl 30 thats for sure, so was every single one in their party on top of being competent players coordinated in comms
---
Are you sure? I just double checked classidb and classic wowhead for gnomish engineering items and they clearly state that they require gnomish engineering to work. This is 1.12 data, perhaps it was possible on early patches?
---
stage 1: denial
---
Heeeeeeey!
---
You heal as well! 😉
---
They also said if you have a sufficient audience you can apply for access. Its free advertising and the executives told them to make the game as cheaply as possible, that includes advertisements. 
---
Content creators also do this for a living so they have much more time to play the game. And thats all the game needs, to be *played*
---
Then I would lean for rogue.  Horde racials are are better for rogue pvp and you get WF from shaman in PvE.  Druid is a great class but not a main if you aren't going to heal.
---
easiest way...dont say shit to him. one day when he comes over. let him make a character and run around. Dude will call you the next at 7am asking to come over and play.
---
Claymore of Unholy Might and the rank 14 swords are extremely close to those axes. Sword spec for the PvP burst is far superior than the 5% crit. 2h PvE past MC is a waste, even at that point DW is better with optimal gear.
---
So then you send him some coin and fly him to org.
---
Ah ya, I tried Knight Online! I kind of liked the idea of people setting up a physical booth for selling their goods, but it got kinda messy after a while lol
---
Got into stresstest last week. Played till lv2. I just wanna play for real on launch. Dont care for the beta and stresstests. Ill just suck it up till launch and play something else till then.
---
 Pala or Priest?   
---
I will duo level with a Warrior and endgame with an additional Hunter.   
---
Whats better for healing options the Pala or Priest?  
---
We will mostly do dungeons and from time to time pvp   
---
MAYBE we will even raid casually  
---
I played a pala in legion, enjoyed it a lot  
---
I played spriest in wotlk also fun playstyle   
---
I know that both of these examples have nothing to do with classic, i just wanted to mention it.
---
The fact that this post is still referenced 15 years later is living proof of the concept "it's funny because it's true." This is a rare example of a forum post truly striking a chord within the Paladin community. The irony is that Avenging Wrath, which was originally Blizzard's way of saying "we have no idea how to make your spec interesting and competitive, so here's 30% more damage every 2 minutes," eventually became the centerpiece of Ret pve in modern WoW. Good times.
---
Well ya listed no cons for shammy so that’s an easy pick.
---
Here ya go mate.

great stuff, thanks!
---
Classic releases just as I finish grad school. ; )
---
I think you may be playing too many private servers.
---
I got hypers
---
In PVP, faces will be melted by shadow priests.
---
How many moms do you need?
---
That's not an issue though.
---
You have it the wrong way around, the burden of proof doesn't simply disappear because of some upvotes in a reddit thread.
---
I’m so rolling a Night Elf Mohawk!
---
You get it bro! These battles had real feeling to them. You knew those names and you knew that damn rogue XX and wanted to kill his ass so bad!
---
beg love love beg dead
---
Oh no... you posted in the wrong sub.
---
I have no input on skill on the average gamer, but I gotta say, just because people have a wealth of information available to them doesn't mean they will automatically take the time to learn it.
---
Try charging all mob only to have it tagged by a hunter!
---
I doubt it would happen, but the possibility has been discussed since Classic was officially announced. It’d be hilarious, imo. I’d have a good laugh about it.
---
Is this some kind of joke lmao? Getting hyped for TBC when vanilla isn't even released? Has blizzard even said anything about TBC server?
---
No key bindings :D Good ol’ vanilla!
---
Show us inventory ! I love checking out other peoples inventories, especially from old characters.   
---
Does this make me a freak? :(
---
Classic is getting the streamlined AV that has far less NPCs than it originally had, so there won't be those day long AVs in Classic.
---
I guess I don't understand why people care about this.  My husband started playing before me, I started about a month or so before BC came out.  We came from Everquest so we knew from mmo's but WoW was completely different.  Never raided, didn't even get to 60 before BC, but who cares?  We mostly liked leveling and that's what we'll be doing again.  We are probably going to go with our original pairing, him hunter me druid.  Man the crap we used to get up to, we were so clueless. My husband still rags me about me saying "I wonder what's over there?" or "what's the worst that can happen?"  Dying in WoW even then was so much less stressful than EQ!
---
Queues and no layering
---
A small player base and lots of quits?
---
Im gonna play but i agree with this guy. Lota of ppl will come back for a bit and realize why they moved on. I know its hard to read but you arent comparing wow to 2006 media but 2019
---
Correct, You Absolute Legend! 
---
This was one of my first aswell, loved it to bits. 
---
1 down 2 to go!
---
Can't complete LBRS quests while &gt;5 people though.
---
I .. Err... Had really long fingers :p  I didn't really utilize keybindings until I started raiding/PVPing :)
---
&gt; it seems you're just looking for an argument
---
Seems like youre jelous, you wrote a wall of text with zero arguments. bye.
---
im nearly 40, was an adult when it launched and it wasnt my first mmo. but you are right, a lot of people do talk a load of shit around here.
---
I was still bad and keyboard turned until mid tbc, even if I was in a decent guild and dripping in epics.
---
tbh i kinda like the random demon names and don't really want to have the same ones i had in vanilla. i enjoy summoning a new demon only to find they have some totally weird name that i inevitably shorten into something cute and odd.
---
Just because there will be a cooldown on dragonslayer does not mean people won't use worldbuffs.
---
I think I'm not alone in saying the bar is really nice for Hunters, it looks good and is really functional and simple. I messaged the original creator and he said this about the upgrade:
---
"Sorry but i'm not playing anymore. (university)  
---
You/anyone can upgrade and share 'there isn't any copyright'. "
---
This is a version of it that was updated for private servers which fixed a couple of bugs and added a lag compensation meter to it: https://github.com/Zarant/rais_AutoShot
---
Thousands? Thats it? Thats 1 server. If it fails that hard blizz may just can the project
---
I always had the opinion that Blizzard would always be the one to kill WOW in one of two ways:
---
1. WOW sucks and dies.
---
2. Blizzard creates a new MMO to overtake WOW. I just did not know it would be WOW (classic) itself.
---
What happens when you give a useful tool like DamageMeters to braindead teenagers and angsty college kids?
---
Comments like these and toxic behavior that killed guilds.
---
I'm just about done replaying all of warcraft 3. Actually took longer than I thought.
---
I think this is the best answer.
---
That's crazy man. I got standing 16, but I forgot to turn in all my marks. I had like 4 pages of them in my mailbox, so I feel like I could have been top 10.
---
it takes a long time. You're better to level you pets as you level. Its a pain to level a low level pet to 60. As someone said below, as good way to do it is to take it on an instance run or raid and just have it passive. 
---
Seriously, to save you a tonne of pain.....just bring out  a new pet every 4-6 levels and let it catch up as you level. You wouldnt even notice much of a difference while leveling.
---
Sadly not, I wasn't aware that it was accessible at the time, only seeing it flying in and out of IF.
---
There used to be huge stalemates where the horde/alliance front is moving only inches. Melee sitting back while the range go at each other. Then there would be coordinated pushes to break their lines. All the while other people are trying to get resources and take objectives. They were epic battles!
---
I think people are more knowledge about the game.
---
Then again I did RFC on a pserver and the hunter ran out of ammo and decided to just stand there rather than go in with his axe...
---
Reincarnations CD is the same as the one on soulstone
---
Probably different from private servers, like many things seem to be. I'm just gonna get to 37 and then level up via grinding Badlands until I catch him!
---
I'd argue best to put it on the shaman. SS is your first line of wipe prevention, Reinc is your second, and if it's on the shaman you reduce the risk of them reincarnating while forgetting that the priest could SS thus blowing both your wipe prevention at the same time.
---
Nope, we're getting the streamlined version that had far less NPCs than the original AV, which means you can zerg the opponent.
---
Mongoose wasnt possible to get in the 19 twink bracket. Lvl 29 twink bracket however had some 1h weapon quest reward (at least on horde) that had the itemlevel of a 30+ weapon, which allowed for applying mongoose on it.
---
Why so mad?he brings up lots of good and VALID points
---
Practice what? Lucifron pulls?
---
Lots of retail wrath babies that don't understand how much 50G was throughout the entire expansion or the fact that the majority of guilds formed without raid content progression goals
---
Oh, I see some familiar ones indeed! If I recall correctly I've (asaki) been a member of TFR at the end of WotLK, not sure if you were playing back then though.
---
Thanks brainlet.
---
I mean obviously classic is not for everyone, I dont know why you feel the need to point that out lol
---
But a lot of us want the RPG back in our MMO
---
Female, dance naked. Profit.
---
Funny enough, beta for Korea (for original wow) let them keep their characters when the game went live.  (Source: Wow Diary, Staats)
---
Like I said I remember vanilla I played it. You didn’t even know what ccs classes had early and you think rogues in the mid 20s are one shotting people lol. But cool deflection to private servers. I’ve stated multiple abilities the class has and why it made it very strong at the level you insist they aren’t good. You’ve done nothing but say that they aren’t and Cite that I’m wrong with zero reasoning behind your statement
---
I would be ok with classic expansions, but edit them to keep Vanilla design. For example (not all encompassing):
---
\- Longer leveling
---
\- Keep professions relevant
---
\- reduce item/power level bloat between expansions and raid tiers
---
How many private players? 50k? What about the other 500k to 1m that might play and quit after a few months
---
To be fair you still get to know the premades on your battlegroup, and I think I would rather cross-realm BGs rather than hour long queues for BGs - which is why it was brought in to begin with.
---
..both?
---
Both are great healers in their own right. Paladin's are (from what I remember) the better PvP healers but Spriest would be better at damage in pvp. 
---
For PvE they are 1a and 1b for healers. Both fantastic and everyone wants them. 
---
Leveling with a warrior, it MIGHT be a little better for priest so you guys are not competing for gear at all but it shouldn't be too much of a hassle. 
---
I realize this doesn't help by saying "this is absolutely better" but hopefully it helps a bit.
---
Did you really have to capitalise every other word?
---
I actually agree. 
---
Its not even about being salty, its about giving back to the fans that followed this game for many many years. 
---
The best thing imho opinion is if they could expand the Beta and invite more,  but i really doubt they are going to do that at this point
---
I don't think I would though, I tend to play the same 3-4 games a lot, I've played pretty much mostly Overwatch since it came out. If I love the game, I don't really burn out. I wanna get into beta so I can figure out which class I wanna roll :(
---
How the hell youve managed to find any time to meet your wife tho? 500 days played looks like tight schedule for me
---
Take skinning and another gathering prof. Once 60, take enchanting as you can do DM tribute runs and DE the blues that drop.
---
Any idea how many servers there are ?
---
Yeah that group was minmaxed to the teeth.
---
I thought my lifetime of over 10k hours was excessive.
---
Jeez, that's...That's a lotta hours in a pretty short time
---
Man you have mastered lying to yourself
---
Is that a gs? Don’t leave me hanging man.
---
"tHeN dOnT pLaY cLaSsIc!!!11" 90% of this sub xd
---
Long, too loong.
---
Abusing elite mob methods and such, I would say about 14-20 hours.
---
Money. If they do anything its rerelease BC for no cost to them.
---
Why pay millions to develop a xpac for under 1mill players
---
Yeah i’m using it currently just to figure out what the heck I want to play lol.
---
It's hard but you have to accept the truth that money drives our world and find you way to happyness in it.
---
Kinda sucks but overall its a level 30 meta that no one will give a shit about a week after launch, sure it sucks to miss a little piece but its not exactly a massive stamp on wow history.   
---
Only thing that really sucks is the fact streamers have had alot of favouritism butttt Blizz are a business end of the day and thats free advertisement for them which they'd be stupid not to take also the more people that join Classic the better it is for everyone.   
---
That and just reading a post of someone whos a complete noob (posts words not my mine) got into the beta is painful as someone who played Vanilla.
---
as a lady, i usually make a lady character but honestly it comes down to how the character looks and their animations.  its nice to have a little variety sometimes so i switch it up depending on race and class.
---
Was windfury really nerfed in 1.12? That's the patch we're getting with classic right? I'm not hearing much talk about this during beta
---
Is enhancement going to be terrible?
---
4-6 hours a day is more than enough for most guilds, I wouldn't worry about that at all.
---
The best part?  The armor isn't class restricted.  You can mog it on any plate wearer once you have the appearance.
---
The thing that sets apart this blizzard Venture from the private server Community is that there will not be separate classic and burning Crusade servers. It's Progressive. Unlike the private server Community where classic servers open and draw tens of thousands of players for a couple months, and after that several burning Crusade servers open and draw tens of thousands of players for a couple months, either with no actual guarantees of progressing further, here we know blizzard classic will progressed burning Crusade. Not going to disappear. Not going to freeze at the end of content for all time. This is the guarantee that private server players never had, and one of the reasons why they grew to be so flighty jumping from server to server looking for stability.
---
You needed some Fire Res on your gear past Geddon, back in vanilla. Tanks, doubly so. Never played Private Servers but I have no idea how things went there.
---
holy shit you are delusional OP.
---
The difference between getting 5fps in raids back then and 100+ today will certainly increase your APM, right?
---
Some of us are eager to help make the game the best it can be.
---
I cant speak for everyone but if i were to get beta i would level up a class im not going to play at launch and i would report every bug i notice.
---
I got into stress test and didnt do any leveling but i did report bugs just the same.
---
Now ofcourse we all think we know best what is a bug and what is not... im sure im no different, i played in real vanilla and i havent spent  too much time playing on inaccurate pservers so i claim i am able to notice a real bug and not a not-bug. :P
---
Watched a few steamers and they have not known a few things being opposite of what they claim.
---
So it was funny seeing Sodapoppin think deviate fish works on druid forms in vanilla... it obviously worked on pservers because they are borked but once he tried in beta the expression was priceless.  
---
Thats just one example.
---
Im sure most people think Shadowmeld is useless for rogues and druids since you  cant use it in combat (in classic), but shadowmeld also has passive effect for regular stealth to make it more effective... welcome to vanilla, devs did think up these things and many people have forgotten. :P
---
Upvoted: that's awesome man. Are you looking for participants for future podcasts? I'd love to contribute.
---
5:00 est which kinda sucks cause I'm stuck at work till 5:30. 
---
Hopefully I can log on tonight and get some playtime in.
---
Anything that was not in Vanilla is an issue.
---
Not sure what you're expecting, there was variations of DBM in vanilla, there was questhelper, think there was atlas-loot (but probably had atlas), castbar's I'm not 100% sure about but I wouldn't be surprised.
---
Troll blood potions for any melee is extremely beneficial, buy them, use them.
---
Proof?
---
That last section seems pretty important. So many people talking about making super dramatic shifts in their lives for a game that's not going anywhere for a long time.
---
I think I NEED TO, yes.
---
Someday I want to be an NPC.  Cows would probably be my prefered choice.
---
Always stats but I appreciate the rare occasions when I look like a baller.
---
Hacker? He either sold it or gave it to a guildie...or both.
---
What an absurd statement. It's like saying people are better at chess today than 100 years ago because some people 100 years ago were blind.
---
Woooow 13 spells ohh mahh gawwhd!!!!111
---
Spamms FB 24/7
---
LoL
---
We also only brought 1 spriest in our raids. Can't comment on shammy because I was alliance though.
---
Every time I've tuned in he's bitching about something being "turbo AIDS." I think the other guy is watching a whole different steam.
---
Oh yeah. That too. I had completely forgotten about the runes. Which means that those going for a 2nd ID kill will need to farm MC trash for hours. Yikes.
---
Ive been doing it wrong all along lol
---
I've been practicing this on beta and I can time it like 95 percent of the time. DPS is stupidly insane
---
Dude ud love it. The ppl who say its super good have played it on pservers recently, I swear it has nothing to do with nostalgia.
---
&gt; I have no idea what modern hardware has to do with "player skill". You're not a better player just because your PC is faster.
---
Did you ever play online games in the early 2000s? Plenty of raiders would spend entire fights staring at the floor so they could maintain a playable framerate. It was not uncommon for a significant portion of your raid to lag out or completely DC mid-fight. Both of these situations apply to PvP as well.
---
Now, in 2019, very, *very*, few players are going to have trouble running a game from 2004. Most players have access to internet speeds and reliable ten times what was the norm back then. No, that doesn't automatically make players more skilled, but your average bozo player will still do better at 60 fps than 5.
---
&gt;You greatly overestimate the effort an average player is willing to put in the game
---
You underestimate them. If someone is having trouble on a game, they would have to be one of the laziest motherfuckers on the world not to just pop their problem into Google on their phone, a process that takes about ten seconds. In 2004, you would be lucky to find anything of value, but now you'd be hard pressed to NOT find a solution to even the most obscure issue.
---
Also, chances are, if these players are as completely hopeless as you paint them to be, they'll just go back to BFA or something.
---
Finally going to jump on this. Played a lot in vanilla, bc, wotlk and sort of fell off after that (although I’ve dipped in and out the last couple of years). Mained Rogue and Shaman (resto) back in the day, had a blast on both. Needless to say I’m mega pumped for classic but can’t quite decide yet as to what I want to play. I’m levelling with two friends - a priest and a warrior, both been active since the early days. 
---
At the moment I’m super torn between Warlock and another Shaman (potentially resto/ele if my friend wouldn’t mind going shadow) - my list of in game priorities are fun, utility/usefulness, versatility and longevity as I want to be able to progress raid wise, solo stuff and do fun quests. Mages will be aplenty, Hunter seems ok but quite boring (no offence), Rogue I’ve tried (also technically still on the table but I feel they bring very little to groups), Shaman dps is not really a thing, Druid doesn’t really appeal to me in terms of class fantasy, and Warrior dps will be a tough competition from the get go. I guess that leaves Priest but considering the circumstances - maybe not so much. Unless there is some crazy synergy between two priests levelling together?
---
Thoughts?
---
Well Venruki is a profesionnal mage pvper. So either lvl 30 meta doesnt mean much, or perhaps you should look into a wow career!
---
My biggest share of /played is from Vanilla, TBC and start of WotLK. I took a break just before the end of WotLK and then periodically came back to try new expansions, but never the hardcore way I did with the first 3 expansions :)
---
Warrior is trash at that level, rogues don’t one shot and once they are out of stealth they are in trouble, mages lose to lock, shaman might be tough but I’m always horde. Druid doesn’t do enough damage to be a huge threat although a good one can give ya an issue if they time the bash into a heal perfectly but not having to worry about warstomp since I’m horde helps. Hunters are super strong pvp especially world pvp the whole game. Locks don’t do great against 1v1 until SL and gear against them. I don’t know what class you played (if you even did play a lock) but the level you are discussing locks are anything but a free kill.
---
It doesn't even matter though, you get nothing from going goblin it's a waste of time.
---
Shhh. Don't spoil our secret leveling rotation. The primary reason why I'm leveling a priest 4th time in 'vanilla' again.
---
Yep, lost mine in hard drive crash. :(
---
I'm thinking Skin/Mine whilst levelling, then drop Skinning for Engineering, and once max Engi, drop Mining for Enchanting so I can disenchant BoPs. So Skin/Mine to begin and end up with Engi/Ench - plan? 😃
---
No it won't, been playing pserver since feb and playing beta now and I'm getting more hyped and happy as I play.
---
You missed a great mage resource from leveling to gearing. Infra's mage guide: goo.gl/24k5Zs
---
No summoning stones exist in vanilla?so just warlocks can summon to raids or was that after?
---
Nobody moved on. The game had an expansion. Nobody got a choice
---
Fuck off
---
And thank god for that, I hated when they made that change where I couldn't hide my helmet/cloak without visiting transmog. That alone made me go and get the transmog mount.
---
There was a link floating around that will take you to your old billing info. I was able to verify that I remembered correctly that I have a day 1 account. No beta access though...
---
yeah the fact that im not on dial up is going to help a lot lol
---
The ultimate choice.
---
* Arena.
---
* Spec switching.
---
* Instant mail to your alts. 
---
* Various Engineering stuff added throughout the game
---
* Gold tokens
---
Well also at the time, there were less Diminishing returns he was able to chain together CC.
---
whoever skins the leather wins the leather. however if there are more than one skinners in a group i usually work it out with them like who can skin what (like if theres 2 of us we skin every other mob so its split fair down the middle etc).
---
The comments which triggered you were not talking about the same people you are talking about.
---
Less pvp warlocks on alliance side naturally due to WotF, so it's better to go for the stun resist as it helps massively vs. a lot of match ups. Resist one stun and you have a much easier time beating paladins, rogues, warriors, hunters with concussive stun, etc.
---
Agreed. I dont understand why ppl wants to be in the beta.
---
Blizzard rebuilt the game in their modern client. They should be compensated for their work, including upkeep and continued support.
---
Being able to switch specs whenever/wherever. And having gear stats change accordingly.
---
Yeah, holy shit.
---
I played this game almost every day from release until mid WoD, when I quit (Excluding BC, which I skipped). but even I could take a week or two off when I went to visit relatives.
---
I'm 49 now ... 2003 was a long time ago :D
---
Your toon looks like Van Cleeff ;)!
---
Same, though I spend most of TBC levelling as I was a nooby kid, so I'm mostly just looking forward to the return of harder levelling.
---
Correct, thanks to RFA and char transfer between account I'm now the proud owner of 4 WoW accounts ... with characters spread across them and having to decided which account I'll pay gametime for. (And Expansions are expensive to get since I'll need em for all 4)
---
But major patches always release content. That's kinda the whole stick behind them. The only thing you are saying can be considered part of a patch is class balancing or changes to items? Just pretend adding an item changes the mobs loot table. That's a change! 
---
I'm not 100% anti change. I actually like the phases they have decided on (minus the absolute slaughterfest of phase 2). I just don't like the term #nochanges being thrown around like we're getting a perfect recreation or something.
---
You do know there are successful vanilla servers since 2004 and even right now with people who clear BWL, and Naxx in one go right? with 40 people, even from different countries, and languages right? With classic you'll have dedicated servers and people relating to your time zones and laungage, plus better support and less bugs.   
---
Classic unrewarding? What do you call retail, definitely not rewarding in anyway.   
---
What you think, its totally wrong. But you can keep your opinion, and be proven wrong.
---
This is accurate.
---
My pvp server had a 'truce' for the green dragons when they first came out. Whichever side got their raid together and pulled first would get a chance to kill it, and then each raid would take turns after each wipe. One day we decided to not only wipe the alliance raid on one of the dragons. But follow them to each other dragon - wipe them - and then kill the dragon ourselves. Juicy forum drama ensued afterwards.
---
I quit all pservers business the day Classic was announced. I want to have proper wow withdrawal again (like I had when i was a kid and my mom banned me from the computer), then play like hell when it comes out!
---
The problem is that the clickbaity titles work. I fucking hate them as well,  it as long as they work people are going to use them.
---
I began in july 2005. My birthday month so figures...
---
Only 6 months or so after EU launch! \\ (•◡•) /
---
Beats not being able to play at all imo :)
---
They may do so, as they've still got the 31-60 content to test, as well as likely needing to test how the servers handle a large volume of players over a more significant length of time.
---
Stress testing is good, but that's a huge number trying to log in over the course of a few hours, might be good to test something similar over the course of days/weeks leading up to release.
---
I would fully support a petition against cross realm BGs!
---
It's great, Blizzard literally gives us xp to look at naughty websites. I'm surprised there hasn't been a media backlash about it.
---
If you are doing the calculations based on private server data, take that with a grain of salt. Even Joanna came out and said that levelling in Classic is significantly slower, due to reduced quest drops and mana regen being lower.
---
Nice. I played a Rogue as well (same username as here) and a Mage named Perky that I did more raiding with and a splash of PvP. Good times. I played Undead Horde side.
---
&gt; It's like saying people are better at chess today than 100 years ago because some people 100 years ago were blind.
---
Excuse me? It's not like that at all. Significantly more people have access to hardware and internet meeting if not far exceeding the requirements of Vanilla today than when it released.
---
Meanwhile, as far as I know, the number of eyes in people's heads since the 1920s have been comparatively stagnant.
---
In what game has beta stuff progressed to the live game?...
---
How is it not a gameplay change?
---
Pretty similar, my 1st dungeon was BFD and i DID have a sword and shield, and even used defensive stance... 
---
People asked me to taunt more, so i did.... 
---
I was using Emotes like /laugh :P Didn't even know it was a skill.
---
So they explained it to me, explained my roll in a dungeon, it all went pretty good... I then proceded to respec... and LEVEL AS A PROT WARRIOR untill like lvl 50.... GOD THAT SUCKED.
---
Female or male tauren shaman? A simple choice that couldnt be any more difficult
---
Tell me what “mitigation stats” they have which puts them at level 37
---
Is no one going to mentiom +3 weapom damage enchant. That blue glow was life.
---
So if you're just debating between Warlock and Shaman, both bring great things to the table for raids but I would say warlocks are better at soloing (someone correct me if I'm wrong). 
---
You said rogue and priest are possibly on the table? If so, rogues do not bring much of anything past great dps to raids and priests are great if you're holy in raids not so much spriest (usually only one slot per raid for them) but spriests are good solo/pvp from what I remember.
---
The female dwarfs look awesome in T2 armour if that helps.
---
You can send a couple of copper to that character and he can fly to orgrimmar. Remember that you start with your own races capital city flightpath.
---
But they were for wrath.
---
Sounds like that's the case for you.
---
Layering is a necessary evil that is going to destroy classics first 6 months if they don't get ahead of it now.
---
We know armour and resistances for raid bosses are off (if not everything in the world), but that won't really do too much considering the knowledge level of current players, stuff might (or might not) die slower, but it'll still die far faster than it did originally.
---
No, I’m not entitled to a beta invite. Would I like to have one? Yes. But I’m not upset I didn’t get one bc I never assumed I would.
---
You're right, the EU server is in France, always has been. There isn't another EU server to my knowledge, it's just in their headquarters in Paris I think.
---
I've always been more partial to the aesthetics of the male tauren but das just me.
---
When was your first sub?  Mine was in Sept 2005, but only shows as far back as Sept 2012.
---
Every single video I have seen of someone in vanilla regardless if they were lvl 55, or raiding naxx has been some backpedalling clicking completley trash UI wearing random gear for looks. All of them. Vurtne is the only player I've seen footage of, where I can't immediately tell that he's from vanilla because of how good he is.
---
Doesn't beat having queues though.
---
It's not an expansion, not everyone needs to be able to play at the exact moment they get on.
---
IF they do, add queues and make layers selectable.
---
Because addons gives massive advantages?
---
And if people are allowed to modify their client to gain those advantages, and 80% of theplayers are they might as well make it baseline.
---
Addons have already done an insane amount of harm to retail WoW, and it will fuck up vanilla as well.
---
Yeah it'd have to be higher resolution/more skill buttons used in order to type in "of" in there.
---
I think he meant tens of thousands, but missed the "tens of" part.
---
Too far away. I need to get closer.
---
Yeah I’m happy I still get one of my favorite games in pristine condition with minimal changes. But when you’re passionate about something and get turned down - it just kind of feels like a sucker punch lol.
---
Where’s the bucket?
---
&gt;and I have heard some comments about how "wrong" it feels to pay a monthly fee for such an old game.
---
Main reason I'll be leaving my small group of friends - some are so adamant about "I've already played the content I'm not going to pay again"
---
Morons...
---
I agree, but I like seeing a real rating system and ranking system.
---
Private server raid difficulty is increased. Classic wow raids are probably on par with normal mode retail raids as per difficulty related to the dps/healing requirements, with the exception that classic raids have barely any mechanics. AQ40 and Naxx may approach the difficulty of beginner heroic raid bosses. I would be very confident that if you are able to kill Jaina or Uunat in normal mode you would breeze through classic raiding content.
---
Many moms! ~~Handle it~~
---
all you need is to be subscribed to wow, no ordering/paying extra
---
Don't click
---
I think you underestimate the power a 50k viewership has. When classic launches, every single pleb in his stream is going to want to be around him (not soda specifically, other streamer, same issue) and killing mobs or corpsecamping him. I'd hardly call him entitled for what happened in the arena.
---
de-compress?
---
IIRC mongoose was allowed at release of TBC and the level requirements was implemented later. I may be wrong though, its been a while.
---
Well kinda messed up my comment, i just think it won't have a real impact on how it feels nor how you play. You just have to click once in a pile of mobs and you're done, rather than once per mob.
---
Dont hate him, hell I've watched a bunch of his beta streams. I just find the guy annoying. The persona that he plays is just super annoying to me. I much prefer streamers that just act normal and dont put on some big act.
---
Except it's not a discussion, he's not asking "will this be a thing? here are my thoughts." He's saying "this will not be a thing, period. fuck off if you think otherwise."
---
It’s included in the normal subscription. I haven’t heard about any downloading, but I imagine if we do have to download classic it won’t take very long
---
Nah, this is a Kawasaki Zephyr. Customized quite a bit though.
---
Ive actually never leveled one.
---
Might be time to try.
---
There will still be queues no doubt, plus you say not everyone needs to play the exact moment, but if it launches and you can't get on, that's a bit shit, no? Even more so if its because someone who's going to be on for 10m just to try it is on and you're now 10m(+) behind the group or even your own friends who are planning to power level.
---

---
&gt;I think the Consensus is that druid tanking is viable but only quite late game and warrior is usually superior
---
Not really the case. Druids struggle the most during BWL, but its perfectly doable. Early MC they are better than Warriors as their preraid gear is just damn good. Warriors have to either sacrifice threat or mitigation while Druids can get both.
---
&gt;Shut up lmao
---
What a rebuttal
---
We got emp runs down to around 15-18 mins on pservers. It’s not going to be hard.
---
Looking for Guild - 
---
NA / PVP / Horde
---
Week Night raiding starting after 830 pm EST 2-4 times a week is fine
---
Planning on playing Shaman - Resto for raiding pvp.. enhancement for memes. Have played WoW on/off since 2005, heavily raided in BC clearing all content, WoTLK up to ICC where school got in the way.. Came back in Cata for a few months, Raided solid in Legion clearing all content with some old friends.. Completely lost interest with BFA after 2 months. Looking to get back into Classic, but expect time to be limited as I am 36 , married, 1 kid 1 on the way... Realistic expectations are 1-60 will take me 4 weeks or so depending on other commitments. Want a fun group of similar people to me to get lost in Classic WoW with.. DM on reddit and am happy to join a discord to meet/greet to find if i'm a fit for your guild :)
---
classic wasn't hard, it was time consuming and the stuff you got was off of a lot of effort
---
retail is far more challenging when it comes to mechanics, the only thing that keeps up is pvp
---
lol? you're stating information you got from playing all those "classic accurate" private servers. I didn't say anything about the mid 20's I mentioned the 40s. Your warlock experience comes private servers running 1.12 from the last 3 or 4 years or longer...and thats okay because you wont beable to actually play a real classic server until blizzard releases theirs in August..It is fine no need to get upset over false information you experienced on several private servers.
---
I don’t find this to be a problem for me personally I’m going to play classic because I want to build an awesome character.
---
Eve online subscription is the same price as WoW.
---
The difference for years was the  fact that in EvE you could play the game and buy gametime with ingame currency, in WoW we got tokens only a few years ago.
---
In classic this wont be the case... we will never get tokens. But on the other hand since you pay the same sub for retail and classic, you could just play  retail and earn your sub in there.
---
Play retail to play classic for free = you wont have to pay a penny.
---
you should see diablo 3 subreddit. the amount of butthurtness when i bash on diablo 3 is outstanding.
---
Some of the fun, immersive stuff they added later. Archeology, holiday events, the fishing raft and picnic basket, etc.
---
Imagine getting triggered in this way.
---
Money grab? Blizzard? No! Say it aint so!
---
&gt; very easily verifiable by the patch notes.
---
Small example as to why that saying is relevant is the fact that we have gone though plenty of expansions and other games as a whole community. I'm not expecting everyone to be Johnny on the spot with every dungeon / raid pull... but there should be way fewer people that have zero clue how to do a dungeon.
---
As someone who was in high school and uni for most of my WoW career, I'm glad Classic is releasing now that I'm working.
---
I have almost an entire month of leave booked.
---
Point still stands.. vs retail itll be a small number and outside china subs are already really low. So low they wont talk about it.
---
Some new ppl will return but i worry they wont stay long when they get bored
---
Maul is. It has a threat multiplier on damage done, which again gets boosted by the threat multiplier from being in Bear Form.
---
Unlike Warrior. Druid threat is based on raw damage, meaning they will scale better with buffs and gear than a Warrior.
---
I'm just going to use [my old gaming laptop](https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16834313684) for the first 40-50 levels with my external monitor and a Razr mouse.
---
This is a different take on what should I play...
---
Tonight is the stress test part two! Should I stress test? Or should I work on Heroic Jaina AOTC Jill with my guild?
---
Sounds like someone never actually raided in vanilla..
---
You are wasting your time. They are hard blocked on classic staying classic. Whatever you'll say is wrong because it's not classic and classic is their religion. 
---
Blizz went as far as reproducing pointless bug just for the sake of authenticity. So forget about a reduced cost for respec.
---
What you want is WoW 2.0 with the classic philosophy. You'll have to wait.
---
I raided in Vanilla up to and including a couple hours in Naxx.  Did a lot of AQ and lower however, idk how I got into them.  From what I remember my shaman had the tank shield from Gen Drak and a mixture of hunter and shaman gear.  I just was clueless about itemization and thought whatever looked like an upgrade was good.  Such a noob... it wasn’t until I got my lock to max level in BC where I was like “wow... I was probably embarrassing to have healing a group yet people still wanted me to...”
---
So when it come out, I’ll already basically have it then?
---
Means very little to me. Just means that anyone who got *really* unlucky in dungeons would have to re-roll their twink and try again for the bop gear.
---
I just started stardew valley I think I’ll just slowly build a farm while I wait.
---
I think the thing that sucks to me is that the beta is currently an experience you cannot recreate on private servers, retail or anything. Level capped at 30 full of PvP and pve trials.
---
It's really cutting that entire guilds Worth of people get to experience this unique experience which includes several detractors to our efforts of getting classic servers and even people who have never played WoW at all.
---
It's not that I don't think they should be in, it just feels really unfair that there are so many people from the same group of friends in and having this experience while the rest of us wait.
---
Did a quick search on Google and was able to find the link to the full history: 
---
https://us.battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html
---
Triggered is a wrong word. I just don't support immature people who use that word in an offensive way about anyone, especially when trying to desperately make a point.
---
The information is definitely more accessible now, but I still laugh at the people who think that all we did was button click and spin in circles to beat content which had never been. Skill and knowledge are mutually exclusive, and while I had keybinds/macros/addons in vanilla, mouse clicking in PVE is not as dramatic as people make it out to be. 
---
For the PVPers who were mouse clicking in actual vanilla, god rest their souls.  Those were probably the new MMO players, and/or the 10 year olds playing on their dad’s computer. 
---
The players who knew what was going on were only limited by the testing and simulation iterations that are available, not by mechanics that suddenly came out of nowhere. It wasn’t the first MMO to have keybinds and shit.
---
That's a very skewed and narrow way of looking at it. That person still achieved those things, they just didnt achieve it every time they rolled a new toon - THEY still got those rare items or titles though.
---
This also doesn't make classic alt-unfriendly, if having an alt means you have to have all the rare items and mounts across every single character - you're in for a lot of work and that's kinda unfriendly I guess - but that's not the case for the vast majority of people.
---
Some like myself in vanilla had a 60 shaman for raiding, 60 rogue for pvp and 60 mage for farming and extra profession slots. Though i'm the kind of person who likes to have every class at max level, have been that way since vanilla, even if I don't play an xpac all the way through I will at least come back and raise them all to new level cap. Doesn't mean most of them have good gear or are "useful".
---
In vanilla I expect to continue the tradition of having multiple alts, ones that aren't being used will just serve as bank alts and almost all will serve as extra toons for professions. Though I am the kind of player who enjoys farming for gold, especially now that I do shift work and can't commit to a regular raid schedule.
---
Yeah that‘s a huge point of classic, content is in a way „undertuned“ you don‘t have to play meta classes and can have tons of fun with niche stuff
---
It looks rad man, did you build it yourself? I’d love to make a cafe racer from an old UJM but it’s hard to find a donor here in Aus cheap enough to warrant doing it.
---
27" 1440p 144hz 1ms are cheap now, like $300
---
If you work on Heroic Jaina - by the potential time you are done the stress test might be playable!
---
Yeah I could see that. I haven’t really given up hope. I just felt a slap in the face when I realized certain streamers thought they had to save their character progression in... wow... what? I guess it’s good to understand what I noob would think playing the game I guess.
---
And as a second point, there are actually "mechanic testing fights" even in the lower easier dungeons.  The thing is, they are rarely run at the intended level. Most of the time groups are several levels higher, on average, which at lower levels makes a massive difference in difficulty.
---
As a baseline, a group should be 2 levels LOWER than the level of the final boss for intended challenge, this is based on endgame 60 instances having level 62 bosses. So if you are running deadmines with a level 20 tank, you are doing it on easymode. If you are running maraudon princess with characters of level 50 or higher, you are trivializing some aspects of the instance.
---
There are people who will flat out refuse to run an instance unless the entire party is over the intended level. Of course this can trivialize things. It's just a necessary evil when you have a game without fake mob scaling, players will be able to run leveling dungeons above the intended level to make things easier. There is no way to fix this, but it does mean those players get rewards that are less valuable, since the item drops are strongest when used at lower levels.
---
I had multiple Twinks in vanilla. You just had to be extremely vigilant in making sure you didn't level. You have to have a plan as to how you're going to get your BiS's and at what level. Once you've got everything you stop doing anything that gives XP.
---
I only had one character I accidentally dinged. I don't remember how, but it just became a twink for the next BG lv group.
---
I'd say don't add it, it will ruin my immersion.
---
Druid you definitely don't need a leveling partner. They're one of the most solid levelers you can choose from.
---
&gt;Karazhan was still run towards the end of TBC
---
Only by alts or mains farming badges for gear.
---
However, that's still a huge improvement on the current game where each new patch instantly renders all previous content redundant.
---
While its very cool that the beta has its own meta, kind of based around arathi and the whirlwind weapons, i feel it would alter the game too much if people could just pause wherever they want.
---
I also dont think at the same time that wed be able to recreate any meaningful events out of it, as they would all be very unnatural.
---
HoTS was one though the game has changed so far that most people who played beta probably dont remember anymore. World of warships was another game where beta progression came to live servers.
---
Not me, but I didn't want both of your posts to have zero comments.
---
What in that comment makes you feel the OP is bragging?
---
Personally I just read it as a neutral anecdote which was only meant as yet another "no, I'll be fine OP, I don't think I'll burn out".
---
Yeah, not sure what game all these people were playing. The first dungeon I ever did in an MMO was wailing caverns. I tanked it on my shaman. My friend insisted it would work because I had a shield, he 'saw a shaman killing like 3 pig guys at once so they are op' and he had just trained flash heal (I think he was level 21). It didn't go 100% smoothly iirc but we cleared it just fine.
---
I honestly think the stress tests are more important than the beta
---
They could probably release the game in a week or two if the servers could handle it 
---
would there be bugs? sure but from what the beta folks are saying they are minor and the experience has been very smooth
---
Lol asmongold ”why would you do this on stream”? As in yeah lets not report this and let them check if its an exploitable bug.
---
same thing happened to me :(
---
You sound autistic bud. Anyone who gets offended by words is weak in my opinion.  Have you ever heard of sticks and stones?
---
Verne troyer is dead btw, RIP
---
The calendar would be a good thing to have.
---
We're only gonna have like a month to fish the summer bass, which I think is used for a spirit food buff. Hoard that for when raiding starts and you could maybe make some bank.
---
Unless I'm getting pushed around, yeah A.
---
Pacific daylight time. Most states in eastern US are on EDT not EST right now. The difference being daylight savings time.
---
Better in the beginning. The population plummeted recently with most people hitting max.
---
But yea the social experience is just astronomically better than retail. Questing is way more dangerous and requires you to sort of play as a team etc.
---
Oh for sure it's a different animal today than just a few years ago. I remember wotlk and cata there were 6 hour queues at peak time.
---
Does that suck? Of course! But blizzard isn't keeping 1 server this time. They should take advantage of their "layering" and make them selectable each with their own queue.
---
I believe doing that will keep the servers community intact while waiting to merge the layers, and be able to turn off the phasing.
---
Phasing shouldn't be a part of the game, it just gives a disgusting feeling when it happens. If I have to sit in queue for 2 hours to assure that there will be zero phasing when I get into the server, I'll gladly wait 4 hours.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yeah no paying extra or anything like that
---
I’m going armor on my warrior for the resist gear. I am staying tank spec full time so I won’t be making an AR. It’s Quel’Serrar or bust for me till BWL patch.  Crusader enchant and I’m ready to dance.
---
lol dude, your so full of shit its hilarious.
---
Just explain this to me like im a 5 year old retard:
---
**If there are 10k people online at the same time 3 months after launch, how do they disable layers while staying within their stated goal of 3k per server?**
---
Following - because I’ve already heard that this is all about the streamers and the personalities keeping it entertaining, I hope that it’s like classic that no matter what quest or where I’m at there’ll be someone else and more social and etc but we’ll see... been playing since vanilla release  off and on and never received a beta :(
---
&gt; fuck off if you think otherwise. ,
---
Well, he did not say "fuck off", which is something to point out these days :P
---
Lol no need to be defensive man. I just mean that that is knowledge most people wouldn't be so open to tell to world.
---
Are people hitting 30 and not playing anymore, or are they leveling an alt?
---
I am unsure whether it was Nighthold or Antorus.
---
However, Blizzard has become very extreme with account sharing. I don't think they ever shared *how* they do it, but they are definitely monitoring closely these days.
---
Sorry for not appreciating ur gamer 4chan culture.
---
EDT
---
Your comment is what makes me really sad. You know nothing of his relationships apart from the small anecdote OP gave.
---
For all you know his grandparents could've been shit ppl for starters.
---
You will have the Option to download it Prior to the release. You will not have to purchase anything additional to the monthly subscription that you Need.
---
So yeah - you can basically Play the second it Comes out :)
---
Played a druid in retail vanilla, and you could definitely not use outdoor abilities in the flag rooms.
---
Does the warrior discord on the google docs work? Can someone DM me the invite link?
---
Thank a lot man. Yeah built it, zephyr doesnt take too much customizing, just getting a new bench done and getting rid of anything extra.
---
Pretty sure sticks and stones is as old as time but okay.
---
The answer is always blue with silver hair
---
So it must be a seasoned Masturbution pala.
---
I've heard stories of people accidently aggroing a mob in their level range and letting themselves get killed just to avoid xp etc
---
Idk how you plan to play 2 classes anytime soon but more power to ya.
---
Exactly. I guess it is pretty hard to predict what it will be like once everyone has access, but I hope that we can get a decent measure by hearing from the more regular people.
---
Unless they change some damage values in Naxx it will be much harder than current imo. You have to remember, only .01% of guilds got to KT in preBC naxx. It was no joke.
---
Even with strategies I think we'll be surprised at how challenging it will be to down content as a whole. You'll have some guilds with knowledgeable and consistent players that blow through it though.
---
[Starting August 12th-13th](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291719/claim-your-character-name-in-classic-character-creation-starts-august-12th-13th) you will be able to download the game and log in to create your character and reserve your name.
---
All you need is a current subscription.
---
You beat him in the open world at level 30 in Vanilla and you can't imagine things being a bit different in another expansion at max level in a generally more balanced game with gear being less of a factor? 
---
Really?
---
&gt;1m 
---
Will probably even be higher than that. And who cares if they quit? Let people play for a bit and leave if they want, a normal player won't even hit 60 in a couple months. You only need what, 3k concurrent players for a server?
---
Naxx wont come out for 2-3 years after release though
---
Where yo? Link me one
---
Thanks for the reply! Yeah my line of thinking as well in terms of usefulness - I guess the thing that makes me come back to the idea of a Shaman is that I can go resto to switch things up a little whereas Lock I’ll be dps regardless of spec. Looks like a lot of fun though :) Both of these classes are perhaps not the most popular ones, which in itself is a bit of an appeal to me. 
---
I mained Rogue in the past (actually an alt that became my main), so while its fun I’m kind of keen on trying something new. Priest looks cool, I have to admit, but with my levelling buddy being one it seems a bit extreme lol. Wouldn’t mind healing though, definitely not opposed to the idea. Is the general priest levelling spec shadow? Would’ve been cool at least if we were different specs.
---
Both are going to be very stressful, so either way you're going to be testing your stress levels.
---
Druids are overall superior if you don‘t play on a minmax guild.
---
Female, 100%
---
Also.. that he played everyday doesn't mean he played all the day. Etc etc. Dont be so quick to assume others situation
---
I regularly got 100-0 in 1.12 with my frost mage. Was pretty easy  because all people ever did on my realm pool was zerging on that long road before the bridge to the alliance base. All you had to do was spam ice barrier, the tab key and frostbolt. Good times lol.
---
Fun fact most people don't know but fiery is actually bis leveling enchant for rogues, it gives a higher dps boost than crusader even at 60 but people use 60 because of all the fire resist mobs in brd/brs/mc/bwl.
---
In my opinion, enabling a way to stop experience gains will flood every bracket with twinks. Whilst not having a way to stop xp discourages this behaviour since it's a risk to.. for example overleveling a lvl 49... and makes it a huge waste of time.
---
No Changes
---
I foolishly believed all the blind Blizzard fanbois would just stay with BFA and leave Classic alone.  Their love of Blizzard knows no bounds.
---
Addons really haven't done that much harm to retail though lol..    
---
      
---
Some addons do give advantages sure, but there's nothing stopping from people downloading it themselves. Things like atlasloot don't make an advantage, questhelpers are an advantage only to yourself (many people just memorize their routes anyway), dbm does of course but that's existed for what, 13+ years without it being baseline.           
---
If people care about those advantages, they'll find the addon and download it, or write an addon themselves. I don't see the issue in people having a choice to do it or not, instead of being a "NO YOU CAN'T CHOOSE, EITHER WE HAVE IT OR WE FORCE IT ON EVERYONE".
---
Undead or orc for horde rogue 
---
for alliance id go gnome
---
healers? well it depends but you cant go wrong with a priest
---
Pallys are amazing single target and provide great buffs
---
Shammys are outstanding raid healers and again great buffs
---
druids.... well solid hots and inveterate
---
As someone who just wrapped up their first year of grad school, this comment made me so jealous.
---
That sounds like it is a bug if blizzard have confirmed that sitting shouldn’t proc effects?
---
You understand there are thousands in beta and only a couple hundred are streamers.
---
So much for “this is a pserver issue only”
---
Just to clarify, do we need the newest release of retail, or simply game time on the account?
---
Or you were waiting to finish work or school to get home and play and you can’t login for 2 hours. Then you have some stuff to do and have to leave. Then you come back and you login again and you get back to queue for another hour. Then you finally get in and it’s nighttime. You play for an hour and then you realize you have to get up in like 6 hours. While all your friends got in 3 hours before you and played for 3-4 hours while you only did 1. So you’re so many levels behind. You hop on r/classicwow and complain about queue’s.
---
Beta doesn't matter. I don't get while ppl want to waste time with it...
---
I'm with you on the 2nd ID.
---
But I will say that it is *impossible* to down Ragnaros within the first ID, assuming you do not do anything that is against the ToS like account sharing.
---
There are just too many variables that can go wrong during a launch week, and that leaves out the fact that the timeframe is already so tight, we are talking about hours if everything goes according to plan.
---
I invite them to prove me wrong, and I'll even give them a small donation if they do.
---
Same :/ even in retail I hate being forced into giant chicken mode to be a spellcaster dps. Glyph of Stars exists but then I just have to be blue all the time. I'd love to just be able to be my Druid as they are for healing/balance. I know shapeshifting is a part of the identity but I feel like it fits feral, it just feels forced and annoying on the other specs for people who maybe don't want to shapeshift so much.
---
THEY WON'T BE ONLINE ALL THE TIME AT THE SAME TIME GOD FUCKING DAMNIT USE YOUR STUPID BRAIN
---
IM DONE HERE
---
If that was what you meant you had a very wierd way of saying it.
---
Lot of retards in here getting triggered because you used the word Autistic.  The absolute state of Reddit.
---
Does this mod offer any functionality beyond what you'd get out of just using WeakAuras2 to create your own swing timer?
---
Well... You have to prove that those are the People that are playing out of nostalgia. If you simply don´t like the game - that is your Thing. 
---
But I would argue that most People that liked the game a lot back then - will like it a lot today as well. Especially the ones that don´t like the current state of wow.
---
I mean of course a lot of retail Players will leave again because it basically is a completely different game :d

Paladin is a lot simpler and has lot of powerful buttons to support the warrior (freedom, bop, cleanse, might/kings, etc.), but priests have a more diverse toolkit and are going to be able to support the warrior in a more traditional sense while having more options for their own gameplay. So if you want to be attached to the hip with your warrior I would say paladin, but if you want to be somewhat independent I'd go priest.
---
1. Orc gets a flat AP cooldown and a stun resist which helps with other rogues, paladins, and warriors. UD gets WotF which helps with fears ofc.
---
2. Human for PvE. +5 sword skill is pretty good. Dwarf or Gnome for PvP. SF (Dwarf) allows you to shed bleeds and poisons for easy restealths and EA (Gnome) allows you to break roots, nova, and other slows.
---
3. All the healing classes (Priest, Paladin, Shaman, &amp; Druid) are good.
---
I have a bad frame of reference here as a former vanilla player from 2004-6. In Vanilla people weren't innately bad or took longer to clear things because of their lack of personal skill but because we lacked so much knowledge across the board about the game.
---
I am guessing classic is going to go a lot smoother for people across the board since quests, dungeons, raids, builds, drops, etc are all so well known and established, if not by you personally, by someone else.
---
Well if you’re planning on playing alliance you can rule one of those options out at least. 😀😀
---
Enhancement was all around pretty bad in classic. Dont think they will change that. You really gotta have off set gear pieces (mostly hunter items)and a big ass axe or mace if you want to do any damage really.
---
You know when someone mentions something and it just sort of "unlocks" a memory you completely forgot about?
---
You just did this for me, instantly remembered sitting in vent while duelling outside org with guildies while we made fun of one of our guildies for saying "toon"
---
Which do you like more? Are you heavy into PvP? Do you mind casting mostly one spell, or do you need more interactivity? Do you want to melee or range? Do you want to have any ranged offensive capabilities such as dispelling buffs and DoT, or do you want to play more defensively? 
---
On paper, I would be picking a paladin myself...except I just love playing priest. It's easily more fun despite what I think it has for weaknesses vs. paladin. So, what you LIKE is the most important decision. If it's 50/50 and you really don't care, then probably paladin is the best healer TBH.

Hey. I was wondering how good druids really are after all now that it's sort of clear that mobs indeed deal less damage than most people realized. Crushing blows/def skill was the biggest obstacle for druid tanking in raids while their armor and threat generation is amazing. If it's really true that mobs hit less, then doesn't that mean that druids would be more than viable for main tanking unless there are some fear mechanisms? I've heard stories that private servers have increased the boss damage just because those servers lack mechanics and the overall difficulty in vanilla is really quite low. Accounting those, would druid become a superior tank compared to warrior if all the fear mongering is coming from private servers?
---
hunters always top tier in pvp.
---
also NE &gt; dwarf for hunter, shadowmeld is like 10 second cooldown which is so good along with stealthed cat.
---
This. Blizzard would do an open beta if they really really really were concerned about bugs. Or they'd get people they pay to test for bigs and they do this internally.
---
What they want is for a variety of different players to play the game and see what happens in their daily WoW routines. Not necessarily sit there for 3 hours trying to see if they can find a weird backstab angle.
---
Yup. Temporary Layering beats the hell out of not playing.
---
Speed Zanza, Swiftness Potion, Skull of Impending Doom, Nifty Stopwatch.
---
When I didn't know what the shit I was doing while playing my Rogue I would always have trouble with Hunters.
---
I definitely don't want dual speccing, hybrid speccing and not having to completely change all the time is one thing I loved about old WoW. In retail my friends and guild don't understand why I'm always so annoyed having to change spec, but it's just how it is for me.
---
For me it would probably just be something like giving Druids a proper rez. I wanna play resto but that's my only real worry. It's making me wonder whether taking engineering might even be worth it just for the chance of using jumper cables. But then that's gonna annoy me having to have a profession I don't really want on my Druid.
---
Sure but there's more people on this sub than the stats say cleared naxx, yet it seems like every other poster claims they were top tier raider. Private servers obviously took the place of the experience for some people. It becomes apparent who is parroting shit when you hear the number of people talking about reaching level 60 in the first week.
---
I think that is a pretty narrow-minded view of the process. Beta provides feedback to all interested parties, generates interest, it has created a bizarre lvl 30 meta that is pretty entertaining, and it irons out a lot of issues that would otherwise make the release experience a lot worse.
---
To me the burnout is going to come from the frustration of being "on the bubble" so to speak with over crowded realms.  It happened to me on "unauthorized" servers in the past.  When I log on I want to do something.  Even if it doesn't accomplish anything I want to feel like I'm doing something in the world.  Trying (and mostly failing) to tag quest mobs in the shimmering flats for 3 hours while barely making any progress doesn't satisfy that.  I end up feeling like I need to grind or do an instance to get out of the crowd but then I know if I just get to the next zone maybe there will be less competition, and if I go do an instance the xp will be slow enough that even more people will be competing with me when I get out.  If you're ahead of the "bubble" or make a character a year later this isn't really an issue.
---
we crave a taste of the game we love
---
even if its just an appetizer before the main course
---
It's ok dude! We're getting a second chance!
---
Come back in 3 months and tell us how small the number is.
---
I mained a rogue back in Vanilla as well but since then, trying out every other class, I'm more into the idea of having the option of different roles as well so I feel you on that!
---
I think shaman is the class I have the least amount of experience with so I'm going to defer that to someone who knows more than me (sorry!) but for priest, shadow is a great leveling spec, you will be melting mobs and (I didn't do this but have heard) at one point you can AoE farm as holy with holy nova (again hopefully a priest main can correct me if I'm wrong)
---
The biggest issue I can see with you going priest is sharing gear with your priest buddy, you guys will be going for the same exact pieces and that'll make it very difficult. If you went shaman, you will barely compete with either of your buddies for gear.
---
Are you planning on levelling blacksmithing as you level or are you going to power through it once at 60?
---
I play horde...
---
/cry
---
It won't affect me as I rarely do BGs while leveling, but if something like that would be implemented, it would make twinking too easy instead of an actual difficulty. All the brackets would be flooded with twinks, and players wanting a change from their perceived monotonous leveling grind would have a bad time. 
---
Let's face it. Doesn't feel good in random whites and greens as a level 25, facing off against a 2000g invested level 29 rogue :p
---
Yeah I understand it will be difficult to play 2 classes at a time. I guess its actually that I want to play either a rogue or a healer in classic instead of them both simultaneously. 
---
I'm more familiar with the human starter zones so if I go alliance against that would be the character I would like to start with.
---
I'm rolling a warrior to mostly tank at end game and I've only got 2-3 hours a day.
---
100% :) 
---
Really hope they have plans to directly reduce phasing to as close to zero as possible by launch!
---
Played at release. Was in the air force and our base had a ton of 18-20 newbies who all ended up getting the game. Was a blast to play with a dozen people you actually know irl. 
---
Played off and on until wrath
---
1. Fun Leveling Experience
---
2. World PvP
---
3. BGs
---
4. Dungeons
---
5. Raids
---
In that order.....you have selected:   MAGE.
---
Enjoy!
---
It kinda was compared to current raids. The reason no one got to KT really was because of limiting factors like dreadnaught gear, and a short tier with an expansion looming and the cutting of raid sizes really kinda put above average guilds that normally would get the content done after the top 50 to a 100 quit until the next expansion.
---
The mechanics of the fights just are not al that challenging compared to now.
---
I'm in Joana's discord, the consenus seems to be about 5-10% slower because of the quest item drops and better AI. Mana regen seems to only be different for 1-10.
---
I always went for 6 or 9. They felt like the most different. I never liked the others because they're just so intoxicatingly green I feel like I look like a giant booger. I liked 6 for the almost blackrock orc kinda look, and 9 just because it felt different.
---
Yea I know. It bums me out a little. Still it will be non-cross-realm which is a huge improvement. And it won't have reinforcements, so the game only ends when the boss is killed (not when 300 or however many players died)
---
It's not the worst version but as I said it does bum me out that they didn't go with a more classic'y version.
---
Hunters are very good in BGs at any stage.  AV is your playground.  1v1 - They are strong vs casters in general, but mages and locks can out burst you if you are not careful.  But they get eaten alive by Rogues and Warriors.  Given that in vanilla, you cannot attack targets within 1-8 meters with your range weapon, your only options against melee is to wing cling, trap, and run away.
---
How?
---
theres literally not much different in them  except the universe they take place in.
---
Both are fantasy, both have multiple races and multiple classes, both have deep lore, both are medieval with magic, both are RPG, both have leveling/battlegrounds/raids.
---
Theres not much differences between them unless you start pulling on details. The weapon talents in ESO are pretty much their equivalant of weapon skills in classic, much better rewards but still functions exactly the same way.
---
DAMMIT BEAVITH
---
First off you know options 2 and 3 are respectively horde and alliance only, but I think in regards to what you are looking for shaman would be your best bet. Shamans have a variety of specs that allow them to do different things while still remaining a powerful support class. Prot/ret paladin isn't much of a thing unless you have a guild to feed you gear, shadow priest is really more of a hobby than a viable offspec, but for shaman you can definitely spec 30/0/21 and be a burst caster /pvp support, 0/22/29 is the standard raid spec once you have gear and allows you to use 2 handers (for nightfall weaving), and ofc you can always spec to be more of a dedicated healer. Hope this helps, I'm a little biased with horde though so, keep that in mind =).
---
Yeah that makes sense about healers. I probably should have phrased it better/been more specific. 
---
Looking to heal in PvP and was thinking of Nelf Resto druid.
---
And firemage is just spam fireball over and over, too, unless you're on scorch duty which then gives you 2 buttons.
---
Ah I hear ya, only reason I'd objectively do dps over healer is the fact that you won't have to respec as much as a healer (unless you permanently stay heal spec while playing with others)
---
Hunter is top tier pvp always, leveling though it’s in another stratosphere. The damage falloff for pve is most noticeable post bwl. You are still decent damage just can’t keep up with top tier for pve
---
Silly post. You know all these are true from peoples experience on OG vanilla and pservers, who cares about a 300 pop level 30 beta.
---
Wrath was my favorite. But I absolutely admit that I cannot separate the things I liked about Wrath from the simple fact that I also enjoyed my characters because of the memories I made in classic and burning Crusade and that made the playing of those characters even more special. Can't separate those things. No point in trying.
---
Hunter scale kinda ok in pvp, the tier sets are kinda good for pvp so you dont have to rank, thats super nice.
---
Imo you should allways go Nelf a Nelf hunter has just so mutch more Options and it is the only class that uses Nelf this well.
---
Hunter is good at any stage of the game, in pvp that is, because your plan to win is rarly i do more dmg then they do.
---
You will struggle or allmost feel worthless in duels if you are not very very good at your class and know what to equip when.
---
In Open pvp and 1v1 there its looking abit diffrent with open space to kite it makes hunters stronger and scary for most classes if you can atleast play abit.
---
Mage is in so many words "the god class" they can really do it all and do it all well. If I was going into Classic blind and was playing solo, I'd roll mage for sure.
---
Same here, it wasnt like this at start tho. I think the game masters had some part on in the talks after ppl complained because there were like L1 alts in kazzak that ppk got killed there.. Ofc before a pull you could PVP as much as you wanted ( and we did, a lot ).
---
Every game except Hearthstone (single player content and once in a while Rogue/Warrior decks, managing resources and using combos is fun for me) and programming my own game engine. Other than playing the game I find myself watching beta streams  too much and being sad that I can't play classic yet. I decided not to try my chances anyway because I would definitely burn off from playing beta. I am also having some thoughts that I would love to play remake of Warcraft 3 already.
---
Not going super hardcore but want to tank...well you can still warrior and tanks will be needed for 5s to get your blue preBiS gear.  If you want to avoid the time/gold sink and still want to tank 5s and have some raid tanking duties...if you can stand healing also, go druid HOTW spec 0/30/21.
---
Paladin vs Shaman. How are holy/resto in wpvp? As in, will I just get ganked constantly? With resto/else spec do I have any chance of defense? Is one a bit easier on the gold grind?
---
one of the reasons i choose skinning. or create a Group where i the only skinner.
---
I don't remember vanilla dungeons being difficult in a hard-hitting sense if you had the appropriate gear, level, and spec. Only some bosses or mobs were designed to simply hit like a truck.
---
Where vanilla dungeons got hard is from large packs and accidental pulls. However if you have a talented group that can manage crowd control and not face pull, vanilla dungeons are pretty easy, and you feel rewarded for playing well.
---
What generally happens though is someone breaks a crowd control or pulls a patrol. Then your group gets overwhelmed and your healer needs to spam heals. This generates a ton of threat that surpasses what the tank can generate across multiple mobs. Healer then gets beat down and you wipe.
---
So it's not a "wow this encounter is tough" in a large sense but "stand the fuck back and don't face pull you idiots". You're battling your group more than the mobs sometimes.
---
Also, they're doing level 40 content and below. Wait til the higher level dungeons where there are far more mobs and patrols to deal with.
---
I would imagine undead have the quickest walk to a major city.
---
It's a huge gamble. Either you're the first person on the server with Arcanite Reaper recipe and you capitalize on that (requires friends to run LBRS with you endlessly), or you're the first person on the server with Lionheart Helm recipe and you capitalize on that (requires a raid guild, priority on the recipe, and a lot of luck).
---
Yes, you are right.
---
Well it is, because it's not the same as the way it works on private servers at all. 
---
Private server is simply crit = procc.
---
This is sit = crit = no procc - but if you sit to get crit, and stand at the right time so the server doesn't see you're sitting, then it proccs.
---
cant go wrong with a druid in pvp, so versatile and mobile

yeah i know they're stronger in the 1.12 patch thats why I mentioned, I dont think we're starting off with a 1.12 server on classic they said it was starting out like it was in 2004 unless they mentioned it otherwise. yeah in my original comment i mentioned the mid tarren mill and stv, yeah they're good world pvp class but still weak until the higher levels. prolly say around 38ish is when damage started to kick up pretty good and then the mid 40s was even better and so on...etc...and then with gear you become almost immortal.
---
The clueless heards are back baby.
---
Saw Asmon whining about getting stream sniped and camped too. No sympathy for either of them, sorry. 
---
I've been camped many many times over the years. The difference is I don't have a legion of zoomers mailing and trading me gold and consumables and giving me preference on loot and in Asmon's case carrying my ass through anything of note I've ever done in over a decade of playing. 
---
It's the price they pay for making a living doing this, and generally not having to put in the same effort as everyone else. 
---
At least Soda is a very accomplished player, but he absolutely also has a massive entitlement complex where he expects people to give him what he wants.
---
Hunters were a pain in the arse if you didn't have a way to get close to them, which many classes didn't. If you were the one getting the jump then yeah, they could be in trouble. That's why standing on your own frost trap was reasonable insurance against melee gankers.
---
From that, I think my Horde choice would be UD, my ally choice would be human/dwarf and I should probably learn more about the different healing classes before I make a choice.
---
Grinding while listening to music would be fun regardless of taking adderall. People are making it sound more amazing than it is. People will be excited about release without adderall. It's not going to take you to some next level shit of pleasure. It will help you stay awake and not eat though.
---
I didnt feel like going on to a big long explanation of my feelings lol. Was just a quick comment, didnt mean it as offensive. Everyone here (myself included) has no lifed wow.
---
Just meant that most dont go on promoting how hardcore they no lifed it.
---
You don't need to be a rocket scientist to backsolve for armor.
---
It always makes me happy seeing people able to recover their accounts!
---
Have fun with the nostalgia. :)
---
Oof
---
Hunters lose 1v1s with warriors?
---
Hunters: don't you just auto attack it?
---
Dwarf and Gnome are both better for different pvp situations, but if you're competitive you can play night elf and consider it a "neutral race" and seek to outplay your opponents. At the end of the day, play whatever you will have the most fun on and kick some ass.
---
Kevin Jordan confirmed they had dynamic respawns, I don't remember where tho.
---
Where do you get early mc they are better than warriors?
---
Yes they may have good pre-raid gear. They get crushed either way as a MT though. They can´t block, can´t parry, not as much defense so crushing can´t be pushed off the table. Also they don´t have as many situational spells.
---
I mean I agree that it is defenitely viable but I would argue that early mc a warrior tank is still superior for most fights (as a MT)
---
They won't have instant respawns like bfa at launch or private servers but there will be dynamic respawns.
---
Example is - you walk intona camp of 15 mobs and start killing 1 at a time... the respawns should be 5 minutes each.
---
Or you start killing 1 and 3 other people show up and start killing their own... the faster the mobs drop the quicker they will respawn, but it will be closer to 2-3 minutes instead of 5.
---
It's all fine, don't worry.
---
Have higher levels clear the dungeons to the boss and get the loot. It will be some exp but would take a while to level. You’d have time to get your gear you need. Start it at a lower level like 10 to make sure you get them all.
---
Not so much a what should I play, but how should I play.  
---
I have a lot of friends that want to play, though I've narrowed myself down to a pretty small group. Now we all agreed we'll all go at our own pace even if it means so people get left behind however, I'm thinking just so people in the group don't get salty, should I have a main that levels somewhat around their level or with them and then a solo alt, or should I just focus on my main (looking at shaman, but have subtle feelings about priest) and do professions in my spare time?
---
So you are in fact a part of the "lots of players will quit, and if they don't we don't have a Plan B" camp.
---
Cool, you and Blizzard think alike.
---
It was made in 2004. I remember seeing it in 2004, tard
---
Just game time.
---
Probably along with side mining as I level
---
I remember I was a kid and went to do BFD on my warrior. I never had anyone to teach me anything about the game so I didn't even really know how dungeons were really meant to work, with a tank and healer and such. So I just signed up to be a tank thinking oh yeah that just means I pull the things right, and turned up there with my whirlwind axe, shitty armour and no shield. The rest of the group were pretty confused asking where my shield was and I told them I didn't know I needed one lmao. I wasn't even specced into prot at all I think, I was just arms. We still did okay though luckily and got through it.
---
Pretty sure it even said new subs won't count to get an invite, didn't it? So, assuming I'm remembering it right, it's not a money grab. It's just saying current players will get chosen outside of the obvious media invites.
---
Shaman. If you don't have a bunch of min/maxers up your ass about not having mana tide (not that big of a deal IMO anyway), then go 30/0/21 and heal......and blow some motherfuckers up in PvP. Thank me later.
---
&gt;still deflecting because you can't make an actual argument  
---
truly sad
---
Originally very few players got to experience nax I'm pretty sure alot more will be able to do it this time around. As for how hard the raids are going to be I don't know, mc and ontxia will be really easy. They always where. Bwl will probably be fairly easy aswell. When it comes to aq40 and nax we will have to see. Main problem is we have alot of our data from private servers and we simply don't know what if any of it is correct. Content might be a breeze compared to privet severs it may also be harder if we look at the data we do have levelling seems to be harder and low level dungeons seems to be easier there just is no way of knowing. I wouldn't expect really hard content. When vanilla was live it was in an age where ppl where not that experienced whit mmorpg the main philosophy in endgame revolved around treath and keeping tank alive the individual skill level for most fights is pretty low it gets higher the further you get but it is still low. The time commitment on the other side is insane
---
It’s been all positive. Lots of spontaneous grouping for elite mobs or kill quests. Lots of LfG requests in chat.   Tons of drive by heals and buffs. 
---
People going out of their way to be helpful.  You’ll see people making bags for folks just for mats and cost just to be helpful.
---
Recently - Fallout 76. There have been a few others.
---
500 days played between 2004-2009. It’s a lot, but it’s spread out I’d imagine.
---
If you have limited time how does bringing bad dps help?
---
He's a clown. To his credit he's accomplished things in the game without being carried by his subs, but he's still extremely insecure, arrogant, and entitled.
---
gnome was my second choice so might consider that too . Thanks!
---
this looks like something a hordie would think was totally badass
---
Yeah that was what I was thinking as well gear wise, unless the stats are different between shadow and holy. Ah man maybe I should just go full dps and roll warlock lol. But wouldn’t the gear issue be the same in that case between priest and lock?
---
Classic unrewarding? Are we talking about the same classic or did you mean retail?
---
nah not in
---
resource dynamic respawns make it much much easier to make all the flasks and every profession thing . 
---
mobs would make it much faster to power level and farm gold
---
most people are just looking for something as close to vanilla as possible
---
I haven't tested that enough. I tried finding a good post about the science behind it but couldn't find anything so I went with a slightly altered version of  how this handles parry haste . 
---
[https://github.com/EinBaum/SP\_SwingTimer](https://github.com/EinBaum/SP_SwingTimer) 
---
What mine does is checks to see if you're timer has less than 20% of its swing time left.
---
If its under 20% then nothing happens but if its over 20% then it sets the remaining swing time to 20%.
---
So two comments ago you said the 40s was what you mentioned when saying they were weak and now your saying that’s when they ramp up? Lol give up dude you are wrong. Their a top tier 1v1 class the whole game. Great for world pvp at all levels. Also we are starting with 1.12 talents and itemization they are only gating progression content in phases. Probably shouldn’t argue a subject If you don’t even know what version of classic is being released lol.
---
Ahh you're right, I didn't think about the 1.12 values.
---
Unfortunately I've lost all my old screenshots with a hard drive crash, but we did have a history page from the high guard guild, maybe you recognize some names!

I so rarely get to hear those words lol
---
I don't. My current [battle.net](https://battle.net) account isn't actually my original one so I figured I wouldn't get any preference for an invite. Frankly I am just taking these next couple of months to brush up on some information and plan on what I am going to do with my character, hell I am not even 100% sure what class I am playing.
---
Everywhere, according to him.
---
Lol ok kid.
---
No, that was the hell on earth that was classic strath
---
Little kinda related warlock noob story. I was a really nooby kid and had no idea how the talent trees worked, I just saw the cool final talents and thought I had to save up my talent points to buy them. I didn't realise it meant I had to spend that amount beforehand. I thought the final abilities literally cost 30 talent points, so I went around for a long, long time with 0 talents. No wonder I found everything so hard.
---
I mean idk if you are aware but Hunters have minimum range where they can use their ranged weapon.
---
They do have some melee abilities but if you think you'll beat a warrior or rogue with just melee,  ggwp!
---
Except on pservers you didn’t have to time it it just worked. Iirc it was working in this fashion even after they removed it in retail.
---
Can you PM me which one?
---
Yeah gnome gives you counterplay against a lot of pesky CC abilities, most notably since everyone knows that engy is good now a days you are going to be vs 1000 net-o-matics.
---
&gt;I’ll mainly be playing solo on alliance
---
Um...maybe I haven't had enough coffee yet, but if you're playing alliance then Shaman is not an option. Otherwise, it's awesome.  Also, don't NOT play a class because of population. **Play what you like!** You'll figure out a way to get done what you need.
---
Probably right. Still annoying.
---
Wanted to be one but had to accept pretty soon that the math is too hard for me and I didn't really have the motivation to work hard enough to overcome that!
---
I think you may have mis read, I said the 40s is when they got strong. I think your private server warlock alt experience is getting you mixed up. 
---
and they clearly stated it was starting out like it was in 2004 so I highly doubt it starts at 1.12 lol and if talents and itemization are gated then warlock will be even weaker lmao. you probably shouldn't argue private server stats.
---
You seem to be pretty defensive of what is likely an unhealthy relationship with video games. I play a bunch too dude, but saying you can’t enjoy a vacation without downloading wow to play on a subpar computer? There’s plenty of context there.
---
It can't proc off Storm strike either right?
---
I raided as resto during retail vanilla, thinking of changing it up now though
---
I'm really salty that they didn't get reformed out before classic
---
Wasn't this originally fixed when that Paladin one-shot Doomlord Kazak by limiting the number of reckoning stacks and having them fall off over time?
---
Still dos not mean reckoning will be playable, atleast for pvp.
---
We dont know if you can mount with stacks, and we dont know if cc will remove stacks.
---
And its kinda likely that both things will remove stacks that will make reckoning usless. 
---
I guess kinda good for Warris to get the dmg proc.
---
Cant argue with that lol
---
In the original client. They don't seem to be present in the Classic beta. Weird position for Blizz.
---
me too
---
but im happy playing the old version
---
Yeah in vanilla Slam would reset your attack timer.

The guy joined a raid whose sole purpose was to get him the trinket. Plus he flamed soda after in whispers. Seemed justified really.
---
My dude, that early troll's blood elixir that alchemist's craft is absolutely nuts at low levels if you're playing a warrior. I remember leveling my warrior in the early days and that thing allowed me to chain pull without needing to heal after every fight, not to mention the number of tough fights I survived with like 2% HP instead of dying because I was rockin' troll's blood.
---
They announced that they are making a collector's edition. So there will be a physical version, but it's going to be time limited. But dont think they will do a non collector's edition physical version
---
To me too cannot restore my mage lvl 60. Stoped before bc and i think before true battelnet.:-)
---
It didn't work like this in real vanilla so it kind of is.
---
&gt;(which wasn't even possible in Vanilla) and forcing raid members to use every available consumable (which also wasn't possible).
---
Not true though. Nihilum had full world buffs on their first KT kill.
---
Sick distraction, rofl.
---
People remember how it was back in the day... Nobody had a clue and that made it hard. Now, everybody knows where to put talents, what BIS gear to get and how the mechanics work  of course it makes it easier. It's still more of a challenge than retail.
---
1-10 decent, 11-29 dead, 30 decent.
---
There are no cons for PvP.  PvE they are not viable. Suggest going 30/0/21 and healing for PvE, and then do whatever you want for PvP and it will be worth it.
---
All is well and good as long as they listen. If they just ignore advice and go bananas, they are getting the boot. This time around my time is too limited to play coach.
---
Thanks. I stand corrected.
---
I can understand you feeling betrayed and salty. I'd love for nothing more than playing the beta too.
---
That being said - if you invite a streamer who doesn't play WoW, haven't played classic.. but have a reasonable audience.. what do you think that audience normally plays/watch? I doubt it's WoW.
---
Now you've sent this person an invite. The streamer couldn't care less about WoW - but wait a minute.. it's so popular, this may boost viewership and reach more people to expand the audience! Even if the streamer has no interest, there's a gain to be had there. 
---
Now from blizzards point of view they just reached a new audience for the price of.. nothing. And what happens if that streamer who tries it for the first time ends up loving it and completely comes over? Likely a few of the streamers spergs will join in when the streamer starts. Now blizzard gets a return for their investment of nothing. That's free money!
---
What if the streamer didn't like it/didn't enjoy it? - doesn't matter. Classic has reached a point it can't be criticized anymore. So they didn't get the audience they didn't have in the first place, big deal.  It didn't cost them anything - and if they lack beta testers they press a button and a few more will get an email. 
---
TL:DR - free promotion to an audience blizzard didn't already have.
---
Blizz is prone to making bad decisions on these things. They removed WSG wall jumping which was required an elite level of skill. The game has lost a huge part of its quirkiness with the removal of those jumps.
---
It's no different than the 12 melee dps fighting over the same items or the 12 caster dps fighting over the same items. If you want to be defaulted gear you need to be the main tank or the first off tank. 
---
It's not much of an issue with a 2-3 year time line, I was able to get full t1, t2 and t2.5 on the current pserver I play on and it's not even a year old.
---
People like having big collections of mounts, and growing said collection.
---
People like being able to use a mount they farmed for X months/years on whatever char they are playing on.
---
Personally I don't see the downside on the mount collection. But I also don't care about collecting mounts so...
---
TLDR, so mobs in classic are hitting for less or more than pserver?
---
But you need fire resistance gear. Without at least some resistance, especially during the later bosses, the numbers will be so high that you can kiss your ass goodbye,
---
Script kiddie, lol.
---
&gt; The rogue video has an upload date of 12 Feb 2007 which is early TBC but if you look at TBC patch notes the only patch that is documented to have changed anything regarding dungeons is patch 2.1.2 which came half a year later! 
---
where are you looking for that patch notes? [the official patch notes are gone](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/8-1-5). the unofficial ones can be edited by anyone.
---
Would be interesting to know crowded a place has to be in order to feel a difference in spawnrate.
---
Make it a month and changing points in each spec requires individual respec and contributes towards the 50 gold limit.
---
Also its costs 1k gold like it was originally
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if he met her through WoW
---
Hey, living in Berlin here. What's this magical provider ?
---
It's always rough when leveling with others but if I'm being honest (even after everything I said), just play what you really want without worrying about leveling with them because you wont 100% always play with them, I assume at least lol, and in that case you'd want to enjoy your time.
---
It can proc off SS, just not other windfury procs. That’s the only change. It doesn’t affect PVE dps overall as much as it effects pvp burst and kill potential, but they did still take a hit on that end. The biggest problem is trying to get gear as enhance.
---
Hahahah, running out of arrows mid-dungeon was fun/embarrassing. Even worse was your pet abandoning you because you don't have the right food for it and it died like 15 times already :)))
---
paladin tank.
---
Yep. There are equivalent dps weapons that drop out of 5 man dungeons that are much lower effort and much lower cost. The 1.12 demonshear from live strat is a beast and is a common drop. It will also be available phase 1 and doesn't cost half an epic mount in mats to make.
---
Oh yeah? One of the best? So no way I can name 10 objectively better PvP specs, right?
---
I'll be jelly of all the noobs 
---
luckily I experienced very little high level content and I never did the private server thing 
---
so ill be noobish in some ways too
---
Is this pasta?
---
It’s not about the download size I would just like to have a physical box to put in my collection. Oh well
---
No, if you pug MC you cant be too picky. You cant have only warriors/Rogues/Mages/priest and some niche classes. To get a full raid you need to take what you can find.
---
Dont worry mate
---
Male, female models look potato.
---
Asmongold’s mom.
---
&gt;Doesn't matter. Insane private server players will still claim that it's wrong and that there's some huge conspiracy.
---
It actually infuriates me how this subreddit has been telling everyone that private servers are too easy for a year, and now that it turns out to be the other way around you guys pretend like pserver players are the one whining.
---
The font is called Lifecraft, but I also put a bunch of layer styles on it to make it look similar to the WoW logo font
---
NO TBC
---
So I was mostly right :p
---
My point was that most of the raids, Naxx excluded, will be clearable by most of the community over time. You'll have guilds of all ranges casual-hardcore with the former that will struggle with MC/getting a 40 man together or, the latter, blow through each raid as it releases.
---
The reason I still put a small % in Naxx is due to the damage values that Naxx had. Unless they modify the damage that certain bosses do we'll still see a lot of guilds struggle even when fully geared for the raid (which in itself is a challenge with 40 people and 3 drops per boss).
---
MMO players sneered at WoW when it released because it was a carebear MMO that was easy and had no penalties for dieing. Think of your Ultima Online, Everquest, DAOC players at the time.
---
15 years later people are remembering it was "difficult". 
---
I think this more than likely comes from players who were really young and or this was their first MMO.
---
Depends on your goals.
---
1) For pve orc and troll is better, for pvp orc and undead is best. 
---
2) For pve human is best but it's not a big deal since dagger rogues are a thing, for pvp gnome and dwarf is best.
---
3) Honestly they are all really good except druid(until later). Problem with druids is that HoT's don't stack, so having more than 1 druid is considered bad.
---
No, you're literally doing this wrong. You can't downrank a class on the PvP tier list because "they are the worst levelers" and other completely unrelated PvE things.
---
Fact remains, warriors are S tier at PvP because they dominate in battlegrounds.
---
&gt;As a general rule, warrior lose to all in pvp
---
Only in duels. They lose to nothing in battlegrounds lol.
---
He's become self aware of how boring the stream is
---
ENFP-a or t, planning on playing a warrior and leading a guild as main tank.
---
Not too sure if I agree with the result, several things I said contradict this but alas it's just the 16 pers. Test nothing binding.
---
My dad never played WoW with me but he would definitely play other games with me, he liked gaming so it was definitely easy for him to bond with me through gaming, he just wasn't much of a player of MMO games. Now I have my own son (only 11 months old) I am definitely going to introduce him to gaming in the same way as he gets older. Maybe he will play WoW one day, if it's still going.
---
Im getting too old for this lol
---
Been suggested before
---
opinions on the subject vary
---
I'd advice to watch Preach's 26 min video on the matter. 
---
You're not forced to play it. If you have a WoW sub, try it out. Might as well get bang for your buck right?
---
&gt;I somewhat fear that this will translate into quite a hostile environment in-game for new players/people that haven't played vanilla since ... well... vanilla.  
---
&gt;So, i would like to ask you veterans to keep this in mind when you group up for dungeons, especially low level ones like RFC and WC and DM. Not everyone will know the dungeons and remember routes etc. Not everyone will be fully comfortable/knowledgeable about their class/role etc. If you remember that's how we all were back in the vanilla days.  
---
&gt;So before you rage at :
---
Just give people a heads up about most of that stuff, don't think ive ever seen someone get pissy over something like this unless some idiot startes a dungeon escort quest before everyone can get it, or clicks everything they see like in BFD.
---
I had multiple twinks and never remember doing anything this drastic 
---
Normally would just pay someone to clear out WC or VC for me or just got the BOE’s
---
I understand, but it has to make economic sense. They need to be able to sell enough to make the production run profitable, and there most likely aren't enough of you for that. I'm honestly shocked they even had a BfA physical release, and am 99% sure they won't for the next one, at least not a standard.
---
There is always the possibility there might be some kind of collectors edition, but I think the anniversary set that was released was intended to cover that.
---
BC and Wrath added so many things that in the end, ruined wow. NO THANKS.
---
Lately I've been digging the purple and blue hairs, but I think green will fit my druid best.
---
On pservers you dont need fireres gear because the fire pulse has never worked on pservers. We can expect it to work on classic, along with many other mechanics that existed in vanilla but never in pservers.
---
nah i only have TBC and i'm in beta
---
I agree but I didn't mean to suggest the bug reporting isn't important, I reckon that's still the primary reason they do these long beta tests in the first place. My point was just that to do this level of testing you don't need dedicated testers, you just need players who can click a "Report a bug" button whenever they see something they think qualifies.
---
The best way to cover all the possible content Warcraft has to offer is to invite a wide variety of players, so that as many interactions as possible gets covered. If then only 40% of beta testers report bugs then that's a fact they'll have to compensate for, by either inviting more people or by breaking down available content in order to force a kind of focus. Blizzard has, to the best of my understanding, more often done the latter rather than the former.
---
No changes.
---
The random seasonal mode is great fun, just rolled a sinister strike/evis with immolate and fireblast, then got one of clarity for my 20 skill, also got charge and Sprint along the way, super fun champion. Speccing into fire talents as I get access to them.
---
No I dont think they should stop XP. This wasnt in vanilla, so meant that those wanting to twink, had to get help and be very careful they didnt level.  
---
Twinking was great fun, even when XP was in the game. I'd regularly level a char to 12 and use all my heirlooms and then just play the 10-14 WSG for several days, sometimes even jumping out of a BG before we won to avoid max xp gain. Was great fun, and I Had to plan it well. Locking XP, in my opinion, is the wrong way to go about it.
---
I want to play warrior because I loved filling the tank role in vanilla, but I remember repair costs always drug me down. Are there any good gold farming options for a casual warrior player? Are gathering professions basically it?
---
I meant more like from DC etc. Thought DCs aren't as bad as they were in vanilla.
---
Netcologne, regional one for NRW. Been waiting way too long already, hybrid LTE is the worst type of internet connection one can have next to straight up wifi to some antenna...
---
Idk about Berlin, but you might be lucky with something by Unitymedia being offered at your place.
---
Thats why iam the Fury-Tank, ill tell fist what to do, rest is up to them. Ill lead the way and give cc-targets thats all.
---
Als long they dont fuck up all the time...like hunter aimshot misspulls, unnecessary fears, wipes and so on, everything is fine.
---
We got more than half the time since the beta came out to the launch. At any point in there (probably the last 30 days or so) they could open the beta to anyone subbed. It'll boost their audience, give everyone the bone they're salty about, and give them a closer representation of the playerbase numbers. For right now I'm just thinking of the beta as behind the scenes advertisement type things.
---
Lol I just told you I played in 2004 I’m not talking private servers. Although I’m confused on what you think they changed that make lock feel so different. Talents and itemization aren’t gated only content. We are getting 1.12 with phased releases of dungeons raids and the pvp system. Warrior is utter garbage at pvp until they get WW axe or they have a pocket healer even then casters destroy them lol. That’s all I needed to know about your pvp experience. Enjoy classic my dude. Also quit projecting private server crap on me. My experience is og wow.
---
sounds like a good plan :D
---
I would say great. The have the Chance to correct all the BS they have done and make it good this time
---
i just wont invite them , they bloody roll on everything they can equip
---
im half joking
---
I hope to jebus he comes back for classic!
---
3851 Mobs if the mobs are your level,  2940 if they are level 60. However long that much farming takes you (I'd suggest getting dark runes in Felwood.)

---
Pet experience bar is 1/4 full level for reference.
---
I haven't seen anyone argue that a raid team should have many hunters. 2-4 is enough. That doesn't change the fact that a raid without hunters would be worse. In fact, it would probably wipe a lot easier to BWL bosses.
---
Yeah fair point! I guess I have a few months to mull it over anyway until release :)
---
That was anticlimactic.  I was expecting some more emotion.
---
Or wife agro, no amount of technological progress will make that one go away.
---
I’d rather just keep playing classic until blizz makes a new mmo that doesn’t suck.
---
That's pretty misleading if you're talking about n. Dale. 3k was the absolute minimum during off hours, and it would regularly have 9k at peak and up to 11k when Naxx dropped.
---
It won't. The Classic community is WAY to divided on "what comes next" ... and there has to be SOMETHING that comes next. This won't keep 5 million players for 5 years.
---
What's the best way to kill an MMO? Kill it's community. Blizzard successfully did that once already. And they will do it again once they start adding content to Classic or launching TBC/WotLK servers...
---
Classic will be an absolute BLAST and I plan to play it for quite a bit, but I just don't see it overtaking retail at all.
---
HOWEVER, it can *inform* how retail is handled. Probably the only thing they can at this point, though (since you can't close pandora's box and put LFR and LFD and flying away), is a major overhaul of player characters. Make unique specs, with real talent trees and character customization. Still... no community, no MMO.
---
Someone? Lmao you’re cool.
---
people who use omegalul should be cast out of  normal society
---
My account was hacked too in 2012 and I didn't gave a fuck, it was blocked and I recovered it some days ago out of curiosity/nostalgia. The problem is: My characters were 60, with 60 equipment and I actually played a lot of Burning Crusade with both my characters and I'm sure my Druid was 70 when I quit back then. 
---
For some reason they recovered my account in a state pre-TBC, which is actually awesome. hahahaha

---
They didn't announce that. The closest thing to a collectors edition is the 15 year anniversary.
---
Every. Day.
---
Lol true. I didn't have a wife or a baby back in vanilla so this time around will definitely be different!
---
These short cinematics are expensive as fuck for 2-3 minute clips.
---
They still should've opted for full blown cgi, even if it isn't on par with the cinematics
---
It most certainly affects gameplay and the goal is blizzlike I guess so no.
---
But with that aside.. It's a hard one. 
---
On one hand having no way to stop exp is a cool thing, you have to plan out your character wisely so you get your gear without getting too much experience. But on the other hand, having a exp cap would allow people to twink without getting boosted. You could essentially just farm the gold and do the dungeons you need etc. without ever needing a main, which is also cool.
---
But locking exp is not a huge deal since you don't get exp from bg's, it just affects how you make your twink that's all.
---
&gt;Part of me thinks that armor specialization might have more opportunities to make gold by selling the resist gear to guilds.
---
Guilds will have their own blacksmiths for this, so it may not be worth counting on.
---
I don't watch the streamers so I don't know if my memory of vanilla lines up so I will just address your questions based on what I remember.
---
You always meet random people while questing. That is unavoidable and you will group up with a lot of randoms to complete all sorts of quests and things. You will likely see them in other zones later on if you remember their names, most people quest at their own pace but since some areas are so large (Barrens) you will likely meet up with people again. Sharing of items is kind of random, my experience is that 90% of the people understood to only greed items they couldn't directly use and need items that were an upgrade for them.
---
People made a lot of money off professions at the AH. I can't imagine classic would be any different.
---
People always talked to each other. On my PvP server it was a real community, although being Horde on a PvP server we were a bit outnumbered but that only made the community that much tighter, random world PvP would pop upif Alliance tried to do choke points on flight paths or cities/towns.
---
No!
---
When I play beta versions I get testing the game and pushing it's limits. But aside from that it is a giant waste. NOTHING matters. All the effort you put in this beta will be deleted in a couple of months. I am sure 90% of the ppl who got beta don't even care about bugs, they just play for fun... The whole thing just seems absurd. I got paid to play beta versions of games some time ago and I have to say it taught me to respect the devs a lot more,  but this is pure marketing nothing more.
---
I used to play on Earthen Ring EU, and was in Hydra/Magical Me, on horde side. Was a great server to play on, loved it.  I stopped playing after Cata was released and cant wait to get back to Classic once its released :D
---
running 2 accounts, will have 2 60s a month in :D
---
Having fun by the looks of it!
---
HoTS was one, though most people who played beta probably dont remember and the game has changed so much it probably doesnt matter at this point. Also world of warships was another
---
I mean in reality what this means is you are going to see dungeon "required levels" going down and some of the challenge will come back. In pservers we were wiping on van cleef with a full group of 20s. I remember groups of level 18s helping a lv 17 through Deadmines back in the day and having a tough time, but clearing it all.
---
I agree with this, I think you are spot on
---
Everything you're supposed to be doing
---
Vanilla was hostile even when it was current. People would get upset if you picked a talent that wasn’t confirmed to be the good one.
---
I’m the opposite I’m already bored of classic wow even tho it isn’t out yet
---
Community is still amazing even after reaching lvl 30 cap - I could argue it’s better than before- at cap.  We are all pushing to do content outside our lvl range - Stv quests to get hunters the big game hunters bow/gun, warrior ww axe, pushing SM armory / cath and sharing blue boe drops amongst the guild.  Honestly there’s so much to do and stuff we haven’t even thought up yet to do.
---
Just being around to mentor and help folks out with low level elite quests &amp; dungeon runs or helping to farm silks for our guild tailors to make bags for everyone.
---
Yes there are some 10 days offline folks like 10ish ( none are max level ).. but out of 820 member roster ... I’d say it a good ratio.
---
People can be your equal in ilvl and still play like they have 40 ilvl less..
---
I have a couple buddies that I’ll play with and I expect to play more than them.
---
I’m basically going to level two characters at a time and try to keep them both close to the buddies.
---
Main is going to be a priest and will be the focus. Want to keep the priest at a level where it is reasonable to run instances with them.
---
Main-2 will likely be a rogue for stealth shenanigans.
---
To be fair, if theres one thing a 14 year old is willing to put effort into, its writing an ode to porn.
---
In world PvP hunters can easily beat everything except rogues and druids.
---
1v1-Duels are a bit silly for hunters as they take away one of their biggest advantages: Their kiting and staying out of range. Without being able to do this, matchups that are easy in world-pvp become much harder and you can suddenly lose to classes you otherwise wouldn't lose to. But I wouldn't consider duels real pvp anyways.
---
Hunters are extremely usefull in BGs. Their ability to drain mana from healers is extremely useful. You can also use your pet to prevent people from capturing flags at AB without even being in range yourself.
---
If you are looking for the class that scales best with gear, I'd say  warlocks are your best bet at becoming the strongest pvp-class compared to everything else. Their dots take full advantage of spell-power despite 2 of them being instant-casts. So especially in group vs. group scenarios they can deal tons of damage to everyone without having to expose themselves to counter-fire for much longer than a gcd.
---
Right in the Feels!
---
Fair, but it's not like he's encouraging discussion either.
---
I highly doubt you played in 2004 or even 2005 you were like 3 or 4 years old, your vanilla experience consists of the multiple broken private servers.
---
you can even tell by just what skills and items you're mentioning. everyone wants to say they got og wow experience lmao its okay to be 18 and learning what it feels like to play a real mmo soon, everyone will love it :) you're gonna reroll off of warlock so fast watch hahahah meanwhile I'll cruise control my way to 60 while melting everyone on my hunter. hope you enjoy classic too my dude maybe you'll find the main you want eventually.
---
I got BFA beta while being unsubscribed. Don't know if it works like that for Classic.
---
i think druid off tanks are perfectly viable , id love a feral druid that can off tank if a tank is a no show or we want more than 2 tanks on something. that is if they are a good player , i dont give a shit if feral is not the best dps
---
personally i think the mt should be a war
---
i def saw bears tank high end content in vanilla and no one complained back then. 
---
its only become an issue at some point since vanilla, i think people always prefered warriors.
---
Yelling at noobs in VC is my jam baby.
---
So all the godlike hunters on stream are playing at a disability? Just curious, I was planning to try out a Hunter tonight.
---
Thanks for helping me choose, man
---
All of these people saying enhancement has no spot in the raid are straight up wrong. Bad DPS? Yes, compared to the primary dps classes. However, most guilds are still going to bring at least 1-2 enhancement shaman hybrids (0/30/21 - just an example) depending on how many melee are in the group for improved totems. You will still be spot healing for the most part, but honestly this just makes it more engaging IMO.
---
No one is ever going to expect you to top DPS or be anywhere near the mages/warriors/warlocks/rogues but you will still be greatly valued for the utility you bring.
---
No shaman spec is mediocre in PvP, either. They simply bring too much utility to the table with shocks, tremor, grounding, and the various cleansing totems (just to name a few things) to ever be considered mediocre - at least in my opinion. 
---
Windfury still smokes people in 1.12 when it decides to proc, and there's much more to playing a shaman than just "standing around waiting for a proc," lol.
---
WoW classic difficulty was never in the content.  90% is tank and spank.  The issue was A) gearing.  The mechanics were not hard, but you needed gear because healers did run out of mana back then regardless of how good their gear was.  Therefore, dps needed to kill and tanks needed to be able to stay alive.  There was also the issue with resistance.
---
And really B) keep a group together.  WoW raids were 40 man... that's a lot of men.  People leave the guild or don't show up to the scheduled time.  Raids were also LONG.  There were no easy versions of the raids.  For any raid night, you had to commit 3 hours minimum.
---
I spent most of my time in vanilla as a gnome mage sitting in the yeti cave near kharonos (?) chatting shit with mates, i'm just really looking forward to 'doing it right' and seeing the world to it's maximum
---
Oh boy, this thread.

Pick what u want based on Appearance ... This min/max shit isn't Classic, and everyone supposedly wants the "authentic" experience, well, almost everyone picked a race based on aesthetic.

This post  is NEW and EXCITING !
---
Play an Orc Warlock and get best of both worlds
---
Because you can get armor cap with pre raid bis and not lose any threat whatsoever. Thus giving your dps the possibility to go all out from the start, shortening the boss fight time, thus shortening the incoming dmg and strain on the healer.
---
No level increase, bring all the content you want to classic. NO level increase.
---
My dude, thank you so much. I was looking to go caster on classic since I can't stand healing anymore (played holypal until sunwell, mained warrior after), and Ret/prot was absolute trash in classic.

Yeah well leveling in classic is a big time investment. I only want one toon so i'd rather be in beta so I can see if I like how x class plays and i'd rather do it now than have to guess when picking in three months and hating it.
---
&gt;There is a reason private servers started buffing boss armor and damage by 20 to 50%
---
The reason is not because it was easy, but because pservers couldnt get a lot of mechanics to work, such as fire pulse in MC that made it so you dont need fire res gear on pservers. When they couldnt get a lot of mechanics to work, the game was reaaaalllly easy on pservers and they had to deal with this by buffing boss stats.
---
The streamers were invited by the marketing department. Everyone else was invited by the QA department. You have nothing to worry about. Games have been tested for YEARS before streamers were even a thing. No one is even looking for decent QA from streamers. Having a large audience doesn't make you an expert at finding and reproducing bugs (let alone the ability to write-up a good report). And, as we've already seen, having extensive experience on pservers actually hinders your ability to adequately test Classic.
---
I can guarantee you no one at Blizzard said, "Make sure you get Tipsout in the beta. He will have wonderful, insightful feedback and will catch many game-crashing bugs."
---
Why? Because here's what they really said, "Make sure you get Tipsout in beta because he will advertise our game to thousands of people for free. The thousands of other people in beta will actually test the game."
---
warlock for more variety in gameplay and purple swag
---
Lol
---
At least the title is different and not "Idea for what to do after naxx"
---
&gt; but then I remember back when I had a AQ/naxxgeared arms warrior in pvp..
---
Ok, now remember how it felt when you encountered a mage :p
---
When the original beta concluced I was super sad to lose my lvl30 hunter deleted with the beta data. I also would not have made another hunter.
---
I love leveling in classic but it is quite an investment. Not everyone is like me, but personally I prefer playing maxlevel a while before starting a new char (if at all). So leveling to max in beta to have beta end 2 weeks later and HAVING to level again, losing all progress you made on beta (imagine getting a staff of jordan or some crap while leveling... you're not gonna get that back on live and just wasted your drop luck [i know thats not how statistics work it's a joke you nerd]) can be really daunting to some players.
---
As much as I would love to hop on beta right now, ultimately most of us are better off waiting for release. Not to mention that beta is beta. How many times have we seen people whine about bugs on betas?
---
End game, for sure. First 30-40 levels we were all learning.
---
Seeing people complain about retail holding your hand and dumbing down the leveling process, who then turn around and are looking for the fastest and most efficient way to level through Classic is weird.
---
In addition to testing for bugs, I'm using my time in the beta to get a better understanding of leveling zones, the quests in them, and what's worth my time in terms of professions/dungeons/etc. I'm not really a "stop and smell the roses" kind of player, I'll be going for 60 asap after actual launch.
---
I’m looking to play an orc warrior, I’m just curious about Axes besides the two epic ones that would be close to BiS.
---
If you watch Preach's video on classic, that's basically where I was. Got into the beta and it's all I can think about now. Don't think I'm going to get burned out - I'm having more fun playing wow than I've had in years.
---
It also probably helps too that I'm not playing what I plan to play when the game actually launches.
---
tech
---
Yeah, I meant at 60 which isn’t really necessary either, but some people do it just because whatever
---
Highest you can get rank-wise is Rank 3 if you're still below level 33.
---
For many EU countries, tomorrow is a Christian holiday! Payed time off to play Vanilla all night HERE WE GO
---
I’m going to be playing casually when I have free time, so I was considering either a mage, lock or priest. Are there any major drawbacks to these classes for a casual player?
---
You can't be serious comparing atlas loot to the dungeon journal right? Dungeon journal LITERALLY TELLS YOU ALL OF THE ABILITIES AND PHASES OF A BOSS. If you want to look at the only comparison of similiar functionality of atlasloot to dungeon journal, it's what loot a boss drops. How is that harm, when the alternative is you alt tab and see the drops anyway lol.         
---
Gearscore sure, but people would be filtered out either way with or without item level or gearscore. It's the nature of MMOs or when you're trying to do relevant content.       
---
The entire game isn't designed around every player having DBM, For raids Mythic is def is, heroic not as much, normal and LFR obviously isn't since that's just a "lets see the content". If anything imo DBM has brought more interesting boss fights and mechanics that wouldn't happen without it.            
---
Questhelper built in isn't really a game ruiner though..?         
---
The castbar thing sure, but that's a cancer to not have if you're fighting someone 30 yrds away with say a noggenfogger to make them small to try figure out animations lets say.          
---
       
---
I find it funny to blame everything thats wrong with the game on addons, because it's really not true. Did addons introduce flying, a instant port to dungeon, 4 difficulties per raid, LFR, things like WF/TF, RNG sockets, PERSONAL LOOT EVERYWHERE. I'm sure I'm missing some big things, like braindead content such as warfronts/islands/farming wq's/farming azerite.        
---
Addons really haven't caused retail to become the shithole that it is now
---
There’s the 15 year anniversary collector’s box set. I per-ordered it, so I can pretend it’s my WoW Classic CE. :-D
---
You can check the Blizzard online shop to see if it goes back in stock.
---
Too bad he's playing alliance
---
My bad, didnt know this was such an exhausted subject. I'll just delete the thread
---
Well sometimes you start a dungeon and you have ALL the ammo, but it’s brd so you are going meele by the time you get to emperor ...
---
my brother leveled a warrior on my account. He had skinning and alchemy and somehow missed his defensive stance quest and finally got defensive stance at lvl 40!
---
&gt;Isn't the hunter mostly auto-attacking
---
&gt;Forget pet damage for plenty of bosses in Classic btw
---
Wrong. Only a bad hunter would keep their pet always dismissed in raids out of fear of it pulling mobs. The pet is a lot of DPS, and a decent player will know how to control them so that they don't aggro mobs or do anything else stupid. Also the bad hunters dismiss their pets in raids because "they die to anything" but these players didn't realize you can level the pets resistances to insane heights, and its very cheap to respec pets. You're supposed to respec your pets resistances for each individual raid, obviously cap fire res for MC. It won't die that easily then.
---
&gt;I haven't done the math myself yet, but 15% raid wide spell damage &gt; damage of a single hunter = likely more total raid damage.
---
Unlikely. Good hunters are very high up on the DPS meters of raids.
---
Here is an example, a hunter reaching god DPS in BWL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfignNAHCYk
---
It's just something most guilds don't get to see because Hunter is hard to master to that level, but that doesn't make the class bad, just most of the players.
---
I mean, theoretically maybe. It would take ages. You would need a healthy group of people that are PVP focused and wait for weekly honor rank ups. As everyone ranks up in honor, they provide more per kill.
---
Eventually you'd reach a point where people could get HWL as lv30. As long as there aren't any level requirements to get to that point (I don't remember there being any).
---
Hahaha. Almost first row. Vesq. I have a screenshot of his in game wedding with Buttercup. Will see if I can find it.
---
That's why my plan is  to ask at the beginning of every dungeon with a new group if everyone knows their roles/what to do . 
---
Sure you are gonna run into trolls or people that just don't want to learn/whatever but that's going to be their reputation on the server.
---
People that are just new to the game and willing to learn are worth the time. 
---
Not to mention that this will help your reputation on the server as well.
---
Yeah, I could tell.
---
Only folk who dont need to breathe air to think drown in puddles.
---
Nope, the honor system hasn’t been released yet and won’t exist at launch either. That’s in a later phase.
---
I’m 30 lol. But cool deflection. You literally barely talked about any skills or items or anything and when you did it was all wrong. Thinking rogues are one shorting on release lol. You think everyone is getting free Twink gear and enchants to level up in?  Didn’t know what cc was available in the 20s and why fear is infinitely stronger in that level range. You didn’t even know what patch they were using for classic lol. Deflect and make shit up to make yourself sleep better. Should have known you would be hunter lol. Textbook hunter classic player. Cancer attitude, little game knowledge, Rolling on everything too I’m sure.
---
Good luck bro. My wife is a Legion baby and got into the stress test. So just activate the account and sign up for beta and hope.
---
incoming removal
---
Change my mind: Paladins were straight up broken and should be fixed for classic. Please Blizz just give them a taunt, and reduce the mana cost of retribution spells!
---
Definitely feel you. Even if I was able to play beta rn I'd rather wait to play with all my friends in August. 
---
But damn the hype is so damn real! Too bad they had to pull the ol Blizzard classic and get me extremely hyped about something...only to take forever for it to release. 
---
That said....End of August is going to be crazy and dope!
---
I don't really watch any streamers but at least he doesn't rage like so many other streamers when they die.
---
I feel like it's the opposite. The people I've talked to that actually played Vanilla (like myself) are easy going, don't really care, excited for the content no matter what happens. The ones who haven't played it are aggressive as fuck, toxic, shit on anyone who makes a suggestion because "NOCHANGEZ".
---
They want an authentic experience, yet are playing the OP classes, min maxing Racials, setting up graphs and charts to optimize play time, etc. That wasn't Vanilla, so that's already not authentic.
---
UBRS was far from easy. Wear that crown, king.
---
I specifically remember being in uldaman where a warrior who had a warlock main was shouting at the warlock in our group for choosing the wrong talent.
---
A lot of vanilla players were obsessed with the specific ways of doing things. Probably why everyone has the same talents at 60.
---
Here is the direct link: 
---
https://gear.blizzard.com/us/world-of-warcraft-15th-anniversary-collector-s-edition
---
Wow, that's a name I've not heard in a long while
---
Orcish Blood Fury is not a "flat" cooldown, it does scale with "base" attack power which includes STR and AGI bonuses from gear, but not flat +AP gear stats.
---
im gonna try to get into raids where people have really bad gear but are good at the game. That will make it more challenging/fun
---
For me doing the same thing multiple times within a short timespan becomes boring. 
---
For example while I will have fun levelling through the barrens the first time, each additional time will be worse.
---
No they are not. Easilly the worst racials for the class
---
Booo stop posting this crap
---
Exactly! Good luck!
---
I'm stuck between two options of which to play first.
---
Orc enhance shaman- with mining blacksmithing
---
Orc fury (or prot) warrior- with herbalism and alchemy
---
I will be playing on a PvP server, and focus alot on PvP when it releases. I was also thinking of taking the easier leveling route with shamans, then when they are max, buying stuff for my warrior to make leveling easier on it. I will also have a group of IRL friends so I won't have trouble getting into dungeons or raids as a shaman. I also don't mind filling that support role shamans fill. I just don't want to be forced to heal should we get into raid content.
---
lol, that's the gist of it
---
Once your twink is complete there should be little reason for you to be anywhere near mobs.
---
If you want a perspective from someone who is going to be pretty much brand new to WoW in august, i cant understand people who want classic to just stay exactly as it is now like a museum piece forever. Are you really that scared of blizzard fucking everything up if they decide to support the game with content updates? Is it impossible for them to not repeat past mistakes? I just imagine a world where classic is a massive success but after a year the playercount drops pretty heavily, but they decide to add BRAND NEW content to keep everyone interested and playing forever. Isn't that the best case scenario?
---
I started my wow experience end of TBC start of WoTLK and I almost always played a supporting role. My ever first character “stache” (I know lame) was a a shaman but he’s lost to the younger me’s forgetful brain, then their was my priest who for years I healed, and finally years later when I came back from a long break I tanked as a monk.
---
I want to play DPS this time around and as a mage but I’m concerned that mages will be over saturated, is it worth playing? Bonus question, does it truly matter if I play human or gnome?
---
Isn't level 4 when you get frostbolt?
---
I agree, I want to really enjoy classic but I have to budget my time to play. So as much as I’m here to help new ones, I can’t hold your hand throughout.
---
pretty sure the ranks also have a level requirement, so purely based off that, no.
---
Pservers were overtuned because they couldnt get a lot of boss mechanics to work at all, which made the game very easy as its harder for groups to deal with tough mechanics. The solution was to overtune dungeons to help get back that difficulty. The result is that early dungeons were a lot harder on pservers than in real vanilla, but endgame content was easier on pservers since everything mostly just came down to the numbers instead of groups having to learn actual mechanics. Loss of mechanics are also the reason that some raiding was easier in that a lot of players no longer needed fire res gear when AoE fire mechanics are gone.
---
IT IS LITERALLY NOT A JOYSTICK FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME
---
The percentage of players who downed one boss in Naxx is tiny. The percentage who downed KT is even smaller, but this sub and classic in general probably attracts people who were more dedicated to the game. I cleared 3 wings before server transferring to help my rl friend's guild.
---
Play whatever makes you happy. However, IF you are going to be serious in PvE raids then you are only making your life easier by going dwarf. Fear ward is nothing to scoff at, its really that good. Is it 100% needed? No of course not, because warriors should know how to stance dance. However placing that ward on your self or another healer could change the fight.
---
You can at least beat rogues in melee if you know what you're doing.  
---
They would try to stun lock me to death.  But I'll get a scatter shot off.  Then I go monkey, pop deterrence, and activate stone form.  Then I melt them in a flurry of Mongoose bites and counter attacks when they try and finish me off (which they are programmed to do).
---
Honestly it's the instance I'm looking forward to the most.
---
Oh it's the mana drain one? I thought it was when you said the name, but I looked it up in case and it only found this https://www.wowhead.com/spell=202797/viper-sting it says it's been added in patch 7.0 and switching wowhead to Classic mode goes to an error page that says ability not found. This made me think the mana drain one must have been called something else.
---
Guess the websites fucked right now or something. And yeah, the mana drain sting is ridiculously good.
---
You can farm elementals for heart of fire/heart of earth. They sell very consistently. That's how I made a lot of my money in private servers. Sometimes these areas are hotly contested though, so gathering professions are a good choice as well. 
---
You can also tank PUG's for gold if you are good enough,  which is a very lucrative business for some tanks.
---
Warriors are OK farmers they just can't do a lot of the high 50+ GPH farms that hunters, warlocks, and mages can do.
---
You feel betrayed because you gambled and lost?
---
Kind of silly
---
Debuffs, but yes 16 is the max in Classic
---
is there ever a reason to track off-hand attacks?
---
I remember the help I got when I first started. WoW was my first MMO. All of my friends were Everquest vets and had been playing WoW for months when I started. 
---
 I will be paying it forward.
---
There are 16 defbuff slots yes, none of which go to DoTs typically.
---
i think this is my favourite video of asmongolds 
---
both the fact it took her like 5p+ days played , she is so happy , the smoking to celebrate
---
i knew several mums who played vanilla that also had kids playing too , it was sort of crazy you dont see that with many games where a whole family is subbed to a mmo
---
My hunter is going back to a world where she never died in the Qiraji War, where her sister never turned to eldritch magic, where her love interest was never sacrificed to bring her back.
---
She goddamn deserves it.
---
Me too. It's fantastic.
---
Simple, they just edit the video and change his race to undead.

Currently in BFA I still have different experiences while playing DK, shaman, warrior, and durid. Which classes do you believe have become too similar?

My wife would say pet battles, transmog, achievements and unlimited debuff slots since she's playing an affliction lock. 😁

I believe it is possible, yes. Afaik, there is nothing saying that you have to be 60 to hit certain ranks
---
I didn’t gamble? I’ve been subbed to the game. Does that not quantify for something? Others may have gambled, but I feel like that was the intention led on by blizzard
---
I gave up on finding an interim game amd have devoted my spare time to learning programming. I figure that's more productive than playing a game I won't enjoy.
---
So the fuck what if it wasn't in vanilla. Its a non-game impacting thing related to personal eyecandy. It's not giving me an advantage of any sort.
---
No stop! Too much! My bfa brain can't handle it! :)
---
Would like to mess around with a Hunter in vanilla, only played rogue,paladin,lock.
---
ah so 16 dots not spells like corruption and such ?
---
ty
---
8 was increased to 16 during vanilla. Classic will use 16.
---
You'll absolutely also use Fnova and possibly CoC. If you mispull and need to run anyways, mana shield (ice barrier not available yet). 
---
Counterspell is absolutely required against some mobs (you don't have the burst or manapool to just damage through healing)
---
Blizzard if you wanna AoE farm
---
And then of course there is PvP, where Fbolt Rank1 and Blizzard (R1 to unstealth rogues at range, full rank for zergs) come in. Fireball to put a dot on a rogue as an opener after sheeping is also good. And Blink! And your Wand if you ever cannot cast. Arcane Explosion for melee rogue uncovers...
---
Fireblast always, for every spec. Even Scorch if you're low on mana or need a slightly quicker cast (still talking frost mage)
---
Yes raiding MC as frost was very one-dimensional. But classic wasn't all about raiding. This argument is as tiresome as all the other badly informed shit anti classic people are spouting.
---
It likely is, but it also looks like a result of how batching works. You have to stand up exactly as the player/NPC hits you. The result is a forced crit while the server believes you are standing.
---
Class balance in Vanilla would have been as great as it could have gotten, because people can say whatever they want, but so many classes or specs being simply unplayable is a stain on vanilla. In content where you're actually bringing 40 people to a raid to not have more diversity in raid comps is awful design.
---
How does it hurt?
---
&gt; I might find mining equally relaxing to herbalism anyway
---
Well, let's be honest, it's basically the same thing with different aesthetics, and the added bonus of smiting to level up
---
So do you just save these images and upload them as a custom emoji on the server?
---
100%. At no point in vanilla WoW patch history did they ever change Feign Death from putting you out of combat. It will put you out of combat and let you place traps or rez people at the same time in Classic.
---
However, in the Classic beta FD is bugged and sometimes fails to work at all.
---
If you loved support, why not take a hybrid healer and then you'll have options? If you're looking for a mage experience, shaman/druid caster DPS isn't great but the utility is legit for 5s and PvP can be fun
---
If you google it... you'll know instantly its not.
---
Agree 100%. About 4 months ago I was itching the classic/bc scratch on a private server and had just hit max level. The dev decides "lol im bored bye server" and killed it right there. I was so burnt out and gutted from not being able to enjoy the fruits of my labor of just hitting max level. I'm definitely fine with waiting it out.
---
That is correct. Vanilla started at 8, it was then increased to 16. Classic will allow 16.
---
Who the fuck are you then? The stormwind city guard? No, i don't need your help.

---
You can't re-release Vanilla from 1.1-1.12
---
Picking a single patch as the base and rolling the content out in phases to gate progression is the ideal option. Sprinkle in a few minor changes from patches and that's it. Doesn't matter what content released during what patch. Content progression is a gate, nothing more. Itemization may have changed during this period but Classic isn't about recreating Vanilla, it's about creating a museum people can visit.
---
As a game dev, this is the best design decision to make sure you ruffle as few feathers as possible and stick to what makes Vanilla, Vanilla - which has fuck all to do with an individual patch than it does the core ethos.
---
I will start XCOM 2 War of the Chosen tonight. Read a lot of good things about it.
---
I'm stuck between War, Rogue, and Lock. I would like to do raiding, pvp/world pvp and just enjoy playing, I played a little right at the end of Vanilla and played BC a bunch as a lock, had a great time, Im leaning either War for tanking and getting pvp gear or Rogue but I am just worried I won't get any raid spots.
---
Oh well thankyou for making the effort to post for me though friend. You are a true gentleman.
---
The old Lightbringer helm model looks so cool.
---
I’ve made my peace with it, although I personally dislike the idea that my subscription will be interpreted as supporting retail/Live (and literally will support it) when I will literally only be paying it to play Classic.
---
I wanted to go similarly like that, but at the same time I would feel somewhat burnt out focusing on two different toons like that. I guess in the earlier levels it wouldn't matter too much, but when you'd get higher, I bet it'd feel like a drag.
---
Nah there are level gates. iirc you can get past rank 3 after level 35(?) Not exactly sure what levels the gates are but you get it
---
Mages are over saturated but they are also the most highly desired DPS class, even in 5 mans. Shouldn't dissuade you at all IMO. 
---
Human vs. Gnome, yes. Humans get a 10% rep increase which can slash off hours or even days on a rep grind. They also have perception, but that doesn't matter too much since mages in general do fairly well against rogues.
---
Gnomes on the other hand get a snare removal which is very helpful against hunters, other mages, anyone with a slow or snare really. On top of that they get 5% increase to intellect which is your primary stat. 
---
I would personally always go gnome over human for Mage &amp; Warlock.
---
I think they are testing if its necessary with Layering. I am sure it has come up in discussions and I have to imagine its likely to be in at launch
---
Ya I totally get it, just kind of sucks. But games are going towards a digital only future
---
Sub is fine, i'm actualy surprised its included in the retail WOW costs tbh. 
---
But the day they include a ffing cash shop, like in retail, is the day i quit and go to private servers.
---
I always carry a few stacks of ammo just so i can give it to hunters that run out. Basic 45lvl ammo is so cheap, that it's not a biggie.
---
***Muti***\-language Manual
---
Lock is easiest for soloing, priest is easiest for grouping, mage is fairly gear reliant.
---
The part of Vanilla that really burns me out is pre-level 50. Its not that I think its poorly made or flawed, I've just played that portion of Vanilla content way too many times to really enjoy it. It's more of an obstacle standing between me and endgame, one that can be enjoyable but is overall a chore that must be accomplished.
---
I'm not trying to be negative or anything, just expressing why i personally dont really care that I'm not in a level 30 cap Beta.
---
this is what it looks like when an autistic 18 year olds get on reddit and to claim their 2017 "vanilla" private server experience is how it was in 2004. thinking warlocks were the god mode class in the mid 20s and early 30s lmao. have fun rerolling warlock when you get into your 20s loool.
---
Oh I can assure you I refuse to wear pants during said stress test
---
#nochanges... I mean pants
---
I thought Onyxia was the only raid being open at launch, and from there they’ll release a raid once every three weeks or so.
---
meh honestly if your grouping at lvl 30 i would find someone else as your exp gains are going to be minimal at that point. unless that lvl 30 is a tank or healer of course.
---
I mean.. takes a minimum of 3 months where you consistently have the highest amount of honour.. so theoretically you're short about a week.

If you want a perspective from someone who is going to be pretty much brand new to playing WoW in august, i cant understand people who want classic to just stay exactly as it is now like a museum piece forever. Are you really that scared of blizzard fucking everything up if they decide to support the game with content updates? Is it impossible for them to not repeat past mistakes? I just imagine a world where classic is a massive success but after a year the playercount drops pretty heavily, but they decide to add BRAND NEW content to keep everyone interested and playing forever. Isn't that the best case scenario? Why is the stagnant museum piece better?
---
The downside of this is the warrior gets all their gear and stops off tanking. Then all the rogues and enhancement shaman are left with no tanks because they already got theirs. 
---
I would generally say avoid any group that tries to secure drops, outside of MC pugs and bindings, or if it's strictly attunement runs.
---
Hell, my laptop doesn't even have an optical drive, and it's two years old.
---
Time to start looking for something else to collect. They usually release some type of figure for new Xpacs...
---
In Vanilla, TBC, and even most of Wrath, you could get to a point where you only log in for your raid lockout, but playing beyond that was for your own enjoyment.  This 'stopping point' is something that I miss in retail WoW since there are all these systems to try and incentivize you to keep playing one character.  
---
Yes, leveling takes a lot of time.  Yes, there are still grinds at 60.  But once you finish those grinds, you are done with them.  They won't become irrelevant once the next tier comes out and you have to grind *every character* to the new 'max', assuming there is one.
---
And "Lost but not forgotten" requiring you to basically wipe out the entire population of crocolisks 3 times over at least, in the river outsider org for that damn quest item :)
---
I was told hunters get wrecked by melee &amp; i might as well just run from them?
---
Use it to hide streamer posts AND people who defend streamer posts.
---
It wont, only because most people can't handle the slow pace that is classic wow. Everyone has been growing up in the run fast, pull all, aoe now mind set. So when they try that crap in classic and it fails everytime they are going to quit.
---
Plus I do not want people like that ruining classic for me so its better this way haha.
---
You dont need to tell me this^^ got pvp rank 10 in classic and AQ40 clear
---
I think only priest would have drawbacks if you’re a casual player, since it’s a pretty slow leveling class, and most of the time you’ll end up healing when you do dungeons/raids (not sure if you want to heal or not).
---
Mage and warlock are both fast levelers and good dps so it should be easy to get a spot in a dungeon or raid group. Warlock might be slightly better, since it’s better than mage if you’re solo (imo), and one of the reasons people seem to go mage is to farm stuff at higher levels, which you might not want to do if your only playing casually.
---
Are there still invites rolling out?
---
Great to hear. Aslong as they are in classic in any way shape or form i'm happy. They can even change them to the later phases or have them be permanent, just giving us more choises for mounts.
---
listen here you little shit...
---
I only got to I think....56 in vanilla before TBC released. till I think...level 10 or 12, I got excited every two levels because I could go buy the new vendor white armor set. I wore the defias set till probably level 40 almost, way beyond where it was still good. was 5-6 levels late on getting my normal mount because I was poor ALL the time. Definitely not the type of person you'd be bringing to any raids
---
Thanks.
---
“Hacker”
---
It’s okay, we’re all guilty of selling accounts.
---
I believe it actually is release in the beta right now for testing me but yeah you’re right about the phases.
---
People talking about how the “no changes” crowd is remembering it wrong are actually remembering it wrong.
---
Ask ww2 survivors about remembering 60+ year old stuff.
---
When 1.12 released many things changed and many patches and hotfixes are undocumented.
---
Adding to that blizzard dismissed the 1.12 source code and is actually manually adding snippets of old code to the legion source code. Did people even watch the blizzcon panel?
---
We are talking about the wrong things.
---
warlock and shadow priest have a good shot
---
I plan on playing without any kind of guides. I want to pick talents that I think will be cool/fun. If they’re not optimal, oh well. I’m a casual player looking for casual fun.
---
I already know mage since day one baby. Even to this day I find it the most fun class for my lil pea brain
---
Beta testing
---
99% sure you don't. You have to get the quest in Xroads to get the Org FP without actually running there.
---
Ah, you call people rookies while you were beaten by the final boss: your wife
---
Sadly everything is gone except the T3 pieces and some random TBC items that are equipped :(
---
Everything right.
---
Right..!
---
Well no shit mythic raiding looks challenging compared to vanilla 5 man's...
---
Well we don't currently KNOW that they will be a breeze.  They could have properly functioning mechanics or "quirks" about them pservers never got to utilize or implement correctly that makes them difficult.
---
We do know that dungeons prior to ~ZF will however be a breeze to high dps groups or WoW veterans who know what they're doing.
---
I honestly now can't wait to see how fast my group is going to be able to clear say RFK, RFD or SM with 3 warriors and 2 shamans.
---
This is true and it’ll build a more robust community. So all in all I guess it is a good thing
---
Whirlwind axe is your friend
---
Having trouble deciding between undead and troll mage. I plan on reaching rank 10 in PvP. But I am also going hardcore in PvE. Not sure which one is the best overall.
---
Lots of try hards will attempt to follow Joanas guide and than realize they are screwed going against other people who are doing the same thing. Unless you happen to pull ahead of everyone and stay that way, these people are screwed haha..
---
“That item is not ready yet!”
---
Hunter pets and voidwalker tanks make my ptsd trigger
---
Warrior is always fine
---
Swifty as warrior
---
I imagine it is a November/December release.
---
I missed that in your title.  MB
---
Would like to know as well. Going to play a huntrr i think.
---
I'm GMT so about 9pm which if we have the same fun as last stress test means I'm testing the log in servers again except for longer this time
---
wait wsg jumps are gone? that will pretty much ruin flag carrying and render druids completely useless in every aspect of the game.
---
Blizzard how stupid can you be lol.
---
They are terrible hunter IMHO
---
Showing up is the biggest thing for most guilds tbqh
---
Chill. Replace 'joystick' with 'thumbstick' and reread.
---
ty man
---
Really depends on the situation.. level bracket, how many cooldowns do you assume is up, access to pots etc. etc.
---
A lot of classes and specs directly counter other classes and specs. 
---
A BM hunter is rough for a frostmage to deal with before you have iceblock and cold snap, as you have no choice but to completely iceblock that pet duration. After that (provides the hunter sticks around) you can beat him fairly easily. But that's 10 mins CD vs. 3 mins CD. 
---
That's just one example. In general hunters are kings of PvP (or their pet is) till level 60. After that a lot of things open up depending on class matchup, professions, potions, gear, specs.. etc.
---
As of a few days ago, yes.
---
How gear dependent are Elemental Shaman? They sound fun in PvP but do I need to raid for gear to deal good damage? Is the PvP gear not optimal?
---
If Elemental Shaman needs raid gear, can someone suggest DPS specs that can strictly obtain their gear from PvP?
---
I bet you have legion.
---
They give them free to everyone when the next one comes out.
---
I didn’t say god mode class, I said you won’t lose many 1v1 world pvp situations except to hunter. You said they were a free kill which is laughable. Like I said im 30 and I played in 2004. If your penis is truly so small that you really have to keep repeating this I am 18 and played on a private server crap that’s fine I know the truth. Only one of us acts super young and it isn’t me. I’ve used facts and discussed actual abilities, class strengths and weaknesses and why certain classes are stronger at different portions of the game. You’ve simply said “rofl private server scrub, warlocks will get beat by rogue warrior get gud and re roll” if anything that sounds more like the private server “warrior, rogue, mage best classes everyone else sux” mentality lol. Enjoy classic I will too. But probably should work on your maturity if you want to use someone being young (sadly I’m not) as an insult. It makes you seem hypocritical and not very credible. And use actual game knowledge to make a point. Saying “this class sux and will get one shot” not only is wrong it makes people think you have no idea what you are actually talking about lol.
---
I suppose it's more on principal than the mount itself? We were told "no changes". Some like to say "it's trivial", but can't we just have more choises then instead of removing choice?
---
I will play classic either way but it's like i won't forgive myself if i don't try to voice my opinion on it. I'm sure noone would be mad if they were made permanent for example basicly removing any of the stress they say we will have leveling to buy them in time.
---
this is actually pretty big because if this is not a bug then it means prot paladin can be played later on, recent /sit meta on privates meant prots generate retarded amounts of aggro.
---
I can understand that. But I’d still do Ulduar because it was just so much fun.
---
she lit a cigarette bro
---
Right here's the thing. If you get the drop on a Rogue you can kite them till oblivion. If you can outrange/kite a warrior properly he has no chance. If you master your class you can take down anyone.
---
Hunters were bad cause of their range limits.  Couldn't attack the Warrior/Rogue at all if they were within 1-8 meters.  Only options were to wing clip, trap, and run.
---
I'm not sure but people wanted it so I added it. It might be some niche thing that fury warriors or rogues need.
---
I’d buy a whole year if they gave me beta access.  I plan to make this my main game for a very long time. I’ve been waiting years for another game to waste my life on
---
I would buy a years sub
---
Yes, I am retarded
---
Don't sell dwarves short...

What is this keyboard turning thing I read about on here a lot?  I mean in all games I play i make A and D strafe left and strafe right respectively.  But why is using WASD or the 4 arrow keys considered a bad and noobish thing?  All I used my keyboard for is for movement, push to talk in vent, and action modifiers like CTRL or Shift.  I guess i dont see why this is a disadvantage could someone explain?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Makes sense, thank you!
---
No, why would that even be considered a good idea? What if people want to BG at certain level brackets in pvp and are forced to be in the same groups as these twinks who have leveling turned off? Absolutely not. I truly dont know why we are trying to add features like this to a game that is being released like it was when it first debuted.
---
Unless you're in the guild,  and you get to tag along because you're the guild smithy-- hell, you could even be the nightfall caddie
---
To heal
---
You got further than me, and I played this game for years.
---
You don't have to play in any way. Play how you want.
---
For me that was re-rolling every week and screwing around doing nothing.
---
Honestly I believe that free to play caused some major problems on private servers.  Such as encouraging multi boxers, spammers, short sighted behaviors.
---
With a subscription jerks can't just make new accounts every time they get banned or shunned. Financial commitment will encourage long terms thinking as no one wants to squander an account they  invested $60+ in.
---
&gt;  this subreddit has been telling everyone that private servers are too easy for a year
---
No, people said that they were wrong, not necessarily easy. Didn't really matter though since toxic private server players were ready to go for your throat for even suggesting that private server weren't 100% accurate.
---
Negative. A GOOD hunter can generally win those melee fights. Shadow Priests, Paladins, and Warlocks will probably destroy you regardless though. A really good Frost mage will likely beat you as well(because they all like to play in your deadzone while they dunk on you, as non threatening as that seems). You have to have a good kiting game, and know when to keep a lead to stay in between your max range and any sort of gap-closing mechanism that the class may have. You have to be really keen on reading body language of your opponent. 
---
Hunters in general have a steep learning curve to be effective in pvp. You have quite a few good tools to help you keep distance and otherwise escape.
---
lock
---
Your footage is from fucking tbc. It is pointless to discuss it because you forgot the tons of small patches, hotfixes and infrastructure changes. 
---
You want us to take gospel as facts.
---
Just locks
---
Wauw, that sucks. Thanks for the info :)
---
Why does this fucking loser get a beta key? He /afk out of like 6 WSG's yesterday cause he is a gaping vagina of a player. I don't give a fuck if you get 5 or 500 views, if you're this big of a vagina, you should not have beta access.
---
It’s another aspect of classic that many people don’t appreciate. Many of the things that were added later in WOW as a convenience item were actually aspects that caused people to leave, whether they knew it or not. Having to make legit choices and live with those choices made the game feel rewarding and like it mattered.
---
Nothing will ever be 100% Vanilla. It will be a modern reenactment
---
Planning on playing an alliance mage when classic comes out. However, I’m having trouble deciding between playing a human or a gnome, I’m planning on going hardcore PvP. Any help would be great, thanks!
---
I did the daily emissary and the minimum of one m+10 each week on my alt and that was more than enough to keep it viable. The minimum neck lvl of this tier was 38 which was easily obtainable by the time it released.
---
No. Nobody knew that Sharding would be a thing and when we found out in the Blizzcon demo we pushed back against it. Nobody knew it was going to be a thing until the first time everyone got a chance to see and play it. There never was a "no sharding" proper server to begin with. That's where you are mistaken.
---
Blizzard's response was layering a continent. There is no phasing. Once in a layer you should be in a layer unless partied up with someone in a different layer. It's buggy, at the moment.
---
Try to keep up.
---
I'm sure people would pay to play the beta, but we shouldn't encourag cheap money grab tactics as well. I would hate to see the next wave only go to players with the credit cards ready when it was originally going to be available to a larger group of diverse players.
---
Tbh I was planning to do that anyway, well not for an year but 6 months at least since im 100% sure ill be playing classic for at least that long - might as well snatch the discount rates
---
Guys stop hitting yourselves for loving Classic, you're right to love it.
---
it takes me 20-25 mins to farm the bosses for rep on my level 110 paladin. everything just melts, but running around and looting for 'mog takes time.
---
When grinding rep for wsg turning in those win tokens gave exp so a lot of twinks turned them in right up until they were 99% to level 20. Once you're there a sneeze could level you up
---
It used to be limitless stacks, in vanilla they made that 5 stacks max.
---
Source on those allegations?
---
amazing new graphics!
---
Towellie sure has changed. I haven't seen or heard anything about him in a while. Back on justin.tv he was severely overweight, then he got his shit together and dropped a ton of it, that also seemed to inflate his ego to insane levels which is the last time I paid any attention to him. Now it looks like he's been putting a bit of it back on. Still a huge douche though.
---
I’m in exactly the same situation as you and this is pretty much what I’ll do. Or the other way around lol.
---
No dps class will be in super high demand, but I would say a warlock for summons and a bit of extra utility (hearthstones, raid buffs, soul stones, banish).
---
As someone who loved Shogun 2 Total War, can you compare and contrast the two?
---
(Hopefully sieges aren't as garbage.)
---
But I don’t understand resto druids, and then he’s just got to suck it up then, or just don’t play Druid.
---
Retail damage is really low if you played on a pserver where they re-tune stuff to make it challenging. I doubt retail will do this for their classic but im fine either way.
---
For example most mobs in molten core shouldnt go over 2500 raw damage
---
Orc, stun resist.
---
You will be one shotting warlocks so you dont need to worry about fears. Plus you have kicks.
---
I was 59 when TBC dropped, all my 60 friends were through the portal, so I just decided to try to walk through it to. It worked! I thought I cheated or something but was so excited to jump into BC. Turns out you only needed 58 but it was exhilarating.
---
No dots, none. All debuff slots will be reserved for non dot debuffs.
---
Listen to podcasts on my commutes for work which are about 45 minutes. Just finished up a series and was looking for something new! I’ll check it out.
---
It has a few exceptionally limited QoL changes, such as full looting and automatic mail item withdrawal.
---
No, meeting stones are not one of these changes. You need a Warlock.
---
How would Wrath work without phasing?
---
Gnome
---
A Free Action Poting isn't letting the Warrior get anywhere near the Hunter though... Ok, you can't be frozen or whatever for 30 seconds now. But your run speed is a minimum of 30% slower than a hunters, you will never catch him unless the hunter player is incredibly bad. He'll just begin the CC and kill after you've run out of Free Action Potions.
---
So then why are you so misinformed?
---
In like 6 years lol
---
It doesn't sound horrible.  I'm really into the heal and support mindset this time so doing the re buff just means I'm doing.my.job right.   I've never healed in my wow career.  Pally and druid are interesting me so much.
---
Unfortunately neither of them were streaming at the time
---
I've experienced spawns much faster than the default 5 minutes as early as the barrens so it's definitely working in the beta.
---
Lucky you
---
^^/s
---
No its going to be. It is more like private server, we cant get real vanilla since we start in the end patch of it.  
---
When we played vanilla 90% of it was with other talents than the 1.12.
---
I go engenering because that will always give the highest dps boost + is the best for PvP.
---
Tailering second for some bis gear pieces.
---
So for me ( Mage ) its the best option.
---
My mage and all of our ranged dps were required to carry 150 fire resist back in vanilla.
---
RL Level 35 checking in. Just in time to unlock the Arthritis and Beer Gut skills.
---
I have also learned how to spawn minions. No one told me they never despawn, and if you don't feed them on the regular, their happiness decreases faster than a new Hunter's pet.
---
*Your minion doesn't like that food.*
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
I mean I was like 13 years old when I was doing this so my memory isn’t the best but I remember just keeping my twinks in main cities and never was scared of them leveling up on accident 
---
I remember the day they started making PvP give experience and it ruined one of the most fun little niches of the game
---
I was a "launch" player and was a noob for sure the first few months.  (i waited in line launch day but couldn't play for almost 2 weeks due to needing a credit card to make an account).  I remember straight up hearthing in the the middle of WC run on my first toon because I dinged and wanted to train my cat form.
---
Unless you're implying that you can either have only skill or only knowledge, that's not what mutual exclusivity means. 
---
What I assume you mean is they are mutually **independent** factors, i.e. you can have one without affecting the other. You could have all the knowledge but that won't make you directly better at actually playing the game.
---
If you see the melee first, they can only get close to you if you let them.
---
If they get the jump on you first it's a different story.
---
But there's still scatter-shot+feign-death+ice-trap.
---
I did exactly that and got into beta in the third wave. (i think it Was the 4th day)  if you want to play anyway i would go ahead.
---
That's really wholesome. Thanks for that :)
---
Honestly, I think warstomp for shaman is better.
---
Shaman lack a hard CC, plenty of soft cc in the form of frostbrand wepaon, earthbind and, of course, FROSTSHOCK. 
---
But shaman have zero hard cc in the form of stuns or fears or charms. So even having that 1 stun on a 2 min cooldown, in my opinion, trumps the 25% stun resist.
---
Plus, nothing is more infuriating when you don't resist a stun as an orc.
---
I raided as a lock from the beginning of Vanilla up to MoP, but I don't see me doing that for Classic, unless I go Undead just for the change. I'd like to play a druid, even tho you have the horrid hybrid tax, and the gear reqs for dual (tank/Heal) roles, but I loved my Druid alt in TBC for doing 5 mans as tank. 
---
I guess I have to make up my mind if I want to actually raid on a regular schedule, find a decent guild for grumpy older people, and play something that I enjoy doing every day. (altho farming on an Afflock was easy as hell)
---
I still think it's DM
---
It's gonna be classic. Latest patch, progressive itemization and bug fixes
---
Broodwar, WC3, MSN messenger and Limewire.
---
Those were the days.
---
Jeezz... rly dude?
---
So assuming you can powerlevel like a pro with maximum efficiency, how long will it take in days /played?
---
I mean if you do this, good for you. But I'd like to get beta so I could try more classes get to level 30, report bugs. Like of course I wouldn't play it hardcore, I'm keeping it for the actual release. However I don't see any problem with trying few different things you can do in level 30 because I doubt you'd try that as level 30 when Classic releases.
---
Not sure I would consider that a money grab since all it does is lock you into actually having a sub for the game. It would probably make sense on Blizzard’s end and not in anyway be a detriment to the game or community.
---
Rogues.  IMO, a good rogue back then that spec to have cold blood and prep should never lose a duel barring a nasty string of crits.
---
But my preferred dueling class in vanilla was actually a Undead Holy Priest.  Healing classes were actually strong duelist in vanilla because they could actually kill people 1v1.  I remember after a while in my AQ40 gear only ever losing consistently to super geared warriors.
---
That is definitely an option as well! The reason I though the route I had suggested would be good was because there is a ton of good content (especially the raids) in the content they have released after classic, however they have made many bad game decisions that people disagree with. 
---
If they go the alternate content route like OSRS did, it wouldnt bother me at all. 
---
I do think they'll continue to BC and wrath at the very least though, because its basically free money for them since they already have the content made.
---
Who cares how mechanically difficult the content is in a game nobody wants to play.
---
gcd? You could macro it in vanilla too.
---
FD and trap works exactly the same way in vanilla/Classic than on private servers. Hunters are constantly using that macro in Classic as we speak, just look at Themechanic or Zeroed for example.
---
&gt; But why is using WASD or the 4 arrow keys considered a bad and noobish thing?
---
It's slower than mouse turning by an order of magnitude. It's non-optimal. Especially in PVP, it'll get you rekt.
---
Its the best. But how much more dps % wize I don't know. Its worth more in Aoe fights than ST fights that I know.
---
Also enough people with engenering could global an entire group op adds during some fights.

You're doing it again.
---
If someone gets the jump on someone fighting a mob and still loses...while in BIS gear...yeah it gets hard to imagine that person being good at arena. That doesn't seem like such a controversial position, but I'm not a follower of his. So I don't really no HOW good he is at arena.  
---
I mean he clearly is good at arena according to everyone it's just weird to think about after experiencing a few of his ambushes go poorly.
---
Ahnk is 1 hour or 40 minutes with talents.
---
I just saw him in WSG on beta. His classic skills are very rusty.
---
Pretty much he was complaining about how this subreddit has become just us reacting to what streamers do
---
Wow my gameplay was so intense and skill based until I added a weapon swing timer. Now I play the game with my feet.
---
That's been very true of my dedicated raiding years experience.  However my job now requires a lot of flexibility so I'm going to have to he careful about an attempted scheduled raid night.  I'm seeing ALOT of pugs in my future :(
---
I got my wild heart vest on a 15 man UBRS run that I basically healed the entire group by myself on. It was absolutely fucking mental and by the time Drak dropped the chest and I was the only Druid in the group and I was upgrading from some garbage equipment, after I won the roll, I slapped my hands together in excitement so hard that they stung for like 10 minutes.
---
Tell me retail gear has ever made you feel like that.
---
No mention of druids? :(
---
FD + Trap works exactly the same way in vanilla and Classic than on private servers though, OP is wrong.
---
My only issue is that if I don’t get in, 3 months would be a waste as I have no intention of playing retail.
---
Hunter: was my first ever toon and I loved every second of it.
---
Warlock: I used to see these guys and wanna reroll every time. They’re just more badass mages imo.
---
Druid: always loved the class fantasy, Nelfs are awesome, just never really healed before and apparently all other specs are useless for raiding :/
---
Still, these three have me torn. Any input would be much appreciated!
---
Dumb question - in vanilla, were all paladins in raiding relegated to Holy healing ?
---
It's always been like that. You didn't need TBC to keep playing either.
---
I can’t hate on Soda. He seems too aware of how good he has it, and genuinely just wants to work hard and put on a good show. Sure, he gets streamer benefits, but that makes it funnier to watch. I watch people like him to see what you can accomplish at the upper levels of dedication/time investment, and if people want to help him along a bit to do it, I don’t really mind.
---
But sure, I imagine he can get a bit entitled sometimes. I think he’s overall decent enough to make up for it.
---
It's looking to be more like "Vanilla with sprinkles"
---
A true Vanilla experience isn't possible, but things are shaping up to be pretty decent.
---
Just don’t play them if they suck.
---
Out of these three, warlocks have the least drawbacks. Not many people will play a warlock, so you'll get into raids easily, they level as fast as hunters almost, and they're hard ass to kill
---
well they are refering to over-geared vs. trash gear. there is a big difference.  If you are over geared for a 5-man, you can tank in beserker stance with a 2-h and windfurry totem in pvp spec. yeah your essentially soloing the instance at that point but hey, you need crusader enchants.
---
I don’t think you get what classic release is about.
---
How does this have 557 upvotes?  
---
Everyone should know that difference between attacker level and  player/defender level is involved in the calculation of damage taken.  
---
This post completely ignores a vital part of an objective formula.
---
This video proves the opposite.
---
I found the "daily" quests extremely infuriating in cata. I don't wanna login every single day and do the same damn quests that every other person is doing at the same time.
---
You don't even know what that means.
---
I was both. Started off as a giant noob, played pretty consistently throughout the whole era, and ended up being pretty close to the ‘elite’ side. I always loved and played warlock, and warlock was total shit until the reworks. I only got to about level 30 until around patch 1.5 or so, then managed to get to 60. Felt like a huge accomplishment. 
---
I had 2 RL friends that played with me a ton so that helped a lot. We had a core group that could do instances with only picking up a couple people. Slowly go ourselves geared for MC. 
---
Somehow found ourselves in a guild that was progressing through MC, and eventually got into the raids and started proving ourselves. This also provided opportunity to start experimenting with new talent builds and see what worked better. I eventually landed on a solid build, and after I got a decent amount of MC gear I started topping the damage meters consistently. 
---
That got me noticed a lot more, and I eventually became an officer in the guild and earned a permanent spot on the ‘A’ raiding team. We worked our way through BWL when it came out, farmed ZG. Had tons of fun. 
---
When AQ came out we farmed AQ20 and slowly progressed through 40. Never got all the way though but still had a lot of fun. We were not really hardcore enough to make any progress in Naxx, but then again, there were only 2 or 3 guilds on the server that were, so that truly was rarified air. 
---
So, I was definitely a noob at the beginning, but I feel like I made it pretty far. I suspect that is a more common experience than a person being a total noob or a l33t raider the whole time.
---
I was thinking warrior or mage. Might just do both. Warrior will at least make leveling semi quicker. Hamstring kite!

these are memes, not games.
---
You didn't have to delete those characters. You had more slots, save for the two rogues for reason of faction swaps on same server.
---
Yeah, went trough most of them. I'm almost decided, then I remember cool things the other class does and I'm back at the beginning.
---
I'll probably roll a dice or something before Classic releases.
---
Feral isnt a meme spec, ill be going this for classic. However it requries a perfect rotation, consumables, and higher gear to compete with lets say a rogue of equal skill. Still viable though.
---
Stop it, you made me laugh on the ferry.
---
I don't get why people are salty about not being selected for the beta.  It's a beta test and they want to find a many problems with the game as possible before it's released.
---
I can nearly guarantee their reasoning to let streamers in was at least three-part. 1 - it's basically free advertising for them. What company doesn't want free advertising? 2 - streamers generally play more than the average sub. Bluzz wants the stuff tested in every way possible and many strangers dedicate *at least* 8 hours a day to playing. It's a full time job for several of them. And 3 - when a streamer plays, more than one person is testing the game. The streamers are showing themselves playing to 10s/100s/1000s of players. If something happens that the streamer is not aware of, someone watching might notice it and make a comment.
---
There is no doubt in my mind that Blizz would want a streamer over a regular sub to do beta testing. People shouldn't feel salty that the streamer got in and they didn't. They should be glad that Blizzard is taking their testing seriously enough to maximize their chances of finding bugs/defects.
---
I could run UBRS five times a day for a month, and only then would it start to get old.

That said, I also enjoy BRD full clears, so I may be a bit masochistic.

Definitely the lvl 30 not meaning much thing. I wasn't trying to insult the guy it's just weird hearing someone I regularly get jumped by talked about as some god tier pvper. Especially after experiencing a few of his ambushes go bad firsthand.
---
I am by no means a good pvper lol.
---
The expectation of no sharding comes from Blizzard's stated goal of trying to recreate Vanilla.  Sharding was not in Vanilla, and thus should not be expected to be in Classic.
---
Ion said at Blizzcon that there would be sharding.  Thats the first fail.  He said it would only be at launch.  Fine.
---
We pushed back, you're right.  And they gave us layering, which being worldwide and for months instead of days is actually much worse than Ion's original announcement about sharding.  
---
So we are trending in the wrong direction with it.
---
can someone say blizzcucked!
---
I’m trying to decide between paladin, rogue and warlock for my first character. Won’t have too much time to play so I wanna be sure that I pick a good class for my main. I also wanna get into raiding (molten core and black wing lair at the very least)
---
Paladin would be my first choice, but from what I’ve seen/heard it’s very slow/boring until you hit higher levels (50+) and get the appropriate gear. Also seems like it’s not viable for tank/dps in most cases? Warlock seems like the best choice all around (fun, viability), just isn’t my first choice. Never played rogue so idk what to expect with that.
---
They cannot main tank raids, dps is sub par, and they are the third best healer, but they are a lot of fun to level
---
They are respectable off-tanks and can even main tank a few raid fights but usually there’s enough warriors to fill an off-tank roll so nobody bothers with a tank spec druid. 
---
Feral dps is only competitive if you overbuff, power shift with wolf helm, and farm mcp (weapon with 3 charges). The rotation is complex for vanilla because it requires closely monitoring energy tick timers to power shift correctly. It’s a niche for people who don’t mind farming hours before every raid, and you’ll still be behind geared fury warriors, rogues, and mages.
---
&gt;!When you learn a skill you do it from repitition, repeating patterns, training reactions, (from a WoW PVP perspective learning counters and setups), so it's easy to be an unpracticed skilled individual. I play guitar professionally, ask me to play something out of my comfort zone (eg. an unfamiliar technique) and I'm going to fall flat on my ass unless I put in the hours to learn and practice it. What makes you a skillled individual is knowing the process and being able to do that, being comfortable in your environment, knowing how to succesfully apply yourself.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Hasn't Asmongold even said himself that he sucks at dueling in Classic? He's not only playing the game without full focus, but he also has flawed muscle memory and a very lacking overall knowledge of the Classic game.!&lt;
---
&gt;!We know Asmond is good at WoW though, because he has cleared high level raids, posted high dps parses, and has a solid history of PVP achievements, he knows how to apply himself when it matters. One doesn't have to be flawless or a rank 1 player to be considered good, if that were the case then almost the entirety of people criticising him should take a look in the mirror at themselves.!&lt;
---
To end on this : I don't dislike Asmongold, seen his face and vids plenty over the years but I'm not one of his "Army", I'm in my 30s and I don't play WoW anymore, I certainly don't sit around watching people stream it, but I might watch a video of it while I'm taking a dump. I follow the Classic WoW reddit because I want to play it, people keep talking about Asmongold, if his dislikers could just ignore him I wouldn't have to keep reading about him.
---
Calling him bad at the game doesn't discredit or hurt him (whether true or not), his strength is his personality, he's a paid entertainer, all you're doing is drawing attention to him and furthering his career by keeping him in the limelight.
---
no, put on a pink dress and be happy.
---
That's the risk i also had to take as i am Also Not playing retail. You gotta Do what you gotta Do, but moneywise i spent much more on worse things.
---
I think paladins should not be able to heal nor deal damage. Their sole purpose should be buffer and completely immune to all damage. That way they would further maximize their uptime on pornhub
---
thanks for the reminder, maybe I have some Ritalin anywhere xD
---
Tinfoil hate. Thats not swifty
---
Well, meet people like that and put them on ignore :) they won't last with an attitude like that past level 30. 
---
I'm a vanilla vet, played a bit on private servers too before they announced classic WoW. Never encountered elitist toxic behaviour. 
---
But if someone ninjas or takes a chest being rolled for, watch all hell unleash and a group tear apart.
---
I havent seen the sentiment of "private servers have it too easy". In fact I think most people, especially those who actually played on private servers, knew that the values were higher than they should be on private servers.
---
Probably the shaman class quest, running from 1 side of barrens to other, multiple times...
---
We're getting lots of data from beta players, it just dwindles at higher levels.
---
The only other report we've gotten about this was on Reddit, and we tried to troubleshoot but couldn't reach anything conclusive.
---
the general conciseness of these forums are that yes 10 out of 40 people were always afk, but they still want hybrid classes to just be limited to healing. 
---
I am curious about this "infamous developer". I didn't follow the lore or the development during classic. I was young and just listened to what the lead rogue told me to do.
---
You are absolutely mental. You cannot grasp this simple concept. You cannot grasp any concept. Have a block.
---
This is only true for horde rogues right? Since orcs have 25% stun resistance
---
Yeah a QOL for sure, but as a lock main I enjoy the value I have without it.
---
Do you have goldshire screenshot?
---
haha true!
---
I hope so. If not it will be a short visit for me.
---
There are 16 debuff slots on a given mob. Dots will take up a slot. Vanilla had a debuff prioritization system, so if a mob had all 16 debuff slots filled up and somebody cast a new debuff that was a higher priority than some existing debuffs, the existing one would get kicked off.
---
Dots were the lowest priority, which meant dots were constantly getting kicked off of bosses in favor of overall debuffs.
---
Why would you not have a right to complain? This is the most idiotic meme that keeps floating around. It's a 2 party system, there's not a whole lot of choice if you don't think either candidate is good or right for this country, why would you put your seal of approval on them?
---
I'd take more resolution and screen real estate if you're only playing WoW and cinematic games.  Try to get over 100fps with a 1440p if you can, but you can overclock most monitors anyway.
---
You can start the questline at level 28. Having a lv 60 help you out so you get less exp per mob will help aswell. You will complete the quest before level 29.
---
he was playing wc3 not too long ago and got mad at what someone said in chat (at the time, we didn't even know it was soda), then everyone in the game started getting spam whispered to do things to mess with soda, we just kicked him from the game instead. He wasn't playing with the team because he muted everyone for his stream, and he was inadvertently griefing the rest of us, so we kicked him lol
---
Oh yeah for sure it's just wild to hear about how good he is at arena after experiencing a few of his ambushes go awry firsthand.
---
Not trying to insult the dude
---
they had no access to strafe in any way 
---
forward back turn left turn right is the default binding
---
http://www.darklegacycomics.com/87
---
We wanted vanilla
---
We getting vanilla
---
Seems fine. Do you turn by holding the right mouse button and dragging?
---
Is there a lot of demand for Locks in raids? Also what would a lock do to make himself very useful/stand out in raids?
---
Subs isn't as bad as like a flat rate, but I don really like the idea of guaranteed beta being tied to a financial choice. Active subs already required.
---
It’ll be worse. Vanilla brings out the try hard nature inside. Min/max only approved specs allowed, you must wear this gear!
---
DW is better if you can get the weapons but you need a lot of 1 hand weapons for warriors/rogues.
---
For PVP with weapon spec
---
CoUM: 98 ap (25 damage), 5% chance to double attack, 200 HP
---
DEoI: +10 top end, 70AP (17.5 damage), 5.95% crit, 250 HP
---
Severance: 86AP (22.1 damage), 7% crit, 180 HP.
---
GM:  -1 top end, 52 AP (14.1 damage), 1% Crit, 410 HP, 5% swing or 5% crit
---
For PVP, i'd take DEoI.
---
For PVE 2h fury (horde only) I'd take Severance.
---
In our group getting 50-60 FR was pretty mandatory, especially for Rag. We'd not wear it throughout the entire raid, but during certain pulls the RL would call for Fire Res. Not full sets mind you, we'd get the FR trinket from engineering, maybe switch a couple of pieces to ease the strain on the healers.
---
IIRC 1 or 2 drake bosses in BWL also required some resistance gear.
---
This is from the perspective of a clothie DPS, the tanks had it rougher.
---
4.5-5.5 depending on class. Hunters will almost certainly break Joana's old record on launch - Joana himself is going for it and thinks he might get less than 4 days /played. Mages have a good shot at the world first too.
---
&gt;Won’t have too much time to play
---
&gt;I also wanna get into raiding
---
Huh?
---
Amazing work! Can someone kindly explain to me how i make these available on my discord for use?
---
When i was testing unarmed I couldn't get it to crit at level 5.  Could you run the test again and see without sitting if unarmed will crit?
---
Unsure about which faction my mage should be.
---
 I am pvp focused, so gnome or undead. I want to mostly world pvp and 1v1 PvP but I would like to clear most of the relevant content for gear. My goals are R12 mage set and some bwl pieces.
---
With low tallents becuase low level, frost is the best for leveling and pvp.
---
yeah man jumper cables is nothing bro. sapper charges is shit man.
---
I raided ZG and MC and a smidge of AQ20 in vanilla. I was a complete scrub though still weaving death coil into my rotation.
---
Wasn't until TBC I really came into my own as a raider. Played the shit out of that expac.
---
And thats why Blizzard killed it with BG leveling.
---
Ironically Classic WoW will be far less dead than BFA.
---
Pretty accurate representation if you started near the end of vanilla balance and itemization vice. 
---
They will roll content out in 6 phases which will add items added later to the pool of obtainables. 
---
So it's kinda a Frankenstein classic. Shorter time between new raid tiers released (suspected not confirmed), no balance changes as everything is in their final form. 
---
As for QoL, their menus are pretty nice with support for modern hardware and resolution, netcode makes the game smooth as butter too. None that makes the game easier. Sure you don't have to download a mail-addon, a raidframes-addon and you get the option to stop at next taxi-point when using flight points without having to relog like you did in vanilla.
---
That's about it
---
Remember me when you see a dozen of them on the AH for like 50s, okay?
---
1g vendor or whats inside the boxes?
---
Except it doesn't, the amount of physical damage taken is not affected by player level and it never has.
---
As far as the armor calculation goes ONLY attacker level and the player getting hit's armor amount matter. 
---
Player level does NOT matter in this calculation. 
---
When you mouse over your armor value on the character screen the % damage reduction goes down when you level up because now it shows you the % damage reduction you have against 1 level higher enemies as it always displays the % damage reduction you have against enemies your own level. That is probably making you think a lower level player should take more damage than a level 48 player but its simply not true. 
---
If they have the same amount of armor then the same creature is going to hit the same amount as long as there are no differences in buffs/debuffs.
---
Another thing that might make you think a lower level player should take more damage are crushing blows. But crushing blows can only occur when the mob is 4 levels higher than you and asmon is level 25 and arugal is 26 so the damage is expected to be the same and it is.
---
You reminded me of the PC issue. I forgot how often we disconnected, crashed, or otherwise. Nothing like your main tank going silent because his computer crashed.
---
Warlocks are your biggest counter in PvP, so I'd go with UD.
---
Because mitigation is HIGHLY overrated in Vanilla. Druids have more armor and more HP than Warriors from preraid and for the rest of the game. Warriors have defensive stance and Shield Block, and yes, they will get crushed and crit less. Doesnt matter though.
---
The math on Druid vs Warrior damage taken is something alone the lines of Druids taking 12% more damage over the course of a fight. This is offset by a higher health buffer which means you are not likely to get killed by unlucky burst damage. If this additional damage taken that has to be healed up becomes a problem for your guild then most likely the real issue is the DPS your raid deals that lead to slower kills (and more time spent healing)
---
What should be said is that Warriors wearing heavy mitigation will be taking a lot less damage than Warriors, but here's the thing. You never compare classes in a Vacuum. There's only a handful of fights where this level of mitigation is required, and they are all mostly fights where you only need 1 tank.
---
What a guild should be doing is to use 2 Warriors and 1 Druid as their tank core. For these mitigation heavy fights you will always use your best geared Warriors anyway, and the Druid can either tank some add, or just DPS or Heal.
---
Set trap, put up monkey, send pet at steelsnap, multi-shot.    
---
1 add gets trapped, the other swing at you while you+ pet kill snappy.  
---
FD to drop aggro back to pet, Drop 2nd trap, continue
---
This is posted at least once every other week. C'mon people.
---
&gt; I can't imagine him doing arena.
---
Yeah, pretty sure he won blizzcon with pure luck right
---
Nah - go and watch some streams. When people notice something they speak up. Others will notice what they said and it's repeated several times over and over until they are happy the streamer sees their comment.
---
Do some things get missed entirely? Sure. But when you have a streamer and, for example, 100 viewers then the odds of it getting noticed and reported are much greater than just one person playing.
---
&gt;the general conciseness of these forums are that yes 10 out of 40 people were always afk, but they still want hybrid classes to just be limited to healing. 
---
But the same people are totally fine with warriors being top tier in 2 roles.
---
Im not saying they should rebalance classes (although it wouldnt be a deal breaker to me),but i understand it. I would also feel bad if i rolled a warrior to tank and all of a sudden druids were the better tanks. I say let it stay as is till naxx. Its just the argument of hybrid that i dont understand because warrior is as much of a hybrid as a shaman
---
Are hunters still good mid-late game? (Only ever raided MC and Ony)
---
I don't think I agree with this at all. I  would be spending my time on routes and ensuring that I can close out the first 30 faster than most other players.
---
I dont think we should have pallys fixed
---
I mean they are not dogs, it would be cruel
---
I played druid-healer back then.
---
I almost never used any hots whatsoever in raiding.
---
It was all about downranking healing-touch and using the right rank to balance mana-efficiency against throughput.
---
The key to not being sniped by quicker healers was a healer-assignment. Everyone gets assigned their own targets and only heals other targets if their own targets are well.
---
This way overhealing and the amount of mana wasted was pretty rare.
---
Wait until AQ comes out and roll an ele sham alt, there monsters come AQ/naxx but weak before that.
---
It depends on the circumstances...
---
 \- Alt run with your guild? Bring em Rets
---
\- Outgeared content (like when you go MC only for the bindings since everyone has T2+)? Of course, you still have Windfury Totem!
---
\- RL buddy is the guild leader and they have only 35 people online? You probably won't get loot but here is your INV!
---
On the other hand, as a fresh level 60 paladin/Shaman/Druid looking for a guild to get into MC you won't have much luck if you are not specced into Healing tbh. 
---
Still there is more to Classic than raiding. A lot of speccs work well in PvP and blasting your way through AV can be a lot of fun (and AV exalted gives some sick rewards), like 30/0/21 Elemental Shamans are absolute bonkers in PvP.
---
Sorry, I should have specified. I meant without writing any custom Lua in WeakAuras.
---
And yeah, you're right, if you know what you're doing, you could create an entire custom UI within weak Auras.
---
Perhaps the fights short of aq40 are not difficult, but you need to clear the previous content over and over to gear well enough amongst 40 people to progress into the later content.
---
Gearing 40 people consistently is the real challenge of Classic. It is an organization game where you have to count on 39 other people to show up and be competent week after week. This is far harder than BFA's structure of "bring however many people you want and the content will adjust to you"
---
&gt; You'll have a very hard time getting any gear as Elemental
---
This is really only applicable in a raid environment. There's more to PvE than just endgame.
---
It's a different era, and a different audience. Those of us that experienced Vanilla from the beginning are a LOT older, ok....14 yrs or so, and were used to the frustration and (walking) un-fun stuff that Vanilla had.
---
I also feel that those in the community that don't have the patience required of a slower and more difficult MMO will disappear soonish. (too bad, we need newer players)
---
Lol this response makes the one you didn’t read all the more accurate. Have a good one bud.
---
It's not months. In his most recent interview you aren't watching, he said weeks. 
---
Also, they aren't looking to recreate the worst parts of the launch - as a business in 2019 you'd be suicidal if you'd let server queues or people not being able to do some basics on day 1 due to pop flooding is idiotic.
---
Also, also, Blizz knows that a large portion of those coming in the first weeks will leave. Layering will both help alleviate overpopulation in zones as well as normalize the population once the tourists leave and pops begin to fall.
---
Your solution would both cause high queues early on as hundreds flood every starter zone to kill the same 30 mobs and have the effect of leaving some servers dead after the tourists leave.
---
You obviously haven't thought this through. This is the best option, despite it's deviance from Vanilla.
---
We expect more players than Vanilla launch with fewer servers at launch. 
---
Do the math. If you want a healthy game after the first few weeks you'll hope they nail the bugs and layering will be virtually invisible.
---
Hi, /u/r3wts
---
You can get someone else to craft them for you, it's a one time thing.
---
Not at 60 tho. Racials would provide way more dps/utility
---
&gt;"Lets get this addon out on to a tray, *nice!*.
---
Save them up for the final week then cash it all out at once.
---
just me two cents on this topic but i think there's a lot of disingenuous statements being thrown around regarding 'i did all this content' in classic, especially considering the statistics blizzard mentioned in why they changed to a 25 man raid group for BC (only a very small % of our players are seeing all our new content we're spending so many man hours on).
---
also, another point OP made, on 'suboptimal specs', i hope people realize that playing a suboptimal spec vs an optimal one is such a SMALL amount of difference that, in the grand scheme of a 40 man raid, it is only going to matter if your entire raid is specced weirdly.
---
the only specs that will be 'unplayable' (at least in mc/bwl) are fire mage and destro lock (due to enemies being highly resistant to fire) .
---
in classic, there was this HUGE push that all hybrid characters -HAD- to be specced as a healer to raid. this was -partially- because of set bonuses on tier gear, partially because of an unwillingness to experiment back then, but MAINLY because of the class distribution inbalance. I remember seeing pi charts for my server showing class distribution and rogue was legit like 20%, hunter 15+, warrior 15+. there was never enough healers. nobody liked healing back then.
---
If you wanna be sarcastic I suggest one of two things:
---
1) say things that nobody would seriously say [we got lots of classic haters arguing just like you did there)
---
2) otherwise mark it with an /s
---
I know 2) is lame, but noboy here knows you so we cannot deduce from past experiences whether you're serious or not. We also cannot deduce from your tone of voice or gesticulation. So either say something so horribly out of line that it's clear you're not serious or mark it. Otherwise you're setting yourself up for this.
---
Well you're not exactly going to twink a lvl 30 in the 30-39 bracket, are you? And The big difference between X9 twinking and X0 meta is the spells and talets that open up, as well as figuring out the new bis gear. Also twinking is not comparably as widespread as being max level.
---
I would pay 60 dollars for beta access. 
---
I really want to test a few classes so that when it's time I know exactly what in doing. I'm still on the fence right now between warrior and shadow priest.
---
sure they can use healing touch but they are weaker at that than every other healer.
---
Minority of dungeons, most have 5 people limit.
---
Druids are very versatile but in world pvp high intellect is absolutely required over any damage. Once you are out of Mana you are dead and if you are out of Mana in caster form you can do no damage. they are arguably the most survivable and slippery in wpvp. If you die, you typically know you did something wrong.
---
Ive narrowed it down to shammy or priest 
---
but thats as far as I can get, I think ill need to try them to decide
---
That makes sense.  I always found it funny that a cape could be "mail cape" and you could wear it as a mage.
---
for the permanent one yes, for the single use one no. For this you just need i believe honoured with hydraxian. Could be easier but I can't remember it accurately.
---
False. t will not have progressive itemization. The patches will vome in phases but all items will be as they were in 1.12
---
Here's a bit of information on it: [https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1709927-the-man-who-nerfed-paladins-before-the-game-even-came-out](https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1709927-the-man-who-nerfed-paladins-before-the-game-even-came-out)
---
This was a problem across all Hybrids. You have 9 classes balanced mostly for PvE content. If you allowed Hybrids to be competitive in raids outside of healing suddenly you basically more than double the amount of things you need to balance.
---
It took them until TBC to be able to do this. 
---
Personally I don't want them to touch class balance. It was fine then and its fine now.
---
Forgive my ignorance, but just watching streams and stuff,  while there are bugs it doesn't seem like there are that many, why is the release date 3 months or so away?
---
It'll have to be. If the community treats it like a single player game with grouping options then it's doomed
---
So heres my theory on quests lile that. The thought is, do you give a player a quest to kill 30 zehvras? Or do you give them a quest to collect 4 hooves but require an average of 30 kills to get them? Personally I think the 4 hooves is better gameplay, because you could theoretically get them in 4 kills.. Or 40, so it makes it more interesting. I think thats one huge problem modern wow has, all of the quests require an exact amount and quest items are always 100% chance to drop. There's no wonder or difficulty to that its just a time sink.
---
Don't know, didn't heal as one, think it was the other way around, great healing from them
---
Anyone has a chance to beat anyone, if the latter "anyone" is AFK with 1% HP. Or are you assuming full HP, full CDs, full consumables, optimal engi trinkets and full skill?
---
It's still rock-paper-scissors.
---
Locks shouldn't have a hard time ever getting invited to a raid unless it has a bad rep
---
Updated models. Well, on most things. 
---
Some barber shop hair styles were better too, in my opinion the Dwarf Soldier/Guile from Street Fighter haircut, was awesome on Dwarves. The night elf male having the dwarf hairstyles too, that was cool.
---
I did stop liking the spiked ponytail on human males though. That's just a bit too over the top in my opinion. If you really had to, just keep it on Varian Wrynn and no one else.
---
Not retail, but from TBC, I miss classes being more viable.
---
But i still enjoy vanilla than other expansions other than TBC anyway.
---
Yeah but the issue here is that it's not a bug. The accept button works. They made it flash and that triggers Vanilla WoW purists. 
---
If you clicked the accept button when it was highlighted and it didn't work and only worked when it was not highlighted, that would be a bug and should be posted here.
---
Do whatever tickles your fancy (: sounds like no one can help with this as it's an aesthetic choice
---
You are wrong
---
ugh stop this is too real
---
***What can I do for you?***
---
you too bud, good luck rerolling off warlock and finding a new main. :)
---
PvP there top tier from start to finish. Pve you only need 2 per raid for AQ and naxx and yourll be the bottom of the meter.
---
I got keylogged once using a dodgey gathering add on by I'm assuming a would-be Chinese gold farmer.
---
I didn't log in for a couple of days and obviously couldn't when I got round to it, so had a look in my emails to see that someone had changed my password
---
What they hadn't bet on (for some unknown reason) was me recovering the account so I ended having a free month on the guy, cheers!
---
I just thought "ass-mangled" was a good one. :(
---
Since we've got a post open, does anyone know of an add-on that does auto looting, so I don't have to hit shift? Also, because shift plus a keybind doesn't auto loot pick pocket.
---
&gt; Except it doesn't, the amount of physical damage taken is not affected by player level and it never has.
---
DR% = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 * (AttackerLevel + 4.5 * (AttackerLevel - Player Level)))
---
Today you have been awared. 
---
No need to thank me.
---
The stun resist is excellent against any class that can stun tbh. Ret pala, SP, warr with mace spec and unstoppable force (not that such a thing exists), intimidation, elemental mage, even lock can stun with infernal
---
You can raid as a casual. You still need to watch YouTube videos to learn fights and you need to know your rotation but a lot of people do late raids so there are carries in the raid. So if guilds are on AQ he can raid MC with their alts and shit
---
We're already getting a few changes that weren't Vanilla, who's to say that after a few months people won't want the other fixes that were planned for Vanilla but pushed to BC?
---
Kids gonna kid. I’ll be fine on warlock thanks.
---
Grow up.
---
&gt; people see how much more time consuming, unrewarding and at times even punishing classic is 
---
This is exactly why I prefer it. In retail you are handed epics like candy and they mean NOTHING. 
---
I'd rather get 1 upgrade a month, but I'll know its name, and it will actually mean something to me.
---
One problem that’ll occur (and probably is occurring now on beta/pservers) is the prevalence of older players that quit expansions ago coming back.
---
There’s a ton of people that quit in because “tbc/wrath ruined the game.” These people didn’t grow and develop alongside the game. Their skill is most likely very similar (or lower) to what it was when they played over a decade ago. This itself will skew any anecdotal evidence we observe.
---
There’s also players that never played Vanilla now on beta/pservers. Since the game is fundamentally different, they are bound to make mistakes due to being unfamiliar to the unforgivingness of the game toward mistakes (like mob packs chain pulling because they endlessly, which is harder to recover from than in retail). He’ll even players that played back then will make these mistakes as they relearn.
---
But of the players that kept with the game, their skill has improved compared to Vanilla. The basics of those games are very different and retail is plainly more complex and mechanic. That’s undeniable. We are thusly trained to be better players just by the leveling and gearing experience of retail.
---
I remember flag room being fine for transforms just not mounts.
---
Well you wouldn't get beta, since they give it out to streamers that didnt even play the game or have an active sub. Rip beta
---
so i’ve decided to go lock for sure over mage. but now my question is gnome or human. 
---
gnomes are small and fun and probably hysterical in pvp. but you can’t see their gear for shit. 
---
on humans the gear really shines but they are just boring humans. 
---
i’m stuck.
---
The difference isnt that big tho and shadowmeld is pretty useful in PvP (again not as much as the alternatives but also makes up for it partially). Seriously NE is only slightly behind in PvP, it's not like e.g. NE vs dwarf priest where NE is way worse.
---
You can offtank and DPS as feral unless you're in a hard core guild
---
They said that private server numbers are way off for raid bosses, on private servers, all the bosses have normalized armor and resistances besides the ones that were immune. On Classic, bosses have way different armor values and resistances, I feel the average boss is going to be way tankier than on private servers.
---
I loved PvP-healing as resto in vanilla. Stealth, travel-form, bear-stun, feral-charge, roots... Maybe not the most throughput but extremely difficult to kill.
---
It would be my dream to play with such noobs.  As long as they are trying, it's fun teaching and playing with new players.  It's the ones that think they know best and blame others for their mistakes which are the worst.  New players that are willing to learn are the best.
---
Save it all, its needed for engineering... since every player will go for it...
---
I've never played WoW and am only going to sign up because they made a Classic server. I have zero problems paying a full subscription for just the old content. I prefer subscription models to f2p, and I feel like if they're doing this with such an old game- the game must be worth it
---
No Asmongold is a scourge.
---
Classic may be less alt friendly, but it's more fun to have alts. I had a BWL geared hunter and a rogue in blues and a few mc pieces in 06 and that was perfectly fine with me. Each character had their own gear progression to work towards and goals to meet. The only thing your making could do for your alt is support it with gold. Reputations didn't need to be grinded, tokens farmed or artifact power gained. It was all up to you what you wanted to do to progress that character and at what pace.
---
Joanna is gonna smoke us out of the water. He'll be level 9 by the time we accept the first quest :) I look forward to this event. Im guessing warriors are best for this event because of rage?
---
&gt; But crushing blows can only occur when the mob is 4 levels higher than you
---
Actually it's 3 levels.
---
Again , no need to thank me. This information is free.
---
Actually it makes a lot of sense to give beta access to people who never played wow. Like everyone on asmonds stream knows about classic wow and that its coming out etc and it obviously makes sense for him to have access. But on the other hand on a stream of lets say pokimane who k think mever played, there is gonna be a big chunk of people who never played it aswell and that maybe dont even know about it. Its a good way to make people interested that had 0 interest in the first place and possibly didnt even know about it.
---
I'll be maining a rogue/ alt mage, but just in  general I am having trouble deciding professions. Is there some sort of profession guide somewhere on this sub that can help me make that decision?
---
Just know your rotation and get your pre raid bis and someone will take you if you're nice to play with
---
DoT stands for "damage over time" - it's Corruption, Shadow Word: Pain, Serpent Sting, etc, as well as proc-DoTs like Ignite and Deep Wounds. Usually, only SWP and maaaybe 1 Corruption are allowed to be used. Other 14-15 *debuff* slots are for Faerie Fire, Curse of Elements, Curse of Shadow, Gift of Arthas, Sunder Armor, etc.
---
This isn't twitch chat kiddo
---
World bosses are my favorite part I think... being able to rep some world boss gear is on another level of dopamine highs.
---
The real meme is that this probably WAS intended by the devs for the most part. It just never really took off. Maybe not MCP stuff, but devs like Kevin Jordan have been quoted as saying things like SoR was intended to be the PvE seal for longer sustained fights where a fast weapon would outpace the slow burst of SoC.
---
If you can't decide, I'd really recommend druid as it can cover both playstyles.
---
but if the mechanic are so simple, they can do a billion dmg and it won't matter.
---
aka baron geddon bombs could do a bajillion DMG to people around me... I still have 10 second to move 10 feet away and completely nullify that mechanic.
---
This issue here is that it's not a bug. The trade button works. The accept button works.
---
This is not a thread of "point out the differences between Classic and Vanilla"
---
Me and a group of 3 friends cleared all the way to (close to) 60 doing dungeons as a 4 man group with a Shaman tank in Vanilla. If you know what you're doing and have good CC (we had a mage and hunter for poly/freezing trap/pet off-tank), this game is mad easy.
---
You can only really have one spriest in raid realistically. If you go priest get into a guild with this exception early. But if you go priest you WILL heal, even as shadow spec
---
Another certain (controversial) server that I play on, which is on Naxx patch, went from 900-1100~ peak in the last few months to 1900-2300~
---
The last week or two in particular have seen a crazy amount of noobs joining pservers. I’ve certainly seen a lot more LFG DM/SFK
---
IIRC it's much older than EQ, it comes from D&amp;D (the tabletop game, not the video game).
---
True, I assumed that OP wants a fast bank alt for the initial leveling phase to not run out of space and not waste any time running the alt to the city. Perhaps I assumed to much.
---
Initially, Ratchet would be fine for the bank space and mailbox and then later on you just run to Orgrimmar. That's at least what I will do to not run out of space while leveling from the start.
---
Priests can actually be almost as fast as hunters and locks if not just as fast. Spec into Wand Spec and spirit tap, spec shadow and get all +spirit and BiS wand... You should be able to constantly grind mobs with never resting with some adds if done right.
---
Our early patchwerk kills and progression was cast cancelling chain spam. There was some addon you could see what other healers were casting, and we'd be trying to stagger our heals to maximum effect and cancelling if the cast was unneeded. That was something our whole guild did, though I of course can't really speak outside of that but I feel like surely any healing team that got to naxx must have known about cast cancelling, and downranking would surely have been found out before T2 gear.
---
We have no idea. They haven’t said squat
---
@Astroid create a countdown link for people.
---
The beta, it's in it
---
And that's a good thing
---
Dude why are you taking this as some attack lol what the hell is wrong with you
---
I was going to be ashamed if there wasn’t a single RIP on here. RIP Verne.
---
You mean tank grp right? Warlocks will never be put in melee grp for blood pact.
---
You have one shaman for wf totem, one hunter for trueshot and 3 melee
---
so many liars in this poll.
---
Is this Asmon's/Esfand's MAGA guild?
---
I got hacked, and the hacker vendored all my items. Blizz was able to return the items on my character, but none of the ones in my bank.
---
You can join the Classic Priest Discord:  [https://discord.gg/MCvQGZ](https://discord.gg/MCvQGZ)
---
How does a taunt help them heal more lol
---
Or you forget. Then 3 days later you look at all those items and you quest log and refuse to destroy any because you can't remember which ones are still needed.
---
I had a 49 Troll Priest healer “twink”in Vanilla (mostly just well geared for that level. I stopped leveling him at 49 and did BGs exclusively for the PvP armor set). It was honestly one of the best times I had in WoW
---
40-49 was a good bracket because there were very few twinks since it took a while to get there. And a twink healer isn’t as obviously OP as a twink rogue or warrior since you’re not one shorting people instantly etc
---
Yes I do, I do not move with the mouse though, I use the W key.  I remember backpedaling a lot when the camera would get stuck and I could make my guy moonwalk.
---
I just dont understand it, i thought the dream for the old school wow players that hate retail would to bring back vanilla wow but also expand on it while keeping the philosophy of it intact. Not just bring it back and it stays like that forever while playerbase declines and declines. But i think most of these people would actually want more and more content but just dont trust Blizzard. I cant see anyone argue otherwise convincingly.
---
Do what you like. Hunter is so nice to play at any level or situation. If you do appreciate a challenge, warrior is still feels strong, but requires high effort. If you like tanking, I'd recommend warrior as the tanking aspects makes leveling and gearing less boring. Anything else I'd recommend Hunter
---
It's controversial because it's nonsensical to draw conclusions when you're basically playing a different game. 
---
Venruki in his prime, like all top arena players, played at a far higher level of competition than anyone ever did in Vanilla. 
---
Vanilla PvP was pretty comfortably the least skill based era of the game. In my opinion it was also the most fun, but I'm under no illusions over how many aspects of it are a crapshoot.
---
Are we talking about the end of classic or ragnaros?
---
I remember mounts, travel form and ghost wolf being under the same restrictions. I am almost certain that there was only an outdoor/indoor flag in regards to what could be used.
---
PSA: If you want to raid get your pre raid BiS, watch YouTube videos on the raid you're trying to do, and be a nice person to play with and you'll get to raid. You don't even need to be optimal spec, just avoid ret pally.
---
Luckily, Classic Coke is good, while Vanilla is garbage.
---
&gt;You can't be serious comparing atlas loot to the dungeon journal right? Dungeon journal LITERALLY TELLS YOU ALL OF THE ABILITIES AND PHASES OF A BOSS.
---
You are right about the boss mechanics, but I was thinking more of the dungeon maps, and how it might have influenced the way blizzard designed dungeons, which were always trash after Vanilla. You know every boss of every dungeon before in setting a foot inside, and yes it could be always be googled but it takes away from the journey.
---
Obviously atlas loot is the least offensive of all these addons, but it might have been an inspiration that is the shitshow that is dungeon journal.
---
&gt;Gearscore sure, but people would be filtered out either way with or without item level or gearscore. It's the nature of MMOs or when you're trying to do relevant content.
---
Yeah, they looked at stats
---
&gt;Questhelper built in isn't really a game ruiner though..?
---
I think so, and I was a thottbotter back in vanilla, but at least I tried to do the quests first and if it was some underground cave shit I googled it. And its kinda silly to ask for a "classic wow" only to have plenty of modern features added back in the game through addons.
---
And I don't believe questhelper addon was made before TBC either
---
&gt;The entire game isn't designed around every player having DBM, For raids Mythic is def is, heroic not as much, normal and LFR obviously isn't since that's just a "lets see the content". If anything imo DBM has brought more interesting boss fights and mechanics that wouldn't happen without it.
---
It absolutely is, and it limits the design of raid encounters since Blizzard has to assume that every fucking player in any raid has an indicator on the screen that literally tells them how to play any encounter, and thus everything is entirely reaction-based.
---
Sure, DBM is good on retail, and Blizzard has made really advanced encounters to compensate. But for vanilla, I think a modern DBM will completly gut the raids singlehandely.
---
&gt;The castbar thing sure, but that's a cancer to not have if you're fighting someone 30 yrds away with say a noggenfogger to make them small to try figure out animations lets say.
---
Yes, but you don't see the enemy buffs or castbars in vanilla, and the problem if you can see it with addons. So either I think they should either ban the addons or enable it for everyone, if they made added castbars I am fine with that more than not having it, and still having it enabled by addons.
---
&gt;Addons really haven't caused retail to become the shithole that it is now
---
Not entirely, but I definitely think some addons have had a bad influence on how the game is designed, like the ones I mentioned.
---
Arenas... Everything other is irelevant
---
&gt; The difference isnt that big tho and shadowmeld is pretty useful in PvP 
---
Not as a rogue. I mean, it's literally useless as a rogue
---
Great write up here:
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/#introduction
---
Unless you're implying that you can only have one or the other; skill or knowledge, that's not what mutual exclusivity means.
---
Having high skill implies that you have a high knowledge of the game, you've learnt to play the game at a competent level. Having high knowledge of the game however doesn't imply that you have high skill. Knowledge is independent of skill, skill is dependent on knowledge.
---
Basically everybody generates massive threat in Vanilla, except warriors, they must work for it :D

---
Primary Timezone: AUS GMT +10 (SYD/PERTH/SG) \*\*Guild Dungeon's\*\* from 7:30pm, **Raiding** @ 9pm-11:30pm. Quick raid's a good raid!

**Description:** We're a guild with a focus on the 'good' of playing WoW. We know a lot about Warcraft and while we care about doing really well (top 10%), we also don't want to freak about BiS gear, MOST viable spec or overdoing it.
---
You value positivity, friendliness and respect while believing respect also means *putting in the required effort* rather than expecting to be carried.
---
We’re all busy be it jobs, family or real life – it’s simply not realistic to expect an ‘always online’ mentality. Some months you'll be at raid every week, others you'll need to miss a few. You want to experience the smooth clearing of dungeons/raids that without overdoing the time commitments and not balancing life.
---
You want a guild that has flexibility for YOU. However, you believe your teammates deserve to have you turn up when you say you will.
---
**\*\*Ethos in General\*\*:** Turn up when you say you will, don’t be upset if you can’t participate in a certain dungeon/raid. Believe that people should get gear relative to how often they participate and focus on the guilds success before your own. Be excited about helping out guildies, the leveling journey and reliving the best MMO-RPG that ever was
---
If that sounds like you, or you want to know more about our Ethos - come join us as we countdown to the announcement of the release date (and then countdown to actual release)
---
I'm talking the initial talent tree before the rework.  And yes people warned me that going hunter is have a bad time and that any thing else would be better.
---
You don't know me.
---
Yea.. another thing to bear in mind is that the level of mobs changes a lot throughout the dungeon. Its reasonable for a bunch of level 20s to clear about half of SFK, but by the end it gets pretty tough.
---
I don't believe for a second that only 1% of the player base raided unless you're counting inactive accounts.   
---
I don't think that forum comment is claiming that. In fact, it sounds like more defensive BS from Blizz designers.   
---
Maybe 1% of the server was downing bosses in the latest dungeon, but a lot of players saw Molten Core
---
Doesn't sound like it matters a lot.
---
That’s how I played back then and that’s how I play now.
---
That's cause of all the asians. 
---
Not even joking, they massively prefer alliance. 70% of all alliance running around is Xiao-something
---
I'm still struggling in Heavensword.      
---
The problem with me is that I love the lvling in WoW but hate the end game. I love the End game inFFXIV but I hate the lvling.
---
If you want to reach rank 10 in pvp, you almost undoubtedly have to choose UD. WOTF. That is all.
---
Leveled 5x 60 in vanilla , main had 128 played days . Lvled 2x 60 on pserver . Im lvling my second character in beta atm and i will play the shit out on release.
---
Vanilla is never the same even if you do the same quest your experience while interacting with player is always different . Also the community in extremely nice and friendly in the beta atm , probably cause its mostly boomers and streamer ;)
---
I have it narrowed down to a Mage or Spriest.  My brother will be maining a warrior tank and I want something to compliment that play style while levelling together.  We will be causally raiding and doing BG's.  Any suggestions on what would pair better?
---
The fact that you’re pretending that’s not throwing shade is hilarious
---
haha you're gonna wish you were playing a different class come a week after launch :p 
---
its okay my child you'll see the light soon enough after you get farmed hardcore in tarren mill and stv lmao
---
Lol, look at both out last replies, and see who looks like having more sand in their vagina
---
I did, it failed miserably.
---
Toxic people have always existed, and due to their toxic behaviour, servers will quickly learn their names and will avoid them. This fact alone lowers the overall toxicity.  
---
Personally I'm looking forward to seeing "noobs" and helping them out.  It's nice seeing new players taking interest in Classic. :) Sure it can sometimes be frustrating if after a wipe someone can't find their way back to Wailing Caverns but come on just laugh it off and guide them.   
---
Since the game is focused around the community  people are more open to helping others and friendlier in general.
---
I assume Enrage works in the same way? Wonder if Blizz are going to block it.
---
i think some of the people going into depth on complete optimization of leveling speed are probably doing so because they know that, compared to 2005, they dont have as much time to play the game as they used to. at least that's the boat i'm in.
---
i'm still debating on whether or not im going to take some vacation days the day after release, or wait a week or two so that the starting zones arent as cluttered. regardless tho, in that vacation time, i want to get as much progress to 60 as possible because my typical day/day schedule would mean i'm going to be working on getting to cap for a looong time
---
Pathetic reaction, pathetic arguments, empty debate.  
---
You missed an occasion to shut up pal.
---
I'm a dev, I've been for a long time. I don't give two shits about how people say these words. If you were, neither would you.  
---
Even if you are a dev (which I highly doubt), your little speech made clear to everyone how clueless you are.  
---
Don't bother replying, this is not a dialogue.
---
Or anyone with engineering bombs.
---
Mailbox delay doesn’t have the same impact as talent/class rebalance
---
&gt;u could also do the ap  pom pyro pog yolo oneshot Specc.
---
made me laugh, thx
---
Sure you are buddy
---
Don't feel bad for posting it. It's just in this sub most of the people are super excited for classic and they (also me) read this sub at least 2-3 times a day, 7 days a week. And you see these "whats after naxx" posts everywhere. I honestly hope you ain't got 30 downvotes in the first hour. Just try to google it or look for posts made before next time :)
---
when in doubt, keep it.  An extra bank alt is easy to make, 10 minutes to run from starting zone to city bank. That's 16 (backpack) + 40 (base vault) + whatever you invest in cheap bags as extra slots.
---
Some of those are just preference while others were hard nos. Prot paladins are almost never taken for one huge reason and one smaller but big reason: no taunt and running out of Mana. You CAN do it, but your group must play around you, and that is hard to promise. 
---
Something like a feral druid is not optimal for tanking or do but it can be very decent st both, and the main reason there is they don't use Mana. Most specs lack dps because they run out of Mana too fast.
---
\&gt; Another thing that might make you think a lower level player should take more damage are crushing blows. But crushing blows can only occur when the mob is 4 levels higher than you  
---
Actually it's 3 levels at 60, better said as the difference of 15 defense skill level between attacker and defender.
---
I wouldn't say "intact" I loaded a couple of old characters when they had the free weekend a while ago. The items are there, but the stats have been gutted =/  Unless they never bothered to change t3 since you can't get it in WotLK+?
---
On big PvP Servers istjust lead to kazzak not getting killed at all :P
---
If you're low on time I wouldn't tank. You're expected to know a lot. 
---
You should play any of them though you'll get to raid MC and bwl if you get your pre raid BiS and aren't an asshole
---
If you want buffed Pallys wait for BC servers to be released. This is classic.
---
They're still good, but they don't scale as well with gear like most other dps classes.  You'll start to notice the difference in AQ/Naxx, but they're not bad by any stretch.  Plus, Tranq Shot is still needed in BWL, AQ40, and Naxx so Hunters will always be valued.
---
Hi, /u/Tracynmega
---
The only problem with gathering skills while leveling is that EVERYONE is planing the same thing. Since everyone will be starting at lvl 1 the market is going to be insanely over-saturated with leather and ore for a while so you won't be making a ton of gold to start. Blacksmithing if nothing else lets you craft your own gear and you can decide if anything is worth trying to craft based on the AH prices. Most people will just take gathering professions so you may have better luck buying cheap ore/bars and making some decent greens for a small profit.
---
Actually the crap that was in vanilla was much more powerful. 
---
A modern developer given the same API as vanilla wow had could write complete bots to auto play your character.
---
Remember when decursive just decursed everyone in the raid?
---
There were enough hooks like that mods could have automatically done everything for your character.
---
Blizzard Removed those as they got discovered, which is why although we have "better" addons today but they aren't as powerful as what could have been done in vanilla.
---
I was a noob for the first couple months playing vanilla.... after watching some good pvp videos I ditched clicking and kb turning, made some good macros and I really considered myself an at least above average player back then.
---
My focus was PvP tho.
---
Level 43 when TBC hit
---
I said something similar a week ago and got lectured on how he's a nice guy. I never said he was mean, some people just have faces that are extremely attractive to fists ;)
---
It's not! It's basically a totally different game dude it's just weird to imagine him being like a master at arena is all. You guys really are a sensitive bunch Jesus.
---
If I want to call someone bad I call them bad. I'm not the kind of person who implies insults I just say them. 
---
You taking it the worst possible way is on you not me.
---
Only firemaw, chromaggus, twin emperor's, ouro, viscidous, cthun and naxx are even tricky.
---
Then you ask them their /played and it knocks  your socks off.
---
I’ll always remember asking a pally with T3 and ashbringer his and it was a solid 181 days
---
Race is most important for pvp. For pve it is maybe a 3% dps difference while for pvp it allows removal or RESISTANCE (orc racial op) to cc. 
---
However the most important thing is that you like your character.
---
King's honor, friend
---
Can you verify if castsequence works since we've probably lost the /run version of cast sequence? I'm just trying to have a one button swap between detect mining and detect herbs like I did in vanilla.
---
Ouch ! Every time I think I was the biggest noob back then, I find someone that out-noobed me \^\^
---
Ya but it's not until like 10 levels later.
---
I know I started that Account at the start of Wotlk, that's how I know
---
How do I filter out posts complaining about streamers?
---
I don’t plan on getting burned out tyvm
---
So, how many people are in the beta? And how many streamers are there? Approximately.
---
&gt;Warriors are OK farmers
---
What If that warrior could have a priest follow him around?? any dungeons they would 2 man?
---
I felt the same way until I rolled on an "unofficial" vanilla server. 
---
&gt;getting to 60, getting gear, raiding, farming, whatever
---
The difference is that people are forced into groups for a lot of this. People talk, communicate, emote. It could be self-fulfilling in a way and part of the hype because people miss and crave this type of interaction. But if that manages to persist like it did in vanilla, then that's already enough of an improvement over retail to make it superior in my book.
---
For me, community is king in an MMO. Anything else is just icing.
---
Same as the crushing blows argument you made, you should do your research before spreading propaganda.
---
&gt; Hello, everyone. I've done some testing on the Armor calculations, and I'd like to share the results.
---
&gt; First off, let's look at what Armor does for the player. Armor is a stat that reduces the damage of incoming physical attacks from enemies. The exact amount of this damage reduction depends on a few things: the amount of Armor the player has equipped through gear, abilities, and talents, as well as the level of the player and the level of the attacking enemy. I found a formula available online for the physical damage reduction calculation for level 60 players here: http://wowwiki.wikia.com/Armor. However, after testing this formula as compared to the paper doll stats in the game client, I have come to conclude that the formula provided on this page is not correct. It appears that on Nostalrius Begins, the "59" in this formula is instead "60". That is:
---
&gt; **DamageReduction = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 * (AttackerLevel + 4.5 * (AttackerLevel - 60)))**
---
&gt; This matches the paper doll values at player level 60. The variable DamageReduction is a decimal number, such as .603, meaning of course 60.3% physical damage reduction. The Armor cap is widely reported to be 75% damage reduction (I have no confirmation of this, only old forum posts). Against a level 63 mob (i.e. a raid boss) this gives an Armor cap of 20708. However, given limited data about how the damage reduction scales with enemy level, it is still difficult to say for certain if this formula works for enemy level 63. Use at your own risk.
---
&gt; https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=17968
---
How dare you make me notice that!
---
Couldn't find a tank for RFC for a few hours but other than that no complaints feels like a smaller version of old community. Just hit 20 but already had multiple people stay longer questing to help me finish my drops or things like waiting for me to get the Ignition key before doing the shredder escort.
---
I was bored at work and read about the second stress test. I thought, oh maybe I was lucky and checked to see that I was :) I didn't do any crazy refreshing or restarting.
---
Alright fine, but if we disregard borderline bot scripts, then the modern DBM is way way better than the bigwigs 1.12.1 etc, or natur castbars or shitty x-perl (looks so fucking shit, but hey better raid frames) etc.
---
You literally have addons on retail that has a voice coded in when people use their CD's, and I don't want that fucking shit in vanilla.
---
In the base game there are no castbars, you can't even see enemy buffs unless you have a mage spell on them ( I think its mage), you can't see their HP levels or mana. But if that shit is going to be added in through addons then they might as well make it baseline in the game to make it fair for everyone.
---
I see what you did there... (T\_T)
---
49 puts you into the Mortal Strike bracket, so probably warriors over shaman.
---
YES
---
I was incredibly surprised to hear a negative reaction to a party invite pulling a diferent player than expected into a new layer. Doesn't that make it harder to abuse? Imagine if instead of trying to see Asmon fight Rag or whatever, he had been trying to get an invite to go harvest a Black Lotus.
---
BTW Josh I love the podcast, thanks for the constant flow of great content :)
---
Feral druids are soooo fun for dps and tanking, but my 2 cents: using consumables requires being out of form which honestly is a big deal to me since I love engineering and other fun items.
---
I'm not the one taking an innocuous comment as an attack. I'm asking what the hell is wrong with you, because you're taking this in an extremely oversensitive manner. You're extrapolating the worst possible conclusion for something pretty innocent. 
---
If I thought he was bad I'd say he was bad. I didn't intend to attack the guy's skill. It's just weird how different things are in the current beta. It's different enough that I can fight him pretty much on an even level. Because I've never seen his arena stuff it's hard to picture is all. That's not meant to be mean just an observation at how different things are in this context. 
---
And yet you people are treating it as if I called him bad or something - which I didn't.
---
Cheers for the reply man.  Now I'm even more jealous somehow hahah... congrats :) enjoy!
---
Anything. Literally play anything. Play a wombat for crying out loud. Just play. It’ll be WoWsome. We promise!
---
People gain site reputation by using the client and we do in fact have an option where if you get enough reputation, you get premium automatically. This way people that comment a lot or contribute in other ways can work towards premium too.
---
Well, you pay for the service they provide not the game, the game is free now. I am more than happy to payfor it.
---
There are still plenty of groups forming for dungeons but I do think that a lot of players are already nearly BiS. SM GY is still really popular, but Gnomer groups are less common. The rest of the dungeons are still fairly common.
---
I still think a lot of 30's are still playing a lot, but they aren't grouping up as much for dungeons but instead farming/lvling professions and queuing up for WSG/World PvP.
---
you can look at  https://willitclassic.com/ and try  **Gear Menu** idk. if it works for rings but try it.
---
It _used_ to be you had to constantly buy older expansions to keep up until they started merging older expansions into the base game around... Mists? Nowadays the sub fee alone 'gets' the whole game except the latest expansion. That's what I was getting at alongside answering his question.
---
These polls are for people that are heavily following classic, so I view that as being the main reason. Hunter attracts casual people. (High skill cap though)
---
I am having same debate female laugh is disgusting so can used it on dead horde but I am leaning towards male myself.
---
I don't understand the 'burnout' point everyone makes. If I'm going to get burned out after 3 months, so be it. That would be the case whether I play from now until release or from release until about december. 
---
So it's not about burning out 'quicker' but rather 'sooner'. Since I'm not in Beta, I started playing on a private server. Even if I'm burnt out, I'll play on release month just to play with friends. After that, if I've had my fill, I'll unsub. 
---
I just don't see what waiting nets me.
---
I would gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today
---
Spriest is awesome for group leveling if you intend to play as a healer at max level. That said, it’s slow.
---
For faster leveling, and with a pocket tank, go mage. You blow stuff up, he keeps it busy while you spam frostbolt/fireball. Also you get portals at 40. So... mage.
---
Just enjoy enhance leveling and learn to love elemental/resto at 60.
---
Haha nothing to thank me for. I'm sorry it surely wasn't my intention to make anyone jealous. But it's kinda cool that you are ;) Will let you know how it went.
---
Funny story that happened me to me this week playing in a private server (point stands):
---
I made a group for a dungeon (stockhades) and after I had 4 people in, the tank says "get a warlock so I can get summoned" (he was a human warrior so he had to have FP in SW).
---
I didn't have the 5th member yet, but my instant reply was:
---
"Everybody is making their way to the dungeon, why can't you?"
---
There was no previous conflict up to that point and my question was reasonable (at least I think so), he went on a rant about "why are you provoking me LOOL my hs is in darkshire, are you serious etc etc" to which I simply replied:
---
"Hey take it easy man I was just asking an honest question, I made the group, I'm running to the instance, I just expect others to do the same, no more, no less". He proceeded to insults and left the group.
---
Short answer:
---
Because the game overall is "harder" (plenty of elite group quests, a lot of time traveling, etc), everything you'll experience, community wise, is gonna be a lot more intense. This means you'll eventually meet people like the doosh I just described, but it also means you'll forge real relationships every now and then.
---
me too!
---
/drool
---
Those are 100% expired.
---
Its okay to get upset online everyone does it, I'd be upset too If I were rolling a class that was gonna get farmed in tarren mill, stv and its called vanilla and activision decided to rename it to classic for some autistic reason for anything to be a "classic" it has to be at least 20-25 years or older.
---
id rather not
---
&gt;doesn't seem like there are that many
---
Based on the community response on r/wow to every single bug in retail, I understand any known bugs making them hesitant.  If it releases and something like the epic mob damage ends up still bugged somewhere, you know the screams of "OMG WORLD OF BETAKRAFT" would be loud and shrill.
---
&gt;when you can craft the azure or shadowcloth set you already have better gear from questing and if you do dungeons to get the cloth you have better items from those.
---
What cloth gear from dungeons and quests at that level are better?
---
lol that formula was derived from testing nostalrius while everywhere you look for actual vanilla DR formulas you see that player level doesn't matter
---
Why do you assume people will be burnt out from the game at all?
---
For my priest, it definitely got to a point fairly quickly where killing mobs on my own was doable, but sometimes even pulling 2 that were a level or two higher could easily have got me killed. 
---
It’s often at those points you’ll also find someone else struggling and a quick question of ‘group?’ can then lead to hours of being partied together, having a laugh, and even challenging ourselves by pulling more mobs than we ought to. 
---
It’s been great even for a nobody like me.
---
can confirm, i was 14 when wow came out, but i'd played ffxi for a year or so, felt like i had a huge leg up on others that i was playing with at the beginning (concepts like pulling one mob out of a group, situational awaress of patrolling mobs, mob aggro, etc). though ffxi was much slower paced and wasn't very similar to wow, someone who's never played an mmo before will struggle with these concepts for a long while, usually.
---
Ah yes, "fix" a spec. But you can't just "fix" one or two, so now you have to "fix" the rest, I think there's 8 total. Now you've just got to make 8 entire new tier sets from scratch, for every tier, making every single other spec less likely to get their gear. But we could just add gear tokens! Have raid members be able to get gear for their offspec over other peoples' main specs! Increase the number of item drops to compensate, yeah! 
---
You starting to see why this idea is pants-on-head retarded, even after the #52,392nd time it's been suggested? You're just inventing a new game that never existed. Comparing the above to something trivial like a mailbox fix and claiming "but it's a new game already!" is not a valid argument.
---
This wasn't uncommon in Vanilla. We use to get 3-4 alts in a group with our friend's warlock or my holy paladin w/bosanc and shield spike and just pull the entire dungeon. I think our best 0-50 (when you had to stop running ZF.) was like 2 days /played? took another few to get to 60 since you had no weapon skills and shitty gear haha.
---
I still remember in TBC my new horde guildleader complaining about dammed alliance easy mode after seeing what paladins could do. 
---
Forcing tank changes with BOP in case of taunt resists was also fun. It also removed quite a few debuffs that made tank change necessary in the first place. 
---
Oh and wisdom was also much prefered to the shitty mana totems.
---
Yeah but. An in game calendar or clock? Is that really going to ruin peoples experiences?
---
Agreed. I'm relatively OK with people who didn't exactly play true Vanilla too much/played more Private servers but who do actively play the game now, some of them being pro players like Venruki, Ziqo or Pikaboo (I like all these guys too), so thats understandable as they can offer a unique perspective of a pro player playing the original version of the game, etc. What I don't really get are people like Pokimane, Destiny, etc. getting in who have never played WoW a day in their lives. I get that they're big streamers and that can help them gain more viewers, etc. but the main purpose of the beta IMO is to test the game to make sure its not busted on release. A brand new player might go into a dungeon, get 3 shot by a mob and want to report a bug that's not a bug, which helps no one. Yes Blizzard gets publicity but why not just give these guys some incentives to play when the game launches? Instead of taking beta spots from those who could actually help report bugs, etc. Plus these guys barely even play it because that's not what they generally stream (as playing offline for them does nothing for Blizzard in general). Same kind of goes with friends of streamers getting in, such as I saw on Shroud's stream his GF or w/e got in but she's never played WoW. I think that is the biggest problem people, myself included, have about not getting in. Not so much that I didn't get in, but that someone who's never played a day in their life got into a relatively limited closed beta.
---
Gnome is better for warlock in PvE and PvP.  If that helps you decide.
---
You forgot to account for sleep.
---
If it takes 5 days /played for people to reach 60, then I give them a 0% chance of clearing MC, unless they literally don't sleep and just die from exhaustion.
---
People would need to get at least 4 hours of sleep a night. so you're looking at ~28 hours of sleep in a week. ~24 if they go to sleep right as the next reset happens.
---
Warriors are the slowest levelers in the game FYI
---
Nah. Different classes have different strengths. I for one hate the current class homogenization in retail, where every single spec seems to be able to do everything. Classic didnt have that, and doesn't need it.
---
not me, ill be picking flowers and making potions!
---
I haven't had a ton of greens.  Maybe 7 total to level 20.
---
every single time you wanna use one? dude thats miserable just do engineering twice its not even hard just a money sink
---
HELL YES, I am so sick of all my alts XD
---
Oh, that's cold.
---
Plus there just won't be that much money on the market early game.
---
It takes a while for gold drops and vendoring items for gold to add up to people having money to spend on a new server.
---
Hi guys. I'm a noob. Gonna roll a Druid. I'll probably never have the time to raid. I like questing, world pvp, battlegrounds, and dungeons when I have the time. Anyone on pserver who would like to help me learn things?
---
Youre a pro or youre a noob. thats life.
---
Didn't Angelina Jolie make a movie about him?
---
The loot requires user uploads to get exact drop rates and sources and not many people are running some dungeons on the beta and uploading data. It's not like BFA where we can pull info from the Encounter Journal instantly for all bosses. We're looking into adding this manually (no drop rates) even though it will take a ton of time.
---
?
---
It's like people forgot the 1.0 talent trees even existed and that a lot of people hit 60 with those.
---
the only reason my old guild allowed dps warriors was because some boss fights required a good number of off tanks and they picked those spots when the time came. dps warriors always came in behind rogues and mages and those classes didn't take the main tanks loot so they were always preferred. Granted my guild was not super hardcore so it's possible i had never seen a real DPS warrior before.
---
My old guild had BWL on farm but could never manage to kill Instructor Razuvious before BC launched. No one was expected to know their best ability rotation and we never used consumables. The fact we could have BWL on farm with such a shit show really surprises me that we still wouldn't let any hybrid classes be anything but healer.
---
I like vanilla coke though :(
---
Hi, /u/kylealex1596
---
Ah, gotcha! Misunderstood what you were getting at.
---
I've barely played horde, I've never been a healer, and I've never played Priest. So I'm going to play a Holy Troll Priest.
---
I like this idea as well. Maybe you can uncheck having an in game clock. Or not use updated graphics. Stuff along those lines.
---
ok, give paladins a taunt - they're still dogshit and meme status for tanking.  TBC buffed prot in many other, more important, ways than simply adding a taunt
---
Oh man, I want that...
---
If I was a female troll I would totally ride his bike so yeah.
---
Unfortunately I'm a male gnome so I'll just steal it.
---
No word yet on what they will do. It's on the table though. When Tipsout went to Irvine to play test Classic before the beta, he did ask John Hight and Omar Gonzalez in an interview if future expansions would ever happen. They said maybe, it was up to the community to decide.
---
Those should work. At least the one I tested on the last stress test did.
---
/use [@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player] Lesser Heal(Rank 1)
---
As much as I am no change, I am all in on tuning dungeons and especially raids to make them a bit more challenging at release, that's how the game will last longer
---
That's a great resource, thanks!
---
Yeah I will probably just use this as a skinner and miner or herbalism just to farm with 
---
I plan on playing this game for a very long time haha
---
I can give you a long or a short answer. 
---
The short answer is really simple, a lot of players play(ed) classic private servers for years and years and they are fine without any updates because the eco system is working completely fine. That's what makes wow such a  masterpiece for it's time.
---
The long answer would be something like it's simply not working that easily. Just take PvP for an easy example, even Naxx gear is insanely strong against a fresh lvl 60, if you progress further into this route and make new gear stronger, this gap will increase and it will be even more frustrating to play against geared out people in PvP. Of course you will tell me thats part of the fun and I agree but just not in that extend.  
---
Let's say the "new fresh items" progress vertically .If you give a hybrid classes higher DPS... let's say the paladin has the same dps than a warrior. The min/max people will take almost only pallies because you have other benefits of having an pally than having a warri with the same dps. Just think about all buffs, decurses, bubbles and lay on hands which you have a lot more off. WoWs problem is that you need to balance between PvP and PvE both of them want to be taken seriously. A Ret pally may be shit in PvE for his lack of DPS but is a wrecking ball in PvP for these exact reasons. Thats why they implemented resilience in TBC, so they could balance PvE and PvP seperatly. But ask the playerbase what they think about resiliance :P
---
They're doing it like they did at original launch.
---
MC and Ony were available at launch.
---
They both have different tools and usage. Some bosses will probably still need a warrior or be much better with one, like 4H. I would say, though, that the mob damage being lower than in privates is a neutral change to druids. It makes it easier to bring one, but it also allows warriors to gear for more threat,  reducing the advantages that bears have.
---
Finally, please note that we still are not sure about boss damages. We can expect it to be lower on actual classic but nothing has been confirmed.
---
No, picked troll hunter because of bow specialization and orc warlock because of pet damage passive. After I've read the manual while game was updating.
---
They don’t expire!
---
Menu - Sound Options - Error Speech \*toggle off\*
---
The South Park episode for sure.
---
Well yeah I wouldnt want something like that in the game. Its a bery fine line in the point I was making. Im not saying like “there should be an addon for dual spec” or anything stupid like that. Just the little things that would make the experience slightly better.
---
Not really talking about that stuff.
---
Blacksmithing while leveling is great once you hit your 30's. The Green Iron chestpiece is cheap to make, pretty much best in slot until 40, and profitable to sell on the AH since the mats are cheap. There's some decent plate you can make in the 40's too, and Truesilver gear is in moderate demand early on. Sharpening stones/Weightstones give you a nice DPS boost if you're a melee class. I used them all the time when tanking dungeons for a nice threat boost.
---
Because you're 100% correct my dude.
---
Man I really want to at least get tier 1 but am starting to worry about time commitment and my wife actually hating me lol. Pray for us and those that we love.
---
I was in a raiding guild and we could only dream of doing Naxx. 
---
We had MC on farm and could down Rag reliably, and we were close on Vael in BWL. Also did plenty of ZG and AQ20 runs. 
---
Every now and then one of the 2 top guilds would pull some of us along for a BWL fill in or even a Naxx run when they needed some role that them and their feeder guild couldn't fill. That was super fun.
---
Once TBC came out, though, all classic raiding pretty much died. Without the need for 40 players, the guild split up into different cliques and some of the people who joined later, or want to raid more than 3 nights a week went their own way.
---
Still for those few months, it was a really awesome experience. (Leading a ZG run for the first time with the B team was where I first got the taste of leadership, which is helpful now that I'm an executive at a big company.)
---
People are suggesting things that were not addons in vanilla.
---
Maybe on classic+ in 2021. This server set is museum.
---
Hi! 
---
Do you have a bit of information about what classes you desperately need to complete raid? I am wanting to main either mage damage or druid healing and I wanted to make sure if I put in the work there would be a place for me.
---
Coyld probably find an eu realm that could work.  Ping might suck ass though
---
Not an issue for alliance. Paladins will trip over themselves to spec Ret and get a Nightfall.
---
For me it's going to be herbalism for gold, and then use the gold to level engineering.
---
Sorry but no they shouldn't.
---
That would open a can of worms of changes. paladins did have completely viable roles in pvp, tanking dungeons and raids (just not as tank)
---
keyboard turning as in , if you need to spin your character's facing direction 90 degrees to the right, you would just hold D for the 2-3 seconds it takes rather than holding down right mouse button and moving your mouse to the right (accomplishing the same thing in fractions of a second). you notice keyboard turners more in PVP than PVE, because theres no collision between players in wow, so anyone keyboard turning and fighting against another player that's running through them and jumping in/out of melee range will often miss a lot of uptime on their autos and abilities.
---
its less of a problem in PVE, but still a problem in an encounter where you need to quickly target adds that spawn in random locations.
---
Didn't Blizz do this with Mists of Pandaria?
---
If you manually tell your pet to attack, he talks a lot more.
---
My Imp during stress test was very chatty.
---
as strange as it sounds you may be able to find a guild on the EU servers as their times may sync up better for you 
---
not sure how bad the lag would effect you though
---
I played on AD as well and I recognize Romanov. I remember that guy being like a Warlock god!
---
sigh
---
You can also use it to lose combat status and re-enter rogue stealth, too. Useful both in PvE and bgs.
---
What’s a osrs?
---
Buuuut you have to play alliance, which is worse than a death sentence
---
4. Hunters forgetting to dismiss their pets
---
It literally is a money grab. Locking people into a sub where they might down the line unsub guarantees more money to Blizzard. Of course it would be beneficial for Blizzard but as consumers we should not support such practices.
---
I was even worse at the beginning, lol. I did not only click spells, but I was also clicking for every single autoattack hit. Omg
---
What about 15 year old chem trails?
---
Amazing
---
Shaman tanks are definitely viable, but only for content your guild has on farm hahah.
---
You're not my dads!
---
If you want to raid but not heal I wouldn't recommend enh.  The only justification I could see for enhance was if the guild really wanted someone to get high uptime from Nightfall procs, but being trusted for that in a raid and desired that way is the hurdle.
---
and reroll horde, like everyone else
---
lol what? The formula was from vanilla wow, and it was applied to Nostalrius. 
---
You have a habit of making baseless assumptions or straight up making false claims like '4 levels for crushing blows'.
---
Not that it's normal, but vanilla wow for Korean servers let their players keep their characters from beta to live (source: wow diary)
---
tbh when u watch a streamer playing WSG i see the same people over and over and over again... so thousands are abit much
---
I would rather stay in NA for the ping but maybe your suggestion will end up being what I do.
---
I dont think you produce sperm this young
---
fsshhhhh round' the corna
---
Old school runescape. 2007 version of runescape that was rereleased after the main game turned into shit, much like what happened with WoW. There’s now more players on OSRS than the main game and changes are implemented through community votes.
---
I highly recommend playing priest. You guys will basically be able to do dungeons whenever you want while leveling due to having tank and heals automatically covered. You'll also be able to easily duo any hard quests because you'll have good tankiness, damage, and healing. At 60 to gear up in dungeons it will be extremely easy to gear for whatever roles you want outside of raids by just running groups yourselves and picking up random dpsers.
---
Yeah seems like that won't happen. You might do Pick-Up raid now.
---
It just really depends on what you want out of your professions. For rogues, typically engineering + mining/herbalism is common, as you tend to make use of engineering a lot in PvP and in raids via dapper charges. Herb/Alch is a very good money maker especially if you can get the flask/pot recipes early on (on pservers, alchs who can make flasks usually sell flasks for mats + a 10g fee, which adds up quickly). 
---
If you have a mage alt, I assume that means you’ll be farming DM for gold on it. In that case, herb is a must have (2 guaranteed dreamfoil spawns in DME with a chance for a gromsblood). Having alchemy (for transmutes) or tailoring (for mooncloth) on an alt is also a nice way to make passive gold with little effort.
---
Yea it probably will I'm middle of Texas, but maybe it's the only way forward.
---
what is trolling and how does it work?
---
I always thought I played vanilla, until I checkedy wow history to find out I played December vanilla, and tbc was released In January. But it felt like I played vanilla because I didn't buy tbc until I hit 60 which was much, much later
---
How stupid can you be lol. One wall jump doesn’t make druids completely useless. Ur telling me ur gonna run the flags now? Druids are still king no matter what jumps are removed.
---
my brother did it after he hit like level ten and got into his 20s i think
---
Good now fix pets and feign death
---
Yeah, I should have re-read that. You are correct.
---
I think that its a given that the masses have high knowledge after 15 years. OP arguing otherwise is silly.
---
I am not convinced that everybody can execute to the degree touted around here (mostly pvp standpoint), but I am anxious to be proven wrong.
---
Never going to happen, nor would I ever want it to for Classic Vanilla.  Hopefully they progress to TBC and beyond and you can play your pally however you want to then.
---
Romanov was awesome! Played a lot with him.
---
Oh. Runescape was never good though.
---
Strongly disagree. Were not talking about some unknown game where it could be shit at launch. I know exactly what I’m buying and playing as well as the majority of people that would do the 6 month sub. We’re not talking EA preorders here, I played classic for like 3500 hours lol.
---
Blizzard heard you and fixed them in TBC
---
That would be true if in WoD the game wasn't set to change between old and new models. New models CAN use the old animations, since the new animations were introduced in Legion.
---
I'm going paladin or warlock, with mounts being harder to obtain than in live WoW, I plan on saving myself quite the gold to ensure that I'm able to do other things if I wish.
---
omfg Sleeve the rogue with a billion HK's. Sandisk the legendary troll. Haven't heard those names forever. 
---
When did you play? I was Ally for most of my time there. Raided with Exodus and Section 8
---
nah man, he wasn't trolling ... seriously, this dude is straight up delusional.
---
Name your price sir
---
They'll steal aggro and have to heal themselves since they take much more damage than a tank.
---
I'm aussie so it's usually pretty dead unless I stay up into the early hours of the morning. However there's been a few people I've come across from nz and we grouped up and hung out. It's been pretty positive. I'm taking it very slow and forcing myself not to log in most days as I do t want to be burnt out once it releases.
---
"Perfect for world of warcraft" lol what a joke
---
UBRS always reminds me of Oxhorn's ROFLMAO song lol
---
wild ride, thanks
---
Yeah man, I'm in the same exact boat as you. My schedule changes basically ever 2 months which is going to make raiding consistently a pain. I'm pretty much looking at playing a healer so I CAN raid as easy as possible.
---
My vanilla guild ended on the twin emps so I never even saw naxx but I really wanna clear it this time around and I think being a healer will give me the best opportunity with achieving that.
---
Yeah that's as annoying as hunters that pre trap/flare vs rogues
---
Add rum to vanilla Coke
---
Just get into a decent guild. They will be doing content early asap so people generally have had limited time to get gear.
---
By this patch it is 100% confirmed. Will not proc on SS.
---
Again: What in that comment makes you feel the OP is "promoting"? I'm not trying to be offensive against you either, I just think it's interesting when ppl interpret written things differently.
---
One of my favorite things in TBC/WotLK was to make an alt and join a leveling guild.
---
So hilarious to join a guild full of a bunch of teenagers arguing over who the biggest badass was when they were in the 30-40 level range.
---
Taking them to dungeons they didn’t even know existed and listening to them try to plan strategies in party chat.
---
Meanwhile my main was in Sunwell or later on rocking a Shadowmourne and the LoD title.
---
I think being a noob and the journey to figuring the game out is part of falling for WoW.
---
Alternative and early forms of game mastery being removed from WoW was a big mistake. When the game is designed so you can’t fail or have an inefficient build or when there aren’t early areas of the game for you to master it’s pretty boring.
---
Starting with my OG Rogue with talents all over the place to a proper sword spec somewhere in the early 40s was a lightbulb situation and one where my gameplay and character effectiveness went through the roof.
---
I did everything up to Twin Emps in Vanilla. I haven't played on private servers, so this is from the perspective of a veteran.
---
I think people somehow believe Vanilla stops at Molten Core, which was actually pretty easy. The challenge there was managing 40 people. I can see dedicated guild clearing it pretty quickly indeed.
---
But starting with BWL, encounters did become genuinely demanding. The very first fight needed quite a bit of coordination since you usually didn't have the gear to brute force it. This is where most guilds will start to wipe and progression will slow down.
---
Now, will people who have been playing on private servers recently progress faster? For sure. But I think they'll be a small portion of the player base, probably less than 10%. The rest will be a mix of returning players, like myself, and people who have never played Vanilla. 
---
So all in all, I think progress will be a bit faster than 15 years ago but not as blazingly fast as people seem to think.
---
4 stacks only
---
They have infinite uses my man
---
One thing: let people learn things through experience sometimes. Telling people every tactic is, in my opinion, not fun.
---
I'm willing to spend 2 hours trying to log in for every stress test if it means that wont be the case at launch.
---
Or like the parent comment suggested, just run it with fewer people regardless of their gear level. That's probably less of a headache.
---
We'll have to wait for some hard numbers to see how many people you'd want to limit to in order to preserve some semblance of difficulty, but there may be some incentive to do so (significantly less competition for loot, namely).
---
Everyone filled out talent points in a weird way, because you couldn't inspect talents until the Armory came about near the very end of Vanilla.  The amount of feral druids who refused to respec and went to raids as healers, or moonkins healing, was staggering.  And yet, we still cleared the raids.  
---
What you see here are the masses of private server players that never actually played Vanilla, and certainly didn't raid in Vanilla.  The hardest part about raiding was getting 40 people to show up on time.
---
I would argue that with such a low amount of players being able to see or experience that end game content, we don't have a goog idea of what that content was all about. It's very reasonable to that in a day where information is widely much more accesible, has way more eyes on it that Vanilla is actually in fact easier than people remember.
---
This dudes being a bit pedantic. I've been in top 500 world guilds for probably 14 months put together across all the expacs, and even raiding at that level I had plenty of "life." A guild of truly excellent players can be top 500 with only 6 hours of raiding a week (two nights). Throw in MAYBE another 10 hours of extra-raid activities to keep enough gold to supply your own potions etc., and you'll be fine.
---
That said, your guild and your players do have to be truly EXCELLENT and really know the ins and outs of their classes to pull off that kind of raid schedule in modern mythic raiding. I'd imagine you basically just have to have 40 people who can pay attention for two hours to clear MC consistently.
---
Because people do and the new generation of gamers burn out on games a lot faster than ever before.
---
That was a different "exploit." IIRC he basically had a rogue or 2 auto-attack him with sharpened letter openers for a really long time to accumulate stacks.
---
All paladin guides mention it.
---
I guess ww axe is still more well known since there are more warriors, and warriors usually keep it for a long time (because 30+ leveling is slower)
---
Still a very iconic weapon this one.
---
I love that in your little world. Making sure you videos are able to be monetized is  some offense. People like you are cancer.
---
Please keep Achievements away from Classic.
---
You can have goals without a trophy case giving you unspendable imaginary score points.
---
Pets aren't really a hinderance and add a lot to the character.  Hunters are really engaging to play, contrary to popular belief.  They have one of the higher skill ceilings in the game.

 **Who we are:** &lt;Birds Of A Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.
---
**What we are looking for:** Someone who is dedicated. We require 80% attendance otherwise you may be subbed out. We understand things happen but just don’t make a habit of it. Someone who can raid on Tuesday and Thursday between the hours of 7PM/8PM EST to 10PM /11PM EST. Someone with a good attitude, doesn’t rage, and doesn’t complain. Someone who is willing to help others and is team-focused and not individual focused. Someone who is competent, willing to learn, and ask questions if they don’t understand so they can do it right.
---
**How we operate:** As stated above we will be raiding two days a week sometime between 7-11ishPM EST on Tuesday and Thursday. As for loot we will be running Loot Council. The team will decide how to distribute loot based on several factors including (but not limited to): Attendance, performance in raids (Moreso your ability to listen and do mechanics as opposed to pulling high numbers.), what you contribute to the guild (helping other players, crafting/enchanting things for people, etc.),  and just helping the guild in general.
---
**What we are recruiting:** Healers, Warriors, Mages &amp; Warlocks
---
You can contact me on discord @ frail\_#3482
---
Probably all personal. I’m gonna play the game at my pace and don’t really care if I hit 60 when the try herds do 
---
If you wanna level fast, I wouldn’t worry about it
---
vendoring leather and transforming thick leather into vendorable items plays a huge part in pouring gold into the economy.
---
I raided with Civilian very briefly in Wrath! I was a Resto Shaman by the name Kryptyk.
---
Pretty sure it was during ICC
---
Certainly do. I played Disc Priest and it took like 5 tries to dispel innervate through barskin if lucky. And they easily ran across the whole arena to drink.
---
My point is: it's not necessarily an unhealthy relationships even though the OP played every single day (except one) since release.
---
OP also didn't say anything about "can't" enjoy a vacation without downloading the game.
---
Yes, it sure does look like a somewhat unhealthy relationship, but not necessarily.
---
edit: typo
---
Which healing class has the easiest time solo farming at 60?
---
Dunno, I can't wait for classic, but I want the real thing not beta too much :(
---
With modern tech Evey class can have this now. No need to alt tab just have whatever running on the second monitor.
---
A little off. He says druid is VERY good prebis, but does not get a lot of upgrades until AQ.
---
Wait ... I din't know this was 15 man at some point. how will it be when classic launches?
---
That's the spirit! Same here. Taken vacation for the launch - I'd hate to get stuck not playing in that time xD
---
^
---
For someone that brought age into this early you act really immature. Either you are young or.. well the second option is sad.  Take care I got better things to do.
---
You need 75(?) for your poison quest so you should definitely level to that on your first lockpicking quest(on barrens pirate ship or redridge spider sawmill thing). Other than that, I prefer leveling things like this at 60 when I'm sitting waiting for dungeon runs. Lockpicking is not really that important to rush.
---
You can heal fine with 30 0 21 as long as your guild doesn't need your manatide for raids. I think paladin is similar, you dont have to go all the way down the holy tree to raid. You could even run a holy ret hybrid.
---
Because new games make you burn out. Classic is not a new game^^
---
Use the pickpocket macro to pull locked boxes from npcs prior to rolling over them.
---
That way you can level up lock picking as you go, much easier than going back at 60 and pulling the boxes, or spamming trade/ah for them
---
If you had an active sub and your account was created and had game time during actual vanilla then you should have been in this beta. It's that simple. Sure you can make the streamer argument with marketing but dude that's just greed. That's the way it should be.
---
that's CTmod raidframes
---
I dont thing vanilla was ever hard lvling or raid wise. It was a long process. Having to think before you pull something vs running in not caring has been how I assume people use hard vs easy. WoW has always been the easy mmo. I had no idea what I was doing at 15 yet I still found myself in endgame content because I could listen to hey mage get decursive and make us water. Sheep this. Just because you have to use cc and not just mass pull everything doesnt make it harder. It makes it more immersive
---
Season? do you only play fortnite or somethibg?
---
I’m rolling lock. I’ve always played hunter/Druid end game then monk later on. Locks are just versatile for PvP and PvE.
---
Pallies were actually one of the most efficient  healers when using the right ranks of spells.
---
I was a holy paladin running around with the ice barbed spear. Then I finally learned and just twinked 19.
---
Still deciding between mage/lock. One will be main, one will be alt.
---
Can't decide if the free mount is more worthwhile first character around, or if teleport/aoe gold farming is the more valuable option.
---
I love both gameplays equally from what i've been messing around with.
---
Can't wait for it to lose 75% of the playerbase after 6 months
---
I'm taking a week off, too.  And fucking up my sleep pattern due to the 6pm EST launch.  I know quest completion and mob competition will be stiff but just let me in the damn game.
---
So, I recently leveled a rogue to 60 on a private server, it was a brand new server. It simulated what we’re all about to do with Classic. I personally leveled my lock picking while I was leveling, it didn’t take long at all. The worst part is the initial leveling process when you get Lock picking, other than that, you can go lock pick like every 5-10 levels to catch it up. I think like each level gives you 5 more lock picking to level? Anyways, I hit 60 at a decent rate with the rest of the server.
---
I dont watch Towelliee, but why would people care if anyone vapes?
---
Fuck, how’d you know each and every bg was like this until Xrealm?
---
Cats outta the bag boys, we can stop the charade, he caught us.
---
Avengers mother fucking shield
---
Just finished my first year too, and 27th is also my second day into fall semester! I have the same C=fail standard. That being said, i plan to do a 72hr session starting day one. My only fall classes are grant writing and ethics, who needs it?!?
---
Wow this is old. Haven't seen this in so long.
---
my dude! same here i will help people out as much as possible
---
You can use pservers to help you out with this. Also there's a bunch of YT videos out there to help you decide as well, with info of experiences you wouldn't be able to test out in beta anyway (in this thread, both the generic overview and the indepth class ones https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b5mh0e/wow_classic_class_guides_resources/)
---
You take that back right now.
---
The horde is just like "Sit down and just let it happen."
---
Is it really hard to grasp that a large number of people, of both genders. Would prefer to play as a gender of character that matches their own identity? My girlfriend always picks the female option too.
---
Paladin and priest both have a very easy time farming DME lashers once phase 2 hits. Priests just spam holy nova (only requirement is having roughly 6k mana) and palas just use consecration and semi-afk until the lashers die. Priest is a little quicker, but both are easy.
---
P1 has limited farm spots for solo play as a priest, not 100% sure about paladins.
---
I agree. I had access to the TBC beta back in the days because my roommate went to work for Blizz, but playing a beta in a MMO somehow beats the purpose of developing your character. Why should I pick up that flower when everything gets deleted soon? It's only good for planning your levels and since most of us know classic (or just use a pserver) the main reason would be to report bugs and help Blizzard. And I'm pretty confident there are people out there that invest more time in doing that as I could ever do. So I just wait here and wonder what to play for the next 3 months...
---
SHUT UP YOU DONT UNDERSTAND !
---
Black Mirror flashbacks intensify.
---
I am inevitable.
---
cheers kiddo :)
---
How do people gear up in Druid? Let's say you're a feral tank and you need healing gear for resto raid, but there's a healer in the group. Do you just give it to them or do you roll it as well? Wouldn't that piss the healer off?
---
Humans?
---
Okay, so still OP haha.
---
I really wanted to roll a druid (feral), as it's been my favorite class on WoW since I first played on WOTLK, but I keep hearing they're pretty bad, it's kind of a chore to play them, you can pretty much be a healer only and you're not even that good at healing.
---
So I'm pondering between a mage, warlock or even priest, but mostly Mage X Warlock.
---
I know that mages are pretty strong in classic and they have a ton of utility spells that really makes your life easier.
---
But what about warlocks? I don't know too much about warlocks, specially in vanilla wow. How viable are the specs? Both in PVP and PVE (I'll most likely focus on PVP, tho)
---
I’m assuming FFG stands for “Family Friends Guild”? I don’t think it’s stated in the post.
---
And the infinite 30 day bag known as the mailbox.
---
PREDICTED DISCORD.GG
---
Druid imo
---
I think his point is alts not getting free "everything". Leveling a second character to 60 is still hundreds of hours
---
It gives you +5 in stealth.  It's the equivalent of 2.5 points in Master of Deception.
---
Ah back when  mosaic's were actually mosaic. Shortly after this everyone just took a bunch of small images at 50% opacity and put it over a larger image.
---
In EU we had a guy from Hawaii who played with us and the ping wasn't that bad.
---
i never played wow before cuz i never wanted to pay sub as a kid. instead i played gw/sw tor and loved it.
---
now i have spare time cuz shift work, and boring nightshifts so i can play this easy. just cant wait for classic and watching streams is just killing me.
---
in meantime i started retail wow to see which class i will like, and im lv73 otlw rogue now (which i like, even rotation is weird (RNG based, and get outdmg by other rougues just spamming flurry and autoattack), and dont have any friends in game, just one who said he will help me with bags and starter gold ( which he didnt, but i dont need anything in this stage ). 
---
doing dungeons is fast paced and weird cuz no comunication with lfg tool. cant get storyline right cuz im getting bounced in different dungeons, and started areas are nice and local storyline so far.
---
so its hard to get in this game late, cuz all the rest of ppl are just doing some m+ raids, and i cant catch up. ppl arent social and just rushing things.
---
so from classic i wanna find friendly social guild, get some friends, and have two players. one for pve support build which is needed by guild (prolly priest), and rogue for pvp/pve fun.
---
Yes tank group
---
No it's not. Hell there is a guild on beta with close to a thousand people in it. 
---
They are simulating a server population. There are at least 3+ thousand on beta.
---
I always looked at it based on their stats. 1-3 is for strength, 4-6 is Agility, and 7-9 is intellect.
---
It holds a soft spot in my heart as it was the first MMO I ever played as a kid prior to playing vanilla WoW.
---
Wait you want to give one faction an advantage by giving them a fully functional tank class? What’s wrong with shamans? They are fucking strong as fuck so they better have some drawbacks.
---
Plenty of new games are amazing, it is the modern way people are that they will play something for a week then be done.
---
I struggle to find people online to play with who will stick to a game for a month or not be desperate to buy the latest thing.
---
Any mmo or mmorpg should last more than a month typically, it is typically the player's fault if they get bored of the game after a week, 2 weeks or a month.
---
You started and keep responding to me. No one asked you to give your 2c on the matter, but here you are.
---
Prior to gear, Hunter. Once gear is obtained probably a Warlock. Mage's are also fine all around.
---
Good thing that they no longer work
---
Little Note: Normally Warsong was a slaughter if both teams went in with their main setup. But if either team missed a few core players, the other team pretty much had a free win. So we often met for a few minutes on random places and did whatever we felt like until the flag was carried 3 times.
---
I was a casual player.  No one wanted to trust a feral tank in pre BiS compared to a warrior who had raid gear. My guild already their tanks set up
---
Yeah, not only Steam but Blizzard does that too.
---
okay i've made a mistake regarding crushing blow because that was changed during wrath but the DR formula is the same everywhere except that nostalrius post and doesn't include player level (one is even sourced by original blizzard UI) and asmon was only 1 level lower so again it doesnt apply ;p
---
Ok I'll probably try it with all these suggestions
---
This was really helpful, Thanks!
---
Most guilds give priority to main spec, if no mains need it then it’s open to offspec.
---
&gt; Do you really want to play the starter zones with a thousand other players? 
---
..... yes? Hell yes.
---
Most classes and specs are fine as they are. It’s itemization that hinders and makes others excel. Good Plate strength and crit gear is abundant hence warriors being top tier dps. They’re the best raid MT because they take the least damage as most bosses deal primarily physical damage to their target, despite feral druids doing more threat (than deep prot).
---
Confirmed - I did this with a 29 hunter twink back in vanilla for the gun. Just make sure you grind from 28 &gt; 29 not quest hand in so you’re not too far into the level.
---
Bruh I can barely get a level per hour, so.etimes two hours, because its nearly impossible to tag quest mobs. Way too many people contesting for quests.
---
Really want a semi-serious PVP guild with young adults who can crack jokes but also be serious when it’s the proper time to be. Also needs to enjoy the little things in the game and if your gonna rage over a video game, well I don’t wanna be in that guild.
---
Most things are staying the same. 
---
When I’m drink8mg and go to cast a spell I don’t automatically stand up. But when I go to turn in a quest with full bags, the game lets me swap the quest item for the reward. In 1.12, I had to free up a space then do the turnin. 
---
Completely new features like right click reporting, 2hour raid loot trading, and layering are a result of the legitimate economic concerns Blizzard has with this product. 
---
Nearly everything else is as it was.
---
okay, weird that its always the same people everywhere lol but i believe you
---
It has been good, group invites for open world quests happen often enough. Information is freely shared via general chat or /whisper . Also plenty of pvp warnings are seen and calls for assistance. I have had a few randoms add me to friends list and I have added them as well.  
---
Most people are ok with you politely helping them understand CC or tactics and chest rolling etiquette. Most of them say oh yeah sorry its just been awhile since I played vanilla. 
---
Economy has been reasonable for a fresh server. Also some people are apt to trade around free items or cheaply trade items. I was healing WC and one fight we started I was low on mana and after the fight was done, the hunter in the group randomly gave me 2 minor mana potions for free.
---
and there is this  [https://www.wowhead.com/news=291845/elite-npc-damage-is-not-way-off-in-classic-wow-blizzard-reply](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291845/elite-npc-damage-is-not-way-off-in-classic-wow-blizzard-reply)  which was beyond convincing
---
It’s not that I “care” about who has played during actual Vanilla. It’s interesting to me to see how many people actually got that experience, and how many people will be able to experience it for a first time.. I hope you and your husband have a great time leveling! I know I’ll enjoy every bit of the game :)
---
You're working under the assumption the game will decline in popularity as time goes on.
---
What if the opposite is true?  What if 3 months after launch there are still 10k players online on a single realm?  How do you disable layering then?
---
I think I did the same tbh 😂
---
I think the word you’re looking for is pessimistic? Anyway, I am a pretty decent gamer and there is so much info out there these days that I am sure you’re right!!
---
I WILL get tier 1 💪💪💪
---
The only class I feel that’s been hard done by is hunters. So much effort and gameplay around a pet to not make it scale with the hunters gear. 
---
A bloody talent could’ve fixed this
---
(Maybe druids too please give ooc res)
---
Its really tough to get through the late 30's / 40's in vanilla, many a character died in that range :P
---
&gt; 1.12
---
You're lying to yourself, my dude. 1.12 only nerfed Uldaman, ZF, and Maraudon. Everything else was untouched. You can see the patch notes [here](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0).
---
Looking for 15 more members.
---
**Who we are:** &lt;Birds Of A Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.

**How we operate:** As stated above we will be raiding two days a week sometime between 7-11ishPM EST on Tuesday and Thursday. As for loot we will be running Loot Council.

---
Yeah you're right. Blizzard is banking on their assumption that the population is going to plummet in just a couple of weeks. If they overestimate it and more people stick around, layering will have to become permanent.
---
but diablo 3 is already a bastardization of 1 and 2
---
You can also press the "Not Interested" button (the X next to the red Subscribe button) and the channel will not appear for you.
---
And you can quit any time you'd like. Just like heroine. :)
---
For my friend, the naxx trailer by hurricane did it for him
---
Nothing is particularly wrong with the BFA community. It's just that the game is designed in such a way that it doesn't really feel like an MMO. So you aren't really interacting that often in game. 
---
Vanilla had a mostly good community, and my interactions in beta have been positive so far, but I think it'll go downhill when it launches. The private server communities are among the worst in gaming
---
This sub is not a healthy community. Lots of troubled folks here who have invested far too much of their self worth into this game being everything they've ever wanted.
---
Underrated comment
---
What other classes have a similar weapon quest? All of them? Which other ones are notable?
---
This sounds like me, call me interested.
---
Can people stop using the word retail wow to describe BFA? classic isn't a private server and as such it is an official product being sold, so both classic and BFA are "Retail", if anything we should name BFA modern wow.
---
PS: this is a bug even though it's not software related and is relevant to classic so don't remove the comment please :p
---
I played Tibia until WoW.
---
My first main was a Druid, and I loved being able to do everything, especially in the world. I'm torn between doing that again vs. rolling e.g. a Priest, because I didn't have the experience in vanilla of playing a class that was really the best at something.
---
heres more  [http://wow.allakhazam.com/wiki/Armor\_%28WoW%29#Formula\_For\_Armor](http://wow.allakhazam.com/wiki/Armor_%28WoW%29#Formula_For_Armor) 
---
player level doesnt matter
---
What server/zone are you playing? Like I said, I'm 41 now and I've just finished STV. Not very many people in STV at all, think I saw 2 hordies in total throughout STV.
---
I think I managed to skip the wave of new players as I was already level 15 when the beta dropped so I'm ahead of the curve.
---
Then something about your setup is seriously fucked up.
---
I've not had this problem on Arch (no longer using), nor on Ubuntu (work laptop), nor on Pop!OS (personal laptop.)
---
I use Chrome on all three. 
---
Granted, I don't have 500 tabs open.
---
You had me till the alliance part
---
Sorry I meant in 5 man dungeon PUGs. Like you play as a tank in say Stratholme but need some of the healing gear there to set yourself up at MC. But there's a healer (e.g priest) in the group who needs it as well. Do you just roll (to prevent pissing them off) or give it to them seeing as that's their main spec?
---
Limewire...lol
---
Thank you for your work.
---
Wow, what a long reply. I don’t care about him or anything, thanks OP that I can filter him out now from youtube. He still sucks massively for someone playing wow all day.
---
Actually they do care. In some countries the sub is adjusted to something around 8 US dollars.
---
Tuning differences aside its a great way to determine which class mechanically is fun if you've been away. Turns out I'm a weanie and don't like combo points that are target dependent!
---
https://discordapp.com/invite/2r25M8Z
---
still have the same gf?
---
Someone needs to confirm this.  But I’ve heard a couple times skills cost a little more for these two classes.  However you still end up saving good especially for your 40 mount since you aren’t buying all of your abilities anyway.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
If one team is way stronger than the other you get this situation where the weaker side gives up to move onto the next game faster.
---
There have been plenty of bugs found by the testers. Yes they are getting great twitch exposure. But I do feel like the testing has helped find and fix a few problems. 
---
Massive amounts? No but that really goes to show how far along the dev team is. The beta has had less bugs than BFA did 3 months into launch.  I’d rather have a crisp perfect launch. The better the launch the better game we all get. 
---
Only thing I’d change on is the amount of people in the beta. I feel like opening up 5 more servers and inviting that many more to populate it would be good. More people. More chances to catch bugs. 
---
I am happy I got in on day one. I have been testing leveling routes and best ways to level professions. Have not come across many bugs but have reported the few I have come across. 
---
It has also let people see what they are getting into. Will it cut down on “tourists”? Probably not but a least a larger number of them will know what they are signing up for. Let’s be honest the first month of Classic release Live will be a ghost town.
---
Yeah it's true but not to the same extent
---
Unfortunately I think you're right, with so the info out now, especially with the "hard core" guilds.
---
Hej :)
---
&gt;Is the server going to be a retail community moving Classic? I would assume so otherwise how do you know there will be a lot of Swedes?
---
No pre-planned moving, no. Stormscale has always been a "Swedish" realm, from vanilla to BfA, so I'm assuming Swedes will automatically fill it once again Classic comes. It'll naturally become a Swedish server, I'm 99% sure of it.
---
That’s only due to enchants which weren’t available to them
---
If you don't take your meds you don't get your check.and they drug test you to see of you are taking your meds.
---
Again, because you’ve tied an obnoxious emotion to the use of too many “cuss” words. Everyone has their own opinion sure, but tying meaning to words is not a progressive or intellectual though process. Anyway, it doesn’t bother me to get downvoted because who gives a fuck about karma but I’ll see myself out as there’s no point in further discussion. Have a good one friend.
---
Seems like they got some people that they believed would be good for beta testing; some old accounts, different hardware, different geographical locations, etc. Then they loaded the servers up with as many "influencers", streamers, and youtubers. Even those streamers that have never played WoW were invited to just advertise the game.
---
Really not the place for this, advertise in the LFG thread or on the discord, don't spam the sub.
---
Kargoz rogue guide still mentions frontstab
---
The hardest part about wailing caverns was the jump.
---
Played mage in vanilla and my best friend then was a warlock. Farming soul shards seemed like much more of a chore than making water for a group and I liked having portals. He was a god once we got to t2 level gear though and ran SL/SL build. Don't think you can go wrong either way just know you'll be forced to be frost if you raid the first tier.
---
That’s some elitist shit right there lol
---
Thanks man. Darkspeer raptor is in vanilla?
---
Paging /r/iamverysmart
---
Exactly. I’m lucky enough I found a group that will bring me to MC to be shown the ropes while I play on a half dead illegal server but that’s one day a week. I am glad I’m not on beta and feeling compelled to level because I will be doing that in 3 months but it will be permanent.
---
As a psychologist, i can say that the WHO has lost its credibility a long time ago. Just read the definition catefully. They claim that if you prefer gaming over 'other activities' (not defined), you have a mental health problem.
---
5 years -&gt; 100 days / year -&gt; 6.5h/day 
---
7 h sleep, 1.5h misc, 8h work/school/whatever, 6.5h gaming, 1h spare. + 16h "spare time" per weekend
---
I'm glad I'm not in the beta, it would ruin my summer.
---
Kinda what I remember
---
What a dramatic title.
---
Yes, because it will have my old friends in it.
---
23, time of my life, gaming wise
---
People who are in the stress test, can you get to to the "realm list" screen where it shows the server offline yet?
---
Im creating my own guild, mostly to encourage weird and fun specs.
---
No way im going to join the tryhards.
---
I also will miss Ring menu :(
---
Nope,  they dont expire
---
No. I wouldn’t. You guys put WAY to much importance on getting in to betas.
---
I started just after vanilla. I played a druid. I leveled as balance from 10-70. I am noob incarnate.
---
100% Vanilla. At least they are still working on it.
---
QoL will probably come from Addons even thoses you don't wan't.
---
We don't need more streamers trying to cash in.
---
We need more non-famous players who will do the work instead of dicking around on camera.
---
Blizz has already Frankensteined the game with sharding. If they buffed the content, I don’t think the No Changes crowd will care. Once you add sharding, all bets are off.
---
Oh, really? Where do I go to redeem that? I have a ton of reputation as I was active when the site first launched.
---
We’re talking about what’s going to happen in Classic not what has already happened in BFA.
---
It's going to be worse than current retail
---
Alright I'll give this a go when the time comes. Thanks for the advice.
---
12
---
Id be looking at playing casual and leveling in my own pace, so it will mostly be solo. Classes Ive enjoyed in the past was mage, paladin, rogue. Any advice/do’s/dont’s would be appriciated for someone with no classic experience!
---
Edit: open for anything
---
Or Norse by norsewest for the ps1
---
It’s true. RuneScape was easily accessible and was many players first mmo.
---
Anyone not playing on N.dale is playing a much more inaccurate version of classic, N.dale being the closest to it ( I've tried them all).
---
&gt;Can't decide if the free mount is more worthwhile
---
free mount yes. But people don't mention that warlocks have 4 times as many spells to buy for their pets.
---
&gt;There 100% exists players that would be willing to put aside fun and entertaining content to make the game we love work properly.
---
Is it not working properly now?
---
less than a year before it has end of life though
---
Bro, Same. August can’t get here fast enough. I’m having fun testing other classes now that I’ve capped my warrior at 30. I am the only one in my friends circle that got in tho. I have enjoyed playing with the folks I’ve met in the beta but I want to play with my Wife, brother and friends.  Wife is a Legion baby. Really looking forward to playing classic with her. She doesn’t like the rush rush rush of current WoW.
---
No.  The community will be worse.  You have people that believe Classic is equatable to Vanilla, but MMOs are anchored in the popular culture of their time.  The community will basically be the same, except you will have an air of smugness in Classic.
---
The part that cracks me up is the people with green shirts and alliance symbols that had to be used for Thrall. Vice versa for Varian.
---
Warlocks spend the most money on spells...because pets.
---
25. Crushed once, shall crush again.
---
It's incorrect.
---
As a beginner, the priest will be the best I think. You have the best pure healing spec in the game, and will have the most flexibility. Downranking is not as tricky as it sounds, for the most part having 2 ranks of your main heals is all you'll do (with max ranks of everything else). 
---
This means, 2 ranks of Prayer of Healing and 2 ranks of Heal, the rest (lesser heal, which is your quick cast, renew, PW:S) you'd likely just have one rank of. 
---
As a priest you also won't have to make the choice between plate and cloth/leather gear on your toon, as you can only use cloth. Best in slot gear for a pally healer will definitely be some cloth/leather pieces which can be off-putting for some.
---
I think when they say "anti alt" they don't mean you can't make alts. I think they mean and, tbh the logic does not apply well to a snow globe. But what I think they mean is the game is less "flavor of the month" friendly. Because it takes sooo long to turn the ship of state. Yea you can get a another guy to 60. How ever if your main is already rocking his full kit. You have months of raiding to do to catch up.
---
The stun resist is pretty outstanding 
---
But if you are a bull at heart, be the bull
---
I was just recently thinking about how Game Cards used to come in a big “game” box like that xD I just got a game card and it is basically a Gift card with no box lol
---
love how this has went to 
---
' hey guys played vanilla wow on classic and private servers for 8 years ' 
---
to 
---
' yeah i actually only played wrath so don't get mad at me for being wrong '
---
you seem like a cool guy.
---
Ok but your still on the same playing field. 
---
Just like all highschoolers can be on the same football team yet they’re different skill levels, you don’t put your star running back in a middle school game just to make a highlight video.
---
What a pointless reply.
---
No not Dire Maul, he's talking about VC.
---
League of legends, counter strike, rocket league, overwatch, fifa, apex legends, diablo. The list is immense. They all have seasons.
---
problem is aggro range of the pet when you try to avoid patrols, remember a lot of wipe with no explanation as tank before saw clearly the pet getting shutdown by some mobs
---
Sorry did not mean to make the title overly dramatic, but there are many off values and bugs still present in the game.
---
**BUG**
---
14 hours ago saw streamer lockpick training boxes https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Buccaneer%27s_Strongbox and they didn't freeze/hex him a single time.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/object=178244/practice-lockbox
---
People talk still in 2.4.1 about the effects so it definitely should be there!
---
It’s a public forum on the internet, dumbass, no one has to ask me.
---
God, we abused that Levitate bug so much in WotLK in the name of exploration. Easily my favorite time in WoW.
---
I too would like a beta invite lol
---
Ragnarok!, obv Classic is the goat though. BC was so close to goat status but, they flying mounts and heroic tokens just make it fall short.
---
yes, [here](https://i.imgur.com/LjrLwKx.jpg) is what it looked like
---
oh hey, could you PM that to me too? (does this need to be a secret?)
---
How supersaturated will resto shamans be? I want to do a ele/resto hybrid build for raiding and pvp.
---
&gt; You forgot to account for sleep.
---
No I didn't. I would not put it past Method to have people level in shifts on the location so they avoid possible IP banning.
---
I guess my first character was a mage, but i only made it to lvl 11 or so before i made a warlock.  That was my first max level toon (in Wrath).
---
This time around im going to go priest.  Partially because im more comfortable with healing (and want to get into groups), but mostly because FUCK soul shards, especially without soulwell.  I just dont want to deal with that crap this time around lol
---
Working properly to an extent,  and while Blizzard is definitely receiving lots of data, there are several interactions and values that don't seem 100% correct.
---
Which is more pleasing to you: 
---
1) Occasionally having the word Resist appear over your character for half a second, or
---
2) Ending a fight with just 2% of your health left and *knowing* that if you'd picked *any other race* you'd be running back to your corpse right now.
---
Sulfuras is a mace after all, not the ideal weapon base for dueling. I remember the first person on my server getting it and dueling people outside Org. Went toe-to-toe with him and won the first duel (warrior vs warrior), I believe I was using a plain old arcanite reaper at the time. Thing still hits hard as a truck though, but the crits from it are relatively rare.
---
Stop watching. Take a break. Go outside.
---
its working quite well despite the there being bugs here and there
---
I have heard many say that BFA launched in a worse state than where the beta is now
---
Do you raid Rag or MC? 
---
So its DM not Van Clief.
---
Even if I die in this battle, i will stand my ground
---
And thicc orc fems
---
They lose interest because they know any progress is pointless
---
the only point of playing is fun and well progression is fun
---
not to say other things arn't but its a big factor
---
It's beautiful thank you for sharing! I hope they bring this feature back :)
---
There's no way to 'spend' reputation points - things unlock at various levels (similar to other site privileges you've unlocked if you have a lot of rep).
---
https://www.wowhead.com/privileges you can click on each option here to learn more about what they provide.
---
I thought the OP version was the one that one shot Kazzak
---
Discord (and Slack) is basically modern IRC....
---
I’m already burned out from the beta. Not really much point in sinking hours and hours of more time into it when it’s all going to be wiped anyway.
---
I didn't have a working pc until about two months before bc came out so sadly my only vanilla experience thus far was 4 different characters to level 30 and private servers
---
Shhhh! He's trying to guilt he world into a beta invite
---
&gt;seem
---
Compared to what? Your memory? Your experience from private servers? Or have you been comparing streamer footage to 2005 YouTube videos?
---
Terrible advice.
---
If you want to raid, know the fights and be prepared - by that I mean consumables and apropriate resist gear. If you're not running with your guild who knows you, you're likely not getting a slot as a boomkin, recognize that you'll likely have to heal. 
---
Off-meta stuff becomes prevalent once you're established in a guild, and the leadership recognizes your skill and value and gives you opportunities to play as a boomkin or an enhance shaman or a ret paladin, not in pugs. Pugs/lower end raids will always adhere to the meta closer than more progressed groups, because its easier.
---
Yeah it’s been getting harder to find motivation to grind in OSRS as Classic gets closer to release.
---
There's no reason it wouldn't be in. [clicky](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=5052)
---
Yea that's a interesting point.
---
I get people skipping professions when leveling due to money concerns, with regards to getting their 40 and 60 mounts. The argument that it might be quicker or easier to grind out once you have your epic mount and have a bit of disposable gold.
---
But as far as saving time overall, I'm not sure that it would. For me though, it's a moot point, because part of my enjoyment of the leveling experience is working on crafting, cooking, fishing etc along the way.
---
My two mains have always been warlock and priest. Did lock first in vanilla, never seriously raided vanilla on priest. So switching up this time around. Lock can farm to support the priest raiding.
---
Courtesy is usually MS -&gt; OS I'd say if you're playing in feral, and need a healer staff, if the person who is currently healing needs the staff then let them have first dips.
---
Really? I thought they had the easiest farming because of the side step hamstring move
---
I don't care if I personally get in...... It seems they are inviting people who don't want to play , i.e summit.    I have no animosity towards streamers and think that hate is completely unjustified.
---
Are you NA or EU?
---
I had just turned 24, it was the summer. I remember looking over my roommate's shoulder as he was playing this beta for a new game called World of Warcraft.
---
I had played the Humans vs Orc game before and was familiar with the Blizzard name, but was relatively unware of this game. I was instantly enthralled as I watched him run around Goldshire as a human male warrior, killing wolves for some reason. I thought it was pretty neat and continued to watch him play.
---
A half hour later, I had pulled up a chair beside him and simply watched him play. Eventually he had his fill and let me have a go at it. 
---
I've been hooked ever since.
---
Oh wow! Was totally unaware this existed, definitely spotted some familiar names in there already
---
&gt; Tons of drive by heals and buffs.
---
I remember getting jumpscares from the random heals&amp;buffs in Vanilla when I wasn't expecting them.
---
Shit dude I'm half way to making Hunger strike for beta videos.
---
"One jump", there are a lot of jumps in warsong. It's a significant nerf but I overexaggerate lul.
---
More alliance queuing into Warsong at 30 would be great.
---
How would you compare hunters to mages as far as outplay potential?
---
Feelsbad that your joke totally whooshed so many people tbh.
---
But if I use the mouse to turn, how can I click on Rend?
---
15
---
Holds up with what I remember.  It was an extremely rare sight for me (like once a week) to see anyone in any  T3 (and it was pretty much the same few people).  T2 was more common, but still a rare sight.  I remember most level 60s had a hodge podge of dungeon gear with a few random epics (typically from ZG/AQ20) when TBC came out.  Raiders with full T2/T3 were so rare most were known by name and revered on my server.
---
It wasn't until private servers that you could walk into a city and highly complete raiding gear of any kind be a common sight.
---
Streamers are like 1% of the people invited so far, so if some of them lose interest it really doesn't affect the number of available testers much.
---
Only Blizzard knows how many testers they feel they need during their beta.
---
Be tauren
---
you can always use potions to prevent stuns like Free action potion and living action potion (think thats the name) and you also do have your trinket
---
hell you even have an extra stun yourself
---
What an accurate comment.
---
Curious to see if Blizzard will do anything about this. For some reason I remember you had to be just simply sitting to get crit in vanilla. If they changed this for Classic surely they will remove or patch this. Great find.
---
honestly i think this opens up a much bigger discussion... if hitboxes are left the way they are then the larger tauren hitbox might actually be more useful than the stun resist... the reason being is that it will be much harder to "deadzone" a tauren warrior than any other race
---
lvling is slower/harder on classic actually. Mobs out in the world hit harder and have more hp on average on classic compared to private servers. It is the elite trash in dungeons that are dealing higher damage on private servers.
---
*Failed attempt.*
---
Dude, I am going to buy this GPU so I can have #NoChanges to my Vanilla experience.
---
Give me 10 FPS or give me death!
---
Thicc
---
See "How do I Play World of Warcraft Classic?".
---
You'll be able to create characters on August 13 if you have a subscription. So it'll be downloadable then at the latest.
---
I'm kind of worried about that too, so I'll probably go Holy/Disc Priest at first this time around since I was pretty much only playing Resto shaman for most of my WoW playtime, and I had a priest alt that was a lot of fun even when underleveled. 
---
Of course if you really want to be able to burst people down while also healing ele/resto is better, but the mana issues are kind of putting me off.
---
I just want the class balance from TBC. I could live without TBC itself. Would like Classic+ content though!
---
Usually you mention it ahead of time. The group will either say “sorry need it for MS” or “I’ve got better, go for it.” Keep an eye on loot rolls. You can see who “Needs” or “Greeds” an item as well.
---
Chocolate granola. A local store sells it cheaper than even bulk orders online. I just bought the entire shelf a few days ago no exaggeration. I could live off that stuff.
---
Nah, that was the completely broken version haha. The 4 stacks version is still super OP. You can easily one shot other players with it. When repentance was in the prot tree all you really needed out of ret was Seal of Command. You do sword and board and heal people in BGs until you take 4 crits, then weapon swap macro out to a two handed and one shot someone (potentially).
---
Agreed.  Not to mention you could take a raid group into Scholo/Strat/BRS.  The main challenge for end game group content on launch was herding cats.
---
There is only 1 Moonfire in there. See if you can find it.
---
I've seen many a horde graveyard look like that back in the day. I miss running premades, and am looking forward to doing it again in Classic.
---
You need dx11 for the modern client though ;)
---
Are we still pretending Athene's arrogance is an act? Dude runs a *literal cult.* Google it.
---
Annoying to listen to someone vaping into the mic over and over. You don't think that noise would ever get on your nerves?
---
If you know that bugs are still in the game, then the people testing are doing their jobs. 
---
It’s when you see no bugs happenings is when things get bad.
---
If you don't have beta, why not play 1.12. Or are those places tabu here?
---
Warlock or mage would be best. Frost mage would highly beneficial due to the slows and crowd control attached to their damage spells.
---
I don't know, maybe like how Windfury doesn't work properly at all on the beta right now.
---
Plenty of broken stuff has been discovered in the beta. All of you "ree private server" people are really obnoxious.
---
darn evasive flowers
---
I believe most if not all zones (at least as alliance) will have quests that rewards you receipes that uses mats from that zone. So doing those quest and saving all the mats from beasts you kill will be a huge help in keeping cooking skill up.   
---
As a bonus i've often been able to trade cooked food for raw mats by asking in general chat, since not everyone bothers levelling cooking.
---
Did they state whether they consider this "griefing"? or is it only griefing if it is same faction running in and killing themselves to get their raid the kill.
---
ps. not against this, loved these battles back in the day, just wondering for clarification
---
What you're missing about Paladins is that in Vanilla they were a true hybrid support class.  They didn't do any of those specific roles (dps, tanking) well enough to really be viable, but they brought a ton of value to the raid in terms of buffs, heals and support.
---
A paladin played well makes their group better, enough so that they are worth bringing and having around.  That's why vanilla pallies are awesome; they are a true hybrid support that doesn't exist in the current game.  It is ok that they don't do those other things great, because they do what they are meant for very well.
---
So, you cherry picked a couple of examples that fit a conclusion you already had. Rock solid!
---
They officially revealed this tech on many occasions in many different interviews and outlets.  Are you just mad that you learned it from the streamers you follow?  How else is news supposed to circulate.  Should Blizzard mail a letter personally addressed to you?
---
im pretty sure I cant get one anyway lol
---
None of the lvl 30s in my guild have anything more than 2 days offline.  Yes people are making alts but around late afternoon early evening a lot of folks are  on their 30s trying to do something or contribute in some ways.
---
Also as far as I know there aren’t any streamers in my guild.  if they are - they are super low key about it.
---
What an original reply.
---
Show us. Nobody buys it
---
&gt;Because they were abusing it
---
viewers not in beta test. cannot report bugs. Not one person in his group, nor asmond reported the bug when they were done. That statement alone proves he knew he wasn't be sarcastic.  On top of the fact that the moment we are discussing has been edited out of his uploads. because he knows he was fucking wrong. And if it was just sarcasm. Why edit it out? 
---
His past actions on stream have set a precedent that he went against because the bug he was abusing was helping him, as opposed to the other team. I've literally seen him stop in the middle of the battle in WSG to send two bug reports while the fight was still going on. He did this because it was him on the other end of the abuse. telling people to do it after he wins, isn't sarcasm. That's hypocrisy.  How autistic do you have to be to be so far down on his dick that his nuts are blinding you from facts?
---
Being able to link my crafting professions so people can see what I can make.
---
Edit: Looked throught some of this post and didn't see this one yet, Kinda big in my book.
---
Damn how?? I hate Dun Morough cause it’s way too damn big and takes forever to get anywhere
---
Your point is valid, your argument is sound but you're unfortunately incorrect, sir.
---
I have a theory from personal experience on my server in vanilla as to why VC is the legitimate and traditional acronym, not DM.
---
Were you a horde or alliance player in vanilla?
---
I have a feeling that Alliance skews VC and horde skews DM.
---
I actually loved TBC. I'm personally looking forward to play it some day (if possible). I liked it more then vanilla personally. It gave pvp'ers some extra content. (Arena's were also a lot of fun)
---
Its more insidious then even that. We have local small telcom companies in the city of Eau Claire, who cannot even do business in thier home city.
---
Yup, agile little stationary things.
---
What a pointless reply
---
This is OP:  
---
&gt;Don't worry about not being in beta.   
---
&gt;You think you want to play WoW now, but you really don't.
---
NA
---
Artifacts after they made Artifact Knowledge shared was great. I think it is a good system, tho instead of artifacts I would like a more permanent solution like the talent trees of Vanilla-Cata.
---
&gt; At least Soda [...], but he absolutely also has a massive entitlement complex where he expects people to give him what he wants.
---
This is just false and reeks of someone who hasn't actually watched his stream ever.
---
If you and your friends enjoy a challenge, you could handicap yourself to make it more fun.  Take off several slots of gear while still min/maxing the rest.
---
Yep. Mage was my "second love" in vanilla WoW. I started with a Rogue and did great in PvP but man Mage is so versatile and fun I don't even miss stealth.
---
have you heard about this new little known website called "goggles" or something like that? I've heard it's really helpful!
---
Warlock because warlocks have the same problem warriors have: mobility.
---
Warriors get kited hard by mages, warlocks have beefy health because they have problems opening a gap against a warrior and especially against a rogue.
---
Paladins BoFing a lock will negate the only downside warlocks experience.
---
Can't - same error as before. Likely closer to launch it'll be possible
---
Auto loot is an option in the interface without any addons
---
two issues:
---
- trying to tune content to the feelings of nostalgia versus authenticity is a slippery slope, and will ultimately lead to the same bland streamlined experience of current WoW 
---
- retuning WoW Classic will prevent new players from having their first time of WoW experience.
---
Yeah, until they announce they won't be doing a wipe for beta characters so everyone essentially just has a four month head start that got into beta. I think that's gonna be the part that pisses me off about not getting in.
---
Not saying for sure that'll roll over beta characters, but it sure is possible.
---
10, was scared too talk on vent cause I thought they would instantly boot me
---
I'll be honest this is exactly how I got started when I was 4, I'd sit in a chair and watch over my dad's shoulder while he'd do raids or dungeons with his guild, back then everyone was always using ventrillo and I'd talk to all my dad's guild mates who knew I was his son it was honestly such an awesome experience just to even watch so I eventually annoyed him enough for him to let me make my own character (a nelf druid named "Staaxx" which is the name I still use to this day.) It's great to really see that this game really did give people a sense of child like wonder.
---
35.
---
My guild had roster issues so we never had full raids for MC and cleared everything besides Raggy with \~25, maybe 30 if my memory isn't failing me. We only killed Ragnaros once on our first evening trying him when we managed to get everyone online and we were still about 35.
---
Admittedly this was quite late in Vanilla - autumn of 2006 but it's in line with what Classic will bring in terms of number tuning.
---
perfect "vanilla" expierence at 12 fps.
---
A blue post actually detailing how it works would be fine.
---
BUT THAT MINION LOVED THAT FOOD LAST NIGHT!
---
I think that's the problem,  this is not a server to progress on or have any connection to your characters progression.  Ideal testers would be making new characters, different racials, testing experience levels.
---
Is completing dungeons giving the correct amount of XP.  Is grinding mobs etc.
---
12, I remember trying every race but the only one my computer at the time could actually load the zone of was undead
---
Is it realistic to tank as a warrior and cover repair costs while playing 10-15 hours a week? Farming is major concern of mine but I would be playing with a mage also. I'd like to tank for buddies since we'll be really casual but the thought of just messing around with a hunter or warlock is appealing. Druid and paladin really don't interest me at all.
---
You only disagree because the creation of something like this gives you a personal gain. The bigger picture here is that it would result in artificially longer subs than there would have been without it. There WILL be people that unsub no matter how how long you plan on playing Classic. Baiting them to sub for 6 or 12 months for that instant gratification of beta access is manipulative. It has been a long running trend that Blizzard continues to practice (see 2012 annual pass, dreakwake store mount sub promotion). We certainly dont need a beta server bursting at capacity with people that aren't really there to test the game. We know how well that went with the MoP beta.
---
At the end of the day, companies will all continue to try to get the most money possible from their consumers, but we should not openly endorse and encourage these kinds of practices wherever possible.
---
I agree? That’s why I think it’s silly. 
---
Nothing in classic require class stacking except for 4H, where warriors become 20% of your raid.
---
Dude, I'm not the guy you're talking to this whole time but it's really not that hard a concept.
---
Day 1, game releases at 12am, a surge of players log on at the exact same time and stay on grinding heavily for the next week or two.  The stress on servers are always highest at launch because the entire community wants to play at the same exact time.  As time goes on, the concurrent player count lessens, and so does the need for layering.
---
I'm a Shaman main, but Alliance-side (rerolled a Dranei when TBC came out). I'm planning on rolling an Orc Shaman this time around. Haven't played through the horde side of things, nor a vanilla shaman so it will be pretty fresh!
---
Don't worry, it's the same for half the subreddit
---
Same but my dad was their tank so I basically had immunity lmao
---
Based on preliminary results of the survey (which I'll publish when there's a larger sample size) there are a lot of people thinking the same thing. So far Horde outnumbers alliance 2:1
---
Both locks and mages are really good in pvp, but warlocks arguably are more gear dependent. Mages will, in organized pvp, mostly be used for their incredible slow potential through frost spells as well as their great control from sheep and counterspell. Warlocks are also good at controlling through Fear, Howl of Terror and their succubus' charm effect, but they can also be a pain in the ass with their curse of tongues on healers, and spreading dots on the enemy team on top can really pressure their healers.
---
In 1v1, they're also both strong, but mages might have an edge against melee and hunters, especially before you get really good gear on either class. A warlock will eat healers, though, which is something mages will have to work a lot harder for.
---
Personally I hope they bugfix this even as a paladin player its kind of dumb lol
---
Love it, great work!
---
Same with cats
---
where is the "i have no freaking idea" option lol
---
I actually voted for modern, I think classic will end up with a smaller number of players but a larger community.
---
Retail feels like a bunch of players playing the same single player game
---
Melee range gained and warstomp are solid on their own.  The extra health adds up to about 400 hp from PvP stam stacking gear which is a good chunk of extra HP.  But really its the hidden extra melee range which is nice for hitting mages / hunters trying to kite you.  Its pretty hard to get out of melee range with leeway and the extra 3 yards.
---
SSSSSHHHHHWWWWWWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHO
---
Thank you so much for this! Maybe anyone have some similar thing for non classic ingame books?
---
How is resto itemization? Never really healed before but I think I could slog it out if the gear nicely translates to boomkin pvp.
---
What else would you like to know,  How bout Mcconnell and company dodging BGs whenever they match a premade.   Seems like a good testing of warsong right there.  I mentioned the above streamers bc they recently requested access and got it.
---
The elitist mentality will get divided up within the first couple weeks and will remain so until there’s a reconnect at 60.  Even then, I feel there’s a little room to say “really dude?!” Because you’ve had 60 levels to really learn your abilities in depth and experience dungeons and what you shouldn’t be doing by that point.  It won’t clear up the chain puller types of issues, but stuff like having growl off should be rectified.
---
I don’t anticipate much hate from vets though.  In fact, I expect the opposite (myself being one).  I know how hard mobs can hit in certain areas, I know that assisting each other on an orange quest, even if it means waiting for them to drink or grab an herb, will end up being faster in the end.  Eventually, you’ll have to trust 40 other people to know their shit enough to progress so teaching them ahead of time will only help the guild/community/faction/server as a whole.
---
This was the exact opposite for my server. The alliance sucked and we would drag the fights out for hours with all 10 of us on our roof. We could not for the life of us win a bg. AV, which I would come to learn is super Alliance sided, wasn't any better. We would hold the horde at bridge for full days. The horde elemental god would get summoned and killed at bridge every game. I can't remember completely but i believe it would get summoned multiple times per match due to like 4 hour respawn timers or something like that.
---
I wouldn't choose my class based on preraid bis difficulty. Will spend a lot more time raiding than preparing to raid. Choose what class is fun or base it on the raiding meta. 
---
Personally I narrowed to two classes based on what I like to play. Then chose the one I liked the look of more sets on. I'm a big fan of characters looks and set collection :) Never got any full vanilla sets during vanilla, so excited to try and collect them all.
---
How are you able to look through the code? Im really interested in finding out mob health and armor values to compare to private servers.
---
Being a very popular class and only having 2 per raid somewhat scares me lol
---
Its straight up price fixing. I've been to some cities like St Paul, that do not have the same agreements, and the same internet from the same company (Charter Spectrum) is advertised 20% cheaper. The straight up advertise that. "Some deals are not available in all areas"
---
I hear this alot. It seems like a ton of people went horde (undead/tauren) because it was the only zones their computers could load.
---
12.  The first time playing was at my Aunt and Uncles house.  They got everyone hooked on the game.
---
That’s good to know !
---
...because you didn’t get in.
---
Oh it's still there
---
Excuse me OP but did you just assume my gender?
---
Let's not even start on the gorilla furs in STV
---
Well the idea here is what is a bigger threat, Rogues and such stunning you, or harder to be kited by ranged classes?  Do you try to cover your weaknesses more, or capitalize on your strengths?
---
They both have their pros and cons. Warstomp v bloodfury &amp; Melee Range v stun resist.
---
Both have very compelling arguments.
---
On a couple of "black market" type sites people are trying to buy beta accounts for $1200ish....so...yea you aren't alone.
---
As someone playing Retail still, I also only enjoy seeing him get wrecked. He's awful.
---
Theyre pretty profficient at farming herbs/mining, they have entangling roots/hibernate to keep mobs away while they collect
---
The majority of players haven't gotten to 30 yet. Once a sufficient percentage of the population have I'm sure they'll raise the cap.
---
I honestly think a lot of the shit talking is coming from people who didn't play vanilla and are trying to 'show off' knowledge about it by parroting stuff theyve heard.
---
Cool post thanks for sharing
---
144hz if you dont have one. 1080p @ 144hz is fine but 1440p @ 144hz is the way to go if you are willing to spend more
---
I mean, its only been a week since the last one.  Who changes their pants that often?
---
Right now the pop between lvl5 to lvl20 is insane. Definitely that pre-classic hype
---
I forgot about shard farming, could always do it while farming for gold so it doesn’t sound too bad
---
he already is? you're obviously the normie here OMEGALUL
---
If blizzard says its correct, its correct.
---
I’m leveling boomkin and there’s nothing you can do to stop me
---
That sounds incredible lol
---
By the time i got my warrior boots on it was already my third char to go up to 60 , so my transition to tanking was rather smooth as ive already known ins and outs of tanking. I was also lucky to have leveled up my warr around the time AQ came out so i was mainly pvping or beeing OT trough some of the raids as arms getting all the tank stuff no one wanted for free and using dkp for the important pvp items !
---
different
---
They can solo Mara. They can also farm the lashers in Dire Maul
---
don't think you even need to fd tbh, the hunters pet is too strong haha
---
You're not wrong, but running over fields sounds better in my head than hugging mountains and cliffs. But either way, its as you say basically the same :)
---
That's irrelevant, there could be other broken things. Half of the abilities aren't even accessible yet. You're acting as if there are no bugs on the beta to be discovered and anyone with any concerns about the accuracy of the launch are just private server morons.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
I love that classic song "Rum and Vanilla Coca-cola" by the Andrew Sisters
---
I’m pretty sure I want to play Hunter in classic; however I read that they are worse in DPS than all other DPS classes(mage, rogue, lock). Are they so bad that people don’t want them in raids? (Except from the tranq shot hunter)
---
They *can* solo mara, not sure how spec dependent that is though, I haven't tried it myself. But that right there can get you decent g/hr. 
---
Plus there's always the other ways of making gold, that aren't super reliant on clear speeds and soloing dungeons, so any class is honestly fine at making gold unless you are trying to be a gold seller or buy ridiculously expensive vanity/twink items frequently.
---
Well as Asmoglod puts it, "get your family addicted so that way they won't be asking you to get off during a raid, they'll be asking you if they have a spot"
---
The gender of my characters have never once affected my ability to get into the roleplay of any RPG. Be it WoW, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, etc.
---
I think it's inaccurate to conflate matching your character's gender to your own as being "more into the RPG thing." It certainly can help people get into their character, but shouldn't be implied that it's a sign of stronger roleplay, baseline.
---
Melee range is so op in PvP, but its a double edged sword against other melee
---
I got mad jealous of people getting beta I rolled on a pserver. It is a huge fight with myself to not play 4 hours a day. I force myself to only play maybe 30 min every other day so I don't burn myself out. I just want a feel for classes.
---
12.
---
Sorry to hear.
---
Hey whats up, I'm gonna be a delusional feral
---
the updated talents hardly matter in level 20-30 dungeons where you have only a few talents points anyway.
---
End of 2008
---
I was also, you know, like 4, so I guess they thought I was cute idk
---
20 going on 21
---
Between Diablo 2 and WoW it was definitely the best gaming experience(s) of my life. Good times.
---
The current retail character models (+ animations if you consider that part of the overall "new character style" feature). The old ones are okay-ish, though wildly varying in quality. I really like the newer ones.
---
Mercifully I can't handle watching him too much, but I've seen enough to know what he is. 
---
Between the gurubashi shit and the warglaive meltdown years ago, I don't know why people get so invested in these guys and go to bat for them.
---
I fail to see what difference that makes? Are there less world buffs available in the early phases? Sure. Can you stack any world buff available though? Yes you can.
---
Even without any world buffs it's hard to argue early content like MC and BWL will be difficult.
---
I would agree with that logic if Blizzard hadn't gone out of their way to change their plan from "starter zones at launch" to "before Phase 2 starts".
---
Phase 2 could be 6 months from now.  It it was just at launch id be fine with it.  Several months, no thanks.
---
Yep, otherwise it would be so OP. Imagine if taurens could hamstring another warrior or rogue and literally keep them kited and not be able to hit back.
---
Everyone would be a tauren hunter/warrior.
---
Doesnt help when youre in a server group that has a lot of people that dont even speak your language.  I have a deep loathing of BR servers from my time playing Horde :/
---
Was it the pants or manbaby part that triggered the existential gender crisis?
---
Well that’s good, never really was one for causing trouble. (Although... dropping an infernal in a lowbie zone does sound appealing.)
---
No one knows. Imbalances are unavoidable.
---
25, dominated my life until for a while, made some great friends along the way, some I still play games with.
---
can duo DM(whatever section has the cave w/  rich thorium @ end) with a tank / Lasher farming/ Mara solos.
---
I would love to see new content with the "classic" feeling. I don't want blizzard follow the same path.. TBC, WTLK etc... Maybe with classic wow we can have a parallel universe? :P New stories, new ideas..
---
Thanks, I think you understand my point of this post. which is refreshing
---
Easy peasy man. the 1.12 dungeon gear is on par with plenty of t1 stuff. People are so much better at the game, DBM is a thing, people are rocking 35MS, instead of 200.
---
Did you just assume I have a gender?
---
I recall ret paladins wielding one handers and shields and tanking everything up until Mauradon / Dire Maul, and the same with shaman horde side. especially if you overleveled a dungeon by 1-3 levels. 
---
this is always the ways its been. yes we were better balanced at by patch 1.12 but that's a feature not a bug.
---
What do the columns translate to?
---
Here's the animation:
---
https://youtu.be/M0XG-r-jZkk
---
Paladins have some undead spots to themselves, and are pretty good aoe farming, but the gear requirement from what I have seen is pretty high for a fresh 60 (reflective disk/skullflame shield, a good shield spike, and decent tankiness).
---
The difficulty of the content really depends on how far the game is progressed. Right when BWL comes out, casuals probably won't be diving in immediately and clearing it week 1 or 2, but some of my friends' more chill guilds did all of BWL/ZG/AQ20 with 9 hours a week of raiding and a really moderate out-of-raid schedule, and there are even guilds with 6 hour raid weeks. Supposedly this server is even higher tuned as well. 
---
If MC is all you're worried about, that's even easier, and even the most relaxed, chilled out guilds with low time commitment will be able to get MC on lockdown once they have a group together. Exceptional guilds clear MC in like 30 minutes once they're geared and the consumables grind doesn't really exist yet outside of a few things for important roles, and my second-to-last character I could barely play 15 hours a week, even less some weeks, in a casual guild. Probably 75% of our raid was brand new to the content and on similar schedules, and we did MC before BWL was out, and BWL before AQ was out, and the environment was great.
---
Basically, if you just keep playing and stick with it, you can definitely do all of the raids except AQ40/Naxx on a super relaxed schedule. I mean, you're still gonna be playing a pretty fair bit of WoW, but you can totally make your T2+ dreams come alive with 10-20 hours a week, it just won't be right when the content comes out.
---
Even AQ40/Naxx won't require a true "70 hours of WoW per week" experience in these days, but the bump-up in consumables and resist gear required is definitely there, and is a real constraint.
---
When I leveled a feral druid I didn't have trouble picking up off-spec healing gear unless there was another druid in the group. Shamans will be wearing mail and priests can't wear leather so any leather with healer stats will generally come your way.
---
It might be hard to get BiS stuff but you just need enough to get through 1 raid - then the Cenarion gear will rain from the sky if its anything like vanilla
---
Do we know if Twitch App will have all the addons for classic like retail or do we need to hand doanload everything like in the old days :D
---
I had this wallpaper for a while.
---
"**4.4. Don't share how to cheat**
---
Do not share or encourage the use of exploits, cheats, private servers, or other illicit game behaviour." 
---
But eh, a lot seems to figure it out. After all any decently sized 1.12 feel like fresh.
---
When did they patch them out. Was just watching soda do them two days ago. Really hope they only took ones out that put you somewhere you can't be attacked. Stuff like that is part of what makes classic amazing.
---
again don't care about access, I want a properly tested Beta.  Lets not wait til Aug 27th to realize no one tested X interaction, testers were too busy working on lvl 30 BiS
---
I have 3. I spent so much money consolidating WoW accounts characters....
---
18 Left for the army right after launch. Came back for some glory later on.
---
Nice character mate! Yeah you can play it but with all the new spells / heirlooms etc it would be pointless unfortunately :(
---
Fun fact on very low pop PVE servers there may not even be a rank 14 in a given week if there arn't enough players :)
---
i thought it was the pet fix and was wondering how the fuck did they fixed it in beta classic and not in bfa :P
---
Shamans also gained some stuff, I can't remember if it was stormstrike or something else but I don't recall any class at all giving my shaman problems. Everyone was basically cloth/leather to me
---
Honestly you don't need hundreds, just enough to get rolling, and make sure you create more off of trash mobs and you'll be fine. 
---
Stuff gets trickier in BWL when the first 2 bosses have 0 trash.
---
As far as I know you could just straight up sit in early Vanilla to trigger crit reactive procs, but it got patched out  around 1.9.
---
The currently implemented version of sitbatching DID however exist for all of Vanilla.

Unfortunately my dad had a real problem with the game taking over his life and it caused a lot of issues but thankfully he stopped playing and became a little more self aware as to what was going on and everything is a lot better now, he still refuses to go anywhere near classic WoW though which, while understandable, is unfortunate. I was really looking forward to running raids with my dad since I was to young back when he played
---
There has been an imbalance for 15 years now depending on realms, there are only a handful of realms with a perfect 50/50 balance.
---
The thing is this wouldn't really matter in retail, classic however... world PvP is everything.
---
45 gold in ya pockets   
---
Confirmed , true vanilla raider.
---
you cant break a pally, they are far to durable
---
You seem to think streamers are the bulk of the tester playing. Even if you count Bob who has 47 followers and has peaked at 12 viewers they still are in the minority. 
---
There are plenty of beta testers, at least compared to any other game in beta.
---
feels bad mate, same here! Would love to go through all the screenshots I'd taken from vanilla/tbc
---
Ah did blizzard actually remove them? I wondered whether I sold or lost mine by mistake!
---
And there was another mage called Noone, but im not sure if he had any Vanilla movies. I just remember the tbc vids he did
---
Just gotta check if anyone knows, is there an addon like the one this guy has that adds the top bar like that? With gold and fps and stuff?
---
You can probably do mc and deff onyxia, but vaelstras in bwl will shut you down quickly with only 20 people
---
if you give a mouse a cookie.....
---
It's not actually a bug.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuPEzEoexLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuPEzEoexLI)
---
Its bugged in that the animation plays and the damage is registered but only 1 of the 3 hits shows up as floating combat text.
---
This has nothing to do with lag. It has to do with their implementation of a new mechanic POST Cataclysm that allows a player to gain range when they are moving. 
---
It's still in the client because they were using a legion/bfa client which at the core of it's code included that. This kind of 'leeway' is completely non Vanilla-WOTLK. 
---
Checkout my post to get a understanding from both perspectives many examples included. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs7ks2/melee_leeway_retail_mechanic_in_classic/
---
Honestly, you should also consider a hunter. Warrior and rogue are off the table due to the amount of commitment it takes to succeed in pvp. Mages are great and not too gear reliant but their skill floor is a lot higher than hunters, but their ceiling is also higher. 
---
Hunters own world pvp and are really great for BGs as well. Plus, easiest class to level and doesn't take a lot of time commitment.
---
Great question, probably not to be honest. Like you said I do not want to burn my self out just to burn my self out again, which I will do. Id rather relive classic with my new/old buddies again.
---
You'll be competitive in phase 1 (onyxia, molten core) but you will start to drop down the meters as people pick up BWL gear, and further still into AQ40 and beyond.  That said you still bring utility in raids with tranq shot, along with the relatively niche roll of 'raid puller', scouting ahead with aspect of the cheetah to keep the raid ticking along with things to slap.  I recall typically raiding with 2 hunters throughout vanilla.
---
Factor in raiding will not be what you spend the majority of your time doing in WoW:Classic.  Hunters are one of the best classes for solo farming and general solo content, plus a perfectly viable option for pvp that doesn't require a healbot to be relevant.
---
So back in vanilla I played a gnome rogue pretty hardcore, got up to lieutenant commander and OG naxx up to 4h. Now that I know my way around optimization I realize human is an all around better race for rogues, but I want to relive my original experience, should I give a shit?
---
At least they require less healing than mage tanks and rogue tanks. Their players can help heal them and no one else in the party usually cares if it dies. 
---
My ptsd is triggered by warlocks who wait until you are drinking to start spamming life tap. Be more helpful if they smack LT a few times right as the mob hits the ground. Then I can toss a flash heal and HoT and start drinking.
---
Everything is per character. Have one main, respec for pvp or pve, have 2 sets of gear.
---
The idea of having 2 of the same class is pretty ridiculous, but fair play if you want to I guess.
---
This sub: all the caving to fans ruined WoW  
---
Also this sub: Let me tell you how to make WoW better
---
This way of triggering procs was in fact part of Vanilla up until TBC so removing it would be a change.
---
Waaaah. I'm entitled. Waaah
---
I mean after the second reply from him you could have let it go, it was obvious then if not from the initial comment that he was being sarcastic.. 
---
Also just a bit r/iamverysmart lmao
---
Or who were kids and had parents who didn't want to fork over $15 a month for "some stupid game"
---
He has a video of Fury Warrior Tank, but where is the Furry Warrior Tank (bearform)?
---
Ok ive been looking all over for Population numbers.  Only thing ive Found is a rough estimate by Tipsout who claims there are ~1000 players on the beta realm. (alliance + horde)  As far as I know , the game is aiming for a 3k-5k population per realm...
---
truuuuuuuuuuu
---
You have to pay to rank up your spells after re speccing as well, not just the respec cost.
---
On pserver where it's purple it doesnt obey master loot due to being a quest item. Can be looted by anyone on that quest.
---
Thank you for your service. ^-^ that sounds really similar to a lot of my cousins that went in around that time (my generation is reeeeally spread out age wise) it was a lot of fun to play with them whenever they came home on leave.
---
Exactly, which is why you get imbalanced servers. Once a server starts getting a leaning one way or the other, people on the other side jump ship and people from the dominating side start flocking there because it's going to have the most competitive PvP/PvE guilds since they've got the most people to pull from.
---
It's unavoidable, and why blizz is doing cross realm BGs.
---
They want an authentic world but to be one of the few who are so researched it's almost cheating. Not everyone can be Kirito.
---
i never said i played vanilla, you are retarded
---
except if i wanted to i could usually do them all in 2  long days a week, instead of having to log on every day of the week. The only things i farmed in my raiding guild in vanilla was tubers and some potions.
---
&gt; Ending a fight with just 2% of your health left and knowing that if you'd picked any other race you'd be running back to your corpse right now.
---
Or, or. Get this. You don't even get to 2% or 5% because you have axe specialization and blood fury so you do way more damage and kill the mob faster.
---
Who is dat Indio on the right bottom corner?
---
Nothing carries over between characters, leveling a second one would come with all the trials and tribulations you'd expect from the first. I personally would not roll two variants of the same character, would instead invest the time into a second class that I'd like to play
---
Do you have a video on how to do that? I've never seen a druid do a solo dm tribute run and I'm not even sure how'd theyd get past the door you seaforium
---
Yes. I don’t get it, I really don’t
---
Hi, /u/Strobber7
---
didnt read post , thank you for the insight.  *do not want a beta code.
---
Absolutely amazing work man, thanks for doing all the hard work for the rest of us! :)
---
&gt; Do both characters need to buy licenses and mounts (or do mount quests)?
---
Yes they do. Virtually nothing in Vanilla/Classic is shared on the account.
---
though i have watched hundreds of vanilla videos, studying damage values and everything is correct on classic beta
---
I'm pretty much talking about all dungeons and raids. Same thing applies for all of them, but yes much less so for the earlier ones.
---
There are some glaring differences though. Mages used to have a casttime on arcane explosion for example and you had to talent it down to instant, something you didn't do until max level. Now mages have instant aoe from the get go. I'm sure there are more things that actually matter a little bit in dungeons at the lower levels too.
---
Their dps isn't as bad people say, they don't scale as hard as other dps classes for sure but their dps rotations were a tad bit more complicated for the average hunter player back in vanilla, as such their dps was abysmally lower than it should've been.
---
I've seen some really good hunters do insane dps in raids,besides hunters are always needed for anything that involves pulling , kiting or bypassing packs and ofc tranq shotting, so I wouldn't worry about it too much either way, just play what you enjoy.
---
Fotm picking isn't a thing in vanilla.
---
This is probably over-budget and I'm not really recommending it per se, but in terms of required grunt: I've been playing the beta with no issues on a 2018 macbook air which is pretty lightweight in terms of number-crunching or pixel-pushing. So a new laptop with a reasonable intel/amd processor and integrated graphics should do fine. Anything with a dedicated chip should be even better.
---
Duo running diremaul with a miner is gonna be your best bet most likely
---
As far as respecs go, think about the time it would take you to level a character to 60 and gear them for pvp so you don't have to respec.  Lets say you are a little faster than average and do it in 6 days played.  Thats 144 hours.  How long to gear up that toon?  Lets say another day played?  So we are at 168 hours.  If you can grind 50g per hour thats 168 respecs you could have earned in gold in that time.  If you respec twice a week its 84 weeks of resets.
---
Is that worth?
---
They both have really high amounts of outplay potential, I can't definitively say one way or the other which has more. I think mage is a bit safer because of the CD reset they have + polymorph and evocation when fighting 1vX. If you go OOM as a hunter when 1vX you're cooked because you can't kite without mana, but I'm sure mages are envious of several hunter features too so it might be a wash.
---
And then you find a cool looking cave only to have the most beastly gorilla come at you... Can't remember his name though.
---
Ofc you would have to do everything again, how do you think this works?
---
Of course it's economically better to just respec.
---
What about the thousands of other people in the beta that you don't see playing? What are you assuming they're doing? 
---
Your perspective on this is obscenely narrow and it's doing you no favors.
---
take note of your %phys mitigation at your current level, keep your armor value the exact same until you level up and then look at your %phys mitigation again
---
it's going to be a few % lower, because at that level you just achieved, your character needs more armor to retain that %phys mitigation
---
the same is true for your crit, dodge, parry, etc
---
OSRS is doing great. Older game models can survive in current climates. People haven’t changed _that_ much.
---
I always try to get my point across clearly/detailed, and I type fast. Skill/performance in any area is a complex matter, you can't boil it down to watching some guy play poorly and then assume he is trash, at least not when he has proof he's been moderately successful.
---
Appologies for the long posts.
---
My favorite part of this is your guildie asking if the bouquet of black Roses looks pretty
---
I disagree, I played braindead and had a blast, although I never hit cap until BC, my biggest accomplishment was exploring every single zone (exploration tabard achievement now) as soon as i got my level 40 mount, pretty much as soon as I hit tanaris I hit a lot of road bumps and basically ran into a wall in leveling.
---
What is a “standard” pvp druid build? Mostly for premades
---
Sure, I’m familiar with the server in question and it was totally seeing at least 8-10k peak a few months ago too, so you’re right.
---
I just wanted to contribute my own anecdotal experience. Seems like we’re in agreement.
---
My husband and I are going to be taking our time because we'll have a newborn along with our two other kids soon. With that being said, we aren't rushing leveling and will be RPing most of the way.
---
He will be maining a warrior and I am... Torn between priest and hpal. I was leaning towards priest because of the T3, which I know is ultimate endgame, and because of Benediction. I also main a priest now and have always just liked the class. Also, wanding is great. &gt;:D However, hpal seems to synergize best with warrior, since no bubble to screw with them, we'll be pvping a lot, and I like the playstyle of hpal a lot. Simple but can be strong. And the fact they can equip all non tier items is great for RPing as well.
---
Just seriously torn between the two. x.x
---
What's a Tibia?
---
I just don’t see the downside, especially the second time through. Anyone who chooses to play knows what is coming=Bc attunements. 
---
If you choose to play ctbc, then I expect you’re in for the long haul, you’re there to play for 2 years. If that’s the case, you should really have a core of 20 or so guys who make nearly every raid. And again, it’s not like live where time keeps going and people raid longer than they enjoy the content to play with friends, if you come to ctbc (or classic raiding) and are flakey...why? You choose to sign up, you knew exactly what this game was going to be. So it shouldn’t be hard to retain your fringe 5-8 people for 2 tiers at a time. 
---
I totally see it as a possible problem. Blizzard also solved it by removing the attunements after a certain amount of time so that those who wanted to enjoy to process could. So I suppose I’d just want it progressive like classic. Attunements were massive BC. Intent removing them would be a disservice to the legacy of Classic zburning Crusade.
---
Good take.
---
wow...thats amazing. I had no idea mods were even out already, let alone so many of them.
---
I, for one, do not discriminate when it comes to low-poly digital booty
---
tbh it reminded me of an aquatic themed curtain i had years ago... bright but not overbearing.   it was somehow comforting to me.
---
strong coverup is strong.....
---
oh how the story changes
---
Yea. And if a server is just too high total population, requiring a current player on that realm to send an invite (for friends and people joining guild) so that rando's dont just add to the overpopulation.
---
This was changed towards the end of vanilla I believe. I may be wrong it might have been TBC but I don’t think you have to retrain talented abilities in 1.12.
---
How can up give up screaming ARCANITE REAPER HOOOOO everytime you craft one?
---
&gt; 1] Do you guys prefer to have a character with a race, equipment and talents for pvp and another with a race, equipment and talents for pve, both with the same class?
---
Dude you know it takes like 250 hours to hit 60 right? And then raiding/gearing is a shit ton of time on top of that. If im gonna level an alt I'm 100% not leveling and gearing the same class lol
---
„Youtube“ „druid dm tribute solo“ dude it‘s literally less work than your reply xD
---
Seaforium is needed, or blacksmithing
---
Yup. Nestled away in blasted lands.
---
Ok my bad. I tried lol
---
Haha, this is why I'm remaking my vanilla warrior as he was - bald as the day he was created and a nice 5 o'clock shadow. No regrets there.
---
Just farm gold dude
---
He called out for people to talk about the stress test on Monday. Just be in the discord and you might see the call out :)
---
Back in real vanilla, I did this. I also had much more time. I had:
---
60 human rogue
---
58 human paladin
---
60 tauren shaman
---
60 troll warrior
---
60 human warlock
---
60 undead warlock
---
All but shaman and pally got epic riding.
---
I used my human warlock for raiding. Undead warlock was for pvp. 
---
Troll warrior was for pvp.
---
Shaman was for pvp.
---
Both of my pvp characters got epic riding from pvp rank mounts.
---
Also stress test, they need to make sure their server infrastructure can handle the unwashed masses.
---
One of the oldest mmos. Came out in like 1997.
---
What does seasons do when it comes to making a game boring in those games though? 
---
Diablo is the only one I can that really affects your character, and even that doesn't have to be played with seasons like some of the others.
---
The list of games without seasons massively outweighs the games with seasons.
---
You mean to tell me Private servers are wrong and didn't know how actual vanilla was!? I'm baffled.
---
3 works on its own. They really ramped up the story and production values, and it’s set a good few years after the previous game. If you ever played WoW the plot will be easy to follow.
---
I actually wouldn’t recommend playing the first 2, they’re just too old and lacking any of the comforts of more modern RTS - 3 is genre-defining in this regard.
---
Do they work as good as stims tho?
---
The infamous potato check, BFD had one as well
---
I binged goggles to find about this website. I get less results for goggles on the first page than for something called google. This google must be really popular or have really good seo game. Perhaps they'll make it big someday.
---
Yes, that's why I should be invited xD
---
There were better free games at the time too.
---
10-15 hours a week is quite a bit I'd say and not that casual.  Take what you read on here about the insane consumables required for Classic raiding with a healthy pinch of salt.  Things are not what they were...you could clear everything up to and including AQ40 with little or no consumes, therefore easily doable with &lt;15 hours a week.  Consumables are super important on a tank more for threat generation than survivability, so if you don't have the time to farm these then you might struggle to hold down a main tanking role in a more serious progression guild (whatever that will even look like in Classic...).
---
Naxx is another ballgame, but again, the obscene consumable lists you see are more for smoothing out the rough edges of what is a very unforgiving raid.  It is *doable* with less, just harder.
---
If you're talking about open world or 5man content you can tank all that fine as a dps spec, just in defensive stance and swapping to a shield for the bosses.  Making gold shouldn't be too hard if you have some friends you can regularly run 5mans like DM or Strat:live with.
---
Played from about 2005 until 2010... mostly Horde on Kalecgos. Good times.
---
Wonder if I'll run into any old guildmates that have been long lost since.
---
14, had just started high school and let me tell you, it was a rough freshman year grade wise.
---
It's so amazing to look at a screenshot like this so many years later and still remember so many player/guild names... the AD community really was awesome.
---
[As seen here](https://imgur.com/a/O1J0hZB). However, you don't have to buy them all during leveling. At least 1/4 can be skipped. I heard the epic mount is cheaper too, tho, especially if you group up in a specific part. That alone makes up for the difference.
---
Please name 1
---
Every guild will probably have one or two dagger rogues since there won’t be enough swords to go around, especially with the amount of fury warriors guilds will have.
---
I would just go gnome and focus on daggers since sword spec doesn’t matter for dagger rogues.
---
"the pack"? There will be tons of people at all leveling speeds. In my opinion i see playing classic just to race to 60 as fast as possible a waste. I'm looking forward to revisiting the quests, zones, and skirmishes that made classic so great. If you're gonna have more fun as a warrior then don't sell yourself short because you are *not* missing out on anything by not being the first wave of die hards getting to 60.
---
Then people would avoid that realm. For example, I physically can not level an ally toon. And that's because of two reasons. The first is that I found the leveling experience to be less engaging on the ally side than the horde side and hasn't changed no matter the xpac or how many times I try it. The second is that the Alliance has gnomes. I hate gnomes. Anyways, the point is that if blizz were to tell me I couldn't make a horde toon because of faction balance, I would either go to a different realm or wait until it was balanced so I could make my hordie. Tbh, I would probably go to a realm with more allies. That way I would have more things to hit...
---
Relax. We’re all paying customers. Nobody wants to be outnumbered 3 to 1 and stuck with no realm transfers
---
The real question, would you sub for six months to get Floaty McBoaty mount? /s
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH YOU ARE SO STUPID, I ALREADY EXPLAINED IT, THE % PHYS MITIGATION GOES DOWN BECAUSE BEFORE LEVELING UP IT SHOWS YOU DAMAGE REDUCTION AGAINST LEVEL 25 ENEMIES AND AFTER LEVELING UP TO 26 NOW IT SHOWS YOU DAMAGE REDUCTION AGAINST LEVEL 26 ENEMIES.
---
He made a joke, I commented on it, he commented on it, SOMEONE ELSE commented, he commented with "jeez rly dude?" and I thought I'd show some courtesy by telling him how he had it coming and can avoid it in the future - no hard feelings.
---
There is nothing iamverysmart about this and I am offended by you suggesting it is. I didn't push the issue after my original post, I merely replied to his apparent confusion about nobody understanding his sarcasm, because whenever I say something reddit doesn't like and me not understanding what the fuck is wrong with the post I fucking detest when none of the downvoting assholes makes an effort to explain what about my input is so bad that everyone feels the need to downvote. It's my take on not being the kind of asshole I dislike. And again I find it pretty insulting that you suggest that this is some sort of pseudo intellectual showboating.
---
LMAO
---
I voted modern. Everyone here is pumped for Classic and I would guess that most of us are unhappy with the current state of Retail. But we do need to acknowledge that a lot of people are happy with Retail. It caters well to several particular types of player. And it does seem that those players outnumber us by a comfortable margin. Expect to see Retail to become even more Farmville-like.
---
Plus we really do not know yet, and likely won't for at least a year, what direction Blizzard are going to follow with Classic. There's at least three options and Blizz could choose any or all of them.
---
You don't need BiS slot to raid.
---
I'm gonna have to disagree with you here. I've played so many MMO's over the course of my life, and Runescape is probably one of the best ones ever made.
---
Most MMORPGs are entirely centered around combat, and any crafting systems are just supplemental to aid you in combat. Runescape has many, many other things to do that are completely noncombat related. You can avoid combat entirely and be a "skiller", which is my favorite way to play it.
---
Most MMORPGs have quests that amount to "collect 5 bear asses". Runescape quests are actually in depth and interesting, anything from solving a murder mystery, to building a boat to go to a far off island and slay a dragon. Runescape gets what the word "quest" means - a real adventure, not some trivial errand or task.
---
If you’re a warrior you usually will still want to wear the raging berserker helm over the barbute when not tanking dungeons
---
It's a piece of software, of course there a bugs. That's never going to change, there were bugs in the Apollo 11 software, thousands of people have died to bugs and "features" of airplane software, it's literally impossible to make a program as complex as WoW have no bugs before the Sun swallows the Earth. 
---
The question is what's least profitable: Having more people in the beta, more levels in the beta, or more bugs after launch. 
---
From what I've seen, the game is already in a state where the remaining bugs are unlikely to reduce profitability significantly.
---
https://youtu.be/1b1lCiu62JA you baited me right?

I played a human mage in vanilla, never actually raided though. Gnomes have that nice int buff racial which could be useful if you're trying to be as competitive as possible in high end raiding. Escape artist might be nice for pvp, but in my experience I wasn't getting snared that often. On the other hand the bonus to rep gain for humans is nice if you plan on doing a lot of rep grinding. 
---
I think warlocks are rare and desired enough in both raids and dungeons that you can just choose what you personally like. I went human because like you said the gear looks better and I didn't want to spend 1000+ hours being a little bitch gnome.
---
Will the slight increase in class strength be worth the cost of reliving the experience you want? I LOVE Org as a city but am going to roll a human mage because I want my experience to be as new as possible. Play what you enjoy

Shitty Moonkin Druid in Vanilla. Rerolling Gnome Warlock.

My post doesn't fit any of the categories in rule 7. I call BS.
---
This community is DOA Aug 27th, keep this in mind.
---
the argument comes from the 'bring the player not the class' mentality that was adopted after BC. BC was actually the peak of diversity, IMO, with different classes/specs bringing different buffs and  debuffs. the group compositions in your raid dont matter anymore on retail. in classic, you want a shaman in a group with your rogues/dps warriors for windury, any feral druid in a group with your hunters or melee for leader of the pack. shadowpriest+shaman+lock in a group with your 2 primary tanks.
---
when building a 5 man group for stratholm or whatever endgame blue dungeon you wanted to do, if you have 3 party members, (for example, lets say you have a feral(tank)druid, rogue, priest), you want to pick 2 other classes to fill your group up to synergize with your other members (so in the example, an enhance shaman and maybe a fury or arms warrior -- all your dps would then benefit from leader of the pack and windfury. rogue could apply armor debuff for the warrior)
---
current retail wow, the game has devolved(evolved? idk) into "post your gearscore. the number is too low, you cant come with us on this dungeon"
---
We don’t have to stop you, because you’ll stop to drink every 30 seconds.

I love horror movies but just can’t handle games like that. I bowed out of Amnesia after an hour. I just don’t want to take another step.

This was fixed by 1.12 according to some old forum thread and - move importantly - to [the official not-a-bug list](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887).
---
I’ve been subbed since 2006. Feels like I’ve earned beta. But alas, I have not.
---
a big part of hunter rotation in vanilla was fitting aimed shots in so as not to conflict with auto. it was also part of why ceratin weapon speeds were desirable. not just a slow weapon.  a superfast weapon might work because it would only clip 2 autos, whereas something slightly slower  might clip 3.
---
No it's not because leeway doesn't exist on pservers it's because the mechanics is a POST Cata Mechanic.
---
This would be literally the worst... So say you are playing Horde and the Horde out weigh the Alliance 65/35 so Horde character creation is shut off, but one of your friends just started playing and wants to play with you.  Well now your friend can't start a character on your server and you don't want to start over on your fully geared level 60 on a different server, so now your friend instead of playing jus quits.  Sure you could pay 25 bucks for a server transfer, but then you leave everything you've worked for behind.   
---
Imbalances happen. They're unavoidable and you can't really mitigate them with these type of options. You could given incentives for new players to roll on that realm, on that faction, but then you'd be giving other people advantages in the game and that doesn't seem right in the vanilla ways of life either.
---
I want to say these were all fixed at some point in vanilla.
---
I think Kazzak no longer healed anyone killed that didnt have him tagged much like Emeriss didn't spawn mushrooms on those killed during the fight that didn't have her tagged.
---
I leveled a human ro*U*ge to level 13 and honestly I melt faces but I'm still uncertain if I should continue. I'm going to be maining Horde in retail Classic so I wont really spoil myself too much, but there's just this odd feeling of wanting to play so much but I don't really want to do it.
---
But last night, I afk'ed in Westfall for literally 20 seconds and during that time I was amazed at how many people ran across the town to the big tower and then onwards to the fields. It was a literal unending stream of adventurers. The game actually felt *alive*.
---
I don't think I've seen so many unique players clustered at one spot in any retail WoW zone ever...

I just hope Classic will be this populated.

It's some pointless gate keeping nonsense. Damn this sub is worse than 2007scape already

Those people are out there in retail, too. 
---
A month ago I was doing Freehold+12 (5 man, mythic+ dungeon). Everything was going smoothly and no one had said a word until the second to last boss. I followed the typical "standard" strategy for this boss at this difficulty level (stack and move as a group), but the tank (who had never completed this difficulty by the way) didn't like it and proceeded to intentionally wipe us, berate me for a few minutes for "being a retard", then leave the group (which ends the run).
---
There won't be more of these people (as a percentage), but Classic will give them more opportunities to show themselves (more intense as you say).
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346

Thats the official release schedule. We dont know how long each phase will be yet, but if it is supposed to somewhat mirror the vanilla timeline, we can expect roughly 4 months between phases.
---
Don't worry, I'm a new player and I'm definitely going to be making most if not all of these mistakes, and more, to ensure you veterans get that authentic Vanilla experience. :)
---
Back in 2005 there was no need for a starter pack since we played for like 4h the first day. The game wasn’t really a big thing yet and no need to rush to max level. We didn’t even know what the endgame was.
---
Except Kungen of course.
---
Consumers like you are why we have microtransactions, day 1 dlc, etc. 'It's a cool thing that I want this one time, I also haven't given a single thought of how this could be abused down the road'
---
Burning Crusade had a lot of re-used armor models in dungeons/quest rewards pre-raid content. Between everything there, the Dungeon set 2 gear, and the original dungeon set gear, you get multiple "recolor" sets. I don't think they'll be available in classic.
---
You can play for free til level 20. It'd give you an idea of how things are.

Probably shoulda called it a day after your first comment

This is simply incorrect, checkout my to get a full understanding

Well clearly there are not Thousands of people playing, Ive heard ~1200 are playing on the beta realm  at peak hour.

Lol there’s no context even. How far in the future are we talking? Describe “main branch”.  
---
Take your downvote OP
---
Just communicate your intentions ahead of time. Most groups won’t care because they’re desperate for a tank. If they do care, then just find another group because everyone will want a tank.

Y'know, I had a max lvl warrior in both vanilla and TBC and never did any of that after I finished levelling. In my mind tanking (and PvP) is just more fun.

Omg someone gate keeped me!

I predict it'll start off bad. Once players realize that they actually have a reputation to maintain, they'll start acting better though
---
Nah man. He was trolling like 80% of the time.
---
The dungeon set bl7es ("T0") were needed to start raiding, and had a huuuuge questline to get them. Once you have all 8 pieces of your class' respective set, the next leg of your journey will begin. This will unlock your armor's "true potential", which results in a recolor. Warriors for example, go from grey and gold to blue and gold. Having a completely unlocked set is a major status symbol, and should be praised, as it takes a very long time to get.
---
One of the reasons I am not participating in the Beta is because of the eventual wipe, as one of the things I am looking forward to in Classic is the fact that it is dedicated to a specific release. One of my gripes with Retail WoW and its clones are the constant flow of new levels and tiers of gear. In Classic WoW, this won't be a thing; everything will retain its value, and your hard work will amount to something everlasting.
---
You don't start at 60. You'll have plenty of time to learn as you go through the dungeons leveling. If you've played MMOs for 15 years you'll be just fine bro.
---
The literal exact same thing can (and was) said for WoW at vanilla release.
---
&gt; we're currently blowing past the private server ret build
---
What? Spelladin has been around on private servers for a few years now...
---
You aren’t wrong though and I may be wrong. I know it was changed in wow’s life don’t know when. It may not have happened until mid TBC. I am just not gonna go rummaging through patch notes right now to verify. At one point you did have to.
---
Edit: kinda ties into the memories of vanilla being off or different. Everyone has different timeframes they played and blizzard is trying to recreate a patch that didn’t last long.

A full realm isn’t necessary for bug testing. That is where Stress Tests come in.

These "i would gladly sell my sister right now if it got me into beta" need to stop lol

Many paladins will refrain from even attempting to stun an orc because of the high chance to resist.  It would be a waste since it’s on a 1 min cd. 
---
So the psychological factor plays in as well.
---
you are aware your reddit account can get suspended for making threats even if you delete the post , correct?
---
Are you searching for the set on the Live setting of wowhead? That's the only way I can get those recolors to pop up. If you set the checkbox at the top back to the Classic setting it removes everything but the actual armor set.
---
&gt;here's how to hyperlink
---
Thanks, already knew that
---
&gt; actually you don't decide what matters for others. 
---
I didn't, Blizzard did.
---
&gt; yes, the cheesed out version and if you pushed the easy way it's hypocritical to tease the "vanilla was hard" or "vanilla is about the journey" when you trivialize the journey :) 
---
Not sure what you are trying to say here but the journey is plenty difficult as is. Much harder than retail.
---
&gt; OH THE FAMOUS WW axe which does ... nothing for mitigation?! maybe instead of learning about video evidence that you don't provide you should learn about tanking and mitigation. 
---
The point wasn't that the axe helps with mitigation. The point is he has gear beyond what you would normally see on a level 30. Even then, I don't think it matters too. People used to tank with 2h in Vanilla. If you can find any proof otherwise, I'd love to see it. But Vanilla wasn't some hardcore mode, people just have 15 years to forget.
---
I didn't figure I needed to provide it as it was the top post on here.

Here's the link since you somehow missed the biggest discussion on here since beta started. Well, you jumped on the "BlIzZaRd Is WrOnG!" bandwagon but didn't see the evidence that they weren't.
---
&gt; of the next expansion maybe? or for patchwerk only? we will never know. 
---
As in anything that they aren't maxed out for. It's like freaking out that someone is having an easy time in Scholo when they are full tier 1 vs running it in pre blue set. It's a skewed situation from the start. 
---
&gt; they are providing the nerfed version. 
---
It's 1.12. It's what they've said they were going to use. There was some nerfing but the major nerfs to old world content happened in BC like 2.3 or 2.4 something. 
---
&gt; no matter what they did, there will always be brain dead fanboys that will defend bulshit. or maybe it's astroturfing. 
---
It's not bullshit, it's accurate to 1.12.
---
&gt; if you don't like what i write, don't read. 
---
Good job saying nothing. If you don't like 1.12, don't play Classic. It's that simple. 
---
&gt; mitigation is still mitigation. where did they learned from? private servers? but they have the wrong data! 
---
I don't know what you  mean. Where did who learn what? And even then, the numbers are correct. Not based on pserver data, based on actual 1.12.
---
&gt; btw the guy tanking in the clip has been tanking from DM up to SM with a 2h. you can find the vods in the link provided. so he did it even before having "THE BEST GEAR IN THE GAME!!!!!!111one" 
---
People used to do that in Vanilla. There are a few bosses, like the Elemental in WC that actually required a shield. People forgetting after 15 years and knowing more about  how the game works is going to make it seems easier. 
---
There have been several posts over the past few days showing the damage numbers matching Vanilla videos. 
---
None of your 'arguments' have any validity. Blizzard chose 1.12, that's what's being used, no matter how much you whinge. The game is not as hard as people build it up in their memories, or as hard as Pservers made it - not sure about this personally but there were claims that pservers upped the difficulty. People have more knowledge now than we did back then and everyone is better at the game this time around. It's going to seem easier.

Runescape focused on nonsense. It was easier to make bread in rl than it was in runescape. Should’ve played tibia back in the day. Was basically everything runescape wished it could be.

Miss a lot with my and offhand white attacks really.

On vanillalike ones with accurate XP, yes.

Dude, I peaked like 150 in 2009, and when I realized that, I almost immediately burned out. 500?!
---
And that certainly is hard -- it's just a different kind of challenge!
---
It’s all relative. Sure, you’re still playing WoW, and it has WoW mechanics and combat on every class. But your experience while levelling, the mechanics you have access to (instant attacks, DoTs, stuns, mobility), the factors you have to consider in PvE and PvP, your role in group content - there is a lot more variety between classes in these respects in classic. 
---
Every class on retail has procs, self heals, movement abilities, stuns etc. Not so on classic.
---
Don’t worry, I’m still young and sprung (so I like to think) and half he time I can’t figure out whether or not McConnel is putting on an act or not.. I will say he really sells it.
---
THe force reactive disk is also very good for threat and blocking.
---
No we won't keep characters.
---
Servers will be too overcrowded to get anything meaningful done for the first 3 to 6 hours.
---
Streamers and their entourage will get in easily while the majority are stuck on the log in screen.
---
Blizzard would never gate people from being able to play with their friends.
---
Calling a group of people autistic definitely qualifies as a troll post.
---
I think I'm going to wait until week 2 for me to take time off. Server issues, overcrowding start zones, etc etc... I'd rather take time off when I'm around level 20-30 and then I can have a week to enjoy the meat of the leveling experience with less crowding and downtime.
---
maybe they can implement a system where if on a realm a faction starts becoming overpopulated the only characters of the other faction can be made.
---
You cannot have both on a PvP server.
---
So you don’t want classic wow then. Got it. 
---
Relax. Just because you pay money doesn’t mean the game is made how you want it. Stop being entitled.
---
Very true that re-speccing gets expensive, but i don't see how there's any way you could level and gear another character faster than farming the gold.   
---
Every character is separate in vanilla so individual mounts and riding licenses are necessary.   Personally i'll be maining a priest  but haven't decided how i'll spec and re-spec at 60. I don't want a bunch of characters this time around so my only alt will be something much different like a rogue.

---
&gt; It's not actually a bug.
---
It is a bug, wtf are you talking about? It's just that it is a bug that was present in Vanilla as well so they can keep it to be true to original.
---
Just because something was working same way in Vanilla doesn't equal to something not being bugged.

I've found a few ppl so far.
---
Making bread in runescape is just as easy in real life - flour and water make dough, and then you just bake the dough to make bread. Seems simple and logical to me.
---
I played Tibia back in the day, when it was good. Mained a Druid and scored tons of money from making healing runes (Exura Gran, was it?)
---
Tibia was just another entirely combat focused MMO. Go out, kill mobs, learn new spells, repeat. Runescape had much more than that.
---
What jump are you guys talking about exactly? I saw soda yday doing the one over horde tunnel and the horde gy, he also jumped on top of alliance health hut.
---
Wut
---
Retard.
---
He was talking about why play a game when your char gets wiped the moment the beta ends. My point was that you play for fun. 
---
All these games have their progress reset at the end of the season. You always have to start from scratch. Even though some have a soft reset on hidden mmr. 
---
You are right that there are shitloads of games that do not have seasons. But it still applies, why play a single player when you are prob never going to play it again after you defeat the end boss. All this time wasted for nothing? No, you had fun, excitement, you were under awe of the beauty. Games are meant to be played for fun. And if your progress is lost at the end of the beta it doesn't mean it was for nothing. You still had those moments.
---
I believe they're both rares found outside of the instance but I could be wrong.
---
__Terry Crews is a national treasure.__
---
you are so retarded lol all of the posts are there ahaha. Also  i extracted this from wow vanilla original client RIGHT NOW
---
ARMOR\_TOOLTIP = "Decreases the amount of damage taken from physical attacks.  The amount of reduction is influenced by the level of the attacker.\\nDamage reduction against a level %d attacker: %.1f%%";
---
It show 2 important things. That the amount of reduction is influenced by the level of the attacker and also the value it displays in the tooltip updated as you level up against a new level of attacker.
---
This is the nail in the coffin for you and everyone can see it now.
---
I bet it would still be good in duels. I could never beat a reckadin in a duel as warr on pservers, if a skilled player can make this work functionally the same for them it would be dangerous.
---
Although a big difference would be they’re unlikely to get stacks from your mortal strike or whirlwind instant attacks, as those aren’t as predictable as autoattacks.
---
Assuming he hasn't updated his guide since I last read it a month ago, there are sections where he says, "you'll have a chance to come back and do this later." Or, "if you can't kill this, move on to this other objective."  Even though he points this out in the very beginning, most people don't kill random mobs as they move through the world.  You NEED to be killing mobs within a /shoot ranged pull of you as you travel.  He also mentions in his guide areas where you can "grind until you are at least x xp into a level."
---
^^^ this has been confirmed
---
Well, I have no idea who McConnel is so..😅
---
That's going to be my experience too.
---
I played all of vanilla but never even got a character to level 30 because I loved questing and making new characters, plus I was 13 and retarded. I've also never played on a private server.
---
So classic is going to both be massively nostalgic and also have a lot of new experiences.

I can't wait.

Human is only better for swords.
---
Iirc combat daggers was competitive though, and eventually Seal fate became viable in raids.
---
While this aggressive nature is common in retail, one thing I saw in the Vanilla/BC is that the more knowledgeable players helped the new people and loved it.
---
I couldn't count how many guilds existed looking for new people to take in and help. 
---
I look forward to the community based WoW!
---
Not really, no.
---
I really enjoyed flying mounts back in TBC, because they were such a huge achievement, similar to the epic mount in Vanilla.
---
But it was just gold and I felt that it was already boring.
---
In Vanilla I had to finish the Paladin questline and I helped multiple Warlocks from my guild to kill the boss in Dire Maul.
---
But the moment one could use the flying mount in later expansion always killed the feeling that you are a part of the world.
---
Pulling mobs while landing to mine or get some flowers would become an annoyance and you just took off and landed on another spot just to avoid it etc.
---
I don't know, but the game suffers from free flying every where.
---
Probably not. 
---
There's almost no experience in Retail that carries over to Classic. They're completely different games now. Even the Vanilla zones are different now following Cataclysm. I'm subbed just to do the story lines and achievements.
---
Depends if you feel like dropping $15 to see the world now. But you'll be able to do that in August if you sub for Classic.
---
True, but I think there will be a significant number of people who were "hardcore" years ago who can't really be that way today. Hopefully, these "softcore" people will gravitate together to make more supportive guilds/groups
---
Full looting?

*Level 59 Human Paladin*
---
Damn this guy's spent a lot of time jerkin off
---
I'm viewing this in terms of a semi-hardcore / hardcore raiding lens. Feral tanks are viable MTs to start for several progression fights in MC and BWL but fall off to alright OTs in AQ40 and not recommended unless really good in Naxx. They can't match the threat generation when fury warriors, rogues, and mage ignites are getting geared and rolling deep. Defense cap can't be reached, even though druids have significantly more armor with leather gear than warriors in plate + shield. Feral DPS, you can't compete with the other classes unless you really try hard and get great gear (Accuria, DFT). The 3% crit aura is awesome for your top dps group but your dps production isn't worth it in my opinion, same goes for caster DPS &amp; Boomkin aura. Druids can be really good but the player has to be exceptional, otherwise it's the jack of all trades but master of none class.

Thanks for linking these clips. Perfect proofs of exactly how Leeway was NOT in Vanilla. 
---
All of your examples are great examples of the range and show some delayed Combat text or sprint mechanics being involved. Thank you for your help! :)

It was for the 5th anniversary of WoW. [Here's my submission](https://i.imgur.com/dS99Dhb.jpg) and [here's the final thing](https://i.imgur.com/5jXTBWO.jpg) with my location marked for your convenience ([zoomed &amp; cropped cos imgur compression sucks](https://i.imgur.com/rsuYUko.jpg)).
---
Oh ok. Conversation is over guys. Pack it up.
---
Stop gate keeping me from intellectual status!
---
fools on reddit can't handle their own complicity in 'ruining' games for themselves and for others with their copycat minmax """ideal""" builds and so they lash out at the messenger with terrible reasoning like this. the sad reality is that you are a terrible arguer who will only convince fools and those who already agree with you and you definitely aren't smart enough to be competitive in a video game without copying the way others play.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
You should jump on one of the instant 60 vanilla pssevers and mess around with a hunter. Mage and Hunter both seem to fit your bill very well so I would give hunter a try and see if it seems fun.
---
No you don't.
---
Maybe if you say have a resto shaman as a main on a PvE server, and a lower bracket enhance shaman as a twink?
---
Not really much point if any to have multiple of the same class.
---
PSA don't enchant pickaxe, it doesn't glow when mining
---
Ahhh! Refreshing thought: Dungeons are hard again. Even at 15.
---
I can hear the exact voice in my head when I read this.
---
I just checked myself, I was the 16th of March 2007! We started at practically the same time!
---
If I had to guess the fact that they did red quests, since quest rewards don't need a player level to be equipped (only the quest itself has a level) and that they wear many blue items. Gear stats in Vanilla and TBC were dependent on itemlevel and rarity. For example (this is not acurate), White items had 100% stats, green had 105%, blues had 110% and purples had 115%. So if an item had 100 Armor as white, it would have 105 as green, 110 as blue and 115 as purple. Add to that the other stats that get added at green rarity which also increase if the item is blue or purple. So 21 strength at green becomes 22 at blue and 23 at purple.
---
No normal player would have full or near full level 30 gear while leveling.
---
if you didnt laugh youd cry
---
Because this won't be cutting edge content, no one cares if you're guild does it first. People are playing it to have fun, if that means accommodating a few people who play a hybrid role, a lot of guilds out there are happy to do it. If you're guild is fine with it, I don't see how its a dick move. Not sure that I agree with prior posters who indicate you should just secretly do it, but definitely not a dick move if your guild is okay with it.
---
That sub will help pay the developers working on Classic!
---
Silly people.
---
I have been playing , took off about 3/4 of the way through legion.  Have loved being back so far, really enjoying the story so far even though most I have spoke to hate bfa.
---
The axe at the end Stalvan does like, half the dps of Verigan's. Fist also has int and stam.
---
Blizzard has said that the STATIC range of hitboxes is correct. They are right. 
---
What ISN"T right is the range you GAIN when you are moving; hence 'leeway'. Does that make sense? You shouldn't gain any range just because you are moving towards your target; that was not in vanilla. But something implemented later on. Hope this clarifies
---
Ah, there I gotcha. Thats definitely true - it’s one of the big reasons retail players get defensive over classic 2. Over a decades worth of effort has gone into that stupid mount scrap book, a reset to classic would invalidate all that (or so they end up feeling).
---
ND pop has absolutely swelled, for sure.
---
Curious what its like now.
---
I mean... you honestly think this was a serious topic? You think discussing would change anything?
---
At some point when i logged in they were in my bag with a lvl 35 tag, so yeah. RIP.
---
Obvious Photoshop, how stupid do you think I am lol
---
Yeah guess I can always check it out later when subbing for classic, thanks!
---
I’m almost there
---
Hi, /u/nicoIai420
---
Ya checkout my post to get a full understanding 
---
I ended up with pretty much every class in the 30s/40s lol
---
Eh your not tech savvy enough for that &lt;3 bloody oddball
---
If we make it all the way through phase 1 and server pops are still unmanageable, it’s absolutely possible that they spin up new servers and offer free transfers. That’s the best, and possibly only, option at that point. They literally can’t move on to phase 2 while layering is active.
---
You’re here, literally discussing the topic.
---
Check my post to get a full understanding of the issue. It has nothing to do with ping
---
I would also like the option to de-hunch my orc.
---
https://github.com/vmangos/core
---
You can download and build it, and then print out and change whatever. Mob health/armour is in the DB though, not in the code. When you run the MySQL DB you can use any SQL program like Heidi SQL to view/edit the values.
---
I have my T3 on my hunter though he has gone a race, faction and gender change...
---
The extra HP is calculated on top your current hp from talents/gear/base Stam so it definitely is more than 250, more like 400-600hp
---
VC= Deadmines DM = Dire Maul
---
sounds like you should roll a Hunter, You are there for your utility not your DPS
---
Perhaps it will divide the community, and the live devs will be forced to put out a product people actually want to play instead of BFA.
---
It's really weird, particularly in the major cities with the huge variety of mounts. Breaks immersion for me big time.
---
On the other hand, going on a private server and hanging in the city really feels like a fantasy rpg to me. Much more subdued mounts, and they're all on the ground.
---
what is pug raiding?
---
Undecided.  Classes I've played  (and enjoyed) in the past: Shaman (TBC-&gt;early Cata, spent some time as ele, rest as enh. Disliked resto), druid (again TBC-&gt;early Cata, loved feral -both cat and bear variants-  even if I was pushed to heal for most PvE stuff due to guild matters) and paladin (exclusively TBC shocka).
---
I'd be looking for an all-around experience, wPvP, bg (premade or not) and some raiding even if I'm PvP-focused. Tipically lean towards hybrids and support/tank roles but well, the former barely exists (notice that by *support*  I do not mean healer, but bard-like buffers/debuffers/controllers, I dislike full healer roles) and the latter is locked behind a class that feels quite far from my playstyle PvP-wise (I'm used to be a utility focused player, warrior feels like a pure executioner, minimal utility, just pure power). I'm aware druids can do it up to an extent but the thought of being pushed into healing again on it (with other classes I might be a bit open, just not with druid) makes me avoid it like the plague.   
---
I don't mind leveling being harder or not, damage meters or playstyle difficulty (this one's actually a pro for me). I'm used to playing melees, but being ranged is an option since rogue is far from my usual team player role. Main concern is being good in a group setting (PvP-wise) while having acceptable solo PvP/PvE ability (I'm quite spoiled by EQ's bard and enchanter to be honest).  Being on the tanky side (either cd-based or by raw passive survivability, like WL/spriest) is preferred.
---
Given all of this, hunter is what it feels closer to it, but my experience with it felt quite shallow (tested until lvl 34 or so) and given their popularity and their low consideration for raids it feels rough to get a spot. Their long term scaling and how it may affect PVP is a concern as well.  I'm open to anything.
---
I was always hoping classic will make change in approach to future ratail approach.  Although perhaps retail has degraded to the point of no return.
---
In vanilla I was considered raid ready with 8/8 shadowcraft, heartseeker OH and thrashblade MH. We didn't know any better back then.
---
The pop will indeed decline in the first month or two as tourists leave, yes. There's plenty of folks who will check it out and vanish. After that I believe the pop will grow over the first year easy.
---
As for superpop servers with layers - new servers like Blizz already stated, then transfers from a server. Though I will say limiting the overall pop of all layers combined would be ideal to 2.5x the pop cap so when folks leave, you can be close to or over cap and rarely see a queue thanks to the general pop logging in on different days and times.
---
As for new servers - you'd already be on a layer away from the rest of the server, know your layer's players, be familiar with the opposing faction. At that point you'd just xfer to a new server and have a new server name. The catch here is friends on different layers. The server would be given the option to split to a new server.
---
The contrary is having little population and merging with a server with people you don't know with a completely different economy and different needs. 
---
Again, you need to think past your own nose. Merges and moves happened a lot in Vanilla. It's never the best options but they are the best options when faced with a problem only merge or move can solve.
---
Think ahead, lad. Think ahead. The short term fun is wildly less important than the long term health.
---
The problem is that this is how the game looks with 0 lag which is exactly the problem.
---
I didn't start until a year into TBC, but when Vanilla launched I was 42. Some people here are as old as, or younger than, my daughter.
---
I'm looking for something similar.  So far I have only found one group planning on about those times.  It's a horde group, EST.
---
[https://discord.gg/g44dEV](https://discord.gg/g44dEV)
---
I feel this. In case it helps, I was able to scratch the itch by playing around on a private vanilla server. There's more people running around on this one server than I remember seeing anywhere other than Boralus in retail BFA. The hype is fucking real.
---
Did you start playing wow in MOP?
---
I've removed it especially for you in my 1920x1080 version. [https://i.imgur.com/Tk2zqhw.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Tk2zqhw.jpg)
---
to bad for me then :) good luck :)
---
Man, this never gets old.
---
It's been confirmed on the beta that sword spec does NOT reset the swing timer, which would lead to believe the others will not as well, but can't test them yet.
---
Their dps doesn't scale as well as the other pure dps classes, but it starts much higher as a baseline than other classes, particularly in fights where your pet can survive.  Expect to top meters in MC but to eventually drop to the bottom by Naxx (but above any healer hybrid specs).
---
There will almost certainly be more hunter spots than things like enh shaman, Ret paladin, shadowpriest, etc.
---
You still do! For any situation when it's far to a summoning stone. And not all zones have them either.
---
What information did support need? I haven't played since December of 2006 maybe but have no idea what happened to my account. I know the email address / security questions / realm / etc.
---
I'm gonna guess 3 hunters 1 pally 1 priest is the bis group
---
It’s a very interesting way to do things, but there are certainly problems with it. 
---
For example it can be very hard to get certain things to pass. If the new content isn’t “fresh” enough or change the content enough it won’t pass as it’ll already be dead content upon arrival. 
---
On the other hand if proposed new gear is too powerful or will make the game too easy it won’t pass as it’s changing the game too much. 
---
Kind of a goldilocks scenario where you have to find the perfect middle ground between enough change to be exciting and not too much change to completely void existing content.
---
On top of this you have to trust the community to make the right decisions with where the game should be going. It seems in general the community knows what not to do and where the game should be headed, but not exactly how to get there.
---
I agree so much
---
In BFA if get a 20 ilvl upgrade it feels meaningless
---
Classic? you get a +2 agility green while leveling and there is a noticeable difference, it feels rewarding 
---
things like that are things I had forgotten about vanilla
---
No MMORPG  has ever done questing as good as Runescape, ever.
---
well 5% of 5000 (a totally reasonable number for a pvp or well geared warrior to have) is 250.  I expect the bonus to be around that range.
---
For a full blown tank with buffs and flask of the titans pushing past 8k HP, then yes the 5% becomes more like the numbers you proposed.
---
At 10k base hp Buffed, the racial grants an extra 500 hp. AFAIK its not multiplicative with other %+ hp buffs like ZG's, its additive.
---
Lookit Mr. Smarty pants over here.
---
Alchemy makes ton of money lol. There is demand for potions at all levels.
---
The only mitigation stat they get is armor, and it does fuck all even at slightly higher item level only.
---
I played us server when I lived in the UK and it wasn't near as bad as you might think. Fps were another story altogether but I managed there too
---
If grenades didn't count as stuns for the purpose of resisting them, I'd say tauren isn't significantly worse than orc. But grenades are so ubiquitous in PvP that resisting 30% of them is just such a huge deal. Also, Tidal Charm could be way more common if every server has numerous layers, so that's another thing in the orc's favor. Tauren melee range is pretty nice, but resisting a stun immediately swings the fight in your favor whereas there will be many fights where a larger hitbox is of no use to you, or even a disadvantage.
---
Well the original without my text is still on Blizz's servers (http://us.media.blizzard.com/wow/anniversary/_images/ilovesc/wallpapers/source-mosaic-14400x6150.jpg) and I'm in that one too... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
&gt; how stupid do you think I am
---
Still want an answer to that? :&gt;
---
It's earned accomplishments even if you have to get past some BS and the sense of community that makes classic WoW in a league of its own.
---
because its not the same.
---
I was quite sure leeway was a thing but who knows, my memory must be getting muddied.
---
Enjin does what you're asking for out of the box.
---
I feel like Chuck norris disapproves this message...
---
Can you actually enter the portal at 10?
---
RFC
---
FTW
---
Adura Vita! That's what it was. It's all coming back now.  
---
Tibia Classic when?
---
It depended on how much time your guild had.
---
This is the best explanation I've seen on here. Every class has unique abilities that bring a new dynamic to the table.
---
I use bluehost for mine. They have the word press templates you can use for easy set up and you can easily install PHP forums and EQDKP on them if thats something youd like to do. 
---
I think I paid $300 for 3 years or something like that but that included domain name, and an email server. I can also attach other domain names to that same account for like 10 bucks a year and make websites for those domains through them with no additional cost. If you want to set up email servers for those domains it costs a little bit more.
---
Being a solo player trying to get into raids. As in, you're not in a guild and are trying to fill a void for a group.
---
Just a heads up, if it hasn't been reported yet:
---
If you're on https://classic.wowhead.com/ and go to Database -&gt; Character -&gt; Classes, and just click on Classes to get to a page with all of them, to avoid going through the nested windows again (e.g. like going to the talent calculator), then it goes to a BfA class overview page.
---
But if you click on a *specific* class from the nested window, it will go to the proper Classic version, and have all the Classic spells listed, etc.
---
Hi, /u/Roastie_Hate
---
Or someone just likes an attack bar timer for the sake of there being a visual guide to when your next swing will be. It doesn't change anything. Your next attack swing will always be the same as before. It doesn't make anything easier or "play your class." If you don't like it that's fine but don't try and act like it trivalizes anything. 
---
&gt;While you're at it, get an addon that tells you where to go for every quest and copy and paste a macro from a website that executes the hardest mechanics of your class with one button press.
---
Why do you care so much if people do? If you don't like it don't use it but there's nothing wrong with using addons if they're available for everyone else to use it. Let people play the game the way they want to play it.
---
I remember this in BC and Wotlk. Forgetting to update the macro and spending days with old gear on was frustrating, but I loved it.
---
holy shit the ^(^frost)burn
---
There is literally a zero percent chance this would happen. They would not give a huge advantage for streamers/friends and family/RNGsus people.
---
very few countries let me tell you
---
Those things + SL/SL warlocks and fucking unkillable resto druids. Every other part of TBC was just cream.
---
You do not need a BFA subscription to receive beta Access. They just choose certain individuals, based on their criteria.  Nothing to do with with account from 2004 or BFA currently subbed.
---
Ret pallies do have mana reduction, it's called Benediction. Ret doesn't have mana issues.
---
Which is why I have trouble understanding what took Blizzard so long to announce Classic. By the time that Brack told us that we really didn't want Classic it was already clear that there was a sizable population of customers that were not happy with Retail and that launching Classic would not cannibalize players from Retail to any large degree.
---
No blizzard shouldn’t do anything about it and they won’t. They won’t ever tell you you can’t make a character of this faction cause there is too many.  This is s horrible idea.
---
I *really* encourage you, and anyone else reading this comment chain, to [actually research what Athene's been up to.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FETDudTcFXg)
---
It's not an over-exaggeration. He lives with a group of people who pay and depend completely on him and his opinions and listen to his every word while practicing pseudo intellectual religion. He is genuinely nuts.
---
Yes it is but please don't yell
---
Do I spot a BfA arcane mage in the wild?
---
The group finder was added before TBC even launched. What you hated was auto-teleport and cross-realm.
---
Am I? I asked you a question and you ignored it and said discussion over. Hahah
---
Rofl.
---
&gt;False. There are many ways to balance games, rock&gt;scissors etc. being one of themMost notorious example of this would be Dota.
---
This is irrelevant to WoW as the games are fundamentally different. Balance is them being all equal, as can been seen in Retail. If your class has a spec for tank/heal/dps then you can do well at any of those rolls. This is not true in Classic/Vanilla.
---
&gt;And again, rock&gt;scissors is mainly a PVP thing.
---
Good job, a rational thought.
---
&gt;PvE vanilla has almost no balance. You could argue some classes are balanced to have damage and some utility. But then you get warlocks that have unique utility as well as top damage. So that argument falls flat.
---
Aaaaand that didn't last long. Obviously it isn't balanced. No one said it was. There is 1 truly viable tanking class. If you *can* heal you *will* heal in PvE. There are a few minor exceptions, like maybe bringing an Spriest, or certain fights that are just different.
---
Also, Warlocks are not 'top damage'. They are the lowest DPS class in the game, except maybe hunters, and only ever pass hunters with AQ/Naxx gear. And even then, Mages, Rogues, and Warriors are all much higher DPS. Like 50-100% more. Most raids will only bring 2 or 3 because they are primarily used for their utility.
---
&gt;No, its PVE because leveling/questing is PVE, dungeons are PVE, raids are PVE.
---
I know this is probably going to be a tough one for you to comprehend but... this is what's known as a subjective matter.
---
PvP can and does happen outside high end dungeons/raids. It's one of the best places for it. It can also happen when farming materials needed for the PvE content. Just trying to PvE can lead to or start with PvP.
---
PVP side of the game doesn't even have tenth of the content PVE has and had nothing at start of the game. Server type is irrelevant.
---
Everything you do is to get more gear to be better and the only way you can show it off is to either do the next raid... or PvP. It's half the game. You only say server type is irrelevant because you know it's counter to your point. The game was originally going to be PvP servers only. All of the leveling/questing, getting to dungeons and raids, using the gear you get from them, and the classes were built around the idea of PvPing.
---
Your statement might be true for EQ.
---
PVP is a "mini game" that you get to do sometimes but can entirely skip essentially. Most of the game revolves around PVE.
---
And the only reason to PvE is to get better gear for PvP.
---
&gt;They are basically the same thing.
---
Except they aren't. Battlemasters are in main cities. Which was the entire point of them. Making so you don't have to run out to BG entrances to queue. You don't even know wtf you are talking about.
---
&gt;Instead of going to portal you go to masters. Except you don't even have to do that, just have one of your party members there, which defeats the whole purpose of making you go to masters to Q for PVP.
---
This doesn't make any sense. Why would 1 person in your party run all the way to the BG entrance if they can just queue in the city? You have no idea what you are even talking about.
---
Just because you clearly have 0 idea about how BG entrances and Battlemasters were implemented and function. Originally, you had to be at the BG entrance to get in. People complained and they added Battlemasters to the main cities so you could queue at the Battlemaster in the city instead of having to run all the way to the BG entrance.
---
&gt;truly sadits Ok, we both know you're wrong, that's why you deflect, to cope
---
It's called not caring about what some troll thinks. I'll admit, I fell for it and responded, but I'm done with this one. You don't know shit about Vanilla wow.
---
Nothing smart about it. Why bother with t0 when you’re gonna get t1 and other epics from MC?
---
What? How was it the worst? That place was my absolute favorite.
---
It was pretty awesome to be an undead running around on a raptor when I really only saw maybe one more person doing that until they introduced the pvp war raptor.
---
but I just unpacked....
---
So true, I felt being huge into CS for years before WoW helped me out tremendously.  I was just familiar with the concept of editing key binds and mouse turning, positioning etc.  many people prior to 2004, their video game experience was low red consoles or RTS type games - this shit was all new!  Even the proliferation of open world single players would help new players in later years.
---
This one makes me giggle.
---
There is no question there. We currently have noone looking to fill those rolls. Also, if you put in the work, and are successful at your class, you have a place with us.
---
It’s a different game. So if anything it will give you a greater appreciation for Classic when it launches.
---
You can tank deadmines at 17-18
---
I do like that, However for me after that, Night Elves feel more distinct compared to the rest of the Alliance. Whereas Tauren feel like they can be found in more situations.
---
WF is extra "white" auto attacks, so they don't get any +hit% like say sinister strike, MS or other "yellow" melee abilities.
---
I can't speak for paladin procs, as I'm quite sure those are actually spells (similar to say flametounge or frostbrand), but function like white hits? Yeah, ganna need a ret fanatic in here to give you an answer on that one.
---
&gt;Can a seal of command proc/WF
---
While Seal of Command COULD in theory, it won't because there is no way for a paladin to ever get WF bonus from a shaman in Vanilla outside of Mind Control PvP shenanigans.  WF can't proc any other "Extra Attack" procs, but it can proc any "on hit" proc effect like wrymthalak's breath, Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom, or Hand of Rag's fireball proc.  Seal of Command can as well, hence why reckoning bombs with lots of +hit procs works well for cheesy burst damage.
---
For real. Once a good market speculation comes out as public, it’s no longer a good market speculation.
---
Pretty sure only raids with attunements restricted entry. Or if a dungeon had a key like scholomance
---
Yeah, I am aware he has written dialogue. I just never heard any audio dialogue for as long as I controlled mine.
---
What?
---
# What a world.
---
Cute message in guild chat, I hope someone taught them to ctrl-click
---
This is obviously a spoofed URL to a cloned site slightly modified to substantiate your ridiculous claim. Can’t fool me!
---
WC is harder than Deadmines
---
In fairness I have never learned how to use a warrior which is why I gave up with him halfway through wrath LOL.
---
For raiding shamans tend to be really desired, at least ones that go resto.  You want at least one in every group with melee heroes.
---
Remove Shaman and you basically have TBC tanking. Druids less so IIRC due to crushing blow mechanics.
---
Unifying +healing and +spell damage into +spell power. I'm sure there are good arguments against it, and it probably makes gear more annoying since damage casters can scoop things up, but as a more casual player who prefers healing (in instanced content) and casting in solo content, it's a huge quality of life improvement.
---
I guess you didnt bother to read my post.
---
I found Soma to be scarier than Alien Isolation.
---
That's prob the reason for classic wow in the first place
---
Sounds awesome. Thanks for the reply. I was burned in vanilla due to being young and just believing I’d get my chance so I don’t want that to happen again! 
---
I applied online at the website so we will see what happens. I appreciate your quick reply!
---
They won’t be able to. We’re only using API calls of some of the must-have addons. If they disable API features to kill us, they’ll be killing just about every addon.
---
I'm okay waiting until after the stress test window to play. I'm planning to cook dinner and eat while I stress test the login screen ;)   
---
I'm more thinking about tonight / tomorrow once everything settles down
---
This is an advertising beta first and foremost, a lot of the creators who got in have plenty of videos about testing bugs and finding things that aren't accurate. I dont think Blizzard is missing anyone who could be testing better than the people they have, if you can think of someone give us a name, I'm sure Blizzard has a very good idea of the people who can test their game the best, they have done 100's of betas at this point.         
---
As a side-note on it being an advertising beta compared to Overwatch which had the streamer beta for 9months its actually not that bad, it's still far too long to have people playing the game and I think 1 month would have been better for creating hype without muting the launch which is what felt like happened with Overwatch where a lot of my friends who I asked to buy with me already thought the game had been out for a while.      
---
Selfishly I'd like it if they closed beta completely for a month because It does feel pretty bad to not be able to play when others can(private servers i suppose), then did another streamer beta from 54-59 for the month before classic or whatever you would be most beneficial but if I was in the beta I wouldn't be saying that i'd just wanna keep playing.
---
Hopefully she's been wife'd at this point and can be talked into joining =)
---
From my understanding Hunter is good dps in the early raids and transition into more of a support class later on. Kitting is probably the most fun thing to do in a raid IMO.
---
We've had PTR for god knows how many years and it's the same as the beta, i think it's pretty safe to assume at this point that this isn't going to happen.
---
#nochanges
---
is it really 1% ,  if rough estimates of ~1000 concurrent players on the pvp realm.  Only 10 people are streamers, No.  My guess its well over 50% streamers/youtube content creators.  Which is fine, if they actually play the game for hours a day.
---
Wow I forgot about this, it was posted everywhere at the time
---
4ms and it’s 350$ in the U.S
---
So going up against a group thats better than you makes it unplayable? That doesn't make any sense
---
13
---
This would require changes....
---
Just make every spec viable... it’s that simple
---
I did, I got to the point where you wanted to change the amount of viable specs and that's where I knew that I want no changes
---
Is there a source for the cleared characters thing? I didn't know it had been settled but people seem certain
---
but they are ever so cute and puntable
---
Does the guy ship to Germany?
---
I think hes being sarcastic cuz its not a thing in classic
---
Of Warcraft
---
Are you trolling, now? Warriors should have no downtime? They have no heal and aren't super bursty, so they're one of the classes with the \*most\* downtime
---
I might roll Tauren Hunter to try that.
---
I appreciate it, i have seen it and understand the problem completely. The solution is to just not play on a server located continents away or deal with it. Not trying to be an ahole but I've learned to deal with it playing in pservers for years...
---
Yeah, will see if I can find it later :)
---
Not really.
---
I'm really enjoying Mordhau and Dauntless right now. The upcoming Path of Exile league looks amazing and should keep me going until Classic launches.
---
Yeah but you miss out on lightwell /s
---
the question was if you made these changes would vanilla be the best version of wow ever to be made.
---
Haha, yeah. I was waiting for someone to comment on that :D
---
Yeah, I agree with you. For WoW the same holds as for the general populous ... the average person is dumb and has no idea about the actual consequences of most decisions. So I agree that community votes would be a bad idea. Which does not mean that the community should not have a voice in this, but only through constructive discussions.
---
We’re planning to take Schedule II drugs and you think an EULA is going to stop us?
---
They said they aren’t making a collector’s edition. There’s the 15th Anniversary Edition, which isn’t exclusively dedicated to Classic and is already sold out everywhere.
---
mister 1% or less
---
Can you even clear deadmines at lvl 10?
---
I thought it was for lvl 19 or higher.
---
Do they hate the story or the gameplay? I have watched all of the in-game stuff for BFA even though I have no intention of playing the game and the story seems halfway decent. Not sure how I feel about what they are doing with the Horde as I have always been a diehard Forsaken/Sylvanas person but it seems pretty good to me overall.
---
I thought everyone knew this....... shit was hard back in 2005 because we didn’t know what the fuck was going on.
---
You probably won't even get the rare drop mounts on your main nevermind your alts.
---
Its worked out very well for runescape, almost all things that make the game easier are downvoted. Its a population that knows what makes the game good.
---
I don’t want the community to vote, but I will say that those changes probably aren’t inherently bad, just the way Blizzard implemented them did turn out poorly.
---
It was level 10.
---
But like, that's 'already have aggro' kinds of aggro. That's never been the paladins problem. They lack 'I don't have aggro and I want it' kind of aggro.

---
yes I know. I'm not advocating for changes. I'm simply asking a question as to if these changes where in the original version of the game, would vanilla have been the best version of wow to come out.
---
It's basically just a community with people that want to do things together. To answer your questions directly:
---
1) No you don't get additional xp for being in a guild. 
---
2) Nope, there are PUG raids and probably will be GDKP raids ( Gold DKP where you buy items ) later on
---
3) Not really, would be too hard to organize
---
The benefits of being in a guild is just having people that you can always talk to and find groups to do things with.
---
I was seduced by the one button rotation macro in ICC. Pretty much always tied my Fury warrior friend as a DK at the top of the charts, and it always pissed him off that I was just spamming 1 on my keyboard, while he was super serious about doing his rotation correctly.
---
The ones I have spoke to personally just overall hate bfa as a whole, but maybe it is because they have been slowly spoon fed this story and me coming in late get to digest it as fast as my pace allowed.
---
It has nothing to do with lag. It has to do with the inherent range of players while moving. You don't understand the problem
---
Both my friend and i live within an 2hrs of the data center in chicago and did our tests.
---
Nope, on every question. A guild is just there to help organize raids, share resources, and add another font of sociability.
---
4 hunters with level 12 pets and 1 priest.
---
Nope, it's trash.
---
Supposedly at the very very highest ends of the game with higher level Mythic+ dungeons and Mythic raiding the game is great, but I'm unwilling to wade through the river of shit that is the rest of the game to get there.
---
I worry about faction imbalance as well but little can be done
---
perhaps they could offer free transfers to servers with low alliance population for alliance players but that wont solve it, not alone anyway as you cant force transfer folks
---
Or just run from ratchet to xroads and fly to org
---
LUL
---
He is wrong though it was 10-19.
---
I’m not saying it will make or break the game. It will still be fun because there’s A LOT more to Vanilla than difficultly, but there’s definitely a missed opportunity to not tune group content similar to how private servers do. 
---
I commented about it multiple times in this thread, but pservers that were tuned were more popular (i.e, nost), versus K1 for example where people constantly complained that it was too easy. 
---
So while it may *feel* wrong to tune content, pservers are sort of a testament to the improvement in the player experience.
---
1. Not in classic WoW. In retail WoW there are perks. 
---
2. You don’t need to be in a guild, just invited to the temporary raid group. However you’ll most likely want to be in a guild if you plan on raiding. It’s mostly about organizing 40 people consistently. 
---
3. No organized guild v guild stuff in classic.
---
I don’t think they’ll restock, like many stupid companies they underestimated demand. But hey, you can still buy it from eBay for $300.
---
It WAS a thing in cata/mop/wod/legion/bfa. Not in vanilla.
---
Additionally, if you can provide evidence of the melee leeway looking like it does in my clips. Feel free! :)
---
same as the last stress test

this is the second one

That NES is getting crushed.
---
Nope. I posted a similar comment to this in another thread ...
---
Even before Brack told the Blizzcon audience that "we really didn't want Classic WoW" it was clear that there was a substantial number of players who were not happy with the path that Retail had taken. I was one of them. Blizzard made a serious mistake back then in not understanding that and Brack's statement shows just how badly he understands the MMORPG^* player.
---
\* It is my humble opinion that current Retail WoW is not an MMORPG.
---
I’m stuck between rogue/mage/warlock. I’m going to primarily be leveling with my brother who is going dwarf hunter. Mages and warlocks because I’ve never really gotten into a caster class so I thought it would be interesting and the mages aoe proficiency, raw dps capability, and utility like portals and conjuration which is pretty cool to me. Warlocks have their niche which I think is cool too plus good utility from curses, soulstones, summoning, and the class specific mounts, but I’m worried about inventory space of soul shard management and it seems like theyre overall weaker than mages. I also don’t really want to roll a gnome bc I like having my gear show but everyone says they’re the unanimous caster race for their intellect racials. Rogues because I like the feeling of equipping a weapon as opposed to a staff or something and seeing the effect it will have on my abilities and the whole stealth/lockpicking aspect is intriguing as well, and cons because my brother will be rolling a hunter and we'll probably end up sharing a lot of leather loot until he can wear mail at 40.
---
Needless to say I’m pretty on the fence lol.
---
Imo 10+ or 11+
---
He’s talking about characters from last stress test. There was a blue post stating they would let us know this week but they haven’t yet
---
No. No. And no. Guilds are just a way to group players.

This is exactly how i want to play. The dream would be to find an entire guild with the same mindset.
---
Tbh, i might make one. Call it &lt;WoW Dads&gt; or something. (i know mothers can play to, dont hurt me please)
---
Bob is my favorite streamer
---
Mr. Smite please gib Thief's Blade. :3
---
But your guild was not. Not that I would expect it to be after nearly 15 years
---
Read post. Saw entitlement. Waaaah
---
Retail is an MMO
---
but it only pretends to be an RPG
---
Yep, I didn't initially trust Blizzard at all after the annoucnement. Since then I've kept an incredibly close eye on things and with every update they give us, they've proven time and time again that they're nailing this. People can REEEE about layering all they like, Blizzard are a massive company and they're not about to shit 100 3k cap servers into the wild because some people want to recreate something that didn't work as intended in 2004.
---
Horde need all the help they can get, lol
---
&gt; used to be better?
---
Try, always has, always will.
---
Vanilla: 4/5 raids first cleared by Horde.
---
The Burning Crusade: 7/7 raids first cleared by Horde
---
Wrath of the Lich King 6/7 raids first cleared by Horde (only Ruby Sanctum, which no one cared about)
---
Cataclysm: 4/5 raids first cleared by Horde
---
Mists: 5/5 raids first cleared by Horde
---
Warlords: 3/3 raids first cleared by Horde
---
Legion: 5/5 raids first cleared by Horde
---
BFA: 3/3 raids first cleared by Horde
---
RS2: Vietnam and a Pserver are all ive been doing since beta came out. Got into the stress test and played the shit out of that as well.
---
I gotcha. I guess that is not how I read your post. I think you may have a point there although I don't necessarily think the class imbalances detracted from the game it clearly forced those classes to be underplayed and underutilized. You're not wrong.
---
I still don't want it changed for classic.
---
I'm sure I could try to look for some stuff in youtube from 2005/2006 pvp, but it would be hard to argue its not from sheer bad latency.
---
This is false. They've stated multiple times an active subscription is needed:
---
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-testing-schedule/49664
---
"To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. "
---
Warlock. Paly and warlock is God tier duo questing.
---
It absolutely changes combat.  ???  There's a reason so many people use it, it's not just aesthetics.  It absolutely lets you time your attacks/kiting/ability use.  
---
Of course people are free to use whatever addons they please and I have no problem with it, so long as they acknowledge it provides them an advantage that players without the addon don't have. 
---
 That's all.  Your post is a prime example.  It is infinitely easier with this addon to know when to walk back into melee range against a hamstrung target, or gauge exactly how much time you have to switch targets to interrupt a cast and switch back to your original target without missing a swing.  That's fine if that's how you want to play, just acknowledge that you aren't naturally outperforming other players in the same position without the addons that mess up the execution of one of those things.
---
oh I see
---
:O
---
I don't think creating new realms would be that simple.  When you login now on the beta, you get put on a random layer.  You can have friends and guildmates spread across many layers.  Any splitting up of all that into a permanent realm would be a big mess.
---
An additional bonus from scorpions is that its another poison debuff to dispell before they can dispell viper sting
---
Here we go again.
---
To answer you briefly, no. It would not
---
It was nothing like it is in retail people were for sure pugging the 20 mans on my server and and semi-regular 40s,  well behind the guild progression curve, but still existent.  But this is kind of where the "social aspect" and "reputation" part came into play because they weren't really true pugs outside from everyone being in different guilds.  It would be alts of higher end raid guilds and the better mains from more casual raid guilds that weren't clearing said content yet.
---
&gt;  if rough estimates of ~1000 concurrent players on the pvp realm. Only 10 people are streamers, No.
---
What, no. Your example is flawed because you're equivocating time played between streamers and non-streamers. People streaming the game are obviously going to be online way more often than your average non-streamer beta tester. My estimate was only considering the total number of people invited to the beta, regardless of playtime.
---
And then you think that out of 1000 concurrent players 500 of them are streamers? That's ridiculous.
---
Ret is legitimately excellent in PvP when it's played well. Spec 20/0/31, wear hybrid gear, stand in the back, throw out Cleanse and Flash of Light, Repentance for emergency CC, and then use your 2H weapon to blow up a Horde who overextends / thinks they can take you because you're healing. Rets can even throw on a shield and tank in AV thanks to Righteous Fury.
---
Enhancement runs out of mana much too quickly to play like a hybrid. They need to use max rank shocks to do anything and that runs them OOM way too fast to support others.
---
Dude, he's talking about the balanced made by the patches since release all the way to 1.12, lmao.
---
????
---
If you plan on fishing a lot in vanilla dont play gnome... in vanilla I played a gnome mage and trying to fish allover STV coast was tough sometimes cuz I was so short.  To reach those far pools I'd end up swimming and couldn't cast, pretty dumb
---
Lol get your affairs in order before you are lost forever
---
The easier they made the game, the more subs they lost. The popularity of classic is going to prove that challenge has value. The real value of a piece of gear is how much you had to work for it, not the color of it's name. Throughout vanilla I only had one epic item, these days you get a full set just for logging in, they even gave away legendaries, what's the point? Blizzard is hopefully going to see the error of their ways.
---
I dont either. but if those changes had been there in 2004. would vanilla be the best version of wow and by this I mean expansion to have ever been made?
---
Yeah, probably. And for some of those the return doesn't seem worth it cause ppl dont like to pay a sub anyways.
---
Worst poll of the week my dude
---
There's literally no reason why having the ability to realm transfer would be a bad thing. The "purity for the same of purity" crowd is so obnoxious. "It has to be exactly the same or you don't want Classic" is entitled as hell.
---
You're being a hypocrite calling that guy entitled. Fuck off with this attitude.
---
I was one of the officers of &lt;Grovestreet&gt; back in Vanilla (Druid Captain).  I hadn’t seen this video in over a decade and I just today noticed I’m mentioned in Gchat about 90 seconds in.  I still remember a couple good stories about Unbreakable and all the drama surrounding his Rag hammer.
---
I haven't seen a true MMORPG released recently, can anyone name one? Granted I've been out of the scene awhile - I played things like Age of Conan, RIFT, and Tera. I know there's massive MMO's like Fortnite but nothing has an RPG element that takes any time investment, or does it?
---
&gt; They want an authentic experience, yet are playing the OP classes, **min maxing Racials, setting up graphs and charts to optimize play time**, etc. That wasn't Vanilla, so that's already not authentic.
---
Why not? The beauty of Classic/Vanilla is the ability to do whatever you feel like. A lot of people prefer to min-max and squeeze everything they can out of their chars - Let them. Why should min-maxing be reserved for retail Arenas/Mythics only?
---
Technically AV can be guild vs guild, or at least raid team vs raid team.
---
Ah ok. Assuming HK is their total HK and rating is their weekly honor/cp.
---
16 hours a week is a part time job.  If you were in a top guild, you literally had to fill out an application to join and have an interview. 
---
Either way, I think this time around is going to be a lot easier for people to experience end game content and a lot less time consuming.  
---
People are more knowledgeable, social media and YouTube are a thing that wasn’t truly around for Vanilla wow (especially at launch), Raid mechanics then are easier than a lot of current dungeons bosses, where just not standing in fire was probably good enough, and a lot of 1.12 dungeon gear is going to be on par with raid gear.
---
which expansion in your opinion would still have been better?
---
This may be what you're looking for
---
NA Horde PvP EST morning/afternoon raiding guild.
---
I havent played retail since cataclysm. so I dont see what that has to do with anything. I've been playing pservers for a year now.
---
I tanked it the other day as bear at 18 with crap gear, but I got absolutely plundered on VC. I had to let one add bounce around... couldn't survive just straight up tanking all 3. Died when second add wave came and I tried to take all 3 lol. Did have a lower level pally healing but it was still rough damage. 
---
Smite I just pulled very far back to give us some little breathers. Rest of instance could have done at 17 pretty easy I think.
---
I was having that problem until a couple days ago. I started up Dauntless and I can't put it down. I am also a huge fan of Monster Hunter but World got boring too fast for me, the end game grind wasn't the same with such a small roster. 
---
I may even skip the stress test tonight to play more Dauntless.
---
I was a 19 year old college freshman taking big advantage of my dorm's T3 connection.
---
Apparently not.
---
Garbage loot, worse than heroics.
---
It's a 10 man entry raid that leads in to an expansion of 25 man raids
---
It was incredibly large and drawn out with loads of walking. 
---
Chess event
---
I don’t disagree with the time aspect but difficulty does play a role (along with time investment, etc.) in the sense of accomplishment from completing content. 
---
Also, we have a history of pservers to look upon to see the effects of tuning. In presumably blizzlike servers such as K1, players constantly complained about the content being too easy whereas servers with increased dungeon/raid difficulty like Nost were more popular as better emulations of the Vanilla experience, accounting for increases in player skill/knowledge over time.
---
Where’s the Horde flight path in the Hinterlands?
---
Yikes. And you say I have an attitude? 
---
You’re taking this way too serious. 
---
How is that entitlement haha. Wanting the game in its original state is entitlement? I’m sorry but I honestly don’t get why you’re being so hostile over MY opinion. 
---
Don’t like my opinion? Downvote and move on. No need to throw out insults. This is a video game.
---
Someone sell me on Paladin or Druid. I've been thinking I'd do Warrior and Priest since I love tanking and healing, but the possibility to do both roles with one character is very appealing. I am still open to making a pure dps alt for gold/mat farming.
---
I doubt I'll ever main tank, I've done that a bit on retail and it's too much commitment for me nowadays, but tanking dungeons is an absolute must, while leveling and at 60. Seems like Paladins are ok tanks except for lacking a taunt and having mana issues, and Druids are just meat shields. I tanked on a feral a good bit in WotLK, it wasn't super engaging but rawr you are a bear. And both Druid and Paladin seem to have a strong niche in PvP which is awesome.
---
Totally fine with having to heal in raids/PvP.
---
But can you prove it in a 3 pixel x 3 pixel GIF?
---
Luckily that’s the gear you need for pvp anyway lol
---
nope 
---
new servers new names
---
Leper gnome
---
Nah, you're wrong.
---
Yes constantly.  Right until Blizzard announced classic then it was the best thing ever.
---
I mean to be fair it is his job so he just plays whatever is popular and will get him views.
---
yea no, I went pserver
---
Im a WoW veteran.  At first I was going to roll mage because its my favorite and I have the most experience with them.  
---
Then I saw that dumb poll and mages were #1, so I thought, "Hmm, maybe I'll roll a warrior so I can lead groups, teach noobs, and get shit done."  
---
I dunno what to do.  
---
Edit:  I've leveled both in vanilla and know what to expect.  Should I just flip a coin?
---
I hate the idea of it but I would certainly do that.
---
This is the #1 reason why Towellie was so against Classic. He won't be able to hide how bad he is anymore.
---
are you saying the dungeons are not as they were in vanilla?
---
do you have evidence to back said claim?
---
&gt; This is the #1 reason why Towellie was so against Classic. He won't be able to hide how bad he is anymore.
---
He makes enough now that if he cared he could get it fixed. If he wanted.
---
I’d rather be downvoted by people with the reading comprehension of a gnat than to ever use the abomination that is /s.
---
But will it have RTX shading
---
k
---
Twenty-three
---
And you are totally wrong.
---
No idea but I dont think they will have that many servers as they did before. Personally I hope they dont just because I want server to be populated like Full/high at all times and from watching streamers play looks like they need to fix the sharding just a bit. I see alot of phasing in and out.
---
I blame smartphone games and apps for completely destroying our brains reward systems
---
I just wanted confirmation that people throw out the word mitigation in the wrong context
---
Not sure if this is /s or just ignorance.. The data being used in the Beta is the old 1.12 archived data Blizzard found in their systems. There are some bugs and some holes that need to be addressed, but what's happening in dungeons right now has been confirmed as accurate.  
---
Nothing was changed to make it "easier".
---
The only thing you can’t buy from another tailor is robes of the void. Tailoring is overrated for a lock. Would do mining engineering or herb alch or dual gathering.
---
They are easier because we know more now.
---
They look cool but dismounting every time you need to go through a door gets annoying quick.
---
Disc/Holy is a good early PVE spec because you need the additional mana more than anything else. Divine Spirit is also a great raid buff. You can make friends with mages by giving them PI during boss fights, and PI also enables you to farm DM:E lashers earlier. Overall it's probably the best new-60 PVE build.
---
All the old servers are now retail servers with the same names. We'll be getting new servers with new names.
---
Hey
---
I'm undecided about everything.
---
The classes I am interested are : Rogue, Warrior, Warlock, Shaman
---
What I love about all games is mobility, as I main DH on BfA, and play ganking/mobile heroes on Dota.  
---
I like the idea of doing DoT damage too, where Rogue and Warlock could come in. But i've read that there will be abundance of DPS classes and that getting a spot in the raid/dungeons will be difficult.
---
So thats where Shaman comes in. I've read that hybrid classes are only supposed to heal, but I wonder if an ele/enh shaman is viable?
---
Like if it was possible to level all 4 I would definitely, but I dont think ill have enough time to level all haha
---
If you looked at my evidence you would see it has zero to do with lag u can replicate this by jumping
---
They said new server names.
---
While what you’re saying is true, player psychology and how people respond to the game is an element that should be considered. 
---
We actually have a history of pservers to look upon to see the effects of tuning and how players respond. In presumably blizzlike servers such as K1, players constantly complained about the content being too easy whereas servers with increased dungeon/raid difficulty like Nost were more popular as better emulations of the Vanilla experience, accounting for increases in player skill/knowledge over time.
---
You can have a single Mage farm the reputation needed with Hydraxian Waterlords from the elemental mobs in the north western corner of Silithus. He will port in and out of the dungeon to douse each rune.
---
You also need to do the trash kill quest and the boss kill quest for the hands. The trash kills will be done the first few pulls of the raid, he ports out, turns it in, picks up the hands quest and is in the raid for the kill of those bosses. It's really easy, just time consuming on the Mages part.
---
Thats true but the current gold cost is pretty negligible, I would like to see the gold cost high enough to discourage constant changes.
---
But but but muh world firsts
---
ya but factor in afk time. and that it could be between 5-6 years depending on the exact dates.
---
For pvp with all the attacks flying around it seems to be impossible to time, because if you sit down and get hit you stand up automatically, right? And since sitting down has an animation your opponent has to leave you alone while you slowly sit down.
---
Might be exploitable for leveling or farming later on to kill mobs quickly.
---
Thinking of guild members.
---
Like maybe someone was named dutch
---
Has nothing to do with ping, it's a code residue from Legion/bfa client. Where anytime you are moving you gain range. In vanilla is not correct
---
Christ, reading a conversation on r/classicwow about pservers is like over hearing Tony Soprano talk to his guys about the ‘ting wit’ da guy.
---
well naturally but I dont think thats his point
---
Where do you get your numbers?
---
A guild gets you:
---
The ability to join guild chat, which is a global chat with just your guild members, similar to a party or raid chat except all the time and everyone in the guild
---
The ability to see the guild pane, which is a tab where it'll show who's online, their level, class, and rank in the guild.
---
A cool guild specific guild tabard (that your guild leader designs and can change)
---
Your guild name pops up under your character name, so other players can see.
---
That's it. You don't get anything else.
---
i'm deciding between Priest and Druid. I've got about 4 friends playing and none of us play the same classes as each other, so Shaman, warlock, rouge, and hunter are off the table. I tend to be more PvE oriented. I have had a lot of success on Druid on MoP, Legion, and BFA. In Legion and BFA I was part of mythic raiding teams. Druid in vanilla however is well "Jack of all trades master of none" they don't excel at anything and they lack burst damage they normal just widdle players and mobs down. I tend to play more towards support classes. So i thought priest would be cool, amazing healer, i'd probably play like a PI Build (31/20/0) and if i chose to level as shadow id think id enjoy leveling more. Also i think it would be a neat goal to complete the Benevolence Questline.
---
The one where there is no expansion.
---
No his phrase "he’s hitting me from a cross the Atlantic” " - is referring to a code residue from Legion/Bfa client because of meleeway which was not in vanilla.
---
Really? Because doing even a relatively tame 12 or 13 key is much harder than any 5 man content that was ever in Vanilla. 
---
Not needing a tank for m+ is news to me... I'll be sure to try that tonight.
---
The early dungeons are easy because they were easy in Vanilla and they're not making changes.
---
Yes, I know. And introducing them was a massive reach back then.
---
No it wasnt. Sitbatching is not the same as sitting to trigger the proc. Dont confuse the two.
---
Delusional idiots that don't realize that an old game does cost money for upkeep, too, are not to my concern. So obviously I'll be gladly paying a sub to play Classic.
---
Not to mention things like utilizing keybinds (just browse the old screenshots) and the fact that voice comms is something everyone has now whereas back then it was an actual perk for a guild (we have 40+ slot vent!!).  There are so many things that are taken for granted now that were luxuries and/or uncommon back then.
---
Some people have fun by being good at the game. Why is this so hard for Reddit to understand?
---
Not really, just bring your alt to a farm run, I hit 60 on a warrior alt on a pserver recently and my guild was just throwing epics from MC and BWL at me so I could gear up quick for AQ, definitely didn't take months, more like weeks.
---
This is exactly why I'm running with Orc Warrior with the added Prot Stun Resist Talents
---
The “Classic WoW is gonna be the Dark Souls of MMOs” crowd is finally shut up. Like cmon, Classic is definitely less “hold my hand and walk with me” than Retail, but its not going to be very difficult like many vanilla veterans were pushing it to be. Players are too skilled and familiar with the games mechanics at this point, anyone who thought this was going to be some great challenge was delusional.
---
Side note: hopefully this promotes more build diversity. Tank Paladins anyone?!?
---
This link is safe but be careful of posting or clicking links that lead to a login page for future reference
---
If you’re going to be burned out after a few months and 30 levels then maybe you don’t want to play classic long term anyways. Just my view on it.
---
There already was a poster who linked many clips showing the proper range from vanilla and you see can see all his posts contain the right range and then one instance of either the combat text being delayed or rogue sprint being involved giving the illusion of bigger range
---
There's always Berserk + demonic/dark rune
---
Reddit began converting gifs into MP4 automatically recently :(
---
I’d like to play something that complements my friends who are playing hunter and warlock. I expect we’ll be doing 5 mans and world PvP more than anything. Not sure I’ve got time for raiding this go around.
---
We’re going to be playing Alliance which is unfortunate because shaman would be an easy pick for me.
---
Warlock, improved imp spec. You're rare and you're there mostly for support functions (summon, banish, curse, imp, soulstone) that depend little on gear and require no skill. If you have bags full of shards you can PUG into a raid that has few or unreliable warlocks, which will be most raids, because not many people want that job.
---
I'm almost certain that it generally had upgrades from heroics.
---
So what?
---
It was large, it had cool bosses, it looked really good compared to all the other raids, and again, so what? Bt was huge. SSC was pretty big too.
---
What's wrong with the chess event? It was a new thing, it was pretty neat, and it was free loot. Are you just upset because it takes longer to do transmog runs in there or something?
---
This is odd. 
---
So Blizzard confirmed that reckoning  procs caused by a “crit” due to sitting is a bug and was never in classic.
---
However this is something different, was standing at the right time to get a crit a bug present in classic at the time? If so do they leave it in? If they remove it that is technically a change.
---
Would be interesting to hear an official response to this as I’m sure it has been reported loads since the streamers showcased it.
---
I’ve always felt like you earn everything in vanilla whereas in retail the gear is spoon fed.
---
Damn you made me chuckle on the train.
---
By the time I got it in early 2005, I was only... 12. Wowza.
---
One of the greatest experiences of my life.
---
Isn't there supposed to be a Horde flight path in the Hinterlands?
---
What are you talking about? No it doesnt
---
Guilds are scam.
---
No bonuses, no perks, no exclusive content, just a bunch of randoms that want to be your friend.
---
People in guilds are a bunch of creeps.
---
This isn't true, the toggle existed in WoD. The new models function with the old animations.
---
for sure
---
in retail it falls from the sky and epics mean very little, actually they mean nothing lol
---
No. There are reasons. You just choose to ignore them. People find him, his personality or even just the way he looks fucking annoying. He has a face you want to punch, especially the smile. It looks like a sarcastic smile. And of course people are pissed with seeing nothing but people post about asmon here all the fucking time. So yes, people will be pissed it's like an advert all the time you click into this sub or a post. Somebody somewhere brings him up.
---
I think you may have kinda missed my point, my bad since I don't think it was very clear.
---
My point was, being a top 5% player takes only 16 hours a week, so being able to successfully and regularly clear the raid can take a heck of a lot less time than that.
---
I mean, the reason you can throw 5 people on n a group and go is because people know how to play their classes much better now.
---
Wow, 15/6/2005 for me, has it really been that long?
---
Blizzards are not providing enough details on such subtle issues. On the video, pala is just spamming /sit without visible worry about batches.
---
Yessir
---
my little one is 9 months now, I wish I had money to get a switch lol I miss gaming so much
---
If you play hearthstone you will recognize a lot of spells from classic wow! welcome to the community.
---
tips: enable extra bars in the UI, you will have a lot of spells! use hotkeys for your favorite spells and make sure to spend a little time key-binding and re-keybinding as you level. Your bf has probably told you you can use lower rank spells to get effects like slows without using as much mana. Playing a wow character well feels like playing a piano sometimes if you can do it right! (disclaimer: I totally can't play piano :o )
---
Also, I'm a girl with small hands and I have trouble reaching modifier keys and far hotkeys sometimes. I got a mouse with 3 buttons near my thumb that was game changing for me back in the 2000s. Maybe this is common now but if you dont have one, highly recommend! Getting used to hitting all the keys fast will probably be the biggest adjustment from console gaming.
---
edit: got curious about mice and found this [https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-naga-trinity](https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-naga-trinity)jesus I can't tell if this thing will be great for my tiny hands or horrible. Im def behind the times with my 3 keys tho!
---
They already do.
---
- Step 1: Don't do things that grant XP
---
- Step 2: There is no step 2
---
I wasn't, but for different reasons.
---
I really, really hate Activision Blizzard because of their actions over the past couple of years and I'd made the decision to never give them my business ever again.
---
So when they announced Classic WoW, I thought it was pretty cool that they were finally doing it, but I had no intention of ever playing it.
---
And then the Beta started. It only took about 15 minutes of watching Asmongold's stream to make me start questioning my stance. I starting reading some of the developer posts about how they are planning to recreate the vanilla experience and I realised how much care was being put into. It reminded me of what Blizzard used to be like, back when they _actually were_ Blizzard and not Activision Blizzard.
---
The final nail in the coffin was watching Hobbs stream the game. My nostalgia has defeated my hatred and now the only thing that will stop me from playing Classic WoW is if they selling mounts, pets and other cosmetics like they do in retail.
---
I just stayed up like 48 hours plus with no stimulants... a crying baby will do that..
---
I agree. Also the fact that leveling takes so damn long means that investing into items like a Skinning knife with 30 spellpower and other enchanted items actually gives a really good payoff.
---
All my alts on private servers have always had max engineering and twinked out gear. I dont care if it means spending a lot of gold on them, because leveling the characters will be a blast.
---
I was around 500 across live and various pservers by when I quit with wod. 
---
My main is from 2004 and I raided through Soo. 500 days is impressive by 2009
---
I’ve got rookie numbers.
---
Uhm. Go Dire Maul north without a tank or healer and let me know how did that work for you
---
so you're saying vanilla is the best expansion, that's fine it's your opinion, I think tbc was overall a better expansion but lacked some things vanilla had.
---
Woah there tiger, I said ‘used to be’ because I was talking about the past, I didn’t mean to imply anything about the present. 
---
English is not my first language, appologies
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCuBh7VwRHs
---
Whenever I’m leveling a warrior or paladin I generally hold off till 19 or 18 if I’ll hit 19 before VC.
---
Im eu
---
There have been pservers up for a decade with consistent player bases. I don't see why they can't keep classic wow going 'forever' and just merging servers until there's only a handful left. Even then whats the real cost of maintaining 2-3 servers for a few thousand people to play the game?
---
Try and be consistent with sleep, even if your getting like 3 to 5 hours, sleep at the same time every night. No lights, no TV etc.
---
Vanilla dungeons are, in fact, teachers. That is, they teach skills and techniques that will be needed in later dungeons up till raids. Most low level dungeons (18-35) are pretty easy when compared with the more advanced dungeons (36-54). But they all teach specific boss mechanics, team dynamics and different types of mob pulling. Any new player (or post wrath retail player) would do well to run dungeons a lot to get the skills needed to do well in raids.
---
Thats Esfand. Show some respect.. you pleb.
---
If you're the server owner, you can use the Emoji options in the server settings to just upload these images as custom emojis.
---
Its hard to say if these changes would make it a better game. These changes wouldn't just require tuning to the class but new gear options. One of the reason these class choices arent as viable as others has a lot more to do with armor availability so it would have completely changed the gearing process for everyone.
---
So you'll have to go through your youtube history, remove some wow things that might relate to him - like delete it from your history, then when it recommends it you can use the X in the top right of the video to tell it essentially to "fuck off recommending this video/creator to me"
---
Sad, ninjalooting that head is funny, and would be even more good-humored in classic where we can just loot-trade it afterwards.
---
it's always Christmas time in dun morogh.
---
Ask your weed dealer
---
&gt; Should Blizzard do something about it?
---
About what? This is a hypothetical non-problem that currently only exists in your imagination. So I'm going to go with no.
---
Yea I like this conspiracy theory. Blizzards always cater to casuals. Even with "hardcore" Classic, they're not only picking the easiest 1.12 patch, they're also artificially making things more easy because no one can check.
---
I don't think it's true though :)
---
Stun resist is so juicy for warlocks though
---
here's my guess: there was a nerf in 1.12 to get  people leveled for 2.0 and no one at the time really noticed. is 1.11 harder? maybe they should go with 1.11 values. but it's just a guess, maybe there wasn't a nerf and everything is as it should be. :) I don't really care because I play the game for social interactions and not for hard content
---
Probably. At least for 40 mans like MC and BWL. 
---
When they first came out that wasn’t really the case and each server had maybe 3 or 4 guilds at most  (per faction) running progression content, but I remember toward the end a lot of casual guilds were at least getting through MC. 
---
This time around I wouldn’t be surprised if we see some pugs able to knock things like MC and ZG out.
---
You asked for an opinion and I gave you mine like 4 comments ago.
---
Creating two accounts is the only way this can work.
---
Sure and i have 2 friends coming back. I just dont see them lasting. Its a trip and then its boring
---
Yeah...all of those things sound infuriating to me apart from the very last one.
---
Fiance threw a curveball at me and now wants to roll Druid, I'm not gonna fight over gear with her and our group is really light on melee dps so I'm gonna reroll.
---
Warriors are going to be populated, but the general consensus seems like a lot of people will reroll during leveling a warrior (therefore less total warriors at 60). Having a hard time figuring out if I'd rather play warrior or rogue.
---
They both have great damage, both are needed for PvP groups, both have fun playstyles... 
---
It will be a hard decision, at least I have 3 months to think about it.
---
It's a form of protest, by not voting you are not participating in something you see as corrupt. The president effects us all, the same way as other states electing their representatives. Do you not get to complain about the senators from other states because you didn't vote in their election? When everyone buys into the 2 party system you will always be voting for the lesser of two evils which is wrong because you are still voting for evil.
---
1.5 years is a long time. In Vanilla I started as a noob (Didn't realize I could rez my pet) and made it through BWL and half of AQ40 with a low/mid-tier raiding guild (probably being carried a little). I wasn't what I'd call skillful until TBC, but regardless, I was able to experience most of Vanilla.
---
Everyone was a noob like you at some point, but everyone also grew to different points on their journey. Couple million players, and yeah I buy that a bunch of folks on this highly self-selecting sub raided Naxx. ....Not to mention pservers
---
Thotbot... That's a name I haven't heard in a long, long time...
---
Can anyone tell me what all the colors were for each low level enchant? Would really appreciate it :D
---
what all do you do for 6 years on a server where content never changes?
---
I am not worried about the burnout at all. however I think the excitement will feel better on official release. So I don't mind waiting til then.
---
To the first issue: not really, as pservers are sort of a testament to this. Like in Nost, it's been observed that tuning dungeon/raid content goes a long way in preserving the Vanilla experience in terms of difficulty without altering the mechanics or spirit of the game. If anything, leaving the content untuned leads to a more retail-like experience because same-level content is completed easily with no fear of wiping and seemingly free loot.
---
To the second issue: I don't think tuning is a significant barrier to new players because as we all know, Vanilla is not a mechanically intensive game. Rather, the difficulty stems from the amount of knowledge, such as knowing the optimal spec, knowing to use downranked spells, etc. In 2019, even casual/new players access guides, youtube, and twitch and thus will be capable of handling increased difficulty in the same way a new player in 2005 was capable of handling the difficulty of the time. In other words, the new player Vanilla experience would also be better preserved with tuning.
---
Priest and warrior, name a better duo
---
The other day I was day dreaming about the quest in desolce where you get to side with one of the centaur clans, id really like to do that again
---
Then realize that you basically invited yourself to start bugging me, and continue to try to have the last word on top of that for something that doesn't even really concern you.
---
Okay... then why be on the classic Reddit? Clearly not for you.
---
I think a lot of people wouldn’t think of it. But I’m in beta now, and since I started playing back in 2004, I was jealous (envious? In awe?) of the guys who got to play beta. They got to witness development.
---
I don’t get that with this beta, just bugs. But it’s cool none the less. 
---
Beta is always special, if it’s something you’re into, but streaming it all definitely builds the hype like it’s an exclusive game.
---
PI priests are cool, just don't expect to spam PWS.
---
I wanna know how boned I will be as a shammy :(
---
Damn I hate cookie!! Never drops his damn wand!
---
Haha. No. It's not social media. It's a fucking video platform. If YOU use it for social media content, that's your choice. But first and foremost it has been and will always be a video hosting site. The idea it's social media is laughable.
---
City of heroes has a private server up that's pretty legit
---
&gt;The hardest part about raiding was getting 40 people to show up on time.
---
This is what I heard the raiding guildies I knew always talk about. The phrase they used was "Its like herding cats" I do think people underestimate the difficulty in finding 40 people to keep together and follow basic tactics for 2 to 3 hours. I mean the well organised hardcore guilds will not struggle with this but for the normal/casual guilds this will be the true struggle.
---
This. And a secondary thing is also: We'll be able to see who's badass and who isn't. No transmog, so seeing full tier 2 from far away means full tier 2. You don't fuck with those people so easily.
---
Disc trades 25% spirit as +healing and 10% overall +healing for 10% +mana and one of the strongest caster cooldowns in the game. It's a very good spec. There might be some fights where having every bit of extra healing is necessary for progression, but not as many fights as having every bit of extra damage is necessary for progression.
---
Man, looking at your history, you're really going through a lot of sacrifice by bringing your opinions to this sub.
---
That sacrifice is your karma. Yikes.
---
Getting the unarmored mount on my main was the biggest goal I had set for myself. I was really looking forward to it specifically. Hearing "you think you do, but you don't" about my personal goal was like a kick to the gut.
---
Yep.
---
Yeah im looking forward to being exited for greens when leveling lol
---
Yeah of course I think the game would have been better with some better game design. That seems like a no-brainer.
---
The vanilla WoW tanking meta is a very obvious holdover from EverQuest, and I don't think it's any coincidence that one of WoW's game designers was known for throwing temper tantrums whenever any class other than Warrior was a viable raid tank in EverQuest.
---
Guy got Monks nerfed and then jumped ship to WoW right after. The ultimate troll.
---
First lets talk costs. Talent respecs cap at 50g, with a decay of -5g per month that you dont use a respec. I believe it took 10 respecs to reach the cap with probably 2-4 respecs for normal leveling purposes and setting up your final lvl 60 build. Completely ballparking this, but making a new alt is probably 150-175g (100g for mount, ~40g for skills + other misc costs) all told 1-60. If the discussion is around the goal to regularly respec so you can perform multiple roles and be optimzed, then the convo should just be at 50g per respec since we'll absolutely get there rather quick. This means to make an alt, the cost of 6-9 days played time (5 days rushed, 3-4 days with rested exp) will allow you to swap roles/specs for free. Even in cata with dual specs I was respeccing nearly daily to manage my tank/dps pve specs and tank/dps pvp specs on my warrior, but in cata the cost was very very manageable which is the only reason i respecced so much. If it was as costly as it is in classic, I would never have swapped between a pve/pvp build and just kept a tank and dps dual spec.
---
1) This all depends on the player. If you can't play a lot then having two alts of the same class is just a non starter. If you really love the class and the 1-60 journey and do have time and dedication, then having two alts of the same class can be super convenient in the long run. I'm going warrior, and i can perform dps and tank with just a single spec, but it wouldnt be optimal for dps or pvp (both of which I really want to be involved in) and could be problematic for raiding.
---
1.1) If you want to be able to tank or dps whenever you want, then it is simply NEVER economical to just respec on one character. With a cap of 50g and a -5g decay per month, putting in the effort to always grind out enough gold to achieve this will end up costing more ingame money and real life time eventually. Unless you're playing nearly 24/7 you'll never have enough money to respec every single time the need arises.
---
1.2) This is what most everyone will do. To a certain extent and certain classes, you can get away with performing multiple roles on a single spec. Warrior for example can tank endgame dungeons as fury just fine if not better than prot. Going dps with the same fury build will also be viable, but not as viable as a true full dps fury build. However, at certain levels of content, you may not be viable at all in one of those roles for raiding.
---
2) You would need to buy 2 licenses and mounts
---
I know the jumps thanks for letting me know. Sounds like you need to get better at the game.
---
I dont belive you
---
39
---
Oooo that's a good one I'd forgotten about that! Desolace was a fun zone, I have lots of memories there, too!
---
No, you dont
---
I see your point the leather wouldn't be so bad but the plate gear might have an issue. but you dont think in 2004 had the game been released with these issues addressed it wouldn't have made it better?
---
Theres a video of someone doing like 20 flips
---
No. You will select WoW on the launcher tab, then above the play button/Download button, IF you are in the Beta or Stress test, a dropdown menu will appear for you to toggle over to Beta or PTR or Live. 
---
Personally, I'm only in stress test and dont have a PTR account. As such, before I was invited to Stress test, I didnt even have the dropdown to toggle away from live. As soon as I was invited to stress test the dropdown menu appeared
---
Oh maybe people figured out how to play the game over fifteen years
---
Pets react 1 second after given a commands played yesterday and that wasn't fixed.
---
Trust.
---
me too dude, me too!
---
I wholeheartedly agree with this. Inflated numbers start to feel pointless and stupid after a certain point.
---
the easy suggestion would be warrior to be the tanky melee, or one of the classes with healing specs, to complement their ranged DPS
---
??
---
Are you really basing this opinion on level 30 twinks?
---
&gt;Having a hard time figuring out if I'd rather play warrior or rogue.
---
Go Rogue so you can stealth around the world together. I can't recommend this enough.
---
Wrong
---
14 years since vanilla was EOL but it too still works just fine.
---
Ashenvale, Stranglethorn Vale, and Un’goro Crater.  Not sure if it’s the greenery, or what but I really enjoy those zones.
---
I can't look at the rogue video right now, but is he an undead? Because the shadow resistance might explain the difference in damage taken for Arugal.
---
Winterspring hands down. The zone and the music are beautiful, good amount of quests, and theres always a reason to keep coming back throughout the entire game with timbermaw rep, winterfall firewater, eko farming and wintersaber mount.
---
Well of course. Vanilla is a great game and there's a lot more to Vanilla than difficulty. However, there's a definitely a missed opportunity for Classic to tune content.
---
As observed with years of pservers, tuning content goes a long way to preserve the Vanilla experience with respect to difficulty.
---
Recently, on one of the big Vanilla Private Servers, a guild in BiS Naxx gear 10 Man’d Molten Core. It’s totally doable by less than 40, it’s just that the gear requirement ramps up significantly , requiring one exceptional player to do the jobs of 1 above average player and 4 stand in players.
---
As someone who's gf just downloaded a pserver and starting playing yesterday, I second this point hugely. She was having so much fun it was a friggin dream come true. I swear to god if some asshole wanna-be naxx raider chews her out in the Deadmines I'm gonna find them....
---
Being patient and kind goes a long way and makes everyone have more fun. End preachy mini-rant.
---
It is as its name suggests desolate, but more alive than it would seem. The centaur clans fighting over control of scarce resources made the zone feel real to me.
---
Depends on guild you find. Ours is pretty relaxed and we love showing off our veteran knowhow
---
I was a hunter and had the key, muahahahaha.
---
"Almost immediately"? I remember doing for months.
---
If you're running a WSG premade, then a high suitability hybrid. Down to Natures Swiftness in resto and then dump most the rest in feral. You can swing in Natures grasp (even one point) from balance to cap it off. 
---
Learn the flag routes and good luck!
---
Gets ban for grieving in 2019.
---
Best option?
---
- Create a bank alt toon and **don't log in** (10 seconds)
---
- mail all your shit to bank alt toon
---
- 10 days later, once you're 60, **and no longer in a rush**, log into said bank alt for the first time, check your mail, and dump it all into the bank.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZx0xoZVEfoeo0o
---
That's pretty close to your standard WSG flag carrier build. The high points are 3/3 Natural Shifting since you'll be spamming shifts to get out of snares, Feral Charge for the stun and mobility, and then NS and  Swiftmend for some insane self-healing.
---
&gt;I somewhat fear that this will translate into quite a hostile environment in-game for new players/people that haven't played vanilla since ... well... vanilla. 
---
Eh that's just WoW tbh.
---
Sometimes you'll run into people who are kind and help you along your way. 
---
Other times you lose a duel to a guy and he calls you trash and tells you to quit the game.
---
As a person who started in Cata I had quite a bit of the latter when I first started and expect more come Classic. You just gotta ignore those fuckers though.  
---
All you can do is try to have a positive impact and stand up for people if you see this kind of stuff going on and help people out when you can.
---
It sounds like your server is on Naxx. If thats the case you are correct. However Naxx is the raid that kinda ruins classic in my opinion.
---
Healing then was easier than healing now. If you enjoy it on retail then you’ll like it in classic.
---
It’s a stress test. The beta is there to test bugs, this is to test how the server handles an influx of players in the same place on a realm. You’ll get to play soon enough, stop whining that people are actually doing stuff and enjoying themselves because you can’t play. Chances are, you’d be fucking around if you got an invite too.
---
He's all in, he can't back off now.
---
Yeah losing all progress removes my interest from leveling honestly.
---
By not voting you are literally not doing anything that will make any change. By voting you could at least throw your vote towards someone for a chance at change. Even Mickey Mouse gets votes. You have the freedom to waste your chance to vote, it’s just really sad on a day like today, just a couple days after Memorial Day where we mourned those who died for our freedoms, that you would give up your own liberty of voting. On that note I’m out. You clearly think not voting will bring change faster than voting. Mine as well advocate flying planes into buildings because you don’t like people.
---
Ganking in Blackrock Mtn all day until raid time.

Alex Afrasiabi
---
Known as Furor Planedefiler in EverQuest. Google should return plenty of rants etc from the guy.
---
Richard! Lookit the smart guy!
---
Frank he's prolly speaking from experience.
---
Richard you can't wander into a raid with greens, right? Warriors especially, they' re so gear dependant!
---
Frank there os other stuff besides the dungeon sets...
---
Now YOU'RE bein' the smart guy! I see how it is!
---
Very true. Great point.
---
I played ESO for a moment and i though it was shit ;/
---
It will not. Kids wont be able to handle classic and soon go back to bfa for instant gratification, esport and all that crap
---
People wanted the vanilla experience. Up the damages values until only 0.01% of the players can kill Arugal
---
Good to hear. That wasn't added until TBC and I was hoping we would see it here. Sounds like we do.
---
There wasn't "Pugging" in vanilla. Raiding was heavily weighted on your guild raiding.
---
The closest thing you have is guilds that had alliances and would "borrow" plyers from other guilds. Also, raid leaders would keep lists of players in certain roles they might PM if they needed to fill spots.
---
11, had a like a level 6 green drop, walked to a main city and begged for enough money to learn the weapon skill only to toss it next level.
---
If you're EU then give me a shout, I don't know anyone that plays WoW anymore so finding some other WoW dads would be cool.
---
&gt; so what?
---
I didnt like it, you asked. You're not going to change my mind on a dungeon from 12 years ago. I'm glad you like it. Everyone has their favorite/least favorite
---
Not subbed and access to beta.
---
No, limitless. Only way to solo a worldboss was limitless stacks.
---
It took me like a year in real life to hit 60. But I eventually did. Full cleared MC &amp; BWL but my guild was average or less than average so we wiped a lot. Only killed NEf like 2-3 times while I was there. I only ever got 1 piece of Tier 2 :( although full tier 1. According to link below only  1% of players even raided at all. Which surprises me. But... hitting 60 is a task and honestly a lot of people didn't have the time or knowledge to do it. I think for the average player Vanilla will be fun and a different challenge than they're used to. For older players it will be easier now but I still think it will be really fun and I look forward to playing it again. Not sure if I will raid but if I do I look forward to it even if it not as hard as it used to feel.
---
Totally fair and unbiased poll to ask in Classic subreddit, where everyone seems to hate and hope the worse for retail
---
Then you wake up.
---
Well thought out! Thank you for the great detail.
---
I'm a vanilla vet that played a hunter through AQ40 - we dipped our toes into Naxx but never beat the first boss. During that time I played A LOT of alts and had friends that were great and I got to see a lot of other classes played at their peaks. So, below is obviously opinion and subject to memories from about 13 years ago. 
---
Regarding the 3 hybrids: Shaman, Druid, Paladin - It's entirely possible to find groups and raids that will accept you for whatever role you choose, but considering the thoughts you've already detailed, it's not ideal and will be the biggest challenge. A majority of players (albeit not all), especially coming from today's mindset of maximizing each position in a raid will want you to assist with heals. However, I genuinely think this will loosen over time. We have not had 40 man raids in a LONG TIME. Starting with the first 25 mans in BC, specs and classes for each role became incredibly more important and bred the current mindset - even moreso with the 10 mans.  
---
For PVP, you'll have great utility and they are incredibly fun classes to play. I wouldn't worry about these classes in that regard. There's a video on the front page of this sub with a druid in open world PVP, really great to watch. But, just like anything, the better you know your class and it's strengths/weaknesses the better you are in any situation for PVP.
---
If you want to play these classes, I say go for it! I feel that there's not going to be many of them, so be unique! 
---
Now, regarding your final point, my coveted hunter. I will be upfront that I have a lot of bias and a fond memories, but the one thing I can tell you is that you'll never be asked to heal (aside from bandages when you can). Also, I never had any issues with PVP, you have so many tools at your disposal that it's crazy. The biggest stand out for me was in my mix of T1/T2 gear with my Rok/Lok delar, I was destroying players but sometimes it was a lot of work. 
---
Story: Warlocks were some of the hardest to kill because of the dot/fear strategy. I remember the top warlock in our guild talking smack after a BG and saying no one could beat him. I think he went like 20+/0 or something in WSG. I told him I could, so he flew all the way to Burning Steppes where I was farming leather to have a duel. Let me tell you, there was an intimidation factor with his bravado, I mean he flew all they way to duel me.. So, heart pounding, hands starting to sweat, I knew I had to win or I'd never hear the end of it. Think about it, 38 other people we loved and cared about were about to raid within the next 24 hours - if he won after I challenged him, I would've gotten shit on for a minimum of a year, lol. So, he lands, I meet him at the FP and what proceeds was the HARDEST DUEL I HAVE EVER HAD. But, I beat him. Hand to god, I do not know how I pulled it off, but I smoked him with 75% of my hp. HE WAS LIVID, demanded a rematch and the whole spiel. Guild chat was off their rocker (we were on vent with others). It was AMAZING. Nothing compares to that moment, not even when I beat a 60 rogue at 48, beat paladins outside IF (bubble was a bitch), nothing. That single moment set me up for life and I've never had a match like that one. 
---
Moving on, you mentioned that you were worried about hunter's getting spots in raids, and here's my view on that. At any given time in vanilla we had 4-7 hunters in a raid with 4 being our minimum. Tranq shot was a large part of that and as we all know how raiding is even now (outside of the elite), is that a lot of people still "stand in the fire". So, relying on players to pay enough attention to maintain their position in the tranq rotation is a challenge and adding additional hunters to extend your reach on that is helpful. The other advantage to bringing hunters is pulling because hunters had Feign Death which made it easier on the tanks. You would unload as much threat into the target as possible to build up the initial threat meter and bring it to your tank and then Feign Death and they would assume that position in threat. It was immensely helpful and started the fights more swiftly as there was less wait time for the tank to establish aggro. 
---
Anyway, I can't decide for you, but I hope sharing my experiences and opinions will give you more depth of understanding how it is in Vanilla and helps you make a decision. 
---
The final point I would like to leave you that's gotten me through every expansion's forum and discussions is this: the most vocal are the minority. Think about your favorite restaurant and then consider yelp and restaurant reviews. The people that respond to those are generally (not a rule) people with extreme experiences, either extremely good or extremely bad. The folks that tend to just enjoy it don't usually take the time to pull up and respond or post about it. So, as you go through the forums and reddit, remember that a lot of the complaints and conjecture about how raids will be are not the mass mindset of what you're going to experience. Will there be elitist guilds and raids? Absolutely, they will always be in any game. But, there are also casual experiences to be had. Do not make a decision based on fear of missing out based on something you read here. 
---
Hope this helps and I look forward to seeing you in the game!
---
Dungeons has minimum level thresholds.
---
I levelled a priest like without talents, I took some crappy talents in holy disc and shadow instead of going full shadow. Almost never used my wand and when I hit 60 I respecced shadow. Then went on to farm full dreadmist and stepped into molten core to be like the 10the guild on the server to clear it after a few months. Don’t think my guild had heard about debuff limit since they brought me along as shadow. Then i moved server for free due to long queue on shattered hand and on frostmane started pvping premades, to r13 as healbot for Druid. Then I went on to raid bwl and aq40, never cleared Cthun and naxx spider wing only. Looking back I didn’t know shit what I was doing.
---
I remember watching this exact post blow up on the old forums in real time. Surreal.
---
Bonus throwback to when they first added the holy power UI: ["my dangle glows and I hate it"](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/8704690527). (Not the atual thread but someone dug up the full text of it).
---
&gt;They would have made druids, paladins and shaman viable tanks to go along with warrior.  
---
&gt;I'm all about no changes, this is just a theoretical idea.
---
Read that one more time.
---
Where i can find information on how sharding in calssic will work.  Im worried, since one of the things i hate in modern wow i sharding. Id like to know more.
---
SOCIAL interaction + video MEDIA = Social Media.... Sorry bro....
---
I really don't understand all the complaining about sharding and layering.
---
Sure, it's going to compromise the authenticity for a week or two, but its either that or we get a repeat of the WoD launch.
---
Neither one is desirable, but I can say, with 100% confidence, what most people would prefer.
---
PvP specs were enough to do decently in raid. Damage checking is about rooting out slackers.
---
And LOL at the entitlement of thinking they had to fund your respecs every week.
---
Imagine playing whack a mole with the tanks, and then buffing others. There, you've got it. :)
---
You get assignments
---
And because it's 40 man unless there is soak you just spam the same spell over and over
---
If you're assigned to a tank maybe as druid you'd HoT. Or in other scenarios where teh tank was taking too much damage for mana efficient casts to heal through. There will only be one renew priest again outside soak mechanics. Where you would give assigns and things would be organized.
---
Healing is the hardest to play fame perfect from a theoretical perspective, but if you have more healers than you need or they're all very good it can also be your individual play makes teh least difference throughout a raid.
---
Tanks and DPS aren't doing things in concert with 8 other people while simultaneously trying to perfectly downrank. lol
---
You would expect your tanks and dps to near frame perfect in a boss encounter in a good guild. 
---
Never your healers
---
When you go past an arcade, are you drawn to the whack a mole game?
---
Just got one of those today! Yeah, it was unfortunately $600, but hopefully worth it.
---
Its Ouroboros!
---
My 39 twink was capped at first sergeant and that was rank 5 I believe and I think there's another break point in the 30s so knock off a level and 4 would be the current cap.
---
my b
---
Why would you watch the fight? You just watch the healthbars + decursive + potion timer + your own feet.
---
There are many vanilla raid bosses that I never looked at until they were corpses. You play the healer minigame in boss fights; it has nothing to do with all the pretty flashes and ugly monsters.
---
red shirt guy embarrassed this guy 2 blizzcons in a row. no I guess that's why they havent allowed him to asks questions recently.
---
As a healer you will never be responsible to heal 40 people. You will be given a packet of targets you are responsible for and an expanded packet of targets if another healer goes down. Healers should never have standing orders to FFA heal 40 people. The cream dream for laziness is to heal the MT. Paladins are universally about this job lol.
---
Doing a 40 man raid is about breaking down roles into bite sized digestible pieces. Any guild that doesn't do this will fail.
---
I think there are lots of people who were not initially excited for classic. Most of whom are dead.....
---
Legendary post and to be fair I don't mind if people repost it almost weekly because there have been so many new people here in the last few weeks from what I've noticed, some of them who maybe haven't even played WoW or they started way later, so they don't know about gems like this one.
---
I’m gonna go axe spec while leveling to craft weapons for myself the whole time. I want to craft the Annihilator before I’m done.
---
Im all for it. Numbers is all they need to really change. Id be fine with TBC class balance.
---
My favorite memories are leveling in The Barrens. The chat there was always so active sometimes for better/worse.
---
My second favorite memory is probably being in Stranglethorn doing world PVP. Having my dad /afk in the road while I stayed stealthed nearby to gank people.
---
I Love all the follow up posts and images in this thread. Thanks for sharing! I wish my vanilla pictures were half as good as these.
---
Well there are healers assigned to specific groups, unless you are in charge of topping everyone off or is shit hits the fan, you won't have to worry about 40 people all at once.
---
For a basic summary of how they play out in endgame pve:
---
Priests are generally the best class for healing, being able to raid heal and tank heal with relative ease depending on spec.
---
Druids are much more versatile and utility, but they can't quite raid heal, and warriors outclass them as tanks most of the time, but that's not to say they cannot tank, just requires a lot more effort and a guild willing to work with it.
---
Druid dps was common enough back in my day, no idea how people will approach it now, but I imagine you'd have a lot more success finding and keeping a raid group as a healer.
---
Just watched the vids.
---
That indeed is NOT a vanilla mechanic and needs to be removed. Great work providing those clips. Players should never be getting this free ghost range by simple moving.
---
Enjoy dude, I've loved this thing since I got it. 165hz when you can run it is crazy.
---
Play the game?
---
Please don't give them ideas.
---
center was ally vs horde npcs and trolls would invade from the mountains towards center and control the graveyard. over time trolls would overwhelm the center and take over and korrak would spawn at the 2hr mark. 
---
I do agree its sad they went with 1.12 version, as it removes a lot of fun things about av, but because fun is subjective it also remove some of the annoying things about it too for some people. 
---
Im just saying 24hr games are still gonna happen. and 10min games are still going to happen. Id even argue that even if it was 1.5av 10 min games would still happen more often than 24 hr games. problably even more often than 2hr games. Players decide how long the game lasts with how they play. Truth is most people want 5min games because they want to reap the rewards.
---
TL;DR for the ultra lazy: mean green man grinds players into dust with fast firey stick.
---
I always like Trifal glades and Hammerfall.  UnGoro Crater was always fun for me too.
---
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105735-wow-classic-testing-access-as-of-may-22/
---
Bottom post. This shows that it is possible.
---
I dont want it in the game, the thread isnt about making a change, its about asking the question. if these changes  where made in 2004. would vanilla be the best expansion even though it's not an expansion.
---
To discount the leveling experience to someone trying to gauge a class's merit is not telling the whole story and thus not answering their question. The poster asked for pros and cons on PvP and PvE. Getting gear while leveling, a huge part of the game, is not as difficult as in endgame. There's a lot of game before 60, friend.
---
CD keys are the best bet to recover an account.  When my mom was hacked thats how we got her account back.
---
And god damn I’ll exercise my right to!
---
Its possible, but who knows how it would've impacted endgame progression for everyone. If you look at TBC even when certain classes had gear designed for them they still weren't amazing. Pally tanks were awesome in dungeons but for raiding Warriors and druids were still better in terms of raw mitigation.
---
Gonna have trouble finding a Pally and Shaman in the same raid in Classic
---
I mean to be fair I doubt a lot of people will use it because of the ‘difficulty’ of the content.
---
I'm not in the beta, but played Vanilla and TBC.  A lot of what they are describing is what I felt back in the day.  I don't think it's just because they are streamers or because it's the beta.  I think it's because they game was designed in a way that fosters interaction between players.
---
I think a lot of people will struggle with orchestrating 40 people successfully.
---
I still remember how ridiculous Vaelastrasz and Chromaggus were when people weren't on the same page and the gear wasn't quite there.
---
Un'goro should really be on my list too. When I was a teenager I had my tonsils taken out. I got to stay home from school a whole week leveling in Un'goro hahaha, still remember that, was a pretty awesome week!
---
Walking into Dusk Wood at lvl 12 with my dwarf hunter.  Mobs were dead so I got pretty far in.   Place scared me then every thing started respawning.  Ran half way across the zone and managed to hide in the top floor of the Raven Hill graveyard house.  
---
Finally escaped back to Elwyn Forest and vowed to face Dusk Wood when I was high enough level for it.
---
It was one of those "shit just got real" moments.
---
It became Common quality in TBC:
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Head_of_the_Broodlord_Lashlayer&amp;oldid=798684
---
This 2007 page still has it as Epic in the Tooltip (along with the flavour text), and this comment was added:
---
&gt;With TBC this item is lootable for all in raid and its Common (quality).
---
I dont know if you have played on vanilla pservers recently (last 3years) but honestly, I dont know more friendly, chilled and patient playerbase. Exceptions will be there, but you have ignore list for them, so all is good
---
Such insight
---
Unfortunately, when I’m not so discrete about my business, my comments get “involuntarily liquidated”.
---
I agree. I think TBC class balance is the best. WotLK was a bit too homogenized already, plus dual spec and other crappy stuff.
---
You'll likely be assigned to a limited number of folks when it comes to raiding. If you're raid healing you'll either be on melee dps healing duty or ranged dps healing duty in addition to decursing or dispelling. If you're tank healing, you have 1 person to focus on so it's really not that bad. The real challenge is learning your mana management + downranking and when to use certain abilities like shields, root, shackle, totems, blessings, etc. A raid bars addon that allows you to break out groups and move people's health bars around will help you out greatly.
---
The only streamer I ever followed, what a guy
---
I will play im just not gonma suck its dick. This is still blizzard
---
I'm kind of in a similar boat. I'm waiting to hear from my friends what they are going to do before deciding, but I'm rolling around priest, druid, warrior, hunter... From what I can tell they need a tank/warrior, so I'll be happy to fill that spot. If there are no druids, though, I'm happy to do that too... 
---
As far as polls and what classes will be popular and shit, I wouldn't stress it too much. If you want to be a competitive raider/pvper, you'll put in the work you need to be what you want, no matter what spec/class. That said, unusual/meme builds require a lot more effort/convincing to make work... but that can be more fun :P
---
Like that was actually needed.
---
Agree.
---
Any source on that?  SS is an instant attack and instant attacks proc windfury generally and I don't see or remember anything about a special exception for stormstrike.
---
Was 19 good ol times
---
Pre-raid BiS man HoJ is BiS until AQ40 and even then its still equiped simply because the trinket you want to drop never does.
---
I'm not asking for a change. simply asking with these changes would vanilla be the best expansion.
---
Thought I was gonna play a druid again. Now I'm gonna play a priest cause I want a new adventure
---
Pservers people prefer 18-19+. Classic will be more lenient as 15+. 
---
However, stress test questions require stress test solutions. Bring on the lv 10 twink runs!
---
No. I guess there are many reasons why people get add-ons to make the game easier: competitiveness being one of the most important aspects. Combine that with an just about average skill level (leading to the inability to set oneself apart by skill), self esteem that relies on comparison to others, low frustration tolerance e.g. generally low emotional self control.The most obvious route is then to install atlas, enemy cast bars and all that the add-ons that make the game easier for you. Plus you research every other aspect online and voilà you successfully eliminated most of the topics where you:
---
would have to memorize stuff, figure out on your own, think about strategies, get a feel for the game, try unconventional things and so on.
---
I don't mind. Some people are just overburdened by the complexity of the information, but still want to feel good about themselves, so they look for addons to make the game easier. In other games there are cheats. And some of the pvp add-ons, as well as macros are cheats imo.
---
They knew back then as well. And just as 15 years before, it is about communicating with your guild mates.
---
watching asmongold, i learned that miner johnson basically means “small penis”
---
thank you!
---
We just down Cthun, naxx is only out in August but I probably wont join and just wait for official servers.
---
No friends for me, so it's solely my choice. Lately I've been thinking about controlling groups as a warrior, getting to mark CC xcetera. And then when I think mage, I have to think about all the other classes I have to compete with for gear.
---
As of right now, I am slightly leaning more towards Warrior first then mage
---
Wasn't there something east of stonehearth bunker that got removed? Maybe it was the area a little north and there is just no reason left to go there anymore but I feel like there used to be a bunch of faction neutral hostile mobs somewhere on the eastern side of the map that aren't there anymore
---
As for the rest of your post, you're probably right. It's a mentality thing to ignore the enemy faction for a quick honor reap. When did people unlearn to have fun and place rewards over gameplay?
---
I can't speak to priest, I've never made it past 10 with one. However, I can tell you that if you're going pally you can level ret and just toss heals as you need them. Between you and a warrior it won't take much to kill anything. 
---
That will open up your RP advantage with the options, like you mentioned. Additionally, since you mentioned Naxx and a desire to do so, I know you also realize that you'll be wearing a mix of cloth and other such gear to maximize your healing on said HPally. So, if that doesn't bother you, I'd say go for it. But, if you think you'll regret it or miss your priest, Warr/Priest combos are also nigh unstoppable just from my experience. 
---
Additional thought regarding Pally/Warr combo for leveling is that your husband and you will be competing for gear. Whereas the priest would auto get the cloth and your hubby would get the plate. So, there's an added advantage there.
---
Why do people even care about beta it’s gonna be wiped in a few weeks anyways
---
100 days/year?
---
Should crosspost this to /r/screenshotofameme
---
Being excited for a game? Looking back at something fondly?? THE HORROR
---
I’ll almost miss it. Salt from ganking a rank3 29 twink was amazing. Like sure buddy, you’re looking for a fair fight in 21-22 ashenvale.
---
You can stop squinting now ;)
---
* Heavy Frost Mage (17 in Arcane for Imp CS)

I'm at work so that's the quick and dirty. Want 5 more?
---
21/30/0 is the cookiecutter for healers. Ill drop a few examples when im not on my phone.
---
I rolled Horde originally and I am planning to roll Alliance this time. So actually I'm looking forward to playing through Duskwood, Redshire and some of the other Alliance Eastern Kingdom zones that I never really saw before Cataclysm hit.
---
Except Stranglethorn vale. F that place.
---
What classes in particular are good for that? I'm planning on playing a priest, but I'm not sure if Holy Nova is going to be a good enough AOE to be useful. Not to mention, I'm squishy as hell.
---
My favorite moment was when i was questing in nelf zones and my “buddy” led me to dun morogh and logged out. Having no idea how to get back or wtf hs was, i had to create a new character. Fuck that guy, went straight to my ignore list.
---
As you can see people who started playing in cata and beyond dont like the idea of skill being implement in muh button mashing game!
---
It’s funny Bc these class specs aren’t even that bad in dungeons. I’ve ele shammed ubrs and healed on heavy resist mobs for an extremely quick run. I’ve also done the same as an SP. Stop blowing things out of proportion.
---
Important note: avoid that kind of shitty guild. Even if one guy did 5% more damage than the rest, he is still only represents a tiny amount of the sum of the total DPS.
---
Avoid guilds that seek and reward elitism, and try to stick with those that understand the team notion.
---
Nice
---
Druid is more versatile for both pvp and raids, whereas paladins are often pretty grouped up in protadins and holydins. Ret pallies exist for sure, but there is a reason they aren't as popular as they became in BC/Wrath... many reasons.
---
Have you tried the playstyle for both classes? I played druid a bit at 60 and really enjoyed healing, but cat form always pissed me off, I didn't understand how to make it work (compared to my previous experience as a rogue, it was familiar, but I still hated it).
---
I enjoyed prot and holy paladin as well, but I never raided seriously at 60 as a paladin, I don't even think my paladin hit 60 before TBC.
---
Vanilla has:
---
* 4 keys that let you skip part of a dungeon
---
* 2 keys that let you summon bonus bosses
---
* 3 keys that open a dungeon (all pickable)
---
* 4 raid attunements
---
TBC has:
---
* 5 dungeon keys/quests
---
* 1 dungeon that requires flying mount
---
* heroics required revered with the instance's faction
---
All of the Vanilla raid attunements were 5-man dungeon clear quests.
---
The TBC raid attunements were heavy quest chains that required 25-man raid kills, some of them timed.
---
I have been avoided it and didn't bother trying to get into the beta for this very reason.
---
I wanna ride that nostalgia wave as long as I can before I settle in.
---
SM Cathedral was great for this. Pull everything and then LoS the mobs in the first tunnel and AoE them down. Super quick runs and great XP/loot.
---
You won’t find a lot of critical thought in this sub unfortunately, and I know I'll be downvoted to shit for daring to have a different opinion. People are pretty deep into the no changes circlejerk. I agree with you to a certain extent though. Why not try to make the best version of Vanilla wow they can?
---
In vanilla, blizzard was new to running and sustaining an MMO. Now they have the advantage of knowing all the outcomes of their balance and content changes.
---
With the advantage of literally knowing the future meta game with 100% accuracy along with all the shortcomings and problems...why not make it a healthier, more balanced and varied game while still following the design principals, content, and spirit of original WoW?
---
But a lot of people would rather ride the nostalgia wave than experience something that could be better, if either to preserve their sacred memories, or in fear that Blizzard would mess it up.
---
Do I think Vanilla as it was is better than modern WoW? Yes. Way better.
---
Was Vanilla WoW perfect? Fuck no. Not even close. It had an incredible amount of balance and design problems, particularly in the late game raid meta. I'm open to the potential, but most people aren't.
---
If you lvl your 'bank' to 35, you've got access to max lvl prof. Pretty awesome for transmute arcanite bars and mooncloths.
---
I am conflicted between a Priest and Mage.
---
I played a priest all of WOTLK and absolutely loved it. I love healing and I really enjoyed shadow. I was really big into pvp as a disc priest because of all the disc priest utility. 
---
I rolled a mage and casually played the panda expansion. I really liked the utility I had as a frost mage. I never got into pvp with the mage and mostly just did dungeons. 
---
I guess I'm just thinking out loud because I know I want to play a UD priest in classic. Just caught up as I'm playing a mage on a pserver and really enjoying leveling.
---
Dumb and gay.
---
My first account was when the game was first released. Soon to be stolen by my older brother. Made a new account, by the end of vanilla I had cleared MC/ZG/AQ20 but that was it. I was never in a hardcore guild, I was also like 13-14 at the time. My brother did however raid naxx up to Kt but I don’t believe he killed him. They did kill saph while he was current. My brother used to rank on a lot of world of logs fights as a warrior, ended vanilla with T3. Pretty sure he doesn’t browse reddit, and I know for a fact he won’t be playing classic because he “already beat it.”
---
That said I doubt many of the people here have actually cleared vanilla naxx. My brother used to stay awake until 3-4am on school nights to raid. He is only 2 years older than I am. It was doable, but you had to grind and play all the time. I don’t recall him ever farming world buffs either. He did have a few sets of gear for all the resistances and tanking 4 horsemen. He hasn’t been playing much the past few xpacks, but if any warrior has ever seen Dragonsfang from Khadgar on world of logs, you’d know he was a beast. Pretty sure he was top 5 Neff in Heroic BWD. He suicided during several attempts trying to max out that mind control damage debuff.
---
Nice you made a low effort meme into an even lower effort meme good lad
---
If youre casual I highly recommend you dont base your choice around the t3 set as youre most likely never going to have any. 
---
Naxx is heavy time consumming only to be able to raid it. Tier2 is a lot more realistic.
---
U go shaman n press chain heal
---
It's titan panel
---
I don't have patch notes but, I can tell you for sure that is how it works. By this patch It won't proc off SS and, has a 3 second internal cool down. If you don't wanna believe me. I would at least recommend doing an investigation of your own before picking the class. At this point in the game. Enhance might be the worst spec in the game. Your not even a good NF carrier. If it's not the worst, looking at you boomkin. It's certainly in the running. 
---
They nerfed Shamans into the dirt in anticipation of giving them a rework. One that didn't come until TBC. 1.12 is by far the weakest incarnation of the shaman class. That being said if you get gear. Ele/Resot, can still be a monster in pvp. In pve, your life is chain heal and providing others with WF totem.
---
i'm not googling pussy cult. can you explain what that even means? lol
---
JUST WAIT FOR THE REAL THING. HIT THE GYM GET IN GOOD SHAPE. SAVE UP MONEY BE READY FOR THE RELEASE. A MAJORITY OF YOU PEOPLE SAYING ARHGHH NO BETA ARE IN BAD SHAPE HIT THE GYM.
---
I know everyone allegedly clicked back then but I don't think so. I don't remember ever having a problem with rogues as a warrior even ones geared heavy. I would take some damage in a stun then utilize war stomp. In fact I used to take rogues out of stealth with it when I heard them, then the tables become turned because I throw a dot on them and keep them stunned, plus I had unstoppable force so my weapon would stun a lot of rogues. My problem PvP wise was being too young to handle casters and hunters wisely. The only class that gave me a problem melee was paladins and every time i get the edge they bubble and hearth.
---
That's another one I was looking at too. I'm not partial to either faction, I just wanna know how self sufficient I'll be at 60 when I need to be lol
---
With the new laws coming in porn torrents will welcome us all back with open arms!
---
No, don't give a shit, do whatever you want. 
---
Frankly I always preferred NE rogues because of the inherent better stealth with the shadowmeld bonus. I didn't have to put as many points into Sub for it and it allowed me to get closer to my targets. But, a get out of jail card with the gnome racial is pretty amazing too.
---
38 and lost in Silverpine.
---
Staying loyal. Human warrior because I’m basic. But this time around I won’t be a 11 year old snot, and actually understand how to do things. Like sunder.
---
There is no sharding in Classic. There is a new technology called layering.
---
There is a podcast called “Countdown to Classic” where in episode #105 they had on Kevin Jordan, former Blizzard developer, and he explains layering from his perspective as an expert in the field. He does a way better job of explaining the tech behind it and how it works than anyone else I’ve heard so far. I highly recommend the podcast in general to any vanilla lovers and that episode specifically for anyone curious about the layering tech.
---
One thing that crafting profs can do is help you gear up though. Going through the leveling process on a private server reminded me how little gear you actually get. Having a profession to give you some basic greens will actually help a ton, especially if you can keep it up. You already need to grind for levels so you might as well grind for the mats to make useful gear. You can also sell these on the AH for a decent price. Gear like leather +agil/stam and mail +str/stam will make a killing with tons of rogues and warriors around.
---
A lot of people seem to forget that Vanilla had a LFG tool made by Blizzard. It was released before TBC and didn't teleport you or allow cross-realm. Those were the two features a lot of people hated.
---
100% spliced.
---
VC run? Played in vanilla and pservers as well as retail since current (on/off) am I brain farting or is this like a 30 meta obscure rare spawn called VC?
---
Bankrolling an alt doesn't make it a whole lot faster though. It's definitely helpful and noticeably more convenient, but it only saves time on fights and recovering between fights with no benefit to the massive amount of time we need to allot for traveling and all non combat tasks. People keep citing world record leveling times, but most players will still take 8-10 days to hit 60 since rushing to 60 takes FAR more than just following an optimized progression path. With a bankrolled character it's going to turn into maybe 6-8 days, and that would require a lot of bankrolling. Most of the leveling experience isn't combat and recovering, it's
---
We’ll be able to go home soon ;)
---
Ole PvP titles are our proof.
---
Yeah, this gets to me. Like, am I jealous of this gear? Heck yeah I am.
---
But come one. You're trying to tell me that a person sunk *thousands* of hours into achieving and obtaining all this, the literal end-game of the literal hardest content ever, only to "stop" and somehow lose access to his account?
---
Yeah, no. Either sold it or created a new one, which again wouldn't really make sense because you'd WANT to keep this one and all the things in it.
---
Either way, it's good that OP is coming back to Classic, either real or fake. We need more people onboard on this sum'bitch!
---
No. Being subbed doesn’t mean anything. I wasn’t subbed and got an invite. You have a set is goal posts you think should qualify for an invite, and then there is someone with more hours, older account, etc that feels more entitled. I’m hyped for classic but have no urge to burn myself on the game 3 months before launch.
---
I may have been on my bear during that time helping tank, Ihate. I have a video somewhere of us killing Anub 10m, I'll see if I can find it
---
?? Dude if you thought the issue was needing the key or charge, you don't know what you're talking about lol. The issue is getting past the guards and dropping aggro lmao.
---
Attack speeds weren’t normalized until 2.0.3.
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
I played shaman through vanilla, cleared AQ40 and a bit of naxx in a 30/0/21 (elemental/nature's swiftness) spec. 
---
I fully understood that the majority of fights I would be needed to heal. Sometimes in AQ20/ZG/MC I was able to fuck around and dps, but only because the rest of the group knew me, knew my ability, and still wanted me there.
---
We didn't have a dedicated boomkin or shadow priest or ele shaman or whatever.... but as the fights dictated you could mess around with some hybrid specs. If you walk  into a PUG as a hybrid expecting not to do any healing whatsoever, you'd better make that crystal clear from the get go. Flexibility is the key - if you want to play an enhance shaman in raids, be prepared to pay the costs of healing a good portion.
---
This is talking about stress test 1 characters transferring over to stress test 2...
---
&gt; I will be there!!! I mean i had 6 level 5 characters the last go round. Lets see how many i can get to 10! haha.
---
&gt;  Also is there any confirmation if those characters are going to carry over? Or will it be a fresh wipe. Understand if we do not know those details yet. But figured i would ask.
---
yes that's true but besides the druid flight for quest was there class quests for the others I cant remember. the quest lines for the legendarys was also better imo. dont get me wrong I rank tbc as the best expansion but I think vanilla had some flavor that was lost. also the crafting specializations.
---
When non vanilla players try to meme vanilla.
---
Someone give this man a CFO position!
---
Druids are meat shields with very good AoE threat abilities in 5-man settings. That said, with a leveling spec and 2 sets of gear (1 for healing, 1 for not), a Druid has the flexibility to play every role while leveling. Your first run of Wailing Caverns might be as a healer, but you can turn around and immediately do another as a tank or even DPS simply by swapping gear.
---
This isn't specific to dungeons, but is where you see it exemplified. You have the toolset to do almost anything you want on demand, and a ton of utility to boot  That's what I really love about Druids in Classic.
---
Can't speak to pallies, but that's my Druid pitch.
---
r/hedidthemath
---
Stay strong brother. I applaud the cause. I try to avoid it as much as possible as well.
---
Druids are viable they just arent going to be raid MT. Paladins don't deserve anything. They are already the most OP support in the game. If you buff tanking for them. Your buffing the most OP support in the game. You can fuck off with that.If we were to have changes. Class already needs to be hit with the nerf bat. Either way #nochanges.
---
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with it if that’s what you enjoy. As someone who’s done high end raiding and pvp, I really don’t care about being “good” anymore. I want a world to move through and interact with. But that certainly doesn’t mean I’m trying to downplay the people that want to be the best. If that’s what you want to do, I hope you get to be the best damn player out there
---
It's actually a melee survival hunter who wears Int Mail and RP's as a half-dragon, half-elf, half-human shaman who was trained by Kael'thas before he left the Alliance.
---
“Already in use.”
---
Yes, it's fairly simple atm because I couldn't find a lot of science behind it but it does take parries into account.
---
You might like to do some world pvp on occasion.
---
Hahaha that's hilarious. It seemed like the end of the world at that time, too. Because I did the same thing on my Orc and went to EK
---
It is! And the live version is SO much better then the pserver trash. I hope you enjoy!
---
In that list, I would keep Frost mage, MS warrior and Disc priest only if it's a dwarf. 
---
So no, no 5 better specs.
---
Funny you mention clicking. My brother used to click abilities and he actually did naxx up to KT. 😂
---
Ppl told me that the proc is splittet within 2 swings.. So 1 Proc of to procs with the first swing and the second proc of the procs with the next swing. O.o
---
Nice thanks!
---
Think the meme is supposed to be all Warriors care about in dungeons is people not rolling on their gear, with HoJ not being reserved for the run.
---
So you were a Rogue?
---
*Cracks knuckles*
---
VanCleef? Spelling? I get people call it DM but back in the day on Illidan server we called Deadmines VC.
---
Love the YouTube content 👌🏻
---
People tanking 5 elites while not wearing a shield was simply not possible in Vanilla. Has nothing to do with "players being better now".
---
I think from a gear/competition standpoint, warrior/tank is easily one of the best choices. I remember waiting ages to queue as a dps... No thanks, started playing my tank/healer more often.
---
If you KNOW you love a dps class/spec and want to spend your time working on being the best you can at that, more power to you. I'll take the road of convenience if I feel like it.
---
I switched over to my ret paladin full time near the end of TBC/beginning of wrath, and I remember having to compete for the last 10 man heroic raid slot with a hunter. The guild was really not on board with bringing on another melee dps (me), but the utility I brought, combined with my better damage, got me the spot. I went on to compete for top damage spots the rest of Wrath in that guild. Good memories, and I'd commit to that level of DPS focus again, but I kind of want to be the one on the hook for wipes via healing/tanking this time around. Different sorts of glory.
---
The question is, how? I don't want it to boil down to "Make all dps deal the same dps" or "Give all tanks similar toolkits and equal survivability." That's boring and leads to homogenization.
---
That’s crazy you said that. Been trying to play my games on Xbox One like usual but just wasnt feeling it... Instead, I just watch Soda and Asmond whenever I get the chance
---
VC = deadmines for some.
---
You don't world pvp on a twink. Twinks are made for battlegrounds. You might occasionally go outside of a major city and do some 1v1's but absolutely not world pvp.
---
There are level 60's out there. They're scary.
---
I wont have consistent time to play and therefore serious raiding is out of the question. I am between: **Warrior, Rogue, Druid (Happy to flex roles: Tank, Heals, DPS), Priest (healing).**
---
My priorities are:
---
1. PVP (Premade and pug BG's)
---
2. 5 Mans 
---
3. World PVP
---
4. Pug Raids
---
5. Eventually a Raid Guild
---
I don't like struggling to find groups, i like to pick up and go therefore being an '**in demand class**' is also a priority for the above. Based on me not being able to raid a lot, i would like to know which of those classes are able to perform well with **Rank 10 and 5 man gear** vs. fully decked out. Also as I didn't play vanilla at max level it would be interesting to know if **I need to re-spec if i switch between PVP and PVE**.
---
TLDR: Choosing between Warrior, Rogue, Druid, Priest and did my best to bold important info.
---
Thanks in advance for the feedback!
---
I remember exploring and running north from Orgrimmar and went into Azshara and my ass cheeks clenched when I saw the ?? Naga
---
I'm not asking for a change I'm asking had these changes been done in 2004 from the get go would vanilla be the best expansion released.
---
THats always been the issue with every F2P game.  Also, if a person has been asked to buy in, they will likely be retained. If you show a game has no value, then people dont value the game.  Thats sales 101.
---
Lmao ok I've never seen anyone use mind control cap like that, but you know that has a high failure rate and a 30 min cooldown right? So even if that is blizzlike, which I'm pretty sure its not, you might get 1 run done an hour lmao
---
Yeah but you had to go to the closest innkeeper iirc.
---
I’m on a private server playing at 15x xp and I’m in the mid 30s and it’s starting to feel grindy.  I can’t imagine how slow it’s going to be at 1x. I guess I forgot.
---

---
Check this out lots of juicy wallpapers
---
There's a big level difference there you're leaving out... no?  The mobs should be hitting a level 30 much harder than the 40+
---
Lupos was fixed in 1.9.
---
Just an FYI. Rank 10 takes a large time commitment. Casual raiding will probably net more gear per time spent. This is even more true post zg / Nax
---
Install the add-on name "Census Plus" and let it run like once a day during peak time for a whole week.
---
Do this on different private servers if you want to be more accurate.
---
Now watch the class repartition at level 60. You now have some stats way more realistic than any bullshit poll you may see here and there.
---
Spoiler, it should be more or less something like this pretty much *everywhere* : Mage/warrior &gt; rogue &gt; hunt &gt;&gt; warlock/priest/shaman/paladin &gt;&gt;&gt; druid.
---
u/joshcorbo82  This needs reading out in your next calling countdown segment, I read this with the accent of Danny Dyer and cant get it out my head now.
---
lol just tried to play a hunter for a bit on pserver. This happened more times than I expected :D
---
I never claimed in doesn't help you. I'm claiming that it just doesn't "play your character" or trivialize your gameplay.
---
&gt;Of course people are free to use whatever addons they please and I have no problem with it, **so long as they acknowledge it provides them an advantage that players without the addon don't have.**
---
Lmao, why? Every single player has the same capabilities of using the same addon. There's no exclusion here. Does everyone have to announce before a duel, "Guys, I'm using an swing timer. I just need to let you know that I have an advantage over you hardcore players who don't use addons. I'm acknowledging that I'm not as good as a player as YorkeZimmer."
---
&gt;That's fine if that's how you want to play, just acknowledge that you aren't naturally outperforming other players in the same position without the addons that mess up the execution of one of those things.
---
You clearly do care if others use it since you were originally trying to seek validation for not using addons. And you're making it sound like people need to just acknowledge to themselves they're inferior players if they use them. You make it seem like this is one huge contest to find out who's the best player and who has the most skill. Dude its a videogame from 2004, just chill and let people play how they wanna play.
---
You clearly overvalue the idea of everything being "natural". Like what does that even mean and how far are you willing to take it? Do you believe players need to acknowledge that if they're using a mechanical keyboard over a membrane? More buttons on your mouse? Better framerate? It's such a silly thing to complain about.
---
The level 60 epic hunter quest is my favorite. You have to get an item from one of the last bosses of MC and Onyxia and then go kill a handful of difficult demons for a staff and bow. I remember watching tons of videos on prepping and how to fight the demons in preparation.
---
I had a 7800GT, played CSGO until it died in 2016
---
Pretty sure a Warrior Paladin combo duo'd Ony in Vanilla.
---
Warrior with a healer is amazing. You can take on multiple mobs and do a lot of damage because all the rage you generate from those mobs hitting you. In end game PvE you can choose to tank or DPS. A rogue can only DPS.
---
Druid and rogue are also a great combo, being stealth classes. You can pull off a lot fun shenanigans with them in both PvE and PvP. 
---
I don't think I'm helping, both seem really fun.
---
Where are you seeing wall jumping no longer working? I just saw sodapoppin do wall jumping in the beta the other day
---
&gt;What I am saying is that the sentiment in the thread title is misleading players who might be new to a pre-dual spec game. If you want to play a role without the proper tools, it won't be long until you're replaced by someone who does have the proper tools.
---
And you should add that this is only true in deeply elitist/try-hard guilds, those who place no value on human relationships at all. 
---
Those exists, God knows it, but they aren't necessarily the rule either. Even in top guilds this isn't necessarily true.
---
I remember wiping on Smite and VC back in the day, and using the 'jump on the barrel thing trick' (on top of the ship) to have mobs evade healers and whatnot. But that is a group of lvl 15s who had played the game for only a few weeks.
---
*laughs in stunlock*
---
You're not wrong. Even Sergeant on a warrior twink is very dear to me.
---
Officer / RL assist here
---
Generally those who underperform and dont want to be helped to improve get replaced.
---
So I rolled into Razor Hill and was instantly impressed. Houses, trades-orcs, trainers, tons of stuff to do. "This is great" I thought, "I wonder if there are other towns this big."
---
Then one guy gave me a package and told me to take it to a place called "Orgrimmar". Well I came out of the canyon in front of the Org main gate and I was like "Oh."
---
Really with that combo you could do anything.  In pvp mages are great for control, especially at keeping mele of your warlock.  They are also great for CC in dungeons.  Warrior is good for dungeons obviously because tanks are hard to get.  But you may also want to just roll a hybrid class for heals.  You can't go wrong.
---
I just wouldn't roll a warrior for pvp unless you plan to pick up a 4th for heals/dispel.
---
I didn't see the fights on my druid until she could solo vanilla raids a few expansions later.
---
I'm thinking he may be confusing the Stalvan questline with the Mor'ladim questline. Even then, the 2h sword you get from that quest is pretty good (it's not too slow or two fast, has a proc) but it's not as good as Verigan's Fist.
---
Yeah, hindsight is 20/20. There's a lot if stuff I've lost over the years as well.
---
I don't get this... You're saying you can't tell if you went from 4000 to 5000, but you can if you went from 400 to 500?
---
I may not have time to fully dedicate to raiding. So I'll be doing a lot of solo content, dungeons, and pvp. Hopefully raiding when it permits.
---
I'm stuck between druid and mage. 
---
I played druid in vanilla and loved it. The benefit of tanking in dungeons, pvp master in 1v1. And getting into raids and dungeons there's not much competition for gear. 
---
Mages are amazing as well. Great dps, amazing in pvp. And loved in groups. But my drawback is that there will be tons of mages walking around. So competition for spots and gear will be high.
---
Basically I want to play mage. But I don't have time to be competitive. So I may have to settle for druid. Which I'm also ok with.
---
He draws people to a dying casual game. People can be happy.
---
Removed as a repost.
---
Because the quest is epic and fun.  Why do you play the game if you don't want to have fun?
---
That's a really neat view of the class skills. Thank you for sharing that!
---
RRREEEEEEEEEEE
---
Stop this nonsense.
---
A druid can both tank and heal 5 mans, you'll have an easier time forming groups.
---
Ya im sure they'll get whatever they want, but regardless they will never be top dps lol.
---
All the insight
---
Thanks for the reply! I have heard the same, my challenge with my job and travel is I can play for a good chunk of time but typically at random times vs every Tuesday and Thursday at 6:00 for example. Does that logic hold up or is there something I’m not considering? I only ever got to 52 back in the day so I don’t want to miss anything.
---
hoj is shit
---
The amount of experienced players who researched everything vs the amount fresh players who have no clue will most likely be 10-90 %ratio so dont fear.
---
**Trying to decide between holy priest and holy paladin.**
---
I want to main heal 5 mans and heal progression raids. I enjoy casual PVP as well, open world and battlegrounds. My favorite healing class is Shaman, but our group is rolling Alliance so I can't play that.
---
I guess my main concerns are Priest combat being boring with mostly wanding, and Paladin not being able to heal well enough that its wanted in a guild.
---
My last playthrough on a private server I went mage and loved it. I'm dead set on healing this time though.
---
24
---
Not up to max level, but I could see the point in having a lvl 60 main and a 19 twink of the same class, for example.
---
So far it hasn't been a problem on the, "other", places I have played like this.
---
Not that it would matter anyway, it won't be changed even if we wanted too.
---
I for one am fine with that, both the good and the bad things.
---
Bro, I did this in the Beta this week. It was amazing, and tortuous, and tedius, and epic. I loved every moment of running around with no mount unlocking obscure FPs just to do SFK, and BFD one time for this thing. Amazing.
---
Don't be coy.

SHUT THE FUCK UP DON'T TELL ANYONE.

I’m with you there, I mained warrior in vanilla and while I wrecked people often, I too was often wrecked. Don’t want to do that again without a pocket healer. Looks like my dilemma is paladin or mage.
---
Mental gymnastics of blizzard drones is silly
---
Another non-believer converted. This is how it goes. Makes me happy to see. I am also very sad though. Never stopped playing classic. 15 years of experience and they don't invite me to beta. This makes me a sad panda. It's good newbies getting in though. I already knew where salvation lay. It's good others are beginning to see the light.
---
Bringing Classic is like legalizing marijuana/drugs. It removes profits from the black market and that market share is going to return to Blizzard/Classic servers. It's a win for Blizzard for sure. Whether it has unforeseen detrimental impacts for retail/BFA will have to be seen but for now it's a good thing for them. It's also a good thing for players because now we get a more stable and high quality product while removing the chance for sketchy p server owners stealing money and whatnot.
---
In the context of the post it makes sense.
---
Yeah but that’s where the talent trees are supposed to fit in. If you want to play ret then you should have to spec deep into the retribution tree where the damage talents are. And you would be giving up healing and defensive capability. 
---
The option for customization and hybridization still exists but having the ability to min/max your damage and healing is the best way to go about it.
---
Yeah on a pserver I rolled a druid and took up LW. It was insanely helpful to be able to gear myself while leveling. Im thinking of doing that for Classic or going Herb and Alchemy.
---
My vanilla experience was always DM for Deadmines, As Dire Maul always had the compass affix to it, 
---
Example - LFG DM North (Or DM Tribute) for a north tribute run,
---
I have seen my fair few VC's in LFG in my time though

You're thinking about the Meeting Stones added in patch 1.3. No one used them.
---
I'm talking about the actual LFG "addon" Blizzard added in the pre-TBC patch: http://web.archive.org/web/20091107221055/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/lookingforgroup.html
---
From my experience in the stress test, blizz needs to crack down on people spamming links to their twitch stream in general chat.
---
So my 14 year WoW career spent as a NE hunter (about 110 days played from Vanilla-WotLK) has left me jovially flabbergasted as to whether it's totally random or if you can make it happen with touch/timing.
---
edit: flabbergasted is not the right word for this sentence, but I wanted it to be. "No friggin clue" is more appropriate
---
Exploring into Ashenvale on my Barrens leveling Tauren for the first time. The experience of watching the environment change and then getting ganked by pvp elves just reinforced the verisimilitude of the world.
---
Are you responding to the correct post? Pretty much all of what you said is what he/she said as well. Get your pre-raid BiS and watch videos to know the fights. Knowledge and a good attitude will get you invited. 
---
With 40 people in a raid, you want good attitudes. I would personally take the boomkin that's kind and drama-free over the diva warrior/rogue just because they do double the dps. We're still going to down the bosses, (albeit more slowly), but it would be an enjoyable experience.
---
Thats a fair take. How do you define underperforming? As in not bringing full consumes/not showing up on time, or do you mean underperforming in the sense of having low damage?
---
Would you bring along an elemental shaman who always shows up on time, knows fight mechanics and comes prepared with full pots/consumes even though his damage is lower?
---
Yea I completely agree with this. The game feels so much bigger when you are stopping to enjoy just playing. As opposed to trying to rush through kalimdor and eastern kingdoms, you get to experience all of the zones and their content.
---
is the\* shit
---
OP means that the world is designed *holistically,* cohesively, and complete from beginning to end. 
---
This is essentially a new experience for WoW (other than the original Vanilla) because no other version of WoW was designed from the ground up with all its mechanics, geography and components in mind. 
---
The MMO/expansion paradigm is flawed at its core because it leaves large swaths of irrelevant, deprecated content that hang off the current experience like a rotting tumor.
---
Nerfs to racials so that people would feel more free to play what they actually want. Barber Shops.
---
Yep and Deadmines was level 10.
---
&gt;Are you responding to the correct post?
---
Nope. My fault.
---
Empty slots are viable. Thus all specs are viable in some comps anyway
---
But if you're in a guild that's letting you be a hybrid or shit spec, that means they have zero standards
---
And you're gonna have a bad time
---
Anyone who is telling you they're gonna let you in their raid as a shit spec should be avoided.
---
You really didn't bother to read his post then.
---
No it would be garbage. You can't buff Prot with out buffing Holy. Which is already way too strong. I would much rather have them intro a new class. Called the Crusader. Which would be like a paladin but, with a scowl. 
---
I do get the frustration people have with wanting a damn paladin to be able to mix it up. The fact they are healers is such a waste but, it is what they are. It's a damn shame the game has no holy warrior destined to take skulls but, it is what it is.
---
For me, community&gt;content. The social aspect is the primary reason for me. PvP has a lot to do with it as well, since your experience is different every time. Raiding is also like that for me to a lesser extent. Having other classes so you can enjoy the same content but from different perspectives is refreshing. 
---
After quitting during Cata, I've tried to come back to retail several times over the years but quit after I felt burned out after playing for a few hours. But at the same time, I was getting hooked on Vanilla and WoTLK private servers so much that I wasn't playing anything else. To this day I haven't felt burnt out with these versions of the game at all, and I'm eagerly looking forward to Classic. 
---
I was always reluctant to put too much effort into private servers, out of fear that I'd lose it all if they shut down. Not only is that not a concern anymore, but there's also the possibility of TBC and WoTLK servers with a character transfer feature. This isn't a guarantee so I'm going to enjoy Classic like it's the only one they'll do. But if they do that I'll finally get to play TBC which I never fully experienced as I started playing a month before Wrath came out, and Wrath again but with much more time to spend on it than I did in retail Wrath. All while using my characters I progressed through Vanilla and TBC with, and with a semi hardcore playstyle which I wasn't able to do back in the day.
---
Paladins are amazing heals.  Very defensive but so good.  If you plan to do anything other than heals, don't play a Paladin.  That goes for PvP and PvE.  Yes there are Ret paladins in PvP, but they are wasted potential, no matter how they argue their point.
---
I wouldn't roll a druid expecting to tank anything outside of 5 mans.  Druids also have a very rewarding pvp playstyle with high mobility and a mix between dmg and heals.  Druids are also underplayed. GL with your decision.  I'll say I played a Paladin in vanilla and it's kind of boring.
---
10/10 would chill with a dwarf
---
cant wait to get my pre raid bis hoj as hunter :)
---
I have a bunch of random toons with private. 😂
---
Edit spelling, and this:
---
My paladin is a knight lieutenant/blood guard when she’s horde only title I used when I played.
---
It was a bug in Vanilla, its not in Classic.
---
In Vanilla, this was a symptom of the same issue that caused spell batching.
---
Blizzard have gone out of their way to simulate this issue because it doesn't exist in the current engine.
---
I'd be very surprised if this is "fixed".
---
Having a mana bar sucks when tanking. The group is screwed if you go oom mid combat. Go druid, Horde doesn't even get paladins! Lok'tar ogar!
---
I played from the second week after launch and raided all endgame vanilla contend. Shout out to Zuluhed EU. 
---
So yeah there were many weird builds around, we fire mages pulled all through mc and bwl without respeccing to frost, our warlocks ware not optimal and our hunters struggled. Yes, there were guilds that raided much much then we did, we did only 2-3 evenings a week. And yes, these hardcore players might have kicked a moonkin from their raid or whatever, but from my experience the tone was very different there as well, more serious, less friendly.
---
 And I did have fun being a semi hardcore player. It seems a lot of people here talk about rushing to 60 in the most optimized way and plan raiding with their bis gear list and their cookie cutter builds. Let them.
---
To me, the best moments were post raid talks with people until 2 o'clock in the morning. Our warlock once had to rush to a cow at his farm having a baby and couldn't raid that night. That was funnny! Or silly world pvp, helping others and, most importantly: expressing myself in this game were my goals.
---
My guild had no specific builds you had to follow, except for the MT and I am looking for a similar experience when classic drops. I will play feral druid with a hybrid build and will not farm that dps item from gnomeregan. 
---
In the end I want to have fun. Just like the hardcore players want. And the first guy who tells me that build is silly or that I 'waste time', because I don't quest in an optimzed way, will be the first on my ignore list, because I just don't want to justify myself for doing my thing.
---
I believe there are many players like that out there.
---
Is it sad I can go over each and every icon and name the spell/item references without hesitation?
---
Wsg invite
---
Haha, holy shit. These are the streamers everyone is talking about? That anger. Pretty funny.
---
No man, the formula for armor physical damage reduction is known and it is  only affected by armor amount and attacker level. Both players in the video have the same amount of armor, and as i said in my post i only counted white hits with no buffs/debuffs in effect. They are supposed to take the same amount of damage and they do, hence there is no discrepancy here.
---
Yes im on EU. and I agree, would be cool :)
---
Staying loyal. 
---
I've always been a hunter, it's in my blood.
---
I remembered the name of mine!
---
Waidurdril of Terenas. An aging troll warrior with a mane of white and wearing the Pauldrons of Might I coveted so much. (It was the first transmog I farmed for, from heroic Black Morass. I never did get the vanilla version.) He spoke with a calm European accent over Vent. Somehow seemed fitting despite trolls having the Jamaican accent.
---
It was my first UBRS run ever and I was the offtank. This was the first time ever speccing prot since I was in tryhard mode now and wanted to give it my best. It was a very smooth run and so I can't remember what I was doing to attract his notice, but after we cleared Rend and my shoulders woefully did not drop, he asked if I was interested in doing 40 mans. I was guildless at the time.
---
I was overjoyed, but explained to him that my potato computer could only handle 10 mans at the most. Ye Olde Dell can only handle so much. 
---
He said, "Oh, well, if you do end up getting a better PC, you should definitely think about tanking for 40-mans." 
---
And that was it. Never heard from him again after the raid was over. No super glorious master to apprentice moment. Just a small bit of inspiration that manifested itself into something greater.
---
Feel you... before i edited my thread post i didn't even realise that the colour scheme on the epic unarmored mounts doesnt even exist on armored or the slow rare versions, atleast for night elf mounts. That makes it even more gutwrenching.
---
In a sense everyone has their own goals and if one of them are removed one may feel a little less joy leveling, but atleast we don't feel any stress anymore right...
---
The thing about vanilla that is better imo is that a relatively fresh, non raid geared level 60 will have somewhere around half of the damage of a raid geared one (at least before aq and naxx and all of that). 
---
It's not like some iterations of retail where you get 5 to 10 times as much damage as you go from fresh dinged max level to geared. So you get a strong sense for what your damage capability is and when you see even modest upgrades in that it's satisfying as opposed to being in a state where you do twice as much damage as you used to but still less than half of the damage of someone a tier or two ahead of you.
---
Thanks man :)
---
800x600 4:3 fat CRT monitor, what are you a casual?
---
&gt; even though its the same world we have been playing since 2004
---
We stopped playing in that world in 2010 when Cataclysm was released. So technically that world has been gone for longer than it existed.
---
This sounds like many crushing blows and wipes on trash, aggro radius will be a nightmare at 10.
---
Seems good for your race choice
---
I really liked this explanation in a thread about how hard BWL is going to be:
---
&gt; “...it's funny when people keep saying that you can join a casual guild that will bring players with unviable specs. Yes, you technically can, and you might even get carried through most/all of MC and Onyxia. But once you get stuck on a boss like Vael for a few weeks the "try-hard" clique of the guild will start pointing out the DPS below the tanks. Which inevitably leads to losing those tryhards or to losing those players with unviable specs (either respecing or not inviting them). Casual guilds will already have a harder time clearing content, why would they purposely make it even harder by bringing dead weight specs.”
---
&gt; In classic, everything from 1-60 has some kind of relevancy. 
---
I'd have to agree. What's nice is anyone who missed out on high level 60 content gets another shot, and none of the content will lose it's value as there isn't another expansion on the way to invalidate gear/rank. I just hope someone comes up with a fancy texture mod to make the game look a little better, but it isn't a necessity. I think I'll be happy playing and reliving it again. I'll know within the first month for sure.
---
Lmao your memory is way off. The PvE content has always been utterly trash. The only people that had it hard were the people in the race for the first kills; and yeah in this case that concerned less than 1 in 200.000 players, dual specs and any kind of option outside of the strictest min-maxing was excluded.
---
Are you actually going to give advice based on that? Are you serious? Knowing how to move out of fire and understanding the boss's rotation in vanilla is all you'll need. Clowns with min-max'd specs and gears clicking their spells and keyboard turning will never be as good as a dual spec player that actually knows how to play.
---
I'm waiting for them to increase the level cap so we can test to see if WF totem procs will reset the auto attack timer. Personally, I hope it does. I'd like to keep the skill cap as high as I can.
---
Vanilla isn't an expansion, dummy.
---
Can you still macro changing equipment in combat? 2h sword to 1h sword + shield, etc?
---
It does have an impact on everything. Get you someone who is an engineer, make you some jumper cables.
---
I think we're looking at a range of like 20-50 with some outliers tbh! I played Vanilla in 8th grade. TBC launched my freshman year of high school - 26 now. I'd imagine I'm close to the median or a little below it.... based off of nothing substantial of course.
---
We found the retail fanboy.
---
There's just enough time to figure out wtf I want to main....
---
Hopefully...
---
It’s more fun to just wing it than to plan it all out.
---
Let's say you're working on Vael, and the raid keeps dying to the flame buffet, your class leader asks you to stop dpsing for this fight and help out with heals instead, since obviously the healers you have are struggling to keep up. What do you do?
---
just been ignoring all the people complaining that regen rate must be broken because theres no down time?
---
There were realm transfers back then to help with imbalance.
---
Same. I wanna say it's a got a random trigger mechanic which has logarithmic decrease for the next successful jump in a row.
---
I remember helping my best friend who played a Paladin getting this. Traveling to Shadowfang, not exactly knowing where it is and what awaits us, travelling through Arathi and hillsbrad, First time seeing horde Players and engaging in world pvp, and witnessing first Hand the Battle between Tarrens Mill &amp; Southshore. 
---
I Think that was the Point where i Fell in Love into a Game i liked.
---
I think a lot of people here are talking about their private server experience and not their true Vanilla experience.
---
If you're leveling with a hunter, I wouldn't play rogue.  The mobs will be dead by the time you contribute anything towards them.  You'll pretty much be a hindrance.
---
Out of the three warlock has the best combined leveling potential with a hunter.  Dual pets, ranged damage, life tap for mana longevity.  Really you need to decide whether you are selecting your class for end game or the leveling process, or both.
---
He just got lucky, I've seen steamers get hit with it
---
The concept is the same though. Also OP obviously doesn't need beta if his biggest concern is missing out on a beta meta that gives no useful information to the dev's on the state of the game.
---
15, Started playing the game with my dad. Soon my whole family was playing it. Both my parents, my 2 brothers, Grandparents, Cousins and even a few of my aunts and uncles. We had a whole family guild and enough people to run UBRS with just family. Was pretty awesome.
---
Healer will be much different than in retail. You really have to manage your mana better, most good healers follow a 5 second rule (for a tick of mana regen) and never ever ever over heal. You are only given a set amount of people to heal and a few extra if a healer goes down or goes oom for a moment. After that its just cleansing and buffing people and not standing in fire.
---
I also play dota. Apparently mage is the best for playmakers. Then warrior and druid.
---
500 days played over 5 years = 100 days played/year
---
Because these same people are criticizing the hell out of others because they don't want to play the exact same way.
---
Hunters are charming pets above their level. At most they could charm new pets at level, certainly not above.
---
Dwarves are the mortal enemy of the Tauren though... they dig and dig and fuck nature up. Azeroth's global warming problem is 99% the Dwarves fault. Trolls don't like them either.
---
I had Broken Tooth on my hunter (remember waking up at 4am before school to get him), for that amazing 1.0 attack speed. He was awesome! I called him Harmless and sent him running after every caster I could ;) Such a shame they changed the unique-ness of these pets.
---
I would strangle close personal friends for the option to roll a dark iron dwarf on Horde. I suppose allies can get something as well, but I don’t really care about those blue bastards.
---
I can see why you'd think that, but really if you think about it you're still a melee class on a warrior. You have to keep running in to hit them which takes significantly longer. Let's just say 10 extra seconds.. on a quest where you have to kill 10 mobs, thats 100 extra seconds on top of the normal time it takes to kill the 10 mobs. Now apply over and over from 1-60 and you have significantly more time invested in the Warrior.
---
Mage can kill from afar and root from a distance on top of blink to build on that. Mage &gt; Warrior in terms of ease in leveling.
---
The kiting advantage would go to Mage or Hunter who can continue to slow/root and damage from afar. And to add to that, both Mage and Hunter have abilities that speed up travel (blink and Aspect of the Cheetah) where as warrior's only speed increase requires combat for Charge (minus charging Critters I suppose). So, speed to turn in quests into level 40 would go to either of those as well.
---
I vividly remember doing Duskwood and then STV. I feel like I spent weeks in STV alone.
---
Thanks for a serious answer. Yeah I was figuring they would eventually add content like OSRS ended up doing, but hope I can find that much fun with it even if they don't. Would hate to break up the population but TBC would be fun, I relate to that. I joined during wrath but didn't even make end game til cata because I was a silly lil kid who had no idea what I was doing.
---
So low levels don’t think higher levels are asking for Deadmines when in fact their referring to Dire Maul. 
---
It’s literally the only time this was used back then.
---
Paladins are really, really good single-target healers, make no mistake. In fact, many would say they're the best main tank healers. Don't worry about them being not good enough. Although, I wouldn't say they're much more "fun to level" than priests; you'll have a lot of downtime waiting for judgment to come off CD, just auto-attacking. 
---
Priests might get a bit more flexibility in healing though, and don't have to worry about blessings like paladins do. Priests have many more abilities to heal with, while (as far as I know, never played high level pally healer) paladins probably only have a few flash of light ranks, holy light as an emergency heal, bubbles, or lay on hands, whereas priests have too many heals to name.
---
Either are strong in PvP, just in different situations. If I were you, though, I'd roll paladin, because I'd like having the option of playing ret casually (although shadow priests are also a lot of fun to offspec).
---
I agree that enhance is not a good spec.  WF is just hoping for a proc against people with shit gear, worthless in PvE (mostly), etc.
---
But i don't think it's nearly as bad as boomkin as a spec.  
---
Aside from that I can't find reference to SS not proccing WF.  I remember it doing that.  If you mean it can't proc WF if your basic attack procced WF then yeah, the 3s ICD stops it.
---
I've looked through the patches and found zero reference to SS not proccing WF.
---
If curse/twitch does everything right then it should work like it does in retail. I don't know enough about it but my addons are on curse.
---
I want to play warlock but the low mobility aspect seems like it might be boring
---
I will never understand playing holy paladin without a gun on your head. Literally spamming one key all night long, zero strategy, zero intellectual input. Was my first class rolled back in 2005 and never could play it that way.
---
A party of five will most likely cripple you in quests that require item drops from mobs
---
People that take a week off work are so amusing to me.
---
Me. I did not like the idea because I have done it all before.  Then I realized I can multibox, and run the auction house.  The economic destruction I am going to bring by cornering the market on quest items.  Oh LAWDY.  Then when I am on the ground, 5 boxing SL locks, GG fellow PvP Questers.
---
Excellent, I'd forgotten how many of the awesome old wallpapers they'd removed.
---
I never felt that anything was more alt unfriendly than expansions like Legion.  You had required upkeep to do on your main in order to keep current on your AP, that an alt was already behind.
---
In Classic, if people wanted to push your alt up through, they could.  You could catch up, potentially.  But in Legion, your alts were always behind.
---
And if you took a week off of your main, your main was also always behind.
---
They re-release servers after a year or so with a new fresh server, so I continually start from scratch every year or 2. It's fun, idk. It's like a new Diablo or Path of Exile season.
---
Let's see about that.
---
I wouldn't even group up for 1-5 I'd just try to do quests and if they are too congested I'd go ahead and grind.
---
I don't see any way they possibly overwrite Vanilla when bringing it back was the whole point of Classic. If they go that route they'll definitely be separate servers
---
http://classicdb.ch/

That's the website to use
---
Hes an orc
---
Hmm sounds legit. Though I remember always feeling like I would definetly get a second one if I touched down lightly after the first... oh well. Brains are great and finding patterns that don't exist. I always felt like I knew when I was going to flip, and confirmation biased a notion of control deep into my head
---
No changes
---
everything in duskwood, that zone is pure spooky goodness and i love it, also archeus is cool.
---
Is re-living really what matters, though? Sounds like the "it's just nostalgia" argument
---
Game should come with 4:3 aspect turned on auto
---
Would you gladly sell your sister for these post to stop?
---
Alright cool, thank you very much! I might play there then. Would be kinda cool to make friends that I might possibly be able to meet IRL as well
---
It depends on the level of content.  If we're gearing up for a guild run of BWL, a lot of the above will not be forgiven so easily.
---
It also depends on their attitude.
---
Yeah but I think a lot of people in this sub would sub to reserve a name because we are the most excited/interested people in classic wow in general. I feel like a lot of the players on release will see oh wow classic is out tomorrow that's cool without even knowing about name reserve. I just don't think its indicative of the overall classic population.
---
Joined bg..
---
I was 14.  Looking back I'm glad my guild tolerated me as I think everyone else was 18+. Luckily I'd already gone through puberty so my voice didn't stick out like a sore thumb, only my antics did.
---
Would it be less egregious without the sound? Doesn't that only happen when they literally do it in the microphone and their noise gate doesn't stop it from getting picked up?
---
Paladin is definitely good enough to be wanted in a guild. Their buffs and healing efficiency are second to none.
---
What about people who take the afternoon off of work?
---
Maybe my memory is shit, but I don't recall any of those in the dwarf starting zone.  Just the tool chest one that will be impossible to complete anyway.
---
mmm
---
people are going to be killing Ragnaros in greens 12 days after launch tho. most guilds are gonna have plenty of room to be flexible.
---
I'm pretty sure people are just going out of the way not to read properly the OP. I do think that so many people are watching streamers that they will comment when things look wrong . 
---
But listening to alot of podcasts like good morning azeroth , deftalk or countdown to classic I hear some talk of people who are interested in testing very very specific mechanics and trying for specific exploits with the layering that streamers are definitely not trying to test.
---
[Shh.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/152/332/33d.jpg)
---
Hey man i have a similar experience, 8/9 t3 on my mage only missing the robes (French guild Overall on Archimonde EU). All is good but during BC i stop playing during BT progress and one of my friends asked me to lend him my account so he could farm.
---
He was a healer so I was like "Ok man np". Well turns out that after 2 months he was leveling enchanting and during BC the top tier vanilla comps (crystals from disenchanting epic gear) were still expensive so he disenchanted some of my old gear...
---
Well this is how i lost 4 t3 pieces... He saved the t3 ring at least, still got it in my bank :)
---
I don't feel like working right now.  Important to note matchups change a lot in different gear balances.  I mostly played mage 1.7 to 1.11, playing priest before and after.   I mostly learned mage as pom-frost, because of [this video made me roll a mage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWp8YLzLsnU).  I played deep frost and elemetnal, but mostly in group pvp and not as much duelling, so most of the matchups are from the assumption that I am pom-frost.  
---
Mage v Warrior 100% mage favor, mana shield charge, only blink intercepts if he faps you can just poly or counter fap, best warriors will try and intim same global as your blink, mage trinket removes fear so gg just R1 frostbolt spam him 100-0 to bm him
---
Mage v Hunter 90% mage favor.  He gets intitial hits on you, but then you blink in shatter combo in his face and hide in his dead zone.  Maximize fireblast, scorch, coc, and arcane explosion.  You CANNOT let him get distance so you have to counter scatter trap with iceblock.  10% in his favor because of that multishot reset trinket, if he crit streaks you on open he can pop you.  This gets better for mage as both players gear.  BM hunters are annoying, if serious fight coldsnap and double block his BW then easy mode, but most of the time 1 block is good enough and tank pet for a few sec, after BW poly pet CS hunter(so he cant dispel) and go to town on low dps hunter.  
---
Mage v elemental shaman 80% mage favor play it like i listed shadow above, stay &gt;20 yards at all time to prevent shocks,  This fight gets better for elemental over time.  Eventually elemental does so much damage they can almost 1shot people so its scary to let him cast lightning bolts in your face.  If you CS too early and he doesnt die, and youve closed distance for shatter that is a death, so you have to tank 1-2 casts before locking his nature tree.  If you realize you've fucked up the CS you can just hard poly reset to save the fight.
---
Mage v enhance 100% mage favor  He literally has no way to close the distance once you've polied him and used slows.  Assuming he doesnt start the fight on your character model, he should never physically hit you.  
---
Mage v Ret 95 % mage favor  Similar to enhance but freedom.  If a ret full tryhards with consumes they can be very annoying, and if they don't they are a joke.  I've been surprised by a ret a few times where I wasn't expecting the full engr rotation of reflector, bomb, fap, net, etc and got got.  Important thing is early R1 frostbolt to trigger freedom, poly off of that.  Unload at max range, only CS heals under 60% if he fap/pots/anything at range poly.  Only blink hoj, block if he nets or rocket helm or anything funky like that.  Chicken to prevent polyies in freedom is scary, probably worth blocking.  I usually played pom-frost instead of barrier, and id pom poly him after leaving block here since he would be in melee and id be saving blink for hoj.  
---
Mage v Warlock 80% if non SL, 30% if SL, double chance if you are elemental
---
Mage v Rogue, non-prep 100% mage favor.  This plays a lot like warrior, mana shield tank the cheapshot, only blink kidney.  Only difference is the vanish, just R1 blizzard if he does it, after your poly use fireballs mixed with R1 frostbolts to keep a dot on him
---
Mage v Rogue, w/prep 40% mage favor This starts in rogue favor when mage has no HP, then when mage can tank a bit mage gets ahead, then late when everyone has all engr and rogue has amazing damage rogue starts wining this almost consistently.  The problem from the mages perspective is that the mage and counter the rogue over and over, and they can trade CDs but the rogue will constantly chip damage at the mage and with great gear that chip damage can often just kill the mage.  If the mage ever gets a reset though, the mage wins.  Like with SL locks, if you are elemental as mage double win chance.  When rogues start cheesing by wearing naxx frost resist gear, it makes me sad
---
Mage v Feral, 40% mage favor* 99% of feral druids are bad so youll beat all of those  Idea is to slow him so much with cheap shit that you OOM him, bad feral play too aggressively, get behind in HP and get fucked trying to regrowth at too low level, good ones are very slippery and understand how to keep their HP up early and use travel more then cat.  On my server there were 3 "good" feral druids I beat 2 of then 100% of the time, and 1 of them about 60% of the time.  
---
Mage v disc priest 80% mage favor  Disc just cant do enough damage to scare you, damage damage into poly reset over and over.  Eventually you crit streak or he OOMs.  
---
Mage v shadow 90% mage favor  Detailed above
---
Mage v disc/shadow hybrid 10% if priest is good. When I quit mage this is what I pvpd as so some bias here.  Priest has regen and healing gear to typically can outheal your damage at range, picks up blackout damage damage, shadow range and silence so if you ever close distance at all priest can start forcing blocks off silences 45 sec CD.  Unlike shadow, the disc hybrid will survive long enough to force multiple blocks from the mage and eventually overwhelm him.  Manaburn from priest is very effective here.  If priest is troll, shadowguard can proc blackouts every time mages casts, so priest can use to close distance.  Mage tips would be to reset more frequently, only continue a fight if you get early crits that puts priest behind, and also be mindful of facing so if priest blackouts you, you can blink away and not toward them.  
---
Mage v resto shaman 100%  rshaman is same as elemental, but he just doesn't do enough damage to kill you, rshaman only gained 1 NS
---
Mage v Hpaladin 100%  Other class I played, mage should win 100% of the time, with freedom hpaladin can stalemate if there is any terrain to los on
---
Mage v rdruid I honestly don't know if I fought a good one back in the day, I never lost this but I think I should have lost this matchup.  I think a rdruid that spams travel and just dots me should never really be killable, but every rdruid that i played seemingly did something I thought was dumb, and put themselves behind casting in my face, got CS and died.
---
Your mages will love you
---
Excuse me but are you saying a low level mob hits equally as hard regardless of your player level?  no thanks.
---
Seven words and for some reason I'm thinking that the WoCW would be better of without such an entitled wannabe who you appear to be...
---
You dont use your vacation time to do things you enjoy?
---
Depends on that content, if we are pushing world 1st(2nd) or progression (reprogression?) then obviously having everyone playing the most optimal builds will be best. But if its content thats on farm or just easy, any spec is fine as long as you bring in the numbers. But if your gear sucks, your rotation and damage suck, and you just suck then no sir/ma'am, you need to go play maple story or something.
---
Lul
---
"Splat"
---
Not nearly as amusing, that seems rather tame and fine.
---
You should see Diablo 3 rn, they’re abbreviating damage to display stuff like 639B and 13T for billion and trillion lmao.
---
Paladin healer seems the best fit for me. You're tanky, amazing cooldowns, good heals. A healer in general complements a warlock the most due to infinite mana if the lock knows how to keep weaving life tap. Also on top of your divine shield you will also have soulstone and healthstone - which is crazy because you can also ress people after wipes(unlike druids) or use SS if u die in pvp for some double pleasure immortadin. Paladins have very good mana management so you can play the attrition game which hunters and especially locks excel at.
---
So lock dots everything for an inevitable death while hunter can be the annoying target that can oom others, kite, cc (aoe frost trap is great in wpvp and bgs especially if u specc Entrapment) and finish off people while all this is doubled in effectiveness due to your blessing of freedom and spammable dispell (edit: and blessing of wisdom is so good for hunters!)
---
A paladin healer might seem simple but it can be played with great complexity as well. If u know how to manage mana, keep playing with blessings while fighting, changing auras while fighting, use seals (seal of justice that has a chance to proc a 2s stun is crazy good with a fast 1H to spam autoattacks while in healing downtime in PvP) you can keep yourself on the toes for the whole fight.
---
Versus shamans, although they are a straight counter to you, you can still do shenanigans by spamming rank1 righteous fury on you so you make their purge 50% less effective by only dispelling 1 beneficial spell and then play the mana game.  Versus polymorph, fear and incap spells you can blessing of Sacrifice on an ally (lock can lifetap for on demand damage) and break them. And of course, don't forget to always have hunter and lock pet blessed :)
---
Edit: I didn't even mention the tanking / melee aspect that you can offer (super viable while healing spec'd) which complements your group. Also in late game when u get spell damage with plate you can literary nuke people to death. OH AND HAMMER OF WRATH &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
---
Studies show that people who don’t use all of their paid vacation are actually worse employees so maybe they’re doing the right thing.
---
I was a human warlock... so guess that means I am being revived as an undead warlock??? Screw that. For The alliance!!
---
Yes, combined with how many numbers you get at a time  it's all just a wash. My frostmage in BFA gets a flurry proc and all of a sudden I have 6 different 10k+ crits all happening within 2 seconds of each other. It's just silliness. Getting a shatter combo for 1.5k that does half their life is infinitely more satisfying than 6 20k crits that did 20 percent of the enemies health.

Tinder is shit now.  You have to pay.
---
Sounds vaguely like words that could be together!  Looking forward to remaking some memories.
---
I think that’s the case with a lot of games that gets expansions
---
It’s hard to make an expansion to a game and keep old stuff relevant as well. And for each expansion, they have to bring something new and exciting, which brings your further away from the original game.
---
Imo they went too far with expansions in WoW. Around 2 expansions are usually fine for a game, but after that it starts to be to much, and it’s time to make a sequel to the game, rather than just pump out more expansions, just like they do with their other games. You don’t play Warcraft 1 expansion 7, Diablo 1 expansion 8 or Starcraft expansion whatever, they reset it, and learn from it
---
At least that’s how I see it
---
You think that over half of whatever guild I'm in on Beta are streamers?
---
Swap in to my healing gear and heal, as any good hybrid should. Same goes for fights that require removal of poisons etc. Though I fear most guilds won't see the merit in that, as there's a lot of dogma surrounding hybrids. Shadow Priests and Ferals have somewhat managed to break through the negativity and find a place, even as one of's. I've kinda got my heart set on elemental however, and I understand that they don't really bring any unique buffs that a resto shaman can't already do and they're considered the bottom of the barrel.
---
I'm not sure that you would. It might not reference that specifically. It might say something else. Like you can't proc wind fury off of abilities. My source is just a guy who has been playing Shamans a long time. That's why I said to investigate. I can't imagine him being wrong but, maybe he is. Honestly hopefully he is.
---
If you carry your own Weight i dont mind what spec you are using. But to avoid autistic screeching within the guild i cant give bis loot to off meta specs. Im personally pretty cool with guildies trying New things but many arent
---
That pic is forgetting pristine black diamond and azerothian diamond
---
Not in guilds with people with hybrid specs, lol
---
Yea it's easy, but when you drop all standards and have 30+ guys who have no idea what's going on. It's not that easy. And no one competent is gonna stick around to give the guy who doesn't spec or buff right loot prio over himself.
---
You make it easy by instituting standards.
---
There are still guilds on P servers struggling with Naxx, and they have some standards.
---
As soon as you give some one in a crap spec loot, you've just told your whole guild they can all be that crappy and get loot. And ruined your guild's ability to progress
---
Yea sure in theory you could be good enough players to get away with that. But again good palyers aren't going to give idiots in the wrong spec loot prio and just stay in that guild. lol, almost impossible unless you're all a buncha IRL friends or coworkers or something.
---
Hmmm what if I were to leave early and call out sick the following day...
---
You mean goblins right.  Have you ever seen a dwarven logging camp? Plooms of smoke over IF?  Frankly wood makes them itch.  Who needs coal and wood when you have magma. Literally the most eco friendly race.
---
Ignore the dark iron bastards though.
---
I've played a mage for a long time. While you're definitely right that mages are a dime a dozen, typically I don't have a hard time finding a group. There is some competition with gear, seeing as warlocks often want similar items that mages want, but it's not enough to sweat about.
---
If you want to play a mage, there are plenty of ways for you to get good gear in solo content/dungeons/pvp. Mages are fantastic AoE grinders, and you can make a lot of money just by farming DM hyenas (this is assuming that the pathfinding mechanics work similarly in Blizz Classic). There are a ton of great BoE items for mages, especially if you get tailoring. A fully enchanted bloodvine mage, or someone with Robe of the Void and darkmoon trinkets, is not easily trifled with. 
---
It sounds like you want to roll a mage, so you should do it!

High quality version of the one above:

Why would you 2-man it? If you're tanking and you already have a priest to heal, you have the hardest classes to fill for a 5-man. Charge to run the DPS through. In addition, 2-manning would mean longer times on the bosses and a loss of GPH as you're going to have a repair bill.
---
DPS classes always consist of like 90% of all players on a server. You'll find someone that's tired of waiting and spamming trade/general to get into a group and will pay the service fee to get an "instant group" basically.
---
Not to be even more pedantic, but what you describe are 16 hours per week JUST for raiding - that's basically 4 hours short of a part time job where I'm from. 
---
Now, I'm going to enjoy this shit very much, but it certainly is a time commitment, especially considering knowing the ins and outs of your class takes some serious prepwork, too
---
&gt; a big part of hunter rotation in vanilla was fitting aimed shots in so as not to conflict with auto.
---
Only good hunters did that.
---
Priority #1: Fill Raid Slots - Hybrid allowed.
---
Priority #2: Performance -  Hybrid allowed.
---
Priority #3: Contribution - Hybrid allowed.
---
Priority #4: Sucking up to me - Hybrid allowed.
---
As long as you have your priorities straight.
---
What are we lookin at here? Just looks like you pulled some adds.
---
Please don't give them any pre-order ideas..
---
In your shoes I think I'd personally play priest.  Of course I really love that class in general so I have some bias.  But really you can do anything.  You can go deep holy for strong heals, or disc for good heals and damage plus spirit buff for the group.  Or you can go shadow to melt faces while buffing lock damage (and still off heal).  You can heal dungeons just fine as shadow too...  You have offensive and defensive dispel...priest is just all around a great setup to compliment that group regardless of spec.
---
...thank you for your service...to the Core....
---
There’s more to the game than raiding but thats not something I except BFA themepark players to grasp.
---
It's actually the opposite, for rogues at least, we ONLY want to see our MH swing timer, OH is just screen clutter.
---
I do. I use it for travel with my wife and kid, lol. To use it so you can binge a 14 year old computer game the moment it releases is pretty selfish, pathetic and disgusting behavior *in my personal opinion*. Obviously we all lead very different lives...there is nuance...extenuating circumstances and excuses yadda yadda yadda. In my mind I believe that *most* people engaging in this sort of behavior are Hutt-like creatures, and I find it equal parts sad and amusing.
---
No you can't, shadowmeld can't be used in combat in Classic.

Yeah it felt like if I got successful flip the next one had a 90% chance followed by 50% chance followed by 10%. I had the same feeling about "knowing when I was going to flip"
---
It's not just about that, there were also technical issues with the numbers being so big.
---
Bosses had to start having multiple health bars because health values had reached the maximum value an unsigned integer could represent.
---
Garrosh was a particularly notable example of this.
---
Right click auto loot (not aoe loot) vanilla had auto loot but you had to hold shift when looting. Now you no longer need to hold shift.

---
Except with healing support capabilities.
---
Yep. You might be interested in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btuacn/people_are_having_more_fun_on_a_level_30_capped/ep3fse0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) which generated a lot of great discussion.
---
With that attitude you’ll be fine as long as you’re capable and willing of doing both. If I’m the shaman class leader you’d be on my list to bring, since you understand that, and when the timing presents itself I’d have no issues swapping you back and forth as needed.
---
There’s so much drama on this subject right now. Show up, be prepared to raid, be prepared to fill any role your class is capable of (be that support/heal/decurse, damage, tank, whatever).
---
We never invited a warrior to the guild that wasn’t willing to tank when called on, even if they were mainspec dps, the same should apply to every hybrid
---
Here's how shooting works:
---
1: You have your attack speed, say a weapon with a base of 3.4 seconds and a quiver that gives you 15% attack speed, so the speed is ~2.96. You have a hidden 0.5 second cast timer on shooting, but that 0.5 seconds is included in the total 2.96 seconds if you stand still. This means that right after you shoot, you would have (2.96-0.5)=2.46 seconds where you can move freely without losing dps (this is where the most common auto shoot timer would show "white"), and after the 2.46 seconds, standing still for 0.5 seconds will launch the next projectile (once you're at a state where standing still for 0.5 seconds will fire an arrow, that is when the most common timer shows a red bar that gets shows how close you are to finishing the "cast").
---
2: When you use Aimed Shot, it takes 3 seconds (less while Rapid Fire is up, not sure about Imp. Aspect of the Hawk or your quiver). While Aimed Shot is casting, you cannot auto shoot, but the cooldown (2.96 seconds in the previous example) will still tick along. This means, for all ranged weapons in the game, that right after you shoot Aimed Shot, 0.5 seconds later you will also fire an auto shot, since no weapon with a proper quiver will give you an attack time slower than 3 seconds (3.4 is the slowest, and even non-optimal quivers with 14% increase still nets you a 2.98 attack speed). If you have 1 second left before your next auto shot and then start casting Aimed Shot, you would then be "clipping" an auto shot that you would have had if you had delayed your Aimed Shot by a second. If you start casting Aimed Shot and then cancel before that 0.5 seconds pass in this example, you will still shoot your auto shot after that 1 second (but it will be delayed if you wait say 0.8 seconds, since the hidden 0.5 second cast timer will also start then, resulting in an effective delay of 0.8-0.5=0.3 seconds)
---
3: Multi-Shot has a "ranged speed" cast speed, which is not the 2.96 seconds but rather the hidden 0.5 second cast time. Those 0.5 seconds can delay auto shot if Multi-Shot is used in the auto shot's 0.5 second cast window, but will otherwise not affect your auto shots.
---
I hope this helps
---
Take the shot!
---
Doesn't matter if that's what the doctor is comfortable prescribing. Doctors have different opinions. Eating a co-pay and ending up with a prescription that you didn't want just makes you an idiot when you don't even need one to begin with. Worse, if your insurance gets involved like mine where they require referrals. At that point, you've paid for two co-pays and still don't have an adderall prescription. Going to doctor and blatantly asking for adderall isn't going to work in your favor either. People have the misconception that doctors can/will write a prescription for anything, and that just isn't the case. Something like adderall creates extra paperwork for doctors because it is a schedule II drug.
---
It's been 13 years, so I might not be remembering correctly...
---
The level 40 mounts had no armor, right? You could just ride that bad boy around :P
---
Why are you even in this sub? You seem very hostile to classic
---
wich is equivalent to one level in stealth, no? Llike you are level 61 instead of level 60?
---
I messed up level and points. You are right tho :p
---
Yeah, maybe they are. I'm not talking specifically about the OP because I don't know them.
---
People mistake the words "parasitic" and "viable" too often :P
---
You can't judge the spec completely separate from the player, yet the absolute majority of good players will stay away from bad specs knowing that their efforts are not going to pay off.
---
I'm probably rolling a healer. It's one thing I never played while I played WoW (vanilla, TBC, WotLK). No experience in healing but I think it's something I want to try. Now, the class choice is what I'm still on the fence about.
---
So Shammy (orc or maaybe troll) or Priest (troll) are what I'm currently considering. Would like to get into endgame and raiding too. Honestly, I'm just at a loss trying to decide between these two. I guess one of the great problems is that I know nothing about healing and Shammy healing in particular (apart from chain heal). Any insight which would be better for a new healer? Which is more fun, how easy it is to get into raiding and how much I would need to fight for gear?
---
I heard if you buy 24 wow tokens you can get into beta.
---
Well it's the only way to include all the necessary meme specs.
---
Edit: Shit I could have used melee hunter and fire mage.
---
Hi, /u/SPieL_ZeuG
---
I think the way they cycle the servers, so people kind of have to level again or be on a dead server, plays a role in keeping people playing... personally, the whole idea was not up my alley, imo. But I *lived* in AB back in the day, so I don't mind the static thing, and don't want to level five different rogues.
---
there are several proofs that the damage of mobs is the same like on vanilla. Just look for it :)
---
Female Dwarves must be protected at all costs.
---
Yes.  Send me 500 bucks and he’ll get it to you.
---
 \-Meeting random people while questing.
---
I run into people at every single quest spot. 2 nights ago we had a full group at the Dwarven fort in Southern Barrens and everyone stayed until we all finished. Every time I go to a new quest spot I invite or get invited and we finish together. Most of the time people are willing wait until everyone finishes the quest.
---
\-Seeing them again in later zones.
---
Definitely. Most of the time you just notice them, it's not a thing where everyone is like "oh, it's you!" but there was one guy that tanked RFC for my group when I did it then joined the guild a day or 2 later.
---
\-Sharing of items in dungeons, etc.
---
People are always willing to offer food/water and to help get the quest items from what I've done so far. 
---
\-Profession economy. Are people selling pots, enchants, etc.?
---
Not really. There are people giving stuff away, and you can find someone to make stuff for you if you have mats for no charge. There is stuff on the AH, but I can't imagine there being a massive trade for it.
---
\-Actually talking to each other?!?
---
Every time I run a dungeon the group is chatting the whole time.
---
\-Any noticeable difference between horde and alliance populations? 
---
Seems pretty even, I haven't gone out of my way to get into any of the big PvP things that pop off, but I just hit 30 last night.
---
/r/gatekeeping and I've played enough private servers thank you.
---
Yeah, that's totally what I loved about vanilla. It was self-contained and internally consistent. Not just in content but also lore.
---
I remember playing for so long during vanilla and seeing Argent Dawn everywhere, and I wanted the tabard and the rep so bad, and I wanted to finally get to experience that story. Then BC came out and when I finally got to around level 50 and went to the plaguelands I was so excited because the quests involved the Argent Dawn. But then everyone said "oh that's a waste of time now, Argent Dawn is useless" and it was an incredible letdown for me. I remember it distinctly. I still wanted to do that content, but I realized it was truly a waste of time which would not progress my character meaningfully.
---
All the Argent Dawn/Crusade lore was still there, but the RPG aspect of the gear rep etc. was nullified, so the lore was not consistent with the rewards, breaking my immersion. Immersion for me is 100% why I loved Vanilla, and it turned into "me playing a game" instead of me in the world, experiencing events *as my character*.
---
Instead of experiencing cool lore and being rewarded for it, I had to cognize that epic lore was no longer rewarding because the world and the power curve progression was no longer continuous.
---
That's why I think the expansion model for MMOs is fundamentally flawed and does not interest me personally. I play WoW for the immersion, not anything else.
---
Watch the Tauren he disappears, probably like others have said because he accepted a BG.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Question about the hybrid caster dps in endgame.  Since I keep hearing they all basically go oom too quickly to be considered a good raid spec, can they not just use downranked spells like healers or does that just do no damage?  I'm talking Shadow/boomkin/ele mainly.  I always prefer playing a hybrid so would like to see if the dps parts of the hybrids could at least be passable in raids.
---
2nd question about the debuff limit:
---
With only 16 debuffs I assume that means certain classes will not be allowed to use their debuffs correct?  So a feral wouldn't be able to rake/rip, locks can only use CoE, and what about rogues?   
---
Just trying to narrow down my class choices, I only hit level 30 in vanilla, didnt start till the october right before BC hit.
---
link?
---
Specializing shouldn't mean forgoing two thirds of what makes your class. A Retribution Paladin is still more durable than other dps and can still heal. I'd rather they make those aspects more meaningful than just boost the spec's dps to that of a pure dps class. That's like I liked the WotLK talents like The Art of War and Divine Storm. The first gave Ret instant Flashes of Light. The second gave passive healing while you dealt damage. Such a Ret Paladin is still predominantly a dps but he isn't *just* a dps.
---
lol it's the same thing, just back at the start
---
#uncomfortabletruth
---
Silithus.
---
Correct, no armor. The post is edited with every night elf mount. They're a tad slow though so that won't do.
---
Honestly, if your server is heavy populated, you can be Herb/Engineer and actualy make money of it by selling the herbs and buying the bars.
---
Herbs are way more in demand than ores/bars are in vanilla.
---
Firstly you have to have the subscription.
---
We have to wait until all the boob streamers have tested the game
---
People are literally always pugging MC and ZG on private servers. BWL and AQ20 also get pugged, but to a lesser extent. I know that private servers won't be an exact comparison, but even if pugs are less common in Classic, there will still be plenty of them.
---
But good luck convincing a hunter to spam wing clip the entire raid. Might as well get a warrior to use it (but they don't want to either).
---
Warrior or Warlock. I mained Paladin in vanilla, but my friends are going Horde this time around, so I want to complement them. No one is rolling a tank, so I think warrior would be best (I love the fantasy of wearing plate). However, I know that I am way more hyped and invested in Classic than any of my friends. I really worry about getting bogged down in leveling with a warrior despite employing the hamstring method.
---
"Im out of range!"
---
Post 1.12 new content is something I'm interested in, but reluctant about since it's current Blizzard that would be developing it. If the option is between something that could either hit or miss, and TBC which is definitely a hit, the answer should be quite obvious. Especially for Blizzard since it would cost much less to implement TBC servers and have a much greater chance of success. 
---
Dividing up the population with TBC servers is a concern. Even if they didn't do character transfers, having it would still have the same sort of effect as most players would play their Classic characters much less often as they're focusing on the "new" expansion. But the way I see it server mergers would be an eventual thing with Classic anyway if they didn't do either post 1.12 content and TBC servers. It's something I could live with if it only happens at the beginning of TBC/Wrath servers, and it wouldn't be so bad as seeing a ton of players you've never seen before would lend to that new expansion feel.
---
I mean you replied to this post within 15 mins of it going up, so I’m guessing you’re pretty hyped too. No need to be judgemental about what someone else wants to spend their vacation doing
---
Nothing personal, kid.
---
When I first played, I was a clicking resto shaman without any macros or keybinds. I was able to heal dungeons just fine. I don't think low level dungeons were ever really THAT hard. They were just big and awesome (and there was less AOE spam). :D
---
thanks, thought they wanted to remove wsg after the weekend
---
Damn, I lost count at 50 something
---
I’ve never seen a streamer who muted or cared. They all do like this, loud ass rips into the mic. Suppose it’s too much work to mute when you have to vape every 30 seconds. 
---
But yes If there is a vaping streamer who properly muted while vaping it would be fine. I just have never seen one.
---
Blizzard said they're done sending Beta invites out.
---
They can enjoy whatever they want. I'm allowed to think they're stupid and/or wrong if I wish and even to express as much. Doing so is what I enjoy, so you should stop shushing me reeeee
---
Casual player here looking to get into vanilla for the first time and haven't played WOW at all since WOTLK.  I've pretty much narrowed my class down to mage (though somewhat considering hunter or rogue or even a healer just to have the best odds at seeing raids) as it seems friendly to my casual play schedule (\~2hours per night a few days a week, max) despite there likely being a million other mages.
---
My question is what professions should I take?  With a lighter play schedule than many (most?), I suspect I'll be behind the curve and have a hard time getting really rare recipes or getting my skill up as fast as others to take advantage of markets for wands/bags/gear/chants/etc.  Should I focus on just doing two gathering skills/fishing or do you think there'd still be value in going the traditional herb/alch or tailoring/chating routes that is typically recommended for mages?
---
There is no criteria. You just need to be subbed. And beys invites are going to be rare here on out until they need more. They currently have said they have enough.
---
Druids are jack of all trades, master of... flag carrying.
---
Shamans are the masters of support.
---
Druids will be quicker to level.
---
Shaman are probably a more fun healing class.
---
I guess my personal annoyances with each class is, shaman have to constantly have to be thinking about what totems to use, and orient their movement around where there totems are. Druid shapeshifting costs a lot of mana, and their actionbar management for all of those different forms is always tough for me.
---
Either class will be fun, and get into a group easily.
---
They have “rapidly decreased” sending out invites, and that happened a week ago and I haven’t heard of any people (excluding streamers or friends/family of streamers) getting a key since then.
---
I think they only said “rapidly decreased” instead of outright stopped because it gives them wiggle room to invite streamers that want to try it out without getting shit for saying they stopped invites.
---
Tl;dr - das it mane invites are done for now.
---
We did DM from 13-20, then did stockades since it was fast Af til 25 and then went to SN until around 40. Finished in ZF from 40-50ish. 
---
Tried a few different instances from 20-30 but none were that dense or as fast. Plus you had to consider resets. We just master-looted gear to whoever needed it.
---
I've had friends not loot a boss after I verbally said the boss drops his head or something along those lines.
---
There needs to be an addon that detects the mob and just puts giant text on your screen or something.
---
I know, it was mostly joking if you really preferred the look of unarmored. Just get the Carrot and the blacksmith item to get as close as possible ;)
---
Hi, /u/UrbanBob
---
Yeah IDK how to feel about it. I haven't gotten to try beta yet and only played a few private servers many years ago. 
---
When I played vanilla I only got to see up to twin emps in AQ 40 and nothing in naxx. Part of me wants nothing to change so I have an almost guarantee to see the end of vanilla content one day.
---
On the other hand, I don't want to see the end of vanilla too fast either. Tough choice :P
---
Awful pricks who play terribly but still demand "pure classes" for "pure roles".
---
In other words, pricks.
---
The add-on was either HealBot or Decursive. I think both also had an option to automatically cancel any spellcast that is about to overheal.
---
People didn't learn, people didn't know. The meta for healers was basically max int and mp5, holy priests were in fact disc/holy and every fight was a flash heal snipefest.
---
Downranking, spirit and +healing really became the meta once flash healers hit their brick wall with the twin emps. That's how I remember it.
---
It's because you didn't spend any time proving your theory. You can't claim Blizzard *deliberately* made dungeons easier without first proving that dungeons are, in fact, easier.
---
&gt; Horde doesn't even get paladins! 
---
*....yet*
---
I'm no expert, but I'll give you my two cents.
---
In terms of mobility, Warlock is a snail. The other classes you mentioned have abilities like sprint (Rogue), charge/intercept (Warrior), and ghost wolf (Shaman). In terms of playstyle, Warrior probably more closely fits something like a DH...but only just. Also, since they are the primo tanks, you shouldn't have a difficult time finding groups if you're comfortable with the role.
---
Haha... nooo, the real deal or no deal! No jokes all hardcore seriousness here my man &lt;3.
---
I never got into the end game much in Vanilla. I really enjoyed the leveling experience with my friend. I have a few memories of us going into enemy zones and flagging ourselves for PvP when we were lvl 20-50. The first time we did it on our alliance characters, we ran all the way to the barrens around level 25 and killed like a 17ish orc. We got chased down by a bunch of higher level players on mounts and got the crap scared out of us. First world pvp experience. Super awesome.
---
Ppl on here are downright obsessive.
---
It aint bringing back your youth. Many will find it wasnt as good as they remembered and it didnt age as well as they thought
---
Maxing blacksmithing, what were you thinking!
---
Imagine if they sold a 6 month sub that included beta AND the original (pre 1.4) mounts (Old School Ride achievement) for your retail account.
---
It would go like hotcakes.
---
Biggest responsibility as the leader in a guild is to know the boss mechanics and strategy inside and out. You'll be looked to for strategic changes when something isn't working so you'll be required to have a firm understanding of all roles. 
---
All the great guild leaders I've had in the day have either played every role in the game, or have played their niche role long enough to bare witness to the ins and outs of every class
---
&gt; Even worse was your pet abandoning you because you don't have the right food for it and it died like 15 times already :)))
---
Is...is this gonna be a thing in Classic?
---
Oh wow you're retarded :(

Some turbo-nerd having a special mount "alienates" you? And apparently, 99% of the playerbase? Really?
---
[You should read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8hg5ej/picking_your_class_a_guide_for_new_players/), it'll probably help you out.
---
If you want a casual, easy-paced leveling experience, I suggest hunter. From the list of the three classes you have experience with, mages are the easiest to level, and hold the greatest potential in solo situations. But, read the class picking guide.
---
They're viable in the same way that someone wanting to dig a hole could use a shovel or a garden spade. Both dig a hole, but you'll do it faster and cleaner with a lot less effort using the shovel.
---
make a guild discord.
---
great for regular chat, lfg, voice chat, etc. we'll be using google docs to keep track of everything in our gbank and just pinning that and all the other links to that sort of stuff (guides, misc notes, whatever) onto a channel so its all consolidated in one place for guildies

I’m not planning to take off but I would never care if someone else did

The true pathetic and disgusting behavior Is judging someone else’s choices in their life that you know nothing about

Brokentooth will have his 1.0 attack speed in Classic 😀👍

Also make sure your bags are not full. Sometimes I auto loot and don’t read the red text that says it and assume it went into my bags
---
I find it amusing that you insult others for wasting time yet you spend your “precious” minutes talking down to people here on Reddit. Don’t you need to go beat your kid for getting a B+ on their last math test or smack your wife for not wearing the right shade of lipstick. You are pathetic. Go do something already!

If you are more invested than your friends than you should have no problem keeping up with them as a warrior. Also you can play the game however you want but the hamstring method is a little weird to me. I never did it back in the day and i didn't know anyone else who did, if you're really trying to min/max and level as fast as possible then i guess its the way to go but a warrior in mail/plate should be fine taking some hits.
---
it's 100% true back in real vanilla.  I don't think any pally has tested it on beta though although they could test it with 1/5 reck at level 30.
---
Yeah those crafty bastards... never know when they are gonna change something just cause.
---
The biggest issue with these sub-optimal specs is that theres barely any upgrades for them in raids and a lot of the items that are upgrades should be prio for other classes as they scale a lot better with gear, my advice would be to raid as healer and gear up your off spec with items others dont need, especially during progress. Once things are on farm just talk to the officers and see if you can transition over to whatever meme spec you want.
---
Sounds like this guy really needed a second monitor
---
What you don't understand is that we're not only looking for bugs. We're looking for things that were not in Vanilla, okay? That wasn't, so someone mentions it. Then Blizz decides if it stays or not, but at least they know. End of story.
---
The mounts were removed when BWL launched.
---
BWL is going to launch in Classic ~3 months after launch.
---
99% of players will not be 60 and able to afford an epic mount by then.
---
I'm confident I could buy the mount(s). I just don't want them in the game.
---
Just like it worked in vanilla, based on lots of posts from past months in this sub.
---
My fellow WoW homies are actually just crackheads with more steps.
---
plz explain how you are unable to understand simple English.
---
I can’t remwmber the name of the quest, but there was one in Darkshore where you had to escort someone and when you get to the Ashenvale border, you are greeted with NPCs there to stop him. It was the first quest that felt like a special event to me.
---
Getting 3 gems and forgetting to loot Serpentis is the worst. Pretty sure I've done it multiple times, too.
---
This is blowing my mind and making me sad as well
---
Aw man I miss these.  Thanks for the throwback.
---
Pugging probably won't be wide spread early on. Level any toon you want casually. As you and others reach 60, hardcore people will have alts up and start leading pug raids on their off nights. Hopefully with a core of players from their guild.
---
Just be prepared and make friends with a few people who run these groups. Then you have the hookup when you are available and have a selection of different raid times to choose from.
---
Personally I started vanilla ~ 8mo from BC release. Most of my raiding was pugging with a few guilds that ran raids, but didnt have the numbers to avoid pugging. It worked well, I could chose between different days based on my schedule any given week. 
---
Actually randomly ran into one of the raid leaders on the stress test. He started a guild with the same name and I got a random invite. Saw the GL was the exact same guy leading their pugs back in the day. Pretty cool. And I suspect with pugging alone you should be able to work towards AQ and Naxx, though clearing I would think unlikely even years down the road...but who knows.
---
Ah yeah! Makes sense. I'd hope that layer shifting wouldn't occur when in combat, not that I like layers in the first place though.
---
You’ll probably never know. The beta is too busy following asmongold around and fucking around.
---
From a story perspective, this content is pigeon-holing as it becomes less of 'your story' and there being no overarching narrative, except the one you create to "oh lets kill this flavour of big bag this expansion", if they added this content with a level cap situated at 60, then it could potentially work, but I'd say that it would be more fun exploring new areas of lore that haven't been explored properly in the main series. 
---
I've been involved in the private server scene (player and administrator) since the days of Ascent, and before ArcEmu existed, so around mid 2007. Here is a screenshot of some of my profile from a popular WoW Emulation Website, that I used to be a major part of. [I'd say a lot of people here found their way to that website in their time, through the Jarqs Repacks] https://imgur.com/nSSAS9V ) The main reason people were able to play for so long is the resets. Its fun racing to max, and being the first guild on the server to complete certain tiers, etc. and the constant rolling release of new servers that stagger their content. When your bored of one, find a fresh one. Retail Classic wont have this, as they wont roll out fresh servers, they'll be struggling to keep their current ones alive after a year or so.
---
People can also play TBC and Wrath on private servers, hell -- thats how I started with private servers, was TBC.
---
yeah they did. a shield is just block chance and about 5-8% damage reduction (give or take depending on the level of the shield and what level range you are). (and vs 5 enemies you ain't shield-blocking shit, so that's not a concern).
---
Depending on your other gear it was entirely possible (a warrior can easily have 45-53% DR with gear + Defensive stance) and was often done because you generate more rage and were able to burn through quicker that way. (also at higher gear levels you were over-mitigated and couldn't generate rage and had to strip some pieces to get it down to a level you could actually tank with).
---
You needed to know your healer could handle it but that was the only concern. (aka you need discuss it with them before you do it, since how you heal will be different from how you'd heal a Shield user. You heal more like you're healing a bear druid instead of a warrior).
---
And yes...even from Day 1, people could even tank without being tanks. You wanted a dedicate in a raid. But you often took what you could get for 5-mans. Hunter pets, Warlock pets, Demo-Locks, enhancement shamans, ROGUES(which apparently the meeting stone algorithm decided was an acceptable tank for my random 5 man group), Spriests, Anything with about 30-ish%-50% DR (or defensive cool-downs of sufficient usability to get the job done) and a bunch of health and able to deal sufficient threat to keep enemies off the healers.
---
Source?
---
Yeah this is a constant problem in WC for me
---
It eventually got to the point that I just turned combat text off all together and exclusively used a DPS meter to gauge my damage.
---
I think the last time I saw floating combat text was late Cataclysm.
---
Plus, in order to make those assumptions I'd have to see another player in retail so it's a non-issue
---
Yes, just meet up somewhere and quest from there. Someone will have to travel a lot though.
---
You sure are smug and look like an Ass in your response. Your answer is no more right than another persons. However, please go about your day up there on your high horse and don't take a week off of work, I don't want you tagging my mobs anyway
---
Would it be the fact that two people explode and die on a regular basis?  It becomes an RDPS check.
---
Not sure. I know at some point they removed the center version korrak and the troll invasion and just moved them all to the graveyard. Perhaps thats what you are remembering? thats like 1.8 av or some thing
---
Druids are really good at 1v1s, and open world PvP. A good hybrid druid that can kite and burst well is very powerful. Not the easiest to gear, definitely not the easiest to pull off, but they can be very formidable duelists, and probably have more "comeback" stories than mages or warlocks do.
---
And then changed to 4 stacks, alowwing a total of 5 attacks (4 stacks + the regular attack). I think that's what /u/atresj is asking
---
He’s not trolling.  He’s an insufferable jackass.
---
They said a while back they were approaching the number of testers they needed for the time being. I’m assuming that means more at a later date but sounds like it’s unlikely at the moment
---
I thought I'd played vanilla for most of the existence, but there was so much I forgot/didn't see, I wasn't sure... turns out my account was created December 3, 2004, holy shit.
---
Good on you if you can revert your brain to appreciate the classic effort reward system. Not everyone will be able to.
---
Super encouraged! Thanks.
---
Druid is extremely good at 1v1's and open world (because you can pick fights and almost always run away). Obviously their downside is they lack burst damage but they make up for it in a lot of ways. you should check out Ebbnflow on YT for more info on druids.

So what? You are still implying that not being able to get a specific skin mount is "alienating," which is the part that I take issue with. I'm 100% sure I will never get the mount, because it isn't my priority on launch. Why should I give a fuck if someone else wants to go for it and get it? How is that hurting me in any way?

Nice let me know if you find it, I'll never turn down a dose of nostalgia. I was with CryHavoc during ToC (that's what the place was called right?) so I probably joined just after that
---
It is possible, but someone will need to do a lot of running. Best thing to do would be just t get to level 10-12-ish and then meet up and head to westfall.
---
agreed. or if OP for some reason can't do that, appoint a person to be a proper raid leader who has all the info down and prepped.
---
Tips is that you???
---
Hi, /u/tajiulol
---
Damn. For someone who seems to have it all together "wife and kids etc." Youre suuuuper judgemental about how others spend their vacation time... Some jobs give out 7 weeks paid vacation. Using one of those weeks to play a game you may have waited 12 years for seems reasonable to me as long as you dont let it interfere with your personal life. 
---
I think its even more "sad and amusing" that you give a fuck what others do with their time.

Doesn't make you less of an Ass

---
you are lucky, same thing happened to me, and they couldn't recover the character, since it was transferred to another account, not just another server.
---
It works different on a pserver (way easier to do). But even on those posts there were people presenting the "sitbatching" theory and providing video evidence about that, way before the beta
---
They'll know the difference.
---
We will have to wait until they let someone other than twitch zoomers trying to floss dance on stream
---
Lupos was "nerfed" in 1.9, so it's likely that he won't do shadow damage in the classic 1.12 version.
---
Wew lad.
---
The last time I raised my hand to a female was on the playground and my kid is doing very well in school. I like how you assume I'm both a tiger mom and a wife beater in the same sentence. Lots to unpack here.
---
I got my second highest upvoted post ever from this sub because I posted about a noob warlock mistake I made. There were a few haters but I think overall not too many people are that bad. 
---
The toxic people will be too busy no lifing so they can gank lowbies.
---
Yes it did work in vanilla, it's just harder to do than just sitting.
---
the problem is that the world buffs were on a cooldown in vanilla.  You'd have multiple guilds turning onys head in weekly for example and that head would stay there for a while I don't remember the exact timing.  If someone else turned in during that time there was no buff given out.  
---
So early on, say for mc/bwl the logistics of getting everyone full world buffs just isn't reliable as other guilds will be turning in the quests putting them on a realm wide cd.  By the time we got to KT very few guilds were doing ony so it was much more feasible to plan around the buff.
---
Can someone ELI5 here and give the significance?
---
This isn’t supposed to work on white crits and sitting/standing makes it work? Does that just mean it’s easier to get it to pop since white crits are more frequent?
---
They can say that, but they know internally where the numbers are actually coming from.
---
No, it doesn't.
---
Doesn't take much time or effort for Gnomes/Humans/Dwarfs to get to each others starting zones.  I always play gnome, but make the trek to the human starting area each time and go from there.  Gnome/Dwarf go to IF tram to SW,   Human just go reverse.
---
I think the decisions just were not coordinated. By the time the Vanilla mania surrounding Nostalrius appeared Reforged might not even have been seriously considered. The Warcraft III Blizzard invitational that accompanied the release of the first major patch for WC3 (preparing ground for Reforged) happened late February last year, so after Classic was already in the works for quite some time. We don't know when exactly did the basic modernisation efforts of WC3 turn into plans for a full-scale rework, but it is possible that it was only in early 2018 that the final decision was made.
---
The game hasn't even launched yet and already we are infested with cries of "some of us don't have time to play, we should get cool stuff too!" Please, for the love of god, stick to retail if that's going to be your attitude.
---
robe of the void for mage? surely you mean robe of the archmage :)
---
Looking forward to "1% crit" instead of "37 crit rating" (or whatever the fuck it is).
---
or comments that start with "Imagine"
---
Yes, but it should work in vanilla (before they fixed it)
---
Lupus was nerfed in patch 1.9, and snarler had the magic resist removed in 1.3, so both will not have the special abilities in classic.
---
Brokentooth will have the 1.0 attack speed though.
---
Haven't really. The thought I'd alliance shamans still sicken me to this day.  Box caved to the horde crying for pallies.  Alliance was like "We never asked for this."
---
To your knowledge, does windfury not proc itself in the version of the game we are getting in classic?
---
The thing that is missing here is the quite high chance that people do actually remember things correctly and that elite mob damage was actually stealth nerfed before 1.12.  Most people remember leveling in classic long before 1.12 patch.  If this was the case then clearly blizzard should look at restoring the pre-nerf values rather than the 1.12 values, however with them only having 1.12 as a reference I'd doubt we'll ever be able to verify this case.
---
Yupp! Aside from that the smaller obligations include (depending on how serious of a guild you are) monitoring consumable usage, constructing the raid in a manner that ensures all pertinent buffs/debuffs have 100% uptime, monitoring attendance, monitoring applications, ect.
---
A lot goes into it, having experienced officers that alleviate some of the burden helps
---
Retail wow sucks, just accept it.
---
Dude y’all should play Diablo 3. You can crit in the BILLIONS. It’s so hard to process and actually feel badass. Also, randomly, I remember in FF7 when I started hitting MFers for 9999 I knew I had ascended lol
---
Thanks! Will do
---
I definitely wouldn't be the leader - I never got to raid classic, only TBC. Although having said that I am someone is okay with putting in massive amounts of work to learn things, so I might be okay in being a group leader within a raid, or something along those lines. The friend who suggested making a guild is more experience so I would imagine he would be leader, or his brother. 
---
Are there any other support roles that I could fill if I can't be the guild leader?
---
Do you feel enhancement or elemental is easier to gear for? Or which starts to feel more powerful early?
---
Asaki! That’s a name I remember. I’m Eldro/Elarrion. We raided together, didn’t we?
---
100% CD keys are enough, i did it recently.
---
I usually don’t like to judge people based on their looks but this guy is absolutely disgusting.
---
You are not very smart are you?
---
me2
---
Pretty much anything under $60 for immediate beta access and I'd pay it without a second thought.
---
Have you looked at the Kick animation for Undead Rogues? Stupid as fuck.
---
Fuckin champion
---
One kid, and I choose my life. It's mostly wonderful but certainly has ups/downs. Very little is dictated to me beyond my taxes (REEEEE) and bills. I'm not salty about anything, I said this behavior was amusing. You're acting aggressive and salty, I'm just acting mean spirited and judgmental.
---
Wtf this is great for the nochanges people! I want this, this is classic and "balancing" would ruin it.
---
Tailoring may *seem* difficult to take advantage of, but it really, really isn't (for gearing up, anyways). Patterns for Robe of the Archmage aren't *usually* too expensive, and put you in front pretty early on. You're going to be getting a bunch of cloth leveling up regardless, so it's smart to do something with it.
---
Personally, I've never found enchanting to be super lucrative. Maybe I just don't know how to work it, but to me the greatest advantage of enchanting is being able to disenchant, which in classic WoW any level 5 who trained enchanting can do. You never really get too much money from enchanting other people's stuff too, and (as you mentioned) getting enchanting formulas can be expensive and time-consuming. 
---
I would suggest going with tailoring and herbalism or mining, and get good at fishing, because you can make quite a bit of money from fish used for raid consumables.
---
Hybrid enthusiast here to help weigh in :). Some pros and cons for each, in a nutshell:
---
Druid:
---
\+ Good itemization for both healing and feral while leveling
---
\+ Decent damage in cat form w/ the right gear
---
\+ Multiple forms/resource bars allows you to really maximize spirit and work around the regen rule
---
\+ Great mobility w/ travel and aquatic forms
---
\- Has a hard time playing a combo healer/tank role (you're squishy when not in bear form)
---
\- Higher skill ceiling to effectively use all your tools
---
\- Tanking kit in a silo feels a bit anemic, but gets the job done
---
Paladin:
---
\+ More engaging gameplay as a tank (if you go into Prot)
---
\+ Easier to play a combo healer/tank role (maintain full armor while healing)
---
\+ Excellent utility with blessings, judged seals, bubble
---
\- Hard to find int mail/plate while leveling - using leather/cloth mitigates the bonus of being able to wear heavier armor
---
\- Tanking is mana intensive, need to be mindful
---
\- Damage is anemic unless you go into ret and itemize correctly
---
They're both excellent hybrid classes that bring a ton to the table and can effectively do all roles well throughout the leveling process if you prepare. You mentioned you're fine with pivoting to a more healer centric role for raiding, which is good, and the bonus here is that you don't even really need to fully devote yourself to a healing role talent wise for these classes if you don't want to. Back in the day I was a 20-0-31 ret/holy hybrid that went down into holy for illumination, but no further. Anything after that's just gravy, and isn't really needed for your role as a healer.
---
The best thing about playing these classes is the flexibility they offer - for Druid, they have a higher floor for performing all roles and can do so at the drop of a hat. Even in caster gear you'll have a big butt and all of the needed tools when you swap to bear, in particular. Paladin can do everything at once, but gear is a bigger factor for them and they need more preparation in targeting which roles they want to fill ahead of time.
---
Both roles can fill damage with backup heals quite well - Druid does this with feral and omen of clarity for free heals, and Paladin's main source of damage comes from itemization and Seal of Command with select windows for burst as needed.
---
Lupos does not do shadow damage. Brokentooth has 1.0 attack speed.
---
There will be new players. Private server drama turned me off when I was around 30 after I started again, then blizz announced classic and I wanted to hold off. A couple of my friends are the same way, not private server players, but can't wait to chill and enjoy the experience for the long haul
---
It'd be a goal for the future, way future. It's honestly just for the aesthetics of the outfit, lol. So yeah, won't expect to get it aaaanytime soon or even the full set.
---
dats da skeel
---
As a Dwarf player, I have only the utmost respect for Trolls. Y'all are chill.
---
The difficult part is that mage AoE grinding is based around them not taking any damage, by kiting the mobs into a pack and then freezing and outranging.
---
With a paladin, you're looking at face tanking them, which could be pretty rough. The advantage is that you *might* be able to do a greater variety of mobs, since you won't be as screwed by casters/range as solo mages are. However, the mage frost grinding is pretty set in stone, and I don't think you'll be able to speed it up. However, mages can AoE pretty well on their own by 22, so duo shouldn't be any worse:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZZV0MhR
---
What I would do is try to find areas where you can get 2 huge packs by having both the paladin and mage pulling, then meet in the middle and have the mage root them while you pop consecration. Mage backs up and blizzards, and you use paladin heals/bubbles/consecration for some extra damage and protection to get bigger/higher level packs. You'll be hard pressed to level both faster than a mage could solo, but the paladin will be leveling way faster than on their own.
---
Man I completely forgot about the trams!
---
We lost open world difficulty and dungeon difficulty, both of which are huge stepping stones to building a social network inside WoW and getting your toes wet for harder content.
---
You're questing and blast out a message to see if anyone else is going to finish up their group/elite quests, now you've got a few players you might add to your friends list. Then later on you might want to try joining or forming a group for the dungeon at the end of the zone you're working on, and once again you're meeting new players and building connections.
---
With the way the game is now you can just 100% solo and not have interactions with a single other player until the day you decide to try stepping into M+ or join a Heroic+ guild. That's WAY too big a leap and is going to create a huge divide in the playerbase.
---
If you gently force some grouping and friend making by having a more difficult world and baseline dungeons, you create a smoother and more captivating MMO experience overall. The most avid players of WoW are all the ones who are deep into competitive PvP, M+, Heroic raiding.
---
When you make a game that's easy as hell to pick up, you make a game that's easy as hell to put down as well.
---
Wait, people are against paying a sub for classic? 
---
So.. they just want it for free?
---
They did that one time. You bought a year of WoW and you got beta to MoP. It didn't turn out very well for Blizz because they had to do it in waves because of the massive amount of people who wanted in. People were throwing tantrums on the forums about it. I doubt Blizz would ever do that again.
---
yeah for sure
---
D3 is out of control
---
Rogues get no debuff slots typically.  So you are instant poision only, combat swords, combat daggers, or assa daggers.  Hemo typically not allowed.  
---
You are giving up damage to downrank, for dps there is concept of overhealing.  Damage that you cannot give up and stay competitive.  You would also need an exceptionally high amount of spell power to have enough that your downranked spells still did noticeable damage.  Realize +healing is cheaper on the stat budget weight as +damage so it is far easier to stack to high numbers.
---
In my opinion, play what you want. Polls are fun, but I don't believe they are an accurate representation of the overall population. Even if people are excited to play Mage, it doesn't mean they will all make it to 60, and even if they do, Mage is such a sought after class that I doubt you will have too much difficulty finding groups especially if you're decent, and it sounds like you are. Hope that helps :)
---
I think people forget... people in the beta are not getting a head start. They’ll have to start all over again on release. 
---
Only thing people from BETA get is more time to get bored of the game.
---
For dem keeds
---
I definitely don't have it all together, I wouldn't dare even pretend. Only one kid, and I'm definitely super judgmental. You're free to think what you will.
---
yeah I really dont like the artificial feel of "ratings"
---
oh man, I miss WoW on my two 6800gt's in SLI.
---
Imo it is easier to reach a fun pvp stage as enhance, as you just need a good, slow weapon to start messing people up.
---
The only pure ele set is T 2.5 and D 0.5, which takes some time to get.
---
I have weeks to take off, I already have two summer holidays planned this summer, one with my girlfriend and one with my group of friends, I'm sorry that your significant other probably pulls the plug on your computer when she wants 'quality time' but mine understands i have other interests and hobbys :)
---
I absolutely wanna do this, too. But I didn't do much max-level pvp until after BGs, and then spent a shit-load of time in AB... I hope I can take my time and still get in on the max-level phase two world-pvp madness... sadly, I doubt it, but I'd rather take my time leveling and risk that. Plus, there's plenty of world-pvp fun to be had with others at my level range, got fond memories of small-scale battles with other 20s in Stonetalon from back in the day, for instance.
---
A horde player acting weak and not like a proud warrior, pitiful.
---
That's ideal.
---
Spending too much time with someone isn't a good thing. Burnout is a real thing.
---
Gods I was strong then!
---
That's a great point, the competing for gear. Didn't really cross my mind since I figured I'd be wearing more a mix of the other armors while he got the majority of the plate. Thanks :D
---
Probably better off doing the starting areas and then just meeting up.  Whoever does the running will probably gain a level or 2 through map exploration experience anyways.
---
Yeah it does, if you can't see that it's your problem. Shows a lack of character to not be able to recognize when you are being a dick to others. Now, recognize I never suggested your free speech be curtailed. Im telling you, your comment was rude in general and you're being an ass.
---
Don't do this before level 10. Your class quests won't be at the other player's zone, nor will your trainer (if you pick a class not available to the other races).
---
well, there ya go i guess. Spirit is broken as fuck on warrs.  
---
Theres a reason warrs got a huge spirit nerf after vanilla while nobody else was touched.  
---
If you go back to my orig post in this thread, i briefly explain how to stack the stuff easily.
---
What a shitty thing to say.  Man you are unlikeable.
---
2004 account, subbed since 2004, no beta.
---
One of the few 2% that made it that far :O
---
You don't have to defend yourself, bud. I wasn't calling you out directly.
---
I would go with Priest, they're more focused on healing and are generally a more engaging healer in 5 mans as well as raids compared to shaman.
---
In raids shaman healing tends to lean on chain heal and down ranked healing wave as your main casts and keeping totems up as your other priority.
---
So great!  Much thanks for taking the time to share your experience!
---
I mean the hunter is basically a support class in raids. So if we tell him he needs to wing clip. He needs to wing clip. Otherwise we can find a hunter who will. Hunters are for pulling, kiting, atk buffing, and NF carrying. Not leet ranged dps. That being said I am sure plenty of guilds will allow for that. I doubt top guilds will though. When I was considering playing a hunter getting a NF was a part of my goal structure.
---
I didn't bother reposting the other threads people made with proof showing the differences, they just get dismissed with the, "No, Blizzard check the 1.12 reference they got from Nost and its all good" line.
---
And the answer is always: ITS THE INTERNET, YOURE NEVER THE ONLY ONE.
---
Ah yes, the Goku power curve. Will be nice to see it back to Dragonball levels.
---
yeah its basically "lazy" game design, just increase mob HP and increase damage players can do with better gear, quite dumb
---
Wanna share that beta key? Lol.
---
Healing in dungeons can be done by any healing class (druid just has the disadvantage of needing another resser class in the group).
---
You won't be as efficient as priests, but your totems can really help speed things up, especially if you have a melee group.
---
Edit: In my experience totem management also brings some more variety to it, as you have to choose which totems are best based on your group or a specific encounter.
---
well, you can be a guild leader and not a raid leader, there's nothing to say you absolutely have to be both. if yu have a good reliable team of officers to help with stuff you arent comfy with then it will be just fine.
---
to me the most important thing for a guild leader is to foster a good community, help those who need it when you can and handle any disputes without bias. be fair and grow as a team and your friends and guild will flourish.
---
That’s so cool! I played on Argent Dawn from like march 2005. I remember you (and Romanov!) and The Flaming Ruby. My name was Eldor (rogue) and Elarrion (paladin). 
---
Jordi, from the PvP screenshot, was my first guildmaster. So fun to see your screenshots. I lost all my WoW-screenshots in a PC crash :( - would love to see what others you have!
---
I had forgotten about that Garrosh thing! I guess they got scared of technical constraints reigning in their encounter design.
---
we all have to be honest.
---
Rolled a hunter in vanilla and loved it. Had my comeback on Nostalrius just in the same way, as I loved it all over again :)
---
Now maining priest as I like healing and as alt I have a rouge, cause I never played that class ever before
---
Seems to be worth it for valve and others. Ofc those companies sell their games at a price on EU and NA to not have to rely on smaller regions to make a profit. Blizzard does it too. You can bet that our subs already pay for the servers while making a good amount of profit. The subs from those regions would essentially be free money? But you know what is better than free money? More free money. Since blizzard charges them EU prices i guess its better for them to have 100k subs at 15€ than having 200k at 5€. Is it better for the gamers around the world? Or for the game itself? No, but its better for their bank account.
---
And im actually on the other side of the spectrum. I live in switzerland, a tich country where everyone can afford a sub, ofc we use the EU servers but do you think Blizzard has regional priçes for switzerland? Of course not, the difference in price wouldnt be that big of a deal but by not having them they can charge us that tiny bit more.
---
Simply not possible in vanilla? I fucking rogue tanked WC multiple times. I've done a full WC clear with a Hunter pet tanking. Sorry, dude, the vanilla 5 mans were pretty damn easy up to the 55-60 ones.
---
&gt; can they not just use downranked spells like healers or does that just do no damage?
---
Ehh, yes, maybe, but not really. If you're well buffed with better gear than the content you're facing, you can make it work with mana potions and extra consumables, but don't expect it to be easy.
---
&gt; With only 16 debuffs I assume that means certain classes will not be allowed to use their debuffs correct? So a feral wouldn't be able to rake/rip, locks can only use CoE, and what about rogues?
---
Yup. Rogues (if I remember correctly) alternate between keeping slice and dice up and using evicerate on downtime as combat, and use instant poisons. The debuff limit prevents a lot of DoT classes from taking full advantage of their spells, but remember this is really only in single-target (raid boss) scenarios. For virtually everything up to that point (adds, trash mobs, 5 man bosses and mobs, all NPCs through leveling) you can use DoTs.
---
So, I'll start this by saying that at the beginning everyone will want to lead their own guild. There will be maybe 4-10 guilds on each faction that will be noticeably successful. These guilds will usually have some of the highest level players racing to 60 with 1-2 guilds having 40%+ of the higher levels. You'll have a lot of random guild names running around and most will eventually turn into alt guilds if not disbanded. A few months in you'll have 20-30 raiding guilds on each faction typically.
---
If I were personally going to create a guild I would only do it as a casual guild.
---
If you want to raid, successfully, here are few things to know about running a guild:
---
1. You must have the time AND the personality to lead and manage a large group of people. You need to know how to analyze when an issue arises (it will) if the issue is truly an issue or is it just someone complaining?
---
2. I you will need 1-2/3 competent people able to lead raids. These people need to know how to speak clearly and command your voice room without (most of the time) being an asshole (occasionally it's required for certain people). They need to be the most knowledgeable about a fight in the raid.
---
3. To go a long with #1 you need to have a basic understanding of the social aspects of a guild. Understand that cliques will form and that making a rash decision on one member can cause an entire group of people to sour/leave.
---
4. You'll want to lay out a plan for loot distribution as well as identifying your best players in each class as the class leaders.
---
5. You need to be able to make decisions objectively.
---
These are a few things. There is a lot to go with running a guild that people don't think about. You need to have a plan if you want it to be successful. People want organization. 
---
Once you've got trusted officers/class leaders and whatnot you can kind of start cruising unless an issue comes up, but getting to that point takes time.
---
As for websites and programs I will leave that for someone more current on the game.
---
Hope this helps and isn't just wild rambling to you.
---
I see what your saying but there's nothing preventing people from making new characters if that's what they want. I guess at a certain point years down the road the low level population might be really low as everyone's capped but it is what it is. One thing they could do later on to keep people playing is scale all the dungeons up to max level, would basically quadruple the number of max level dungeons. 
---
I hope that they do Classic BC and just let us mirror our characters and level them up to 70, but still be able to hop back on classic and have that character at 60.
---
I was one of those moonkins.  People pointed and laughed.   I was such a noob that I didn't even know why.
---
Yeah, they are called guilds, and you can find them on the guild recruitment page on the classic wow discord on the sidebar.
---
I mean you were, directly or indirectly.
---
What people do with their spare time or holidays is completely up to you, some people might take a week off to go watch birds in a tree somewhere, some might go on a beach holiday, some might play their favourite video game for a week straight, all valid.
---
stop caring about other peoples lives bro.
---
Yup! Haha, thanks for the catch.
---
I want survivability in pvp. I enjoy world questing and dungeons here and there, but I really hate raiding.... I wouldn't mind suffering through some raids for the gear (for pvp sake) 
---
I'm thinking lock... but all other classes are still up to be picked so Idk.
---
I like priest just for the MC though
---
Such a dumb stance. They have literally said they have a desired population number, there's no way this guy is that dumb to not understand basic math
---
 #1, and #2 most recruited classes on horde, so no issue finding raid groups.  
---
Priest is more of a pure healer, and is only dispel on horde.  Shaman is more of a pure support, that can spec into healing.  Shaman will do a lot of non-healing stuff even as resto, like totem management and if some cases shocking for interrupts.  Other then chainheal, the other two shaman heals are very like priest flash heal=lesser healing wave, and greater heal=healing wave.  Priest typically do those abilities better, so shamans focus on chainheal for any aoe fight.
---
*calculator
---
Herbalism / alchemy does okay no matter what and even without the rare recipes will be useful to you and allow you to make a profit. 
---
I’d skip enchanting if you’ll be behind the curve. It can be a real money sink to level and the rare recipes are what makes the most money. 
---
I think Tailoring is still a solid choice. If you won’t raid much then there are some good gear options you can make for yourself. 
---
Tailoring and herbalism is probably a good combo which will give you some benefit and enable you to make money. Alchemy is better from a pure money making perspective though.
---
There used to be a stickied post about future guilds, but tbh the best way to find a guild is in game.
---
Ment starting freah servers with a cap at 20 or 30 and then raising by 10 every month until 60 then progress as normal. Or something similar
---
You're right, while we are at it they should just hand out free t2 because we wouldn't not the have-nots to feel bad......
---
I was the 1% that played EverQuest for years before WoW starting at the age of 11. Most kids didn’t even have access to internet or PCs back then. We had one phone line for dial up and if I was on EQ you couldn’t call my house.
---
I watched WoW for years before it launched and played a lot of closed beta. I was obsessed after playing through WC3 campaign and reading the War of the Ancients trilogy.
---
I went into WoW with that experience and went on to compete for world first racing in AQ40 and through sheer 99% raid attendance became the most geared Mage on my server by a mile.  Raiding 40+ hours a week took a toll. I dropped out from burnout right before my guild downed world first Loatheb. RIP.
---
Still on my beta account. I thought vanilla was pretty easy compared to EQ which I played thousands of hours. So to me it seemed easy.
---
And that’s my story.
---
Trillions. It's pretty rediculous
---
I was 100% noob. Got my account perma-banned before I even got my ‘main’ to level 40. I spent hundreds of hours trash talking on channels and ./spit on people.
---
the original power creep lol
---
it is exactly as artificial as armor for example..
---
They are also availble through playing the game and socializing with other players.
---
Only because DM = Dire Maul. It's a difficult argument either way lol. Generally back in the day we called it VC on ally skullcrusher
---
He is  staying something everyone already knows it’s just the people who didn’t get in don’t want to hear it.
---
10
---
Exactly!
---
And, it turns out that some mobs hit for 2 more damage than on pservers - 2. And at those levels, 2 damage per swing means something.
---
Can you send a link to the discord I can’t find it. Plz.
---
I tend not to mind it in D3. With infinitely scaling enemies, the exact damage numbers are pretty fluid and meaningless anyway. What more matters is how many hits it takes to kill certain enemies, which is an easily countable and understandable stat. The numbers flying around are pretty much just another spell effect.
---
This is such a small thing, but it was one of my favourite things about the game.
---
I still remember the first time I took the Zeppelin from UC to Org and getting buffs from the other people waiting for it to arrive. WoW was my first MMO, and that was the moment I realised this game was going to be like nothing I'd ever played before.
---
I'll never understand why Blizzard gutted class buffs.
---
Tier 2 armor will eventually be available to all players of the game, no matter when they started playing or how long it takes them to get to 60.
---
It has occurred to other streamers though. Like Asmongold last night while they were fighting giants in Azshara. Everything despawned while they were fighting and then a bunch of stuff respawned on top of them.
---
Although we’ll be leveling together, I’m gonna have one toon that is meant for dual leveling and then one I’m going to be leveling on my own time bc he’s gonna be busier than I am. Maybe warlock/mate together and rogue solo?
---
But in this version don’t you have to be on the same realm since no phasing
---
More then one way to define it.  Pure duelling tourament, and rdruid is average to bad.  
---
World pvp ganking/counter ganking rdruid is a god.  The difference here is druids can get away from any class and no class can get away from a druid, so as a druid you get to pick which fights to take.  
---
That being said, I wouldn't play rdruid as a 1v1 class.  It is much better as a support, that merely has some 1v1 potential.  If you are 1v1ing only, druid is probably not optimal.
---
Oh look, people who can't accept the fact that other people might like different games or certain things about different games.
---
Brats
---
You have to be flexible if you want to be an off meta spec regardless of the situation.
---
To avoid this thread becoming an echo chamber I’ll provide examples of situations I’ve seen:
---
-If you’re on a boss and the obvious issue is the healing and your elemental/enchancement shaman refuses to assist, boot that piece of shit for someone else.
---
-If your guild is struggling to put 40 together, they’ll make sacrifices and snag some less-than-desirable specced people.
---
-If you’re pushing world 1st, hybrids wont be allowed unless they’re designed for a specific role (I remember seeing feral/Reston builds for fast and easy yet sub-optimal switching).
---
-If your guild is populated with potential and on farm content, there’s no reason a hybrid specced character should really be held up.
---
I distinctly remember a new player in vanilla screaming broken English in trade chat "HOW CAN MAKE FEARIE??!"
---
To this day my brother and our friends refer to it as such
---
Yeah I prefer organic armor lol
---
Crazy how if you’re famous you get access to things the common people don’t. Someone call CNN, they need to hear this world breaking news.
---
Female undead
---
I was agreeing with you. "No, doing so does not make me any less of an ass." You are correct. 
---
I was being an ass and have no problem admitting as much.
---
undead prob has the best caster animations too
---
14. God damn that was forever ago
---
Dont judge others' choices for how they choose to spend their free time. You're calling others selfish and pathetic. For what? What is possibly selfish about someone taking time off from work to do something they enjoy? Are you implying that your time off is worth substantially more because its spent with your wife and kid? And who is judging that worth, yourself? Lol for your kid's sake I hope it actually matures instead of peaking where you left off at 16 or so
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe rogues could use axes in Vanilla. 
---
If that's true, wouldn't it negate a good amount of the benefit of playing an orc versus an undead?
---
This one has more commercials in it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEV4GqQF_3A
---
Rank 14 gear is off limits to most players in the game. So are legendaries and Scarab Lord. This logic that we should only let anyone have things that are obtainable to everyone is ridiculous.
---
HAha BfA bad. 
---
Classic good.
---
Sure, but it's still fun to be overpowered in world pvp. It's even more shocking to people questing around because you totally obliterate them.
---
&gt;I see myself pulling a bunch of mobs, popping consecration, building up a little aggro, and then he unleashes aoe
---
You underestimate how hard things hit back then, how little damage your characters did, how much HP mobs have, and how little HP you have.  Even as you get close to lvl 60, taking on 2 normal equal level mobs at the same time can be pretty difficult.  For just 3, you would for sure have to pop all your big cooldowns and probably pot as well.  The trick to aoe grinding is to not take any damage at all, not to stand in the middle tanking 10+ mobs.  You wouldn't last more than 3 seconds trying to face tank 5+ mobs.
---
Technically you don't have a quiver equipt.
---
Lol I had a friend lose it on me in discord because I kept doing it. He started laughing after and said "man that was some stupid shit hahaha"
---
revert my brain? i stopped playing MMOs because my brain never changed, the system did!
---
orc is the best race for pve, due to blood fury. also, 25% stun resist is wild for pvp
---
I totally agree. I just wish my memory was better. I remember some of the people I met and guilds I were in, but it’s hard to remember all!
---
Everyone should go to vanillafriends.com and register their AD character.
---
Yes, once learned, lock picking works like weapon skills. Your max lockpick skill is Level*5, with a five skill point cap increase each time you level.
---
Unfortunately, just like weapon skills, the higher your current lock picking skill, the less likely you are too get a skill up. This was one if the big reasons you'd see rogues offering free lock picking in trade. They were doing their damnedest to try to make their skill.
---
then you should not play on release cause thats whats gonna happen ;D
---
Ahh, cheers then lol
---
I don't have a wife or kids.
---
I'd rather play classic WoW for a week than to travel.
---
How is that selfish or disgusting? Different people are in different situations and different preferences for entertainment.
---
Scarab Lord is the only exception to your argument, as it will eventually be removed too. So yeah, remove Scarab Lord from Classic.
---
Yes and yes, the stun resist was of more interest to me. But really, it all comes down to vanity and aesthetics.
---
The joke is that Killerduki is the leader of a guild that encourages these kinds of speccs. I'm sure the maker is aware that paladins/shamans are faction restricted. 
---
I actually healed a BRD run with Killerduki a couple of years ago. He tanked as a paladin and had his melee survival hunter friend dpsing.
---
ok
---
Thank you for the clarification.
---
I'm glad aoe looting isn't being included.
---
Yet the +1% Crit was a dead end going forward.
---
I would rather keep the +1% but tbh Crit rating was a good way to keep it working - or like Warframe where your Crit Can Crit (capped at 300% but with a 2x Crit damage and 150% Crit chance 50% of your attacks will deal 2x damages, and the other 50% 4x damages)
---
I don't think WoW is taillored for the Warframe Crit system but it could've been an option.
---
If you had said you were going to spend a week bird watching I would also have thought that was an amusing waste of time. Is something forcing me to say as much? No, not at all. Would saying so be unnecessary and cause me to be flamed by a bunch of triggered manchildren? Almost certainly. Would I care? Not one bit.
---
Don't tell me what to do, bro. You're so important to me. You are my whole world. I'm nothing without you.
---
25.
---
Binding totems and engi items really stacks up.
---
I feel you. I find vaping pretty gross myself. I think Streamers in general should be more aware of the shit they make their viewers hear, let alone them vaping.
---
I’m between rogue, warrior, and hunter currently.
---
I have maxed all of them multiple times on retail, but since I’m a wrath-baby I feel like this will obviously be all new to me. My reasoning is as follows.
---
Rogue- from what I can tell they’re amazing dps and obviously pvp and also wpvp gods if you get good and get geared. A con I’m seeing is that they seem pretty rough in solo pve and also of course they can only be dps.
---
Warrior- can be amazing dps or tank, and seem to be super solid in pvp as well. I like the idea of being a tank mainly, since my original character (pally) wouldn’t be so good as a tank in vanilla. Sadly I don’t think I’ll have any friends playing, so leveling may be a bit more of a hassle.
---
Hunter- I’ve always liked hunters, and my second char ever was one. I like being able to solo as much content as possible (my main in retail ended up being a blood dk from the end of wrath up until I stopped playing). In addition to just enjoying soloing, a lot of people say they will be able to make crazy gold per hour, which sounds cool. They sound like they’re not the best at dps though which sucks and of course are limited to being only dps.
---
Orc Rogue is better but, Undead is good enough. It's not like it's gimped or anything. BloodFury, + Stun resist is just too stronk though. The only issue with orc is that as a rogue it looks awful. Undead rogue is the coolest rogue in the game. It's what I would play if I played one.
---
"YOU THERE! CHECK OUT THAT NOISE!"
---
Well shit, my bad. Gonna take another look at that.
---
Yeah I understand, they did what they had to
---
We used to do this back in vanilla quite easily as a priest mage. He would tag a bunch of mobs, then run around using ae while I kept him alive. Great memories of farming the hell out of the hillsbrad fields. It was dangerous, but we were pulling 6-7 guys a few levels below us and destroying them without issue.
---
If we have to do back to something like that (I just become a healbot instead of tank) that's fine, but I'd heard at some point this was a feasible strategy and I'm here to find out if it holds weight. I'm hoping between my high armor and 70% chance to avoid healing knock back that I'll last long enough for him to mostly wear them down, then I can switch to healing him when he gets aggro.
---
Yeah except "differences between WoW classic and Vanilla" should be an entirely different thread. 
---
This is for Beta Bugs/Problems. "Please add bugs below in as much detail as possible. Please be clear and concise. I will form a masterlist here soon."
---
In no way shape or form does this say to list differences between WoW Classic and Vanilla. I'm sorry to say that your statement is just wrong. End of Story.
---
Yes you do that but go holy prot and just use seal of righteousness
---
This is why I'd want classic+ over tbc. If they're going to add content, they should just make the classic experience more complete with more gear options to open up new meta.
---
It does not negate the fact that as a rogue you are trying to kill people in stuns and, Orcs have a 25% base attack buff. Shit is stronk as fuck. That being said I would play Undead because it's still amazing and way cooler.
---
way to make me consider playing druid.  I LOVED druid in WOTLK for it's flexibility but that was when I could dual-spec tank and heals... I was never particularly good at druid in pvp though, and I think they'll only be tougher to play in vanilla in that regard
---
They can just test it on their client.
---
You can always be an officer in the guild. They have responsibilities that can vary depending on how the guild is organized, but you're also a good go-between for the leadership and the rest of the guild. Getting 40 people together who are trustworthy, competent, well prepared, and drama-free is a big ask for any one person. There's plenty of need for support in those areas. You'll just have to play long enough to figure out what's needed for your guild.
---
If you’re going to level together another idea to consider is hunter. Both classes will have early speed buffs so she doesn’t feel like she’s leaving you behind while running around the world. 
---
Hunters are necessary for raiding but not as sought after as other classes. They would level well with a Druid though. They’re also insanely fun to play. Also if you’re going Alliance you’ll have shadowmeld for some fun shenanigans that arise from you both being able to stealth.
---
DM = Deadmines
---
DM West = Dire Maul West
---
DM East = Dire Maul East
---
DM North = Dire Maul North
---
Tribute Run = DM North
---
VC = Victor Charlie = Viet Cong
---
In all fairness, your point is well thought out. It's wrong, but that doesn't make you a bad person.
---
Dude what kind of autism do you have?
---
I'm not going to further entertain this raw display of liberal power. You can use rule 7 as a blanket statement to enforce your liberal agenda of political correctness on me, that's fine. It won't change the context of my post, but in the end you will have only like-minded people around you. Blizzard did the same to WoW over the years and the result is BFA, only the scum of gaming still play that steaming pile.
---
Apply this to society as a whole and what you get is this decadent bowl of shit we call mankind, where people hate each other in their hearts, stab each other on the back, while smiling and being politically correct.
---
Not me, not today.
---
Have a good day friend.
---
And alliance players complain about how Horde has no honor.
---
I was gonna say this too, worst feeling ever and I've done it on too many characters to count
---
assuming you can get in
---
I liked the click for the PvP trinket.
---
I laughed. Fun to see someone using their whole bag of tricks to change someone else's plan.
---
Hi Kinx. I remember you from Argent Dawn, I played a char called Lovasik in Insight guild. If you're looking for a guild for classic let me know, I play with a good bunch of people from private servers and we'll be looking for new members.
---
Feet?  noob!  it's called face rolling for a reasaodnaslb v a,sfv m
---
How does that makes it harder to find the guild on your server in game? You wouldn't even see anyone from other servers
---
I'm done speaking to you, please go back to BFA.
---
Oh so you mean to find one before hand? 
---
My suggestion about finding one in game is pointing to just waiting until it releases and looking through trade/ other chat channels to find a guild you like.
---
Yes, this post is a bit early... just getting things ready. Please have mercy on us mods.
---
I actually think the social aspect is probably the part I can be most helpful with, as it a modest talent of mine. As we tend to be casual I am kinda hoping we can attract people with full time jobs like us, which might help cut down on the drama to a certain extent.
---
Dwarves are the last race of the Alliance I want to kill.
---
Go human and quest through nelf zones
---
In a dev video they discussed the idea of doing it through polling the community like OSRS does so I feel pretty confident and actually excited for it.
---
Are you supposed to equip a quiver? I thought it went on your bag bar instead
---
I think Asmongold is already in
---
A lot of people will still be at work compared to last time so it should be somewhat easier to get in
---
Bugs in a beta with new server architecture? Who would have thought.
---
I'm wondering if frost would even be necessary/optimal if I can hold out as a tank for a while. Would flame strike/ae have more theoretical damage output, assuming he is not getting hit at all? I always assumed the trade off with blizzard was it allowed more control via speed reduction at the cost of dps. But if the speed reduction isn't needed, maybe we could do more damage with other aoe? I can imagine flame strike + consecration doing some sweet ticks if I can hold aggro and stay alive long enough. 
---
And I'll be honest, I'm not so worried about leveling  speed, I'm just here to enjoy the ride and watch big numbers tick all over the place :)
---
I guess I'm a minority, but I love watching Soda. Watched him for years now, yeah he complains (so do others), has a bit of fits (so do others). Though out of the top streamers, he is humble. Always thanking people for the stuff they do, and is trying to improve himself with the game. Glad he's enjoying the game and having fun with it.
---
can you explain the totems you have to bind and why?
---
Preeeeetty sure I'm peaking in my 30s. Last year was the best one of my life and this one is tracking well too! 
---
I wasn't really saying that my time off is worth more, it was more of a tongue in cheek remark about what that persons career must be. Full time student with a part time gig at Jamba Juice? Maybe. Mega rich stock trader living the life of luxury? Certainly possible. Self employed artist / IT professional / whatever? OK. Non-essential employee at a large company or government outlet? Most likely.
---
Don't judge me for judging others for how they choose to spend their free time. You're incredibly transparent and I believe you're talking about yourself.
---
This right here. Just meet up at one of the starting areas and get at it.
---
Just join a guild as a social and attend raids whenever you are availble. The most difficult part about raiding in vanilla is the upkeep of your 40-man roster.
---
Also in the mid phases (I'd guess when BWL is out), the better guilds will divide their groups and form multiple Molten Core runs. Reserving bindings, BoEs and some of the most sought after items. However as a pretty fresh 60 with most of your pre-raid BiS you will still be able to pick up a few decent items and get experience of the raid.
---
Then there will also be 20-mans with ZG/AQ with shorter reset timers and good loot that you can run.
---
Do you think that if populations are really big, the amount of speed runners could affect one another's leveling?
---
What makes warrior leveling so slow? Is it the down time and lack of healing? I forget how professions work but you can take first aid, fishing, and cooking in addition to other professions right? So could you use those professions to reduce the down time through consumables?
---
You forgot the shit bucket lol
---
Found Ragnaros
---
I totally missed that.
---
&lt;Braces for incoming posts asking what is the best talent to take&gt;
---
I remember when they multiplied all damage numbers with 10 in Runescape, it might make balancing better but damn it felt so much better going from hitting 9 to 10, than going from hitting 99 to 100.
---
yeah vanilla was built to be a complete game not just an xpack and it shows
---
Warrior: pve as tank or fury, pvp as arms so yea you would respec here.  Rank 10 gear is quite good for warrior, but not really good enough so you will likely want to pve eventually.  Decked out, best scaling class in game in pvp, 2nd best scaling in pve.  
---
Rogue:  Basically as anti-in demand as possible, so strike here
---
Priest: Shadow is not in demand in pve, but ok in pvp.  Rank 10 gear is designed for shadow so it is ok, but if you are healer you NEED some pve gear to be a good support.  Disc is superior pvp spec, holy superior in pve, but most raids will happily take disc priests as the difference is very minor.  Most recruited class for both pvp and pve typically.  
---
Druid:  Groups only take 1 in pvp, and 2-3 in a 40 man raid, but there are usually not a lot of druids at max level for some reason.  You would need to play both as resto. pvp gear is not for resto, so you need to pve.  Not super recruited, but welcome to most raids.  1 is a requirement in wsg pvp.  So if there are not a lot of druids you will find groups easily.
---
Came out with BC? It’s been so long, damn
---
no kidding.  I'm just saying that's what burns me on the game.  I know it's going to happen.  I'm tempted to no life it for a week and get "ahead of the curve" or just play super casually and not care about hitting 60 in the first 6 months or so.
---
This escalated quickly.
---
Rather a Warlock/Dwarf priest/Paladin if Ally or Resto shaman if horde. They always seem to be in demand.
---
I play both. I just feel that come August I will be playing Classic more than BfA.
---
just dont make him play a dwarf. Peter hates fantasy dwarf
---
Thanks for the detailed response. I appreciate it.
---
For real. Turns out being successful in your field nets benefits. "This just in, Richard Dawkins has priority seating at biology conferences, Biology students furious and, want answers. Tune in at 11 for full report."
---
It took me 7 months to hit 60 on my dwarf hunter. I used to message 60s asking for gold. I was also like 13 or 14 lol
---
Healing is much harder in classic. There's no one button to heal all. 
---
Warlocks were rare (from my experience) in wow. But maybe it was good Warlocks, were hard to find.
---
As for shamens, everyone who played them loves them, and I would always have one in my party, so dynamic and resourceful.
---
Good luck with your choice I think it's going to be a hard one
---
Yeah bugs in a beta lets downvote proof about bugs because we feel attacked for some reason! - this subreddit.
---
Every single spec in the game is perfectly viable for leveling and getting gear prior to 60. If you seriously think the question was in large part concerning leveling, then I'm just at a loss for words.
---

It's normal to not see the realm yet, right? It says no realms available.

It's mainly funny because after leaving WoW after vanilla and a little bit of TBC and Wrath I looked far and wide for that "WoW Killer". Played many MMO's and always left after a relatively short period of time, I did this for at least a decade or longer. It is somewhat amusing to me that WoW itself will likely be the only thing that keeps my even in the genre at all.

Ok???

Do you really need a post to tell people you’re gonna play a different game? 
---
A lot of people play other games more than retail.
---
&gt; Thanks, already knew that
---
then use it.
---
&gt; I didn't, Blizzard did.
---
no, you said "x is not important, what is important now is ..". 
---
&gt; Not sure what you are trying to say here but the journey is plenty difficult as is. Much harder than retail.
---
read it, again and again. and again. i guess the wheels have a slow start but you'll get it in the end. i believe in you.
---
&gt; People used to tank with 2h in Vanilla. If you can find any proof otherwise, I'd love to see it. 
---
[you make an assumption and want me to find proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)? i'm guessing you were hit in the head and never recovered. probably 90% of videos from vanilla are showing tanks with shields. its not even funny how retarded this paragraph is.
---
&gt; As in anything that they aren't maxed out for. It's like freaking out that someone is having an easy time in Scholo when they are full tier 1 vs running it in pre blue set. It's a skewed situation from the start.
---
i guess reading is a challenge for you. maybe posting again will help: "btw the guy tanking in the clip has been tanking from DM up to SM with a 2h. you can find the vods in the link provided. *so he did it even before having "THE BEST GEAR IN THE GAME!!!!!!111one*"
---
&gt; It's not bullshit, it's accurate to 1.12.
---
it is absolute bulshit since there is no 1.12 official patch notes and have mark kern on tape saying that blizzard lost the data and recovered some from nostalrius team. which links up to the fact that they have no official patch notes for vanilla and tbc on site. but hey, how about we ignore that since it can be actual evidence as opposed to "blizzard said so, it must be true". let me share a secret with you besides the fact that you're a pretentious idiot with no grasp of how a silogism or burden of proof actually works: yes, companies do lie when it suits them. they manipulate markets, audiences and bent rules. shocking, i know :). like when [blizzard deleted bug reports from bfa beta that they couldn't/wont fix](https://twitter.com/asmongold/status/1052670067807281152?lang=en). [or when they repost videos on youtube to hide the negative replies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/9tnrlb/blizzard_is_removing_comments_on_the_diablo/). [or when they ban entire guilds because their own staff made a mistake](https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/29/player-receives-developer-item-in-the-mail-one-shots-ulduar/). mad conspiracies, i know :)
---
&gt; Good job saying nothing. If you don't like 1.12, don't play Classic. It's that simple
---
good job congratulating yourself. that's an exact copy from your unsubstantiated crap. you don't like your own shit? ironic. so, once more, if you don't like my writing, stop reading it. it's that simple.
---
&gt; I don't know what you mean. Where did who learn what? And even then, the numbers are correct. Not based on pserver data, based on actual 1.12.
---
yes, elusive 1.12 that has no backup besides "blizzard said so". also, conveniently enough, with no official patch notes.
---
&gt; People used to do that in Vanilla. There are a few bosses, like the Elemental in WC that actually required a shield. People forgetting after 15 years and knowing more about how the game works is going to make it seems easier.
---
sure they did, youtube and warcraftmovies is full of clips with players 2h tanking from deadmines up to lich king. oh wait, those are dks. and they're from wrath onward. however, once again, [here's how to hyperlink](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile/comments/8d1v2r/how_to_hyperlink/) since you seem to forget. dont be shy, share the videos(yes plural) that can back up your assertions.
---
&gt; None of your 'arguments' have any validity.
---
none of YOUR 'arguments' have any validity. see? it's easy. also stupid since you need to back that up and all you can provide is "no, you!" attitude

&gt; Blizzard chose 1.12, that's what's being used, no matter how much you whinge

24, Had been playing Warcraft since Orcs &amp; Humans and was an avid Warcraft 3 player, so my hopes where high. It did not disappoint. Had a lot of fun with friends while it lasted, and quit mid-WotlK due to work and the (I believe?) introduction of the dungeon finder. I did return for a few weeks or so during WoD, but found the game shallow.

Agreed man it’s super important. From the resources I’ve looked at with no direct experience: farming solo is decent as a 30/0/21 ele resto build in that you can 1v1 while also having no real need to respec. That last bit alone means a lot less gold spent each week. Anyone able to offer some advice on farming as a sham would be helpful though... might need friends.
---
4k to 5k is fine
---
473,854,315 to 736,549,208 is not lol
---
I was trash-talking my friends for beeing hyped for classic and playing on private servers. Now I am more hyped (if possible) than them.
---
Not afk. I just cut the first half of de video. Thanks for your feedback.
---
You can't hold aggro, he will pull off of you, you will die, or you'll have to stick to just a couple mobs at a time. Any kind of large pack aoe grinding will 100% require frost, there's just too much damage, and you'll have too much spell pushback to heal yourself. If you just want to dick around with pulling a couple mobs, go ahead, but you don't need to and shouldn't bother building around that... it's not like you are min-maxing.
---
If you want to see big numbers ticking all over the place, don't play a paladin.
---
It was not considered grieving in vanilla I would highly disappointed if they made that stance on classic. Same goes with camping and PvP. On retail you can be reported for ruining someone’s play experience for camping them, but there was no such hand holding in vanilla.
---
no worries mate, tbh its not exactly widely known yet. we sure as shit didnt know about that in original vanilla(former world first warr fwiw)  
---
but ya warrs get 80% of spirit +6 (nerfed to 50% +6 in tbc)  
---
and for stacking it, as i mentioned in my first post, spirit is almost free in many cases. Things like a 7str/6sta/6spirit when a same level 'of the bear' might only be a 7str/7sta. around half the gear your wearing can/will end up like that.  
---
recently leveled 2 warrs to 45 and 46 and i didnt even carry food(i had some sta/sprit buff food but generally used that prefights)  
---
Of course, you will still bandage quite often but bandages are plentiful as hell and real quick.
---
Hey all!  
---
So I was thinking of doing RSham, but now I'm debating to do either RDruid or HPriest. Enjoy casual PvP/PvE, don't mind on being the best but enjoy being a bit of utility to the ground (Hence why RSham). Been watching streamers, seems like Druids FC. Barely see HPriests and Rshams.

Coming from you calling a stranger an 'insufferable jackass'
---
Sure, but that's not the kind of speedrunning I meant.
---
Sub 1-minute Rag and Ony kills.
---
15 second Vael kills.
---
20 minute MC clears.
---
Etc.
---
There's a bug megathread, or, better yet, since this sub has no way to fix beta bugs, you can report them to blizzard through the beta. Opening up another thread about it is pointless.
---
In actual Vanilla, I only went on one raid.  Molten core, rad wiped not very far into it, after the second wipe they called it.
---
It wasn't until burning crusade that I  raided again.
---
I don't believe that's what I did, though.
---
I obviously enjoy this game (and several others) a lot. I don't think enjoying games is wrong, I think letting a game monopolize your life is. I never said OP was guilty of doing that, either. I only speculated that he may be, there's a difference.
---
they just want to be a part of some tribe I guess. must be lonely ppl
---
Good. That’s what I think we are all hoping for, just checking, I though I remembered them saying safe faction grieving was bannable
---
I’m just calling you stupid. Cause you are.
---
Stun resist is still awesome. Orc hunters are also in the same boat as you, neither of you benefit from Blood Fury, however you get command, and that's a passive damage boost that doesn't cause you to piss off the healers.
---
It's the exact same thing they did last week. The initial two hours is where they monitor the strain on the servers and let everyone log in at once
---
No its "Layering is fine guys don't worry Pt. 2", which is obviously sarcasm. And as u can see, layering is not fine, its not even working as intended. Whats the problem with the title?
---
It's so sad how few people practice this- even in PVP servers.
---
Pallies are nice to test your spells and rotation on because they can only run away and heal. Can't wait to hunt these fuckers down.
---
Damn dude that's a gamechanger for when I'll be leveling come Classic. Thanks a bunch for the tip!
---
How will you be using enchanting to make gold? Not sarcastic, looking for advice!
---
Why did you have to say this.
---
Why
---
This is the big reason for me. I never got further than a few bosses into most raids, and never even saw the inside of BWL until I farmed it for transmog gear in WoD. I'm really looking forwards to actually trying them.
---
Let them have trolls. Big goofy dumb clown feet. GET SHOES LOSER!
---
How to report bugs "Joining groups on the same layer causes people to switch layer" NOT sarcasm l o l.
---
Yes and literally anything else you can think of
---
Holy paladins are important though.
---
It means that they’re gonna temporarily shut down the main beta servers and force everyone with beta/stress access to log on into one single server during the two hour time period.
---
After that period is up, those with beta access will be able to log back on the main servers while those with only stress test access are only granted access to the stress test server (which means lvl 10 cap)
---
Edit: wanna add that the stress test server will only be up for about 24-26 hours, so get your fill
---
You can meet up anytime.
---
Horde naturally meets up in barrens (undead show up a bit late and play catch up, skipping a grey quest or two).
---
Night elf can go a long time without heading to loch modan/Westfall. NE has to make an effort. 
---
Humans dwarves and gnomes can sync up at loch modan it Westfall and it’s easy with the team.
---
Isn't access tied directly to an account? That means someone would have to give you their account info. Unlikely to happen.
---
Well then Warlock would be equally as good or even better. Just slap on the bloodvine set and you're pretty much ready for raiding.
---
Mining gives the gold, enchanting on the long way after getting some recipes, that should be the point for droping mining and 1-300 eng.
---
I may fail but im planning on that, playing hunter and expecting to be on the first places reaching 60 so i should be able to farm well for a bit, it wouldnt be my first “realm first” as hunter but never on classic tho so lets see
---
There was a post on here a few days ago - some guy saying that sort of attitude is 'cancerous' and leads to griefing.
---
Damn straight it leads to griefing, why do you think my level 60 is camped out in Stranglethorn? To dance and wave at you?
---
This just in: taking time off = allowing something to monopolize your life.
---
Oh i don't want to play it, it was just nice to say hello to him. He's on an account I abandoned a decade ago.
---
Thanks for brining this up!
---
Everytime I watch a WSG with both horde and alliance point of view they do not see eachother until they are about in the middle then they render/phase in
---
In vanilla you could see them on the opposite base from the opposite base
---
thats my catch phrase for anyone who wonders why Im going back to classic 
---
"going to class trainers sucks"
---
-yeah but it makes sense from an RPG standpoint, and it makes gold really matter when leveling, making me think about profession choices (which also matter) and makes me consider do I power level? or do I work on my professions to make some gold?
---
thats just one tiny little example of how a small annoyance makes the game better due to a chain reaction of RPG decisions
---
&gt; Orc hunters are also in the same boat as you, neither of you benefit from Blood Fury
---
say hello to Raptor Strike!
---
Or "Should I..."
---
From what I've seen max graphics looks pretty good.
---
That’s a couple of phases in no?
---
Would trade Trolls for Dwarves any day. If the horde was Undead, Orcs, Tauren and, Dwarves. This war would have ended long ago. Damn half men are carrying their team and, everyone knows it.
---
Very slow start in 2005, took months to get to 60 after quite a few re-rolls. Crowning achievement would be to be the offtank during AQ40 progression, killing twin-emps 1 time after many many wipes and never being able to kill them again. I remember our closest attempt thereafter being 1% before one of our hunter's auto-shots followed them through the teleport exchange causing instant aggro and wiping us. I believe that's when I decided to chill out until TBC :).
---
I feel like I bumbled my way through most of this experience but it was such a blast and I can't wait to do it again.
---
I try extremely hard to provid for lowbies as much as possible. I pass out bags, give random heals/buffs, and give free enchants.
---
Fire mage is a meme spec now? I never played private servers so maybe thats the "meta" there but during vanilla I saw more fire mages than anything else. If anything arcane would be a meme spec, people just got 21 for pom but I can't remember anyone going full arcane.
---
The lore actually explains why the skin color of orcs is the way it is and could be helpful making a decision. They were a brownish color in Draenor then over time they became corrupted by fell magic and began turning green. I'm making a warlock so I'm going to be as green as possible. Back before the corruption they lived a shamanistic lifestyle so making a brownish shaman would make a lot of sense.
---
Just curious but what is the strategy for recruiting 40 people before the game launches to commit to this? Isn't it difficult to find that many people that can take off work, not sleep, and ignore miscellaneous responsibilities?
---
Honestly I would try it if I could, but I'm just genuinely curious otherwise.
---
Yes, but they are too hard to find in the crowd of ret fanboys
---
Well earthbind and grounding totem are essential for PvP. A slow and a spell absorb speak for themselves.
---
Then there are searing totem for long battles, and fire nova totem to help burst.
---
Then are a bunch of stat boosting totems like grace of air/strength of earth/mana tide etc. these aren't always worth the mana, as your opponent can just fight away from them, but if you sense an all in, they can be nice.
---
And of course windfury totem to give the wf buff to melee classes close to you.
---
Biggest thing atleast in dueling is that almost all classes aside from hunters try to deadzone warriors so id say youd find the deadzone mitigation of a tauren more frequently than stun resist. Plus the deadzone mitigation is 100% uptime whereas the resist is just a percentage
---
iirc, the wow community at the time of 1.12 also thought leveling was made significantly easier, but with it being so close to TBC and the nee level cap on the horizon, most players didnt experience it and/or cared.
---
It's not hard to understand, it's that their way of having fun is forced on all the people who don't want to play the game that way. So it's in the casuals face all the time.
---
For the record I am a min/maxer but I can understand the appeal of casual.
---
Yea they were more like communities/discords now, but still not quite, maybe a curated collection of friend's lists is the closest you can get.
---
Hey man, I remember your paladin nick at least :)
---
I found a few others. This one I'm especially fond of, as its from a community called Happy Funtime Crew. We were a bunch of people who hit level 60, but didn't have enough guildmembers to play the later dungeons with.
---

---
The comment about disenchanting an epic made me laugh, and the group chat of how the healer had fun.
---
Honestly this is why I wanted private servers to just stay the way they were, and not have classic. But here we are classic is releasing, so naturally I have to play it now &gt;.&lt;
---
Nice. I always had a decent gaming computer so even back in 2004-5 I never had issues in raiding. Only time things came to a crawl were some World PvP battles.... that often times crashed the server itself.
---
Stun resist is life for warlocks. Jesus christ if they got a spell power boost too. Mages can kill themselves.
---
Respec prices are going to get really high as people test which talents they should use.

He’s a wow celebrity at this point.  He says mean stuff and does shitty stuff to people on a public level.  I didn’t personally attack someone on this thread.

[When mounts were incredible rare.](http://www.snah.no/wow/mount.jpg)
---
Some games can do it. Dark age of camelot released several pve content expansions, but most of that was new areas to level in (that didnt make the old zones irrelevant until the 3rd or 4th expansion, but they were already declining by then due to WoW killing every other MMO out there). Some gear was better than the old, but most of it was really just sidegrades.
---
I highly recommend trying it on a private server if anyone is interested in an old school, large-scale (AV is tiny compared to Daoc fights) pvp. The pve content is slow but quite alright as well.
---
But are you one of the people who are saying that Blizzard is lying and you "remember" it being harder and this is easy mode?  You don't sound like it, which was my point is that there are a lot of no changes people saying that Blizz is lying about their values, so my counter was if they weren't so against change we might have gotten an actual balanced wow that had all the challenge of vanilla without the extra cruft.
---
Thought it was boob pics. But still, it's a good wallpaper
---
Female orc rogue doesn't look too bad though.
---
They're quite a doozy.
---
More attention we bring to a massive problem, the better.
---
I don't believe I said that, either. You're arguing in bad faith, cannot understand nuance, or are objectively obtuse.
---
I agree that when a smart ass is trying to run the dungeon it's not as enjoyable. Absolutely don't want to feel like a robot having someone dictate then entirety of the dungeon to me. As well I don't like to do that when I lead.
---
Having said that, it's also equally as frustrating and unfun when you wipe 4-5 times on an encounter that should have been 1-2 wipes. If the person causing the problem doesn't bother to read chat, or implement the fix the the issue, they're wasting the other party members time. 
---
It's a two edged sword. There needs to be the fun and excitement of learning things anew, but also the responsibility to be a good party member and know your role, and to be able to pay attention to basic mechanics.
---
When I search yt for classic wow, that guy keeps popping up. 
---
He has a super annoying soy smile face.
---
Lol you're joking right? Blizz hands you an item at the start of the expansion, forces you to use it 100% throughout the expansion, and it's a unique and interesting item?
---
Warriors are melee kings already. Anyone who would be helped by being able to attack you in melee range will wish they weren’t in melee range. Rogues get fucked by Warriors anyway.

Druid res is only a disadvantage if you or your group is bad. There is never a reason to die in a 5 man that couldn’t have been prevented with better decision making.

It does suck in raids where wiping is assumed but there’s 40 people, pretty unlikely all your healers are druids.

---
Is this really a problem? The view distance in vanilla was mostly likely there due to hardware limitations. It’s not 2005 anymore. I don’t see the view distance being a big deal.
---
Please, this is a small closed beta for testing purpose, not an early access for god sake.
---
Leave this kind of pre order cash grab for EA, i don't want to see Blizzard adopt this kind of marketing ...

Some absolute gold in that chat.

It looks good, I don't disagree, but I'd love to see a texture pack that makes it even better. I don't know how huge of a project it would be, but my body is ready. I'd like to see more detailed textures, but otherwise the same rigid objects and color already there. I'd also love to see way more foliage, see those details much farther out, and better environment detail. It'd be epic AF.

What's also great, is any Mods that are put in, will rarely have to be changed or updated. Love it.

You are just salty that paladins &gt; shamans.
---
Yeah, never claimed they are optimal either. Just fun to see how people figured out how to make em work on fights where tank swaps are not required.
---
Other warriors exist man...
---
Ran countless emp runs on my warrior back in the day, not one HoJ dropped. My friend always taunted me because he had  6 level 60s and each one had a HoJ.... even the clothies. 😠
---
My life for vanilla

You can see them they can see you

Kind of upset it’s so early. I want to do my part and spam logins while pservering, but won’t be home for the first 1.5 hours

A true veteran from classic would never be mean to someone who is a noob
---
Lol all of these stories are great, but this one is maybe the best
---
Search classic wow -asmongold you are welcome

2004 account, on and off sub. Got beta wave 2. Havent paid in money since Oct.. all of my subs have been wow gold.
---
Ugh. 12th of august. Was hoping to have the info earlier to decide which realm to choose with friends and coworkers.
---
Thanks for the quick reply!
---
stress test WSG anyone?
---
Yes. It was a bad idea.
---
No clue.  I charged many people in vanilla and beyond, but never saw it anyone hurdle me.  Not sure if this is happening on beta.
---
I havent played wow much at all. Max char was 90 or smth in Legion(?).
---
Looking forward to a hard RPG game. And noone will be able to stop me having fun :D
---
Thanks for the Hunter tip with the ledge btw. How can i prevent this? Sending pet away and recasting it?
---
I believe I remember reading a thread that "jumping" various abilities such as charge or frost nova was not possible in the beta.
---
lmao. Indeed. First time around for me I was lucky to get 15fps on medium settings. if it wasn't CPu/GPU lag screwing up my rotation, it was Network lag. It's gonna be wild man.
---
I'm hopeful this will not be the case. I didn't experience anywhere near the level of rudeness some folks here are expressing during vanilla.
---
The only time I ran into toxicity was after your personal reputation no longer mattered (Cross Realm Dungeon Finder). It was like when that thing hit, over night, the vitriol and crap attitudes came out of the woodwork. 
---
One of my favorite things about MMOs is the communities, and helping other players out. I get enjoyment out of helping others, in part because I just like helping people, and in part because of how pivotal others helping me was when I first started out in MMOs.
---
I'll do my part to continue that tradition wherever and whenever I can.
---
One of the most important one is the one on the horde tunnel hut (the lowest piece of lumber above the entrance to get rid of people chasing on the hut, LoS on the hut and jumping up and down from it quickly), alliance and horde GY jumps need to be second nature, the one on the huge construct next to horde berserking hut. Those are more important than others but the midfield ones still matter somewhat.
---
lol?
---
Do it. Autoattack with consecrate, and every 30 seconds you can trade half your mana for 10% of an enemy's health.
---
Level 10 meta is where it's at.
---
OP was probably 14 yo and just wanted to make one of those cool pvp videos. Now OP is just showing off the stuff they found from back in the day, the same as half the current posts are doing. I dont think OP intended to impress us with their 15 year old epic druid pvp video.
---
I keep hearing about how great warlocks are but also how rare they are and probably will be still fairly uncommon. I dont really get it though, why would they be rare if they are so good? It cant all be the soul shard farming issue could it?
---
I main paladin
---
It was cool to see prepatch Druid, thanks for the upload.  What language is that, German?
---
You sound like a PVPer. I would choose Shadow. Warriors are going to be a dime a dozen. No one wants warrior number 5 for thier premade WSG groups, but people always love a S Priest.

I hope so man... Haven't seen a single drop of rain or snowflake in the Beta yet.

Do you have to respec full resto every time you raid? Isn't that kinda nuts?

No. And I didnt

Woo.. day after launch.
---
Well, the man is in a lot of asmongolds streams. I dont watch them but it could be substantiated.
---
From the few clips i *have* seen, he doesnt come off as super likeable. But then again, neither does asmongold.
---
Hey I've made bank off of a few items.

I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

When holding down mouse2 and moving camera sometimes swings into the sky, only with high polling rate on mouse
---
There are some gear combos that make Orc look awesome though. Just very hard to accomplish.
---
Basically the camp I fall into.
---
Yes I'm (kinda) considering hunter also. I just hate mana being a constraint in PvP as a hunter who already is somewhat underpowered versus casters.
---
&gt; playing for 3 months leading up to it would burn you out quicker.  
---
*Looks at retail paladin that has 307 days /played on him alone*  
---
Nope nope I don't think there's a risk of that.
---
I think he means the number is so big, he doesn’t know what’s it’s called. Like whatever’s after trillion.
---
Would that I could innervate you all the way to 60!
---
There's a boar one too.
---
15 will be a pain as people still wear white gear, some slots they wear nothing and attacks will mostly dodge, parry and miss.
---
The difference between vanilla/tbc/wotlk and today, is that in the old times the world was a world. There were people everywhere and the need for others for elite quests and world pvp. This is gone today. But  the pro is that today you don't suffer of all those kind of injustices that comes from the need of others and the cooperation which can reach the level of mafia in vanilla. Expect a lot of ganking if you play on a pvp server, and a lot of injustice in raids. One example? Do you think that people will build guilds to gear you up? This is not going to happen unless you are really lucky. You need 40 people devoted to the game to do progress. You are just the one that will allow those bastards people to get their gear and then move into a better guild, this happens a lot in vanilla. And not only this. Pvp system is just ridicolous for example and mafia will dominate it. You call this social? well ok. Then it is more social.
---
Who knows? People take this stuff seriously.
---
Lol it's all good we're all just having fun here.  I wasn't being serious.
---
Cdew just experienced layering when invited to a group to kill a quest mob, the mob despawned.
---
In Warsong gulch you cannot see enemy players until they are about 20-30 yards in front of you 
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ArbitraryCourteousLatteTheRinger
---
Back in Vanilla you could see from base to base. I'm guessing retail view distance is in place.
---
Not hectic at all. Much slower, more of a management game. Fewer mechanics to worry about, less raidwide spike damage. Less fire to stand in. 
---
You'll have an assignment... you won't be responsible for raid healing everyone. 
---
You will probably have to unlearn the retail practice of ABC. You will spam plenty of downranks but there will be times where it makes more sense to just sit there and regen.
---
You will need some different information than you need in retail, especially if you play druid and your guild brings more than one. There's other information you will not need.
---
yeah I think scaleing is fine for retail
---
but im looking forward to there being legit high and low level zones again, I like earning my way to a new hub and having conquered the old zone/hub
---
Palidans played correctly essentially don't have any mana issues.
---
Please use the doll and show us where did the big bad Paladin touched you .
---
Yea, it makes more sense for retail WoW than it does for classic. Wouldn’t really make too much sense in classic wow. In retail wow you still can go back to the zones at max level and destroy everything though.
---
Ouch.
---
&gt;  best race for pve, due to blood fury

Your healers will love you :D

The sign of a good player right here boys.

---
t0 pally looking so nice they had to remodel it so warriors wouldnt ninja
---
What exactly did resilience do and/or break?
---
Well, think outside your own little dome. Last test was 2 am to 4 am on a work night for us in the EU. This is still late for us - 11 pm to 1 am, but it'd doable. Doubt it'll have much impact on amount of players :p
---
Quadrillion. Quad means 4. But then I'd definitely have to check after that. Septillion?
---
They should have kept it baked into intellect and agility from the start. We would have never needed crit rating.
---
We have over 100 people that claim they can get to 60 before Sept 2nd. They filled out an extensive application and went through an interview process. Not having young children or work commitments during that week were priorities.
---
A team of about 20 will be sacrificing their own character's progress to ensure we have tanks and healers.
---
But most importantly, we've been practicing. Squeezing out every hour of our leveling grind, raiding MC and Ony in greens, porting over addons we think we'll need, figuring out how to abuse layering on the Beta, etc.
---
In 3 months, the number of players will go down, not everyone is cut out for it, they just like the idea of being in the guild with a week 1 Rag kill. But we'll have more than enough people really dedicated and working together perfectly to field at least one raid team before Tuesday's reset.
---
We have a dry run planned for late July. 0 to 60 and a full MC clear in less than a week is the goal. After that, we'll stop training to rest up and prepare for the real deal.
---
Mr. T had a string of commercials and an in game NPC.
---
Maybe I didnt explain it well enough.  I don't mean they jump over the warrior haha.
---
[Here is an example](https://youtu.be/XDHd0oQeeFU?t=548)
---
Good call
---
You are only restricted on primary professions, I'd recommend skinning/tailoring as your primary professions leveling up, you can eventually pick up mining on an alt and drop skinning for engineering down the road. 
---
First Aid, Cooking, and Fishing are all secondary professions so I can level them all up as your level as well.
---
Paladin is THE class for doing big AoE pulls in low level dungeons.
---
Yeah that's fine too; it wasn't stated by DagonPie that there should be this option. In modern WoW there is no option.
---
I'd say drop the first aid and take tailor the shadoweave set is pretty amazing for you when you can start making it
---
Some place where the holy light don't shine
---
Extremely triggered by meme OMEGALUL go run lfr maybe it’ll calm your tendies
---
Yup, that was it!
---
1/3/2007. started playing last 2 weeks of vanilla basically lol
---
Didn't realize that's what was happening with frost nova too.
---
The good part about classic is that you actually learn to play the game by leveling. Just run every dungeon as you level. You'll be fine.
---
You originally mentioned adderall specifically. I was telling you that trying to get a specific prescription might not be as easy as some people think. 
---
&gt;Do they work as good as stims tho?
---
Depends on what symptom you are trying to treat. ADHD symptoms? In some people, yes. Stay up all night gaming? No, they will not.
---
don't worry, if they delay it long enough it'll become blizzlike again
---
So, to clarify, all 3 Warlock specs I mentioned are inferior talent setups to an Enhancement Shaman?
---
Same. It’s a reward in itself when you unlock the 3-5 quest in the next big hub. It’s like the game sees that your worthy of taking on the next set of tasks vs going to a hub and getting access to all quest no matter the level.
---
This is big. What class, what tree, and which talent will it be?!
---
How good (or bad) is PVP elem in dungeon blues and T1 / T2 raid level ?
---
So triggered. 
---
I hope I see 100 more “classic will kill bfa”.  It’s been over a decade that people have said wow is dying. Wouldn’t want it to change.
---
I was just listening while working. Then I come here and here you are again. I’m enjoying the podcast. I like the positivity about classic. I miss the old days of the game and look forward to reliving them.
---
I mean that's extremely disingenuous, the only reason that's the case is because you're not raiding at an even remotely close to cutting edge level. For reference I was a 45 neck over 3 months ago. For anyone mythic raiding you would've been so far behind your alt wouldn't have been relevant.
---
Neck level 40 was considered baseline for guilds going into battle for dazaralor mythic for alts (4 months ago). That meant grinding a LOT of island expeditions to keep up. Of course if you're raiding casually you're not going to need anywhere near that but the neck grind for alts is insane compared to any vanilla grind. "nothing is grindy about BFA right now." Is some serious bullshit.
---
TBC 100% trivialized all vanilla content.
---
Are you fucking serious? Lol that might be some of the most ignorant shit I've read all week.
---
Allakazham, Thottbot, and Wowhead are all part of the same network, Fanbyte, previously known as the ZAM network. Kind of hard to "steal" something when you **literally own it**. I mean, you don't think it's sheer coincidence that http://www.thottbot.com/ redirects to https://classic.wowhead.com/ do you?
---
So mad.
---
I find it funny that even a thread specifically asking for what you'll miss you get downvoted. That said I really love in vanilla when you see a dude on the opposite faction and he's got T2 you don't fuck with him. You can tell at a glance how powerful someone is.
---
I feel like the tauren could have fit in as alliance
---
were it not for the events of WC3 of course
---
This is the intended function of layering, and it fucking sucks.
---
Hmm maybe, that would definitely be no beuno, if the second swing is using a proc from the first swing can the second swing proc windfury again? Weird.. still the whole point is burst damage, having to wait 3 seconds to get the full benefit can be life or death in pvp
---
It's fine dude. You can continue to live in the egotistical bubble you were born in and everyone else will just agree to live life the way they enjoy most.
---
Black n white is alright
---
Is there anyone that actually says the current implementation of layering is bug free and perfect?
---
It's funny because I always see these posts arguing with an imaginary group of people...
---
I wouldn't know, I haven't raided.
---
I hear some people get away with raiding 30-0-21, which is the best Ele spec, as you'll still have ok heals.
---
i mean its not even a meme at this point bfa is fucking abysmal
---
How does mob tagging with in retail with regards to drops?
---
YES! Always, if you see a rando doing the same mobs, and you send em an invite, they basically always accept! I met my guild this way, and have made several PVE friends like this. 
---
Heck yeah, we even toss /waves at each other.
---
The economy is hard to say. Greed isnt much of a factor because the beta is just a beta, it is also capped at 30. No one is trying to sell AH stuff for mount money, ect
---
yes? But mostly just levelers. See comment about the economy. 
---
Constantly! Pugging happens. G Chat is booming, every one is very excitedly sharing old timey stories.  You can /1 and have pleasant (or shitlord barrens chats) conversations while auto attacking your way to pally glory. 
---
PVP is about 2x as many horde, PVE is about equal.
---
I think a *lot* of people got to sixty, ran Strat and Scholo a few times, and then goofed around or started an alt, especially on poorly progressed servers.
---
On servers where MC and ZG pugs were commonplace I imagine over 1% saw a raid boss fall over, but on my crappy failserver I wouldn't be at all surprised if less than 1% did.
---
oh suddenly there is an argument eh? now that is rofl    
---
&gt;This is irrelevant to WoW as the games are fundamentally different  
---
The OP of this chain implied that WoW(pvp) vanilla is rock&gt;scissors. Way to miss the point I guess?  
---
&gt;Balance is them being all equal, as can been seen in Retail  
---
No, that is one way of balancing the game. And there are many things to be equal at, so there will be inequalities in other areas.  
---
Perfect equality cannot be achieved, thus many different ways to balance, like utility.  
---
&gt;If your class has a spec for tank/heal/dps then you can do well at any of those rolls. This is not true in Classic/Vanilla.  
---
Yea because blizzard's shit "balancing" and dev's warrior favoritism.  
---
&gt;Also, Warlocks are not 'top damage'. They are the lowest DPS class in the game, except maybe hunters  
---
Maybe on your shitty private server. 
---
&gt;I know this is probably going to be a tough one for you to comprehend but... this is what's known as a subjective matter.  
---
Lmao what? How can that be subjective? You are literally battling against shitty AI for 99% of your leveling, 100% of dungeons and raids. Just because you can do some PVP inbetween doesn't mean those are not PVE activities.   
---
&gt;Everything you do is to get more gear to be better and the only way you can show it off is to either do the next raid... or PvP. It's half the game  
---
It cannot be half the game when there is no content equal to that. It can be a whole game to someone, and none to other. But content wise its one tenth, if even that. If it was such a huge part of the game, there would be more content for it. But there isn't.  
---
Even today you have like 20 battlegrounds + 20 arenas vs hundreds of dungeons and hundreds of raids. And those bgs and arenas are mostly just terrain, no scripting required. So even the amount of work put into PVP is less than that tenth.  
---
&gt;You only say server type is irrelevant because you know it's counter to your point  
---
No. It doesn't. Warcraft was always about faction warfare. Its completely normal to have PVP servers as a base. That doesn't mean its half the game. They wanted players to WPVP because its more stuff to do.  
---
&gt;The game was originally going to be PvP servers only. All of the leveling/questing, getting to dungeons and raids, using the gear you get from them, and the classes were built around the idea of PvPing.  
---
They were definitely not built around the idea of PVP when the whole game revolves around PVE. They were built in mind that PVP will exist, but thats the extent of it.   
---
&gt;And the only reason to PvE is to get better gear for PvP.  
---
That is just very ignorant and arrogant to say. Nowhere near do people play PVP as much as they play PVP. If people PVPed more, blizzard would offer way more PVP content.   
---
So you're just wrong on that. It might be the case for you, but you're minority.   
---
Its a PVE game. Go play some FPS or MOBAs if you want PVP game.  
---
&gt;Except they aren't. Battlemasters are in main cities. Which was the entire point of them. Making so you don't have to run out to BG entrances to queue. You don't even know wtf you are talking about.  
---
-Run to portal to Q for game  
---
-Run to battlemaster to Q for game  
---
same thing, you're just too much of a dum dum to comprehend. Just because 1 of them is located in more accessable area doesn't mean they are not the same thing.  
---
&gt;This doesn't make any sense. Why would 1 person in your party run all the way to the BG entrance if they can just queue in the city? You have no idea what you are even talking about.  
---
Reading comprehension my dude. Try reading again. I was talking about BG masters, which are the same thing as portals anyway.  
---
(now you go on to talk about how BGportals/masters work even tho you have zero correlation or reading comprehension skills, lmao)  
---
&gt;It's called not caring about what some troll thinks. I'll admit, I fell for it and responded, but I'm done with this one 
---
This is akin to calling someone name and ignoring them. You are one giant puss if you mainly play PVP let me tell you that.  
---
A sore loser that cannot accept defeat.  
---
Truly sad.  
---
No need to reply, we both know you're just wrong :)
---
I never hit 60. My warrior got to 56 or 55, can’t remember.
---
Still had tons of fun.
---
Goldfarming professios like herbalism mining and skinning is usually used by warriors as secondary, but for a tank you could go blacksmithing and rely solely on things like dungeon runs or perhaps fishing for gold. 
---
As for prot in pvp, it's pretty shit but maybe you can make it work. In warsong you would be flag carry and while tanks are tanky, they are very immobile. The problem with tanks in pvp in vanilla is that they don't actually have much hp, it's mostly just +defense and armor, so as a prot tank you will be quite squishy versus caster heavy comps. In AV you will be amazing though, people love having a good pve tank on offense to tank the mobs.
---
The horde video does a much better job of showing it. Distance does seem small but do we have a good vanilla comparison vid?
---
I dont claim to be an expert or even really understand fully how this works, but I'll do my best. Someone plz correct me if in wrong.
---
So, normally, if you are sitting, the enemy auto crits you.  On private servers, you could use this to force an ability that procs when you are crit. In vanilla, forcing a crit by sitting did not proc these abilities (which is why this is addressed on the not-a-bug list).  What this testing has discovered, though, is that if you time it such that you stand up at the same time as you get hit then 1) you force a crit because the game thinks you are sitting and 2) you bypass the "this crit doesnt count cause I am sitting" logic for crit procs because the game thinks that you are standing.  Aka you are sitting and standing at the same time. 
---
Basically, if this is working properly (which we will have to wait for blizzard to confirm), then, as long as you are being hit, we now have a reliable (assuming you are good enough to pull it off) way of forcing crit procced abilities. 
---
Personally I hope that this isnt a bug because then it offers some really cool potential for high skill ceiling play both for pve and pvp.
---
I didnt play wod launch. All i know is that i *really* like the idea of recognizing peoples names, creating friends and enemies, like ive done on private servers. That was one of the most rewarding things from the pserver experience.
---
With layering, there is no way to guarantee i have the same home layer as my friends. We might not share the same world when we're not grouped, which means we cant share the same world or the friends and enemies that inhabit it unless we play literally *every minute* together.
---
Thats really off-putting to me and i wish blizzard would come up with a solution that didnt compromise such a core part of the experience. Is that really so wrong?
---
`classic wow -"Anyone else"`
---
Put that as the search criteria.
---
Rogues are great. I mained one all through Vanilla, play one extensively on a couple Pservers, and have been wrecking face as Rogue in the Beta.
---
I wouldn't go Alliance though. Stun lock is your bread and butter and having nearly 1 out of 3 stuns resisted fucks you up.
---
No class in the game can raid and PvP at maximum efficiency in the same spec.
---
You *can* raid in 30/0/21 but you miss out on some stuff of course.
---
This is definitely the best solution. I like to see the posts, but rarely check the video unless it really grabs my attention.
---
I love doing every quest in the barrens and just feeling like I cleared the biggest zone in the game and then having options on where to go next, small bad ass feelings lol
---
Brace yourself mods, entitled moaning fuckwits who have 0 idea what a Stress test are coming...
---
Tinfoil hat theory: If they released it at the start of summer, kids and college students will no-life most of the content and be burnt out, reducing the likelihood of people subbing for longer which reduces profit. If they release it during school, people will be more incentivized to hold on to their subs longer and increase their desire to play overall because of their limited hours.
---
You probably won't be making too much money for the first couple of months with gathering professions. You'll want to grab mining with engineering to level it.
---
Can't wait to fight alongside you, too. Or destroy you if you're Alliance. Either way, I'm glad your seeing so much positivity.
---
Ok, but OP specifically mentioned after the stat squish (which is bfa retail). Numbers are nowhere near that.
---
I'd strangle your friends too ! :D
---
I'd assume pentillion, then sextillion and septillion
---
Sounds a lot like what retail players said about classic and look where we are now
---
We need to crunch the numbers for the level 10 meta!
---
And that's exactly what they *should* do, why live any other way?
---
Just zoom camera into the ground
---
When do they become profitable?
---
Which is the best?
---
Absolutely. Gnomes first, then male elves and humans.
---
First aid is secondary no need to drop it
---
Some people just wanna be mad about something. This is a feature that won’t even be in the game a month after launch
---
Blacksmith seems average- maybe I should go for mining!
---
Yeah getting that piece of gear feels more important, as you'll probably be using it for awhile!  It's like "wow, I got these gloves" And as for brain cells; remember marking mobs in dungeons, using CC and strategic pulling?  Also, BGs we'rent so rushed back then - - actually felt more like a battleground.   I like a lot of aspects of current Wow don't get me wrong, but it's going to be nice to have this ancient world to play on the side!
---
But if it’s not a meme, why am I so triggered over a meme?
---
Mained Rogue in Vanilla, but these days the thought of having a 5 minute vanish cooldown and 3 minute sprint cooldown turn me off the idea. Rogues without cooldowns weren't too fun to play.
---
Will likely roll a mage for a bit more consistency.
---
yeah, and now you want to push it back towards retail after fighting so long to go back to when WoW was actually good.
---
Its funny that leveling alts in BFA and in Vanilla are difficult to do for completelt opposite reasons.
---
In vanilla youve got a massivr journey to take, you learn your class but by bit as more abilitues and talents become available as you progress, and if you manage to take it the whole way to max level you have so much to do.
---
In BFA you have a tedious yet easy journey where you learn your class by like 40, and things stop becoming availavke to you, where you can get to max pretty easily. Then when you do max there isnt much to do cause you gotta grind azerite and can get the nearly best gear of the most recent raid in avout a week.
---
Welcome to one of the best albums in history.
---
this sub seems to forget that the EU playerbase is pretty much as big as the NA playerbase
---
Problem with this is it makes us feel all fuzzy and warm pre-classic release but people seem to refuse to realize what it was like in vanilla post 60, post MC. Once you got your FR for MC and had that on farm, you essentially stood around waiting for raiding. You could play an alt but you were....dum dum dum.....rehashing the same grind that was sooo slow. 
---
I remember a period in WOW Vanilla when I would login to farm for my mats for raids, then later to see if we could even get our 40 man running that night (and what our chances were on pushing new content). 
---
Once the luster of classic is dulled, I think you will see why we ended up being excited to move on from it. Especially if we end up locked in it for longer than Vanilla was Vanilla. Also, don't forget we know everything this time. We know that MC means Molten Core, we know who razorgore is and how Vael will crush your guild and why.
---
Kind of alarming people want to downvote this question and silence it...
---
I don't plan to play it for how it raids. I mained a fury warrior back in vanilla, and I just spammed a single one-button macro for my Execute &gt; Bloodthirst &gt; Whirlwind &gt; Heroic Strike damage rotation. I'm planning to play the spec because it's more desirable for raids, so I'll be better able to get gear, so I'll get to have fun in PvP being a tanky bastard who Holy Shock crits people for 2k.

I believe they are scared that blizzard might use layering/sharding on other occasions. When the server is struggling.

Wut?

weapon skill is pretty OP - you're attacking as a level higher than you actually are. i vote mace.

Apologize for there being no music at the beginning of the video, looks like youtube flagged it for copyright.  This is a pretty raw video of my guild killing onyxia way back in the day - cramped screen with too many Addons, low resolution, poor video quality aplenty, as that was what we had back in the day.  I don't have the exact date for this, but would guess the video to be around 14 years old at this point.

I took 3 weeks. Am I triple-amusing to you ? :D
---
I read de-compose and was like wtf
---
Paladin for me. I started a paladin on Shattered Hand in Dec of 2007 and he's still 'active' today. I haven't played BFA since finding out I couldn't do Mythic raids because the guild I was with is basically a big cross server guild so he's got a bunch of Heroic level Uldir(?) gear.   
---
Depending on how much time I'm able put into Classic could be all trees but I really want to do ret primarily because I miss seals and seal twisting. Got to try it a bit in BC but in Wrath it was heavily neutered. Then Blizz took away all the fun when they removed Seal of Blood/Martyr:

Mining for sure if your other profession is engineering

Sometimes. Sometimes the melee will just keep circling the mob constantly. This is great if it’s a pvp mob, not so much when it’s pve. Usually if the pve mob isn’t moving you won’t have this problem. You can always test it out on the live servers. Just use a trial account for free if you don’t have one. The interact with target option is in the key binding options under targeting.
---
That’s what I was thinking, however I’m no expert on Vanilla.
---
Yes, FoTm can't exist unless you have no life and even then most likely won't be worth it until TBC due to 40 man raids.
---
thinking this sub wouldn't change at all lol
---
Wow, you are a judgemental asshole.  Your poor wife and kid.....im sad for them.
---
Not at all.
---
Why exactly would it be the worst?
---
You can do BGs as any spec. Doing them well is another question...
---
I'm planning to level as skinning and mining, selling or vendoring all leather and saving all ore. The. I'll drop skinning and level engineering at 60. I'll probably keep mining for a long time though and sell a lot of what I get.
---
You're right, Cracked Rear View does have a lot of hits on it
---
You want the axe because it's slower.
---
I doubt they will but anything is possible
---
The huge top end is what makes this axe so good - The sword is pretty close I think, but still lags behind. The axe will really shine once you hit level 40 and can start using Mortal Strike.
---
The onlu boar related quest is to kill 12 boars, not collect parts.  At least in the first 5 levels.

**About me**
---
Hi all I’m Christie, a 25 year old working professional in the US/Best Coast. I played WoW mostly in TBC and WotLK, and fervently played arena and BGs. I got 2200+ in S4 as a priest and plan on playing priest again in Classic, and potentially maybe a pally later. I also briefly played a bit of Cataclysm. I missed out on most of the raid life, and is something I’d like to experience this time because guilds and being part of the community is where the fun is at. Being transparent, I would need a little bit of hand holding for the raids the first few times, but I learn quickly so it shouldn’t be a problem. I’ve played all kinds of games, like LoL, Fortnite, Maplestory, Hearthstone, Audition, Town of Salem, Friday the 13th, etc. When I sold my soul to WoW it was one of the best sales I ever made.
---
My favorite memory was pulling an all-nighter to do a faction raid with 300 people to get the bear mount.
---
**I’m looking for a guild** 
---
I’d want an active guild with a lot of members (80+?) so that there are more opportunities to join raids. I plan to play a lot when the game comes out and can nolife it. However, I do work full-time so I wouldn’t really be able to commit to all the raids since…you know each takes like 4 hours, but I’d like target one or two a week. I prefer a serious guild that is on the young side where people are mature but still troll as hell to match my meme personality. The social part is really important to me as well as our guild reputation. Experienced players with strong leadership is a plus. Members who work in tech is a plus. Alliance faction and PvP server only. Flexible in raid time, just has to be in the evenings (after 630pm) for weekdays. If you are an established guild with a website and a software engineer, my perk is I work as a UX designer and can help design the site.
---
**Also looking for partners**
---
Also looking for leveling partner :) no preference, just more dps heavy.
---
If you think I’d be a good fit for your guild message me on disc Lustless#4411
---
I might hang around a few and see which one I fit in with the most.
---
I was Horde on Kalecgos!
---
Can't remember my major guild's name for the life of me...
---
in vanilla blacksmithing is honestly something you just get to help the guild, and in reverse guild helps you get thorium rep. Letting tanks do things for the guild is actually very good because you already should trust your tanks. But for selfish reasons it's not very useful, it does have a blacksmith only trinket that gives you 30seconds of fear immunity.. but as a warrior fear isn't that big a deal.
---
[WE BACK BOYS!](https://i.imgur.com/SMbYdIE.jpg)
---
The only difference between the weapons is the speed. Sword is 2.9, mace is 3.4 and axe is 3.6. The slower the better so the sword is dogshit but the mace isn’t that much worse than the axe. I believe the .2 speed difference is worth a bit more than +5 skill but not by a lot
---
Another factor would be whether or not you’re arms and what weapon spec you are going. The axe spec is 5% crit as opposed to the chance on hit for a short stun with mace spec (most people would much rather have the crit)
---
Aka axe is probably a bit better still but perhaps if you have 1 skill in axes and maxed mace skill you’d might as well just take the mace
---
The Dodge is very nice but I think the extra threat generation that humans can put out makes them superior
---
Why would we sell Classic runs for Retail gold? We'll be selling runs for Classic gold...

---
So while you can PVP as protection it’s a pretty bad experience and not recommended. The only class you’ll be able to kill is a rogue, and I use the word kill loosely, it’s more like they just can’t kill you whereas everyone else can. 
---
About the only things you’ll be relegated to doing is flag carrying duties and sitting at farm/stables, and that’s exactly what Druids are for and do way better. A well geared tank however can be absolutely critical for a quick AV win. 
---
Blacksmithing can be a money maker with Green Iron stuff while people are leveling and if you’re one of the first to grab a rare pattern like Arcanite Reaper or Lionheart Helm. But nowhere near as good of a moneymaker as Alchemy.
---
My mistake
---
Play what you want. More threat = humans. 1% dodge = nightelf. It really doesn’t make a massive difference.
---
Ah ! Alliance wins, surprisingly
---
This is like hearing that theres more time between Stegosaurus and TRex existing than between TRex and humans
---
It feels like the players loaded in a little slowly when they charged in but in vanilla player view distance was really low.
---
It feels weird because everyone can see the terrain in the far distance now, but back in vanilla most players computers couldn't handle this. 
---
Back in the day the horde tunnel didn't appear in my view until I got half way to mid field for example because of my settings. It more closely matched the distance of which I could see players.
---
Yeah, I'm gonna need a source on that claim.
---
I honestly think a tree form seems weirder than not having a healing form. When I think of the classic druid aesthetic I think of a humanoid who casts spells and some of those spells turn him into an animal so he can do animal stuff. 
---
Casting a spell on himself so he can continue casting spells is weird to me. I also don't love the moonkin form tbh. I feel if a druid is casting he should be the druid. If he wants to do animal stuff he transorms into animals and doesn't cast spells. Spells = Normal form; Animal skills = Animal forms. 
---
Just my opinion obviously, but if I designed druids that would be my basic approach.
---
It's too bad the super speed frost wolves won't be coming back. Now that was wild.
---
Dodge doesn't really matter - it's even the lowest prio mitigation stat. What matters for a tank is threat. Human is the best choice.
---
Then cant you wait another 3 months?
---
&gt; Lupos does not do shadow damage. Brokentooth has 1.0 attack speed.
---
Did you test this or do you think it's going to be like this?
---
&gt; Biggest responsibility as the leader in a guild is to know the boss mechanics and strategy inside and out. 
---
Being the guild leader doesn't mean you're the raid leader.
---
In fact it would be best that both roles are separated.
---
If you going for min/max, then human. When you dodge, you dont get rage and rage is big issue in endgame.
---
You can. I have seen retail pvpers playing classic and calling out the warriors charge/intercept and jumping away and it working. 
---
I think it was Ziqo or another Xaryu. It was a mage
---
Yup I actually remember reading this post on the actual Paladin forum back in the day, kinda crazy.
---
I'm not ready
---
It'll be up for 24 hrs, we will be able to log in later tonight or tomorrow perfectly fine.
---
Flying, million QoL changs, teleports everywhere, AFK in shattrath, old azeroth is obsolete, 5 mans designed for speed-running (thats why they are so forgettable),faction based servers (50-50pop is not viable on TBC and Outland), less social interaction due to flying and 1-70 is turned into a solo game.
---
My mother tongue uses long millions (instead of all -ions, there's a -iard after every -ion) so while I know the prefixes, it's just extremely confusing to think about.
---
I can but I still want to get on the beta and test some things and try some aoe grinding out for practise
---
this DM/VC autism again...  that's it, when I try to get a dungeon group going I'm just going to completely type out Deadmines or Dire Maul (wing) so there is no possibility of a misunderstanding. what good are abbreviations if no one can agree on what which one means?
---
This is roughly my experience. Started 1-2 months after release, age 14, mained a Mage to 45ish and kept getting raped on a PvP server. Rolled a rogue, cause that's so much better? Got the rogue to about 55. My buddy powered through leveling his Priest (he almost quit the game at one point cause he didn't understand the talent system light v shadow priest) and ended up in an elite raiding guild. He finished my rogue out for me and I raided once or twice with his guild in AQ. I knew the game, played a lot of alts, but the raiding portion I never got into.
---
I'd say this is probably the typical experience of most players. Lvl 50 or lower? They probably know the game pretty well. &gt;50? Yeah, that was a very small portion of people that wanted to deal with DKP and getting almost no loot in a 20/40 man raid. And PvP was even more of a grind. And an epic mount? That could take months if you didnt have a guild to raid with.
---
+5 was available too FYI
---
You’re not being foolish but about 3000 posts already said the exact same thing.

---
It's 4 am here in Japan, why on earth would you assume I have pants on in the first place?
---
Yes.  Rogues were not powerhouses by the time 1.12 rolled around.   It was their weakest patch relative to other classes.
---
They're still pretty fun to play, but they aren't close to the "undisputed kings of pvp."
---
They're good at some (many) duels (every 10 minutes) they're good at ganking.  But they're just OK at BG's and are pretty meh at larger scale world PvP.
---
They'll be less rare this time around. When wow first came out warlocks were absolutely terrible... To the point that many never bothered to finish leveling and just rerolled. Now that we're at 1.12 balance levels, you'll see more. Depends a bit in faction though, since people shy away from locks on alliance because of forsaken racial being a hard counter in pvp.
---
Just like quad is the prefix for 4, sept is the prefix for 7.
---
I was on that fine-wine drinking monocle-wearing avant-garde appreciating buzzkilling side until I realized how much I loved WoW back then when I was a kid (granted I played late vanilla and TBC) and any opportunity to relive that moment makes me fucking ecstatic.
---
Dodge chance is one of the worst stats for tanks.
---
Yikes chill out buddy
---
Rats, had no idea. Sorry!
---
From my memory:
---
Horde:  #1 holy priest, #2 disc priest, #3 rshaman, #4 mage, #5 warlock, #6 rdruid
---
Classic will be different then vanilla, for example no one in early MC knew how to play fury.  Everyone seemingly dpsd as arms, so warrior wasn't as in demand.  
---
Top 6 means you will for sure find a raid, but the very tip-top guild on your server will likely only want 2 druids, so they won't be recruiting.  Same guild will want 6-8 priests and 6-8 shamans(some on bench) so will basically constantly be recruiting those classes.  If you aren't worried about being in #1 guild, then druid is a fine pick. 
---
A horde raid has a minimum number of priests (4 to 6), because of dispel fights early in MC, and a minimum number of shamans (5 to 7) because of totems only affecting 1 group each, but theoretical minimum number of druids is 1.  Often extra druids are taken just to even out gear drops, and to fill in for missing priests and shaman.  
---
Here is a chart someone posted before to give a show of class breakdown:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bd5yui/analysis_of_private_server_40man_raid_composition/
---
*quintillion for 5, but correct on the others.
---
What staff has that much spirit early?
---
You have a higher likelihood of being crit while seated?
---
IMAGINE if they take all of this bucketloads of money we're about to give them - and in the first 6 months work incredibly hard in QoL updates... 
---
Texture packs. Matchmaking systems for pvp. Every little minute complaint about bugs/cheaters. Professions tweak (relevancy for some), and EVER SO SLIGHT balance for some of the unloved classes?
---
Man. Imagine.
---
I think there’s plenty of potential to do new stuff with the old zones but who knows if they’ll do it? Probably it’s just gonna be a trip down memory lane with minimal effort from Blizzard, especially since Classic is free (with sub, of course).
---
So assuming you are asking what to pair with engineering to make your tanking better, the only answer is armorsmithing. It is the only profession that would give you something you can not have for tanking from just buying it. Engineering (levle up, crafted needed items, then re specializing and re leveling it) and armorsmithing offer a selection of BOP items to help tank.
---
To make money Blacksmithing CAN make money, but you will need rare patterns.
---
Mining or herbalism will make you money but offer no support for tanking.
---
this x1000, you wrote it perfectly
---
some people coming in to the game are worried about how hard its going to be to get the best stuff. But with vanilla you can be getting some lvl 35 thing and feel amazing about it, you don't need the absolute best instantly to have fun and feel progress
---
&gt; read it, again and again. and again. i guess the wheels have a slow start but you'll get it in the end. i believe in you.
---
It's you, not me. Your terrible grammar makes it difficult to determine an actual coherent thought.
---
&gt; i guess reading is a challenge for you. maybe posting again will help: "btw the guy tanking in the clip has been tanking from DM up to SM with a 2h. you can find the vods in the link provided. so he did it even before having "THE BEST GEAR IN THE GAME!!!!!!111one"
---
Fine. You still don't, and never did, need to be in full mail with a shield to tank Vanilla dungeons, especially when you are equal or higher level. There are a few encounters, but not required by any means.
---
&gt; you make an assumption and want me to find proof? i'm guessing you were hit in the head and never recovered. probably 90% of videos from vanilla are showing tanks with shields. its not even funny how retarded this paragraph is.
---
Just because they were using shields doesn't mean they were required...
---
&gt; it is absolute **bulshit** since there is no 1.12 official patch notes and have mark kern on tape saying that blizzard lost the data and recovered some from nostalrius team. which links up to the fact that they have no official patch notes for vanilla and tbc on site. but hey, how about we **ignore that since it can be actual evidence as opposed to "blizzard said so, it must be true"**. let me share a secret with you **besides the fact that you're a pretentious idiot with no grasp of how a silogism** or burden of proof actually works: yes, companies do lie when it suits them. they manipulate markets, audiences and bent rules. shocking, i know :). like when blizzard deleted bug reports from bfa beta that they couldn't/wont fix. or when they repost videos on youtube to hide the negative replies. or when they ban entire guilds because their own staff made a mistake. mad conspiracies, i know :)
---
Can't spell "Bull". Can't spell "Syllogism". Using words too big for you to spell properly, much less actually comprehend, and I'm the "pretentious idiot". Rofl. 
---
They don't need patch notes when they have video evidence. I like how you completely ignore the evidence provided and result to petty insults. Please, continue proving my point for me.
---
&gt; good job congratulating yourself. that's an exact copy from your unsubstantiated crap. you don't like your own shit? ironic. so, once more, if you don't like my writing, stop reading it. it's that simple.
---
I didn't congratulate myself. You don't even understand basic words, not just the ones you heard once and tried to, invalidly, repeat in an online argument. Lol. 
---
I'm going to stop reading after this one.
---
&gt; yes, elusive 1.12 that has no backup besides "blizzard said so". also, conveniently enough, with no official patch notes.
---
And their current version matches videos of Vanilla, so what's your point?
---
&gt; sure they did, youtube and warcraftmovies is full of clips with players 2h tanking from deadmines up to lich king. oh wait, those are dks. and they're from wrath onward. however, once again, here's how to hyperlink since you seem to forget. dont be shy, share the videos(yes plural) that can back up your assertions.
---
Rofl. My last response has a link, to the video proof and the discussion related to it. Please, keep holding up  your straw man of "You don't know how to hyperlink"
---
&gt; none of YOUR 'arguments' have any validity. see? it's easy. also stupid since you need to back that up and all you can provide is "no, you!" attitude
---
You mean exactly what you are doing?
---
&gt; just because you're emotionally challenged doesn't mean that ppl whinge
---
Says the guy that's this upset about a 15 year old game not using the exact patch that they want. Rofl.
---
&gt; yes, tbc videos.
---
Nope, Vanilla, try again please.
---
&gt; let me know when you take this so i can start up my english class :)
---
Rofl. Done. You can start. It doesn't even have to be something that might be difficult for you. Like reading at a High School level. You can start with Elementary.
---
I would never assume the Japanese folk to wear pants.
---
I've seen things.
---
I'm not big on discord, personally, but I doubt there's much of an option anymore. If I'm playing the game I want to look at the game and not another program.
---
I could've sworn that was one of those things they fixed in a patch relatively quickly, but I could be mistaken. It says on their "Not A Bug" list that Reckoning *not* proccing on sitting is not a bug.
---
You dont love doing 10 billion damage per second to mobs with 500trillion hp? More damage is more better!
---
Awesome answer,  thanks for your time.
---
Try to follow my logic:
---
Holy paladin: Good on everything, but boring on pvp.  
---
Retribution paladin: Bad on pve, but feels good on pvp.  
---
Reckoning is dead without /sit  
---
Holy paladin: Level 40 mount is for free and level 60 mount is even more expensive than normal.  
---
Retribution paladin: PvP reward mounts are free, but you have to farm BGs.  
---
\&gt; Two unique experiences that sound unpleasant to repeat.  
---
Holy paladin: T3 (Redemption Armor) is basically holy only, INT/STA.  
---
Retribution paladin: PvP reward paladin gear is kind of "warrior with healing" style
---
Ret and holy have totally different leveling experiences.  
---
Ret (on pvp) and holy (on pve) need different professions and  consumables.
---
There is no BGs up to a year of server launch, no need to rush a pvp character.  
---
Alterac Valley and Warsong Gulch  only arrives in phase 3.  
---
**My only doubt is if I can pass items from one character to another.**
---
All good homie. Just wanted to give ya the heads up.
---
ah yeah, quint. i was correlating to penthane :)
---
Yeah in large scale pvp they’re basically a fury warrior in full leather that doesn’t have a charge
---
So dramatic.
---
I appreciate it.
---
What makes humans have more threat?
---
who says you cant go back!
---
2 weeks ago i didnt care much. I didnt have the time to do retail and classic and have a life. I thought it would burn out fast.
---
I was out as I do on Wednesday for D&amp;D that I host at a game store and put on youtube for the drive home. It auto played a video of Asmongold being in the beta. I had no idea it was out.
---
I checked my email before i left. Oh shit, i was in wave 1  and had it. Cool i guess.
---
Went home and figured it would take some time to install and it was done in like 15 minutes. Was gonna try it tomorrow but hey why not.
---
Booted it up, went on the old guilds discord we all put together a few months back. I was the only one that got in. They wanted me to stream it so they could see.
---
Fast forward its 2 am cause i had to get talents unlocked.
---
Now 2 weeks in more friends got in. I have 2 level 30s and they are both gnome mages that look identical and a 15 druid.
---
Every doubt i had is gone. 
---
All my complaints and points about why i wouldnt play are overturned. I forgot what it felt like. 
---
Im in.
---
I'm pretty sure you have a 100% chance to be crit while sitting.
---
Heh so I want the only one.
---
My favourite was this
---
&gt; The fuck is a Resto Shaman running around with SIX stacks of ammo for?
---
Exactly this situation, my dude. *Exactly this.* :)
---
**ALL THE GOLD**
---
you can't understand the difference between a $30k salary and a $14k salary? God the retail hate is really a stretch sometimes lol
---
It's a bit of the soul shard farming as well as having to spend gold to upgrade your pets abilities, like it costs gold to get your skills up to date and gold to get your pets skills up to date, and with there being like 5 pets(iirc) with different uses and appeals, it's pretty expensive to be a good warlock I believe
---
Oh so phasing around and losing tags will only be active when the population is bloated enough that it's most needed? Good to know
---
Troll warriors can generate the most threat horde side pve due to berserking and its low cd.  They have that going for them (higher dodge% too even if marginally from higher base agi), and it does help in dps by proccing more WF.  While small, the troll regen passive does make grinding and leveling quite a bit easier, too.
---
well
---
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
---
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
---
so big numbers confuse my little brain
---
You should be leveling as arms and by this level you will have axe specialization because axe spec is the best, thus you should pick the axe. 
---
But if you for some stupid reason chose to go fury then I won't blame you for picking the mace
---
This looks phenomenal, really looking forward to Autoshot support in the future so that I can use it on my Hunter!
---
Problem is mace spec kinda sucks and you'll likely replace WW axe with bonebiter which also uses axe spec.    
---
If you're levelling fury as a human than yeah mace is probably better - sword is too fast though.
---
Proof? 
---
Because from what I've read directly from Blizzard on layering so far, so this a bug and it shouldn't function like this.
---
I think they lead pretty excellent lives. Wife doesn't love her new job and thats shitty, but my kid thinks he's going to grow up to be a wizard so he's pretty fucking stoked and happy all the time.
---
I'm just as judgmental as everyone else, the difference is I don't pretend not to be. Lots of people think that makes me an asshole, I just think those people are vapid and not genuine.
---
The biggest issue with classic wow right now is layering. Its not only problematic but it very reasonably should not be implemented worldwide.
---
The obvious goto solutions: huge server caps, higher dynamic spawns in starting zones, and possibly shard the starting zone only, shared naming pools across server groups that are eligible for merges.
---
For some reason there is a huge push FOR layering on this sub. Its.. very odd, imo. Seems like people want to actually silence any discussion on the topic with "its only beta" and "there is no other way" and of course downvotes.
---
This is such a huge part of why I couldn't get into later expansions. Part of the excitement of gear and progression in this game is based on numbers. If the numbers aren't easy to read and remember, that excitement is gone. Critting for 1k the first time - awesome. 370k - who cares. 
---
Obviously there were other factors too, like welfare epics, stat balance, and transmog, that kill the excitement of new gear.
---
You seem pretty dedicated (you don't mention any time constraints), so I'll assume you have plenty of time on your hands. In this case, you should make an alt to do the gathering. That way you can have two main professions on your main, and two gathering professions on your alt. Make the alt a hunter, and you can even do gold farming with it in Maraudon (maybe DM:N)
---
They ran it at lvl 30 and the boss is 26. If they didnt dale walk it I would be worried
---
Will classic servers be blended in with players from other servers? I'd really like it if it wasn't, so you'd get to know your community and reputation within it matters.
---
I raided enhance in vanilla. Mostly as a charity case because I was fun to be around. I wasn't the lowest dps, and every once in awhile I'd be top on a given fight in MC. I was never #1 in anything past MC tier.
---
Was a paladin first time around, but didnt hit max until tbc. Will be going hunter this time
---
How she backflips on evicerate...
---
FD is a spell and is resistible. If any mob you are in combat with resists it then you stay in combat
---
W is forward. Seems legit. You are officially *not* a keyboard turner.
---
For what it's worth, outside of dungeons/raids/PVP, I still keyboard turn when soloing. Usually when I am eating with my right hand, and playing one-handed. WASD + tab target + keybinds 4 lyfe.
---
^\(This ^also ^works ^for ^faptime, ^not ^that ^I ^would....)
---
I rerolled to another server after AQ40 was released in a search for better PVE progress. Remember so many people from AD tho, I recognise the name Ardante and Romanov from the s/shot.
---
Dueling is very different from group pvp, battlegrounds and world pvp (both small and large scale).
---
Its much harder to CC or kite / deadzone melee when there are multiple opponents.
---
well atleast warriors have aoe fear and thunderclap. and ps.
---
Human is definitely the best.  Dodge is ok early but with higher gear levels it becomes negligible at best.
---
Also remember weapon skill also reduces boss parry rate which reduces damage you take as well (even though it's small).
---
Wow, even simply reading the story made we appreciate how you must've felt! Beautiful!
---
&gt;By opting into a spellblade type build, prioritizing melee hit, melee crit, and spellpower over all other stats, you can use external spell coefficients to outpace standard ret builds
---
This is a similar in concept to Sapheal's build (removed link cause I guess automod wasn't a fan and not trying to break rules) or [The retardin](http://vanillagaming.org/forum/index.php?topic=7632.0;wap2), assuming those are the meme specs you are talking about. God that  link has been chilling in my bookmarks so long i don't think the website works on my browser... excited to see it making sense on the actual Blizzard build.
---
It's pvp only yes.
---
They're above average duellers. In group pvp combat yeah they're probably a bit below average but they have a niche and are useful in BGs still. I don't think rolling one for PvP is a mistake, every class has strengths and weaknesses. Rogue is easily one of the most fun classes to play.  
---
Yes back stab costs a lot of energy but there's 100 energy thistle tea and ZG trinket so you can easily do 3 backstab crits in a kidneyshot if you time it right for some serious burst.
---
how is that a false equivalency? you quite literally said 30,000 is too big of a number for your brain to process
---
Weapon skill.
---
Rogue only sucks when you are completely out of cooldowns and caught out of stealth. Other than that they are an excellent PvP class. Very good flag defense in WSG/AB. Very good flag return/assault in WSG/AB. Acceptable flag runner in WSG after feral druid and frost mage. Great for objectives in AV. Great 1v1 even against top counters if your skill cap is high.
---
Edit: Also you cannot judge anything off of beta, rogues are missing a lot of tools being capped at level 30.
---
Just logged in, seems to be fixed today. But he still draws his quiver for melee :D
---
There’s nothing wrong with wishful thinking, besides the inevitable disappointment that you set yourself up with when wishing for the impossible. There’s no better solution for the massive influx of players at launch besides layering/sharding and that’s just something you’ll have to accept or you’ll just bring unnecessary disappointment to yourself. Pservers don’t deal with this because they’re never going to experience a launch with this many people interested.
---
Billions lol, trillions easily. It's retarded.
---
well to be fair a game thats not yet released is all hype fuel and there is less to complain about
---
but yeah BFA is underwhelming
---
I honestly forgot that numbers even existed in the game before classic beta released. All I ever knew from retail WoW was that a critical meant a semi-significant chunk of health was lost.
---
From your memory, by the time we got to the later patches, what classes were dominating the most in pvp?
---
Tbh I agree with you. I’d love to blow vacation time on classic...but my pride and self respect prevent that. 
---
That said, I’m 29 now with a career job. Put me in my last year of college or when I was working at a grocery store going to community college part time—and fuck ya, if I can make rent, I’m blowing all my time off on wow.
---
Imagine telling your coworkers what you’ll be doing on vacation. Or telling your gf you’ll “be away, but not really”
---
I’m not 16-25 anymore, I exercise everyday so I can maintain and still eat what I want. A week off eating garbage sitting in the dark hunched over a bright screen would fuck me up for a month or two.
---
And all so I can start farming mc week 2 and abuse layers to mine/herb 12 servers worth of resources at a time so I can dominate the second coming of a 15 year old solved game. 
---
I dunno maybe I’m getting older. I used to raid 30+ hours a week and shit talk casuals who only raided 20.
---
&gt;The possibilities are endless!
---
No there's only like 60-80 possibilities if you account for all classes and all spec options.
---
Wow I was on argent dawn too back then. The memories :)
---
And you're critizing them. C'mon, fuck it. Enjoy Classic man!
---
I know many alliance rogues will usually prioritize a non-orc player first just because of the high resist chance of stun.  That in itself is a pretty large boon for say an orc shaman or warlock.
---
I guess my point is that the scale is going to be something we've never seen before with vanilla wow. Larger streamers are going to be bringing 10s of thousands with them, especially if it's multiple communities all joining the same realm (as looks to be the case).
---
Sure there may be some competition with hardcore guilds farming, but they don't have the manpower to control a zone like a streamer community would. There may be times where all farming spots are effectively claimed because of sheer numbers.
---
I think you're again not granting the scale of what streamer communities will do. We're talking about one faction getting an influx of 10s of thousands while the other doesn't.  Some realms in vanilla were very one sided so I suppose that's potentially authentic to the vanilla experience.
---
Scale for launch may be solved by their layering tech, but that is scheduled to go away eventually. Even then, these large communities will want to play together so will likely all join into the same layer. If you're unlucky enough to find yourself sharing their layer GG. Even past that, when the layers are merged , a realm with a massive streamer or (worst case) several large streamers is going to be significantly more populated than an average realm. Sharding isn't going to exist in classic so spooling up and down servers isn't going to help.
---
While these problems will probably even out over time, I feel like that's too late for a large number of people. Especially if something simple can help mitigate it.
---
Stratholme / Scholomance / UBRS were that hard, and they were 'end game' dungeons and they're what most people spent time upon and remember as the baseline for difficulty. 
---
The lower level dungeons were much, much easier.
---
Cataclysm dungeons were tuned towards TBC era dungeons, particularly Shadowlabs / Shattered Halls.
---
it went completely out of hand from cata onwards. went from 20-30k hp to 100k
---
A lot less bank space
---
People have sold boost since the game's inception my friend. It'll be nothing new in Classic.
---
Apparently enough to pay a years worth of subscriptions to do it. I think the world would be a better place if grown adults could show at least an ounce of self restraint.
---
It's been pretty good.
---
I can remember a few instances where I added people to my friends list and am still interacting with them
---
-There's a warrior, rogue, and warlock who were part of a RFK group I joined. They were pretty nice to play with and we helped each other out with getting BIS (we 3 manned RFK to get me Corpsetaker and the rogue a really good dagger, the rogue helped me with a quest for a bis chest and crafted bis bracers, and the warlock gave me some nice enchants, so I mail him the greens I happen to get.)
---
-There's a shaman who asked me to craft them FAPs since they had the mats. After that, they resold them on the Auction House for a higher profit. Instead of feeling ripped off, I offered to get Stranglekelp if they fished up Oily Blackmouths, and we could split the profits (We did do that, but unfortunately those potions didnt end up selling). They also helped me with the quest to get a bis chest.
---
-And there is a druid who helped me compile a list of BIS items I could work toward. If it werent for that, I wouldn't have tried to go for many bis items simply because I wouldnt have known which ones to get. Because of this, I got a lot more enjoyment out of the level 30 meta.
---
Pentane
---
Well yeah, reddit is American and Americans tend to forget the rest of the world exists.
---
This was never a secret fishing is just boring af
---
At least give us the exact number 🙄
---
37, my girlfriend did 37 flips...
---
In a row?
---
Only spot I don’t see putting hybrids in when it comes to raid is MT slot. I’m not punishing 39 other players because one Paladin/Druid wants to special snowflake. MT slot is a warrior slot. DPS is way less important of a role. OT even I could see utilizing a hybrid class as long as they put in the effort to be geared/consumabled for the job. 
---
Hybrids will have to put in twice the effort as pure  classes to preform well for sure. But Main Tank is no negotiable. 
---
Now when/if BC Classic hits no limits baby.
---
Are alliance warlocks really that rare? Planning on pugging raids and dungeons when I have time and don't want to spend 1 hour lf a dungeon group (stuck between hunter and warlock and ally vs horde)
---
Happy to help. I only ever played Druid in Cats on live. Once I tried them on a private server, though, I knew that was going to be my class in Classic.
---
Everything feels very fluid as long as you're paying attention and know how to use your skills. Being able to adapt to situations out in the world feels really great, and the fact that you get things like movement speed in cat form make it a very fun and rewarding class to play and level as.
---
A humorous post? About liking classic WoW more than current WoW? On the classic WoW subreddit?
---
Nonsense.
---
Pretty sure you meant Tauren or Orc?
---
Duskwood.
---
No. I wasn’t a pessimistic asshole.
---
Of course, not everyone you meet has to be on your friends list. There will be many people that you meet while questing or during dungeon runs or inside major cities and dont talk to much. You might recognize their name every so often, or you might forget about them entirely.
---
when its flying around constantly and there are 7 other numbers popping up sure 
---
when we are talking about one static salary figure thats a bit different
---
actually its worlds different, not even same ball park, heck not even same mfing sport
---
Quintillion (5).
---
62!
---
I was thinking maybe after Naxx they could implement the talent trees that existed in the 2.0 patch. It would allow Blizzard to tune the dungeons going forward in a different way. I dunno though.
---
Used to happen all the time in classic so they don't have to disenchant drops
---
Lol, let's see you be in an AQ/Naxx guild and be forced to go into MC even though you need nothing there.
---
No outdated content my ass. Once you get BWL gear you never step foot into dungeons again except maybe Stratholme for rep farm.
---
Gonna have to meet up. You get some class/race quest early on so you dont want to leave the area too early. For me and my buddies since im probably going NE and they are going dwarf or human. We will meet up in wetlands in the 20s I believe and go from there.
---
There has also never been a period in WoW's history where "relevant content" was an area as large as Classic WoW. So, since BC, we have been playing in a smaller relevant game world than the one at launch. 
---
Scaling was a half measure towards actually realizing a whole Azeroth but, in general, Blizzard seems pretty happy with the two year expansion cycle and retail being a focused experience on a smaller, new play area until the next one.
---
Why are people so obsessed with weapon speed, wasnt it normalized already in 1.12?
---
i think its just generally easier to notice the difference with 3 max 4 digit numbers.. etc but i see your point
---
The axe has a slightly higher top-end which is good for all the instant attacks warriors get like Overpower, Whirlwind and Mortal Strike, but the real reason everyone takes the axe is for the weapon talents. When you're leveling, you *want* to level as Arms, nothing else can compare; you get the talents that allow stance-dancing, you get additional crit damage, and you get Mortal Strike. Because you're so crit-focused, you'll then want to use an axe for the 5% crit talent before getting the 5% melee crit from the Fury tree on top of that.
---
Dual-wield Fury is better damage in the end-game, when you can stack a bunch of melee hit% gear and find better weapons, but you can't beat axe-spec arms early on.
---
I am very casually playing a TBC pserver while I wait. I am not going to be getting a retail account until mid August, so no beta for me. I'm enjoying watching the streamers as well.
---
I didn't use Decursive even after it got nerfed cause it was never smart - it just randomly removed curses and I preferred to make sure priority people were decursed first, so it must have been HealBot.
---
I feel like I remember manually cancelling my casts in naxx though, but maybe I just didn't know about that option. 
---
I was mostly disc cause I was the one that provided the spirit buff in our raid, but I don't ever really remember much heal sniping though I can honestly only really remember healing a few naxx bosses, even though I obviously did heal through the rest of the content too.
---
Dumb question but as an EU player do you have to log to NA client to see if you got in beta? Since there were no e-mails, how will one know if they get in?
---
Burn out wasn't a thing back then for me. I could play 12 hours a day. Its been only recently that I can only stand so much wow before I get bored.
---
/s
---
of the day
---
Best part was later which isn't shown, they asked if he is doing the stress test, said he can't be bothered
---
Not in the same way that you could wrath. In classic when you get stunned/rooted, you would get stuck in the air or wherever you happened to be because the game didn't support the same kind of Y axis movement like the one flying mounts and such use. Jumping a warriors charge had less to do with the jump itself and more to do with the game calculating the charge to X position while you could manage to move to Y before your character was affected. Come wrath it was about actual jumping, the calculations happened faster but if you were in the air, mid jump, you would literally land out of post-charge warrior range :p
---
Ratings were necessary to keep some high level vanilla items from being BiS into later expansions. I don't like it either but functionally it was necessary.
---
Winterspring
---
Tanaris
---
Hillsbrad
---
Duskwallow Marsh
---
Feralas
---
The biggest problem with classic is bc was announced and released and we never got the aq catch up raid as zg was to mc and aq20 was to bwl. 
---
Otherwise classic pretty well executes on its concept. 
---
Karazhan should have been a 20 player vanilla raid situated between aq40 and naxx in difficulty.
---
Because it's not time....
---
While I don't know how common tidal charms will be, a class that is prone to stuns such as a shaman or warlock its massively beneficial to have that stun resist racial.  Even if the other horde racials are quite good.
---
In all honesty, there is no "bad" pick for Horde mages, shamans, hunters, warriors, or priests. All the races on horde have some really good synergies with their classes.  It just depends on player choice of what aethitics they like and which racials they value higher.
---
For a non-pvp player, the stun res isn't the selling point.  But for someone pvp focused, it absolutely could be.  But that doesn't discoutn the fact that say a Tauren Warrior doesn't have its own unique pros and cons (increased hitbox, but higher melee range v an orc increased AP from Blood Fury, but less healing effect).
---
Horde is interesting like that.
---
Vanilla WoW (and Classic by extension) doesn't have dailies or weeklies.
---
Mage 2% hit chance (elemental precision) is the meta
---
I was 8! 
---
My grandfather played and he bought me the game for Christmas! We played together until he passed away in Wrath. I still log in to his account to make sure his character names never get taken.
---
&gt;the hunter that forgot/simply doesn't know how to disable growl on his pet
---
If a Warrior is losing aggro to a hunter pet he's shit at the game honestly.
---
Growl is not a taunt. It does not force the mob to attack the Hunter pet ( whereas Taunt FORCES the mob to attack the Warrior ). It just causes a lot of threat. Like Distracting Shot, or a 5000 damage spell. As a Hunter I pull aggro off my pet when I solo farm Maraudon, meaning if my pet can pull aggro from a Warrior tank, then I as a hunter will also pull aggro from the Warrior.
---
And if I as a Hunter can pull aggro, DPS that do more damage than me -- Warriors, Rogues, Mages, Warlocks -- will also pull aggro.
---
i.e. the Tank is crap and isn't doing his job.
---
You would need 12k hp in order for +5% to be 600...
---
Warrior BiS for all of vanilla gives about half of that.
---
You have a skewed sense of who is playing Beta. Those streamers are doing their part by giving non-beta invitees eyes on the game.
---
Thousands of other players, like myself, are the ones messing around testing things and reporting bugs as we go.
---
I reported about 7 things yesterday and have around 35 overall reports since beta opened.
---
You want the axe. No matter the race. Two reasons. You want a slower attack speed so your instant attacks do more damage. You also want to take the axe spec in the arms tree. That, coupled with Cruelty, gives you 10% crit from talents.
---
understandable
---
I'm considering the same as you. If you have absolutely no preference on looks, and sokey care about racial, go with gnome.
---
That being said, I'll be rolling human mage. I think gnomes are cool, but I could never play as one. They are too short and I want to show off armor, relate to my character, etc. Perception could be useful too, and the increased rep is always nice.
---
In PvE gnomes will perform like 2-3% more DPS, and in PvP escape artist is nice. But you can still perform very well on a human.
---
If you are talking end game, you will not be rage starved.
---
good for you
---
It hasn't really had log representation at any serious capacity, and it's never been pushed as hard as it's being pushed now. MCP ret, as far as I know, is a VERY new concept, and SoR proccing on hit weapon effects was never added to classic downported mangos or the nost core. Quite a few things have changed from the private server version of the build, and the legitimate 1.12 version of Paladin looks a LOT stronger than private server paladin based on the interactions we've tested and a lot of the datamining we've done.
---
&gt;why rely on your own sense of timing and experience while making combat decisions when you can have an addon do it perfectly for you?
---
Some people want to play as optimally as possible and this allows them to do so. All this addon does is provide information, how that information is used depends on the skill of the player. How is a swing timer any different than a cast timer? Why don't casting classes needs timing and experience? The durations are known. 
---
I love addons because they allow me to display the information I need to optimize my class/role efficiently into a workable ui. It seems like you're just deliberately lowering your skill ceiling as an excuse for why people are better than you.
---
Or for a cheeky paladin looking to get a cheap shot in with reckoning stacks in say STV.
---
Lol! If only..
---
Okay, but this is a CLEAR bug with a relatively straight forward cause (recomputed later with party change) and fix (monsters go to layer current target is on).
---
There is zero reason to speculate this won’t be fixed.
---
Idk man apparently some people think it's sad, pathetic and disgusting.
---
Daily didn’t show up until TBC. There were repeatable quests (blue question mark) but they weren’t limited to daily or weekly completions.
---
Damn. You're right.
---
since only 1 hot is allowed, in classic you will actually want to see all hots on a target (whether that is yours or someone else's). That way, if you see someone else's hot on the target, you will know not to waste your mana casting your own hot on that same target.  1 renew, 1 rejuv, and 1 regrowth allowed on a target.
---
&gt;This is for discussion.
---
The people who screech the refrain "NO CHANGES!" are what happened.
---
All discussion is shut down unless it conforms to a literal 1:1 recreation of what we had.
---
Which on the whole, I'm for. But the sheer level of vitriol pushes me away from siding with them.
---
That would be stealing!
---
These things aren't mutually exclusive. We can be open to sharing something we care about, and frustrated that the new wave of retail players now outnumber us and are lobbying for changes under the illusion of being part of our community. 
---
I don't mind new people coming in and sharing Classic WoW, I welcome it, it really is amazing! What I DO mind is when the same people who this time last year were spamming the wall of no over at /r/wow come to this sub and post about "yeah vanilla is great but how about we fix it up with change X Y Z."
---
That’s fair enough, not sure why you’re being downvoted tho
---
No thanks. Wasn’t in vanilla, don’t add it.
---
And the NR for aq. Threat is probably better, but daggers come in to play t top tiers and it will become negligible.
---
Oops - something went wrong.
---
Dailies were not introduced until TBC.  In vanilla, you had to have your own agenda and set of priorities of doing things.  The game didn't lay it out in front of you like that.
---
I find it really hard to believe that its possible to seriously give it a shot and end up with a *worse* solution than this one.
---
You can call it wishful thinking all you want, but if we are uncritical of bad solutions, we will never have a good one.
---
a few, but not all, reasons I think retail is in a shitty spot personally:
---
\- Newer patches completely cannibalize older patches. They found a way to make dungeons relevant all expansion and have a means to give players gear that is competitive throughout, but don't do the same for older raid tiers which are harder to organize from the outset because of larger group sizes and bigger timesinks. Classic and BC did this really well, just because the best gear drops in the newest raid doesn't mean the other raids are no longer relevant. Molten Core/Ony and Karazhan were raided every week from their release to the end of the expansion.
---
\- Exponential scaling of player power. A freshly capped character is going to be hilariously undergeared for any content that requires groups. There are catchup mechanisms but the gap is so large that level cap may as well be a 10 character level range difference from ungeared to geared because of how much power you gain from gearing up. My raidgeared characters can do over triple what my fresh capped characters can do and if you are caught in limbo between ungeared and geared, you aren't numerically good enough until you hit a specific gear threshold.
---
\-- Way WAAAAAY too many gear catchup mechanisms. Even with as wide as the golf is, if you are committed to climbing it, you will gear up insanely fast to the point of gear feeling like a tacked on feature rather than a progression system. What's more, you hit the theoretical cap of the content you are doing so fast that you quickly find yourself without anything to do. If you freshly ding level cap, you can gear up in normals to then do heroics to then do lfrs to then do mythics in an afternoon, even quicker if you have things like timewalking/overwhelming odds/warfronts/etc at your disposal. It doesn't take long before you are doing things in the hopes of getting lucky with warforging/titanforging, personally I lose interest at that stage really quickly. What really bugs me about this is that even with all of the gear, you never hit a point where you feel like you are jumping ahead of the powercurve in any significant way, it feels very on rails and checking off boxes on a list. "do these tasks until you can do these other tasks until you are ready to do those tasks."
---
\- The world content just isn't threatening at all and thusly just isn't engaging at all from a game standpoint. Even at low gear levels, you start the expansion being the super king of awesome town and gear just makes an already god mode character more god mode, so there isn't any sense of becoming more powerful, things just take less time to do. All things in the world have an expected outcome of success, there isn't any sense of "I might need to bring a few friends to do this" or "this is going to be difficult to complete" which is boring as fuck.
---
\- Very muddled 5 man difficulty curves. This isn't necessarily a fail, more so something that bugs me specifically, but due to how 5 mans scale with level, they should straight up remove what heroic difficulty currently exists as from the game. There isn't a need for a level cap exclusive difficulty for queueable content that isn't designed to be particularly difficult when scaling dungeons/dungeon loot can fill that need pretty easily. Have normal mode be LFD, have heroic fill what mythic 0 is now, and have mythic+ exist as it currently is. Have level cap stuff be tuned to be harder from the outset instead of a guaranteed success and design trash to require shit like CC and stuff to be used instead of pull everything and AoE it down, I fucking hate that 5 man design hasn't evolved at all since Wrath in that regard.
---
All of these gripes all point to one underlying fact about retail: it's just way WAY to quick of an experience. They need to dial back the speeds in which players can achieve and grow substantially and have tangible growth from achieving and growing. If I can start the experience blowing through everything, what incentives do players have to get more powerful? If that power doesn't cost any real investment or have any trials to endure to achieve, where is the satisfaction of doing it? I normally level and gear alts in expansions that I run out of things to do on my main but even that feels bad with how things are now.
---
The talent trees that were designed for level 70?
---
Horde bias
---
Slightly confused.  So are you saying the Classic Beta functions like the video I provided? or does it function like retail does now?
---
ret pallies are one of the best if not the best pvp class in grouped premade arathi basin.  
---
played healer in my hc guild had ret gear, me and another paladin could hold ground for long and win 2vs5 even.  
---
problem is most dont have engineering and dont know how to use their spells proper.  
---
SoC procc can deal more dmg than a WF procc.  
---
and they melt warriors like cheese due to magic dmg.however the dmg is unrealiable just like wf.  
---
But unlike shamans they have bop/LoH/BoF  and the oh shit button of immortality to buy time dfending the cap in ab.  
---
they are just not ever to be be mocked as a pvp class. ret on pve deal pretty avarage numbers, but all of us who played in vanilla know that bosses dmg checks did never wipe you, it was healing numbers and fuckups. nothing else.
---
Simplicity is golden
---
I would be beyond pissed. You can't keep adding increasingly powerful loot without also changing class balance. Nothing exists in a vacuum in a game of this size. Once you start adding new stuff, it will effect a lot more then you think.
---
Common miss information spread like wildfire on this sub yes.
---
Eh, I would rather them spend time on Classic+ rather than just rehashing the dungeons/raids over and over.
---
Might been fixed in 1.12.0 eventually but at one point you could have too good gear and not get any rage.
---
so keys for this stress test were sent out already?
---
Yup my fav zone
---
Scaling was added as a fix to Retail because you leveled past low-level zones so fast there was no reason to ever complete any zones quest chains. You'd be 1/3 done with a zone when it was time to move on because you'd leveled past it.
---
Anyone else hear and orc voice saying that?
---
And I'm and alliance player
---
By the time we got to the later patches, there was a whole lot more gear available to classes that needed it for scaling. That won't be the case in Classic because the gear is time-gated.
---
Casters are gonna have a hard time until AQ drops. There's just not enough spell power available until then.
---
Hunters will be good until AQ drops. They just don't scale with gear well.
---
The rest were always pretty well balanced.
---
I will say, a R14 rogue was rare. Premade PVP was rough for Rogues because of how good Warriors are with pocket healers. AV was the exception. Rogues were great there.
---
The ability to plan and pick your fights is unmatched in world PVP as a rogue.
---
Blizzard want/don't want the account sharing. They want/don't want to deal with account thefts. Personally I think that a guild bank, maybe even a more expensive one, would be a good compromise.
---
I love the game but we will ruin it. Multiboxing will be very prevalent. I really think we should not have quest addons until after the leveling process. Factions will be horribly off balance as people choose optimally. I'm going to try and make the best of it but I think this iteration of the game will fail because we will optimize our way into playing like we are in BFA.
---
1: STV
---
2: The rest
---
Nah, I think he was talking about human or nightelf. Correct me if I’m wrong
---
There is no scenario where phase 2 launches with layering. Won’t happen. Beta is there to fix shit yet you complain when shit isn’t right. 
---
Have you submitted a bug report thru official channels with this clip? Or are you just here to complain on reddit
---
I agree. Imo better comparison would be your yearly salary would be 14k (lol) but after an upgrade you start to earn 30k monthly
---

---
I always mix the 5 and 7 places when going to quint and sept
---
I'd be completely fine with guild banks as it helped contribute and got the guild more involved with eachother.
---
Big upvote, it's on patient players to call out the toxicity.
---
If we see someone taking an elitest attitude, shame it!
---
Would be ironic if after classic releases people come out with private servers capped at 30 to recreate the classic beta experience.
---
Well then bring a friend, easy enough 🙃, druid can do quite alot solo stuff also outdoors
---
I'm sure there will be. I'd check the looking for guild discords or maybe start one up. 
---
But just so you don't feel bad when the time comes, very few people actually learned everything by trial and error. I was a day 1 account and was in a more advanced guild, and even for me when it came time to get attunements or with complicated encounters people had already at least gotten a rough idea of what we needed to do. A very very small set of bleeding edge progression people did all the heavy lifting there and the information disseminated pretty quickly.
---
Infinite scaling makes a game feel completely meaningless. Why even bother working on the strongest build you can get when there is no ceiling on the difficulty of the enemies?  Does it really matter if you can do a 10 trillion damage crit when your enemies can endlessly scale?
---
I'd do this on a pserver all the time. Didn't think it was that hard as I'd jump across the map all the time.
---
yeah I'd say "easier" is a bit different than "can't literally process this"
---
Paladin and Warrior :P
---
You ever heared of the ogre suit?
---
A stress test that will last until tuesday reset? Doubt that's gonna happen
---
Vanilla WoW is more difficult in the "be aware of what is around you" sense than an "enemies are way tougher" sense. In Vanilla, a lot of the time dying just came down to either aggroing a patrolling mob, or not seeing that extra mob behind a tree, or not being far enough away from a group and having the mob you were fighting run into that one.
---
In retail, you can just steamroll your way to whatever objective you're going on. But in Vanilla, you had to look carefully at how each mob was positioned.

Have you reported it?
---
Hi, /u/ClassicRave
---
You can cry about it when the game actually gets released.
---
12/31/2004
---
New years eve LAN party :D
---
I wish they'd add a search bar in that menu, because there is truly an insane amount of icons now. Icons are the one thing I can't just recognize and tell you where it was first used
---
Almost all of them.
---
Waiting a few hours for the stress test, can't log in from 1 AM to 3 AM, go back to sleep feeling betrayed and empty inside
---
Classic Stress test in a nutshell
---
I 100% believe Blizzard is going to introduce Guild Banks with Phase 3. They just don't want to say so now because they've got a lot more on their plate with the server stuff and the marketing value of "we're listening, #nochanges, we swear" is too strong until after you get everyone on the addiction tit.
---
I mean you’re not wrong
---
For the Horde baby!
---
The only question that matters.
---
&gt;Which on the whole, I'm for. But the sheer level of vitriol pushes me away from siding with them.
---
Then forget about all that and say what you think about guild banks.
---
I'm ok with no guild banks. 95% of the time they're used just to store pointless shit anyway. Limited bag space is an important concept in vanilla that massive guild banks would really damage the feel of. In any guild you know who the 5 people are that can do useful stuff with their professions, it's not hard to organise with them if you need anything.
---
Can playing with a holy paladin support alleviate some of this? Freedom, Cleanse, etc.?
---
I disagree. I think Guild Banks would be a great addition to Vanilla.
---
Yes. Add them.
---
My first character was an undead female called PonyMustang (I love the car). I leveled till 19 then created an belf female hunter called Danae.
---
One month later I went back the rogue and it has been my main since then. (many changes of name, server...)
---
I remember the Barrens striders as being annoying and the oasis as a death trap haha
---
Logic doesn't really apply here. Even if this is for the best, it still feels like shit and most of us would rather be in the beta. If we want to avoid that feeling, we could easily play an off-class we wouldn't touch in live. 
---
That being said, the truth is a lot of people either already started on private servers and will get burned out because of that, or they will try to wait patiently and burn out on the hype itself before the game even launches. I can't recall specific games, but there's been plenty of times where a game starts hyping people up months to a year before release, and by the time it comes out I just don't give a shit anymore and don't even pick it up. That is how much I burned out on the hype, I can't even bother to remember the fucking names of them.
---
I think Blizzard is making a mistake with long betas. Obviously its not done yet and they shouldnt rush it by any means, or allow everyone into the beta, but by making it last so long and all the streamers having access, it's really wearing thin on people and going to work against them. It wont stop classic from being successful by any means, but a little hype goes a long way, a lot of hype can hit a fucking wall and cause lower numbers.
---
if you are looking for a "challenge" in PvE stay in retail, no one wants it here.
---
There's a few discords, but no condensed guide. There's still some disagreement about itemization and exact sim values, so we havent really pushed a full guide public yet, but I hope to do so after classic comes out. I could probably make a 45+ minute deep dive into the spec and throw it on YT, and I also plan on steaming classic when it comes out. 
---
Here's the ret discord. https://discord.gg/aHNGN7
---
We've got private server raiders, Classic beta testers, and theorycrafters.  Feel free to stop in and say hello. It's pretty disorganized all in all ATM, we don't have more than a few sticky posts, and if you're looking for a 'guide', we don't really have one put together yet. Eventually I'll get around to writing, recording, editing, and uploading a full guide, but I honestly want to get a picture of the level 60 metagame before I do, and when I do it'll get paired with a handful of montages and other fun stuff.
---
I would rather they just release a heroic server where you start at 1 and the entire game is harder with no loot changes. Over this idea anyway.
---
Pro.
---
I'm also pro transmog.
---
But anti-class balancing.
---
Nah, i'm just a huge nerd who spends too much time on theorycrafing discords.
---
It does not proc on a sit, like in privates.
---
But it procs standing, like it did in vanilla.
---
You have to sit and stand really fast, and use the spell batching in your favor. Like, you have to get crit via sitting, but then in the same "batch" you have to stand up, so the game thinks you got crit while standing and then the buff procs accordingy.
---
You are very welcome. Got loads more where that is from. And yes, it is german. :)
---
Shadow priest?
---
If this is happening at 2PM PDT what does that mean in UK time?
---
&gt; uses long millions
---
Milllllllllllllllllllllllllllions
---
In beta, layering seems to work wrong and act like phasing. Good thing there is beta and hopefully this will be fixed for release.
---
Gnome by far.
---
Don't really understand what exactly would be "worst" in this.
---
I was happy for the people who cared.
---
Then I had another look at several MMORPGs, realized I want that oldschool community and slow crawl back...
---
And then Classic was announced. Did a full 180.
---
please no, if you are looking for new content stay in retail
---
I'll told you what we did back then, Guild bank would only stock raid drops from MC/AQ/Naxx and Elementium and the T1 drop that none needed and this was catalogued on our website. 
---
Other mats people wanted to give to help the guild, we told them to send it to our main tanks because at that time it was really hard for them to survive and be ready for raids because of all the repair cost and the fact it was harder to farm in def spec.
---
Thats exactly it, or farm some dungeons for gold if he is rolling mage or hunter, even paladins and locks can farm too.
---
I think it's the same people from the first stress test. I'm not sure if more have been invited since then.
---
I think they're only allowing players that were invited to the last one to play
---
:)
---
To elaborate, I've created one for a very similar purpose. We already have 59 members (so it's kind of full). No rush, no guides, let's play the game and learn it that way.
---
Of course as it happens most of our members are veterans. :) Most people enthusiastic about the game are people who are coming back. But we are a laid back bunch and will approach raids as "new" for those who are really new to them (even a lot of veterans didn't have the opportunity to raid or didn't get far). After we had our fill of story, setting and wiping we can consult guides (or not) as needed.
---
My point is that a whole guild of complete new players to the game might be hard to come by (but you can try to find/create one!) but guilds which are welcoming to new people will be plenty.
---
how do you log into a private server? I can't figure it out
---
I get that, and I feel the same, but I also believe that being a part of Discord will give us an advantage :)
---
Someone disagrees with your opinion? Better flame them and tell them to relax and calm down. 
---
Sorry I don’t want to join in the circle jerk, seems like there’s no room.
---
Lol at people downvoting this.
---
Yes, nobody expects Betas to be perfect, but downvoting major bugs to decrease visibility is a great way to ensure the bug stays in the game upon release.
---
Since when did this sub become oversaturated with Blizz fanboys who want to see NOTHING that suggests Classic isn't already in a perfect state?
---
Does nobody remember the huge unfinished buggy sack of shit BfA was? And how they turned a complete deaf ear to test realm feedback?
---
These bugs will likely still be the in game on release if Blizz keeps up their track record.
---
This is a remake of a 2004 Blizzard game but its becoming increasingly clear that its still a 2019 Blizzard product.
---
very few guilds will be premade, it only works if you know people in advance really, so basically just pserver guilds.
---
I dont really see the need for them, they were a minor convenience and were easily susceptible to corruption for newer guilds/players. As evidenced from the fact that I robbed quite a large share of items from a zerg guild in WotLK over a long period of time without them noticing.
---
You gonna choose your rogue based on the kick animation?
---
&gt; **Why aren't we talking about guild banks anymore?** 
---
Because it wasn't in Vanilla and therefore shouldn't be implemented in Classic.
---
It took me longer than I'd like to admit to figure out why they called Dead Mines VC in vanilla when I started playing.  I was firmly in the calling it DM club till I started doing Dire Maul runs.
---
Walking into that open garden park in Dire Maul East was nightmare fuel back then.  "Look at all those mobs!"
---
I agree the game will feel whole again in Classic but live is another story. They need to just make a new WoW game instead of making more expansions at this point. Live is so screwed up now because we are on our 7th expansion. The entire game needs to be reworked from top to bottom in order for it to become organized again from leveling, gear, raids, items, zones, quest lines and reputation. It would be easier to just build a new game at this point and people would definitely come back to play a new game instead of another expansion.
---
&gt; stay in retail
---
Retail sucks for a multitude of reasons. There's no way to make it enjoyable again for me.
---
Kazzak kamikazing was def gireving on my server.
---
Because you are a dumb
---
yeh they definetly are and why wouldnt they, every single person i know who is planning on playing classic is already in a pre organised guild.
---
&gt;The OP of this chain implied that WoW(pvp) vanilla is rock&gt;scissors. Way to miss the point I guess?
---
Just your Dota example. I know this might be a difficult concept for you, but it's called 'inference'. OP was referring to balance in the form that you get in retail. The Rock/Paper/Scissors doesn't necessarily imply a good, or any, balance. Some would say that RPS is unbalanced, but still fun. 
---
&gt; No, that is one way of balancing the game. And there are many things to be equal at, so there will be inequalities in other areas.  
---
Perfect equality cannot be achieved, thus many different ways to balance, like utility. 
---
Right. Which is where the Rock Paper Scissors comes in. Balance is subjective. You need context for any given argument/statement about it. 
---
&gt; Yea because blizzard's shit "balancing" and dev's warrior favoritism. 
---
Lol. Why you so mad? This doesn't even have anything to do with anything though.
---
&gt; Maybe on your shitty private server. 
---
And the, I would assume you think, insults. Petty. I've never played a Pserver, but you've clearly never played end game Vanilla. 
---
&gt; Lmao what? How can that be subjective? You are literally battling against shitty AI for 99% of your leveling, 100% of dungeons and raids. Just because you can do some PVP inbetween doesn't mean those are not PVE activities. 
---
You can level in BG's. You don't have to PvE at all. Some people never raid. 
---
&gt; It cannot be half the game when there is no content equal to that. **It can be a whole game to someone, and none to other.** But content wise its one tenth, if even that. If it was such a huge part of the game, there would be more content for it. But there isn't.  
---
Even today you have like 20 battlegrounds + 20 arenas vs hundreds of dungeons and hundreds of raids. And those bgs and arenas are mostly just terrain, no scripting required. So even the amount of work put into PVP is less than that tenth. 
---
That's the only part that matters. The amount of, or the time required to create, content has nothing to do with how popular it is or how often it gets utilized.
---
&gt; No. It doesn't. Warcraft was always about faction warfare. Its completely normal to have PVP servers as a base. That doesn't mean its half the game. They wanted players to WPVP because its more stuff to do. 
---
The point was they planned to only have PvP servers. "... as a base". As in, the core of the game.
---
&gt; They were definitely not built around the idea of PVP when the whole game revolves around PVE. They were built in mind that PVP will exist, but thats the extent of it. 
---
Okay...
---
&gt; That is just very ignorant and arrogant to say. Nowhere near do people play PVP as much as they play PVP. If people PVPed more, blizzard would offer way more PVP content.  
---
So you're just wrong on that. It might be the case for you, but you're minority.  
---
Its a PVE game. Go play some FPS or MOBAs if you want PVP game. 
---
Nah, only PVP servers indicates that it was meant to be a PVP game. They didn't add PvE servers until people said they wanted it and the money started rolling in. 
---
The entire game, outside of instances, *is* PVP content. 
---
&gt; \-Run to portal to Q for game  
---
\-Run to battlemaster to Q for game  
---
same thing, you're just too much of a dum dum to comprehend. Just because 1 of them is located in more accessable area doesn't mean they are not the same thing. 
---
And more petty insults.
---
It's not the same thing. That's why they added them in the first place. So people could stay in the main city and keep doing stuff like Tradeskills/AH while queueing. The battlemasters being more accessible is their entire point and is the difference. 
---
&gt; Reading comprehension my dude. Try reading again. I was talking about BG masters, which are the same thing as portals anyway.  
---
(now you go on to talk about how BGportals/masters work even tho you have zero correlation or reading comprehension skills, lmao) 
---
But they aren't the same. Which is the entire point of Battlemasters existing. Do they work the same as a portal in function? Yes. Are they located in cities instead of out in the world? Yes. That's their entire point and the difference. 
---
&gt; This is akin to calling someone name and ignoring them. You are one giant puss if you mainly play PVP let me tell you that.  
---
**A sore loser that cannot accept defeat.**  
---
No need to reply, we both know you're just wrong : 
---
Rofl. Says the guy whose only argument is 'Nuh uh! You're a do-do head!". Grow up.
---
The problem is that maintaining at least 40 man roster that would be up for HC version and that wouldn't suck would be almost impossible. Maintaining currently 24-25 man roster in order to clear mythic raids - for most of the guilds - is impossible because people either don't adapt well, suck or just leave because of irl reasons. I mean of course HC would be -probably- easier than current mythics but still 40 people on +/- same level of skill, determination and availablity would be almost impossible.
---
BFA was just a recipe for disaster. Old ass game thats gone through many personnel changes that had gone through multiple expansions that just stacked problem onto problem onto problem
---
Where you afk and left something on your keyboard to spam frostbolt? Hard to tell from video since you only cast frostbolt
---
Prot paladin got greatly buffed in tbc and onwards. 
---
In vanilla you face potential threat issues, mana issues, and have no taunt. You can make it work in dungeons, and it's fine while leveling, but most guilds won't be interested in a prot paladin for raiding.
---
Like 99% of raiding guilds won’t be premade. 
---
People would be pretty crazy to set up a raid team before the game even launches. You have no idea who’s even gonna make it past level 20, let alone make it to 60 and have the gear to raid.
---
orc warlock is fucking GOD TIER compared to undead though, that stun resist is absurd
---
Let me just make a list of every generic comment:
---
1. Cant log in
---
2. Still cant log
---
3. Blizz loves streamers more
---
4. I love X streamer
---
5. I hate y streamer
---
6. This game is great. Much nostalgia. 
---
7. This game is too slow for the first 5 levels 
---
8. Stop complaining. This is a stress test and not a demo.
---
Dont loot the slimes
---
I really don't have an issue with the numbers as they've been.
---
 [https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/pdt](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/pdt)
---
We will be allowing feral druids to raid starting in AQ40. (playing Horde)
---
You think you do but you don’t. After naxx comes TBC. Nothing else.
---
Did the bad Paladin lay his hand on you?
---
Night Elf Animations are pretty awesome.
---
Classic should stay Classic. No additions.
---
I think there will be a proportion of premade type guilds but the vast majority of the population will only start thinking about this type of thing in the first couple of weeks. Plus nothing to say that people who think they will raid will necessarily even reach 60. There will be non stop spam for guild recruiting I’m sure
---
I believe the majority of us knows exactly what are we getting into with Classic
---
Hell yeah totally pro-sub, I also like your idea of making a regionally based sub. But unfortunately that is a lot of work for less money, so I doubt this will ever happen in reality. Certainly a nice sentiment though!
---
I have a feeling you're spot on.
---
&gt;marketing value of "we're listing, #nochanges, we swear" is too strong 
---
Exactly, but we know that they ARE open to community input. It's almost like they have to wait for us to make the suggestion to employ the change, otherwise the 'no changes' zealots would scream about it loudly enough that it'll be lost to pack mentality.
---
This is not how macros work on retail, and I think they're using retail macros for classic, so I don't think you'll need 2 button presses in classic.
---
1. Blackrock Mountain (Burning Steppes / Searing Gorge) for the PVP and Raids.
---
2. Stranglethorn Vale (Fishing contest, Arena, and ZG)
---
3. Un'goro Crater (really fun leveling zone where most people hit 60, Devilsaurs were the original "oh shit, better steer clear" monsters)
---
4. Winterspring (lots of good quests and a beautiful zone)
---
5. Silithus (both pre-AQ because it was fun to explore and speculate and after-AQ because it's where everyone was).
---
As someone who played a hybrid in Vanilla I just don’t see why people would want to pick a role for a class that is leaps and bounds worse than other options. At the time sure. I always wanted paladins to have other options as a hybrid rather than just heal. When BC hit I got to do that. I MTed almost every boss in almost every expansion as a paladin. Even played Ret from time to time. 
---
Classic is not going to get class improvements to hybrid classes alt specs. At least I hope not. #NoChanges 
---
All that being said while I plan on letting hybrids raid as DPS/maybe OT I don’t plan on having more than 1 of each in a raid. SPriest, Ret, Feral one slot for each. If you are not “The Guy” you’re healing. 
---
Got to have a Team mentality in Classic.
---
Go play retail then.
---
Yes. It's not open yet.
---
 Something beautiful? 😊
---
an esfand revelation
---
Transmog would totally change the economy and make low level greens really expensive, impacting the nooby/low level players.  Also  you wouldn't know whether to pick a fight or not in wpvp
---
Hey all.
---
I've read plenty of posts about how Paladins aren't very good tanks, and then a few saying how they're ok...
---
At what point do Paladin tanks become irrelevant? Will I inevitably end up healing once I hit 60? And, if anyone is well versed on Paladin tanks, what is their best way to keep aggro?
---
I'm considering it mainly because I'd like to main a shield-user, and mained a warrior tank when I first played (TBC at the age of 13!) so would like to mix it up ideally.
---
Have to play Suikoden 2 again after seeing this
---
&gt; You arent going to be stepping into AQ40/Naxx before you've gone through Dungeons, MC and BWL.
---
Uhm, Zul'gurub was made as a catch-up raid. AQ is skippable for my class so I can definitely go into Naxx without doing it.
---
Assuming my guild is doing Naxx I can go straight from lvl 60 items to BWL to Naxx.
---
I'm going to advocate that Guild Banks be included in Classic WoW because it will make the game better, and that's the environment I want to play in.
---
Agreed - My contribution to the guild banking network was an orc warrior named WardBijou. I stored, sorted and organized all the bijous/coins from ZG and all the similar mats (idols I think) from AQ20. It was great being asked every 3 minutes to see if I had any of x bijou...
---
No, but OP is choosing his rogue based on the Gouge animation.
---
I'm going Female Orc rogue. Best PVE racial, a more consistent PVP racial against harder 1v1 classes that can't be replaced by a trinket, and they look the best of all the Horde rogues.
---
Multiboxing?
---
There's PLENTY to do while waiting for raids. There's still professions, reps, mounts, recipes, companion pets, titles and plenty of other things to grind. Even if you had everything that you wanted, you could still craft for profit to kill time while waiting for raids.   
---
There's also the fact that many people want to return to Vanilla not for the gear treadmill, but for the community, the experience, the world pvp. Retail is a better fit for people who don't want to do anything other than grind gear.
---
If I recall correctly, that helm could be used to CC one of General Drakk’s two adds in UBRS. CC one at start for 30 seconds and burn the other while hunter kites Drakk, break the CC and kill the second, and wait for Drakk to return. Should still be a viable strat to help with early UBRS runs.
---
It's in 1 hour 40 minutes from this post.
---
Did they change the realm from PvP to normal?
---
&gt; while enjoying WoW Classic in moderation.
---
Wrong audience for that lol
---
1. Duskwood  
---
2. Plaguelands  
---
3. Silverpine  
---
4. Westfall  
---
Only 4 because both Plaguelands are ex-aequo on 2 taking 2 spots.
---
I dislike this mindset. Is vanilla great? Yes. Are most things better in vanilla? Yes. But are thing's good by virtue of being in vanilla? No.
---
I'm willing to be persuaded on either side of the guild bank proposition, but please use actual reasons for it's inclusion or non-inclusion, not "it wasn't in vanilla" or "anything not in vanilla is bad". This goes for everything else as well.
---
4 str 4 stam leather belt.
---
"You have already taken this survey."
---
There are far too many specs completely irrelevant for it to be a "complete" game, tbh.
---
There's no NA or EU client. You just select region/account on you in you wow bnet launcher and select the stress test/beta server. If there's none, sadly you weren't invited :/ I got my stress test email a day after I actually got it in the launcher.
---
31
---
You cant buy the WoW tokens with Classic Gold, so the Boosters will want Retail gold, because then they can trade it in for Battle.net Currency.
---
Checks out.
---
Jesus people, just download a private server if your itch is really that bad and you don't think that you'll burn yourselves out.
---
They ruined retail, and now when there is nothing more to ruin they have to move something else and repeat the cycle.
---
As everyone has said for the last 6 months, no you can't frontstab or /sit talents.
---
I think Guild Banks and revised item stacking are fine and should be implemented. The support team will not want to deal with the backlash when a disgruntled Guildmaster empties the guild bank and moves to another server (this happened back in the day).
---
People forget how bad item stacks were in Vanilla as well. Try farming anything that only stacks to 10 and realizing your out of bag space in minutes. Like the key-ring (implemented during 1.11), certain QoL improvements are inevitable, even if they are not put in day one of Classic.
---
Vanilla had way too many gray trash loot items that clogged your bags as well. I'm glad they removed a lot of these junk items in later expansions.
---
This, the best I'd hope for if I were trying to organize a guild at this point is perhaps the foundation for a few core members, the beginnings of some class synergy, and stuff like that. With 3 months left there are far too many variables remaining. Friends of applicants could decide to play, people may disagree on which faction to roll, lots could happen.
---
Smug? Look at everyone replying to me. Don’t act like having a different opinion gets welcomed with open arms. 
---
I’m sorry to hear about your friends but this is what makes me scratch my head. The fact that you think your friends quitting retail is proof that the game is bad.
---
Play on a private server for free, my guy.
---
Specifically to benefit your tanking? BOP resist chest plate. Might be a few others. 
---
For money making there are a few. Like the Lionheart helm when it is released. 
---
Armor smithing doesn't offer as much for tanking as engineering, but it is the only other profession that offers any direct BOP items that would be of some use.
---
It won't even matter if the community wants it. Blizzard is not going to bring back a system that was rife with abuse, required GM tickets, and was a violation of the ToS. They've already shown they will be implementing features that reduce the need for GMs, such as loot sharing in raids.
---
Is it a meme or is it not? I just want to be corrected and I am getting different answers.
---
Sounds fun
---
Look man, the simple truth is that after Naxx has been done for a long time, people will leave unless *something* is done. Be it a seasonal thing with resets, moving on to TBC, or adding content to Classic, something will happen.
---
You're not going to get hundreds of thousands of people playing 1.12 stuck at Naxx for 5 years. Pick your poison. Blizzard knows this and will act accordingly.
---
Anecdotally I did 12 and it was one of the most exciting times of my life.
---
I didn't think I wanted it, but I did.
---
I never had an interest in Private servers, but over time it's just grown and grown and now I'm incredibly excited to play in August.
---
Human:
---
More weapon skill = more damage = more threat generated = better ability to hold aggro = more raid dps = easier and faster clears.
---
NE:
---
Some more nature resist and a 1% to dodge a single attack. (1% to be overpowered by another warrior in pvp)
---
TLDR: Human is better, but roll whatever you want I'm not a cop. :)
---
I came back to play WoW about 2 months ago after being AFK for nearly 8 years. Unlike many, I actually enjoy BfA quite a bit.
---
Same question back at you. Why are you so adamant against them?
---
We might get them.
---
I’m sure all the addons will have classic versions but I plan to use as few as possible to get a closer to classic experience.
---
Woah woah wtf i thought it was 4pm - 6pm again
---
It means, compared to retail, you can share mounts you earn, if you unlock flying on your main you can use it on your alts. Catching up in raiding is easier in retail and to get full epics. All of this, rep rewards, epic gear, raiding is too time consuming to make alts in Classic. I raided on my hunter for 3-4 months in Vanilla and I was still missing 8 epic pieces and did not complete my tier 1. When the raid boss drops 3 epics per 40 people, it can take a very long time to gear up and having to do it again on an alt seems daunting. Furthermore, you would still have to complete ALL the attunement quests again, farm resist gear again, aq rep again and so on.
---
I am a beta vanilla player, I want classic as much as anyone here. That doesn't mean that we can't daydream about what WoW could/could've been had they not completely lost track of the things that made vanilla enjoyable.
---
No, but you don't need to have true vanilla experience to make a meme. Jesus christ...
---
This isn’t a bad solution though. It solves all the primary problems that rise during a launch. If anything, this is a great solution. People are just hung-up about it because it isn’t a perfect solution. Like I’d rather not get upset over something that isn’t perfectly the way I want it. I mean I don’t have the technical knowledge and developer skills to implement a perfect solution if I was given one, but I can’t even CONCEPTUALIZE a solution that satisfies your demands while also satisfying the technical demands of a launch. Would you even want a launch where there’s hundreds of people vying over a single mob when leveling?
---
It changes it to a mailbox system rather than a teleporter

Results of Survey - https://www.surveymonkey.com/survey-taken/
---
Well normaly you get 2 Extra Attack from the WF proc and after that a 3Sec GCD. But what ppl told me is that the 2 extra attack is seperated in 2 swings.. so 1 swing each 1 extra attack. This makes the class so totally unplayable
---
Dwarfs are the only redeemable Alliance race in my opinion! If I HAD to play on Alliance for whatever reason that's what I'd roll, but I don't so Horde forever. Lok'tar!

I hear you but I'm talking more like while running Deadmines saying something like "Hey this Paladin is having a hard time holding aggro let's give him like 5 seconds before we attack." And then that just never happens.
---
Agreed. I hate level scaling. Any Elder Scrolls game would of been so dope if increasing your skills actually mattered. What's the point in increasing your skills if what you're fighting just scales in difficulty with you lol.
---
Some people are assholes, others are not. When you get into a group let them know that you have never played Classic or your class and you are learning. Chances are they will be fine with it and help you along. Dont be afraid to ask questions in general chat. If it's Barrens chat you may have a slightly difficult time finding a serious answer but there will be someone willing to help.
---
Nope, it was never possible in 19s.
---
Source: I played level 19 twinks way too much.
---
I have the same feelings, leaning maybe slightly more towards delightful
---
Wait how is it Asmong’s trinket if he didn’t loot it?
---
I mean it is in PvE until AQ, and even then it's only good for pvp.
---
Everyone's cool with layering though. No one's throwing fits over the advanced mailbox. So it clearly isn't this black and white.
---
I’m going to have to say that is not the norm.  Unless you have a core group that you actually know irl or played with for a while, there are going to be a ton of changes from now until the first raid.   Most guilds will be filling their rosters up until the day of their first raid.
---
Don’t worry about it lol
---
&gt; The only people who use the word "science" are non scientists.
---
As a scientist, that I can say that this is not true
---
I made a basic auto shot timer and some other things for fun on the Classic beta.  It should be good enough to hold you over until some more committed addon developers either port or make a better one:
---
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dvl-6qP4y27QE1lhPefnrD1gGxkRQdAx
---
One thing I noticed is the 0.5 sec cast time of Auto Shot isn't static.  It seems to vary probably due to latency and batching (seems to vary around +/- 0.25 sec), but also haste buffs like Quick Shots seem to reduce it (consistently shorter time when Quick Shots is active).  I'm not accounting for that in my addon, I fixed it to 0.5 sec.  You can test the cast time if you want by uncommenting line 118 (remove the -- at the start) in autoshottimer.lua.
---
ah yes the free for all chest that is now reserved
---
Nah, I'd rather have the Classic gold. That shit's gonna be expensive simply because there are no tokens. $15 a month is nothing, that won't even buy 500g in Classic. WoW Classic raids could cost up to $400 or 4000g, depending on which "per hour" metric you use ($10/hr or 100g/hr). And that's just for the ones that can be done in less than an hour. The Scarab Lord mount should cost somewhere around $10,000 if a good bidding war started, but definitely no less than $6,000.
---
it was, but the slower weaps still have higher dmg so every instant has that much extra damage, it just no longer has a better multiplier for AP contributions.  
---
So it still matters, just not as much as before.  
---
Pre normalization it was axe no question, post normalization its become a debatable issue for humans because the weapon skill is more or less comparable to the extra dmg from the slower weap.
---
1. Barrens.
---
2. Arathi. I hit level 40 killing ogres in Stromgarde.
---
3. Thousand Needles. Except for that slow-assed Tauren escort quest.
---
4. Tanaris. I like open areas, sue me.
---
5. Plaguelands. Atmosphere in spades.
---
YOU TAKE THAT BACK! no Heroic modes. Since Nax was Extremely hard back in the day barley no one cleared it why the re rleased it in WOTLK. Since this time round players are a lot better than your typical keyboard turning i have hope that people will clear it a bit more. 
---
With that being said.. If 80% of the Population does nax and has all the teir gear.  do BC, Since BC was an actual Extension of Vanilla. but now we are talking what 5 years ahead now?
---
Naaah just a slow plod with two toons on one account. My Warlock will be my main who will probably be a consistent 15-20 levels up but yeah I've always played this way.
---
Don't give a shit about being on the bleeding edge.
---
next week is my turn to repost this
---
If it's red it's dead.
---
It seems like they could have added an “at 60” to the end of it and just used crit rating behind the scenes.
---
The video is from WotLK. It does not work like in the video no.
---
Atm i am not a fan of the idea. If harder raid difficulty would be added however i could accept it only if loot wouldn't get more powerful. Maybe change the looks of gear that people could show off.
---
Happy Cakeday! Pls 1g?
---
It's about the weapon damage. and skills that deal % of weapon damage. For a weapon with the same DPS: Slower speed = higher top end damage. Faster weapon = lower top end dmg
---
Good on Turley. I'm not down for Ninja-Looters, but god do I despise the culture of people helping streamers to get whatever they want. High five, Mr. Turley. You did a dirty thing, and I enjoyed watching it's effect.
---
Memes are jokes... you post a joke. but you cannot take one?
---
Oh yes, we raided a lot with the RSA! Good to see people are still around :-)
---
I'm going to advocate for heirloom gear because it made the game better as you don't need to compete for kills or grind other gear to do something.   /s
---
He didn't even bless me with protection
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
&gt;No Gatekeeping. _Don't tell people to "play Retail/Private Servers",_ or that Classic is not for them, or any variant thereof in order to dismiss their viewpoint. Regardless of your personal disagreement with them or their opinions, this is not necessary. We are here because of a shared love of the game, not to gatekeep who is allowed to play it.
---
Reported.
---
You really are the worst bot.
---
As user CarrieMH687 once said:
---
&gt; Why do you waste your time doing this
---
*I'm a human being too, And this action was performed manually. /s*
---
I would buy 5x 6 month subs if it meant I could get into beta.  I want to get completely set up before it begins.
---
The quest line for Linken's sword of Mastery and Linken's Boomerang.
---
What
---
How do they make the new content relevant, while keeping the old content relevant as well?
---
And then maybe they can add transmog too, it'll make the game better!
---
Oh and maybe rebalance some of the more useless specs, that'll make the game better too!
---
Also I hate waiting to form groups, some sort of automated group finder system would definitely make the game better!
---
Die, respawn, play the game.
---
It’s wrath where it started getting out of hand but was manageable because it had just started the issue. iLvl jumps and number of tiers had started spiraling. The health difference between a fresh 80 and an ICC geared 80 was intense.
---
There's people at least saying "the only bugs remaining are minor, why are they waiting another 3 months to release it".  
---
Can't make everyone happy.
---
I see. Unwillingness to learn is bad. I guess o e has to suck it up or leave the party? I know no other way. Besides cool groups outweigh bad experiences imo.
---
Curl up in a ball and cry.  Log off until he goes offline.
---
All honesty Depends on the rogue.
---
warrior your most likely fucked... Druid iff you are good you will get away. Warlock you would be fine. Priest maybe Hunter Kite for dayzzzzzz Pally your dead unless bubble hearth.
---
Can confirm you're correct. Coming from a dude on classic beta that went to crossroads then flew to org without ever visiting org
---
I'm no dentist, but perhaps there are things that can't be changed past a certain age. I really have no clue though
---
Ammo is not limited to quivers/ammo bags alone. You can always ask another player to hold some for you also. I remember when I tanked I'd sometimes give hunters some ammo and leave myself like 50 or so for pulls.
---
Yeah you can easily level together. If you choose a class humans dont have just know you will probably have to run back to your starting area to pick up the first few class quest.
---
Also Dwarf and Gnome start in the same area and I think Humans can be any class that they can so it should work out fine.
---
I'm advocating for Guild Banks because it increases the amount of guild cohesion and puts into place a system that can benefit and reward guild members. As a strong focus on community with a quality of life easement is an acceptable deviation from Classic. Which did not have the system due to time and technology constraints.
---
Sounds a little bit better than your bullshit.
---
I’m looking forward to actually feeling more powerful when I level. It sucks when you don’t and nothing changes because all the mobs just leveled with you.
---
Take your L then continue lvling
---
How many bubbles do you think Paladin's have?
---
This is awesome, I've been working on bringing Cryolysis up to date for classic, which is basically just a fork of Necrosis for mages. It's a nice to have a reference to your github for some similar issues that came up, thanks!
---
They are? I hope not tbh, internal server rivalry is a big thing to me.
---
Being able to count how much hp or int etc youll get will be awesome. Like 1 stam = 10hp right? So if you get an item your gonna know exactly how much that item will improve you.
---
All of those things are true.
---
It was called Wrath of the Lich King and it was the greatest expansion.
---
I am really sorry to hear that.
---
Without the cloth turn ins I do not believe exalted is achievable by 40. I do not know if the cloth turn ins will be in game at launch or not.   
---
Edit: and as others have said the cloth won't help you at 40.
---
thank you sir. i feel the same way
---
toolchest won't be that hard ish? I guess if you start having 10+ people need it then you'll start waiting a few minutes but that'd probably be iffy
---
While I would like heroic versions of raids or 5 mans in Vanilla. I would prefer they not do anything and just release TBC servers. Don’t add anything at all to classic. It’s classic. Leave it be.
---
I bet you 95% of guild banks were essentially giant account/character wide alt banks. One of many steps on the path to account-wide progression rather than focus on characters.
---
I know because this was me and all my alts in BC/Wrath. And don't pretend like you didn't do the same thing.
---
Organizing and handling guild assets was one of the challenges of running a guild. Having an officer in charge of handling and distributing guild assets is another one of the roles involved in running a guild and we need those roles. Let's just stick with no changes so we don't get any butterfly effects okay?
---
Vermintide 2 on max settings looks pretty damn close enough, also why would it need hundreds of players in one spot, they can just make phasing
---
Nothing really exciting happens to watch during raid bosses really. Most DPS/Tanks are focused on their cool downs/rotations/positioning/threat/boss mechanics to so they dont really see much either.
---
As a healer you are trading that for health bars of your assignment + tanks for emergency heals/cool downs/positioning/mana efficiency (down ranking/trying not to overheal)/cleansing/mana regain (5 second rule)/Innervate and rebirth calls if druid
---
I had the most fun in Vanilla/TBC healing, though went hunter in TBC as my main rather then my priest.
---
That’s to much, a random DC or irl problem would ruin the whole day. Middle ground is needed
---
Lol right?
---
...I think you may actually agree with everything /u/Muesli_nom said, with the added caveat that you can play braindead and still have a great time.
---
But how do you sit?
---
You die. No ganking rogue waits until you're ready. We'll wait until you've pulled a couple mobs or are low on health.
---
Since it became mainstream dude,  the same people who said no to classic servers are now the majority,  screaming with streamers.
---
Shows for me now. So if it doesn't show by now there might be something wrong.
---
e. and I just realized it shows the server type as "Normal" instead of "PvP".
---
spooky big numbers. 
---
D3 is fine, unlike retail WoW, the loot drop/gameplay is proportional to its inflated numbers.
---
In the options its possible to condense the number that pops up on your screen to be like any incremental/idle game out there. 
---
    1,000,000,000,000 -&gt; 1,000 B
---
two level 10's coming right up
---
&gt; We'll wait until you've pulled a couple mobs ~~or~~*and* are low on health.
---
The only titles available are the PvP titles.
---
what level do locks get deathcoil i think its much later yeah? oh sac voidwalker really you want to counter with a stun or some sort of interupt thats instant 
---
chances are if they get the jump you are done unless you can break their rotation and take control
---
i guess a mage would be nova blink and decide from there to sheep and run or fight
---
So... there is a video from the beta where if you are sitting and stand at the exactly right moment you can proc talents from the sit crit. It was on the sub earlier today. I'll see if I can find it.
---
For people who make alts that would be same role/gear, how do you decide on professions? 
---
For example since I can't decide on a druid or shaman I will most likely level both. For druid I'd go Herb/Alch, but then what should I do for the Shaman? I'm not considering Engineering, cause Shamen don't insult the Elements by using bombs and mech chickens. Would Skinning/LW make sense? Thing is Shaman is not the best grinder, especially since I'll most likely be healing, so it seems I'll be beaten by all the rogues and hunters who can farm better than me. Thoughts?
---
Not who you responded to, but what does that have to do with this discussion? Even if they didn't originally play in vanilla, this is about dev philosophy on fixing bugs from the original game. The gatekeeping and elitism around playing original vanilla is what makes this sub so miserable most of the time.
---
On topic, there is a precedent of fixing some bugs from original vanilla in the beta so far, but I personally think this one should stay. It's not like paladins were incredibly busted or anything without this and giving them a weird mechanic to keep up with other classes seems fine to me.
---
streamers who extol the virtues of vanilla are so full of shit considering they have the entire game handed to them on a silver platter
---
god im so happy im smarter and have a better computer to run classic and admire everything it gave me at 14. now 27.
---
Yes because NElfs have the dumbest stance with a shield.
---
The whole class spec of shadow is, someone should link that forum post xD good times
---
numbers be like that.
---
You mean every other day.  Nd multiple times a day if you count comments linking to it.
---
Of course, it was designed this way
---
i was so sad when i logged into my level 72 and tried to look at the talent tree. they've turned the game into a social media cashgrab app.
---
I remember having my mind blown the first time I saw someone's health abbreviated to 100k. Think it was a bear druid in ICC with the 30% buff popping cd's. It was really surreal and at the time I thought it was cool as shit and wanted my dk to be able to break into 100k territory. Now I just miss seeing all the digits of someone's health .
---
In detail: if you had a quiver equipped, and melee’d a mob, your auto shot would be disabled from then on unless you relogged. You could still use ranged abilities (like Arcane shot), but you wouldn’t fire auto shots. 
---
Relogging only fixed the issue until you melee’d again, so it wasn’t a feasible fix for most people. Can you imagine logging out every time a mob passed into your dead zone? Nightmare. I just sold my quiver for the time being, replaced it with a bag, and then kept my arrows there instead. Our DPS has suffered tho, since quivers etc. give a 10% bonus to damage.
---
I believe I recall in the Classicast Interview with John Staats and Mark Kern (#13) that the cap was 3k? I believe Mark Kern said they had the ability to cap it at 4.5k but the lead guy (blanking on his name) intentionally capped it lower at 3k because he felt it would be important for server communities to keep it at that lower number.
---
I saw a clip of it a while back so I don't remember where it is in the interview? Maybe 2 hours'sh?
---
Oof. Not doing it during prime time?
---
On private servers, alliance warlocks were very rare, and very sought after for fights with lots of banishes. On Classic, no one can predict exactly what the class spread is going to be. I expect the population in general won't lean so hard into the warrior/mage/rogue/priest meta. That being said I don't think you will have a hard time finding a raid slot. Getting into 5mans as a dps is generally a bit of a fucker tho.
---
Ye, im planning to get all the stuff i want done around the house now so i can have weekends to just dick off.  Going to be a long grind ahead
---

Rogue with the jump: Cheap shot, Skill, Skill, Kidney shot for 4 seconds, skill, skill
---
Any class: Dead
---
Yeah, most guilds- even if they were doing Naxx up to a certain point- never finished AQ. Hardly anyone beat C'thun and Vicidus. I remember doing AQ in green nature resist gear. Didn't need good gear for some fights... literally just had to make sure the nature damage didn't do anything to you. Took forever to find the right pieces. Then AQ was mostly forgotten when Naxx hit, and even fewer people finished Naxx before TBC. The release of the later vanilla content and TBC was very poorly planned.
---
# What
---
Slippery Slope Fallacy. Look it up.
---
There’s guides to do 1-5 by exploration. If every layer is a shitshow on launch day, that will be the best way to get to 5. You get a ton of flight paths too. 
---
If you can do 1-5 quickly, you are better off to just quest in the main part of the zone (kharanos, etc). And this is where grouping with some friends is nice because the mobs are a lot more dangerous than coldridge valley. 
---
For 10+, I prefer loch &gt; darkshore &gt; loch again &gt; darkshore again &gt; ashenvale. 
---
I always try to avoid human zones because they are so overpopulated, and at the same time pretty hard (defias pillager says hi). 
---
Things almost always go sideways if you try excessively hard to optimize your leveling though, and there will be people who are so fast that it’s discouraging, so don’t get too hung up about this kind of stuff. But it is a lot of fun to plan out :D
---
What is dead may never die.

#Goal - wPvP Battles
---
###Ideal Classes -
---
- Mage
---
- Rogue
---
- Warlock
---
- Warrior
---
- Priest
---
**1) Mage**
---
*As a mage I like the idea of being able to control large scale battles with AoE and CC. The PoM Pyro build looks like a lot of fun but I don't like being CD reliant.*
---
**2) Rogue**
---
*As a rogue I like the idea of being able to choose my fights. They are pretty well-known as the kings of wPvP but they are pretty CD reliant, and I don't like that. In group fights, other classes might be a better choice.*
---
**3) Warlock**
---
*As a Warlock I like the idea of PvE/PvP basically sharing the same gearset. They're dots are very strong and from what I can tell, they are fun to play in BGs. Shards though... I don't like that...*
---
**4) Warrior**
---
*As a warrior I like the idea of being a wrecking ball with a pocket healer. It's a great class choice for leaders and for BGs, overall an excellent choice for a player interested in PvP. But, stance dancing, is it really that bad if I plan to PvP pretty seriously?*
---
**5) Priest**
---
*As a priest I like idea of being able to offspec heal to 60. I do enjoy healing so I don't mind being pressured into healing even at 60, but I'm wondering, which tier set does the blue PvP set compare with? Also, in wPvP, will I really be OOM after my first fight?*
---
###*I want to play a class that is a monster 1v1, but can also maintain a pretty high damage output in group battles. I plan on leading a guild of work mates and friends, so being on the front lines is important.*
---
why not female elves? D:
---
Warriors will be populated but none of them will want to tank, so you're fine
---
There were a few games for me that I had a lot more fun group pvping in, WAR especially, but WoW is the only game to have successfully created a world I wanted to be a part of and meet people in. The dungeoning is sooo good, every loot upgrade feels like such a big deal because the game is so inherently challenging. 
---
What’s really cool about WoW for me is that while you are leveling up from 1-60 in groups and with friends, you struggle, but once you’re finally 60 and you start getting some gear the entire world that was once incredibly challenging becomes yours to explore on own if you want. You save for you epic mount and you can finally outrun mobs that have been destroying you for your entire experience. You can farm a little easier, explore a little more, get away with riskier world pvp and overall the game just becomes MORE expansive as you level instead of the same.
---
Retail WoW has the same experience with the world from 110-120 for the most part. Mobs are about the same difficulty (in some cases harder if you were really well geared in legion) and you can go wherever you want. 
---
Having hard restrictions in a game is the best way to get people to strive to get better. My favorite example of this is the Dark Souls games. That game for whatever reason was the closest feeling to playing classic wow I’ve had in a long time and I couldn’t even tell you why.
---
I’m beyond excited for the rerelease of classic and honestly worried for my health when it releases 😂
---
Make an orc or troll, go to the southwest corner of the valley of trials and jump into the water. Cross to ratchet. You now have access to a bank, and a flightpath to org.
---
Oh GOD no let me login ! I can’t feel me legs!
---
I liked all of them. But I was a big dbz fan, so my opinion is biased.
---
Yeah, if you used the gear to get better gear then it wasn't made irrelevant.
---
TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL!!!
---
Assuming they are in, A Donation of Mageweave requires level 40.  You can only do it once, and then A Donation of Runecloth is available at 50, and is repeatable as Additional Runecloth.  So cloth won't do the trick at 40.
---
Any guild worth its salt does not lock itself in to any player beyond core leadership. If a better more dedicated player shows up, they'll be wanted. Especially if they're well liked and fun to play with.
---
The community is what you make it.  No more no less.
---
Saitama would knock Goku back into 1989.
---
Edit: The simplest DBZ fan troll works 100% of the time.
---
Not logging, but that southern place in the barrens, they fuckin up our land
---
I think you're right.
---
Explains insults of "Go back to private servers" being thrown around when people suggest something isn't quite vanilla-like with the beta
---
Until you have to spend all your money on skills or better yet have to decide which skill to take until you can get some more cash.
---
Ideally they start working on their pre-raid* BiS so they're more useful. MC isn't difficult, but obviously it's easier the better gear you have. On that note, farming gold for consumables would be nice as well. Also working on some fire resist gear. Working on Hydraxian rep would be nice so you can start dousing flames and actually get to Rag.
---
A big thing is getting as many UBRS keys in the guild as possible, which means a lot of LBRS runs. UBRS contains a ton of pre-raid BiS items for many classes so it's good to have as many people as possible that can open the damn door.
---
i think he's trying to avoid the asmongold clips, not seek them out lol
---
Just logged on and can see the server, though it's not up, and it shows I have two characters there (which was the number I created on the last one), so I guess we can continue with those.
---
It depends on the guild. If a guild requires people to farm and they don’t, let them go from the guild.
---
A priest shouldn't die to a rogue while leveling. Shield, Psychic scream, vampiric embrace, dot burn and kite while reapplying shield and you should be fine.
---
Any tips or links to videos for damage rotations for PvE/PvP enhancement? Planning on maining Shaman, which is a class I've never touched.
---
Thanks for this post. Definitely needed to be said.
---
There isn't a ceiling, but there is a plateau. 
---
If you play for the leader boards then you'd realize that no one really plays because of its damage values. Its more of a demon-slaying time trial game.
---
Once you see friendship, community, and general hard work... it just happens.
---
People help each other out more. 
---
I still remember my vanilla friends and experiences. I dont remember anyone, or even worked on a guild since post wotlk.
---
Doesn't matter. It won't happen. Keep wasting your time tho.
---
So mages won't be that good until late game? I thought they were a class that did well even with rubbish gear
---
Why undead? Tauren seems like the best choice because of how close the mailbox is to the bank and auction house .
---
Really? I could have sworn that I used to do stuff like this when I played in Vanilla/TBC.  Maybe i'm mistaken. Thanks!
---
Well yes because you can't reach infinity. Diablo has season where you are just competing with others on the leader-boards and the highest is a solo 129 greater rift currently. If you like competing then you still need the best in slot gear and to be mechanically good at the game to climb the ladder.
---
As Warrior get backpedaled to death
---
As Rogue git gud git better
---
As Hunter get deadzoned to death
---
As Mage frost nova and kill him
---
As Druid travel form and run away
---
As Warlock sacrifice, dot and kite 
---
As Shaman spam Frost shock and kite
---
As Paladin Bubble and Hearthstone
---
As Priest Shield, dot and kite
---
Which is the reason they took DAE off the default subs.
---
I don't have a drinking problem, I drink, I get drunk, I fall down, no problem!
---
Never played Legion either, friend. You seem strangely combative. Enjoy your day.
---
Link the survey code. 
---
You are linking survey-taken, which is linked to your login.
---
The basis of your opinion is believing that current retail wow isnt effectively dead and hated.
---
It is, you need to come to terms with that
---
Well, seeing as I have been recruiting and you haven't I don't think you're really in a position to be making comments like that. I'm currently at 24 with 3 months to go till launch.
---
Searching -something on youtube makes it where the search results do not include it. Try it.
---
Gathering professions might be profitable after a couple months. More gold needs to be in the economy for people to be able to spend it. I'm going to skin and sell all the leather to vendors and either level tailoring or mine nodes (that I'll just store in my bank) based on which class I level.
---
The only thing is that they don't have Taunt. They can keep agro pretty well, Righteous Fury and Consecration then the typical other spells. Righteous Fury gives you agro with holy spells so you can cast a bit of heals on yourself to gain a bit more. Though they do also lack defensive CDs that don't drop threat.  
---
If anything, lots of adds you can do for Raids. Though it'll be a bit difficult.
---
I agree there are my only issue with them is. You still look nothing like a rogue. You just look like a roided out fury warrior in leather lol. Not throwing shade at it. It's just not for me.
---
no that was vanilla, this is classic
---
but I get what you mean
---
Dun Morough
---
I love gnomes and the snowy aesthetic of the zone.
---
Durotar
---
I love Orcs and orgrimmar
---
Azshara 
---
it’s super beautiful and has cool endgame quests
---
Badlands
---
i enjoyed it in cata plus it had uldum-i don’t know what it was like in classic 
---
Swamp of Sorrows
---
i love the music and the ominous air to it all. also big fan of the lore
---
Mulgore&gt;everything else
---
I cast arcane missiles a few times there, and during the AoE whelp phase, cast arcane explosion and frost nova.  Remember, in vanilla, pretty much all the raid bosses were immune/resistant to fire.  So, fireball, fire blast, etc. didn't work on Molten Core bosses or Onyxia, as thematically, they were all fire breathers or forged in fire, etc. so it made sense from a theme perspective.  However, from a gameplay perspective, it got pretty dry being forced to be a frost mage until AQ came out (Blackwing Lair was the same way, and Arcane wasn't really a real spec, and was just something you put your remaining 1/3 talent points into for utility).  So, this basically boiled down to just spamming frostbolt and using your wand to regen mana back.  Such was the times.  So, to answer your question, I didn't use anything on my keyboard, as you can see I was moving as well.  Spamming frostbolt and using arcane missiles when you got a clearcast proc (talent in the arcane tree) was how things were done back then.
---
You realize that you can't mog something without actually having it, right?  Nobody would be able to mog tier 2 with their fresh 60 blue set.
---
Depends what you mean by "classic" experience. Do you mean basic official UI? Because DBM, Threat meters, Dps meters, raid frames etc have been around for a long time in vanilla.
---
I keep getting conflicting reports on FR gear in MC. I seems to see an even split of people saying only tanks need FR and the raid doesn't. Even for Rag.
---
What are your thoughts?
---
I clearly remember back in the day the raid using FR gear for the trash mob pulls past Garr, and for Rag.
---
Well the problem is all the extra numbers ontop of the major ones. In retail there's so many extra dots and effects going off it's hard to get a real idea of how much damage you're doing just by watching combat text.
---
In vanilla I don't have this problem at all.
---
i got gkicked from a guild for killing feign deathing hunters in AQ40 XD

---
I completely forgot about Nature's Grasp, which is weird given it always stuck out to me as a level 10 single point
---
I think most people are just feeling burnout more than the game being “bad”. I talked a few friends into playing again first time since Cata and they all love BfA because it feels so different from what they remember. Then other people who have been playing this new age WoW since MoP are getting tired of the new formula. 
---
It doesn’t seem like current wow is bad compared to other MMOs, it’s probably top 5 if not the top in terms of game design and shit to do. But when we have been grinding simple randomized loot from increasing difficulty raids with a chance to roll on a higher number for like 7 years now. Opposed to vanilla-wrath where it was just 1/2 difficulties and purple gear was harder to get, rather than now where your bag is always full of raid level gear from grinding your 10 weekly tasks so that you can perfectly min/max all 3 of your specs and all your alts as long as you grind, grind, grind easy tasks weekly.
---
Well yeah, obviously a bug, it's probably even fixed by now. Funnily enough it is similar to the vanilla bug that enabled it so they could leave it in as a homage. It's nothing like private servers where you could use it every mob levelling so it wouldn't actually change anything.
---
I can tell you're someone who just likes to argue.
---
agreed
---
This is actually nuts my dude
---
Not many people play the game this way
---
got to love collecting deviate leather for those first sweet blues

No guild banks = classic. Sounds good to me, isn't this called classic wow?

Edit: this is assuming he got the jump on  me or is higher level. If I happen to be near full resources and no mobs on me then Ill fight him.
---
&gt; players were obsessed with the specific ways of doing things
---
That literally is one of the most prominent traits of autism and I'm not saying this sarcastically.
---
Yes, but at that point you would rather have a warrior. Your job as a rogue in BGs is mostly about defending flag/bases, and occasionally hunt down the enemy flag carrier. You don't do much teamfighting.
---
I want to elaborate on what /u/ebaysllr said about Druid. It's true that premades only take 1. But for obvious reasons, Druids are extremely underpopulated at competitive levels. That means you are *very* in demand. I was probably a B-tier flagrunner on my best day but I got to play with the S-tier pvp premades because there were only like 3 PvP druids for them to pick from (on Nostalrius, which had 10k players online at any given time) during the time I was ranking. They are also generally willing to take you into AB even if you're not the most optimal pick, because they want to make sure they have high-rank druids to flag run for them in WSG. 
---
You also don't really go "feral" or "resto" as a pvp druid. There are a lot of different builds, but they are almost all hybrid specs. PvP druid doesn't neatly fit into one talent tree.
---
Which Class has the most potential in pvp at lvl 10?
---
I think a lot of people dont
---
Crit chance is theoretically a way to further customize your character.  Like an intellect mage that does good baseline damage vs a crit mage that does bad baseline damage but has lots of synergies with crit.  Not that it necessarily panned out like that, but especially vanilla WoW was loaded with that sort of RPG stuff that players (and eventually devs) have since optimized out of the game.
---
Yeah that was a druid bear! On my main (mage) one of our tanks was a druid bear, and with the ICC buff and bear CDs he'd break the 100k. Jaw-droppingly cool at the time but that already also made me kind of feel like WoW was going the wrong way with numbers, as my mage in TBC had like 12k or 14k or something HP in pvp gear
---
Fear of being kicked from the guild for low dps.
---
I can't speak to ESO, but Guild Wars 2 does it too. They add horizontal progression, new abilities and passives to unlock , new weapon skins, new stat combos on gear, and mounts in the latest expansion. It's well done, imo
---
The top guild on my horde server Bloodscalp, DPS would split their 40 man group into 2 20 mans and race to do MC. Mostly for more chances at thunderfurys. But also to bring in some bench raiders to gear as well.
---
dual box
---
yeah, translated it means: hi, i'm DEATHLY AFRAID OF FINDING ANECDOTES USING THE SEARCH BAR. please hand them to me and validate my soul
---
They stick with it. I was a troll rogue back in the day, the least played race class combo (according to like 2 graphs I’ve seen anyways) and I choose to just roll with it. Looked damn good in tier 2 imo, but was very much looked down on by the UDs. Besides, racials are neat in vanilla, but it’s not some competitive mind max game - any racial for any class is perfectly acceptable to do any content. 
---
You say you want to race change if your racial is nerfed or buffed. You being able to afford to buy to pay that, when someone else can, I mean that’s definitely pay 2 win territory, even if only mildly so. 
---
As much as any of that though, it’s a principle: no cash transactions that in any way impact gameplay. No level boosts, no mounts, no random cosmetic bs. That stuff has overtaken the entire gaming industry and diluted gameplay across the board. To many people, Classic is a hope for a time before all that.
---
We've finally come full circle. Back in the day everytime a new mmo came out every forum was saying "oh this is gonna be the WoW killer!" Now we have the classic wow forums saying theyre gonna be the WoW killer. Nice.
---
this is a bannable offense btw, you are not allowed to do this. so do not do it on live trust me YOU will get banned. we got many guilds banned that tried this over us infringes on blizzards rules. on griefing.
---
&gt; some people coming in to the game are worried about how hard its going to be to get the best stuff. 
---
I think that's what is going to be great about Classic if they don't move to other expansions or only design new dungeons horizontally. There's no time limit. You don't need to worry about how much time it takes to gear up if the content you're striving for won't be invalidated in a few months from some expansion or new raid. During WotLK, WoW turned into this treadmill of keeping up with the Joneses rather than this experience you could kind of deal with in your own time.
---
Hi, /u/kaschmircute
---
&gt; Back when r/classic wow only had a couple thousand subs, when everyone was just stoked at the prospect of playing on official vanilla servers again and the toxicity hadn't set in yet, almost everyone agreed on one thing - The ONLY change everyone wanted was a guild bank.
---
I can accept that vanilla was 15 years ago and I can't possibly remember all the mechanics and numbers from back then, but the classic wow announcement was less than two years ago and I definitely don't remember everyone on this sub agreeing on having guild banks.
---
that makes me golden lol!
---
im a simple man
---
Played Vanilla but started a bit after the rest, so by the time I was 60 my guild had already cleared MC, ZG and Ony. Was there to help them progress through BWL, AQ40 and the first couple of bosses in Naxx, then quit. Since then I've dabbled with some lowbies on private servers, but not touched retail.
---
Not really, Legion dealt with previous expansions and being an old ass game and I enjoyed it for the most part. BFA was just fucking boring, the necklace was boring, the grind was very apparent and boring the Titanforge made most of the content pointless and boring, the classes were pruned and boring, the expeditions were pointless and boring, I could go on and on and on.               
---
             
---
BFA wasnt bad because it had to be, BFA was bad because Ion thought spreadsheets knew more than WoW Players.
---
This is bad. At least lock layers so you can't abuse them. Make you able to choose which layer you start on and stick to it. When they stop layering you can merge layers. Or you know, DON'T HAVE LAYERS?
---
And rogues have blind, gouge and stuns.
---
This is seriously one of the things that I've been most excited for in Classic. A 3K crit felt huge, and huge in a way that made sense. Seeing the slow progression from 20 damage crits to thousands really made it feel like your toon was becoming strong. 
---
When our guild brought on a MT that got to 9.5K buffed health, I just about lost my mind. Values just felt like they carried more weight when they weren't in the hundreds of thousands.
---
From a 2011 [thread](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/2191130564) on the official forums: 
---
&gt;I went on a raid of Sun Rock Retreat when I was like a level 47 mage with my guild. We had maybe 30 players. Being an AOE class I accidentally tagged an npc like the stable master or something. Dishonorable Kill pops up on my screen along with everyone else in the raid. Somebody really flew off the handle in teamspeak (this is the old days) because he was going to lose so much ground in his honor farming. He was so mad it really spoiled the fun of killing horde. This, I think, is why they ended that system.
---

Sorry for slightly moving some dirt around...
---
We moved and replanted the dead tree that was there though.
---
It's not our fault you build your stick huts on an ancient civilization that built massive stone monuments that possessed technology beyond comprehension.  My bad.
---
You're trying to make a rational argument against an irrational mind.  Shitbags will still, as always, and even back in Vanilla, be shitbags.
---
Can do Enchanting/Herb if you want. Though you can still grind as a Shaman, did not have much troubles as a RSham back then. Plus even with Skinning/LW, you can skin the mobs of others.  
---
Enhance is still pretty good, unless you're aiming to be a hardcore raider. Even then, had an Enhance shaman in my BWL group.
---
You're doing it wrong. Title should be: "Am I the only one...?"

oh stressnis 10 this time ? i may login again then , not that you can do anything at 10

there was an exploit i want to see if i can replicate but im not sure if load caused it last stress test
---
#NoChanges!!!! You will look at that ceiling &amp; floor like a decent human being!!!
---
What? Haha. You have 24 people who said in 4 months they will show up and play with you, on a server you don’t know, on a faction most will change, after weeks of leveling. 
---
Yea I’m sure those 24 players you got are real committed.
---
&gt; Doesn't matter. It won't happen. Keep wasting your time tho.
---
Same reply the No Vanilla crowd used for years. That didn’t work out so good for them did it?
---
I'm currently stuck between Rogue and Hunter.
---
Narrowed it down to these two after deciding i don't really want to tank or heal, not massively interested in Warlocks although Mage does have a lot of tempting parts i think the sheer number of them will put me off somewhat.
---
I'm looking to do as much as i can in the game, so i'd like to raid and PvP too. No experience at all with Vanilla (i first played briefly in late TBC and later played Hunter and Paladin in late WoD/Legion/BFA) so i appreciate i will probably be quite bad but i'd love to be able to settle on one of these two classes and really 'main' them and get good at what they can do.
---
Some things that attract me to Rogue are from what i've read they are pretty consistently good DPSers throughout vanilla, stealth makes a lot of things far easier, they look badass and the old wPvP and ganking shenanigans looks like such a laugh and is obviously something i never got to experience. Meanwhile with Hunter, pet makes levelling and solo content in general a breeze, seems like raids will always need some (ok only a handful at best but still!), can get up to some tricks in PvP with traps and Feign Death etc.
---
Some things that concern me with Rogue is competition with others of the same class (i hear they are going to be very popular) and ability to make gold independently. Meanwhile, with Hunter the deadzone is somewhat off putting to someone who only played the class in later expansions, i'm concerned about how difficult pet management may be in PvE/PvP and also the sheer amount of buttons they seem to have (i might be overthinking this one though!). Also, i often read how they don't scale well with gear so are comparatively weaker further into progression which feels a bit bad as it's always a better feeling to feel as though you're character has gotten more powerful.
---
Whatever i choose i plan to join a group/guild before release and then hopefully i'll be able to level with others quite hardcore for the first week after release, my other dilemma is which faction to pick but that's a question for another time!
---
Thanks for reading if you took the time to! :)
---
and C L A S S I C is KING
---
Trex basically humans confirmed.
---
I believe you can macro right stance in abilities, so stance dancing is not much of a issue. Someone can correct me if im wrong.
---
But every class has it's good and bad. I don't think theres classes in classic that can do everything good. Just pick  one you want with least "anoying" downside. I would recommend warlock for you, based on your post.

This sounds shocking at first, but most of us unsubbed long before the Cata world existed longer than the Vanilla world. I played in Cata for like a few months before quitting the game. Therefore I definitely remember the "Vanilla" world more (in fact I don't remember anything from Cata). And this probably stands true for most of the 5-10 million who unsubbed in those years.

Not from a tauren.

Don't forget to have one boomkin with the mages for the spell crit. u/esfand
---
I think infinite scaling could be okay, just not in the way that Diablo did it. For one, the numbers get out of control stupidly fast. In Path of Exile you spend a crapton of time and effort into a character to finally get him into the millions of DPS, not billions.
---
Although, real talk, the biggest problem with Diablo 3 is just that it only has a single end game. Nothing really matters in the end game apart from rifts. There's no choice at all for the players for what they want to do, what type of end game they want to focus on. Worse, that end game is randomly generated, meaning that the only effective builds are builds that "can do everything", i.e. AoE clear, single target kill bosses, and survive.
---
The irony is that in their attempt to "generate something new every rift" they actually just forced players to all have the same set of strengths in order to progress. It's a prime example of procedurally generated content gone horribly wrong and actually reducing the amount of effective content in the game. Which is just really impressive in this case, as they literally had 4/5 acts worth of content and they somehow jammed it together and reduced it to a single generic mess.
---
Shut up. I still consider Post-Cataclysm Azeroth an abomination.
---
Oh yeah for sure. Sorry I shoulda worded that better. I mostly mean that Addons weren’t super prominent by such a large part of the player base back then, including me. So part of me wants to replicate that. I don’t want everything to be super optimized/netspeced as I won’t be going cutting edge anyway.
---
Yea don’t tell me what my opinion is. My first post was clearly making fun of yet another “classic will kill retail WoW”. 
---
Show me where I talk about bfa not being dead or not hates?
---
10 man would be a dungeon imo, make it a raid - 20 people !
---
thats the Earthmother's dirt ya little midget
---
Why would you complain about the Activision side when Blizzard is making it?
---
I wonder what this guy is up to now
---
If someone starts killing just leave. One DHK won't ruin your CP.
---
Deep feral druid has big burst; it lacks sustained dps which is why it has a hard time in raids. You absolutely are a Jack of all Trades, but you have your niches if you work at them. Resto is fine, bear is fine, and PvP is very fun imo.
---
Trying to win the fishing contest.
---
Play my alt. They get bored.
---
Oh, so the old world zones weren't made irrelevant by later expansions and you're saying the OP was wrong.
---
I am not a D3 fanatic, but a few of my coworkers are and I occasionally play a Season with them.
---
Infinite scaling CAN make a game feel completely meaningless, if the scaling interrupts the pace or goal of the game. It carries a lot of synergy in D3 though. Everything scales. Builds scale because you can find multiple tiers of your same Build, you can carry multiple builds for different types of runs, etc. 
---
The numbers and stats on the item only serve to tell you if that item is BiS for your build. Other than that your real focus is how efficiently you can clear your runs and how deep into the scaling you can go. It's a strange beast and it scratches a very particular itch. I would never play it by myself, but it's a lot of fun to spend a few hours in Discord with friends grinding it out.
---
what do you mean by "knew more than WoW players?"
---
Theres so many conflicting opinions on the fourms idk how they even find anything useful there
---
Just because retail went that way, doesn’t mean Blizzard has to go that route again where they specifically set out to not dumb the game down. It’s a fallacy. And it wasn’t small QoL changes that fucked retail. It was huge changes like LFD/LFR, flying, removal of choice, excessive dumbing down, linear gameplay, etc that fucked it.
---
I wish they hadn't had such a clear divide between regular gear and resistance gear. I liked how Tier 1 and 2 sets had resistance and wish they continued the trend.
---
This makes me so much more excited. I really hated the cross-realm. It was like always playing with strangers. It was very detrimental to the community feeling to me.
---
I think, at the time, this issue could be blamed on the mentality from predecessor games like Everquest. These games had MASSIVE imbalances far beyond WoW, and this was acceptable if not expected at the time.
---
&gt; Healer will be much different than in retail. You really have to manage your mana better, most good healers follow a 5 second rule (for a tick of mana regen)
---
Unless you're a paladin. Then you just spam FoL and don't ever go oom anyway
---
Warlocks for sure.  You have fear.  Nothing beats fear spam at level 10....
---
Ok that or maybe a hunter.
---
Can you update number 9 being people outlining every type of post like other people have done and conveniently forgetting they too are a type of overdone post?
---
I should probably mention that I'm the guy in the video who took it. I'm not somebody who feels bad that Asmon didn't get it. EDIT: I know it isnt ninja looting cause gurubashi
---
That would make it something you don’t use in 5 mans tho
---
Play orc use tmorph for the undead model
---
The solution to that is leave the queue if something comes up in real life. And have the game either kick you from the queue or drop you to the bottom if you d/c. 
---
The chances of d/cing or something in real life happening between when the queue pops and when you press accept are small enough to ignore.
---
I have about 10 RL friends who are going to start a guild with me. We are going to plan on playing different classes for the most part so we can easily make dungeon groups. 
---
We will pull the rest of our raid team from recruited players as we level to 60 and gear up in dungeons. Will assign role leads to manage Heals/DPS/RDPS based on commitment to the guild and performance when we start raiding. 
---
I plan on raid leading and Main Tanking. I was stuck on Twin Emps for months because we kept getting our tanks poached before the BC apathy hit. Won’t have that happen if I’m Main Tank this time. 
---
Most guilds on live right now don’t have more than 25 active raiders. So most guilds will either merge with other guilds or recruit to fill their spots. Key is to get into an active guild and be active. Help guild mates level and gear up. Will give you a better chance of getting a raid spot when your guild starts putting together a raid team.
---
My first character was a Tauren druid. I was stuck in the starting zone since I didnt know how to get past these mountains. Didnt occure to me to follow the road since the only "rpg" games I played were Zelda games and those typically didnt have roads to follow.
---
But boy I had fun back then.
---
WORLD FIRST BIS LIST FOR LEVEL 10 TALENTS ALL CLASSES
---
Over my pink mustachio’d dead body
---
&gt;Once you got your FR for MC and had that on farm, you essentially stood around waiting for raiding.
---
I disagree. Because of how expensive everything is, and how you need to craft consumables, get world buffs and even visit dungeons to get enchants like Librams I always found I had infinitely more to do when I play private servers than I ever did in any expansion with perhaps the exception of TBC.
---
The game is also slower, so you can spend more time playing without running out of things to do. It's not uncommon to spend the entire evening doing two strat runs and ending up with a single Righteous Orb f.ex.
---
It's ok though, it's back!
---
Minus wall-walking (which really should be brought back too since it was an integral part of exploration at the time.)
---
42 for Deathcoil. Once you get that, rogues aren't much of a worry anymore.
---
I wouldn't call it lazy, it's just a very extreme scaling system. I only play D3 when I have time to play with coworkers, but the health and damage numbers almost feel like a relic. The game is more centered around clearing efficiency and speed than dungeon crawling. D3 is some off the rails chaos and if I am in the mood for a grindfest, it scratches that itch extremely well
---
I'd say druid. You get rank 2 on wrath and moonfire and entangling roots, so you can cast, heal, cc and kite in bear form to regain mana and start over. Rank 2 mark of the wild and demoralizing shout will make you almost immune to auto attacks.
---
Exactly - the group of people against layering want it to fail so badly that they'll latch onto any instance where it doesn't work as proof that it shouldn't go live, rather than test and submit meaningful bug reports that would improve the tech.
---
Just have ozzy back but give his lock green fire
---
reshoot the exact same commercial otherwise
---
Being surprised and letting rogues get the opener makes it tough, but you still can win. Cheap Shot and Kidney remove a good deal of damage from rogues, so if you can live through that (or the ambush, evis) and stabilize you have a chance. Might not work all the time, but here's some ways to stabilize.
---
Mage - Nova -&gt; sheep-&gt; bandage-&gt; eat and drink. Reset.
---
Shaman - NS heal -&gt; shield + dagger-&gt; juke kick.
---
Druid - Warstomp (if Tauren) -&gt; If not Tauren, Bear Stun -&gt; Regrowth -&gt; FF -&gt; Rejuv -&gt; MF -&gt; Bear
---
Warlock - Prolly die. It's tough at that level range as a warlock. If you can get fear off... maybe?
---
Priest - Scream -&gt; Mindblast -&gt; SW:P -&gt; PW:S -&gt; Heal-&gt; Wand &amp; Reapply dots
---
Hunter - Scatter -&gt; Trap -&gt; Kite
---
Paladin -  Bubble or HoJ to heal -&gt; Ret aura -&gt; SoC -&gt; Switch to Dev aura if damage is too high
---
These are all best case scenarios, but there's a chance.
---
A lot of people don't want this. They want to pretend they're 14 years old again running home after school to play, *but this time* they hold all the power and will totally be #1! No mom to tell them when to go to bed, no homework to do, etc. No changes = time machine.
---
For me, I just want Blizzard to return to the core game philosophy that was present during Vanilla. They never had to actually resell me Vanilla, though I'd take that over retail in a heartbeat.
---
It’s not a ninja. It’s a free for all chest good on you for getting it.
---
My friends and I did the same exact thing in BC/Wrath. If guilds are organized enough to put together 40-man raids they can delegate gear to their guild members without a guild bank through their officers etc, as you stated.
---
If a rogue doesn't wait until after Blink is on CD or the mage is facing a wall, they're not a rogue. You wait until they're eating/drinking, then you strike. But yeah, Ambush + Evis with the right talents could GCD a mage.
---
In this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgJDO6ZaMmQ  
---
which is supposed to be from 2005 according to the video description, shows that the dwarf player can clearly see horde players almost at the horde tunnel, all the way from alliance resto hut (check 0:24)
---
bahaha, self described and proud vanilla ninja looter gets fucking owned by a ninja, with "then you'll really know what it's like" singing in the background, this is pure perfection.
---
Not the same, at all
---
Levelling is already boring when you've done it many times.  We just want to get to end-game faster.
---
I have, first few seasons but after awhile it was just randoms after randoms to a point where they might have been randomly generated PvE npc’s like from the ToC. It’s not something I enjoy today, though I do like watching the Blizzard Worlds. As for Classic, seeing the same people in the battlegrounds on the opposite side or on your side you developed more of a social understanding with each other. I remember a warrior on my server to this day that his name inspired fear among the Alliance side since he was one of the first Rank 14’s and could actually play his class. I never got that in the arena. That’s at least what I’m looking forward towards most, Community.
---
12/7/2004 here lol. I was only like 8 at the time but my dad was into MMOs so i started early :)
---
There are definitely a few items from MC that NEVER became obsolete due to rarity and loot scarcity. Particularly trinkets and Thunderfury bindings
---
Spam /sigh and /sit to get it over with.
---
i know but you get what im saying
---
You make more money as a leader, but you have way more fun as a follower.
---
Right with you on this OP
---
I don't see it happening.
---
I did the same! I had sold my account over 10 years ago, though, so I had to do some digging to locate my original CDKey.
---
I logged in to find my Warrior leveled to 69, and still holding pieces of BWL loot. Sadly, I'm sure a lot of it was vendored during TBC. :(
---
"why are you doing this on stream??!" 
---
Highlights why blizzards beta invite strategy is aggravating. Lots of this stuff just won't be figured out untill release.
---
Druids can get to 2000/3000 to Friendly before the AQ Content releases. I'm assuming in Phases 1 through 3 we wont be able to farm CC rep/quests in Silithus yet.
---
I got this....  Warlock with a point in suppression.  Imp as the pet.  Unstoppable dueling potential
---
# #nochanges
---
Alliance side it's Human hands down. The +5 sword skill is a mega buff to pve. Which means the best guilds are going to prefer to give humans the best gear. In addition to that paranoia is bugged on private servers. It will be way stronger on retail classic. So you can also spot stealthers very well.
---
r/whoosh
---
Bro you ppl really don’t understand the point of a beta do you?
---
Don't be so belligerent, Benny.
---
There are many builds, but the two most important things to get are feral charge and nature's swiftness. Everything else is (laregly) opinion and style. I ran flags as a deep feral spec (no NS) because I raid tanked with it as well, and I didn't have problems. If I were to run a pure flagcarry spec I would probably go with:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZtGMsf0dLVeboso
---
But I would make tweaks based on the premade I ran with and their needs.
---
;)
---
Yeah, once we all caught wind that TBC greens would be better than Naxx stuff, the game just sort of died for a while. Up until that point people legitimately thought that of course AQ/Naxx gear would be really good until at least the mid 60's or something.
---
A lot of newer MMOs do this thing where they create these massive worlds but you can level up only using 25% of the world. Like what was the point of making a massive world if you don’t intend to utilize it all. Make us travel from location to location. Every game also gives you a bonus for logging in daily, like why do we need this. Fast travel and mount from the beginning do no justice for a game either. Then they market the level scaling by saying you can go to any zone and quest. It just makes the entire world feel pointless if there are no hard zones/easy zones.
---
People streaming the beta are seasoned veterans and some are rank 1 gladiators. Of course they won’t wipe in deadmines
---
Yeah... fuck that
---
I don't think cross-region is acceptable for a retail version, you can't make people pay for a degraded experience. However in EU we could use an official EU server promoted by Blizzard, instead of just invading a popular English server and claim it EU serv.
---
Could be they wanted to reduce a little the total numbers attempting to login and play. They may feel the numbers they had last time in a single server were to high compared to what they expect from launch.
---
Claiming superiority for playing a video game? I found a boomer. What faction are playing?
---
I prefer Lil Peep.
---
Imagine that you don't play video games, but you do play the game of life, and you're absolutely crushing it with selling video games.
---
A meeting occurs.
---
In this meeting the revenue from WoW Classic is shown on a slide, then on the next slide you see the old population changes, and the huge leap in individual users from Vanilla to TBC.
---
Now you have two options.  You can pay the team you just organized to do the same thing they did with Classic to TBC again, without any creative cost, or you can assemble a new team to test new content.
---
If I'm sitting in that chair you get TBC and WoTLK servers.  Even though my heart desires novel new content created with the core concepts of Classic.
---
Alts may relive the old content, but you have classes that play different. On retail it feels so much the same (and I'm a huge altoholic). Not to mention getting to experience the class quests for other classes.
---
Wwhen the game actually launches.  The bgs are gonna be x realm   and lose that sense of community they currently have In beta.
---
I love both horde and dwarves :)
---
&gt; If I'm sitting in that chair you get TBC 
---
I'm very happy with that too.
---
FFXI as well. 15% haste pants at 75 (1st expansion) were better than everything for at least the ENTIRE 2 next expansions, and probably still pretty great or even BiS for the third and fourth mini-expansions, but I quit by that point so idk for sure.
---
I don't think that was a major issue for these games though, because their expansions weren't really designed the same way as WoW. 75 was the cap in FFXI from the first to third expansion and the game used multiple gear sets and you could change your gear mid-combat, so everyone had tons of gear macros. You didn't just have one PvP set and one PvE set like early WoW, you had 3-6 sets PER fight for every fight depending on class. So even if one piece of gear was BiS forever, it was still just one piece of around 24+ that you needed with you at all times.
---
WoW's gear system is designed completely different though. You can't change gear (besides weapons) in the middle of a fight and the entire expansion system is designed totally different as well. It's like a new version of WoW each time with a level cap increase and all old gear gets thrown away in terms of usefulness. You essentially start over but keep your character. The leveling is just a little faster since it's from 60-70,. 70-80 etc.
---
&gt; Particularly trinkets
---
As a Hunter by the time AQ rolls I want Blackhand Breadth and the Dire Maul Hunter trinket or DFT.
---
From MC I want Core Hound Tooth and that's about it, but the Tooth can be replaced by something else.
---
i mean, as long as they have a food/flask, it shouldn't be a big deal. it's not like you need every different buff for fucking MC or Onyxia.
---
Yeah you just have fun and play your hardest! You can do both at the same time. Just play!
---
iirc a guy did 15 the other day and filmed it
---
more than one monitor was hard back then. hell people were still on pentium 2 and  3
---
The WoW killer all this time was just WoW itself. Amazing
---
you're the hero we deserve, then.
---
There would be noone left to RP
---
dont play then, nice repost btw
---
They are doing EU friendly ish testing this time :-)
---
Hope they retcon Northrend and make it vanilla style, like lvl 40 to 60 just ice all over the place and a few quests and mobs here and there.
---
Lol you mean you would do a dungeon and go up 4 levels and then be done with the zone. Those were the days of quick leveling.
---
The suspense is killing me.... I’m trying to fill my time with d2/ mount and blade
---
Last two weeks i was struggling whether to go female or male UD Mage.
---
Played male UD  Mage in vanilla,keeping that barkeeper flaire ;)
---
&gt;You can just faceroll a dungeon without thinking or using strategy promotes bad behavior.
---
I think you're confusing game mechanics designed to introduce new players to the game as some sort of design flaw.  I think it's perfectly tuned for my wifes first time in a dungeon on her boomkin, just as it should be.
---
You really cannot ask this question now without expecting to get downvoted into hell.  Peope right now are super sensitive and just want their "baby back" so to speak.  Any idea of addition or change will turn all them overgrown man childs into little cry babies over nostalgia.  
---
Once the time table of release is complete, all content is available, and people have smashed through the content, then people would be more willing a look at what can come next.  But to ask a question about additions and changes at the moment will only trigger all those simple minded folk.
---
People hate change.  Gamers are straight up allergic.  You won't garner any positive response now.
---
This is how you make an argument. I wish people would take note.
---
TBC made any high-level content from vanilla obsolete because you no longer needed gear from such content to get better gear. TBC didn't really make content of a lower level than that obsolete though. You were still going through the zones in order and benefiting from dungeons. Leveling might have been faster but it wasn't *too* fast that you would outlevel the zones.
---
This stuff happened when I played in Legion too. This isn't just some unfortunate bug in a beta. Layering makes this game worse.
---
I think Female Dwarfs have the very best 2Hander special animation. If you can stand their walking animation and bouncy tits I would do it.
---
I remember AQ 40 trinkets we’re still viable (albeit gimicky) in WotLK. 
---
Badge of Swarmguard added up to 1200 armor penetration. For warriors it could fully proc off one WW. 
---
Scarab Brooch gave a shield of 15% whatever you healed. It scaled amazingly up to patch 4.0.1
---
Eye of Diminuation was from Naxx but was popular on Black Temple bosses.
---
To the people who waited in the previous stress test:
---
Does the Realm Selection interface update in real time? Or do I need to continuously relog to see the change from offline to live?
---
Edit: just saw the realm type go from normal to PvP so we can infer that the population tab update in real time too most likely
---
I always prefer Dorf or Orc. Humans aren’t bad either. Had a male Nelf in vanilla, never again.
---
Good - hopefully the servers will stabalize by the time i get home from work.
---
Yeah, but this was a player going away, not a mob, so it's different.
---
I've personally seen mobs despawn and others respawn before in the stress test, so what you're saying is *certainly* an issue!
---
Wait... totally forgot we can BG..
---
Epic post!
---
Scaling was a neat idea on paper, and for a player like me that plays tons of alts it was refreshing, but it removed any sense of power gains. You never again had that feeling that there was a portion of your adventure that you just weren't ready for. That's what I'm looking forward to in Classic.
---
My anime dad can beat your anime dad...
---
jesus
---
So engineering/Alchemy on warrior &amp; mining/herbalism on hunter/alt?
---
I plan to have 2 characters- any great PvPer spec alts?
---
But I don’t like the jumper cables dad
---
Has gaming become like movies and WoW is the Spider man of video games?  We'll just re-release it every 15 years or so when a new generation is old enough to game? lol
---
This no changes concept is extremely hard for some people to grasp isn't it.
---
The numbers i dont care too much about, what i am looking forward to is understanding the numbers. In retail you press one button and a bunch of different size numbers are popping up. It becomes so complicated to actually track whats happening with the numbers, while on classic/vanilla its much simpler and more logical.
---
Yes bc you went 3 months ahead and know it will be in the game. Thanks
---
You have to avoid being in that position. As a general rule, don't ever fight more than one mob in STV. Always get full HP and mana after each mob. Most classes have some ways of avoiding the gank if at least half mana and high health. A similar leveled rogue can't stunlock you for long at these levels, so you will get a chance to react as long as your health don't drop below 50% or so.
---
Clothies have a hard time if the rogue is ambush spec, which might just delete half of your health or more in one instant hit. Others have a fair chance of fight.
---
As a hunter I always used an addon called UnitScan. If a rogue really managed to gank me, I'd add his name to a watch list from this addon. It scans the area around me and as soon as the name is spotted it auto-targets it. I would spam the hotkey to instantly cast Hunter's Mark as soon as he's spotted. Then I used a dot and he can't stealth anymore. Without the surprise, rogues are crap and I'd usually gank them back 2 or three times :-)
---
he shoots he scores!
---
So you're a 1.0 for life kinda guy?
---
Bro this happens in BFA too
---
I remember the first time I saw someone with over 1M hp, I was blown away. It was a rogue too! Things just got worse from there lol
---
real time
---
Because that makes perfect sense, dumbass. A bit redundant don't you think?
---
For a sub dedicated to classic you sure do post about retail a lot
---
Eh, maybe, generally by the time people are on AQ/Naxx there are gen chat pickup groups doing MC for people that still need it.
---
How was that layering if they could see each other before they grouped?
---
I agree with you completely. While I hate it in WoW and other games, D3 numbers don't mean shit and it doesn't effect how badass you are. In an mmorpg, you don't want to one-shot enemies or melt them in seconds. You are trying to team up with people and take down massive foes with teamwork. The entire point of Diablo is to MASS SLAUGHTER enemies by the hundreds and then go into the next room and repeat. Some people may not like that, but that is the entire point of the genre. The numbers never made you feel badass in anyway, what made you feel badass was crushing your enemies, seeing them driven before you and to hear the lamentations of their women.
---
What a new and original post.
---
It’s a stupid and narrow minded concept.
---
well multi-millionaire for a reason. Not spending money on things you don't need or can't get an investment return :D. Have the same kind of dad (as many others probably) but without the multi and millionaire.
---
I don't think you even read anything besides the title? Was specifically asking if there was a decurisve addon or built into another addon and if any type of Omen threat meter was planned or available not stated on that website.
---
I didn’t know bfa was getting re released?
---
There are about a dozen different ways to level up an alt, unless you insist on doing it the most optimal way every single time. Also &gt;referring to leveling 1-60 as a "sooo slow grind" lol.
---
People were not excited for TBC because we were bored with vanilla. We were excited because it was an expansion to the game everyone was addicted to and loved playing.
---
Downvoted the BfA shill.
---
Raggy can be done with everyone in pre raid gear except maybe the tank. People were doing this with alts in vanilla already. My first guild went through MC in our first week with 3/4 of the raid in blues and greens.
---
You do know Vanilla had those things right? At least the server transfer and race changes...as for the pay 2 win...thats a stretch. Its like saying me getting Fios Gigabit is pay 2 win because not everyone has it.
---
Wall jumping into Hyjal from Winterspring was my favorite. Just an entire empty zone that you could run through and explore... and wall jump up at the summit and reach an invisible ceiling, then subsequently fly down with a parachute into the zones to the south...
---
The rumor there was that somewhere in that invisible ceiling was a drop that would take you to the Emerald Dream.
---
you do realize there already has been a bunch of changes right?
---
Do you know how many times we've heard "this is beta, relax" shittalk for last decade? Pls, just don't.
---
blue post last week already brought to the public eye that the numbers from the wow team were correct.  but thanks for verifying their work anyways.
---
Viable - adj, capable of working successfully; feasible.
---
A group of 5 is a bit excessive, you don't need that many. 3-4 works well. 
---
I've played a lot of fresh servers in the past couple years and I've always done fine so let me throw my advance, though it comes from pservers which have heavy dynamic respawns, where as classic seemly will be a mix of dynamic(in 1-10 zone) and layering, but hopefully these techniques still work.
---
Launch is chaotic, grouping in the first couple of mins is hard, everyone should try to solo kill mobs to get lvl2. Don't worry about boar quest you will most likely not be able to complete it, just grind anything for exp while the mobs are still up. Then you pick up quests and go west to do the kill boar quests(not the loot boar, im talking about the lvl3 boars), you do this with your group. Then you go do the troll quest and the followup boss. The tools quest is always garbage on pservers, maybe it wont be on classic idk. This should get you close to 4, you start moving to dun morough grinding on the way in group since you need a fuck ton of meat and shit from bears and boars for the quests in kharanos. Then basically you start in group, grind everything and do all the quests. Most quests are fine to do in group honestly because you will be so far ahead of the pack(you wont be much far in levels but you are doing quests that other people can't do solo). You just continue questing and go for lvl 10, try do some loch modan and then you can split up. People that don't want to do DM goes darkshore since it's better exp, those who do want do to dm go westlands/loch questing so they can get all the prequest stuff done.
---
12, I played with my dad and we were both NE druids.
---
You used to be able to tag the elites outside BRD, then have someone else kill them, and still get full XP from them.  I went from 50-52 in something silly, like two hours, doing this.  But it got nerfed :(  You could also level from 50-60 pretty easily in AV when it was full of NPCs.
---
Stream man bad. Old game good.
---
We finally found the WoW killer after all these years, we only had to look in the mirror!
---
Scorpid because it has venom and you protect your venom shot from venom decurse
---
Well yeah, vanilla was/is an extremely roughly-designed game.  Nobody including Blizzard really knew all that much about how their decisions would pan out, just look at what happened with hybrids.  But the *idea* was still sound.
---
Also I'm pretty sure they had reforging in Cata.  But I'm generally not a fan of it, especially when we already had gear customization with gem slots.  It just seemed unnecessary.
---
WoW is still the most played MMO. You're delusional if you think WoW is in an way dead.
---
You want OC? Try r/HighQualityGifs
---
You want relevant OC? Please let me know if you find it.
---
whos gonna play vern troyer
---
&gt; Yes, nobody expects Betas to be perfect, but downvoting major bugs to decrease visibility is a great way to ensure the bug stays in the game upon release.
---
Because this post isn't a bug report, it's trying to shit on Blizzard.
---
You been playing a beta for WOW classic rerelease for 10 years? That’s pretty weird dude
---
so many fucking noobs will by crying about wiping and hard game on launch dont worry brajajaj
---
What makes Classic special to me is that it's the only version of WoW which has a clear beginning, middle, and end. Rather than the leveling phase being a speedbump along the way to endgame content, Classic is the only phase of WoW where leveling was an adventure in of itself. I never raided Naxxramas, but it must've been an awesome feeling to think of how far your character progressed from the days where they'd struggle to kill wolves in Elwynn Forest or Quilboars in Durotar. You go from wearing greys and whites and fighting lowly Kobolds to slaying dragons and elemental lords and old gods. Each expansion after Vanilla has brought a "reset" of sorts, but although all your old gear gets invalidated your character has already pulled off incredible feats - they're already a "Champion" and not the grunt they started as at the beginning. And the player characters haven't really progressed from that point except in Legion perhaps when they became Archdruid/Highlord etc.
---
The only problem is WoW didn't really have a cohesive narrative until Wrath of the Lich King. The closest you get in Vanilla is the Missing Diplomat chain which starts with Kobolds causing trouble in the mines of Northshire Abbey, which leads to the Defias Brotherhood in Elwynn and Westfall, then the Deadmines, then to corrupt nobles in Stormwind, the Stockades, the kidnapping of Varian Wyrnn, and eventually the awesome Onyxia questchain where you uncover Katrana Prestor's true identity and unravel the conspiracy which led to the rise of the Defias and the kidnapping of Stormwind's king. It's awesome in theory, but unfortunately the Missing Diplomat questline was never truly finished and Varian Wrynn is left chilling in a dingy sewer until Wrath of the Lich King.
---
Ive played a few times, never made it to max level though. Really excited for classic, as 40 man raids are one of those experiences I’ve always wanted to try but never been able to. Super excited to play the game but I’d be lying if I said I wasnt nervous about how hard itll be to get into a raiding guild having never done raiding before, and once I’m in there being able to keep up since Im assuming most people will have done most of the raids before. Might see if I can find a guild thats mostly first timers.
---
Yes, the circle of life.
---
You can start farming rep in patch 1.8 with nightmare dragons. I can't remember how the phase works so idk if you will have that before war effort. Doing the summoning lords shit is actually very profitable for those who summon, and it's decent rep.
---
I think it has to be that way. D3 really has no upper limit to character power, apart from gear. There is no real max level. The simple fact is that changing and item's set bonus from 10,000% increased damage to 50,000% is all it takes to climb even higher GRs.
---
Your Nephalem character is supposed to feel absurdly powerful (you're the son/daughter of an angel + demon) and you eventually defeat the Prime Evil.
---
Doesn't work well in WoW when your character has much more humble beginnings and every expansion has NPC heroes who are, individually, significantly more powerful than your character. Getting the "Saviour of Azeroth" title in Cataclysm felt so weird considering how central Thrall was to the story.
---
I'm happy to go to a world without Raider iO ruling the pug world.
---
you can get to hyjal without wall walking and then slowfall/noggin to the troll village
---
How about a heroic mode that doesn't drop stronger loot, but more drops, better chances at legendary stuff, gold recipes etc. And just more dmg and health on mobs with maybe am extra mechanic or two. This would be way far out after max release.
---
That's why I said they should do it silently.
---
Comments like this really make my day! Glad you enjoy the playlist. See you in Azeroth!
---
Trying to decide between Rogue and Shaman. I've been slowly narrowing down the list of classes based on Leveling/PVE &gt; PVP &gt; raiding. Played warlock and druid back in Vanilla, TBC and enjoyed both. I think I liked the aspect of being flexible with my druid. But overall I liked melee over casters even though I thoroughly enjoyed my warlock.
---
I think rogue is the safe choice in case I get into end game raiding. But I do like the idea of going Shaman because I could see my self playing any of the specs even though I prefer Ench, even tho it's not as good in 1.12 (or that's what I hear). But I fear Ench would be bottom tier in raids and lose out on possible 2h weapons to warriors.
---
Crit isn't the only thing that uses the rating system though.
---
What about dodge? They bake that into agil? Or parry? Bake that into strength?
---
This would make pretty much all secondary stats obsolete.
---
I think I'm using the term correctly. It seemed like adding him to the group pushed them all to a new layer
---
It's not a change if nobody knows.
---
I suggest solo for 1-10
---
&gt; Rank 14 grind would be completely different if it was based on skill
---
It wouldn't be a grind at all.
---
Still no invite, amazing.
---
You would appreciate it more now knowing that it was a sarcastic /s to take it that much more over the time.

GARBAGE, Hard pass. Just buff everything in the game 20%. There should only be one path. Multiple paths are hell on the devs and ruin the game. I also think people are getting pre-emptively hype on how easy classic is. Based on watching people in the beta play. Most of which are hard core hardened vets. Not representative of the average player.
---
Also what makes classic wow better is not that it's "hard" per se. When people say that they are communicating poorly. What makes classic wow great is that everything in the game demands you slow down and take it seriously. From the leveling to the dungeons to the raids. If you do that they may be easy but, you do have to do that.
---
As opposed to Retail where the entire game is a complete joke until you activate "magic seals" to make it harder. Most people lose all interest in the game long before that. Most people never make it to magic key 15 and, don't care to try. It's like Blizzard is asking you to read a series of books. That is shitty mush until you get to book 15 and finally you get to some real plot. Sorry fam you lost me half way through book one.

Press x
---
Totally right, we also took our two years in retail classic to figure stuff out, and another several years to minmax it 😄
---
The OP is written in a way that is ridiculously biased and dismissive of anyone who would disagree with his view.   
---
Stuff like this:    
---
&gt;It's a change people should be able to get behind that had literally no downside now that we're past all that "slippery slope" nonsense.   
---
and this:   
---
&gt;everyone still had enough sense to recognize that vanilla DID have some issues that were corrected later in the game, and that it made sense for those changes to carry into classic.    
---
He is saying "of course everyone agrees with me".
---
Well even in Alpha and Beta for BFA players were telling them Shaman was broken/not fun and Ion basically said "What the fuck do you people know?"            
---
It was VERY apparent people testing the game were ignored, I dont think BFA had to be bad and sure Ion gets quiet a bit of goodwill here because of his no change stance but pretending he isnt the one who dragged Retail through the mud is kind of insane.           
---
         
---
I mean I'm happy BFA wound up bad so Classic will have a very healthy population boost but now I'm wondering when the next expansion will come and if anyone will even bother playing it.              
---
                
---
***Edit*** For the record I turned my Sub off in October so I am not a retail fan at all I just think BFA didnt have to be as bad as it is
---
KK, wasn't sure if the hoppy-hop in Winterspring counted as wall walking.
---
&gt;dont be a dick
---
Venom
---
Damn, imagine if they implemented an algorithm around the Fibonacci sequence just for some NE flips.
---
I've notice this too so i'm glad someone is bringing it up. The distance that players can see each other from is simply too small in Classic beta atm. I've linked a video, made in 2005, in a few other comments in this thread, where it's pretty clear that the view distance needs to be increased in Classic.
---
Zug zug
---
Not any pushed by players. The only changes so far are technical things that are convenient for blizzard.
---
Yep. 06 act.
---
Hi, /u/iquerohde
---
It could definitely have a level-based Diminishing Returns formula applied, and even read the correct % at any given level. Say, by level 70, a 2% crit trinket becomes .5% on the actual item.
---
Yeah that's what I remember too. Some packs had raid wide fire bursts, especially after the raid moved on from Garr's room. On Rag too we were required to get at least 80ish FR, and I think the melee had to stack more. I've heard that in Private Servers the fire damage from the trash packs was not scripted, which is why there are conflicting reports.
---
But also, I wasn't healing back then. Maybe the raid AoE is completely healable nowdays and our healers back then were just bad. But it doesn't seem like it, since we were in the top 3 guilds on the server when it came to progression and they had no issue healing much harder encounters in T2 and T2.5.
---
Yes you are right
---
It’s nice against paladins, but the dot also prevents you from trapping enemies.
---
I mean... that's the entire point of the genre since its inception. It's entirely okay to dislike ARPGS. They may not be your thing at all. As far as what the people who do enjoy it like, that is feeling badass by mass slaughtering and melting enemies. It's not about a challenge or about calculating and processing anything, it's just about mindless murder, tbh.
---
When we play WoW we do it for completely different reasons and want a completely different experience. That is why I fucking hate M+. WoW isn't Diablo and M+ doesn't belong there, imo. That doesn't mean I hate Rifts and/or Diablo, they work great in that game, just not in WoW. Two different games with two different feelings of what makes you badass.
---
got 'em!
---
I think that's one beauty of being a new player. You really get to "Build-a-bear" your character. Then, once (and if) you decide you want to be focused on raiding or pvp, you seek out the information to improve and learn what the best option is. None of us started out with a min-max build. I think anyone who tells someone how they should play randomly in the world is just a thief of joy.
---
THEN you get to change your spec and see the huge improvement in your character's damage or survivability first hand and why people use it.
---
Otherwise some people just want to be casual and fool around with builds, which is fine too.
---
Duskwood and Winterspring are great.
---
Is that also going to be in classic? I don't remember it being in old wow
---
I mean, yeah, everyone always touted every new MMO as "the WoW killer", but I always said that the only thing that can kill WoW, is WoW itself.
---
We have enough footage from the era. It wouldn't remain a secret for long.
---
It’s “personnel” dag-nabbit!
---
That’s what makes it a meme.
---
False. Wildstar is the WoW killer.
---
I wouldn't worry too much.  Most of those premade guilds who recruited a year in advance will have open spots because not everyone will play with them, level at the same speed, or desire to raid.  Plus, those types of guilds are full of clowns.
---
There will be a ton of guilds that are created in September and October.  Also, there will be plenty of PUGs that will happen, and seeing as most people work I think PUGs will be more realistic than a lot of guilds.
---
I started playing in January of 2005, was 14. Played a hunter and I was pretty average while having no idea what I was doing ha.

literally unplayable.

Thanks for having a civil discussion with me.  Its great to hear from someone in the Beta that has some real information such as population numbers.   
---
Glad to hear there are people like yourself testing the intricate parts of the game that you mentioned.   That was all my post was trying to get at , and I can concede that I could have formed my argument better.

I know what you mean, I was a troll. My first epic mount was a wolf.
---
That would be the same thing just more confusing.
---
Yeah that looks right to me. The players on the beta video definitely loaded in too slowly. 
---
I haven't experienced this myself yet so I'm wondering if it's an isolated incident or something happening consistently.
---
do you think you will buy 12 months of subscription based off playing for free in a beta version of the game that has been out less than a month?  
---
I feel like most of the people that play private servers are attracted because of the price point of free.  The fact they don't need to do anything each month other than play wow maintains the player base.  The subscription model, to me, will drive off many of the classic wow players.  In fact, I suspect classic wow will have more modern players over time, because they can hop back into classic when they are board of the new content patches from live.  They are already used to spending $15 or less a month for Warcraft.
---
Yeah, but they just abbreviate numbers into, 2.76B (for example). So it's much more manageable.
---
Is it up in an hour ? i thought it was now, are my times messed up ?
---
The only people down voting are alliance players
---
My advice is always just remember it’s a game. It’s not life or death.
---
MoP the best expansion? Idk, maybe in terms of gameplay. Or stat customization, like you said. But there were a lot of problems with MoP; mostly the fact that it was an 8 (?) year old game that already had systems and a culture that was getting out of control.
---
Numbers were out of control. MoP was the time when they said they were starting to approach the soft cap for how big numbers can get in their systems (HP, damage, etc.) and ended up having to do a stat squish in WoD. Gold was starting to get out of control.
---
Lots of controversial features too, like legendaries for everyone, LFR, etc.
---
MoP was pretty good, but I would still probably put it behind WotLK and (maybe) BC in terms of expansions. Above the rest of them IMO though.
---
Wot
---
Let me criticize those who criticize others about criticizing !!!!
---
Yeah, it really killed the leveling experience. Just felt like a broken game. Scaling tries to fix that but it's not great. For my money I'd say slow leveling way down, make mobs way more dangerous and let people who just want end game content buy level boosts.
---
This is so wrong. If you played the game as intended you'd literally be doing it wrong in the eyes of min/maxers.
---
"Why are you actually wearing your tier set and not the rogue leather you stupid fury warrior?" "Take this cloth healing piece Mr. Druid/shaman/paladin." "Luls spirit gear."
---
There are specs where the optimal dps rotation avoids several of their key abilities (namely shadow priest but there are others) and tricks you'd never learn without someone pointing it out to you, like downranking spells for mana efficiency.
---
You can have fun without knowing how to play, but you definitely don't learn to play by having fun.
---
If the burning portal is ever released Felstone can drop for example in in bwl from the warlocks forcing raiding guilds to aquire it to first of all open but also maintaining the darkportal.  
---
Then if some of the unused housing and unopenable doors in stormwind all around the world could be transformed into personal and guild housing, having a high maintenance cost that raised in time with materials that drop in many old raids. Giving out housing for opening the dark portal, top pvp rewards, high gold costs and such.   
---
Then the caverns of time can hold "heroic" versions of older instances, with a ragnaros that was not awakened too soon with some smal changes like bigger corehounds and whatnot.  
---
Also making more sense having t1 drop with frost resistance compared to crafting most of the gear, the same with bwl t2 and arcane resistance for example that could be used in a future raid.   
---
There is just so much they could have done instead of ["guess they should make an expansion of this game"](https://youtu.be/xyPzTywUBsQ?t=1733)
---
Max level SFK would be dope. Although, I bet tuning the dungeons would take a lot of trial and error, given the way tool-kits expand over from 13 or so (RFC, for instance) and 60 - not sure Bliz's keen to invest in that process. The only thing that worries me about classic BC is that it'll split the population and aggravate potentially dwindling server pops.
---
[Fetish of the Sand Reaver](http://classicdb.ch/?item=21647) was a better threat reduction trinket. 70% reduction on 3 minute cooldown, as opposed to the Eye's 35% reduction on 2 minute cooldown.
---
With a 70% threat reduction you could go full ham on AoE and not worry about pulling threat.
---
Hi, I built between 7 and 9 gearsets on my Nostalruis Druid, depending on if you count one item change as a different set.
---
If you are the tank, the courteous thing to do is pass on anything that isn't tank gear. But if you will tank, you will run a lot of dungeons (the demand is huge). If you run enough dungeons, you will see plenty of healing gear drop that the healer doesn't need. It really isn't too tough just picking up an item on the side here and there.
---
its alive in the same way that Blockbuster rental stores are alive.
---
Technically it exists, no one touches it. And those who do touch it regularly, fucking hate it
---
ye its better to enjoy the journy to 60 vanilla allows it to play it in your own paste
---
 still I'm going full no life and enjoy both leveling and endgame content
---
It's been awhile since I played ESO so I hope I'm remembering right, but a lot of ESO's gameplay focuses on exploration and quest stories, so people will run the new area for the fun of seeing the storylines. Gameplay wise, you'll see gear cosmetics that let you adjust how your haracter looks that require running the new content, or they'll have new classes or abilities tied to the expansion. Progressing in power tends to be more about sidegrading to newer elements rather than straight jacking up raw numbers.
---
whats the best talent point to spend to tank RFC on a warrior?
---
Those posts sucking Omar’s dick last week were sad and pathetic as fuck
---
It’s a nod to the classic ZX Spectrum game Jet Set Willy, staring Miner Willy.
---
You have to pick up 3 seperate items with a several minute respawn and if there is a line of people....
---
I plan on skipping it.
---
I rented Rock And Roll Racing for the Snes once in 1993. 
---
Clearly blizz hates everyone that doesn’t stream /s
---
Did you get an email or anything? or did you just get a dropdown above the play button?
---
Just food and flasks really.  I think 1.12 made the consumable change where certain types wouldn't stack, which alleviated a lot of farming for high end raids.  It's not a big deal if people aren't popping potions and food until AQ40/Naxx.  More important to farm resist gear for those it applies to.
---
They still haven't given up. Now they're all here to ruin our good time because they didn't get their way.
---
There's a severe shortage of caster mail until aq.
---
I remember when I first start playing and saw how big this world really is, I had to tell my two brothers and in just 1 hour they too bought the game and created their account just like me, such a good times.
---
But then we'd have repetitive gear.
---
"Increases chance to crit by 2% (Does not work above level 60)"
---
"Increases chance to crit by 2% (Does not work above level 70)"
---
"Increases chance to crit by 2% (Does not work above level 80)"
---
etc.
---
im the guy who looted it. lol
---
Pretty bad r14 player
---
Hopefully it’s turned on.

Hopefully Blizz and all other game devs take a hard 2nd look at Classic and learn to make MMO’s again.  
---
Before you even get to the Barrens at 11 or 12, WoW classic has already beaten competing MMO’s on quality player engagement.
---
The world needs to be big, it needs to be dangerous to venture out, not impossible.  SWTOR zones are fancy rat mazes.
---
It amazes me how many MMO’s got the basic concept flat wrong while trying to emulate it.
---
People started to dig old videos up because dungeons seemed easier than they remember. If dungeons seemed "normal" to them, nobody would bother.
---
HP numbers for a well geared tank throughout WoW (not precise, just to illustrate):
---
 - Vanilla, lvl 60: 6.000
---
 - BC, lvl 70: 12.000 (10 levels, 200% increase)
---
 - WoTLK, lvl 80: 27.500 (10 levels, 230% increase)
---
 - Cata, lvl 85: **150.000** (5 levels, 545% increase)
---
 - MoP, lvl 90: **550.000** (5 levels, 366% increase)
---
NUMBERS SQUISH 1, lvl 90: 30.000
---
 - WoD, lvl 100: **600.000** (10 levels, a **2000% increase**)
---
 - Legion, lvl 110: **9.000.000** (10 levels, 1500% increase)
---
NUMBERS SQUISH 2, lvl 110: 20.000
---
 - BfA, lvl 120: **350.000** (10 levels, 1750% increase)
---
I just don't see how anyone could think this power creep is out of control...
---
Same with raids, yes. In retail, once a new raid releases, every other raid is instantly obsolete. But in vanilla, every raid is still useful all throughout the game's life.
---
-MC you'll want to run for thunderfury / accuria / BRE
---
-BWL you'll want to run for Chromag/Nef weapons, DFT, rejuv, etc.
---
-AQ40 again for really good weapons, mostly C'thun stuff
---
-Naxx because....well it's naxx, lol, best loot in the game
---
That is deff true, and I expect to see more druids in classic. However, I don't expect to see a huge increase in druids above rank 8 in pvp. Who knows though, it's anyones guess at this point.
---
Scaling was out there because everything was one shottable and boring... 
---
They didn’t need it in classic because leveling was actually a challenge rather than a walk in the park. 
---
This is why people that shit talk about retail saying things like “leveling is such a chore” ect are gonna hate classic.
---
it is 46 min to go.
---
(9) &lt;comments making fun of people who  want to play and couldn't log in, telling them this stress test is not for playing, calling them entitled, plus other random insults&gt;
---
i said nothing about my personal opinion, just how people will inevitably react to content in 'WoW Classic' that wasn't in WoW classic
---
You need to watch this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKNgN5C4kqE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKNgN5C4kqE)
---
Feeling with you man.
---
I still remember the first time I logged into that update. I though I'd logged into a private server somehow.
---
I still don't understand what the point of it was.
---
&gt; There's still professions, reps, mounts, recipes, companion pets, titles and plenty of other things to grind. Even if you had everything that you wanted, you could still craft for profit to kill time while waiting for raids
---
There's way, waaay more to do on retail waiting for raid and people still compain the game is boring and there is nothing to do :)
---
Yeah, I get that, and how they changed their approach somewhat. But still, I think your examples don't really count.
---
Group compositions matter quite a bit in retail in 5 mans, that's why you see a meta in MDI for example.
---
On the other hand, I personally think there is no need for any group synergy for 5-10 mans in classic. You could try to optimize and shave off time, but you'll do the dungeon regardless because from my point of view, there are no difficulties to overcome. The bosses are simple, the trash is simple, you rarely need to pay attention to anything. Unless you pull too much / by accident or you're hopelessly undergeared, nothing should happen.
---
You could try to optimize the group, and WF does make fury warriors wet, but you don't need to. The feral druid is a loss in dps "no matter" how many profit from the crit bonus, same goes for moonkin aura. You don't want any shaman, you want a resto shaman for WF / totems in general. You don't want a SPriest, you want some hybrid who heals and keeps the dot up with SW:P.
---
In terms of class / spec diversity, classic is pretty bad IMO. Depending on the definiton of uniqueness / class identity, it may be better than retail but I fail to see how it does much good.
---
It's cool for that one guy who absolutely loves his niche role and sucks for many others. That's atleast what I gathered from the official forums back in the day and ingame talk.
---
But it's a spicy topic and questioning stuff here always ends in some form of shitstorm sadly.
---
Nice, we're practically account twins lol. Gotta get 'em started early.
---
For all of the jerk things I have done that I either regret or don't regret... telling people how to play was simply not one of those things, at least unsolicited.
---
Not everyone is dumb
---
It really depends on what your doing.
---
Boars seemed good with the charge to put a stutter in your enemies step, but that left their focus dumped and pretty much useless after that.
---
Bats are good because their huge wingspan following behind a player can block a chunk of camera space. In battle grounds, they  were the pet most likely to be killed, It was constant rezz cycle with them.
---
Flying serpents were situational good because some spit spit from a distance, so if your working the backfield your pet stays out of harms way. However in practice, they were very glitchy, hard to get them to engage at all in mobile combat.
---
Cats with prowl are good if your a night elf. Agressive pet, prowling on stay next to the flag with dash,  ready to go,  However many people managed to escape, because the pet wants to land the first strike from stealth.
---
Spiders seemed good with web to root people seemed nice but  spiders had a hard time closing the distance to get in range. (I think the webs came later, vanilla just had spiders with poison I think)
---
I'm not ribcabin, but I do wish we were getting to see 1.0 instead of 1.12. We'd get to see all the changes and exploits, T2 dropping in MC with lvl40 dungeon gear models, one single person maybe getting a legendary necklace, etc. etc.
---
The idea of recreating the patch progression sounds fun.
---
... wtf stupid
---
the issue with the stat squishes is that blizzard is unable to not ramp things up instantly once they have done one. squish stats down to 4k dps by the end of the exp we are looking at 50k.
---
this is by design as with each new raid tier the previous raid tier needs to be totally nullified for some reason it is bad design to me and gives WoW this unhealthy thinking of "didn't get on when a new patch droped so i might aswell wait for the next one before i resub"
---
lol wut? Dragonstalker and crypstalker are some of the nicest sets in the game
---
Play something else?
---
as I recall end bosses of dungeons were bumped up a bit higher to provide that artificial level of difficulty.  The extra misses, crushing blows, and dodges made it a longer durability affair than the prior bosses and trash.  what level is arugal anyways?  
---
anyways,  I tried to be within 3 levels of the end boss or 4 if I had just trained new levels of core dps or healing spells.  The tank was the most important level to party with. A low level tank meant the non plate or mail classes were taking a majority of the damage and heals.
---
Right
---
I get off at the same time the stress test goes live
---
So ideally i'll be able tovget on after the first wave of not being able to log in is over
---
You can do it maybe 1-2 months into MC, then your main tank is geared enough to switch. With a good guild 1month should be fine.
---
EDIT: this is on pservers, might not be accurate for vanilla. Source: I'm a tank
---
Depends on how you define relevant, I guess.
---
 New content in ESO usually adds a few things: 
---
1) More skill points to acquire and spend.  There usually are not many added, but when your character wants to do PvE, PvP, Stealth (Thieves Guild &amp; Dark Brotherhood), and Crafting; you need all the skill points you can get.  (Note: in ESO, the passive and active abilities you have available to slot need to have skill points spent in them.  The more you have, the easier it is to change up your character on the fly without needing to respec.  Respeccing, while not expensive for most max-level players, is tedious and inconvenient)
---
2) More gear sets:  Gearing up in ESO is all about set items.  Non-set gear is trash for everyone except new players (and it is for them too, but they usually dont have another option unless they have crafter friends).  The level of the gear didnt really change its power, but instead, lost power as you outleveled it.  A level 10 player with level 10 gear would have the same stats and power as a max level character, when not considering skill point investments or Champion Points.  Gear progression in ESO is more horizontal than vertical, where the newly-introduced gear isnt really any better than what previoisly existed, but rather just provides different options.  Most of my time getting gear on ESO was spent on finding different sets to try different builds and play styles (for PvP, generally).  Generally, gear choices in ESO were about getting an ideal balance of damage/survivability/resource sustain (for PvP), or for min-maxing your role (for PvE).
---
3) New story, quests, and lore.  This is pretty self-explanatory.  The storylines are actually pretty interesting and well written, in my opinion, so this is a large draw for a number of players.
---
4) New gear styles to acquire and apply to your own character.  There are tons of different armor and clothing styles, with many players spending a ton of time acquiring those styles to make their character look "perfect".
---
So. Much. This.
---
now 45 minutes from this post
---
There will be multiple morphing programs anyway just like in retail.
---
Dude I’ve been BURNING out of my mind in WSG. FeelsGreatMan
---
oof the duells ooof xDD
---
T1 is kinda ugly but T2 is god tier. Ditto for T3.
---
Between Dartol's Rod of Transformation (breaks on damage, alliance only), Noggenfoggers and Deviate Delights, you have plenty of options to hide the way you look.
---
I fail to see a problem with that
---
Honestly just kiting with hunter might be viable.
---
RESULTS - https://www.surveymonkey.com/stories/SM-QHKXV28V/
---
Both tauren and undead are terrible warrior races
---
&gt; Anthem was hyped, Division 2 was hyped, and they both had the numbers and the interest up to, and at launch. Now Division 2 is bleeding players, and Anthem is belly up.
---
This is a laughable comparison.  I think you'll see in the coming months what the difference is.
---
My mans forgot about Tanaris. Sands, Pirates, Golblin town, insect invaders, all served with two heaping scoops of murder. My list
---
1. Barrens, Barrens is just cool. From the quill boar, the oasis and the Kaulker it's all love. Wait wut Pirates too? And Raptors? Delish.
---
2. Tanaris, for the above stated reasons.
---
3. STV, Every one knows about Nam. white sand beaches lol. Wait, those are bones...
---
4. Ungoro Crater, DINOSAURS!!!!!!!!!
---
5. Hillsbrad, a good primer for Nam. The theme is also cool and creepy. Yeti cave is also cool as hell.
---
You mean like we do now?
---
Primary stat
---
Stamina
---
&lt;random secondary stat&gt;
---
Wow ... that was truly awful! I love it &lt;3
---
My head hurts listening to a minute of my life being wasted.
---
&gt;Now with Classic, its back to remembering, embracing, or experiencing those original, first, new and amazing feelings that we can still reminisce about. That first Epic or Legendary quest item. The thrill of entering a new dungeon or raid. That first Ragnaros, Onyxia or Nefarion kill. The feeling of completing a set bonus. The feeling of getting that one item you been farming for weeks on end. The list can go on. Try to think back when the game first gave you the chills or made you feel some sort of way. For me, it was enter Ragefire Chasm and going down the tunnel and hearing the epic music that plays; thinking to myself, this is sooooo cool!
---
The problem with this is that we aren't noobs anymore.  The beauty of not knowing how to play and therefore, everything is great notion won't be there.  The play through on my first level 60 toon was different from my 2nd, and from my 3rd.  This is what a lot of people aren't remembering about vanilla.  That after your first go around, your alts didn't have quite the same feel.  This time around, we are all play alts.
---
Sure, nostalgia will still be there.  But this time around, most people will know where to go, what instances to do, what to skip, how to farm, what to farm, and how to gear.  
---
On my first play through, I remember running SFK, SM, Maradon, etc with 4 players without a healer and tank... wiping and running back every other pull, etc.  My 2nd play through - groups didn't form unless we had 5 with healer and tank.  My 3rd play though?  Couldn't even find people to do most of the low level stuff with.  At that point, it was all about suiting up to do raids.
---
Nostaglia?  Yes of course.  But the experience?  It won't be the same because it can't be. We know how to play this time around and will most others.  This time around, we all know exactly where Mankirk's Wife is.
---
Crypt is okayish but I'll never get that most likely.  Dragons shoulders are just too much for me, and its colors suck.
---
I think its a good thing they are opening them earlier. It should allow for the rush of people not working to meet with those getting off work (if my assumption of 8-5/9-5 crowd is correct) 
---
But even if it fails I can try around 6pm CST and prolly be ok.
---
Literal god
---
Is there a stress test today?
---
I lawl’d along with my soul. Thanks for that.
---
Oh I could use some 3rd party thing, isn't that against ToS though?
---
Agreed. The stats we have in modern wow are ridiculous, and mean absolutely nothing. The crazy health and stat jumps when you get close to max make all prior power gains feel completely hollow and meaningless.
---
Awesome, happy for you man. Depression is fucking awful.
---
Remember racials is not main priority
---
The fact of the matter is that blizzard has already address this bug before a couple times
---
It doesnt help to spam post instances of it happening
---
I just want thottbot back.
---
Coming from someone who’s run a Guild for a couple years before:
---
1) Make sure that you have a vision for what you want to do with the guild. 
---
2) Find people who share that vision and are willing to help you achieve it. Then have them help you as officers. 
---
3) Recruit members who share your vision as well and make sure you actively pursue said vision with them. 
---
Honestly Guilds come in many flavors and with many different goals. The important thing is to be knowledgeable and always keep pushing your goal forward. Just remember to have fun while you’re doing it and do your best to ensure that the Guild itself is active.
---
Everything is ugly in classic
---
Oh sure looking like a furbolg is much better lol.  Good suggestions though.
---
I'd play something other than Hunter.
---
Or carry around a bag of your fashionable gear that you prefer and swap to it when you're vogue'ing in Orgrimmar or whatever it is you're into.
---
What was especially crazy to me in WoD and Legion was how insane your HP and damage inflation was from when you first hit the level cap to the time you were into the second mythic raid tier. it was absolutely astonishing
---
Yes, exactly what retail has. And I hate it.
---
You should have seen that server on launch. There were so many people you couldn’t quest half the quests. The best thing for leveling was to find one mob and just kill it over and over again. The dynamic respawns were turned up so high the mob would respawn like 5-6 seconds after you killed it. It wasn’t until I was like level 35+ that the zones didn’t feel insanely cramped. It was insane, but was so easy getting pre-bis geared even as a rogue I just was able to get in a group any time I wanted.
---
&gt;Hunter - Scatter -&gt; Trap -&gt; Kite
---
You mean Scatter -&gt; FD -&gt; Trap -&gt; Kite.
---
Scatter stops combat it does not put you out of combat.
---
I have nothing against classic, I just have something against the super zealous vanilla lovers who spew dumb bullshit
---
Once Mangle came out with 2.0 BC talent points Feral Druids became such a cool PvP spec to play ... Too bad in 1.12 they're not even close, sadly, and playing feral implies spending most of your time in Bear to avoid getting three shotted by virtually anything with decent gear. BC, starting with this prepatch, was really a blessing for druids.
---
All the gear in that game is part of a set. So you have people making builds that involve old sets, new sets, mixed sets, and lots of people have fun making weird niche and hybrid builds. There is a meta, but it's not quite as strict in some ways compared to how WoW players treat the meta.
---
All these gear sets drop from activites all over the world. Some are crafted, drop from overland bosses, or raids from all over.
---
New content will sometimes include new skill trees (skills work differently in ESO; you can learn pretty much everything but only equip a fraction of them, but can change it out of combat freely).
---
Their most recent xpac introduced a new class, and because of how leveling works in ESO, it's not a bother to have alts. There's a lot of investment in Mains, but after you hit the level cap you gain CP (Champion Points) which give you points to put into skill trees that give you passive buffs and your CP level is account bound.
---
But mostly, people play the new content because it's actually fun to do open world stuff in that game for a whole bunch of reasons I won't further bloat this comment with. There's gear incentives too of course, but because gear and your character's level are not treated as this ever increasing ladder of arbitrary numbers, old content is never made irrelevant. 
---
The decision to equip a new piece of gear isn't:  what it's item level; how does it sim? It's more about the player asking themself, "what could I do with these set bonuses if I combined it with this other set bonus and these particular skills".
---
Basically, it's an RPG. People still measure DPS but it's not surrounded by the same attitude as it is in WoW because you have very few meaningful choices in WoW, which leaves mostly numerical upgrades.
---
Im strictly speaking from looks and animations, not racials. Do you like Human Female or Male and Tauren Female or Male?

I agree. In fact, I enjoy BFA as a one time experience. I like the story, the art and music are amazing, I think that Battle of Dazar'alor was a great raid...  It just cant hold the players. I really think that gear obsolence has to go if they want to have any sort of meaningful character progression. It's a bit weird, but our brain feels more rewarded when it gets a big reward for repeating a task than getting a "consolation prize" for every attemp and when you finally get that perfect titanforge roll, the feeling of reward goes away as soon as you realize it's the same thing you already had with a 2% increase in stats.
---
As warlock - pop his CD - die. Then respawn and start gank him. After lvl 41 soul link I will be not afraid anymore. Untill then do not 3xp in STV
---
It affects PvP, with transmog you can't visually identify gear on enemy players. In Vanilla, if you see a Warrior with BRE running around you know to stay the hell away. If he jsut has Arcanite Reaper, then that's a completely different ball game.
---
Yeah tier 1 is the most hideous thing...  People seem to like 2 but the shoulders are way over your head and the colors are very un-huntery.
---
RFC maybe, but itd be tough
---
Original vanilla, yes. This frankensteined ezmode version with 16 debut alots, 1.12 class talents, and buffed itemization....not so much.
---
Oh really?  That changes everything.
---
Guess its worth doing then.
---
Im strictly speaking from a looks and animations perspective, not racials
---
I’ve seen this point in several threads and, while I agree, I do think it comes down to the environment they put themselves in. 
---
Some random grouping for quests?  Yea, don’t be a dick.
---
Trying to push server firsts?  Yea.. you’re going to get told that your hybrid ret/holy or enh/resto build is shit and you need to change it.
---
In the latter example though, you’d knowingly put yourself in that environment so if you aren’t ready for it, that’s on you.
---
I am methodically completing every single Alliance quest in the Beta at the appropriate level, recording experience, reputation and spillover reputation values for each quest in my quest completionist guide (https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm) as I go. After comparing a few known quests to values in those databases, it appears that Wowhead Classic lists the most accurate values for experience and reputation. I’m not aware of any resource aside from my guide that tracks spillover reputation so I couldn’t compare that. Some quests give 25% spillover rep, but most of the starter zone quests do not.
---
62! = 3.1469973e+85
---
Weird I am always jealous of the hunters since they have some good sets imo. Difference of opinion I guess
---
From my experience with the beta, ClassicDB and/or Twinstar are better IMO. More accurate info, less garbage on the site. Half the damn page on Wowhead is adds.
---
Upvoted for visibility.
---
Playing on Private Servers can be great window into what that hostility is like, everyone expects everyone to already know everything, so when you don’t know something, you’re probably getting kicked from the group instead of educated. 
---
Hopefully everyone who sees this remembers that 90% of what we loved about Vanilla was community driven, after all that’s what half the posts in this sub reference.
---
patches and expansions "trivialized" old content to make money for the game company.  if you as the customer are not buying a new subscription or expansion pack, the company cannot sustain to keep a customer support staff, artists or game developers employed.  seems like a good idea to have a video game as a service to keep your employee's on time for their house payments.
---
I mean is it any different now lol? Im sure plenty of gear is numerically identical to what has been before, pre stat-squish. Numbers wise we've even regressed multiple times lmao
---
Honestly, most "Vanilla raiding vets" here are private server players. No lie. We saw how well that shit went when they were all crying about how inaccurate demo/beta was and it turns out all the private servers were overtuned and they didn't know shit. I'm not exaggerating when I say this, but less than 2% of the population actually did raid progression, it may literally be closer to 1% and it was just 2% or so that actually COMPLETED them at all during vanilla.
---
Progression raiders kept their shit secret and didn't stream. All the guys doing hard calculations and actually TESTED their theorycrafts in raids kept their secrets. Even most of the videos where a guild posted their raid kill video, it was heavily edited and mostly just showed a bunch of jump cuts and the last few %. You didn't really get to see much of their strat because they didn't want you to. They wanted to be the only ones that could so shit.
---
Only second rate theorycrafters and players actually posted their builds and shit for the few people who bothered to actually look up. Info was hard to come by, the online databases were either shit or filled with spyware and all the brady guides were... well, fucking brady guides, so they were useless. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that 90% of people didn't know shit, 8% of people were barely competent by today's standards and less than 2% were actually good.
---
I'd like to think I'm in the 8%, because I at least tried to look up and follow guides, but honestly I just ran twink PvP back in vanilla and TBC, so I was probably just as dumb as everyone else when it came to the PvE shit, but I also didn't go around saying otherwise. A lot of people in here came off looking pretty dumb when Blizzard confirmed they were wrong.
---
Correct me if wrong but I think Gnome is really good for intellect bonus so you can get quick weapon skill at max lvl when suddenly change to onehand + shield
---
I think the social aspect has to be there because of how difficult it is to solo some of the content. Reaching out for help is a must since theres no addon to just throw you into a group for random X quest
---
I spend a lot of time around this subreddit selling Druid to people, but Hunter is actually my 2nd favorite class, and I plan to roll both on classic. For solo and/or casual content, I would probably recommend Hunter. The effort investment for hunter to raid is very low, and soloing DM N (not in phase 1) is extremely high profit and in my opinion a very chill, zen experience to do when just messing around.
---
Druid is extremely fun, and I love it because it is a high effort-high reward class, but that's exactly why I roll a hunter alt: low effort, chlll zen time that farms beaucou bucks.
---
I find the way the furbolg's arms flap around when they run to be pretty hilarious. You asked for ways to alter your character's appearance. I also forgot Orb of Deception, but that's a what, 5m duration on a 30m or 60m CD and also takes a trinket slot.
---
Just come to terms that you'll look like a clown for most of leveling and early raiding regardless. T1 doesn't look too bad if you hide the helm also.
---
Or fear if you ran into him in a bg
---
I.e., two full raids marching on org/sw/if and defenders form their own raids. all of a sudden layering happens leaving one side at a massive disadvantage.
---
Yeah i noticed their animations being very good, especially the 2hander and it made me put them high up on the list
---
Also they are pretty rare in the world
---
Are you okay?
---
11/12/2006, I barely slid in before TBC, but I was never max level or endgame until Wrath regardless.
---
At least you will have a set to wear, unlike almost every other class where the sets are shit.
---
its a symptom of having four different raid difficulties and mythic+
---
stats just spiral out of control patch after patch
---
They serve different healing functions in raids. Neither is better. I'd familiarize yourself with both their rolls and decide.
---
I do think the pally has alot of potential in pvp than a healing priest. They live a lot longer.
---
What do you mean?
---
full t2 orc hunter with purple beard and barb of the sand reaver is gang shit
---
I will agree with most of what you said. 
---
The true tryhards and good players in vanilla were not those who executed fights perfectly, that was the easy part. The preparation and the farming needed to get to the level required for the later part of AQ40 and onwards was just surreal, and not something anyone could easily commit to. The true difficulty of vanilla was the logistics.
---
Things were harder in a difference sense, but now most gamers will just look on how complex the encounter is, because this is how retail WoW and Mythic raiding has trained its audience. It's also why I don't think people will blow through MC on week 2 wearing greens and with 20 Fire Res. The numbers for the encounter will simply not add up, no amount of player skill will make any difference if the tank can soak only 5k damage and not the whole 6k that Rag does with his attacks (pulling those numbers out of my ass, as an example). There's a reason why certain bosses were considered "Guild Breakers", and all of them were gear checks.
---
But then again, I cannot discount the experience people have gained over all these years. When I first stepped in MC I was a complete newbie on my first MMO. The fact that most of us will not be clueless will severely ease up on the requirements to complete the encounters.
---
Double Rogue
---
Double Mage
---
and Double Hunters
---
I did actually play when they launched *a particular server* and it was just a clusterfuck, but fun nonetheless. I think Blizzard did  make some notes of that and got ideas on how to tackle this with Classic. We may actually take layering and dynamic spawns for granted, but only up to a point!
---
I literally thought classic was going to be the worst thing done by blizzard in a long time because while I had fond memories of it I also had bad memories of it. I got beta invited thought why not and now know I missed what I did meaning something and making friends in an online world.
---
Tauren have that extra wide hit box, War Stomp, 5% total HP, and that 10 Nature Resist that helps in AQ.
---
Undead have WotF for Warlocks and Priest PVP and Cannibalize for leveling.
---
Both are better than Troll.
---
Ohh, I see! I would probably stick with the 40ish level dungeons then and vendor the items. Anything in the 50+ would probably be too difficult or time consuming to be worth it without a third-box for dps.
---
&gt;lol
---
&gt;lmao
---
Not sure what's so funny about my post.
---
Yes, vanilla gear IS different than retail gear, it's not just "main stat, stamina, 2 ratings" on literally every piece of gear like retail.
---
That is one of the things ESO got horribly wrong.
---
Yeah, if I came off as sarcastic I didn't mean to, I definitely forgot about those.  I'll probably end up playing something else.
---
The enlightened mind of a freshman year CS student
---
Raid DM with fishing poles! Its totally doable
---
And if you dont like pushing ladders/leadboards..? Guess you're fucked then lol
---
Female or Male? Im playing a Male Orc on Pserver atm and their animations are super wack to me, like one of the worst races, Female Orc is alot better tbh
---
You literally just said you hope that the player base drops by 75%... Meaning you want it to fail...
---
I was just thinking about this the other day. When I got my Carrot on a Stick I felt so accomplished. Even that little boost made a huge difference.
---
It isn't though.
---
Oh, I guess that explains why the dragon disappeared. Must be because someone got invited and the layer as a result changed (but why would the layer change when someone's getting invited? Max players reached...? And why did both the Horde and Alliance teams get shifted?)
---
Yeah, because choosing a partner for life based on looks always plays out well. :-P
---
Dude same here
---
I have yet to see a single game use infinite scaling in a positive way. It always makes the game worse, or more often than not; ruins it completely.
---
it was a fucking snooze.  and if there wasn't 8 players with aqua quintessence ready to go that was the worst afk break ever.  may as well call the raid for the night after sulfuron or golemagg.
---
technically yes, however blizzard has never banned anyone for using them on retail and people have been using them since the original vanilla.
---
Warlock or shadow priest
---
Beastmaster and Dragonstalker were two of my favorite vanilla sets.
---
No thanks. There’s clearly wrong ways to play the game and I will tell those players they are playing wrong.
---
So definitely not working as intended then
---
Is it possible to bring a raid group into a dungeon? I seem to recall you could in vanilla or maybe it was in beta or an early patch
---
I believe the main reason was that with the world quest setup, they needed all the zones from the current expansion to be max level when you were eligible for WQs
---
It is and people have been banned for it
---
Don’t be a jerk but find a nice way of pointing people in the right direction. Lots of prefacing “play how you want dude but...” Wheatons Law for sure but being constructive to uninformed players is the nice thing to do. 
---
You can lead a horse to water. Just don’t poor it down his neck and call him a doofus.
---
Yea it is a shame that dire maul blues will smoke a lot of raid gear, other than that agreed
---
If you don't think there's a handful of nerds wanting to make sure Blizzard gets everything right and will make a loud fuss when they find out Blizzard intentionally changed something, you're mistaken. There were just as many people digging up old videos to prove Blizzard right as there were that wanted to prove Blizzard wrong.
---
Noob question here, do u need sub to get to the stress test? And how do i know if im in the test?
---
No one knows what normal is because they haven’t played the game in over 10 years. They are judging it off private servers, which have been shown to have the wrong numbers in many places.
---
And if you're already doing scaling, yeah, it might make sense to do it at lower levels for that purpose. 
---
Haven't leveled a character since then, so I don't know
---
Me neither. I'd love for it to be 8 slots. Or that bosses be buffed. I'm no changes aswell.
---
I’m just worried about the private server crowd.  I don’t really want to play with people who know the whole game inside and out... a huge part of the “fun” in classic was how ignorant we all were.  We will have a lot of people who just rush to 60 and become whining  “elitists”.   Would be a lot more fun if everyone was coming in fresh again; with only memories of playing classic back in the day.  I’m not a new player; I played classic up to tier 3 and tbc(I was the second mage on my server to get full tier 2).  But I haven’t played in a decade so I probably won’t remember a lot of the game, which should be fun if the community isn’t completely cancerous now.
---
Are you sure they are ok with it?
---
If you're looking for a cut and dry answer, Priest is slightly better at PvE and Pally is slightly better for PvP. Priest has a more robust bag of healing spells, pally has only a few healing spells but many many support spells. Priest requires attentiveness to mana, pally is more forgiving and is the best healer for mana retention and efficiency.
---
I guess it depends on the revenue they're going to generating from it, I unsubscribed from BFA a few months ago, but because I'll be getting classic and regular WoW for $15 chances are I'll wind up playing the new BFA patches as they come out as a break from classic. Especially if they are timing the content releases to be in between content lulls for one or the other. 
---
Also it depends on what a "healthy" population is, I'm sure this game will be able to maintain a few tens of thousand players for the foreseeable future, but can the game be functional with only a thousand players on each faction? Probably, and that's $30k a month, more than enough to run a single server. Once classic hits its final patch they're going to need less than a skeleton crew to maintain it. The raiding community might move on after a full clear but I think the PvPers will remain, there's a reason people still twink. 
---
Ultimately I think the biggest threat to the game population would be the conclusion of retail WoW and it being replaced with a sequel that completely overhauls the game engine and mechanics to bring it into the 2020s and beyond. If a sequel hits the nail on the head and is able to maintain those RPG elements, class identity, sense of progression, and community and the only "unique" feature to classic is nostalgia then that would be the nail in the coffin. Until that product is on the market there will always be a consistent player base.
---
Well, it will. I was in the future, man. You can believe my words, words don't lie.
---
I was thinking maradon princess runs. If i tri-box a dps, i might as well.... Quint-box tank, healer, 3 dps ;)
---
Extra 2 yards of melee range &gt; 1/4 chance at resisting a stun. 
---
Tauren warriors will rule PvP.
---
Yes, an email.
---
It takes only your own faction! Here is how this add-on works :
---
It automatically types */who* from time to time while you casually play (I'd say twice per hour) and collects some data there. During this datamining, Census spots the characters it hasn't seen before and adds them into a classifying graph. 
---
On this graph, you can see the raw global class distribution, the class distribution by level, the race distribution, the race distribution by level, etc etc etc.
---
2 yards is 1.83 meters
---
Nice, thanks for the reply.
---
If we're talking min/max Troll and Orc for pve Tanks actually because of TPS and for DPS Troll does the most damage after AQ40/early Naxx
---
PvP is more subjective
---
But this is not my main concern, animations and looks are
---
Dungeons are by no means easy in vanilla. You cant faceroll sungeons. A group of 4 mobs will wreck your group unless you are highly overgeared, unless you CC 1 or 2.
---
Not that its hard if you know what to do but mobs certainly dont lack damage
---
Hey dude!  So whats the rep looking like at 30?  If wowhead classic is most accurate. Its looking like its definitely not possible?  Amazing guide btw  love the spreadsheets
---
congratulations, but you’re talking to someone who also runs a business (part owner). so no, I doubt that. lmao.
---
and what the hell does you owning a business have to do with this conversation? absolutely nothing.
---
Evercrack. Wowcrack. It's all crack.
---
You are absolutely insane if you think people are not better now.
---
Yes. Always exited to see my first 50 hit damage, then at 100 it's like omg 3 numbers. Then 500 crit with frostbolt, 1000, etc. That's one thing I like about classic, when you are raiding or doing PvE content, you have the time to actually look at the numbers. I feel in retail there is so much mechanics to dodge, so many things to keep track of, trying to have the perfect rotation, you end up almost only looking at your action bars/procs while everything else is in your peripherical vision.
---
That's why I loved playing my mage back in vanilla. Yes spamming frostbolt is not the most interesting rotation, but it was very laid back and I could enjoy seeing my numbers, bosses animations, other casters casting besides me (loved that shit).
---
That doesn't change the sentiment of "I remembered this happening", when it confirms it happened.
---
Whether it's intended for classic isn't and wasn't my point.
---
Yeah but while some things could be attributed to Ion, id make the argument that there was a ton of fundamental problems with WoW dating all the way back to BC
---
Know of a way to get these added to windows 10? So I can use them in other places?
---
17.
---
My buddy and I, Hunter and Rogue, two manned Deadmines to the Van Cleef, without even knowing we were in an instance, or what an instances was!   Now we were pretty good at the game, and pretty patient, but to be able to be level equal, without a healer and a tank, and take bosses down?  Yeah, those are easy dungeons.
---
Paladin for support 
---
Priest for straight up heals. 
---
Priest can both dispell and purge
---
Paladin can dispell, and has a lot more buffs. Freedom being one of the best, since it Will save you globals on dispelling chain snares. 
---
Prisets are less mana effective, but have a larger arsenal of heals + and absorb 
---
Paladins really only have two heals, Big Boi and Fast Boi. (Could add Holy shock - but i wont be using it) 
---
But paladins have the mana Return on crit, could lead to a seeming infinite mana pool. 
---
Paladins are also the designated tank healer since they have best single target heals.
---
Preist is abit more versatile in how the heal since they can aoe, single and absorb heal. 
---
Prisets Will be able to do abit more damage in pvp.  Mind Blast, smite, SW:P and Mana Burn.
---
Paladins Will instead increase the damage others do while focusing on healing (perhaps stunning key moments with HOJ) 
---
In this way: paladins are the ultimate defensive and support class. While preist can be abit more offensive - but have a care for sudden bursts when doing so. 
---
Personally in going paladin. Freedom, Mount, Plate, Shield and solo AOE farming.
---
Edit: you cant go wrong. Both are insanely good and everyone Will want both.  Choose what seems thematically more appealing to you.  Crusader or Child molester.
---
This is so wrong lol. Thinking the diablo franchise had anything to do with mindless killing of monsters is exactly why diablo 3 ended up being the failure it is.   
---
Diablo 2 (I guess that is the mother of all ARPGs, the original was much further away from what we have today) was more about the loot than the killing. Loot is why you kill stuff. Fun loot = fun slaying. D3 has no meaningful loot or any real itemization at all, hence why killing monsters feels so incredibly repetetive and boring in that game.
---
Wrekt
---
Sounds like he's doing God's work.
---
Down voting bc streamer is bad
---
And whirlwind.
---
May as well add flying if we’re changing slots.
---
most private servers make same faction griefing in this manner bannable, since you can't ever stop them from doing it. hopefully Blizz will do the same on classic.
---
enemy faction griefing is fine, you can prevent it by having a dedicated pvp group to enforce a perimeter and keep them from getting too close to Kazzak.
---
Yes. Because everyone shares the same opinion.
---
Remember in the older diablo games you were an adventurer just like in WoW, and it felt great just like in WoW. The chosen one shtick is so god damn boring, no wonder D3 is dead lol
---
Amen brother.
---
Yeah that's what i'm doing in the beta. Leveled to 75 on the lockpick quest and after just from boxes from a opener macro. Like /cast Pick Pocket /cast Cheap Shot
---
People need to stop comparing Legion as if the mechanics and game design were SO different to BFA. If anything Legion took the game design philosophy that is killing WoW and took it to defcon 5. Everything you listed was debuted in Legion, I could go on and on...
---
Blind and Gouge are pretty terrible in world pvp where AOE's are getting thrown around a lot.
---
Word. The difference from elder scrolls 3 and elder scrolls 4 in this regard was so drastic that questing in oblivion became boring very fast. I’ve felt the same with wow for quite some time.
---
Besides the fact that 16 debuffs isn't even a change because it existed in 1.12.1, people in favor of changes are totally strawmanning this arguement.
---
Yes, Blizzard have made changes. They have made them because they ***need*** to. They need to make certain changes to run the game in a way that suits them - which isn't unreasonable, because at the end of the day they're a company and have to maintain some standard of operations.
---
People use this to say "Oh, well, they've already made ***some*** changes, so why don't we just put in transmogging, guild banks, LFR .... etc etc." or what have you. This is a complete strawman, because these QoL changes are in no way necessary for Blizzard to operate the game and serve solely to appease some people's interests.
---
25 sec  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
It was equivalent to like 1.6 points in Master of Deception.
---
I’ve been thinking the same thing for years now.
---
what are the chances this might be bannable tho?
---
I enjoyed the class hall aspect of legion and things like the mage tower, but the legendaries ruined it for me. BiS items that are completely fucking random, no rhyme or reason to how, why or where they can drop..
---
Well going from 90 to 100 doesn't feel as good as going from 9 to 10.
---
I'd have to disagree
---

---
The boots were exalted with Khorium Brotherhood, right? That was a grind I never finished haha.
---
It was 16 slots in 1.12. We're playing 1.12. That's #nochanges.
---
Well, I know a game called Beta for Azeroth with unfixed sharding problems like this one. Have you heard about it? It was released in August 2018.
---
Do you think this mentality will remain in classic? Or perhaps will it be impossible.
---
I have an active sub, with stress test.
---
When you're in the battlenet launcher, click the drop box above the big blue ''PLAY'' button, if you see ''Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic'', you're either in the Classic Beta and/or Stress Test.
---
You didn't see the youtube video? Things are going 33% faster than normally. Just look how fast does buffs count down.
---
I look forward to standing on top of the mailbox in my epic mount with my glowy weapon on my back, looking down at all the plebs clicking on me to inspect.
---
by the time you get to wear tier gear, you will think they're the best looking armor in the game. after wearing quet greens and maybe even tier 0, that tier 1 will be looking fire.
---
vanilla gear was, for the most part, *fucking ugly*. but god damn did they look good when you knew the guy wearing it was a super badass who could probably 1-shot you.
---
and that's the magic of vanilla wow.
---
Old School Runescape has a beautiful solution to this in the form of community polls. Any changes the devs come up with are presented to the players, who vote on whether each change should be implemented. It takes 75% yes votes for a change to be implemented, so things only get changed if almost everyone agrees they are good changes.
---
4 STRENGTH 4 STAM LEATHER BELT? LEVEL 18? AHHHH UHHHH.
---
Honestly scaling probably wouldve worked better if it was only for certain level zones, like Westfall only scales between 11-20.
---
&gt; In BfA you actually get weaker, relatively, when you reach 120.
---
And the way it is now, you can triple your HP (not sure about DPS increase, but triple wouldn't be surprising) after hitting 120 in a couple of days through WQs if you get a little lucky (not with titanforging, just with having gear rewards)
---
I’ve been debating getting my wife involved for classic.  I think I’ve decided it’s a terrible idea.  Remember those news stories of couples letting their children die while they played wow? That, and my brother has a girlfriend who does nothing but play Wow.  Even after he quit, she was stuck in that chair.  Getting fatter while he works his butt off at 2 jobs to pay for everything they have.  It’s too risky of an addiction, even if I have fond memories of it and want to share
---
That's great. My druid got Goblin Smasher just 1h before Stress Test ended so now I will actually get to use it :D
---
Paladin is better if you have engineering and things like sleep dust in 5 man cuz of mana efficiency. Less cc than priest tho
---
The worse your group is the better priest is tho. Mind control can be abused but generally it just slows you down if you're in a good group. Really helps if you're struggling tho. They also have shackle as a nice CC
---
In 40 man paladin always king no matter what. Just so much more mana efficient. Which is what vanilla healing is alllll about. Also better oh shit buttons.
---
Paladins can heal all the content...So they have enough HPS for all 5 mans.
---
You wouldn't pvp\* without priests....But once paladins got 15 minute buffs they went from mediocre support to S tier. Priests are alliances only offensive dispel, so you bring them but it's for buffs/offensive dispel/mana burn/mind control. 
---
And paired with a paladin priests gain a lot more than a paladin does. So there is really good synergy there. Paladin can keep you out of cc and give you conc aura.
---
I had this exact feeling with exactly argent dawn! Glad I’m not the only one
---
&gt; earned accomplishments
---
??    
---
You can clear MC with half of your raid lvl 58 in leveling greens.    
---
Best PVP gear is gained by spamming BG.
---
There is no hard content, no challenge, you guys just prefer the mindless boring grind over actually playing.
---
Just like people that complain about titanforging when they spam normal / heroic raid praying for a +20proc when they would get better gear if they actually cleared boss in mythic difficulty.
---
hydraxian rep / quintessence chain. -&gt; pre-bis + consumes (fire pots and elixirs, black lotus) -&gt; ony attune
---
It's just a slow death that's all. Ignore the fact that wildstar doesn't exist anymore, it's all just a ruse.
---
Ok?
---
Then you need to be a red haired ugly ass dwarf. It's best warrior classic has to offer on ally side. Dainty ass knife ears need not apply. Dwarf is Alliance master race. This is known.
---
But what's after Octillion? Novillion? Sounds like an ice cream flavour.
---
This is going to lead to partial groups not inviting people during an attempt to kill a named NPC for quests. Fucking BlizzAss and their sharding/layering...
---
Water Totem quest would like to have a word with you.
---
Lol I know you said in general but getting my water totem is going to be put off for a bit
---
The Alliance badge really completes it
---
That logic doesnt apply when raids are closed when they were open in 1.12..........
---
Okay? Literally no one is saying it's good. Who are you even arguing with? Haha
---
Priest by far because Horde doesn't have Palys. Don't go Alliance you scum.
---
Oh, if they implement AV in its older form, it will certainly enable epic battle.
---
from the interviews and lawyer speak the team gives, layering will be in until phase two opens up the world bosses.  Giving plenty of time for the servers to decline in population and level groups to spread out.  
---
Being on tichondrius during prime time for the whole launch week in BFA was a nightmare.  I am glad they are going to implement layering for the first few months of wow classic to at worst have the bad experience we had during prime time for launch week.  If it gets to classic wow patch day madness or thanksgiving break, that will be bringing up memories of classic and error 37.

&gt;it was, but the slower weaps still have higher dmg so every instant has that much extra damage, it just no longer has a better multiplier for AP contributions.  
---
&gt;So it still matters, just not as much as before.
---
I don't know what you're trying to say here. You're saying slower weapons have a higher base damage, but you go on to admit because of normalisation the contribution they get from AP is lower, which means the damage is lowered.
---
So, before normalisation the Wirlwind Axe calculation would look like this assuming 1000AP.
---
*base weapon damage + weapon speed \* Attack Power / 14*
---
*154 + (3.6 \* 1000) / 14 =  268 damage.*
---
After normalisation it would look like this:
---
*base weapon damage + (X \* Attack Power / 14) \[X is 3.3 for two handed weapons\]*
---
*154 + (3.3 \* 1000) / 14 = 246 damage.*
---
Now the sword for before and after.
---
*Before: 124 + (2.9 \* 1000) / 14 = 216 damage.*
---
*After: 124 + (3.3 \* 1000)/14 = 244 damage.*
---
The axe is better by only **two** damage at the top end after normalisation for instant attacks.  
---
If my calculations are correct (happy to be corrected if they aren't) the sword should be an absolute no brainer for humans to get.
---
I got you. I was just clarifying that you are correct this was indeed a thing. Just not a 1.12 thing. Though I will glady trade WF proccing off of windfury for it lol.
---
Hah I moved away a while ago so we don't live near each other anymore. I'm buying him an account though with a month sub.
---
There's 50 posts in this thread and you haven't offered your opinion yet. Of course I'm biased. I think guild banks are a good idea. That's the premise of the discussion. Now you tell me why you think they're a bad idea.
---
I actually don't know how people played paladins back in the day, specifically ret paladins. I tried making one on pserver but holy shit you have 2 offensive spells until level 32 I think when you finally get exorcism and then that only works on certain types of enemies.
---
What?? Hunter T1 is freggin awsome. Its samurai mixed with some trapper skin theme!
---
i dont remember if this is a troll item or an actual bis.
---
So you missed the other 24 hours last time?
---
I was 24. Had already tried Star Wars: Galaxies and hated the grindiness of it. I was a huge Blizzard fan from way back and had been following the development of WoW for a while. Loved that it would have quests like a single player RPG and that you could solo level. When beta started I found a bootleg pirate server to mess around in. All you could do was explore, but it was freakin amazing. 
---
Never got into beta, but I was on the forums a lot. Played the WoW stress test and was blown away. Paladin with Crusader Strike was my favorite. Then when release day came, I was in the middle of a move and my business failing and a bunch of shit, so I completely forgot about it until May 2005 when I was in the store and saw the WoW box.
---
I got immediately excited, bought it, installed it and played until around level 25 on a Human Mage (Paladins were no fun without Crusader Strike, so I dropped him in Westfall) but then I started having problems. The game would crash after like 2 minutes, nothing I did would fix it. So I quit for about 6 months or so, but upgrading my computer fixed the issue. (I think it was a memory problem)
---
By then I had convinced my brother to play so we rolled a pair of Orcs. He was Warrior, I was Shaman. I didn't get to level 60 until after the AQ gates were open. Got pre-raid geared around when Naxx came out, but had scheduling issues that kept me from raiding, when that was worked out and I was ready to do my first MC, the guild I was in decided that with BC just around the corner, they were done raiding.
---
New content doesn't *need* to make a near-equal amount of old content obsolete. WoW is over 14 years old and how much non-trivial content does it actually have? You know what keeps players subscribed? Content. Meaningful content.
---
Yes i agree. In the past we just kicked these people. One of the coolest runs ever was a 4 man brd, after we kicked the tank. We killed emperor and everyone wanted to go to bed, but it was super fun!
---
Or “I’m no changes, but..”
---
I'm so happy that the person went ahead and reported it as a bug afterwards. Y'all need to report that stuff the second it happens.
---
It's no different from accepting 1.12 itemization and talents. All of it makes MC/BWL easier than it already was which is why I want compensation buffs.
---
&gt;In classic, everything from 1-60 has some kind of relevancy.
---
Its because lvling was more punishing, and actually gearing up lvling made it easier. So progressing your character before lvl 60 feels more rewarding and worthwile.
---
In TBC they nerfed a lot of the 1-60 lvling areas and increased XP, and in WotlK they did again, and rotated around the early game spells (warriors gained that spell after a killing blow, don't remember what its called) and they added heirlooms + LFG which made gearing up completely irrelevant, and just ccompletly underwhelming.
---
Vanilla unlike in every other version of WoW is actually fun, because its a long journey, gearing is fun and you actually have to put in some effort,so it feels more like a an actual game as oppose to a completly mindless grind (altough it is for the most part).
---
Obviously a lot of these aspects gets badly hurt in TBC, raped in Wrath and murdered in Cata. So enjoy it while you can.
---
Its slow but steady w/ a lot of water
---
Now that quickhealz is gone I can no longer touch myself while playing I actually have to do things.
---
Sigh.. Sitting to activate crit reactive procs is NOT the same as sitbatching to trigger procs. I dont know why this has to be explained 2000 times. They are entirely different things. What they changed was so getting crits from SITTING would not triggers the procs, but by standing up inside the batch window you will as far as the game is concerned be STANDING when the crit occurs.
---
I even linked the video which you clearly didnt look at.
---
Priest are one of the best levelers. They have very little downtime due to spirit tap.
---
[Welcome to the Deadmines (Rise to Power 2010 Winner)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX7ehxyYRQc)
---
Well i alllllllways play holy priest. Its getting tedious around 60 before that its kinda fine because you NEVER die and have to walk 10 mins.
---
But farming the items for that level 60 epic cloak takes for fucking ever.
---
Here for more babyrage over the existence of streamers
---
Gw2 was a great alternative up until war of thorns. Iuuno how it is now
---
Well in my opinion it did  take away from game everything. Base rush was just something completely different and what it is now in retail. For this reason i just prefer to have old AV, because why the hell not. Everyone involved still gain honor and its something you wont find anywhere else in game.
---
No one would disagree they fucked up the loot in D3, that said, Diablo as a franchise has always been about mass slaughtering enemies. I'm not downplaying the loot aspect, it's just not relevant to the discussion at all.
---
Leveling shadow was perfectly fine.  It was also a pretty solid lowbie pvp spec so you could easily defend yourself against equal level ganks.
---
Assuming he played 5 years straight (2004-2009) that's 1825 days of playing 6.57 hours a day.
---
200 IQ player right here.
---
How do you figure its " Not the same, at all" ? Yea I know there are some slight differences but it is actually, for the most part, the same damn thing.
---
*laughs in full time employment vacation days*
---
Yea I for one have no problem with boosters. Theres more then one way to get the oranges up the stairs. No problem with hard core farmers buying some epic runs. That being said. I really hope Blizzard has a way to keep China and, Asia in general off of American servers.
---
You should go for mace spec with this template !
---
What sucks is that the sub still stays the same so you can't vote with your wallet to improve current retail
---
Need more or I guess I’m right.
---
Look on your character sheet then?
---
boring but fairly fast.
---
EthicalPiranha has left the chat.
---
Because I think there comes a point where you just have to be happy Blizzard is doing Classic at all. They picked 1.12 ... and that's where the debuffs were at for 1.12. Just like everything else... talent points, abilities and balance, hunter pet stuff, etc.
---
It would probably be way too large an undertaking to also phase out Classic changes as they happened.
---
The decision was made. But hey! We can play Classic!
---
How did you find it?
---
What I’m finding irritating is the ridiculous amount of posts ‘not sure what to play between x and y’. There’s so much out there if you just google it - make your own damn mind up!
---
Does it take a significant amount more of time to raid as a prot warrior at 60 vs a hunter or mage?
---
I want to tank but I have a gf I don't want to neglect and a full time job. 
---
She told me, "I want you to play what you want don't worry about me.", But she doesn't know man...
---
My main goal is specifically exalted because the kris of unspoken names + jin'do's bag of whammies is better than BWL gear and is easier to get, though tons of not-quite-AQ40 gear is stupid good too
---
If you do that then you geared poorly. Trade some D for some offense. Then you do more threat. If you are defending against the boss so hard. You can't take any dmg to generate rage. You went too far into defense.
---
Leave it to reddit to be over dramatic and condescending when arguing with imaginary friends
---
Big
---
Real
---
Thank god I found my wife before Tinder became what it is.
---
Im torn between orc rogue or hunter. I like hunter, but im afraid that it will get boring if after Tier 1/2 upgrades doesnt matter that much due scaling. Also deadzone scares me, even thou i had 60lvl hunter in vanilla.
---
Also i like stealth and funny things you can do with it. Im a little scared that is doing BG:s with rogue get boring fast.
---
Can someone try to sell me these classes?=)
---
Without a reasonable doubt, yes.
---
It wouldn't have been the same thing at level cap.
---
It would just mean you would only want to wear your current expansion gear. For instance, you'd get some tier 21 or whatever they're on now, and it would just say "1% crit". But you look at a piece of gear from Classic and it would say "1% crit at level 60 (.03% crit at level 120)". They *already do this* with other systems, such as level based procs that scale down as you level up. 
---
But, whatever. It'd take more than that to fix retail's problems.
---
Hi, /u/DarkPhenomenon
---
Ahuhhuhhuhhhhh
---
Yeah. But thats kinda true for all the 3 latest expansions. If the increase from the previoes expansion was 2000%, then 1500-1800% of that increase happened *at* max level.
---
Hit level 120 in BfA and had 50k health. That doubled within a few days, just by doing world quests as well as normal and heroic dungeons.
---
Edit: this happens because for some reason, each new raid has to almost completely invalidate the previous raids gear. So the ilvl gap between each and every raid apparently has to be 15-20 ilvls.
---
This didn't happen back in vanilla, where the ilvl gap for lvl 60 items was 20... across the entire game! Early raid gear was ilvl 66, and Nax gear was ilvl 86.
---
Hi, /u/Sable17, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
It's really a matter of how well you play your class.
---
Some people play hybrid specs because they like the spec and are good enough at it that even though the spec cannot put up the DPS numbers, they manage to be competitive DPS wise, they don't die, they use their utility to debuff/buff, heal and/or tank and fill niche roles, like giving a group a bonus to crit or a nice aura.  And by competitive, I mean close to the optimal DPS for that class and spec.  I'm sure there is theory craft out there which says optimally, a class with "X" talents will do "Y" DPS, so you should be in the range of that, whatever the optimal theory craft says you should be doing.  A feral drood who manages to keep up good damage, gives a crit bonus to their group, and can react well, like switching out to bear form to off-tank when off tanking needs doing, would be a good example of the ideal hybrid class for raid.
---
But some people play hybrid specs because they like the spec and simply don't care what other people want them to do.  They have put little to no thought into the spec, merely picking abilities they like to use.  These are people who show up to raids specced for pvp, or missing vital talents.  These people may or may not play their spec well, but in my experience, they do not.  Their numbers tend to be bad, even for a hybrid spec, like a BM hunter getting less damage on target than the tank in a raid (Beast Master Hunter wasnt faceroll easy to do good DPS with in Vanilla), or a Ret Paladin getting worse numbers than the tank (really, anyone getting comparable or worse numbers compared to the tank, unless they are the offtank, is bad at WoW).  If you are this kind of hybrid, the kind who just wants to play your class like you want to play it, then do everyone a favor and don't raid.
---
Raids are about cooperation and teamwork, about a group of people doing something together.  So if you aren't willing to change your play-style into something that will improve your performance or meet the needs of the group, then you are just dragging everyone else down, and wasting the time of 39 other people.
---
Why did he need an invite to see the item?
---
UBRS keys are key.  You also need UBRS for BWL attunement, plus it has lots of good gear.
---
If its like vanilla you probably won't even get a raid spot as enhance. If you want to dps in raids I would certainly choose rogue.
---
It's this philosophy that should have been  - and should be, if somehow Classic is so successful that they want to add a set of servers with additional content - followed.
---
As another poster aptly put it, its like wearing a bridge.
---
the numbers will likely increase in europe. its 11pm now instead of 1 am + atleast in my country tomorrow is a national free day..
---
Ýou get crazy amounts of rep with CC too when you are clearing AQ, but yeah you can farm it in advance with summoning lords, there should be lots of people interested.
---
Sure it does. Everything will be in its 1.12 state when it releases. You want things in their state before 1.12.
---
Well... theres some sweet sets.  Most mage, Paladin, and rogue sets look really great even by todays standards.
---
The green one.
---
I agree to a degree, but vanilla could also feel like irrelevant content until you hit 60. I joined late in Vanilla and to my friends, it basically didn’t matter until I hit 60. So yah if you start at the beginning of any game WITH everyone else it’ll feel like a complete world. And that’s inherently impossible in the expansions.
---
It's BIS if all you care about is mount speed
---
Iirc if you were in raid and close enough to dying npc you would get dhk. If far enough, you wouldn't, but range was something like 100 yards or maybe more.
---
Not to mention this is the literal point of a beta.
---
Health regen rates are wrong, armor / resiststance on mobs are wrong, etc etc. There are many more smaller things that are wrong. Then you have the stupid fucking spam prevention of private servers where anyone below x level cant even use /s much less /w. This kills the entire early leveling. As I said, there are more things but its not even close the same experience
---
100 yards is 91.44 meters
---
While this definitely falls into the "no changes" guidelines, since it relies on vanilla's server batching system to work and would have been possible through 1.3 and beyond... I do wonder if they will consider this an exploit that existed in vanilla due to technical limitations, but can be patched now.
---
Clearly they didnt *intend* for players who are crit while sitting to get ability procs, so I'm guessing they'll count it as an exploit to be fixed. I wouldnt mind getting some levels in with it first though, lol.
---
I will get an auto accept/complete addon for my next attempts. My goal is to do 1-5 in 18 min, and the zone in like 25 min.
---
I am kind of neutral on guild banks, but I think we want Classic to be close to vanilla.   By WOTLK there are many improvements to the game, but we shouldn't add them all in.  I am happy with how Classic is now in the tests.
---
&gt; Why are you all ok with 16 debuff slot in phase1
---
"We" are not. "We" didnt ask for that.
---
I really fucking hate ratings. Especially with mastery where what the number actually means is completely different for every spec
---
It's on par with Naxx weapons, but also requires like 2000+ gold in mats to craft.
---
I'm not sure between warlock or rogue. I played vanilla as a warlock, it was pretty fun but also really fucking annoying. I did zg, Mc, and bwl. I had a rogue alt that I didn't touch until mop then I always loved him. Now I want to do it all over again as a rogue but it might be fun to do it as a lock again.
---
I'm excited for gear score to be non-existent
---
I always hear of this mythical sweet spot where druids do more threat than prot but take less damage than a DW fury tank. But I have never actually seen it. Feels like I take less damage as a DW fury and just destroy the druids in threat. Even when they crowd pummeler their threat feels really bad.
---
Yeah... sometimes it has spirit too.
---
Thanks. I haven’t reached level 30 yet. I’m currently at level 18, having just achieved honored with both Stormwind and Darnassus towards the beginning of Darkshore (as a human with the 10% rep bonus). So, exalted with any faction by level 40 looks unlikely. I was hoping we would get the higher rep values indicated in those other databases, along with spillover rep active in the starter zones, but no such luck.
---
I came back and played the last few months of Legion and thought that system was bugged because the numbers hockey sticked into the next galaxy over at some point
---
Blizzard explained this. You can search it out. Or just be pedantic.
---
Best card ever. I'm still rocking some 770 GTXs right now
---
You can poke holes in #nochanges all day but ultimately it's not about what's logical, rather limiting interpretation of the game so that it matches classic as closely as possible.
---
Can't counter-spell a gun
---
they literally just got away from rerunning old raids to get set bonuses that were helpful in the current raid tier.  turns out the player base loathed that in order to min max they had to raid NH and TOS to get titan forged gear for their mages in ABT. do not argue legion was not the most content at the highest frequency pace of any other active game for 16-18.
---
where's the lie?
---
Release TBC on all servers. Let the Vanilla wannabes re-roll on brand new servers. There's your prestige mode.
---
I had a few until recently because of RFA but since they were now considered starter accounts I was able to clear the clutter up using the web service.
---
Not necessarily. I'm in and I never got my email.
---
people are so used to Blizzard's betas being an advertisement and not an actual beta that they get confused when they actually encounter bugs
---
Wear shitty gear if you want more of a challenge.
---
Even worse, they changed Hitpoints to Constitution. Disgusting.
---
A quick google puts it as 2009, five years after release. Am I missing something? https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Race_Change_service
---
I think you are mis remembering otherwise m8.
---
You know as a healer, rogues are not a priority but if you insist on mortal-striking yourself, you're going to fall so far down the list that even hunter's pets will receive heals before you :D
---
Level 18?
---
You can also just open your wallet and buy 110 levels in bfa yeah?
---
your right it's more, dps. Been a while I got confused with item level since Crescent of Forlorn Spirits does have higher item level and could even be enchanted with burning crusade enchants since item level 35+.
---
I mean that's still a problem in vanilla. As more content phases are released you'll see stuff from the earlier phases become mostly pointless. Nobody is going to be farming hydraxian warlords rep when the naxx phase is released for example.
---
Blizzard should hire you
---
1) BFA players legit paid for classic.     
---
2) Shared sub is a good thing . Tons of players will play both, at no extra cost. Also, they know the extreme majority of people will quit classic very fast, at least they have a chance to keep them on retail, with a more casual friendly experience.
---
I agree, When it comes down to it. If this is a deal killer play something else.
---
When is the stress test?!?!?!?! Didn't know there was one today.
---
i think this is just a byproduct of them adding expansions, not anything that was particularly better about classic
---
Yea I’m in beta and I’m already done playing. If I keep it up when launch happens it won’t be nearly as exciting or fun. Going to save going all out and BIS when it matters
---
15 min? I think? I’m at work /:
---
It's not a bad idea, I just don't think I would reroll the same class so I wouldn't use the system
---
Except, warriors damage scales exponentially and is a huge component of threat. A fury can multiply his damage by 120% for 30 seconds. He can even pop reck and multiply that further. Enrage does tge same.  A few flat threat modifiers doesnt mean warriors don't scale as well as druids. I constantly out threat geared druids at all stages of game on p servers.
---
All threat is based on raw damage. Watriprs get 145% threat from dmg. And their dmg scales better than druids.
---
he says while starting an argument
---
Do rogue
---
&gt;I think 1.12 made the consumable change where certain types wouldn't stack,
---
Fairly certain that was changed early in BC.
---
In current WoW dozens of boosters spam sell dungeon runs repeatedly, it ends up massively cluttering the chat and stopping any other interactions in trade chat.
---
Better yet the original fe reaver: devilsaurs
---
Rogues run train in Wpvp. They are in no way over rated in that. Where they begin to fall short is BG pvp and large group pvp.
---
They would have to apply other weird buffs to mobs to avoid inflated stats. Remember the Sunwell debuff? It globally nerfed players dodge chances because they had scaled out of hand. So if you want to have flat % adders on gear, you'd have to nerf it against mobs with raid-wide stuff like this.
---
Now, I think that could be a good way to add post-Naxx level 60 content to keep gear in check. Could also add stat DR to PvP to keep the stat bloat curtailed.
---
you're making it worse there buddy... (link?)
---
Lol sounds like you got some inspiration from esfand

*Our name is* ***Legion*** *and we wish you to join us in our community where there’ll be long sweaty hours of WoW classic.* 
---
**Europe - Horde - PvP**
---
We are a large group of people who work full-time jobs, attend university, combine education and jobs or generally something else that consumes at least 40 hours/week. 
---
If you’re a new player, this will be the perfect place to settle down. Our core group is vastly experienced, when it comes to all aspects of WoW, and will have the ability to teach you what you want/need to enjoy WoW classic to the fullest level.
---
There will be no requirements, obligations or musts in this guild you don’t have to participate in events or play a certain amount of time. We are aiming to form and keep a core raid group which will have certain requirements when it comes to attendance, gear, and attitude. 
---
When it comes to loot during raids we will use a Loot Council that will be appointed at a later point. Raid schedule will be set up later by the guild, but will most likely be between 19:00 and 23:00 CEST on one, possibly two weekdays.
---
So if you’re looking for long sweaty hours of WoW classic in great company with a bunch of semi-casual tryhards, you’ve found them.

Oh no, missing a level 30 beta, the life is over
---
change is bad i want the game to be easy
---
he obviously didn't care about the encounter
---
Fun fact: Garrosh, at the end of MoP, had multiple health resets because otherwise he would have had much more health than WoW's 32-bit integer system could support. This was why they squished stats for the first time in WoD. They didn't complete the transition to using 64-bit until Legion.
---
As for gold, I think the inflation was pretty severe even beginning with BC. Counting BC, gold seemed to inflate by around 6x per expansion until Legion. (I think it's been fairly stable since then, actually.)
---
Dot, Shield, Wand. People in my guild in the Beta were just saying last night how easy it is to level priest and how OP wands are lol.
---
He wanted to get credit toward the mob for a quest or for the drop
---
People are crazy thinking classic will overtake retail. Retail gets new content. Until classic is promised new content, no way its numbers will surpass retail long term. 
---
Or maybe if Blizz botches up all content releases for a few more years.
---
Looks like sharding is working as intended. Prepare for August 27th, boys!
---
Well I look forward to being proven wrong, but I would still bet on it happening week 2. All the power to those who try and get it ASAP, I just think they're underestimating the enormity of the grind they are about to undertake.
---
One aspect I loved about the artifact and class hall quests is how many times they'd have you travel to old content locations.  There's a massive world of warcraft but you forget about it because the game focuses only on the current patch.
---
With the wrong talents? Yeah it can be brutal. With wand spec/spirit tap-&gt;shadowform? No, it's super easy, definitely top 3 easiest classes to level in the game.
---
You have zero downtime, if you wand for a while at the end of each kill. Spirit tap gets you so much mana back, you never have to sit and drink. I don't even buy water while leveling, unless I'm going to a dungeon and there isn't a mage in the group. 
---
They are almost unkillable in PvP, unless the opponent is significantly higher level, there are multiple people, or they get you when you pulled more than 1 mob. Psychic scream, PW:S, mana burn, and silence just wreck a lot of classes; and they are ludicrously tanky with devouring plague/vampiric embrace/shadowform/dispel magic/PW:S/Inner fire/Touch of undeath.
---
Their rotation is about as easy as it can get. PW:S, mind blast, SW:P, mind flay, wand wand wand till dead. Re-apply PW:S if necessary, use psychic scream when your shield drops if you pull more than 1. Cast silence/psychic scream if the mob's hands start glowing green or yellow. Boom, done.
---
The biggest downside to priest leveling (only downside?) is that they are very wand reliant. But, if you get gravestone sceptre, it's practically BiS till level 40~ish. From there, get the vendor wand, till you can get the wand off noxx in mara and/or the wand in ST.
---
Its a chore because the quests are so boring, nothing ever feels different. It feels like trying to play cookie clicker manually.
---
I can't look at it. My work does not let me. I thought you were talking about /sit proccing. Not an obvious exploit allowed by insufficient technology. Either way it has no place in Classic. That being said I am not saying you are wrong. I just didn't understand exactly what you were saying.
---
Water Totem quest isn’t THAT bad, it’s a lot of traveling but if you plan it well, you’ve got other stuff to do while you’re on the road. 
---
Fuck the Druid Aquatic Form quest, that was obscene.
---
Do you make one for durator ?
---
Priest leveling is easy as hell. Especially with the enhanced wands of 1.12
---
Yeess! This is the same for me too! Although I'm used to playing a tauren female because of retail and warstomp is clutch for PvP, plus +15 to herbalism is nice for leveling.
---
Can you do battlegrounds at level 10?
---
Aw man...MSN Messenger. RIP. Had so many custom emotes on that thing.
---
A ganking rogue will wait for you to be close to dead with a mob and then just ambush you
---
Except that since they share a subscription, if you play Classic you'll essentially still be supporting retail for the first year+.
---
Cannibalism is physically impossible until it's time to fork over $60 for the next expansion.
---
(Remembers this happening constantly in retail) maybe layering isnt such a good idea....
---
I want to say that they added something where the efc became visible after a certain amount of time, but maybe they added that in TBC. Or I could be completely wrong.
---
Ya, the curve in retail is crap. Its far too exponential at level cap
---
Subbing for classic is fine, but if you want to sub for a chance to get into the small beta test you're fucking retarded
---
That website has been completely fucked by spam uploads, at least on my screen.

IME the real question is not how to get people to farm, but how to get them to keep or donate what they've farmed rather than selling it for gold. Like, a mage just farmed 20 Living Essences and he can either donate them or he can sell them for enough gold for 2x repsecs to actually be able to PVP properly for a bit.
---
The best way to motivate is run loot council and make it known that farming for the guild is a factor in getting awarded gear upgrades. Then actually follow through and reward people who donate a ton with gear, and call them out as a big contributor when you send them whatever drop. People are less likely to raid log once they know that raid attendance alone will leave them behind the itemization curve.
---
There's not a need for much farming until the AQ War Effort starts. After that, you need people donating CC rep-builders (e.g. Encrypted Pages) so you can rapidly get select people Exalted CC for NR crafting. Then you need people to donate NR gear mats (e.g. Living Essences). People also need to farm NR gear drops from instances for their own use. If someone is going for the gong then he'll need help farming carapaces.
---
Otherwise, mats for tanking pots/food because the tanks have trouble farming for it themselves. Everyone else can handle their own farming for consumes.
---
Hey Kala. Been watching you stream and just want to say thank you for the great streams and content you’ve been putting out.
---
So you’re telling me if I have no clue what I’m doing I can message you for help... lol I’ll be almost new. Never had a membership when I was younger. Just did the trial 10x over but honestly don’t remember much of it
---
Is this on a pserver? I don't see any other players.
---
&gt;Personally I'm going paladin
---
Why would you do this to yourself... there are so many fun and interesting classes you could play, but instead, you choose the most boring and one-sided class in the game.
---
Have fun with your 2-button experience grind to 60 lol. And I hope you like being a buff-bitch in a robe standing in the back of the raid group haha
---
I guess I was. There were definitely paid services in Vanilla however.
---
If you have Gmail like I do, I found my stress test invite email in the promotion section. Never came to my main inbox.
---
Ever since searching for the "wow-killer" after Wrath ended, I always knew that the only game that could kill wow was itself.
---
This started to come to light with BfA with how the game was just starting to see the end of its lifespan from running out of ideas. But the real cherry on top is that classic is going to kill retail and breathe new life into the game at the same time.
---
You want fast attack speed for annoying push backs.
---
Broken Tooth from Badlands is the fastest one you can get.

Its a tough call, but if the only downside to warrior for you is a lack of friends (and warriors do need friends) I wouldn't worry about it. This game is gonna pretty much force you to find friends. If everything we have been dreaming about comes true with classic, this will be a much more social game compared to retail. And warriors are literal GODS in pvp if they have a healer buddy with them. If you are that worried about it, hit me up. I plan on rolling priest.
---
I mean... that's the game, though. That's sort of like saying if you don't like PvP you shouldn't play LoL. Uh, yep, you probably shouldn't.

Orc 2h axe Warrior with /sit to get 20% mele boost from enrage

Does enrage stack with blood fury?

Same build but instead of enrage, we have revenge chance to stun. And with orc passive a total of 40% stun resistance and full 2h axe specialist

Dumb. Classic is ass. It’s like cod4 ... we all wasted so much time on it in the past why do it again. If I play classic I’ll be pissing in soda bottles again when I was 12
---
&gt;to decrease visibility
---
heh
---
Pet at lvl 10, am I correct?
---
That is how macros work in retail, the part you’re probably misinterpreting is “button press”. For example, you can make trinkets a button press, but Items are not classified as “abilities” so despite them being active, they do not *require* a button press. However, Judgement and Seal, for example, do require button presses, so even though there’s not a GCD trigger, you must press the macro twice, i.e. you can’t cast two offensive effects in a single button press. 
---
Usually, buffs/auras/trinkets/items don’t require button presses, but offensive abilities do. But then again, retail is a very different set of rules, despite having the same API.
---
In WotLK I got "very serious" about raiding and was in a top Horde guild. We were competing for world firsts in Hard Mode Ulduar at the time. I was crushing meters as a deep Affliction and later Destro lock and got a whisper from my GM telling me to put my BiS list together because I'd have first priority on all caster loot. I was fucking stoked.
---
Then I hit the excel sheet and realized I'd gain about 3-9% more *theoretical* damage by going from my current setup to the absolute best possible gear, with a new raid on the horizon.
---
And the NBA Finals were on and I wanted to watch that instead of raid. So I quit. That day. Walked away from a 5+ year journey because I looked down and noticed the treadmill.
---
I'm so excited to get under 100 ping with a non-private server.
---
The FD is mostly to drop a 2nd trap.  If you aren't 30 yet and pull in a clear-ish area, you can just trap 1, fear 1, kill steel.

Oh man thats amazing! Must have been misinfo when I heard it last
---
Your brain can't move a decimal point?
---
retail bad :rage:
---
Best solution I have heard, tbh. It’s like D2, a game whose difficulty and design was a direct influence on Classic. After you beat normal, it’s onto Nightmare and Hell modes. Classic can, and should do the same thing. A few caveats though. Once you tier up, there should be no going back, at least on a per instance basis. You do an attunement quest for Nightmare Molten Core, and that’s it. No more Normal. This actually solves a problem is raid guilds never wanting to retire content.
---
Of everything posted, I think this is the most realistic.
---
The nostalgia is overwhelming! Ty for post!

I got 8 in a row once, but I wasn't recording :( swear to Elune

WoW is going to be the thing that kills itself and it's going to be the truth unless they knock it out of the park with returning features for the next x-pack.

I believe bolvar has been the lich King in game as long as arthas and for longer in real time.

I guess this subreddit doesn't support shaking text =(
---
Not sure if it's technically a strawman, definitely a slippery slope fallacy though. 
---
I'm opposed to LFR/dungeon finder/sharding/phasing/flying mounts/etc like 90%+ of the classic community... but I think the #**NOCHANGES** crowd has ultimately been damaging to the community.
---
What's rough is, they'll be drowned out eventually, but I fear that it'll be the retail crowd that takes over.
---
how the fuck is this low effort
---
&gt; I'll never understand why Blizzard gutted class buffs.
---
Dumbest thing ever. Just another nail in the coffin for killing player interaction. Drive by buffs did a lot ot make everyone seem friendly.
---
Huh. Why do you think stats would inflate any differently under my suggestion? You'd still have approximately the same crit and dodge chance, etc.
---
A huge portion of this list is wrong. There's at least like 3 items for Hunters on Horde side that are rewards from quests, but the quests require level 12, 13, 17 etc. to do the quest.
---
Dad (40) had fucked up teeth for a while, he has money now, is now getting them fixed. It’s 2019 we can do quite a bit now (tbh is pretty quick, painless, and easy depending on what you need done). The answer for Asmon, as much as I like him, is laziness.
---
I enjoyed GW2 up until they added Fractals and Ascended gear. Back when it was just the open world, dungeons, and PvP. It just never came close to being as good as Guild Wars 1 was.
---
Yep! WSG.
---
e: As far as if we can do it during this 26-hour stress test period, no idea.
---
&gt; asmon is lvl 25 in his sfk , the game is a joke on private servers mostly. Private servers are overtuned to compensate for players having 15 years of experience and knowledge.
---
I'm confused. I just ran SFK on a popular private server with people around this level range and it was a cakewalk. So was every other previous dungeon. The risk of wiping is honestly very low for the entirety of the run.
---
I love how blizzard is just calling sharding "layering" now and everyone acts like it's fine. Literally the same issues are happening.
---
I've done enough brain damage in the last 15 years that it will be at least kinda new to me lol
---
Is this a shitpost subreddit now?
---
I respect that, but as a minmaxer myself I will try to explain how I have fun:  
---
For me, it's not about server first, elite pvp ranks or doing everything as fast as possible.  I durdle a lot and waste tons of time doing nothing.   But WHEN I actually do something productive in game, like leveling, or farming mats, I want it to be as efficient as (within reasonable limits) possible.  Because for me the enjoyment is not in killing those 30-50 mobs, but in all those other things.  So if I can kill 50 in a given hour with build A, and only 30 with build B, I will chose A.  
---
And A might be the obvious mainstream choice, but  that doesn't matter to me.  the game is big enough for me that I never run out of new things to do, other classes, other talent trees.
---
I do have gmail, but I just never got it at all, in any inbox.
---
that's rank 9
---
Yeah I miss the old stats rather then everyone just stacking haste or versatility or what ever new stat blizz replaces/changes.
---
It was much simpler to understand for a new player. Strength, Agility, Intellect, and stamina. They all speak for them selves and are staples in the RPG genre.
---
Hunter is gonna be so broken in the lvl 10 meta. A pet at low lvl is basically stronger than a character lmao.
---
I stopped playing around Wrath because "all of this will be worthless in 2 months why keep playing"
---
&gt; So yah if you start at the beginning of any game WITH everyone else  it’ll feel like a complete world. And that’s inherently impossible in  the expansions.   
---
This is not nescessarily true though. If you have your main, which saw all the content with all your fellow friends and faction members, and then proceed into the new expansion together, it very much feels like the beginning of something new, that's why I, and many others love to play on release week.  
---
At least that's my view on it.  
---
Leveling afterwards, is ofc a different thing.
---
I need to finish my 1-20 guide for alliance.
---
But I gotta kill 3 months, so I might do some horde stuff too :)
---
LOL. Seriously wtf.
---
I don't recall saying that
---
OMG, WHY CAN I NOT LOG IN? Can it be because I don't have a Beta invite?
---
d3 has become meme'd into a speed runner contest.
---
Yup.  I could maybe see a hunter out kiting the fear and just letting their pet do most of the damage.
---

T1 giantstalker shoulders on My orc Hunter&lt;3 I had Them for so Long haha
---
You do know vanilla quests are the same right? Go here, kill 12 of those, hand in. Repeat. 
---
It’s just a challenge and that’s what makes the game fun.
---
Nah that early stuff is removed.
---
This is such a silly rabbit hole to go down. 
---
Should they also progress through the patches as well rather than 1.12?  
---
Should they allow things like reckoning bomb paladins until someone uses it to kill Kazzak?    
---
Should they faithfully reproduce every bug and exploit?  
---
At the end of the day they are using the balance and mechanics of 1.12.  Using 8 debuffs arbitrarily with the talent tree and class balance of 1.12 would be even *further* from "nochanges" than simply using the mechanics as they existed in 1.12.  
---
Also it would be fucking terrible for game balance to use 1.12 trees but only 8 debuff slots.
---
Just adding some proof to this claim. In [this video from 2005 at 0:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgJDO6ZaMmQ) we can clearly see that the dwarf player, standing at the ally resto hut, can easily see horde players almost at horde tunnel.
---
Every item in endgame is a level 60 item. Do you mean leveling items?
---
&gt;Every “expansion” must be its own, integral, separate game, with its own complete, cohesive, holistic, 1-60 experience.
---
That's pretty much the current system though, right? Nothing in Legion matters. It has all been replaced in BfA. There's no one hanging out in New Dalaran. Artifacts have been drained of all their effects. The legendary items have no effect past 105. You buy BfA, you get a boost to 110 and start right at the newest expansion. The 1-110 content is vestigial.
---
Classic WoW has afforded the opportunity for players to have it either way. Retail can be the latest patch experience and Classic can be the persistent world and leveling experience. Instead of worrying about how to fix Retail's issue of how to course correct it's atrophied leveling journey, just cut it out via character boosts. Retail should have all newly created characters boost to the latest expansion.  It's despicable they sell boosts so you can skip their atrophied content.

Or googling for basic competency

How people don't see this I don't understand. If our team loses because you suck or were too lazy to learn how to play this simple game anyone with average motor skills could. You're a dick

You don't need to be Lebron James to play this game very close to perfectly in a lot of scenarios

In which world is the advanced mailbox, a feature that addons can basically replicate (you'd send multiple letters, but the cost is the same anyway) comparable to a full fletched "ingame" feature like guild banks?
---
Layering is also something people are heavily against, but they accept it because the other choice is a huge amount of servers and merges.
---
This has happened a couple of times to me before, I sometimes post very short and to the point posts. I think the automated removal system is purely based on number of characters in a post so it'll probably flag anything under like 50 characters or something. I mailed the mods and they approved it immediately (I'm surprised they didn't remove the automod response from it though)
---
Ah, didn't realize Petopia had a classic section up. Thanks for linking, I'll use it as a reference going forward.
---
Dude this is 100% how I feel
---
This is a pretty serious question for game mechanics that if not handled correctly could potentially lead to serious group aoe grinding exploiting to level insanely fast.
---
Alright, I thought so but wanted to make sure.  There seem to be certain things they kept and certain things they didn't.
---
I kinda see it as the two types of atheists. One type downright shits on religious people, and the other type just doesn't believe. Just as with the #nochanges crowd, one type actively sets out to shit on peoples suggestions, and the other type (the majority, I believe) just wants the game as it was: without any changes to the extent possible.
---
I wasn't here on first stress test. do i wait at the offline screen or close and reopen?
---
2:01 Server off line.   
---
Literally unplayable!
---
If you're on the realm selection screen can you just wait? Or do you need to refresh it by relogging?
---
Wasn't this added after 1.12?  
---
E: nvm was in 1.11 (if wowhead is correct), had to do some digging.   
---
E2: so retail wowhead says 1.11, classic.wowhead says 1.13 but I'm almost positive there wasn't a 1.13

Ugh I know, wall jumping was my favorite pastime, and it was never with the intent to cheat mechanics - just a platforming puzzle I set myself and to explore the mountains and find the occasional Easter egg.

---
This is sort of an issue with all MMORPGs that live for a couple of years, expansion keep adding more and more layers into the game making it feel bloated and filled with unnecessary elements as times goes on, for people who stick around all the time it doesn't initially seem bad but when you stop and decide to return to an MMORPG a few expansions later you start noticing the issue. It's why i can't see myself really returning to retail WoW fully ever or even other MMORPGs i played and stopped such as Guild Wars 2 and recently a year or so ago i stopped ESO.
---
so like, do we see in advance if we were invited to the stress test? refreshed my Bnet app just now and nothing new. if you got in, how much advance notice did you get?
---
wait
---
Preists are actually really good at grinding with a strong wand, especially shadow preists with a shadow damage based wand that gets a damage bonus from wand spec, and then that gets "double dipped" from shadow vuln on targets.
---
You win! For now...
---
"Crit Rating +x" is exactly as repetitive so yeah I see no problem with that.
---
UNINSTALL THE GAME xD
---
There's a skill called something like Beast Training where you can train your pets abilities. Some skills like growl, armor, stamina, and various resistances are learned from the pet trainer near hunter trainers.  Abilities like claw and bite are more complicated. Basically you have to find a pet that knows the ability and rank desired and tame it. Then use that ability until you learn it. Then you can teach it to the desired pet.
---
It goes against their current position that values are correct, which they are. If they just changed them now that all the evidence is out in the open, I *think* someone might notice.
---
As someone who is very excited for Classic yet started playing WoW in Legion. I tend to find people very nice and understanding to new players. I say all the time that I'm new and don't know what i am doing. The amount of help and advice I have recieved may just suprise you. People are nicer then what the gaming community makes it out to be.
---
Hahahaha I get the reference. God that brings back memories
---
No worries, it still won't work.
---
If you were in the last stress test, you’re in this one. No new invites this time. The next two should get invites ahead of the stress test dates though
---
For a game that already has like 4 years of content planned, 3 months seems negligible.
---
You can wait
---
What about the hate against the streamers?
---
It's 5:02AM in Western Australia; furthermore, I cannot login and I am questioning all my life choices.
---
Yes I am fine with it, because every boss in MC prior to majordomo was trivial to begin with.
---
Thanks for hangin man. Been a really great time
---
The stress test haven't even started but the servers are already down ^(/s)
---
It is unlikely but possible. BGs have been off for most of beta.
---
PvP as a rogue will never get boring, they are born to murder.
---
Rogues are hella fun but are competitive for a raid spot since they don't bring much to raids other than damage. Never played vanilla but I mained a rogue in retail and I can tell you it is the most fun thing to manipulate your opponents in bgs.
---
You’re the kid that makes everyone get in vent for a deadmines run, aren’t you?

I'm also wondering the same.
---
Reminds me of this:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XslcgQJMZaY
---
Monty Python and the Holy Grail scene. . .
---
Does it work with spellcasts?
---
I've been using "attack bar timer" forever, and one thing it DOESN'T do, is show a swing timer when you cast a spell. When you finish a spellcast, your swing timer is pushed back to its max duration, but the swing timer does not show this.
---
Should be pretty easy to implement, just have the bar act like you just swung, when you finish a spellcast.
---
Party xp rate in classic : 50/50 or 50%
---
On private servers it was 60% xp you gained as 2 man.
---
i havent played since cata i remeber reading somewhere that blizz deletes accts that werent logged in for 7 years was your acct &gt;7years since last login?
---
A priest is very good. A paladin is the best support in the game and, it's not really all that close. Freedom, Protection, Bubble, Cleanse, Sac, Plate and shield. Their kit is super unfair. It's not really even a debate among people who grind HW. Paladin is the definitive classic support class. All of that being said. Priests are still amazing and, the second best. With druids and shamans coming in a distant 3rd and fourth. Not having accesses to a defensive dispel magic is devastating for them.
---
Don't get me wrong. Would much rather play a shaman over a pally but, a team really doesn't need their support to play at being a mage. Still way more fun though. Also druids have their place as the indispensable FC so just play what you want.
---
Were there additional invites sent out for the stress test?
---
I'm in EU. I didn't get into the last stress test or the normal beta.
---
Because the person who said that would likely be a hunter themselves so there would be less competition for hunter loot. ;)
---
Servers offline still at 4:05.
---
I think this is one of the best arguments against proceeding to TBC if/once Classic becomes a huge success! 
---
(Give us 60 Kara, Hyjal, etc.! Make them slightly worse item level than Naxx or maybe have them fill niche specs or smth)
---
I always found it odd how killing the elites to get the mallet in the first place was harder than the whole instance.  IIRC, the elites in the Hinterlands were like 46-51 elite, while ZF was like 44-48 elite.
---
Yeah, I understood the generic skills across pet classes/species, but a lot of the named tameables used to have special abilities that weren't listed.  Lupos was a really popular one because of the armor debuff ability he had, but other ones like The Rake I'd mentioned, didn't seem to have their special ability anymore, so I was confused.
---
This is also coupled with the fact it's been almost 15 years since I played Vanilla, and never mained a hunter back then.
---
I can't login to server and it was supposed to be up 5 minutes ago wtf blizzard i want my mony back
---
I guess the guy who is supposed to turn the server on went to the bathroom at 1:59.
---
&gt; So my goal is to get exalted with org, on my ud rogue, asap. hopefully by 40. 
---
Won't happen. If you start Troll and level through all the areas that give Org rep, you will not hit exalted at 60 with Org. Maybe farm a repeatable quest? But the rep goes down if you outlevel the quest.
---
There is no problem to begin with
---

I wish I could filter out all of the:

For anyone using Carl-bot and wants to consolidate bot usage, I have a way of doing the same thing within Carl.

Simply create a Tag and give it whatever command you want (!wowclassic, !release, etc)
---
This is what your Tag should look like:
---
`WoW Classic Official Release in {td({strf:%Y-%m-%d %H.%M.%S}):2019-08-26 22.00.00}`
---
Warriors take forever to kill stuff at the beginning.  Two mobs at once can mean death unless you use everything you got.
---
Eh, 1.13 isn't necessarily "classic but higher stats", you could really do a lot that's still in the spirit of the game without just making end game content. In fact, I think to keep it true to classic, maybe less than half of it should be end game content.
---
CoT doesn't need to be 60 dungeons only, why not have a new wing of 40-60 dungeons? Kara, yeah, that's 60; but it doesn't need to be T4. IMO it should be a 10 man like LBRS with blues and the *occasional* epic drop, with new tier sets and class specific items to give reasonable buffs to specs that need it. E.g. some kind of buff for boomkin, or ret paladin gear. Some unique trinkets, tomes, or relics that give BiS unique buffs to those classes could go a long way.
---
Also, look at events like the scourge invasion, AQ opening, and the darkmoon fairie... Why couldn't more events like these be taking place, which are doable by players of all levels? That's just interesting content that doesn't break any of what made classic great, but just adds to it.
---
NO CHANGES.
---
I was waiting and its up now. No need to refresh
---
&gt; Were there additional invites sent out for the stress test?
---
Feel free to take a look at our Classic guild website and use any of our ideas. Best of luck to you!
---
https://sites.google.com/view/sanguine/about-the-guild
---
Well also remember that BiS for a lot of classes isn't tier. Hunters are one of the few classes that actually wear their tier gear for BiS. Not sure if that matters to you but, if you want to be aesthetic, effective, and wear your tier, you should probably roll a rogue.
---
Link?
---
The call is coming from inside the house!
---
Priests and Warlocks would probably still win. Rogues suck vs locks.
---
BOOM Tetris for Jeff

Yeah, but stuck at "Logging in to game server"

HQG is obnxoious. It's not really "high quality gifs" so much as "pasting epic funni mem text onto gifs".
---
Got to the character creation screen, which is about 3 steps further than last time.
---
Do we thank Gaben around here or is it someone else?
---
Showing up for me now, trying to enter the server
---
we do not know all the details just yet.  perhaps as in your example, and the one Ion gave back at blizzcon, the zones that have RTV and black lotus will not be layered in any number of instances.  That when you walk into winterspring or Burning Steppes you will be moved from layers 2 or greater and put into layer 1 for those economy impacting zones.  
---
Or it could be that the higher number of raiders and players on the servers need to have a higher number of black lotus spawns in order to fuel end game pve.  If there are 1 million players on a server they need 100 instances of black lotus spawns or tanks that are expected to have a flask for the boss will not have one due to over population.

---
At least the streamer had the decency to apologize, and it's not like he purposely did that. This is all on Blizzard.
---
I'm glad people keep bringing this up. It's getting kind of scary how so many people are apparently ok with this happening over and over again. Blizzard isn't going to do a damn thing unless people make a stink about it. This isn't layering as it was explained to us...it's a *bug* that needs to be stamped out by any means necessary and should be high on their priority list.
---
I have a severe alt problem lol
---
They're up... but not working.
---
Same!
---
Omar
---
Annnnd the game is frozen at the character list
---
Anyone get past Logging in message?    
---
^_   
---
Server is now online.    
---
BUT I get stuck at "logging in..."   
---
Music is awesome though.
---
The bat/owl are solid because they attack fast (especially the ZG bats) and have an aoe silence.
---
Raptors can be solid (even if they can't stealth like the in TBC WC raptors) but can provide really good attack dps with both claw and bite.
---
Cats/broken tooth with fast attack speed or stealth have good synergy with Night Elves.
---
Wolves with the attack boost buff howl are solid for groups, along with  decent dps.
---
And most popularly are the wind serpents with swoop (inc mv sp) and lightning breath. A 29 and 39 twink most preferred.
---
Hunter and warlock at 10 for sure.
---
stop crying
---
Short answer: yes
---
I'm in the character creation screen but nothing happens when I click accept to create the character.
---
Edit: it went further now, loading character list
---
&gt; You can clear MC with half of your raid lvl 58 in leveling greens.
---
&gt; Best PVP gear is gained by spamming BG.
---
&gt; There is no hard content, no challenge
---
World/server first MC is a challenge. Clearing MC with as few players as possible is a challenge (that allows for more loot per player). WR fastest MC run is a challenge. And that's literally "baby's first raid", designed for people who had never raided before... saying it's too easy is like saying LFR is too easy.
---
In PvP, you need to organize and win BGs if you want that top rank. And by doing so, you can actually develop a reputation on your server as being a badass soldier for your faction.
---
The biggest thing though, is that Classic is an RPG and not an instant satisfaction action game. So if you cant find a way to enjoy the journey, it's just not going to be for you.
---
"Logging in to game server" for about 3 minutes now, fingers crossed.
---
You mean it would've kept old content from being obsolete.
---
Servers are up, but trouble getting into game server again
---
I loved my alts in vanilla, they really meant something and all had a purpose (crafting mainly)
---
reap servers
---
**1.0 attack speed on broken tooth, 1.2 is base cat attack speed above a certain level (with some exceptions, like the rake, who is level 12 with 1.2 attack speed).
---
Yes, attack speed was normalized in TBC, so pets still have unique attack speed. But certain things like lupos will not do shadow damage, attack speed and skins are the only things that vary from pet to pet within a species.
---
It’s definitely Joe, but...
---
I've pondered this as well. My assumption is they put it in to give players a reason to revisit the dungeon again at the higher level as a way of stretching content further.
---
These times won't be correct when you're competing with hordes of players at launch though?
---
Wait what's that about? Is it just a joke?
---
It is definitely a different system, but it's become increasingly obvious that whatever code they're using for layering shares at least some of its DNA with sharding. These awful bugs are evidence enough of that.
---
I mean they are fine. People exaggerate, not sure if it's because they plan on playing rogue and don't want more rogues, but yeah. Rogues aren't ideal for group PvP, but a good rogue can be huge in killing a flag carrier on WSG. A huge 1.5k-2k coordinated ambush is like an instant kill if u have it with other classes instants. 
---
Sure, caught out of stealth they suck, but they suck EVERYWHERE out of stealth. This isn't retail, rogues absolutely suck out of stealth. That's why they are so good at locking people down, because by the time you get out with 30% HP, it's basically an even fight if they don't blind you or vanish and repeat.
---
yup
---
I think certain abilities take weapon dmg into account.
---
Yeah, and he still recommends using /sit macros.  I decided to keep his guides because most of the info he has is still pretty good, plus his caster guides are some of the highest quality out there.
---
&gt; Then the caverns of time can hold "heroic" versions of older instances, with a ragnaros that was not awakened too soon with some smal changes
---
i was thinking of something exactly like this, but with dungeons , like "oh we have found some fluctuations in the timeline we need you to go into the Deadmines/Wailing Caverns/Scarlet Monastery/X dungeon to find out whats wrong" and you go through the dungeons and fight the altered bosses and at the end theres the manipulator as an extra boss.
---
maybe style it a bit after Mythic+ where only at the end you get your rewards (cant take loot out of the timeline but you get "Displaced timeline copies" of the gear) but theres no warforge/titanforge or box at the end of the week
---
Priests are better single target healers than pallys. Pallys have greater versatility.
---
Propane
---
Thats what i mean, you can just reshuffle the same stat block in retail now, while each monster was actually different in vanilla.
---
Im hoping the fk they scrap this idea.
---
You are right that gold inflation started before MoP, but MoP had a huge amount of inflation, which is why the implemented so many different gold sinks; like transmog mammoths and the black market AH.
---
Then inflation spiraled out of control in WoD due to garrisons making gold farming so easy; I remember there were a bunch of guides on how to make 500kg+/week and tons of people were gold capped (before they released token and raised gold cap).
---
Then they released the token, and eventually (once WoD was finished), the inflation rate stabilized.
---
I'm in, but I can't use the chat channels, and I see absolutely no one else...
---
&gt; Every item in endgame is a level 60 item
---
In that context I mean raid pre-BiS. Dire Maul/Strath/AV stuff.
---
Predicting most of us will not be able to get on next 2.5 hours.   
---
And all streamers and people with beta invites will get on - like last time.
---
So the same thing I've seen even on Retail WoW, even when doing heroics.
---
Alliance endgame in a nutshell
---
Im on character creation but nothing happens when you confirm. Gotta wait and keep destroying the button.
---
Hi, /u/spicesniffer
---
should i restart or keep waiting at the "logging in to game server"
---
To play devils advocate, in retail, each zone has a campaign. A roughly linear story that lines up with the big bad in the zone. Scaling is really good for this since every zone is episodic now. Don’t want to stop midway through the big show. 
---
Silverpine forest is somewhere I think this REALLY shines. You’re a new solider in the Horde, and you’re sent to the front lines in the war against Gilneas. The questline is epic, and I feel like I’m actually a solider being given orders, and unlike my main, I don’t feel like a god because in a number of quests you actually get rescued or run away because you ended up in an oh shit moment. The gameplay is super smooth and feels more like a really casual RPG. 
---
Some zones are better than others and what not, but if you’re just interested in small local side stories in WoW with some comedy, modern leveling is in a pretty good spot. 
---
That said, it’s super easy, you couldn’t die if you tried and since everything is your level, there’s no missing or glancing blows on “boss” type mobs. If you’re looking for a combat challenge, it’s not that.
---
WAR was great. It was really the first mmo to allow players to participate in significant, meaningful world pvp after relatively little time invested compared to other mmos. And then the pvp itself was better than anything else at the time imo
---
Spamming the accept button!
---
Did you eventually get in? I’m in the same boat here
---
I dont get it
---
Because farming a stronger version of an item you already have is *definitely* meaningful content.
---
I never said I was hoping it would drop???
---
I want it to suceed so I can get later expansions
---
Any tips on getting a quick wand? I was practicing leveling and realized I haven't found a wand and was getting to level 13+ and it was really holding me back.
---
Good to see Blizzard is sticking with no changes. This is the same as the last stress test, can't login. Good on them for doubling down omegakek
---
Why are they used to that? All of their betas have plenty of bugs.
---
Yup. This happens in retail all the goddamned time. I plan on being an annoyingly helpful presence in Classic, but even I'll think twice about mid-fight invitations if bullshit like this keeps happening.
---
And that's only *one* consequence of bugged layering.
---
All pets can learn Cower. This reduces threat.
---
All pets can learn Growl. This is a taunt.
---
Most pet types can learn Bite, the ones that can't can usually learn Claw. These are just straight damage.
---
Boars can learn Charge. 8-25 yd range, 1 second immobilize, bonus damage on next attack.
---
A handful of pet types can learn Dash and a handful more can learn Dive. These both increase movement speed by 40/60/80% for 15 seconds.
---
Wolves can learn Furious Howl, giving extra damage to all party members next physical attack.
---
Windserpents can learn Lightning Breath, which is straight nature damage.
---
Cats can learn Prowl. This is stealth, movement speed is decreased but the next attack is increased.
---
Scorpids can learn Scorpid Poison. This is nature damage over 10 seconds that can stack up to 5 times.
---
Birds and Bats can learn Screech. Does a bit of AoE damage and reduces the melee attack power of all enemies in melee range.
---
Turtles can learn Shell Shield, reducing all damage received by 50%, but also reducing damage done by 43%. Lasts 12 seconds.
---
Gorillas can learn Thunderstomp. This is AoE Nature damage.
---
The passive skills that all pets can learn from the pet trainer are: Increased Stamina, Increased Armor, and one skill for Increased Magic Resistance to the 6 magic types (Holy doesn't have resistance in Vanilla).
---
To be able to teach the bet a new rank of the skill, they have to be appropriate level and you have to have tamed a pet that new that skill.
---
You can only have 4 skills active on a pet at one time.
---
Thats not a prediction thats the intent. Were stress testing the login and stuff like last time. In 2 hours blizz will turn off their analyze tools reboot the server and let us play 24 hours.
---
Kewp waiting, it eventually put me into char creation
---
Chuck Norris stress tested the game server, now the server is too stressed and has gone for a cup of tea and a nice lie down.
---
While I don't see a huge advantage to it, I have no reason to oppose it. Why not, it's just an honor thing. Heck id be OK with an entire cosmetic set ala heritage armor
---
You could make the exact same argument against gems because of enchanting existing.
---
Do we know if its better you log and try to get back in or sit and logging in to server screen?
---
&gt; what do you people know
---
I mean Ion mains Shaman so...
---
I didn't think it was dumb, I just thought nostalgia clouds memories, I remember how slow and grindy it was, and how guild drama can ruin everything.
---
But watching streams hit my nostalgia hard, so I'll most likely play to relive that 1-60 experience.
---
Goes both ways don’t get mad if your a meme spec and can’t get groups.
---
Hi, /u/Rhynchelma
---
Because power creep and making old content obsolete instead of expansion expanding the game. Crazy.
---
&gt; IIRC, the elites in the Hinterlands were like 46-51 elite, while ZF was like 44-48 elite.
---
Yeah but think of how having the Mallet would get you insta invites.
---
Weapon damage is clearly labelled in the formula I cited.
---
Interesting message when you mouse over Enter World. 
---
&gt; The world is scheduled to be available soon.
---
They are world pvp gods though with stealth and abilities with longer cooldowns. You can decide when to engage or retreat which is something rogues often take for granted.
---
&gt; 2% increase
---
This is all gear though now. Its geared to your spec and that's it. Theres no "this piece of gear does X and allows me to spec Y and Z to really utilize it". No picking what stats to use
---
But at the same time it makes less sense for your character to become less powerful because you leveled up.
---
&gt;Blizzard should listen to players since they clearly don't play their own game
---
Might be abit boring, if you find yourself in a situation where grinding is your only option for a while, team up with a frost mage for that sweet AOE and just shatter everything. Super fun!
---
Yup. Sitting at "Logging into the sever"  
---
Not sure if I should just let it go or if I should try to relog in
---
I’m currently a complete noob to wow, and even I am hyped just by how people have been excited. Is this what you call a bandwagon?
---
I had a guild all through vanilla ( still do technically but its empty now) I'm not sure I'd have the time to dedicate to it anymore.  
---
I became a guild leader by accident really as a small group of friends moved over from counter strike to play and I'd had EU beta experience.  
---
When I think back a lot of my fondest memories are related to the guild and how it grew in to a good raiding guild full of great people.  But it will never be the same and I also remember more than our fair share of drama which took up a lot of time.
---
Still same screen
---
Let me just..
---
Grab my dick and double click for porn...
---
Porn..
---
PORN.
---
Awesome, thanks
---
Yeah I have been downing the member berries like crazy
---
The struggle is real. 15 mins at the logging in screen
---
I'm exactly the same.
---
Brings back memories...
---
I was in on the server first Onyxia kill on Deathwing US.  I remember the devs were watching us and congratulated us after the kill.  It was a complete shit show, but we somehow managed to get it done.  At that time there were no online guides that we were aware of and we had to come up with a plan on our own.  I played the game for another 8 or 9 years on and off, but that was probably my favorite PVE moment.   Thanks for sharing OP.
---
If you are looking to level in classic, you want to enter duskwood at 23+ at minimum. Other than that, I totally agree with you. As a small kid, I used to play Sacred 1, however I have never progressed to harder level of difficulty in that game, because on higher difficulties, mobs would raise their level according to my level in all the zones. The reward from progress was lost and I knew from day 1, that making scaling levels in WoW was a terrible idea, thanks to this experience.
---
They could avoid this by having the items lose effectiveness above a certain level, like they’ve done for other items since.
---
For dorf I go male. For orc female, animations aren’t as bad as male and no horde hunch. Probably the thing I dislike the most about horde is the hunch that all the males have. Kills the aesthetics for me. Still a horde at heart though.
---
That just sounds like a giant artificial hamster wheel to be honest. Your basically farming outlands just to get better at farming outlands. 
---
What's so great about vanilla imo is the pvp and pve overlap between gear. PVPers are forced to raid to get better gear to pvp and likewise for pve players. 
---
Everyone always says the expansion / raising leveling cap format is flawed by honestly it's players expecting a single game to last forever and ever that is the flaw here.
---
Lol dude you just make arguments to run yourself in circles. Everything you keep saying contradicts yourself. Have a good one.
---
Old areas in GW2 also have downscaling which is an alright idea on paper but I don't personally like it because if you can't find anyone to kill elites and you are a class that can't solo them very well then you are shit outta luck. They did an alright job on keeping stuff relevant to some extent and the way PvP works is 100x better than WoW's.
---
Why don't two people with sub 40ms go test it so we can stop blaming latency.
---
&gt; I just hope someone comes up with a fancy texture mod to make the game look a little better
---
Just a warning that on official servers this is [a TOS violation](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/fba4d00f-c7e4-4883-b8b9-1b4500a402ea/blizzard-end-user-license-agreement) and could eventually [lead to a ban](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291450/model-swapping-bans-reduced-to-warnings). You are not allowed to modify the client in any way. 
---
Blizzard is from a different era.
---
As intended?
---
The problem is they level scale everything to be the same when you can level scale the mobs up another 3 levels higher than the player if you want to. They can make some quests harder or areas just by doing this.
---
Vanilla railroads you in based on your current level. Low level zones offer no XP. Higher level zones have no eligible quests. In a proper scaled system you could go anywhere and in a game that was fully built around compartmentalized quests and less zone tour quests it would be great.
---
Vanilla is such a theme park in it's quest design and level system. You have a choice of Silverpine Forest or The Barrens and it's not really a choice because you'll need to do both.
---
I have been wanting this since TBC. I played Vanilla Beta and launch. It was the best. This won’t be the same but it will be so close. Tried a pserver and it was fantastic but I knew it wasn’t legit/stable enough to invest too much time.
---
August 26-27 can’t come soon enough. There has never been a game I have anticipated more so than Classic, including Vanilla.
---
It says Offline for me and I've been sitting in realm list from like 10 minutes before the starting time so what is happening?
---
Fan service, goofy characters, and actual plot.
---
Good stuff. DBZ after the freiza saga became absolute total nonsense.
---
This looks oddly familiar.
---
Oh yeah .... same.
---
whichever you choose, it'll be the wrong option
---
Where did you hear that? They are the best tank for everything.
---
*penta kill   
---
We all know it
---
Show me one contradiction.
---
I wish this were true...
---
Like, is it more useful to try over and over or to just let it go?
---
Pservers are to be shut down upon the release of Classic. I don't get how that is a valid alternative.
---
Keep in mind there have been fully functional vanilla private servers for years now where the server starts fresh and many guilds will clear Naxx.  I never raided in true vanilla but just got to AQ40 on the private server and have cleared everything beneath that many times now.  A ton of knowledge and experience is coming from these private servers and not actual vanilla.
---
nontillion iirc
---
Ever name I make is taken?
---
Blizz : Alright, let the streamers in first, everyone else wait till it's too late
---
Yea, except layering is being removed entirely after phase two...
---
The Priest one was similar. both are brilliant honestly.
---
I got in and selected the realm. But was waiting on a blank character selection screen. I could launch the character creation screen, but nothing happened when I hit "Accept".
---
A second make-up stress test? But according to defenders here, Blizzard got all the data they needed last time when people watched a login screen for two hours. "That *was* the stress test," they said.
---
Agreed. When you play a meme spec by yourself, you're only hindering yourself.
---
When you play a meme spec in a pug 5-man, it can be annoying to your party members, but only for a short while. 
---
When you try to join a raiding guild as a meme spec you are forcing the other 39 people to spend more time in raids than is necessary, for months, to entertain your whim. If your guild has a few like you, you'll probably experience some low % wipes that would have been avoided if everyone had brought their A-game.
---
It's all just gif-makers making references to each other in flashy text.
---
I'd guess the server went down....
---
They need people to test the game, not run around at 30 PvPing.
---
Go back to elwynn forest and kill boars till i am a high enough level, then take him on in an epic battle.
---
seems to be working as intended at stressing me out and testing my patience
---
Victory rush
---
Same here on Ally Burning Blade, always knew it as VC.
---
Cringe
---
15 mins of the loading screen boss at 90% was long enough, alt+F4'd, now battling the "logging into game server" boss instead. Stress test successful again lol, ah well I'll help hammer the server now and enjoy actually playing it later.
---
rip server boys. Server=Stressed
---
Good bot.
---
Prot Warriors were the go to tanks for everything, Raids dungeons, open world bosses anything it was a Prot warrior, never seen any other class tank cept maybe druids in low level dungeons, Just dont level as Prot, its painful enough leveling as arms/fury prot will just add a new level of pain
---
Try more like 10,000+ gold
---
Exactly the same. And joining the some 300 queue now. With No servers available as an end result :-\\
---
Unpopular Opinion: States commonly held popular opinion
---
If we were invited to the first Stress Test, do we have access to this 2nd stress test?
---
Don't worry it's just a beta!!!!
---
I got in, but got a wowerror after the game did not show my corpse. Also global channels, and guild were not working. Now no online servers.
---
What a surprise.
---
Honestly if you cant see it for yourself then it's hopeless. Can't hold your hand on this one, kid.
---
Some people like support classes. I’m one of those. I’d rather have a huge arsenal of support abilities than play a mage which has a 1 button rotation at 60.
---
No realms available for me atm.
---
gasp! He stole my meme from discord! What sort of scoundrel would do that?
---
They got the data, made some changes, now they are testing these changes. Not that hard to understand, is it?
---
[Video with fastest bank alts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjA0VHOo5pU)
---
Psst: They probably aren't going to fix it.
---
I'm actually curious is that the average weapon damage? Or is base the lower part. 
---
Abilities like heroic strike add damage to your weapon damage. So in theory your next attack could roll the highest value say 154 (the high number on ww axe) plus heroic strikes added damage.
---
And on top of that it could crit. 
---
I'm wondering if that's how heroic strike works or if it adds damage to the average weapon damage. Or maybe it takes the number shown in your character sheet
---
Says the server is full with a queue time and place in line... when it reaches zero I get the No realms are currently available error... hmmm
---
Interesting, i was encountering the "logging into the sever" error but now when i back out i get placed into a queue then kicked into "No servers are currently available. (BLZ51934200)"
---
Stress tests are intended to literally do what they say, put stress on the server so they can make adjustments...etc.
---
&gt; Wasn't this added after 1.12?
---
My god you people are intolerable.
---
Thanks that was helpful - gave me a sense of how things will be run.
---
I mean. This is what we're supposed to be doing lol.
---
We did it. We killed the servers. Way to go guys.
---
This was a triumph.
---
I played from early-BC to Cata. I searched my email to find out what guild I was in, it was a more casual progression guild called Copyright, Alliance. 
---
My friend Twoskins / Twofangs was in Section 8 for a little bit I think.
---
I actually talked with Sandisk on the phone once during the Wrath launch, he seemed like he would be a cool dude irl.
---
Horde were crazy on that server, I remember CryHavoc and Popular Creeps always ganking.
---
You're trying to save face while you disengage and flee from the argument you've clearly lost and its not working so well.
---
I don't believe I've contradicted myself at all. You don't either, else you'd be trying to rub my nose in it.
---
Move along 1337 guy, better luck next time.
---
It's all about that karma. Since the game isn't even out yet there's basically nothing to post here. Such is the life cycle of the the circle jerk.
---
I got to the realm list but couldn't get into the game
---
They may not move forward with every server but they are going to move forward on some of them. The demand will be there again because as we invest time and effort into these new characters in classic, we will not want their journey to end. We will want to keep going. If there is an expansion we don't like we will stop playing and if an expansion releases that we do like we will go back to playing. But this is back at the start and we know where we are going and I am looking forward to it.
---
After normalization faster weapons aren’t nearly as bad. Still a little behind but people don’t care to look at the actual numbers they just want the highest numbers they can get. Which is why everyone still goes for the axe. 
---
Personally I hate such slow fucking swings. I rocked the sword even before normalization. Granted then it didn’t matter as much cause you weren’t going arms for sweeping strikes you were going fury.
---
Re-commenting so you see it, here's a list of all wands by level and DPS. If you level a priest, I'd strongly recommend planning out wand upgrades since so much of your DPS is based on your wand.
---

---
You're going to be one of those guys who thinks the private server meta should be used at all times even when you have no clue how different classic will be. Go play retail cookie cutter nerd.
---
&gt; id make the argument that there was a ton of fundamental problems with WoW dating all the way back to BC
---
Like what? Flying mounts are fairly frowned upon as being social world breaking and I think resilience was a terrible stat but TBC was a giant improvement for class balance over vanilla, I personally enjoyed TBC immensely to the point where I think it is hands down WoW's best expansion.                
---
              
---
Personal taste aside the popularity of WoW exploded all the way through into Cataclysm, there is always going to be people who will claim things and changes they dont enjoy but BFA isnt terrible because of changes made in TBC or Wrath, BFA is bad because of changes made in BFA.
---
Attempts are now crashed back to No realms are available, which is how it was at the beginning minutes of the stress period today.
---
Login server isn't the game server
---
I've got a different error, WOW51900309
---
careful you may be called salty xD
---
No that's r/swoosh
---
classic wont kill retail.
---
they are still going to care about retail far more than classic/tbc/wrath.
---
when you run out of content in classic what are you going to go back to? the game that has updates.
---
It's like this for me. Got invited to first, but didn't participate. Got into this one aswell, attempting to get in now.
---
Yep kept changing classes. So many 25-40ish alts
---
WOW51900309
---
He just wants you to know he's mad! If you disagree you're a dirty retail player and should just leave him alone!
---
No, because you can already do exactly that.
---
It is always worth the risk
---
Welp, stress test is working. We stressed the server to the breaking point.
---
Is anyone getting the ’We can’t find that Blizzard account’ error message?
---
Servers failing to handle the load, they really are making this like Classic! LOVE IT! xD
---
i believe 1.13 is what they are calling wow classic, like the stress test client is 1.13.2
---
hunter2
---
the most boring class to level imo apart from paladins
---
Might just be a problem on your end, Raid End gear for hunter all looks great, Dragon Stalker is amazing looking for unraid tier, everyone gets nasty looking stuff,  id say play different class if you don't like the way the gear looks and thank god for no more Transmog
---
I actually started loading ingame before they took it down
---
I'd say the game isn't really challenging but more so engaging.
---
I'm stressed
---
If the private server values line up with classic values, yes. So it will be the classic meta then. 
---
I am a guy who you know....Plays video games. There is some math involved there
---
And with "no changes" that math ain't changing from the day it goes live probably. 
---
If you wanna play a game with some mystery to it go play a live server. Classic isn't for you. No excuse not to know what is going on in an MMO like classic that will have no balance changes. THere is nothing to keep up with.
---
Yes but if you look at the actual math the difference post normalization is minimal.
---
prepare your anus.
---
haha same
---
I do want to add that either way less people are trying to log in this time as opposed to the last stress test or Blizz did actually implement some changes that sped up the authentication process and is causing lower queues.  I was pretty consistently around 2700-3100 in queue for a good portion of time at stress test #1.  Now I seem to be in the 200-400 range every time I cycle through.
---
Never got in, server seems to be offline.
---
I know. I think it's funny that my place in line gets determined by how many are getting disconnected.. lol
---
I don't think scaling is the problem. It's that the lvling experience isn't the core of the game anymore.
---
It's all about the end game now. In Vanilla, lvling to 60 itself was an achievement to most people, now it's expected for everyone to be Max lvl in a week or so after an expansion releases. 
---
I think scaling is a good solution to what Retails current core gameplay is.
---
No you're the guy who googles how to play video games
---
There are no Chores, I mean dailies in Vanilla.
---
There's only several specific cats with a 1. 2 attack speed. I think the highest cat with that attack speed is the Swamp Jaguar in Swamp of Sorrows level 36-37.
---
i got to this point... then it went down. was so hopeful
---
 I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS.
---
Gonna have to make a note here: "Huge success"
---
That's not really the point. That person with t2 could put on some crappy blue gear to fool you into attacking him. Transmog does not jive with vanilla.
---
after realm list there's still character selection  :D you can get stuck there too
---
Hey Dalaran, my mom
---
Well that sucks ass. I'll just go play something else.
---
It will probably be like last time to where most of us will be unable to login until around midnight tonight. I was unable to login for 5 hours last time and around midnight I was able to login and make a character.
---
Thats the one I'm getting
---
I definitely hope thats the case, though some of this may be because its earlier.  More of the country is still at work right now and cant really be around to test.
---
What series of events ended up with you talking to him on the phone? He was an interesting human lmao. I remember him constantly being in trade chat and on the server forums. Interesting to hear seemed to be a normal, level headed person when you spoke with him.
---
The difference in damage is a joke post normalization.
---
Also sword spec &gt; axe spec and that’s not even taking into account the human racial for swords.
---
It was considered grieving on PvE servers if you did it while not PvP tagged. And was bannable offense.
---
I'm always within a 50 to 300 range!
---
Rogueis a super strong class and you'll enjoy it if you want to play rogue. A good.rogue can beat any class. A good rogue with proper gear can easily beat any class.
---
Gonna be honest, wasn't expecting their login systems to be what seems to be having the most trouble with these stress tests.  Figured they'd be able to implement whatever retail has been using for xpack/patch launches and the main problems would be figuring out layering/sharding when everyone is still in the noob zones, not being simply unable to connect at all.
---
Ah well, it's what these tests are for.
---
Less people, majority are still at work
---
For alot of players..it was the first useful trinket you got. Trinkets where quite rare and sometimes..not useful to your class. Carrot on a stick was useful for everyone and made a big difference while levelling.
---
I would expect them released just before the 12th, not much before though. All they said was that realm names would be released by the time character creation was available.
---
Less US people, sure, but what about those in other countries that this time slot may be better?
---
As a beta should be. The issue is when these reported bugs still make it to the live version
---
You got me. It's totally not the fact that I'm on mobile and dont want to go back and forth for examples while formatting to make it easy for you to follow. Damn, you got me dude.
---
irrelevant question but can you still play ffxi roughly as it was back then? really interested by this one too
---
I was like 9 years old and just killed mobs and didn't quest from like 15 to 40 because I thought figuring out where shit was made it less efficient. I also didn't loot any grey or white items.
---
Where's the BIS-spreadsheet? :)
---
RIP Hootie, may you rise again!!!

But that won't have the sweet level 30 meta we're missing out on.  Or the level 40 and 50 metas that may come in the next couple of months.
---
Same here
---
Sweet thanks appreciate it.
---
I got in but character is stuck - can't move.  Looks like servers are overloaded or something.
---
Looking at streamers, they're getting to the character creation screen, but not in
---
This sub went from Office memes to Vanilla circle jerking so fast!
---
Half the posts are just people agreeing or arguing.
---
I think I need to unsub and just turn to Wowhead for news.
---
Awesome, thanks for letting me know!  I just added it to both the Google Doc and the main Reddit post.
---
Got to play a few hours afterward but still a bitter experience, i was hyped to try it out and... Spend hours on the logging screen.
---
Kinda like what i'm doing right now
---
if my memory is right, people always cced in 60 dungeons. face rolling is for current wow expansion. and low level dungeons are ament to be fairly simple its to let people learn the game and to just enjoy killing things in a group, ofc with the current few expansions crop of players deadmines might prove 2 hard.
---
esfandPls ONE BOOMKIN WITH THE MAGES esfandPls
---
No problem man!  I mostly made it because I wanted something like this for my own reference, but couldn't find one comprehensive enough online.
---
Server died.. im stuck buffing myself in goldshire :(
---
I'm in the same boat as you.
---
Hi, /u/EncoreWeed
---
I have a long comment in this thread explaining how some parts of Wowhead require the Classic addon for information on droprates and maps, but a few people have pointed out inconsistencies with private server sites related to weapons, and I can also vouch that the experience/reputation for starting zone quests is wrong on those sites.
---
Classic Wowhead could only really start development when the beta came up, datamining with no game access only goes so far, so any private server site will have an initial advantage of looking more complete, even if there are errors like mob damage or exzperience.
---
Realm names will not be the same, but you can try to find your old guildies here https://www.vanillafriends.com/
---
People are just nitpicking the most minute details for the sake of it. Even if it was "1.13," why would anyone NOT want it to be in the game?
---
Was able to log into the server just now and choose my character from the previous stress test.  Logged in, got instantly bounced to a graveyard, and then proceeded to an infinite loading screen.  Trying again now and getting stuck at "Logging in to game server."  
---
I don't mind though, it's kind of fun to see how the server reacts to all this load.  I'm hoping they learn a lot from these tests, especially with the new layering tech.
---
Hunter sets are my fav fam
---
No I mean, where can I find out what this is? Also I agree with you but I just don't understand what this is. Like how does 30 vs 29 change the amount of PvP? (Honest question).
---
Also what happens to all the level 30 characters? Are they just not usable anymore?
---
Edit: the reason I asked if it's a joke is I don't see any other source talking about this so I thought maybe it might be a GM joking (which does happen sometimes).
---
&gt; I'm actually curious is that the average weapon damage? Or is base the lower part.
---
Base is whatever you roll within the range. It could be anything from 102-154 for the axe. I used the top roll possible for both weapons in my example.
---
&gt;I'm wondering if that's how heroic strike works or if it adds damage to the average weapon damage.
---
I'm not certain but I **think** heroic strike just adds X onto your damage once it's been calculated, I'm fairly sure it doesn't add to your base, but it wouldn't make any difference if it did. It's worth noting by the way that the slower your weapon is, the more heroic strike effectively costs.
---
Since the cost of heroic strike (depending on talents) is 15 + lost rage not gained through a swing. So even if heroic strike did increase the base, it would increase the base by X equally for both weapons except it would artificially cost more rage on a slower weapon.
---
The same applies here for the crit argument, saying "It could crit" applies to both weapons equally.
---
Got a link?
---
It's crazy how going back to your roots reinvigorates these kind of games. Just look at Old School Runescape. Now for Ever quest classic.
---
Who hit 60 in Un'goro? It's a bit low for that... you'd be better of in EPL or Silithus once questing was implemented there. They're higher level zones.
---
4Head
---
Yeah that's what I assumed the post was going to be about. Last time I played was in Legion as a feral druid. My rotation was so overly complex, I had to watch for so many procs, had to manage my energy perfectly, all while being pummeled with Deadly Boss Mods warnings and timers and about 100 complex boss mechanics. The amount of time I actually got to look at the world was maybe 10%, the rest was spent staring at different UI elements and planning every single button press.
---
Now don't get me wrong, I chose that by picking a feral druid, but I really miss simplicity. I want to be able to see the raid this time.
---
\&gt;Thinking beta in 2019 means anything but pre-release marketing
---
Priest 35% chance to avoid casting interruption with heals.
---
I was able to move after about 30 seconds, but then my game crashed when I clicked on the social button. Hard crash too, the kind that brings up the blizzard crash form.
---
im actually in, but cant do anything. i killed 2 wolves and then the server died
---
Same realized no keys were key bound even the movement keys. I had to bind them myself but then I got booted now I’m stuck at logging in to game server
---
Totally right but I feel youre going to get downvoted.
---
The blizzard classic team have been great so far bringing us back classic. What they may not be great at is bringing us anything that isnt truly classic, I.e. layering
---
Pre-patch 3.3.5 Wrath still had its roots of "Classic era". I make the argument that patch 3.3.5 was literally the day WoW died. Still overall Wrath was a great expansion fondly remembered in many peoples hearts.
---
It had years of content updates, so of course it feels like a complete game!
---
Dungeons and quests were added to fill out the leveling experience. Flight paths and graveyards were sprinkled around the world. Silithus was little more than an empty desert of rich thorium nodes that didn't even have Cenarion Hold before patch 1.8 (and no flight path before 1.3!). Outdoor raid bosses were introduced. And so on.
---
An interesting aspect of Classic will be that it won't be the original vanilla experience because they're starting with 1.12 rather than updating through all those content changes.
---
I am, www.twitch.tv/kala &lt;3
---
Got in and ran from Stormwind back to Northshire.  Had to reload my UI as everything was bugged to hell, and I've been casting Demon Armor for the duration of the whole run - no NPCs loading.
---
Edit: Booted out as of now.  Server toast
---
What is the point of buffing leveling instances?  You can just do it earlier to make it harder.  Or 2-man it, etc.
---
The problem is not that he's on another side, the problem is that he's the kind of guy you don't want on your side.
---
Yeah it's kind of stupid that I helped take down the Lich King, Deathwing and fucking Sargeras himself.. but got overwhelmed by a group of kobold in a mine in Elwynn Forest. We want to feel powerful after our adventures.
---
Mirror match GO!
---
Imagine wanting to stop that
---
i dont think we should have powerful artifacts. We should just be players caught up in something bigger than us with regular gear.
---
I've been thinking for a while what retail needs is to start from level 1 again. Find a way to make it so we don't lose all our old character progress and achievements, make up some lore that makes sense.
---
But the idea that I'm supposed to get hyped for new content thats piled on top of 120 levels of old content got so stale for me. And if you wanted to make a new character it was pointless to not pay or use a free boost to skip most of the crap anyways.
---
He wanted to see what it dropped, he said so in the video. It's a rare mob, it doesn't count towards any quests.
---
It's a social game, want your experience to be good? Make friends to group with who are of similar skill and mindset.
---
If you want to be sloppy and don't mind repairing in the middle of a dungeon, find other players who want that. You'll reap what you sow. But no one is likely to say anything about how terribly you're gimping the group when no one in teh group is making an effort lol
---
Trust me I would never invite randoms into my voice server...haha
---
Like I said you want friends with similar skills and mindesets in the context of the game....If they don't have that you're not really compatible from a game play perspective. Thus you should just not waste your time and avoid them. It's the reason you got picked last for kickball.
---
Your daddy shoulda taken a belt to you to teach you the importance of winning, hahaha
---
If you have to ask why it's important to win a game you're playing, there is something wrong with you boi
---
Holy crap your daddy must not be happy with you
---
also it has a more satisfying way of displaying crit I think, hard to explain this, I think they altered it in wod
---
The fact that the end game was in a different continent removing the coherent world like it was in vanilla. and yeah flying mounts suck
---
Well it is a stress test. The added 24 hours are a bonus.. so why bitter?
---
&gt; Still a little behind but people don’t care to look at the actual numbers they just want the highest numbers they can get. Which is why everyone still goes for the axe.
---
Well if the calculation examples I used are correct, you would get higher numbers with the sword as a human in PvE and almost identical numbers in PvP.
---
Fr I'm still mad about taking out Mark of the Wild
---
Tipsout is an idiot and a liar.
---
I’m finally back to character creation. Same problem.
---
same, stuck in buffing myself
---
No, they said it will between a few weeks and maximum the duration of phase 1. They never said it will definitely be the entirety of phase 1.
---
No way. I acquired this within the first few months of release of vanilla. I very vividly remember because it took me a fucking day lol
---
The feeling when you keep a potion you found just in case you might need it. 
---
Later actually needing it and it save you a run from the graveyard. 
---
*Classic Feels Intensifies*
---
Awesome thanks!
---
I seem to recall the Legion and BFA launches seeming really smooth, though I don't remember if I was trying to get in right at launch or not.  But it definitely felt better than prior expansions.  I think WoD was smooth too, though sort of bottle necked by opening quests
---
I haven't heard the idea before so I'll give you that at least. It just sounds a lot messier to achieve the exact same thing as the 'obvious' solution though - new TBC realms with free copies from the Vanilla realm. The only real difference is instead of logging out and back into a TBC server you just have a drop down menu or place in game that lets you chose between which one to play on.
---
I got past the login boss after multiple wipes, now I'm at the character creation boss. It's not looking good, Accept button no workee.
---
I thought Blizz said we would still have our characters from the original stress test?
---
ETA: missed the hover text that said the world would be available *Soon*
---
Well are you going to pvp?
---
I would say race choices definitely gimps you in PVP, usually not so much in PVE because there it's just a numbers game, doing a bit more dps or healing, but in pvp it can make the difference between winning or losing the 1v1.
---
this is exactly what bliz wants you to do. :&gt;
---
Lok'tar ogar, brother.
---
Old viral nerdgasm over vent
---
Don't worry about it, there will always be new guilds forming or guilds recruiting, the pre-made guilds will most likely fall apart or will need more people to fill raid slots.
---
 \*Insert "he is just trying to kiss our asses" comment\*
---
I'd imagine it's to promote 20-29 as the highest pvp bracket for honor system testing.
---
That's odd I can't choose my characters from last time. Have to make a new one and am stuck at character creation screen and unable to click *accept*
---
Aren't keyboard hotkeys saved to server now? so it wasn't that they weren't bound but just hadn't been loaded yet.
---
Mine was there, hit log in and got stuck on loading screen at \~80%
---
What are you planning to do outside of a dungeon?
---
Ahh, I wonder why they would invite him then
---
No, in my early WoW developmental stages I was mostly ganked by gnomes and dwarves.  Kill 'em all.
---
The haste is very nice on trolls, even in pvp - personally I will go Orc for the stun resist but that will only proc so often, and when it does not a troll would be better in the same scenario, so go with what you enjoy :)
---
Yeah I'm right here with ya. I allowed myself a glimmer of hope once I successfully made it to the realmlist, but it was dashed quite expertly by this screen.
---
Could level cap items so that you could only use them until level 69 or something like that so that you have to re-gear with new world stuff to raid.
---
Prot will stay winning.
---
Send me a DM before launch day dude. Our guild is taking newbies.
---
lol there were/are tons of reputations to grind, depending on what your after
---
Thanks for the comment.  
---
Yeah i'm going to play pvp, not grinding r14 or anything but i will for sure play alot. That being said i just cant stand the orc animations.
---
How is it not a change if its done silently?
---
Of course not, it's just a joke.
---
Hahahaha Hahahaha. Imagine getting this worked up because someone put two talents in the wrong place.
---
If you have to min max in WoW in a non-hardcore environment it is reasonable to assume you’ve never won anything outside the game.
---
Ooooooof
---
Yeah you’re correct about 30 seconds after I bound movement keys all my binds loaded in
---
None.
---
You think you don't, but you do.
---
agree :(
---
He is just trying to kiss our asses.
---
I did when I got that far, can't make it to character creation now though.
---
Ok fine. But it's my turn to repost it next damnit!
---
Then I guess it's just me. When I played vanilla as a priest there weren't any pallys that could single target heal better than I could. Now, that did change with the expansions but in pure vanilla priests were better.
---
 OMG WHY CAN I NOT LOG IN!?
---
Yeah but the argument has nothing to do with classic. People are just saying why ratings are/arent necessary. I agree the gearing in retail is bad, but the discussion is just over the numbers/display not how to fix all of retails gearing problem
---
Can you find me a quote that would lead you to believe that layering will be in phase 2?
---
My comment was more directed at u/Mechanon84 implying I'm being toxic or something with the intolerable comment. I was honestly asking a question and he comes in acting all offended at me being toxic when that in no way was the intent. I even found correct information and shared it as well with an edit. Vanilla was over a decade ago, memories go bad a lot quicker than most want to believe, hence my original question.
---
cant it be both ?
---
Another tip that i didn't learn and felt embarrassed when i did.
---
A player does not have to be in your party to be soulstoned by you.
---
On private servers i would get whispers offering money for it but they never wanted to accept my invite to a group. I'm so bad.
---
This is really annoying. As an IT Infrastructure engineer IRL - i'm wondering what they've possibly changed since last time? As others have said - i don't understand why its the login and game servers that are causing this. That's the part that should be easy for them - it's the Layering tech that needs really testing.
---
Quite worried about this guys NGL :/
---
No that has literally nothing to do with anything.
---
I don't like tips because he is representing the classic community poorly and spreads lots of miss information and overall just puts us in a bad light. That's it.
---
https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw just saying
---
I never used it for damage or experience, just locations of things, which is what most are going to use it for. My main issue with WoWhead is the massive adds all over it, and all the other stuff that seems like it takes up more space that needed when it doesn't apply to Classic WoW. It's more effort than it's worth to even find the info on the page you are looking at when I can just look at one of the others I mentioned and it's the first thing I see.
---
Men people that dont even understand what a stress test is gonna drag down the whole expirience until they go back to retail -.-
---
Why can't I log in?
---
Because Blizzardvision hates me.
---
Long time player / old account, never said anything bad about any state of the game (even though I'm not a huge fan of BfA), my sub may not have been consecutive since 2004, but I have subbed to world of warcraft every year since 2004.  
---
Yet I haven't gotten an invite to either the beta or to the stress test(s).  
---
Yeah, pretty sure they hate me.
---
sure. i'm not expecting to get a bunch of heals dumped into me if i'm gimping my own incoming healing. but in most situations it wont really matter as long as you aren't using it in a critical moment. i have low expectations of healers most of the time, so I'm going to play 100% self preservation likely unless its mega farm content. dead dps is 0 dps
---
sapping healers ftw
---
Stuck at logging into game server...
---
[We are now at the beta stage.](https://i.imgur.com/s2nMMmS.jpg)
---
That's not what they wrote when they announced this second stress test. They acknowledged people's concerns about the first stress test and openly admitted they didn't get all the data they wanted.
---
Where did he say he didn't want it in?  You read what you wanted to read
---
You aren't going to be questing once you ding 60, and world bosses you will be tanking.
---
I'm wondering if they're intentionally using less server capacity to simulate a super heavy load.  I'm sure they could throw more at it, but I'm guessing they'd like to see how it will react in a worse case scenario.  Only guessing though, I don't deal with servers in my day to day!
---
Correct.
---
On the beta reputation currently decays as you outlevel quests. The most effective way to gain rep is to head to the desired race's starting zone around level 4-6 and quest as much in their zones as possible. 
---
On pservers, this typically allowed people to hit exalted somewhere from 40-50. Classic Beta, however, has much lower reputation gains than pservers and it's possible (or even likely) that characters would hit 60 without reaching exalted and still need to do the runecloth grind. 
---
Questing in the desired races zones while at the appropriate level still reduces a large chunk of the runecloth grind.
---
Out of curiousity, what makes you say that?
---
Deadly throw?&gt;?????
---
I'll be doing a mix of dungeons and PvP, not much end game content. I'm thinking Druid or Shaman, as I like the ability to fill healer / tank roles for 'queue times', and I'm trying to avoid the most popular classes like rogue/warrior/mage if possible. If I had to go with one of those classes I would probably pick mage, as I haven't spent too much time with the class and they seem very fun to play.
---
Some important points: I will be leveling with 1 or 2 people almost at all times. I'm leveling with a clothie and would prefer not to roll one of those classes, unless that's not really something I should be too worried about.
---
**My thoughts on the classes:**
---
**Druid:** Can queue as healer or tank, great in WSG for flag carrying. DPS is mediocre, as is tank spec at high level. Lots of utility for PvP, stealth is always a plus.
---
**Hunter:** Never interested me, and super popular.
---
**Mage:** Seems fun, also very popular though. High dps, good set of abilities for PvP. Can make portals and mage water, has party buffs. Pairing with my priest friend would be sub-optimal for sharing all gear.  
---
**Paladin:** Horde FTW.
---
**Priest:** My buddy is playing a priest already, not interested in going that route.
---
**Rogue:** This was an original choice for me, as it was my first character, but again there will be a million rogues. Theyre awesome in PvP and dungeons/raids. Stealth is awesome. They can't heal or tank so queue times will be a big bust.
---
**Shaman:** My second character, and a less popular choice for most people. I hear Ele is great in PvP, and Enh can sometimes delete clothies with WF procs, however rare. They can heal dungeons which is a nice plus for me. Totems are super unique and a fun addition to the class.
---
**Warlock:** An interesting choice, don't know too much about them in vanilla other than their raiding is gimped by debuff limits. Good in PvP, can summon, has healthstones and soulstones. Fun class lore and an interesting candidate. Pairing with my priest friend would be sub-optimal for sharing all gear.
---
**Warrior:** Probably going to be one of the most played along with mages/rogues. Great tanks, was one of my first thoughts for classic. Good in PvP with a healer or group, leveling sucks but everyone wants a tank. Great dps overall.
---
I didn't necessarily mean *ranking*, just that if you're a god-tier player of "insert class", your server will recognize you as such. Just look at the pserver community. 
---
You're right though, ranking is just a nolife timesink. I should have clarified.
---
&gt; n i kept getting the message that the name i wanted was already taken, and i tried a bunch of different spellings for it (not a common name either). anyone else have this problem?
---
yea
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I hadn't thought about Enchanting. I guess that would arguably be more useful for the Druid for the tank trinket. What's your opinion on LW though? You think a shaman would benefit from it?
---
Did that. Now I have a black screen and an empty character list but the *Enter world* button appeared and can be clicked. Nothing happens though.
---
It says *The world is scheduled to be available soon*
---
The guy is moving in the first 2 seconds of the vid.
---
After doing some dungeons as a warrior I see Stam buff druid buff and possibly windfury.  They probably see battle shout and don't like me if I'm not tanking though but of course I'd be tanking in a dungeon.  Gonna start as dps if i make it to raid
---
Does Stanley have a mustache?
---
Just got an "error creating character" error after clicking accept on char creator. :(
---
Sure, I just wanted to share my memory too! I remember finally equipping it after what felt like proper work, and not seeing any difference lol
---
I am not saying they will move the resources they save on cutting BFA to Classic necessarily. But if they can't justify investment for BFA because of lack of interest then they won't continue to develop it, much like what happened to HotS E-sports.
---
If they stop developing Retail after the next expansion (which they are probably already working on), then I would consider that cannibalism. Even if all the resources aren't transferred to Classic. You have to remember this company has a HUGE stable of games and funds are fungible.
---
Well i don't blame Blizzard for this, it's the very goal of the stress test. 
---
But it just doesn't feel nice to have a lot of expectation for the game and can't manage to even reach the caracter selection menu for two whole hours.
---
Anyway, here i am doing the exact same thing. Hope i'll reach the menu this Time :p
---
Yep me too :|
---
hi DAn
---
But that's not testing how it is in vanilla, as there's still a 50-59 bracket and a 60 bracket, just as there's a 20-29 bracket, and a 30 bracket. 
---
Is there a blue post on this somewhere that explains it?
---
Not only FPS, but resolution... I think I was rocking the 12" monitor and while raiding as a priest, I got to see a bunch of lines get longer and smaller from time to time while zoomed in and facing a wall.  I only moved for LOS issues or to dodge attacks.
---
Play your undead man, the difference isn't that big of a deal. Undead racial has times it will shine too, you don't have to rely on pvp trinket everytime you get feared or charmed (and there is no pvp trinket during phase 1 so thats an advantage too)
---
That's entirely possible.  I did my best to forget about that expansion
---
I didn't necessarily mean ranking, just that if you're a god-tier player of "insert class", your server will recognize you as such. Just look at the pserver community. 
---
I don’t want one idiot speaking for me. You doing this is giving him a worse imagine. I don’t think he would want you putting his name out there along with your attitude.
---
Try not to do any flips on the way to the parking lot.
---
Alright, thanks for answering!
---
I’m not sure about the framing of the question. A raid takes the same amount of time for everyone. Getting consumables for the raid may take more time as a tank due to more group based gold making requirements (eg strat live runs versus independently aoe farming BRD as a mage). 
---
The other aspect to consider with tanking, if you do so with a guild, is your attendance is much more important. A DPS is more replaceable than a tank.
---
to me, the separate server approach seems 'messier'. that's two separate versions of the game that need to be maintained simultaneously (three including retail), with two separate sets of servers, versus integrating them both into the same UI. i guess the swapping gearsets and the boundaries would feel messy too, you're right, but it keeps everything under the same WoW Classic client
---
I assume he's trying to say that Blizzard has a poor track record of fixing bugs that are in beta, which they are, but I think this dev team distinguishes itself from the retail team very well.
---
Where could I find info on what kind of build they typically go? I enjoy druids QoL and happy to go resto as that’s what I played retail.
---
Somewhat worrisome that they only take 1-2, but other things may make up for it.
---
I hate when people get the defcon thing wrong. It counts down not up. DEFCON 5 is peace. DEFCON 1 is war. It irks me when people get that wrong.
---
No, they like you. I can tell because you aren't being tortured with an eternal login screen to just a stress test. lol
---
Only XIV actually stuck to me. But I was an heavy XI player.
---
Still think It's the best pve game atm though.
---
They took them out because you were obligated to only invite classes to raids that offered buffs. Many classes that were subpar and offered nothing often got cut from rosters.
---
Every guild I was in always had the paladins healing the tanks because they were the most efficient at keeping the tank up. The paladin in my guild almost never needed any help. I played a priest for a few months and couldn’t keep up with the paladin who was healing single target. Suppose it depends on the player.
---
There's nothing preventing the two from jiving, but many people are against it from a nostalgia standpoint.
---
Thanks. 
---
Looks like I gotta grind out Leggionaire in pvp for the 4 piece then. OP flag runner for real.
---
While I don't think this should be allowed in classic, I always thought that transmog should have been implemented this way instead. It could still work though an in-game interface (maybe even requiring you to own the gear too), but it would be entirely client-side; basically just a fancy texture pack editor. It's a win-win situation: No transmog for those who don't want to see it, yes transmog for those who do.
---
Thanks dude :)
---
The stress test invitation told people to level up to 5, not stare at a login screen because of getting put into a "Fake Connect" group while the streamers held a media event with the devs. Blizzard admitted in the announcement for the second stress test that they didn't get all the data they wanted, and they acknowledged people's concerns. I get that some people will never admit they were wrong, but they were wrong.
---
Finishing up zones for achievements
---
How about no more Rat-man posts. That would be nice.
---
Is that example from vanilla or a private server?
---
I only ask because pserver rep quests award considerably more rep than the classic beta currently is.
---
I wish I knew, let me know if you find out!
---
I don't blame you for that haha
---
We both will in around 1-2 hours :P
---
Oh lordy, the white-knight pre-gaming has begun.
---
The people who need to see the message aren't going to see it.
---
Spock is about to kill Spock!
---
Lol this idea that randoms would be better testers than streamers is kinda stupid and just sounds like pandering.  
---
The problem is that sitting in a queue and getting d/c'd for an hour straight is a very frustrating process, and seeing streamers just log straight in and play is understandably very annoying for someone that just wants to log in and see the game for the first time.
---
Unfortunately no... just sayin' :(
---
I heard gnome isn’t good for protection
---
Oh excellent! See this makes sense to me. I was surprised multiple people acted as if this wasn't a joke here. Good stuff :).
---
This is my same exact experience. It’ll be a homecoming for me
---
"content creator" LOL
---
repeating what everyone else says and dragging it out into a 10 minute monetized video is NOT considered creating content. fuck tipsout
---
That still is a big mess.  half a guild on one realm, half on another.  Also, they have never talked about how they would handle this problem, there is no interview to watch about that, stop being a pretentious dick.
---
I will! Thanks bro
---
If I’m gonna play this gotta play it the way I first did
---
None that I know of. Good chance it was a tongue-in-cheek remark as others are saying. I was just giving a shot-in-the-dark type guess.
---
I provided my priest green gear around lvl 10. I got from 10 to 17 pretty quick and easy. I can let you know how the rest of the grind goes later. 
---
Though just like with my capped warrior. Find a friend. You will have a better time.
---
Shit dont work, end of thread
---
I got in for a short while and managed to kill Sarkoth + 4 boars until I got booted out. Can't get in anymore.
---
It's 2019 bro. There is a whole industry called IT centered around googling. Hahaha

---
I was watching some random pvp vid of retail the other day and this hunter was critting for 75,000+ and in my head I'm thinking that's insane.. definitely a 1 shot, nope did like a quarter of the person's hp lol
---
I just sit constantly on the "Logging in to game server" screen. I'm not even getting dc'ed or anything, just sitting here.
---
IF &amp; SW &gt; Mud hut ghetto of OG
---
It will be mostly Berserking and regen vs Stun Resist vs +hp and Stomp  
---
Stun Resist is by default pretty insane in PvP but the other options aren't useless either. I'm probably rolling Tauren Shaman as my alt.
---
Perhaps the login troubles are a result of layering tech. They're trying to assign folks to layers on login based on the server's current pop, etc. and having hiccups.
---
The Sentinels was mine and my irl friends first guild. So fun to see that name around!
---
Does anyone know if you keep your level 5 characters?
---
I have to assume that they are purposefully not using their developed tech for the login/game servers to do some sort of testing, as I agree, the issue has never been getting onto a server. Or possibly they're trying some sort of new tech in their server setup and it's not going well. 
---
I had fully expected that this time we'd be logging in but there'd be other major issues with the layering and server latency and such.
---
Or it just didn't happen on his server
---
They were still available
---
Yea just blah blah blah your wife that says video games are an addiction. Sounds like a good marriage.
---
It’s a video game. There’s hundreds of things that should be priority to you before playing video games.
---
Fuck layering
---
I was a bartender, 21 years old. 
---
I met my wife at a bar. We partied all night.
---
She is a sexy blonde, ukraine, 10/10. 
---
After we partied and I took her home... she went on my computer, and asked what wow was. 
---
I acted like my friend installed it, and that I had no idea what it was. 
---
I grabbed us drinks, and when I came back... she was logged into her level 60 mage. 
---
We ended up leading a 250 player guild together, getting married and having 3 kids. 
---
I cannot help you, my wife will be playing with me, and my 10 year old can help us dps now.
---
Video games are a hobby and form of relief just like watching TV, or woodworking, or stamp collecting, or whatever else you want to say. You an debate the merits of one hobby over another, but when you boil it down that's what they are. 4-5 hours per week is less than an hour a day. Calling that an addiction is misrepresenting the issue. Do you spend more than an hour a day watching tv once the kids go down? 
---
She has an outdated view of video games. It's the way our parents (those of us that are in the millennial range) thought of them and the way their parents thought of tv. Trying to carefully lay out that it's a hobby you enjoy and would like to pursue while not interfering with time you would normally spend with her. As with anything in life, you have to strike a balance. I'm sure your wife also has hobbies that don't involve you. Try to get her to see this as she sees those. They're essentially the same thing.
---
Dude, I don't care about raids. I play warlock because they are strong in PvP and because I like their playstyle. And I will find a spot regardless because I will be among the first group of people who will get to 60. Also, locks are always in demand because of summons, healthstones, soulstones etc. and their damage scales up quite nicely after the first couple raid tiers.
---
You PvE players are so simple-minded and only care about endgame raiding, even though it's one of the most boring parts of the game. 
---
I will be raiding purely to get better gear so that I can kill carebears like you faster and more efficiently in world PvP.
---
Actually seems pretty reasonable!
---
Natures grasp + bear = Druid best lvl 10
---
They didn't mention any changes. When this second stress test was announced, they acknowledged people's concerns about the first stress test and wrote that they didn't get all the data they needed last time, so they scheduled a second test going up to level 10.
---
Contrary to what many defenders here claimed last time, it seems watching major streamers fly through the character creation screen and play with the devs while plebs were stuck at the login screen wasn't a thorough in-game stress test after all.
---
Take this time to go watch the Death Stranding release date trailer again.
---
Your wife is right, WoW is basically crack.  If you want to manage your life sytle better tell her to sit down and stfu, or roll a holy priest...
---
How many more accounts do you have that you'll use to copy-paste the same comment every 3 minutes?
---
Level scaling is a decent idea, bring able to level the zones in any order you wish. You won't outlevel a zone within that range, so you can go back and enjoy it without worrying if it will become useless just because you were enjoying another zone.
---
But the problem, the BIG problem, is that you never feel like you are getting more powerful. See that boar? It was tough to kill at level 10. I come back at level 58, same boar is still tough to kill. This neuters any sense of accomplishment.
---
What they needed were "zone buffs", that boosted hp and attack while in that zone. It would be based on completion of that zone. So you complete 25% of the zone, hp and attack are increased by 5%. Complete half the zone, 10% buff. Complete three quarters, 15%. This lets you feel like you are accomplishing something in this area, you're beating this zone. Each zone gets its own buff. You return at level 60, the monsters are noticeably easier, as they should be (as long as you put in effort to complete the zone).
---
It's rewarding for effort, which scaling lacks just by itself.
---
I remember the time i started playing in 05 i clicked spells in my spell book switching pages, my first character was a dwarf hunter and i lvl\`d to about lvl 16 in dun morogh killing mobs because i had no idea where to go or what to do.
---

Client disconnected. Tried logging in manually, and it asks for the authenticator code, as it should. But I have no authenticator request.

Logging in to game server
---
Well, it seems to me you have a problem with detection of what is imaginary and what is not, if you think that this argue is real.
---
I think this post was more about venting his personal problems and then talking about what he’ll do in his depression. Still doesn’t belong here either way.
---
Everyone quit freaking the fuck out.  It's a stress test.  The first hour or so they're gonna want to be testing certain weaknesses in their shit and that's what's going on atm.  Give it an hour or so, and you'll most likely be able to login just fine.
---
This isn't a mini-beta invite that you received.
---
That's a movie story - mate thanks I'll show this to my wife :)

Nah it was solid until Cell, that was always the planned ending (had to finish Gohan's story). Also spawned a ton of real favorites like the androids, future trunks, and Gohan ss2j while maintaining the power structure heavily. Every z fighter was important, frieza saga can't even say that, was basically just another goku arc with awkward pacing
---
&gt; My wife answer is that I'm not a responsible person, videogames are an  addiction for stupid people, blah shit blah blah. I dont know what to  do. I need arguments. Help me. 
---
Dude, what the fuck. You are an adult and talk like you need to ask your wife for permission to do what you want. Yes, of course a relationship is a 2-person endeavour, but it's just a fucking video game. If you have to ask your wife to allow you to play a videogame, then you got more problems than just lacking arguments. Don't be a doormat.
---
The invitation email told people to play the game and level up, not stare at a login screen while streamers hosted a media event with the devs. Don't blame people for trying to do what Blizzard told them to do.
---
It also shares the hallmarks of CRZ.  
---
CRZ: combines players from multiple realms into a single zone, ensuring that you rarely see the same person twice while leveling.
---
Layering: shuffles players among multiple realm-sized layers, ensuring that you rarely see the same person twice while leveling.
---
I still don't see why people defend this altered implementation of CRZ, unless these same people would defend CRZ itself if Blizzard decided to implement it.
---
perhaps this might be part of what we were brought into test, especially since this test wasn't exactly planned from the beginning. Just a thought
---
Yoooo fellow Vanilla Sargeras player! Good server. Played a ridiculous amount of PVP
---
I was a Gnome mage named Amnesiac
---
They are purposefully blocking logins to acquire data
---
The couple times I've gotten to the server select screen, it showed (1) characters on the realm in addition to my Beta characters showing up - though the Beta servers are offline.
---
Enter code manually
---
Yes, but all quest NPCs had gray question marks, couldn't speak to anyone. Could cast and kill mobs before the server went down.
---
I’ve had this problem with modern arch and ubuntu on two different machines, 8 and 16gb ram.Leave it overnight or even for a couple hours with maybe 5-10 tabs open and it’s gonna devour all the memory.  🤷‍♀️
---
Of course not, but that's really not the point. If you know your route and others don't - you get ahead. If you know your route better/have a better route - you get ahead.
---
Server after server, the same people, myself included, get ahead long before Day 1's first logouts. Like, within 6-8 hours the same people who know what they're doing are ahead of the pack every time.
---

&gt; Stellaris: One Campaign
---
Based on my experience with the game that's your whole summer right there. Or, I guess you could not be a habitual restarter like I am.
---
The TBC prepatch was busted in so many ways. Water Elemental could legit solo people.
---
Good grief that's sad to think about.
---
If you really think half of the content in /r/classicwow isn’t just circlejerking about how much better and “harder” vanilla is compared to retail.. ur delusional
---
MC and Ony were never hard. We remember it being hard because WoW was most of our first MMOs. Even with 8 debuff slots it will still be on farm on every server within month 1. Reasonable people will agree this was a compromise worth giving up.
---
Well and the Edgehog named Cold Steel.
---
yeah, I'd imagine that's around where peoples alts don't really matter much.
---
If you're 470 there's zero chance that's a mandatory raiding alt. And an even lower chance (lol) that it's an alt used for split etc runs or class stacking.
---
I wholeheartedly agree with you! I have the same feelings. World was complete. If you're looking at any expansion, their world is complete too, but only that expansion world. Old world is just something for achievements, not really relevant. And Classic world is huge! 2 continents of few dozens zones!
---
Back then it felt like your toon was growing up, with every level with every new zone you where not only gaining experience but you where growing wiser.  At 60 meeting a new faction to rep grind for was like discovering a long lost tribe.  It mattered that you where honoured with the waterlords it mattered that the argent dawn was around.  It all mattered.  The rep grind actually meant something you got a bigger discount, your city factions meant you could buy mounts ( we couldn't afford them but hey).  Epics actually where epic not only to earn but to have.  
---
I remember the first time I saw someone with a thunderfury and I was in awe, absolute awe inspiring moment it was because this dude was legendary.  My first MC raid was so memorable.  I ground out everything I could to make the last little piece of fire resistance gear and the morning of the raid I was up  early to make sure I had enough of everything and I was an hour early to the raid.  4 hours of elementals and core hounds, Epic boss battles and just my leaf at the end.  I didn't care that I got no gear I didn't care that we wiped 9 times on ragnaros.  We had won, we completed it, we where battered we where poor but we made it Ragnaros was dead and we had lived.  
---
August 27th can't come quick enough.  I want my game back
---
what private servers have a lvl 30 cap?
---
I think a lot of people are interested in playing this strange and different meta that currently exists only in the classic beta.
---
I agree with you that pservers are like 95% the same as retail vanilla, but there's more to it than that.
---
Looking at the symptoms of what we're seeing it looks like the actual login servers are performing their function -&gt; The login ques are going down much faster than they did last week. They've either increased the volume of load balanced log in servers (most likely) or increased the efficiency at which the login servers work. At this point: this is what authenticates the user access to the database (where you can make characters, access server lists etc).  
---
What seems to be the problem is what the client does once it's been authenticated - seems like the database of the game world &amp; character creations etc can't handle the load. When 100000x different queries are telling your Character Table in a database to Create Orc Warrior it's obviously not playing ball. This could be for 100 reasons - depends on how their databases are structured. Seems like they need more active places to send this Data - seems like it's all going to the one place (e.g. all data going to 1 character table in 1 database when it could be going to 100 character tables across 100 databases that all feed up to a "Master" DB).  
---
I don't think at this stage it's to do with the layering - what use is layering tech when people can't even create the character? I heavily doubt it would be implemented at this stage. Login screen perhaps, not character screen though.
---
I have no code.
---
Can't wait for classic to launch. This reddit will fill up with a bunch of people and these cancerous pricks will be the minority.
---
You're right. Still a great zone though.
---
No code because there was no request.
---
It was actually a three-way phone call with one of my now ex gf's. I think we just starting talking to him on /w and party with him and such, then we got his number.
---
Yeah he would do some... interesting things... I remember him ordering people to bow before him in Stormwind and stuff.
---
Was fun playing with him out in Borean Tundra for a little bit actually seeing him play the game.
---
Yeah I never got my skeletal horse until cataclysm. I quit playing for a couple months and came back to find that a gold seller had hacked my account. I was able to get my account back and had a few thousand gold on it. So I went on a bit of a spending spree and then put the rest of the gold in my guild bank.

Hey I remember you and a few others in this picture, even though i played horde on AD. Don't know if you remember me but I played an undead warlock named Lucius. I think I was in one of your guilds comics even :).
---
Anyway thanks for sharing all the pictures in this thread, AD was a great server back then with a great community and even if we were opposite factions I remember many fun interactions with Alliance were we didn't just go full pvp on each other. :)
---
Btw didn't you make the hammer for the Sulfuras quest for a horde member, then transferring it via cross faction auction house?

Why are commenting on a post about raids then. You dont have any input that is worthwhile.
---
You have a Blizz employee in your guild, 100% confirmed. And he hates that guy in particular :P
---
You will be doing that but now you do what is also mentioned in that email.. the stress test
---
Lol no achievements in classic.
---
Imagine being this toxic in response to someone asking you to not be toxic.

HahahahahaHhaHH
---
He wants to get his lore master mount.
---
That's what I was thinking.  Perhaps less US but more EU.
---
Whoa, looks like a character I made finally saved! I have 1 character on the test server... but I’m trying to log back into the game.
---
Don't forget to throw pity on some fools with the MOHAWK GRENADE!!!
---
Female Undead do front flips on 1h attacks and 360s on 2h attacks. That’s my favorite aesthetic
---
Frankly, dismissing something you're excited about simply because they are not interested or don't like it, is an incredibly selfish &amp; disrespectful attitude to take.
---
You should absolutely prioritise your family &amp; work obligations ahead of playing the game.
---
However, you should be free to schedule a few hours of play, a few times a week, with no repercussions. 
---
If your wife wanted to pursue an individual interest, I'm sure you'd be supportive, right?
---
Yes, you may fall behind on some show you've been watching together, but if she cares about your individual happiness, she'll accommodate. 
---
As an aside - you can extend the invite for her to join you also.
---
Well as far as I know, holy paladins are very wanted in raids... Not only are palas loved for their buffs, a geared holy paladin is one of the best healers after priests. 
---
Yeah you end up spamming various flash of light ranks, however this is still fun as a healer as healing is really just managing health bars :)
---
If my Pala dream doesn't work, I'll consider switching to druid or shaman(RIP gold on PvP world) because ultimately hybrid classes with utility is what I love
---
so a streamer is a better player than everybody else?
---
Every community has black sheeps, people don't judge off that. But not every community has idiots like tips as their representatives. I'm not saying tips is the sole cause or anything like that. I just don't like him because he's an idiot same as how I don't like other idiots. But none cares about me ranting about random redditor.
---
Wouldn’t you make more from just vendoring the drops from DM? Or will they DE into something other than LBS
---
i dont understand the hate got prot leveling, i leveled 1-60 as prot in vanilla and sure it wasn't as fast as my mage but i didn't die anywhere near as much
---
&gt; I have to assume that they are purposefully not using their developed tech for the login/game servers to do some sort of testing
---
But do the testing results serve any purpose if they aren't going to use the same tech? Like at that point you are testing the different tech which isn't going to be used anyway.
---
Yes they do according to reports, my own experience right now (seeing (4) on the realm list from previous stress test) and blizzard also said they would inform us if they were going to wipe the characters, which they did not inform us, so that means we must be keeping them, lol. :)
---

Yep you're right instead of it being 20/80 it's 50/50
---
thing is, it seems it's actually going much worse than last time. At least some people were able to play normally last time.
---
I would be very surprised if that's the case - if it was, they would have done this the first time. They've put the level cap up to 10 and included BG's, considering these servers are only up for the next 23 hours they're not going to get much out of that level cap &amp; BG tests unless people are doing all nighters.
---
Beneficial? Mmm, at times yeah. Back then, yeah def hands down it was nice to have. Though now personally thinking engineering/mining would be a bit nicer to have. Or Enchanting/Gathering at least.

Stay best for what?
---
Progression raiding (on most fights)? Yes, otherwise Fury.
---
Farm raiding? No, Fury Warriors will win out.
---
Dungeons? Spec for dungeon tanking doesn't matter.
---
Farming? No, they'll stay pretty much the worst after healers.
---
PVP? No, they'll stay pretty much the worst.
---
You can pull a code whenever, bottom of your phone screen under "Enter code manually". It gives you the code, you don't get a code from the request.
---
I literally see no one freaking the fuck out, just calmly saying what errors they're getting.
---
The stress test goes from 2 to 4 thats why you hang in the login screen.. then like last week servers will reboot and go up for 24 hours for you to play and have fun.. also level 10 doable this time
---
Enjoy your generic fantasy city and generic dwarven city. Each Horde city is unique and soulful
---
Gotta look deeper. They’re there but they’re getting downvoted and rightfully so.
---
I have a firm grip, which is why many guilds had to implement policies for the meters to not be posted in raid or guild.
---
He's just farming karma with the whole "Calm down people" spiel.
---
since one of the major flaws casters like shaman have in pvp is stuns, yes you would be gimping yourself picking troll or tauren over an orc.  at least try the beta out as a female and male orc before you commit to leveling up as a troll.  maybe you will see they are not that bad once you play them from behind instead of to the side.  
---
overtime you probably will only have like a 15% difference in deaths since you won't always be fighting rogues, paladins, warriors and druids every fight.  some of those fights you will win by kiting effectively or they target another player and you would be taking zero damage or stuns.  but, for the times you remember dying as a troll, you may regret it when the instanced pvp comes around.  of course, there is nothing stopping you from leveling both troll and orc shamans.  the leveling up process is only about 2-3 weeks of hard non stop grinding.  you can cut this down by getting them to level 10 or 20 and start soaking up rested xp.
---
If they're trying to keep people on the same layer, having people phase between layers randomly is not the intended behavior.
---
Reading all the comments from people who don't understand what a stress test is while I'm logging in. I'd rather not be able to log in now, than not be able to log in on August 27th. I only hope that my constant login spam is helping Blizzard.
---
D'awwww you lucky bums!
---
Yes, guys, we fucking know that the login system is part of the stress test. I don't get why people feel the need to point that out over and over again. Blizzard also expressly noted that the last stress test didn't meet their expectations because not enough people could get online. Stop acting like a stress test is 100% succesful as long as the login servers get annihilated for a few hours. The actual game servers need to be stressed as well.
---
I got in twice and was able to play for about 5-10 minutes both times before being disconnected. It was very laggy and I only saw 1 or 2 other players.
---
Currently I’m stuck on the black character selection screen
---
Of course, I'm just really wondering what beta has set some sort of expectation that they are just an advertisement. At least according to the guy I'm responding to.
---
They're not trying to have people logged in and playing, they're trying to test jamming up the login servers. (At least that's my guess)
---
Contrary to popular belief, the stress test isn't actually about the servers. It's about the stress players are feeling by not being able to log in.
---
Hi, /u/puzzlehead84
---
Heal as a pally! Your 3 buttons. FL rank 3, FL Rank 5, Seal / Judge
---
Nah, I really loved having powerful weapons that we kept throughout the expansion. Ashbringer and Frostmourne? Doomhammer? That was cool. Even the new weapons were cool. Not to mention I didnt have to hunt for new weapons just to keep up with DPS, that was a nice bonus.
---
I played the shit out of Legion, had so much fun. Sadly they fucked up again in BfA. At this point I firmly believe they have no fucking clue about what they do right or wrong.
---
I think Legion did a lot of things right, especially for alts. You could collect new artifact skins, class mounts and experience other classes' order hall campaign story. It gave you a reason to level alts. Even tho with my 60 hours a week work schedule, I was able to collect most stuff for 8 characters in Legion. If I did not get the mage tower forms for Druids I'd be pretty sad, tho I was able to get it.
---
your character looks sick
---
You linked the results page, and should've just called the pre-tbc patch, "2.0"
---
We call it enter code by foot where I’m from.
---
If you look at the post they made from after the last stress test, and the logic in the difference here: the summary of it was that they didn't anticipate the specific issues they had, and it didn't go to plan, but they gained some "very valuable data for the next stress test", and as a result of how badly the 1st stress test went, with a max cap of 5, they announced an extra one (the one today)  
---
This extra one has double the level cap &amp; PVP enabled - it's pretty clear they intend for us to test this content. They are not purposefully keeping us on the login screen here, i'm almost certain of it.
---
There's going to have to be a cool down of sorts unless people accept layer hopping abuse. Not too sure what will happen.
---
Thanks, I hate it! :D
---
Just sitting here an hour after it started - watching the "logging in to game server" window! /cry

I'm doing my part

---
to be honest im a little bit afraid of raids being a bit too easy. i feel like the sense of accomplishment isnt quite that strong when MC plays out like an extended retail LFR wing. im genuinely worried about long-term fun in classic from a PvE perspective.
---
Totally agree but you'll probably get downvoted to hell because the mob here disagrees.
---
probably they changed exactly what they wanted to test? As an It infrastructure guy, you should know this :D
---
&gt; PvP specs were enough to do decently in raid.
---
Yet the best performing rogue is the one that kept the combat spec, and due to no gold, never went to BG's or participated in world PVP.
---
I went the other way, and have better memories to show for it.  
---
But yeah, for a friends and family guild that was dabbling in raiding, they did need to fund the respecs if they were going to complain about differences in output.
---
Always felt this way. That's why when my guild rerolled alliance ona fresh server I went male dwarf rogue.
---
Nah, all realms go to TBC and new realms for those that want to stay in Vanilla. No transfer allowed.
---
I was asking the person above me why he would play the most boring and broken class in the game. Thanks to you, I now realize how idiotic the PvE crowd actually is.
---
We literally have a blue post stating that this is a big and they're working on fixing it.
---
[Im doing my part!](https://imgur.com/VzSWCnA)
---
Yes there are.
---
My hope is that the development of classic and the practices that went into making it carry on to the live game. That the next expansion takes what they learned from classic instead of BFA. 
---
Someone told me one time that no one working on BFA was working on wow when vanilla was out. I didnt bother to fact check that but it sounds nearly true.
---
Hi, /u/NtflxnChill
---
I've still got this sitting in my bags on my hunter and I use it for long travels/farming mats. People sometimes ask me where I got it. Hoo boy.
---
after reading several hundred variants of this joke in the past week, please, stop it
---
As long as you get the Black Qiraji mount, you'll be able to eventually complete everyting ;)
---
Tauren. Oh wait Shatner was tauren. Umm troll. Something tall.
---
Hrm... not sure which to trust then.  I would probably lean towards trusting the server select screen since it seems to be a lot more stable than the server itself right now.  But who knows.
---
Either way, a level 5 character is only 45-60 minutes depending on spawns and luck.
---
likely downvoted because you posted your frustrations in a thread where it isn't relevant. This is a thread for people who are having issues logging in and other stress test related posts, to prevent spam of topics of "omg im stuck at log in scREEEEn". People are using downvote on you for the reason downvoting was implemented.
---
they better add some sort of detriment to switching layers otherwise it will be exploited like crazy and you will fall behind if you don't also do it
---
I'm sorry but you're just making assumptions and wrong statements right now. I'm in a top 500 world guild and yes my alt has not been used for mythic progression cause it wasn't required, it hasn't done more than 3/9 (my main has 9/9 ofc).
---
Retail has had no real grind for years. Grinding AV rep is more work than this and that's not the biggest grind you even have in vanilla. Furthermore lvl 38 Neck was enough before BFA launch to get to pick your most important role azerite powers on 415 gear. I haven't done an island expedition since 8.1.5 and before that I didn't do more than the weekly required reaching lvl 40 before BFA launch and being 50 for about a month and a half (on my main). If I did that minimum on my alt it would've been fine aswell.
---
People like to believe that Mythic raiding requires a lot of time grind and effort but it really doesn't (above top 100 or so atleast). I won't argue that skill is more important however that's true. Saying that BFA has more grind than vanilla had is some serious bullshit though.
---
It’s best for pvp and normally pve focsed people don’t choose it, but there’s a ton of difficult bosses where escape artist is extremely useful. C’thun and Kel’thuzad to name a couple. 
---
Human weapon skill is good but it can be frustrating because it ruins every other weapon for you. You can get something sick af but you will feel like shit because it’s an axe or a dagger or something.
---
Unpopular opinion: They'll do progression servers up through MoP, which is when they added the in game store.
---
Actually my real guess would be a TBC server, most likely. Beyond that, who knows. It depends on if they see enough people returning to the game.
---
Think more Europeans trying this time due to it being 2 hours earlier, myself included.
---
Guys, they've acknowledged this bug several times now via blue post and are working on fixing it. Posting about it every day won't make the work go any faster.
---
You are off by a lot on these numbers. 
---
Vanilla = 9k  
---
BC=20k  
---
WotLK = 70k  
---
WoD=900k  
---
Legion=13-15mil  
---
Also power creep implies that other factors of the game stay the same, they increase mob hp and damage proportionally to player health/dps every expansion. There is no power creep, otherwise with "a 2000% increase" bosses would be dying in under 10 seconds. 
---
Closest we got to that was wod legendary ring.
---
i'd like to be able to stress the actual game server instead of the login screen. This doesn't bode well for august.
---
It's such a tough problem to solve, I think this sub needs to have a good discussion about the future of classic once it's been out for a while and people are done with the content. 
---
On one hand, having progressing expansions gives you a reason to play the new content. You want to get the more powerful gear than you have and finish the expansion with your sick new drops. But then you run into the same issue that you described that is the bane of retail, so it's not a long term solution. I played back in TBC days mainly and have tried going back now but the leveling experience is so dull until you're max level.
---
I like the "seasonal" solution you've proposed but then the gear you acquire from the rotating content can't really be progression based. If you missed a season you have to be able to participate in the next season. But then what's the point of acquiring gear from the previous season if it doesn't apply to the next season anyways. I don't know if getting gear for the sake of aesthetics would keep people engaged for that long but I guess if you look at skin sales in f2p games, maybe it could be!
---
maybe you're reading too many comments?
---
Weren't you the one saying earlier that you were in a retarded guild that didn't heal melee or some stupid shit?  Are those the guilds you are referring to when you say some guilds don't link meters?
---
You're a product of those retarded guilds and it shows.
---
I agree, but we need to make more noise about using the old combat text as the new combat text is subtle and horrid relative to the old combat text!
---
Not sure if you meant 1. Or 25., but reddit formatting always starts a new list with 1. No matter what number you write, try \\25. To get rid of formatting
---
all content creators are bad but asmongoloid is the worst one
---
I could show you a quote that indicates sharding was only going to be in starting zones and that's no longer the case.
---
So did I. Went back to EQ a couple of times, city of heroes (rip), marvel heroes (rip), wildstar (rip), SWTOR, even tried the dumpster fire of Skyrim: Multiplayer Mod Edition, better known as The Elder Scrolls Online. 
---
The rise of free to play models (that were all invariably pay to win), meant that flagship mmos didn't just have to compete with thousands of small competitors, but also felt pressured to fill up on microtransactions themselves.
---
When WoW rose to prominence, EQ had something like 80% of the MMO marketshare, with the rest spread around a mere handful of titles.  WoW had a very concentrated and focused market on which to set its sites.  It recruited prominent EQ players and listened to the feedback that Sony refused to listen to, and in a stroke decimated a game that, at the time, enjoyed unparalleled popularity.
---
In the years that passed, "WoW killers" came and went.  Many flamed out when they failed to immediately capture an appreciable fraction of WoW's playerbase, such as WAR or Tabula Rasa, others were forced to scale back massively or invest heavily in cash shops to stay alive, like Star Wars: The Old Republic or Black Desert.   
---
For years now, however, the market has been saturated.  As wow's numbers have fallen \~80% since their height, those players haven't disappeared.  They've just moved on to other games.  A potential "WoW Killer" now doesn't just need to target a single competitor, because WoW's market share has dropped precipitously.  WoW today has roughly the subscriber numbers as EQ did in 2004 (As can best be extrapolated, since they stopped releasing numbers when they started dropping after Wrath.  There was a thread on the official forums that credibly estimated the population at something like 1.75-2.25 million, with an approximately equal number in the WoW-Lite that china plays)  However, unlike EQ, though wow controls a plurality of the market, it does not control the majority.
---
World of Warcraft today is a lot like the British Empire.  It's still the biggest empire, but conquering it would not give you control of the world the way it would have in Victorian times.
---
Don't think they learned much from last week.
---
I was of the impression that the exact same number of players would be able to enter this time. Which makes the current situation really scary in my eyes - they knew the amount of ressources that were needed this time, and we still got the same situation as last week. They *won't* be able to tell the amount of ressources needed at the actual launch, especially since Ion stated that they will try to use as few servers as possible. If anything, this hints to launch day being a shitfest in a capacity we haven't even seen yet. But let's hope for the best shall we
---
&gt; The actual game servers need to be stressed as well.
---
There are more tests for that
---
You mean the .exe files? Haven’t had any luck with those unfortunately, and I’ve also reset my password to no avail. Thank you for your help though. Dark Lady watch over you.
---
I need arguments help me. 
---
Omg I actually lol'd. 
---
Playing 5 hours a week is perfectly fine.
---
She probably watches more than an hour of TV a day or the best option you have is getting her addicted to classic wow.
---
Bears were fantastic OTs. They had a ton of health, had taunt, good AoE threat. Plus when not tanking, they can go into cat form to help with DPS if needed or help off heal a little bit.  
---
There will be a lot of priests, put it that way. Not as many will be druids. The healing is completely different than it is now. Generally Healing Touch will be used more than Regrowth/Rejuv. Tranq is a very nice ability as well. Plus like you mentioned, innervate and brez are much needed.
---
There's a weekly thread for posts like these. Keep them in there.
---
Memory is a fickle thing... it was in the game from the beginning, Wowhead Classic has [comments](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11122/carrot-on-a-stick#comments) about it from December 2004 and January 2005 (probably originally from Thottbot, as Wowhead wasn't a thing until 2006). I most certainly had it and I quit the game before 1.9.
---
Yes. If you still have the collectors edition on your account I believe you get the pet at least.
---
Thanks for the analysis. yeah i would be picking troll purely for aesthetic reasons. How does tauren compare to orc?
---
Lol what? Getting through that part is part of testing the server.
---
Could a Prot/Holy Pala be a good enough healer to be relevant in a raid? I guess they probably could if they were geared correctly...?
---
True about the health bar management, thats certainly an aspect of healing that makes it fun for me too.
---
I reckon I'll copy you for sure with the Pala dream, and probably run a Warlock as an alt - only class I've never managed to max at any point! O_O
---
Relax we're getting another stress soon to see.
---
we are excited that it isn't working great because we feel the buzz of a community that's hyped for this, a big buzz is amazing for the gamer community who believes in blizzard to bring us together and the more the stress tests fail the happier I will be that there is enthusiasm and they get the chance to keep improving it till we see a and open stress primetime kind of event that is working, but still has some hiccups, loot lag, very occasional disconnect but not impossible queues are endless login failures
---
When Classic is out, Im gonna name my guild „Started from the stresstest now we here“
---
Getting stuck on Logging into game server for about 5 min then it loads me into the character select screen which is completely dark. It allowed me to try and make a character but wouldn't let me click accept. When I try and click Enter World it says the server isn't available yet :(
---
D3 could have been great with a true structured PvP system.. almost a decade later and I'm still salty all we got was brawling.

Is that a bug in the beta?  If so they'll probly fix it.
---
&gt;It was really the first mmo to allow players to participate in significant, meaningful world pvp
---
WTF! HAVE YOU NOT PLAYED THEIR PREVIOUS MASTERPIECE DARK AGE OF CAM-
---
&gt;after relatively little time invested compared to other mmos
---
Oh
---
Are you serious? You are being down-voted because you are convinced a corporate entity "hates" you. You are just being a drama queen.
---
Yes. If you owned the Collector's Edition pets in Retail, you'll own them in Classic. This is the only crossover between Retail and Classic Blizzard has announced.
---
wow that was freaking awesome!!!! level ONE to level FIVE? can someone get this guy a monster or a five hour energy?
---
FAKE qt haha thats so cute :3
---
No you see the difference is they're actually fixing some bugs in this one. Like hunter autoshot not working properly with quivers/ammo bags. It was the #1 topic of conversation in the beta world chat for awhile.
---
Without external help the clues are so fucking vague aswell lol. It’s like ”Yeah I heard it’s somewhere in the ocean good luck”.
---
If you are honestly in a relationship where you need permission to play a game, you gotta bigger problems than trying to get 4 hours a week to play. No one here has the expert knowledge to help you in that regard. I'm sure some people will hate on that answer, but I am married with a daughter as well, and I don't ask for permission to do anything. Just like she doesn't ask for permission to do her hobbies. 
---
Also the "video games are an addiction for stupid people" is an alarming snobby comment, and shows a lack of respect/love for you and your interests. Sorry bud
---
But you still have more power if you did those things. The power level jump for expansions means everyone starts off the expansion quite close to you, as long as they are near max level.
---
But a new WoW would have to tackle the same progression issues as Classic does if it becomes popular enough. Sure at the start everyone is enjoying leveling to max and experiencing the content but as soon as expansion content rolls around you have to find a way to please new players and max level players. This runs into the issue that /u/w_v is describing.
---
Is it also not true that you wont be dealing as much with rogues as compared to other casters as they tend to go for clothies? (in instanced pvp atleast)
---
I mean slap a 2h or 2 decent 1h and you’ll kill some shit.
---
Awesome! I’ve read that bear OTs are also nice since they don’t compete for gear with warriors, and can tank dungeons.    
---
Really leaning toward bear tbh
---
To be fair, they only have one server available for the stress test, not multiple which launch would have.
---
Well companies (looking at you Rockstar on RDR2O) keep calling things betas that clearly aren't betas. It's easy to get confused
---
If you look at primary stats on bfa, they're basically obsolete. Look at the item level of an item and you know how much stam and primary you have. It's boring AF. Ability power may as well directly scale with item level. They clearly didn't move in the right direction.
---
Primary stats in vanilla are way more interesting than on live, and they have the added bonus  of actually providing good flavor - what does crit rating even mean when you contrast that with agility or strength?
---
Dodge is already baked into agi in vanilla. And ya, parry could have been baked into strength.
---
Not that any of this matters but here are just some of my thoughts on what I don't like about secondary stats in vanilla itemization:
---
What does crit offer that agility and intellect don't? Crit chance just a more overpowered stat from a dps perspective, and just leads to more power creep.
---
It also undermines hyrbids like like pallies that have to draw from more sources. Items with all 5 stats have more budget, but primary stats are overshadowed by the really strong secondaries. Hybrids just get left behind with this kind of itemization.
---
There are talents/racials that use a percentage of primary stats too: divine strength, divine intellect, heart of the wild, lightning reflexes, spirit tap, spiritual guidance, blessing of kings, any mana regen while casting talents, the human spirit, expansive mind etc. These are all undermined by secondary stats that bypass primary stats.
---
Obviously gear would be boring if it was all just some combination of the 5 primary stats, but secondary bonuses should be things that bend the rules in more focused ways where they can be strong while still being replaceable. Things like "1% hit while using 2handed swords" "1% crit to instant cast spells".
---
This is the biggest reason i'd love to see a polished classic+.
---
Hm I have a Radeon 4870 from 2009 and I run vanilla smooth as hell at 60 FPS (maybe a bit less in raids, but still perfectly fine)...
---
10 to 1 they aren't.
---
They're going to duct tape over the cracks and hope it holds together until phase2.
---
How is he an idiot? That is all everyone ever says. Noone has a reason. It's some crazy circle jerk
---
That's pretty fucking clearly not how it's supposed to work and should be reported as a bug.
---
TBC Druid is how it should've been in Vanilla. The biggest flaw of Druids in Vanilla, in my opinion, is that all 3 specs play the same in PvP. All you do is soak damage in bear form, rotate stuns/roots and heals. While slowly killing the target with Moonfire, IS and Thorns. That's how it goes usually in all 3 specs.
---
TBC druid was a whole different kind of druid and it actually made Feral druids stay in cat form for longer, and Balance druids in moonkin form. You actually played how most people would think it would play out, when you went Feral or Balance. But it still didn't kill the whole shifting in and out of forms, rotating heals and what not. I guess they just toned down the whole Bear Form tanking with HotS, and made Moonkin/Cat form viable, to the point where it was worth it, to stay in them.
---
Mangle was all Druids needed. It made RIP and Rake go from being subpar to being worth it, and still could play on the whole dotting people up and tanking them in bear form, rotating heals and stuns, while they ticked.
---
Mangle also served as the ability feral druids needed, to do decent damage on demand, without having the requirement of being behind the target. Claw was absolutely terrible and did little to no damage. 
---
This is coming from a Druid main in Vanilla: TBC Druid really was fun and, in my opinion, show how it should've been in Vanilla, with Feral druids actually using Cat form much more and Balance druids getting casts off and staying in Moonkin form.
---
Niche specs? Give us armor for the *regular* specs. We don't have any Paladin dps sets, Druid tanking sets, etc.
---
The racial for Troll can be tricky to use well in PVP. But they definitely aren't as good in PVP as the others. Played Tauren Shaman in Vanilla and the Stomp is really useful, PvE and PvP.
---
Outside of my jest....
---
Do the dishes everyday you get home from work. 
---
Take a break at bed time, brush the kids teeth, and put them to bed. 
---
If you are going to game, you need to invest, but more importantly, make it noticeable that you are going the extra mile, in terms of her attention, and affection. 
---
If you plan on raiding, get a schedule and let her know you are hanging out with some old friends, tuesday, and Thursday nights, but make sure monday, wed, friday are her nights. 
---
Woman understand, especially when you tell them, 'babe, I know it is immature, but I want to experience some nostalgia for awhile'. 
---
Again, you should be fine as long as your irl tasks are being completed.
---
Not to mention all the items they changed when each xpac comes out  e.g. "this item has a chance to fail on targets over lvl 60". It was a conscious design decision by Blizz to just negate previous content instead of carrying it forward or keeping it relevant. It makes sense business-wise because they want people to play the new stuff, but it's horrible for the long term health of the game, and led to the situation the game is in right now.
---
Looks like it's not, so Blizzard learned in that regard, lol.
---
blizz admins are master baiters
---
Start a blog or complain on twitter Op
---
Didn't have it on on this account thanks for reminding.
---
somethings off  
---
dmg calc from the wiki: normalized_damage = base_weapon_damage + (X * Attack Power / 14)  
---
using your 1000ap, normalized axe would be: 154 + (235) = 389  
---
sword would be: 124 + (235) = 359   
---
difference is sizeable  
---
and the mace for good measure: 146+235= 381  
---
if you are human, and leveling 2h fury(no axe spec) mace is the unquestionable best option. They should probably be leveling arms though.  
---
not that it matters here, at least i dont think, but generally when you want to calc these its best to use the avg dmg of the weap not just the max.
---

I recently did the questchain on a pserver, VERY fun and challenging! Demons despawninc for a couple of hours and competing for the kills with other hunters sure was tough. But damn was it satisfying, many a different virtue is needed to obtain Rhok’delar.
---
There's a Druid trainer in Stormwind. You'll also have Teleport: Moonglade. Just don't leave Darnassus until you've completed the level 10 class quest. IIRC, you'll want to go back at 16 to do both the Cure Poison and Aquatic Form quests.
---
I don't know what the hell this is, but it sounds like I could lvl 1 run into WPL, and there's just something fundamentally wrong with that.
---
I came as near as the world loading screen but it never finished..
---
stuck on 'Logging in to game server' with the occassional disconnect  :(
---
thats not even in the context of what me and the other fella were discussing but thanks for pointing that out, first class troglodyte you are.
---
You're literally missing the whole point
---
best way to do it is to run it on separate servers and offer a migration for those that want to do it, but keep the classic servers going as they are
---
D3 got great loot after RoS came out though. The bigger problem is that 99% of it isn't considered BiS for any semi-competitive builds. If they would have had more options for endgame other than GRifts, more builds (and thus more loot) would have been viable.
---
You literally set yourself up to get that comment.
---
Play how you want.. as long as you're playing alone or with friends
---
If playing with pugs remember strangers dont owe you anything, dont get mad when they kick you because you're 17 dps meme spec isnt working. You're wasting other peoples time and is not okay and shouldn't be encouraged

My point is that these communities are 1000x more cancerous and toxic than any content creator and are the ones that actually put the community in a bad light.

---
after wow classic and burning crusade i wasn't able to find a game that i can commit to... usually pick a new trending game play it for a few weeks then quit and try to find another game. there's no other game like wow classic for me! sadly i can't play as much as i was able to when i just younger but the good part is that i  will have money to play with a better pc! my pc was really bad... and i was barely able to pay the wow subscription if i saved the school money :D hope to see you guys soon in azeroth again!
---
Wow man. A fulfilling job. How does that feel
---
Look at it from the bright side: considering we're once again not able to log on for the first 2-3 hours just like last week, chances are they'll do another stress test next week :p
---
I don't think they ever said WoW was dead? Just saying it's become bloated and hard to approach from the beginning. If you're not playing the end game, you just steam roll everything to get there. Not fun for me.

That's true I suppose. Fair enough. I'll be waiting for his NELF videos then.
---
Not really the same at all IMO, that is for retail. For one, sharding/layering is a much bigger issue to classic players than it is to retail players and blizzard knows this. Especially years after it’s implementation and reaction to it.
---
I don't mind a login screen for 2 hours. The fact they leave the server up for 24 hours is enough of a compensation.
---
REEEEEEE LET ME INNN
---
What happens to all the dead servers in half a year? They get merged. No thanks, I'd rather have layering for a few weeks than have my dying server suddenly full of people I've never heard of for the remainder of the game. Happened to me once before and my guild fell apart because people joined new ones.

When I quest in bfa I can entirely trust the questing guides on the map to tell me where to go and with mouseover I can tell what to kill when I get to the location. It makes the entire experience very very brainless. It's the same thing in wrath on private servers, even though the content there is still a lot harder than bfa. 
---
Making the intuitive thing to do when faced with the game's interface actually reading the quests to figure out what to do feels so much more like an rpg. It doesn't feel like you're thinking when you're doing it with questie. It doesn't feel like you're in a real world. 
---
I do get that it's annoying, but I think the detriment to the feel of the game is actually huge.
---
I remember him selling white shirts for an obscene amount of money because it said "made by sandisk", and I definitely remember buying one
---
Def give it a try, plus seeing the high health as a bear was always great. Very easy, swipe, maul, challenging roar if needed. Plus the frenz. regen was nice. Only downside is that the rotation is going to be extremely boring.
---
you know its funny how retarded you are, for too many good reasons. for one, youre aruging against something that is so easy to pick up. im 25 and i played vanilla when i was 12, this guy is 1 year below me which means he was 11 back then. 9 doesnt make sense. like how stupid can you be. you keep downvoting me, you keep editing your negative iq posts, you keep replying to me to begin with, and youre reporting for some shit... people like you are the cancer of reddit. thats legit pure autism. i feel sorry for you and more for your son who has to grow up with a mentally challenging dad like you. i wonder in what age will he start claiming that hes adopted
---
preach
---
You can spell batch it. You can also Hammer of Justice them so you both end up stunned. Its silly, but very vanilla. (We just assumed back in that day it was lag.)

Sorcerer
---
I'm wondering how can you tell since it did not start yet.
---
It's apparently not and I'm SO very happy about this. Everybody doing their part.
---
I levelled my warrior as Arms, i just found prot to be so slow at levelling that it just wasn't worth the time investment compared to arms, and sins for dungeons all you needed was defensive stance and 1h&amp;shield i saw no advantage to being prot till 60
---
Not even close to reality.
---
My doing I'm part
---
Honestly man I recommend you just remove yourself from any notable WoW personality. Everything related to it is like the pettiest, middle school tier shit I've ever seen. Their "thoughts" videos is almost always just half an hour of them rambling with no structure or concise points.
---
Depends on the patch too. About the time they we're ramping up for the first expansion they broke priests and boomkin and pallys became the supreme healers. I was actually refused groups as a holy priest and had to respec shadow. When I started a couple months after launch priests were where it was at.
---
Can't log in to game server
---
&gt;My wife answer is that I'm not a responsible person, videogames are an addiction for stupid people  
---
Ask her why she married a stupid person in the first place.
---
maybe consider being original
---
As far as who gets a beta key. Yes, they are in fact better. They gave a key to Esfand a popular streamer. Now I have been enjoying watching him. As has my brother and 3 of his friends. If they gave you the key. Who are you? No one. I don't mean that as a slap. In the wow community I am no one too. It's just if they gave you a key. You generate zero hype. Because in the wow community your name means nothing. Again I'm no one too so I'm not trying to slap you. I'm just saying being successful in your field. Generates huge benefits for that person in that field. Thats just how life works.
---
&gt; They wouldnt have the T2 mog unless they had the gear
---
I used T2 paladin tmog even in full heroic Uldir gear. Why? WoW hasn't had decent armor designs since Wrath/Cata.
---
Even if you’re joking, get bent.
---
 like how would they even fix that? if they made it so phasing between  layers would bring any tagged mobs with you it would just open a bigger can of worms with potential exploits and griefing.
---
1 hour later, most streamers are still on the log-in screen from what I can see, Asmongold at the very 'least is just watching WoW videos while stuck on realm list.
---
Was able to login, but unable to move at all. Couldn’t pan my camera either. But there was some people moving around me. I was able to click on interface options like the map and bug report. I tried logging out and the timer ticked down then nothing happened. I was able to use the character stuck option and my character was teleported to the GY. Really weird so I just had to end task and now i’m in the same boat as everyone else :-)
---
I played my hunter as a melee class until around the barrens and thought that I was doing it right lmao
---
Yeah, we had good times, we still play each expansion. Typically the first month of each expac release, and then the last month before the next xpac. 
---
Our guild still has 200 people in it, but it is dead, the community in wow was lost over the years.
---
I am so excited for classic, she is too. 
---
Have your wife come play... maybe she will get a kick out of it.
---
They're testing layering in the beta...
---
Like, this is why they're testing it...
---
It’s just unneeded you can tank everything as arms or fury and kill stuff in the open world more effectively. With that said I’ll be farming ore and skinning as a fresh 60 prot warrior to try and save up for all the things a warrior needs to be better than average.
---
Why are people hating TipsOut again? I don't get it.. Havn't really seen any compelling evidence - and not at all the justify the witch hunt.
---
Maybe you should take part in the stress test, you seem a little stressed.
---
I agree, its our reward for doing it.
---
I got exactly this
---
Stress test isn't about what you like
---
Legion was amazing. I had so much fun. It brought the class quests and class identity from Vanilla, also the talent system (somewhat) through artifact traits. It had a lot of cool collectibles like class mounts and artifact skins. Legendary acquisition was annoying but their effects (mostly) were a fun bonus. I loved the Holy Priest Cloak.
---
The dungeons were incredible. I had so much fun in M+ during Legion. They were brimming with lore, all of them. The combo of artifacts, legendaries and tier sets made classes so fun to play, and M+ was an especially fun way to spend time. I really miss Legion so much, even tho I'm looking forward to Classic release.
---
this is my worry, i dont want this to be a "classic" server that start out as a good server and then people go "what harm would transmog do, or i want pet battles" and then you get he "leveling is too slow" people and then it just turns in to BFA but only 1-60 content, that's a bit of an over exaggeration but the fact remains when you start to change too much you will lose the feel of the original server that people wanted.
---
don't get me wrong i am fairly in the #nochange camp, but i understand some of the changes they have made, who wants to have to hold shift every time you loot something when they can just add in the auto loot option that come out in 2.1? it doesn't change the game it doesn't make the overall game easier it just makes it so you're not getting angry that you have to hold shift every time you loot, and hell if you really dont think it should be there then don't turn it on but also don't cry when you miss a quest item because you forgot to press shift when looting
---
so some QoL changes are for the better and things that should have been added in long before they were. I've not seen the full list of what changes have been made but what i saw on the first stress test i was on there didn't seem to be too many
---
how would they even fix that? if they made it so phasing between  layers would bring any tagged mobs with you it would just open a bigger  can of worms with potential exploits and griefing.  they need to just remove it and spin up enough servers for the launch to happen then merge later.
---
Yeah the actual best PvPers on my server back in the day were never high ranked very high but if you saw them play it was obvious how good they actually were.
---
Yet the ones that did get the high ranks talked like they were gods when they actually weren't that good.
---
Apparently it is a problem that has existed in retail wow for 3 years, and is now present in classic since it shares so much of the same code.
---

I'm not holding my breath
---
Telling time is difficult for you huh
---
How about &lt;Logging in to game server&gt;
---
Let me in...... ;)
---
Unless I am high, 2pm pst was like an hour ago
---
There is. Ion said if there's a massive server pop on a single server they will add realms and discuss transfers.
---
Elective realm transfers have always been a thing in WoW. This is nothing new and won't be new in Classic.
---
I really want to save that baby in the end.
---
"Clowns with min-max'd specs and gears clicking their spells and keyboard turning will never be as good as a dual spec player that actually knows how to play."
---
Your entire argument is based on this false dichotomy. You're not wrong with this statement, but the statement itself is dishonest.
---
If someone cares enough to minmax and ensure they have the proper spec for raiding they are by default going to care more and try harder than an equally random someone who does not care about minmaxing and does not have the proper spec. 
---
Whether minmaxing and a proper spec should be required is debatable, but you're certainly not clearing BWL anytime soon with a raid full of Moonkins and Shadow Priests, so at least a few people are carrying you if you're showing up unprepared.
---
Yes, guys, we fucking know that the actual game servers need to be stressed as well. I don't get why people feel the need to point that out over and over again.
---
GG! I gave it an honest try (both stress tests). Giving up now. Good luck to those who remain brave enough to slam through it. I'll check it out tomorrow for a bit.
---
I remember being so excited when I finally got my first pair of shoulders. I finally looked badass in my eyes. Although I'm pretty sure I was like level 18 lol
---
People be like it's only 3%. Then as they ignore that and the HW grinder slowly gains on that ass... You like I NEED THAT 3%!!
---
Search up tequila city of heroes. Should be somewhere don't have a link on hand cause I'm at work
---
Where do you have this information from?
---
Thank you for the positive energy! See you on Classic.
---
Can you blame them when you see a clip like this? This shit never happened in vanilla, like what does it even exist in classic now?
---
Don't listen to noobs who spew the dot-shield-wand meme. You want to add as many Mind Blasts, Mind Flays and other appropriate nukes as your regen allows. Spend mana and let your regen do work. There's no point in taking Spirit Tap if you *finish* the fight at 95% mana.
---
I think the point is that we can't trust Blizz about these kinds of things anymore.
---
Like blizz has changed significantly. The things they say are not assured whatsoever.
---
a whole week!..
---
Did you know that this is only a test to determine how much stress the players are willing to tolerate before they log off and never touch the game again?
---
DM blues DE to large Brilliant shards and arcane dust. You can do 3 runs an hour, so can easily get upwards of 100-150g an hour depending on your server economy.
---
Ya I mean, I like the idea of being able to heal as I level when needed and tank in dungeons at 60. 
---
I like the idea of being under represented, easier to get gear.  I've raid healed before as a priest so hopefully can figure out how to do it as a druid.
---
yeah, I see what you mean. the attraction of new content will always make the old stuff obsolete to an extent. i might be trying to solve a paradox.
---
Honestly I think locks pretty much hard counter frost mages in a 1v1. Mages are counters to rogue and warrior in vanilla. Hunters and locks tend to beat mages.
---
Modern IT can horizontally scale by spinning up more containers to run the code. They probably limit the instances to see what issues come up. On launch I hope(tm) it’s a non issue
---
Don’t forget how useful will of the forsaken really is, too.
---
i woke up in Orgrimmar alone, go outside, killed a boar and then ......        server is down. ..... #letmeinagainplz :P
---
P.S.: I'm going for TestServer First: Level 10
---
Yeah but I'm also thinking.. My wife's goin tauren shaman. We'd  be together pretty often. I doubt other warriors will have windfury totem and heals. Come to think of it every time I've seen tauren warriors rip it up in vanilla it seemed to be they were popular and could have druids or shaman behind them half the time. I'd rarely see a tauren with the lone wolf I'll 1v3 you mentality that others have.
---
Bit extreme
---
i dunno why people think gaming is inherently bad, its a hobby just like everything else is. and its not hurting anyone so why is she being so rude about it? partners should support each others hobbies and interests, even if they don't understand or participate in them themselves.
---
playing an hour or two everyday is not that much time, mot people spend more time binge watching netflix, watching tv or aimlessly browsing the internet each day. gaming is not going to seriously negatively impact anything as long as you don't skip out on irl events (kids bday parties, important get togethers, work events etc). so there is no reason for you not to play. if her only reason to complain about you playing classic is that gamers are addicted and stupid she really needs a reality check.
---
edit: and for the record, my husband and i were irl acquaintances during vanilla and started playing together. we got super close adventuring our way across azeroth over the many years we've been playing this game together. we're happily married and will be playing classic together.
---
Had a guy in the guild test a theory. He tried to log on got denied. Started streaming. 4 of us went to his stream. He was able to log on after that.
---
That's not really the point though. It works both ways.
---
&gt;somethings off  
---
&gt;dmg calc from the wiki: normalized\_damage = base\_weapon\_damage + (X \* Attack Power / 14)
---
Yeah you're correct I did the dividing outside the parenthesis like an idiot.  
---
&gt; mace is the unquestionable best option.  
---
For human PvE levelling sword is still a questionably best option given these numbers. Edgemaster Hanguards are considered BiS for a reason after all. The question is how much damage does the +5 skill actually give on average.
---
It is a separate installation. Less than 8GB.
---
Doing anything that progresses your character in exchange for out-of-game currency should be bannable. From the perspective of the buyer, they can just buy retail WoW tokens to make the gold to pay for it if they don't have enough. So it's basically to pay to win. 
---
Normally you would have to complete the dungeon yourself, which might be slow if you're bad, and you might get kicked if you suck badly enough.
---
latest blue post about beta
---
Yeah but no World PvP. . which i miss
---
I think Gw2 is the ultimate casual MMORPG and I still play it and fully intend to continue even after Aug 27th, it's such a different beast from Classic WoW. Retail WoW is the worst of both games, imo
---
:( but i wanna play too
---
What I really wanted from this one was a sign of improvement, but yeah, I'll bug their login servers for two hours if it gives me the ability to play a bit later.
---
I'm no changes, but Warriors, Rogues, Mages, Hunters and Warlocks ALL NEED TO BE NERFED!!! But please don't touch any of *my* favorite classes.
---
Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
---
I see you /u/Teeb
---
If this happens to me during classic I'm probably going to quit.
---
Global sharding, oh I'm sorry, "layering" is unacceptable.
---
Very well said!
---
terrible apathetic post
---
Okay, but then they still had exact control over how many people are able to login at once. People who could previously login + the new wave. Considering the amount of skill and knowledge blizzard technicians should have at this point, this scenario should've been way more successful, but for some reason we're not seeing any of that and I'm honestly wondering why that is
---
&gt;No, people said that they were wrong, not necessarily easy. Didn't really matter though since toxic private server players were ready to go for your throat for even suggesting that private server weren't 100% accurate.
---
Bro, have you ever been on a private server? Literally no reasonable person thinks private servers are 100% accurate. They just relentlessly argue that x server is more accurate than y server. The largest 1.12.1 server has crabs in the Barrens called Silithid Harvesters for fuck sake.
---
In my experience it's roughly 1/3
---
The more, the merrier!
---
around early april
---
community outrage got us classic in the first place though. now you want people to be docile and pretend things are ok. no?
---
That's more than fair.
---
I personally find there's more than a fair few of quests (or at least, as I remember them) that were just aggravating to do without looking up the coordinates of an item in some way. Just a lot of fumbling around and searching and 'It says go in this direction and look around here *so what the fuck am I missing?!*'
---
Nothing happens to dead servers. If your server is dead and it bothers you, create a new character on a different realm.
---
You have to divorce your wife and abandon your children. It's the only reasonable solution.
---
Ye, but - so is sitbatching a bug or a clever use of game mechanics? Will it be possible on live? Not-a-bug list is ambiguous.
---
Almost all his videos are misleading, his acts as if he has experience where he doesn't.
---
He's currently in the making of a mage "deep dive" from a guy who plays warlock. Not mage, warlock.
---
Oh yes, they *totally* aren't going to invite more people to the stress test than the server can realistically handle, with a good margin since they can't ensure that everyone who receives an invite will actually try it.
---
Your argument means nothing as well, you have no numbers to say whichever is more right. But yes, hopefully they manage to figure something out, otherwise we'll have the 24 hours after thankfully to play around a bit with.
---
It was a joke by the gms... people are taking this too seriously. Next msg was saying it was a joke...
---
Not the person you replied to but Orc is better for enhancement where as it's a toss up for elemental. As many people have said, resisting a HOJ, cheap shot, kidney shot, or potentially even intercept stun could be the difference in winning or losing a fight, but it's important to remember that it's not guaranteed that you'll resist a stun and not every class has notable stuns.
---
The reason I mention Tauren for elemental specifically is because War Stomp buys you enough time to cast a chain lightning. Of course the extra health is a nice benefit as well.
---
That said, you are correct in your assessment that Trolls are the coolest race.
---
I don't care what the community hates I'm stating my own opinion.
---
&gt;layering will be in ***until*** phase two opens up the world bosses.
---
Blizzard's specific wording was a few weeks, or *until* that point at the latest.
---
Because MP4's are significantly better.
---
And innervate
---
Tips is not a positive contributor at all lol
---
So I've decided to finally be a healer, first time in my wow career.   I'm very interested in druid but really want to say and ask a few things first. 
---
I didn't play classic, if I roll resto druid theoretically would I gear up faster ( in a perfect world of loot drops) since resto druid is an uncommon class.  Or does resto druid share drops with everyone else that they're after?  
---
I'm not sure I want an alt yet, not even a mage or Hunter for farming.  What are my options for farming mobs and dungeons as resto for gold?  Is it viable?  
---
What is playing hpally like?  Is the rebuffing really that obnixious?   Is hpally a satisfying class you think?   I read she can sleep farm real easy.  
---
Lastly, if I wanted to tryhard meters to style on my friends, which healing class should I consider?
---
Don't you mean. Amalarah Alan, I know you main a blood elf.
---
The servers will be up for another 24 hours after the 2 hour stress test period.
---
I know it is, but thats exactly why nobody plays it anymore and it blows. I really, really wanted D3 to be a good game.
---
Same, it broke my immersion so hard it made me value non-wow things much higher.
---
Vanilla footage:
---
1) Sprint allows him this auto combined with X + Y Axis. Watch the clip further you will see a SMALLER range occur. 
---
TBC Footage 
---
1) Watch him STOP; then jump strafe away while the other person is still moving towards him this is a far away attack but a great clip displaying what happens with some additional latency--no where near the perplexity range. 
---
2)Notice him moving backwards and then slightly strafing left to allow the proper range. If you compare this range and range you see in Perplexity's clip they are massively different. 
---
3 This shows proper range and nothing in comparison to what you see on beta. 
---
3.0.2 pre-patch footage:
---
1) Nothing interesting about this you see the rogue sprinting and his AA animation goes off later because of that
---
2) Again Z axis + sprint showing you a large range but not the LEEWAY range that you see on beta. 
---
"For example, Taurens have roughly 4.0 yard CombatReach, most other races have around 1.5 yards.
---
Tauren vs Tauren: 4.0 + 4.0 + 4/3 = 9.33 yards(12 if leeway)
---
Tauren vs Other race: 4.0 + 1.5 + 4/3 = 6.83 yards(9.49 if leeway)
---
Other race vs Other race: MAX(5, 1.5 + 1.5 + 4/3) = 5.0 yards(7.66 if leeway)"
---
​None of the clips you've posted show leeway; your equations are right for leeway if we were playing Cata,Mop, Wod, Legion, Bfa. 
---
This is vanilla.
---
but it raises attention to something that is so clearly broken.
---
Gimli has done so much to improve the public image of dwarves
---
No way Blizz would add a cooldown, its makes grouping with friends difficult. Layering should be removed or only be present in the very first starting areas.
---
Brave Sir Robin agrees.
---
Isnt tips a warrior
---
No you shouldn't.
---
I still remember what happened during and after the BFA beta so I'm sceptical of the whole we have it under control line.
---
say whaaaaaatt
---
&gt;I would absolutely go back to playing retail again if they went back to dynamic zone levels and ditched the scaling
---
And I wouldn't. But we can still be friends!
---
Incoming third stress test.
---
You running 10 fps or something?
---
This stress test wasn't even scheduled - the next one was supposed to be in mid June.  So whatever broke last week they're trying to fix now, and it's still broken.
---
A lot further than some of us
---
Old world before everyone was able to power level in Abyssea? You can do a Private server, some are closer to old than others, some are modded to hell I’ve heard.
---
I played on Nasomi, I believe was it it’s spelled. It had a two character limit, allowed dual boxing (openly), and has a few  QOL tools. 
---
I believe Nasomi goes up to Chains of Promathia. So no abyssea, dancer, scholar, and anything after that. It has some modded stuff though, there are browser tools that let you search everyone’s bazaars, and a few other things I forgot. But it’s much closer to old FFXI before stuff got a bit crazy. 
---
Although retail is still a great game, you just get to lvl 99, sub DNC and destroy most the early expansions. On retail I soloed vanilla, zilart, COP, Treasures OAU, and a good chunk of wings OTG.
---
You forgot the bigest meme: "You shouldn't roll a retard-alin. You can't dps, you can't tank and you can't heal. You should roll something else."
---
I cannot recommend Countdown enough. It really does scratch that itch for Classic news and information. Josh does a great job and really hits his stride in later episodes. I recently got caught up, and I must say I'm a bit bummed to have to wait a week for the next episode.
---
Retro-wow
---
The Dwarven tendency to just go around digging up everything probably doesn't help endear them to the Tauren. Bael Modan, anyone?
---
You can train your abilities in Stormwind, in the Park. Aside that, druid endgame is one of the most fun and most underdog experiences. People don't expect the power of a powershifting feral kitty druid =) Rdruid is also a very good healer, one of my favorites. Feral Bear is quite viable aswell. People think that they're trash specs, but they are not. Prove skeptical people wrong, it's a great feeling =)
---
Hi, /u/Bouncedmetal
---
Yea gouging a mages blink was also silly but a lot more harder to pull off
---
Exactly, although if my main was any indication getting the same level for a viable alt wouldn't have been much more difficult. My point being something like BG rep farm or AD farm in vanilla is something you would almost never repeat on an Alt.
---
Holy shit I got in
---
My first toon was a dwarf so going into Loch Modan after the snowy starter zone was a nice change of scenery. I remember being mesmerized by the two giant statues going into the zone from the south.
---
Did they remove the queueing system? Is that why I'm not seeing a queue count? Is that part of the "layering" changes?
---
Leveled my first druid on a pserver up to 20 and it was the funnest class ever
---
&gt; i dont understand the hate got prot leveling
---
Basically it's because Prot as a spec isn't at all necessary to tank dungeons up to level 60. You'll get a lot more mileage out of Arms or (2H) Fury while keeping a shield/1h weapon in your bags.
---
Stuck on “Logging in to game server”
---
Wand, shield and hot, rest of the spells are situational. Should easily be able to grind mobs same level or 1 to 2 above nonstop with no mana breaks.
---
Yes tipsout plays a warrior but he has a small series on his youtube which is class deep dives where he talks with a private server "expert" about each class. For the mage one despite there being lots of people who could do it well, he chose a guy who knows nothing about mages.
---
Idk, have you played the original recently? I rarely, if ever feel like im some demigod slaugthering tons of demons in Diablo. Its very slow paced and feels methodical and almost like a strategy game.
---
because the nochanges crowd has been drowned by the majority that plays retail or never played vanilla at all
---
its the same reason why no one cares about layering even though everyone cared about sharding, there are too many new players that are blizzard fanboys
---
That is the point, the exact point that the person I responded to made.  The reverse is being brought up elsewhere.
---
“logging in to game server”
---
That’s all I have seen for the last 20 minutes.
---
We are almost there boys and girls!
---
Ah, the old retaliation into thunderclap combo. It's a sure bet to beat a scary druid.
---
Nah its just that many ppl see this as a free demo and not a stress test. They cant login and play and thats why the stopped login in overall + many hang right before the server login.
---
&gt;What's rough is, they'll be drowned out eventually, but I fear that it'll be the retail crowd that takes over.
---
already has, post some objective mechanics and call someone else wrong and you will get downvoted
---
That suckkkkss
---
Honesetly man if it bothers you that much, just hide the threads. There will only be a couple "streamer" servers, and I plan on avoiding them entirely. Of course it sucks for the people that join them unwittingly but alas.
---
Also I wouldn't really say it's an issue with this sub in particular because the same shit crops up on any game that's popular on Twitch. That said, it's way worse on here because a lot of them aren't top tier competitors and they're also the vast majority of them are petty, incessant, whiny manbabies. As I said earlier, middle school tier personalities.
---
Unfortunately, reddit's upvote/downvote system amplifies bitching and "hot takes." Ideally, I'd like to see [more posts like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs6mxw/gather_around_vanilla_newbies_let_me_warn_you/), but general interest subs aren't really tailored for that
---
Any idea where I can find these blue posts? I'm looking on MMO champ blue tracker and only see posts about stress test or "not a bug" list. It's not even in their Known issues post.
---
I feel like my art emulates my mind. In other 2orrs you gotta be truly dumb to spend countless of hours making this shit 😅
---
You don't have any paladin dps specs, either :P
---
But yeah, I agree - they should work to make hybrids more viable
---
i agree with ditching lfr/lfg and all of the bs QOL things they did add, but i like the way flying has been implemented in the last few expansions with pathfinder, i would rather they did it the WOD way of pathfinder where we arent even allowed to start the final part of it until the very last raid tier, albeit that was 2 because WOD was trash but
---
and some of the awful parts are just opinions though, up until the last hardcore gutting that removed 50% of all classes abilities i feel like they did them pretty well, and mechanics in the game now are much better than the tank and spanks that existed in classic, which is going to be a huge problem that everyone that is going to play classic is going to be so much better then when or if they did play classic, the bosses will be trivial and everything is going to be cleared and farmed by the second week, the only that will hold prestige in classic is scarab lord because thats an actual set time, 6 months after phase 6 is released anyone that is still logging on everyday will see corrupted ashbringers everywhere, its not going to magically stay the difficulty we all thought it originally was.
---
Just go play on a vanilla private server lol the fuck you wanna be level 30 for 3 months for

Well yes. I am not disputing that Warriors can do a tremendous amount of threat but it's still below Druids at the very top end. While Warriors certainly scale well with damage, a sizable portion of their threat is still just flat while a Druid's threat comes from close to 100% of its damage.
---
Because of this a Druid gets a straight up 50% increase on their threat while using Pummelers. This can be increased further by trinkets such as Kiss of the Spider for another significant threat boost similar to a Warrior using Death Wish.
---
You can read the document below for threat comparisons between the two classes. Also keep in mind that with /sitting for Enrage being less reliable in Classic we can expect Warrior threat to decrease somewhat while a Druid's threat will remain largely unaffected.

It's in their list of acknowledged bugs
---
The layer exploiting is getting wildly exaggerated. It’s not really profitable outside of the first couple weeks for people who have jumped ahead of the pack leveling. Once everyone catches up you end up with the same number of people competing over the same amount of resources as you would on a normal server. 
---
5 layers? 5x the farmers competing over 5x the resources. The exploits assume you will be able to simply hop to a pristine layer where nothing has been farmed. That’s not going to be the case. Every layer will be populated.
---
do you feel validated by using other peoples content
---
It's effectively a bug report. His tone is irrelevant. 
---
Why should you care if he shits on Blizzard? Nothing they have done recently has exactly been worthy of white knighting. They've gone far, far downhill.
---
I know this is a stress test. I have zero expectation to play in the first two hours. This is a legitimate question; not a rant.
---
Why do you watch his stuff if you hate him?
---
friend this is just what I could find in 2 minutes of googling with reasonable proof. Hes done other crap, but this alone makes a point. I'm not here to tell you what to do, but I will help educate why hes a shitlord. There are way better streamers who don't suck ass like Bajeera, TradeChat and PatKrane that I give my attention to.
---
Yep, so don't worry OP.
---
There are two more tests. This test is for testing, also.
---
This sub was always about classic. Players help each other with game mechanics, equipment, tactics and other random questions. I've never really seen a casual player get shooed away. You, on the other hand, are toxic and posting spam.
---
This is the main reason I can't play a night elf. I spend far too long trying to beat my records.
---
They've already acknowledged it though.  How many times do we honestly need them to say "we know, we're working on it"?
---
I managed to get into the character editor once, but kept getting "Error Creating Character".  Then I started to see my character list from the first stress test.  Now I'm "Logging in to game server" again.
---
I'm assuming they're getting some decent info from all the login attempts, so it's all good.

I'm discouraged from playing lots of classes because of certain aspects of the game, relative to other classes, that aren't ideal to me.  My solution is to play the class that I am most encouraged to play.  This isn't a transmog issue.  Crazy thought, you can wear whatever cloth/leather/mail gear you want.  Nobody said you have to do top damage in order to play 95% of the game.
---
Just got in iam in the intro right now.. all seems fine.
---
I mained a mage. I used to get so freaking mad when that happened. or like when I nailed em with rank 1 AE, and still got ambushed
---
In Orgrimar you have to shit in a hole in the ground and wipe your ass with leaves.
---
Are there any lists anywhere of attack speeds for potential pets? It'd be nice to find a high APS wolf, for the party damage boost howl.
---
ridiculous scaling and cross realms are why i quit years ago
---
there's not even a queue count anymore. interesting.
---
Trust me. For its time, Everquest was the goooood shit. If they made a game with that kind of game play with todays graphics etc. they'd have a happy fan base out there. People are pretty sick of the mobile game loot crate stuff.
---
Always go aesthetics over racials. While racials do matter ..unless you are super try-harding PvP I wouldnt chose that over aesthetics. There arent gonna be many times where you get outplayed and a racial was the one thing that could save you. Not saying they cant be clutch especially like wotf for a rogue but Its usually skill/gear/engineering/pots that wins in PvP. On the flip side you are staring at your character the entire time with no way to change it outside of re-rolling so I personally wouldn't suggest playing something you hate to look at for such a minor advantage for 1 aspect of the game.
---
And i was just answering your question?
---
until it actually gets fixed would be rational, i'd say.
---
He specifically said if you are 2h fury, go mace. So idk why you talking about sword spec. 
---
Edgies are BiS against lvl 63 bosses because the boss exceeds your level and you can glance on it. Warrior leveling is typically against monsters below your level.
---
The damage difference is sizable. I dont think sword is ever the right choice.
---
It's okay to be sceptical, but at the moment we're being the equivalent of a child asking their parent for something repeatedly, hoping we get a different answer.
---
We got our answer, and it was the one we wanted. So there's literally no reason to keep asking.
---
While I agree with this sentiment for a lot of games, Blizzard actually has pretty solid betas in regards to fixing bugs (re-evaluating game design flaws is a bit more of a tossup).
---
This isn't some generic AAA marketing beta that happens two weeks before release when everyone on the team is just bracing themselves to be prepared for launch.
---
I saw a queue a few times, between 3 and 80.
---
But yeah, i'm still waiting for the client to log me to the game server.
---
Didnt you just contradict yourself? You say the loot got great, but 99% of it is useless. I mean sure you see a ton of orange lights, but is that really more interesting? I honestly feel like loot got worse in RoS. Yes, more legendaries got interesting effects, but they made rare items 100% obsolete endgame, and every bis list is exactly the same items. I think set items being so strong is a mistake, as it basically makes loot redundant. Might aswell just build those effects into the class at that point.
---
LOL no, having a problem with "look at me culture" does not make me a bad guy. You need to reassess your automatic embrace of this new technology and contemplate its impact on the society while you sit there drooling watching a person playing video games that you could easily play yourself.....
---
You  mean static zone levels? Dynamic means they change, which is what scaling is. Didn't even know that was a thing though. If you go back to a level 10 zone at level 110, everything is scaled up to 110?
---
Yep. me too. At least it'll make launch day smooth (in theory)!
---
Stormwind has a library, orcs can't even read LULW

Why not wait until August to buy time then?

i'm going to camp people leveling until they log off
---
that's how i'd like to play
---
Still logging in to game server. Glad some people can get in lol
---
This need not apply to you sir. Please continue your crusade. We all support you.
---
I played Holy Pally / Destro Lock in TBC and it was amazing. Planning to do the same in Classic!
---
This is the reason i stopped playing WoW in the first place and have never been back or interested until the release date on classic came out.
---
Looking forward to playing again with a version of the game that was good (and silently hoping they progress it into TBC, that was my favourite expac)
---
You're going to annoy people either way, but a forced upgrade to TBC and making people start again somewhere else (if they just want to stay in Vanilla) seems like a sure fire way to piss off the most people.    
---
New fresh TBC realms, some with character copy up and some without seems by far the smartest solution.
---
How did you get in? Did you just sit at “Logging in to game server”

---
I kinda liked the dynamic scaling... in retail.  While i dont think it has a place in classic, i did like being able to kinda pick my own way through leveling in a game that had near 15 years worth of content.  If you had to do all of it to get to the end no one would have capped, and the leveling speed required just didnt fit into the old zones well.  So the scaling was a good addition there imo.
---
But how do you represent this to the player?
---
Same here. Character screen was available (but buggy) and it said I had no characters and had to create a new one. Got kicked off the game like a minute later again though. So yeah, hopefully just a bug and that I can continue on my lvl 5 once the stress test server works "normal" again.
---
I would be for them implementing expansions only if they were on their own separate server. I remember reading that if they do it, that’s the way it’ll be done. That there may be a possibility in the future of multiple different wows running with each expansion on their own servers.
---
Yeah he said 2H Fury for the **mace** because mace spec sucks.
---
I said the sword because I wasn't talking about fury.
---
Not only is this "typically" statement of your an anecdote and a bad one at that, but it doesn't even approach answering the question of how much damage they would add on average.
---
I don’t enjoy the BFA gameplay, the lore is interesting but that’s about it for me. I want classic so bad I want to meet people and actually get to know them and not rush through raids, I want my own “Leroy Jenkins” moment.
---
I can’t rationalize paying money until I can play classic.
---
They're not trying to fix anything right now, they're testing how much it takes to break stuff. And right now the log in and character creation are broken because there's too many people trying to log in all at once.
---
I’m going to be leveling up with my brothers who will be warrior/priest. I’m either going to be a mage or a rogue. My only question is: will having two cloth users leveling up together (mostly due to gear sharing) really be as bad as some people say? 
---
It seems like being able to provide portals and food and sheep would outweigh any cons relating to sharing gear while leveling up. What are your thoughts?
---
I couldnt even enter major cities without my pc freezing back then. Wasnt till 07 that i could raid
---
We'd have 100% crit eventually, though. I don't like the system, but from a development perspective it made sense.
---
You bought game time for classic that comes out in 3 months?
---
TFW you finally get that carrot on stick blizz dangling in front of you
---
Just got in!
---
Yes and sometimes it morphs into a strange affection/arousal.  If I walk by a dwarf hunter in the badlands I feel compelled to take off my robe and wizard hat and use my enormous tauren girth to show him why they call it Hammertoe's Digsite.
---
Scaling was bad, but Cross realm really killed the community aspect what was what made the game great, And Xrealm pvp was the same and when they added Russian's to it just killed it completely
---
Same here, they generate a hatred inside me that I can't control
---
no, classic zones scale up to 60. Outlands + Wrath scale to 80. Cata + MoP scale to 90.  WoD scales to 100, and legion scales to 110.
---
The reason they did this was because questing pretty much died due to how fast you level. You would start a zone and by the time you got done with the intro it was time to pack up and leave to the next.
---
So they brought in scaling so you could do the zone in its entirety if you want.
---
They also combined BC/Wrath and Cata/MoP so you could choose which xpacs you want to level in, most people hate outlands now cause its not very efficient so you can start wrath at 60 and stay until 80.
---
For the purposes of leveling, all of these changes are great cause you can actually quest now instead of dungeon queue spams. However for max level in the current xpac people dont care for it as much cause you cant just go 1 shot all the mobs in the zone which is more of a lazy thing than anything. My toon is pretty geared so most stuff dies in less than 5 hits but i can understand why people get annoyed cause it does feel like no matter how much gear you get it keeps scaling but you can infact outgear it.
---
Thats not why we got the bonus stress test, they just didn't finish all the tests they wanted to run last week.
---
Some people like the cringe of watching him idk, but I don't watch it my self, I just hear about the stupidest stuff while im talking with friends.
---
I feel good that I use my own time to promote streamers and make it easier for people to watch their content in a more convenient format. A lot of people have thanked me already, whats the problem?  I don't get any money for my time.
---
Made me lol irl
---
I mean that's still more engaging than mechanics that literally can't do anything because they don't pump out enough damage to accomplish anything. At least with geddon bombs it accomplished the goal of spreading people out lol.
---
Just play on a private server until classic launches. That’s what I’m doing
---
LOL!
---
I'm in!  
---
Aaand they restarted the server
---
OMG WHY CAN I NOT LOG IN!?
---
Agreed, I stopped playing after wotlk so I’m glad I never saw that tragedy
---
Your suggestion is just the same as the rating, though, but displaying percentages based on current level as opposed to the flat rating.
---
Yeah, who's this Chen asshole in my Warcraft 3 campaign!? /s
---
Asking the same question when you've already got your answer is actually the literal opposite of rational.
---
Yea breaking a rogue out of stealth and still getting sapped and he just restealths.... can’t wait haha
---
My I'm part doing
---
&gt; I cant wait to see raids without a bunch of flashing lights and timer trackers popping up all over my screen like a slot machine at a sleazy casino.
---
So you don't like interesting things that challenge your reaction time and abilities.
---
&gt;Some people think vanilla/TBC DPS rotations were boring, but I loved being able to pay attention to things other than my rotation.
---
They were boring, you spammed a single ability. Now you say you loved paying attention to things other than your rotation, but you just said previously you didn't like convoluted mechanics? I don't know what you're trying to get at here ...
---
I just get to logging into game server...… -- been this way for as long as I've tried today. Oh well, that is why it's a test.
---
Also, especially for casual players who will rarely see raids, the dungeon sets/blues etc you hunt being obtainable at 55-59 makes thhe game feel so coherent, not a major difference but it's something about enjoying the journey where, especially in bfa but even earlier too, you hit max level and all the gear you're wearing *becomes* trash and should be replaced with anything that requires max level to wear
---
You know I geared up toons in TBC and WOTLK and while it was definitely easier and took less time to level, I still had a ton of fun because well it was the old quests that we knew. Cata royally fucked all of that up.
---
I have seen this document. It looks pretty good. I still do believe in druids as tanks. But every time I actually play with one, the theorycraft and testing never seems to hold up. Even when I trust the players playing them to be good at the class. I think Taladril might not be doing a correct fury rotation.
---
Ok I’ve been meaning to ask... how??? I want a normal server nothing like “instant 60” how do I do that?
---
Should take a look at this. Especially the part where the damage taken gets compared between the two classes.
---
Also keep in mind that sitting for enrage is going to be less reliable in Classic wich will likely put Druids ahead on threat.
---
Hmmm. you're saying since they added a new version of spellbatching this would be a new unique thing? If it was possible in vanilla tho, shouldn't it be again?
---
For sure, I agree with all that. I'm not a layering apologist exactly, but I understand it's still a mystery and I still have faith that Blizzard will do the right thing. I was just expressing surprise that someone had a bad reaction to something that *if* layer hopping abuse is possible, makes it strictly harder.
---
I'm in but can't do shit
---
Bluepost suggests you leave it on this screen until you log in or get DC'd and to try again at that point.
---
To be honest, it is very convinient lol. I don't mind people doing this.
---
Same here, been logging into game server for over 90 minutes now lol
---
I see. Thanks.
---
Report as a bug.
---
I guarantee layering is being tested on classic for implementation on retail
---
Yeah, actually, idk why I'm complaining. It's just more for them to do... I just don't want them to fuck up, or overwork
---
I just don't see why anyone would do this except for an extremely small percentage, like less than .01%. People like fresh servers because it gives them a chance to be put on par with everyone. This just puts you behind everyone and there's no turning back.
---
Potential negatives I could see: a large number of tickets to GMs asking for their decision to prestige to be reverted, which wastes GMs' time.
---
With something like this appealing to so so few people, I think pretty much any negative effect is enough for me to say that it shouldn't be included.
---
AoE grinding will likely be more or less defunct between the loss of dynamic spawning and the sheer number of people leveling at launch.
---
They make their own water, so even if it is slower, it won't be by a notable amount.
---
I wonder how many fewer people are attempting to log on due to the fact that most of this stress test occurs during typical NA work / commute hours
---
Aaand the population is now at "locked"
---
At least I get the beta after this..
---
very convinient for me too
---
&gt; started seeing some serious gear check and mechanic-tesing fights.
---
I don't remember ever seeing either of those in vanilla dungeons.
---
Isnt layering ament to only be up for the first little bit maybe a month or so then its being removed?
---
Dude as a huge fan of maiden I found this pretty funny.
---
Even healing plate items that will drop for Horde?
---
I have told that story a few times already but still, it's my most memorable experience so here we go. When I hit 60 on my hunter I tamed frost saber or whatever they are called in winter spring. The purple bluish ones. Then I learned that there was a hidden epic mount the winter spring saber to optain but gated behind a massive time commitment because of the rep farming. Since I was nowhere near the gold for an epic mount I thought fuck it I will do it. How cool will it be if I am in my mount and have the exact same tiger running besides me? So I farmed and farmed the reputation needed and on the way got my gold together. Then I finally could afford it both gold and reputation wise and I felt soooo good. It was everything I wanted.
---
Then one patch later blizz removed hunter pets beeing visible while beeing mounted because they would sometimes bug out lol. I felt so betrayed.
---
Did they say so?
---
&gt;if you are human, and leveling 2h fury(no axe spec) mace is the unquestionable best option. 
---
He is saying if you are leveling 2h fury, take the mace. He is not saying if you take the mace, go fury.  
---
The primary advantage of weapon skill is it reduces your glancing blows.  
---
From the wiki:  **Glancing blows** are combat events that can occur when fighting a mob of equal or higher level.   
---
So how exactly is what I am saying an Anecdote? I am saying that weapon skill is far more valuable when you are equal or lower level than what you are hitting. This value is lost on the green mobs you kill as a leveling warrior.

COnfirmation that we should stick on the "Logging into game server" screen though.

I got in, only for them to restart the server 5 mins later lol
---
I got all the way in, then the client crashed after a few minutes and now I can't log back in. Wasn't there a grace period in the last stress test?
---
I'm not entirely convinced. This was certainly true back in vanilla but the nature of the internet has changed substantially. I'll be curious to see how active realm forums are in Classic.
---
We don't want them to say they'll fix it. We want them to fix it. Until it is fixed, that is what we will continue to want.
---
yeah. I'm not sure how long I was in that screen for, but it was a while. They're restarting the server right now, so might be a good time to try to get in
---
They generally don't put details about buffing/nerfing instances or raids in the patch notes.  You'll probably find an instance or two where they do and that will serve for you as proof that they always do.  But you'd be wrong.
---
Server restarted. Just got booted off :|
---
I got on, but I told my guild I was going to make a human with the same name I had. I had previously made a tauren named bullean. 
---
When I hit delete it spun on "deleting character", and after 10 min I gave up. After restarting and trying again...haven't been able to get back in.
---
Okay literally as I typed that I got to the character creation screen then DC'd. Sure hope they're getting some good stack telemetry or profiling data from this test :P
---
Finally got in but the server just went down.
---
I was in for a moment, \[Server\] told us all they are rebooting again
---
Having a level up reduce the power of your character is the opposite of making sense from a design perspective.
---
It was a poor solution to a problem that could have been mitigated in many other ways.

Got in, completed spider egg quest in NE area, then they restarted the server -_-

I lied and gave it one last try, got in just before "the last" server restart.

Yeah I've been the hardcore elitist, I've played the game since Vanilla but I'm gonna take Classic slow, try weird specs, just have fun. It'll take me a while to get to 60 and that's fine. Vanilla wasn't all about just doing endgame like it is now, there's interesting stuff at just about every level bracket. My friends and I are probably going to try and do stupid stuff like dungeons we're way too level for as well just to say we beat it if we can, I'm so excited
---
And his only emotion is 'pissy' lol

Ooo, just got a Login queue of ~400 instead of straight into the "Logging in to game server"

EDIT: No game servers available.
---
But... streamers... reeeeeeeeeeee?
---
Why does she say you're not a responsible person? Have you not remembered chores like dishes, taking out the trash, picking up the spawn? Or do you tell her you'll fix the toilet, build that bookshelf, etc but never get around to it? If it's either, she probably thinks you adding something fun will reduce what you normally get done. Maybe work on that and still split some time for let's say, reading a book or whatnot, so you can point out you get the adult stuff done and your 5hr/week reading, so you're showing her you can play and still be a responsible partner? If you do all your housestuff without her ever having to ask/remind you, then I've no idea why she's saying you're not responsible enough to play a game, I'm sorry man.
---
Dont worry, there will be "spell Batch" timers, guaranteed. lol You can force so many people to table flip. 
---
Meanwhile, my distracted ass, is PVE servering, cause I don't have time to get ganked with a non gaming spouse and a couple kids.
---
Cba it’s in one of the many other layering threads, gl
---
If you warrior is dying less than your mage you are doing something wrong. Mage is the one of the strongest levelers/soloers, and has more "Oh shit" buttons than anyone else in Vanilla.
---
server man said "Last one i promise" right before they reset it lol
---
Scaling is probably the best thing they've added in recent times. It's so nice to actually be able to finish a zone and quest where I want. Doing 2 quests before needing to change zones was stupid. 
---
Obviously that's not needed in classic, because experience gains aren't ridiculous like they are in retail.
---
Try "Táken"
---
let's just put it this way, my friends were way more impressed that I was running Windows on my PC than wow.
---
Was that implemented during CATA? I remember my friends and guild list dropping off hardcore during the middle of that expansion. WOD was a graveyard though and I ended up quitting and coming back to legion for a bit but BFA is probably the worst expansion  for me, so I haven't been subbed since I dinged cap.
---
Stop putting facts in the way of streamer hate
---
Once I hit 60 I definitely plan to visit STV and counter gank other 60s. People who corpse camp lowbies are scum and almost always terrible at the game.

Dude they don't belong it's not in the right context it's for little weabooos and Chinese kids. Fuck pandering for profit.. it's what ruined WoW. story got lazy as all fuck.

The age of pandas is tainted in cringe and laziness and the way they were implanted as playable isn't even proper. Greedy af goblins can be shaman and tauren priest or paldan? Lmfao lame. Nuke the fucking game. Pretty boy elfs don't even belong to horde in my traditionalist mindset ahahaha
---
Some people dont need AQ, sure. I have not memorized any BIS list so I'm not gonna argue. My point is simply that for any level 60 that is looking to raid will not be able to step into the endgame. Once phase 4(?) runs around and ZG is out, i'm sure that'll be step 1 for most people looking to raid and few people will bother with MC. But most will still need to go through several raids before moving on to the next. And most people arent just gonna get to speedrun through ZG and BWL to get to Naxx/AQ40. Sure, some people in a hardcore guild can get 5-10 friends in to help you out and you get some easy clears - potentially. But thats literally in my first post. Unless you're boosted, you'll be spending time clearing previous content to be eligible for the current one. Which makes all content relevant(But not for everyone, as you say with AQ for your class)

Sounds like utter BS. They don't live flag small twitch accounts like that, but congrats, the prio seems to be for people with the real beta so I guess he has it now.
---
Can't you already do this?
---
stress test failing bois
---
I agree, looking forward to being able to enjoy the leveling process again. With the second toon to mix it up now and then.
---
And then they sent a new message: "He's lying."
---
No one is asking a question. People are raising an issue with the game during beta and you seem to be triggered by this fact. Why are you taking it so personal when people point out a broken mechanic that needs fixing?
---
An accurate representation of how Asmongold plays warrior.
---
Just to clarify, Farm raiding means raids you already outgear and have on Farm status. 
---
Farming as Prot is actually not bad, you have some AoE, and if your gear is good you can AoE farm high level stuff.

It may be a different system but still the same concept with the same issues. 
---
It's like saying "Hey this concrete road is busted to shit and filled with potholes. Ya know what I bet will fix it, a new concrete road!"
---
Never forget the Luffa.
---
yup 2 hours of "logging into server"
---
I can't beat you I never got an invite /kms
---
&gt;. It totally ruins that aspect completely when my toon decked out in full raid gear and months of progression still takes the same amount of time to kill bears and wolves as it did 10 levels ago.
---
Thats not how it works. It scales to your level, not your gear. 
---
While it is a problem while levelling, its not a problem in the circumstances you're giving.
---
I get why you might hate it, but I think there is good merit for it to exist. Like, you wanting to level with friends who are 5 levels higher than you, or maybe you want to quest together.
---
no worries yo, still cool you decided to look into things  
---
for arms, personally i'd go axe.  
---
Sword spec is definitely awesome but when we are picking between high dmg and axe spec vs lower dmg, sword spec, and 5 weap skill i'm going to lean axe. Its all debatable, one may be better than the rest but they all work well enough.
---
It'd be a redundant system iff:  
---
1. There were gem slots on literally every single piece of gear.  
---
2. The gem slot count corresponded appropriately to the amount of stat on that piece of gear (e.g., a weapon with 100 haste would have 40 go to crit, while a weapon with 50 haste would only have 20 go to crit).  
---
3. They completely removed the bonuses for slotting gem colors.  
---
4. Gems would need to stop allowing primary stats to be slotted, since they could not be reforged.  
---
5. Reforging didn't let you reforge to stats already on the gear. Gemming does. You can gem +crit onto an item that already has +crit.  
---
Without making a very complicated gemming system, it's impossible to make a system that fixes all 5 of the above problems without creating other problems (such as using multiple gemslots in a piece of gear to "partial reforge" into multiple diff stats).   
---
Reforging was not redundant with JC any more than JC was redundant with enchanting. It was awesome.
---
DAOC.  That brings back memories.  Nothing quite like losing XP for dying.  Combined with its exponential leveling grind, play sessions seemed to be measured in fractions of a level
---
At least there wasn't a "Kappa" or "PepeHands" somewhere in there.
---
Which makes me wonder - do Blizzard employees shitpost in Twitch Chat like the rest of us?
---
That explains why it got so toxic recently, and now all the new people complaining about it being toxic when it hasn't always been this way.
---
I've seen videos of people hitting for quadrillions. The power creep is so funny in d3. I remember when the xpac first launched I was hyped to be critting for a couple million. Torment 6 was impossibly hard
---
Even if I don't sit, it still feels like I am way ahead of the druids. It could just be a perception thing. Perhaps I am more geared than them and I dont realise that. But like, its been like 4 months since I have seen someone rip hakkar off a warrior tank. Recently ran with a bear who said he was going all out on hakkar popping pummeler and everything. Rogue ripped off him like 40 seconds in and I was miles ahead in threat. I even started hitting hakkar a bit after him. I didn't pop my cds at all. I know its all anecdotal but  I figured I would at least see one good bear at some point....
---
"Criticism
---
Gear choices are up for debate. My warrior rotation is not perfect but I have experience from tanking in raids. 5 tests per setup is not much, and there might be quite a lot of RNG, especially in damage taken results."
---
 Everyone is just armchair epeenFLEX about how they were so 1337 and BiS (which was a term I don't remember anybody using in Vanilla) and raided NAXX bro. Most people just stood on the AH roof and begged for carries in MC lolllll.
---
Doesn’t help that everyone thought T0 was pre raid BiS.
---
You are right saying video games are for dumb people is a bit extreme
---
They reset server and I’m back to “logging in to game server”
---
Thanks man truly means a lot!

Just got in myself.  My previous character was there, and I was able to make a new one.
---
Yesterday out of my m+ chest I got a massive upgrade, a 415 belt with haste, upgrade from 370.  I was happy sure, but I have no idea what the name of the item is.  I just call it 415 haste belt.  Warforging/titanforging and even m+ have really diminished the value of certain items.  Sure there are still trinkets in game that are BiS, but only if you get lucky with the forges.  In current BFA I only know the names of a handful of trinkets, honestly dont know a single piece of gear my main wears outside of the 2 trinkets.  So i'm really looking forward to being excited at drops again, and not let down that the slot machine didn't go in my favor this time.
---
How much is carrot on a stick? 3%? Won't help you escape the pally police pursuing Justice.
---
I know that's what he was saying about the mace. I was talking about the sword, and not fury. Are you just not reading what I said on purpose or something?
---
The anecdote was that you "typically" fight monsters of a lower level.
---
Not only this but the wiki part you quoted isn't about the classic patch. On the classic patch players have a chance to perform a glancing blow against mobs equal to 10% plus 2% per point of difference between attack rating and defense. Mob defence is level*5. So you can glance even on green mobs depending on where your skill is at but not if the skill is max for your current level.
---
Yeah, people don’t realize that most semi hardcore players will go to level 30 in the first week(s) easily. Rather than spend another 2 weeks getting all the BiS gear they will be continuing to level and do more challenging content. 
---
In Vanilla I remember starting on a new released server (Balnazzar) to rush to level 60 and absolutely struggling to complete some of the 30-50 instances because there simply wasn’t that many players at these levels yet and people were in mostly green gear still. 
---
Just wait until guilds attempt MC/Onyxia/Kazzak etc for the first time (40-60 days after launch presumably) before people have high tradeskills to craft fire res gear, only have a few UBRS runs under their belts and limited gear, it will definitely be hard to beat these things when undergeared. There weren’t shortcuts in Vanilla to get good gear, you had to farm during the day for fire res mats for your guild to raid that night etc.
---
Titanforging ruined WoW for me, no doubt.
---
Slowing lvling way down would not please anyone tho.
---
Right? Shit is amazing for chasing down noobs or getting away from a gank squad. That boy doesn't know what he's talking about.
---
I'd like to commend Blizzard: the streamers didn't get priority, and their actual players were given a chance to participate. Well done!
---
I was a D2 player. Like you said, most people didn't play D1. It wasn't really that popular or even considered that great. I agree that it was much slower and methodical though, I have seen gameplay and it plays a lot more like Dark Stone. That's not a bad thing, but it's a different game entirely, imo.
---
D2 on the other hand had about 5-10 mobs on the screen a lot of the time and you had a lot of tools and builds that could deal with and slaughter them all depending on what you were playing. Obviously that is a far stretch from 'hundreds of mobs', but that was considered a LOT back then and was their technical limits for the time. In spirit, D3's combat is following suit of D2. If D2 could handle 15, 20 or 30 mobs on the screen, it would have had them, imo. You can definitely argue otherwise, but then we are just at an impasse.
---
If you're a hardcore D1/2 fan and hate D3, that is fine. I'm not implying that D3 is better or anything. I do like it best, but I agree that they fucked up the loot pretty badly and that at launch it was one of the worst games ever made. That being said, on the topic of combat, I feel like it stayed true to Diablo 2 in that regard, it was just poorly balanced with horrible loot systems.
---
fucking rip layering is just as bad as sharding
---
To you sure but if your life is put together then what’s the issue with putting some priority on video games?
---
I hope blizzard takes on the “summit” approach that a lot of other developers have followed. I feel like wow classic would be the perfect platform for  “what do you guys want” vs all these features they add, remove, nerf, and then add again.
---
Ask us, we will tell you.
---
Theres been a few nice sets, though i dont remember if i really liked any of the pally ones.  Warlocks have actually been pretty lucky overall, and thats the class ive played the most....so i was pretty lucky overall with tmog options.
---
20's PvP in Ashenvale. Was the best. Ashenvale is one of my favorite zones. I actually turned off any video/music I had going to listen to the music there.
---
I'm in, thank god. Only two hours
---
If it makes you feel better, someone just linked a video of a guy doing 15 in a row down Auberdine beach :)
---
Good luck fren
---
Did anyone from the EU get in?
---
Made it in than they reset, now I'm back to "logging in to game server" Can't say I'm surprised but I'm definitely gonna be disappointed if I can't get in for the actual stress test part.
---
You are singin' my goddamn song, sir. My greatest fear for Classic is the demand for TBC is so great Blizz simply rolls out the next expansion just like they did the first time 'round, including all the changes (which I advocated and enjoyed at the time) that set the game on the path it's continued down to this day. And history repeats.
---
I want Classic to herald a revival of the genre sans all the crap that's infested it over the past 15 years. No unlimited instant/fast travel that makes the great big world the developers created for us to run around in feel roughly as expansive as my living room. No ever-steepening power curve making everything that came before obsolescent. No cash shop that incentivizes the bean counters to put all the coolest art assets behind a paywall. No obsession with 1v1 "balance" and esport fuckery.
---
I want at least some MMOs to go back to being proper-feeling *RPGs* again, made with the understanding that flavor and immersive world building are every bit as important as mechanics. I'm hoping Classic can help make that happen.
---
Seriously, what kinda joke is this sub when they think they could have taken what is likely a janky backend slapped together mess than was Nost and try and pass it off as an official retail product. In noooooo way would that ever fly in any profession game studio, *ever*
---
Still stuck at logging into server l, anyone else?
---
That's because expansions aren't "expansions" they are effectively "replacements". 
---
They took kalimdor and eastern kingdoms, two giant living breathing continents full of relevant content and replaced them with outland, then northrend, etc. The world was at it biggest most complete point in vanilla just like OP says here.
---
Hi, /u/Zyntos
---
Eh streamers honestly could care less. It's more publicity / ads per viewer for them. 
---
No such thing as bad press!
---
Blood elves and nothing else
---
Ahh so your a dickhead, gotcha.
---
Bad call, no lock trainers in nelf lands.
---
Yeah, or shadow meld .
---
Anyone experiencing anything like this? In game it is around 40w and 50c on an RX580. Any thoughts?
---
It's pretty, pretty, pretty good. It's pretty good.
---
I thought you could raid BRD? Solely because MC was within it.
---
This and the Argent Dawn trinket were the most common ones in the game. I can't wait!
---
That has zero to do with the issue we are talking about.  Ion talked about realm transfers within the context of a question about adding paid services to the game.
---
That is entirely different from the issue of having to delayer a realm that has friends and guilds split across many layers.
---
Maybe you need to go watch these interviews yourself before you tell others to do it.
---
back up and working again.
---
Do you not track your quests?
---
Interesting you mentioned Hakkar. Druid threat feels really scuffed on that Boss in general. I cant actually hold aggro worth a damn there either even with Pummelers and full DPS gear on, but I rip threat off the same Warriors on other bosses if I try.
---
I'm just making the point that "sharding" was supposed to only occur in starting zones to help with the crowd crush during classic server launch. The community issue with sharding being that "phasing is immersion breaking and not in the spirit of a cohesive classic world." 
---
Now it's morphed into "we are going to have continent wide 'layering' through phase 1."
---
Unfortunately early on we're seeing that the phasing concerns aren't being resolved by layering. To some players seeing bad phasing clips like this worrisome.
---
They've already greatly expanded the time frame and zones that can be potentially impacted by phasing issues, now we're also seeing that the layers don't seem to be as sticky as we were hoping.
---
They still have time to fix the issues, but IF the current iteration of layering or something similar survived to see launch it would be really disappointing for many players. Hopefully it doesn't come to that.
---
Streamers are, the normal players not...
---
I was before server restart
---
Too much fps. I believe it was early sc2 that had uncapped fps loading screens frying gpus.
---
Give an example.
---
priest isn't super fast but it's steady and cosy. very little downtime, quite strong at 1v1 wpvp, etc.
---
its funny because im having a good time playing with friends in bfa while i dont have beta
---
I feel like those of us who quit when I did (just after Cata) wouldn't even recognize retail if we tried to play it.
---
Thanks, I was wondering about that lol.  Been sitting there for over 90 minutes &amp; wasn't sure if I should cancel it or not.
---
This would be heavily criticized as artificial gating.
---
Hi, /u/grizzlesax, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
I was such a noob in vanilla.  Bought the $2 trial disc at Best Buy with a friend.  Made an undead warlock, used a mining pick as a weapon and just melee'd mobs to death.  By level 5 or 6 I thought this was the worst game ever made lol.  Then I made a warrior named Destructo (probably from watching DBZ at the time) and painfully got that guy to 20 or whatever the old trial discs cap was and was hooked.  Proceeded to create about 8 different toons on 8 different servers/factions, got most to level 20ish, with my highest being a 30 shaman.  Then BC launched.  
---
I was not a smart 18 year old lol.
---
Guess I’ll try again in another 3 hours.
---
My mans forgot about Babagaya Shadowclef. Maybe not in "Night Elf" terf but, it is in ratchet. Which is easy as fuck to get to.
---
What guild? I played all of vanilla but I haven’t played wow in years so I am a bit noobish now as well. I have a lot to relearn
---
I was a teenager back then too and now have a wife and kids. I plan on just playing when I can just like I do with other games now. If it's a deep emotional thing for you, then maybe it is a problem you should consider.
---
Oh boy. Do you remember the Felguard + The Black Book combo ? That guy would outdamage pretty much anyone while being unkillable by both melees and casters (especially if you had the T2 +130 Magic resistance). It looked like this :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RJngKD1gQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RJngKD1gQ)
---
Getting spell locked for even a couple of seconds in that situation is almost certain death. So what you should do is pretend to cast a spell, like a lesser healing wave and just side step like a half second after casting it.
---
Basically you bait the kick, once it's used you can free cast. They can only stop you by Kidney Shot, gouge, blind, or vanish &amp; cheap shot. If they do any of those it can move momentum back in your direction.
---
Rogues are a momentum class. Interrupt their rhythm and you can take over the fight.
---
That's how it always worked. If you  are in ilvl 400 gear right now, you're going to absolutely destroy any 8.0 world content.
---
At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what race you are but rather which faction you are alligned.
---
If the dwarves wanted to side with the Horde, I'd totally welcome a Dwarven district in Orgrimmar.
---
Or we could just end this silly hostility and get along.
---
Gnomes perhaps not though.
---
I hate all alliance races
---
Because you wife and mother of your kids said no?? You really gonna go against that over a video game?
---
Video games don’t have any priority. Didn’t think I had to explain that to someone that’s married and with kids.
---
Tanking paladin gear would be an easy niche to fill too; plate with Defense *and* spell damage/healing in place of the usual Strength for better threat gen, and maybe a set bonus somewhere that makes one or more of your Judgements taunt.
---
This is a bug that blizzard has commented on and said they’re working on it. If that’s honesty not good enough, realistically what do you want?
---
Yeah, when they announced it last week.
---
Fuck yeah. We used it to get into SW bank and old outlands inside of deadmines. There were a lot of good opportunities to use it pretty much anywhere
---
I think a longer cool down would suffice. The only reason(s) to ever legit hop layers is to be with friends / guildies. Those are fairly permanent decisions. One wouldn't need to hop back and forth, all friends / guildies would merge to the same layer and boom, its done for good. I say give that shit a 3 day (or more) cool down.
---
I think you need to atleast get to 5/5 illumination and 5/5 holy power which is 30 talent points, and then you can go rest into prot and I think 21 points is enough for blessing of sanctuary. (Don't think holy shock is mana efficient)
---
FYI I haven't played vanilla as I started tbc release, but I've been fiddling with specs and this or a holy/Ret build for PvP is gonna be my go to. The holy Ret build is basically 32/0/19 which allows for seal of command and holy shock. The idea is that you can pummel someone in if need be.
---
There are no beta keys.
---
The same way they do crusader enchants or lower level potions and the such on retail. They just have a tool tip that says the item loses its effectiveness above X level. Heirlooms stop giving bonus xp above certain levels.
---
&gt; But there were a lot of problems with MoP; mostly the fact that it was an 8 (?) year old game that already had systems and a culture that was getting out of control.
---
Systems and a culture don't make a game bad, though. The gameplay was awesome.  
---
Flying sucks for World PvP, yes. But Timeless Isle was incredible world PvP.  
---
The raids were incredible.  
---
PvP was awesome. Much better than Cata/WotLK, though not as good as BC.  
---
&gt; Numbers were out of control. MoP was the time when they said they were starting to approach the soft cap for how big numbers can get in their systems (HP, damage, etc.) and ended up having to do a stat squish in WoD.  
---
Numbers are just a feelsy thing. There's no problem with big numbers.  
---
&gt; Gold was starting to get out of control.  
---
Also a feelsy thing, but one could say this had been going on since BC. Vanilla epic mount was 1k. Epic flying in BC was 5k. Tundra mount in WotLK was 20k. 2seater flying Vial of the Sands in Cata was ~50k.  
---
&gt; Lots of controversial features too, like legendaries for everyone, LFR, etc.  
---
Agreed here. Legendary cloaks weren't terrible, but I agree that I dislike it philosophically. LFR was shitty, but that was introduced in Cataclysm.  
---
&gt; I would still probably put it behind WotLK and (maybe) BC  
---
You think WotLK was &gt; BC?  
---
Umm let's look at the PvP: DK's 1-shotting everyone for half of the expansion. Beastcleave. TSG. Lust in arenas. **It was so fucking bad that MLG dropped WoW arenas despite their massive popularity during BC.**  
---
How about raiding? I'll admit that Ulduar is one of the top 3 raids in the entire game (with Throne of Thunder from MoP and Karazhan from BC being the other two in the top three; no order given). But how about the rest? ICC was decent, but dragged on for literally over a year. ToGC was the biggest slap in the face of a raid tier I've ever seen. You could literally pug 4/5 bosses in the heroic version on their first-week releases. Naxxramas was... a re-release.  
---
I'll admit that WotLK really breathed some new life into fishing (dalaran coin, the northrend competition, the salty title, fish feasts) and cooking (great feasts/fish feasts). And I'll admit that the achievement system was awesome (though people dislike it in classic). But it introduced heroic mode, which is basically the first round of creating LFR. Instead of raids just being hard, they made heroics hard and normals easy.  
---
MoP did all of that + more for professions. Fishing had a major revitalization in MoP, and so did Cooking with the 6 Ways.  
---
In my opinion, WotLK is not even better than Cataclysm. Cata's LFR is met with WotLK's heroics. Cata actually had a LOT of good raids (especially Firelands, which is probably #4 overall). Although it ruined the game with flying, I'll never forgive WotLK for ruining WoW arenas.  
---
BC might trump MoP. It did nothing for the secondary professions, but JC was a great addition, engineers got the mote extractor, the raids were all amazing and the PvP was the best WoW ever had it.  
---
In my opinion: BC ?= MoP &gt; Vanilla &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cata &gt;= WotLK &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Legion/WoD/etc all so bad can't even really rank them anymore
---
Let them have fun. You sound mad because you’re not in the beta
---
you don't really need water if you don't overcast. i lvled 1-60 on ND solo basically doing shield &gt; mindblast &gt; mindflay &gt; mindflay &gt; wand to death. you just need to keep your wand up to date.
---
I did 10 once and it was so satisfying... I didn't go for an 11th, I just wanted to bask in it.
---
Cool, thanks. Flying to Ratchet is no big deal.
---
681 fps on a (I'm assuming) 60 Hz monitor. 621 of those frames are wasted my friend.
---
&gt; any level 60 that is looking to raid will not be able to step into the endgame.
---
I mean... yes it will? Hunters are pulling what, 400 DPS in Naxx? A hunter in pre-raid BiS with a bit of ZG thrown in can do 200-300. 100 DPS won't make or break a raid with 30 DPS.
---
The only time you'd need to xfer is AFTER the layers merge if there's an obscene queue due to major overpopulation. Reread our entire exchange. This is where we wound up.
---
And, yes, this very subject came up and the response was more servers and talks of elective transfers.
---
Now move along.
---
Thunder bluff is the best bank alt city, but tauren have the longest run to get to their city.  Plus those fucking swoops.
---
In ~2-3 years, the people that want to stay in Vanilla will be the minority. Always piss off the minority.
---
Really hope I don't end up on a streamer server.
---
Yes, but still asking after they recognized the issue and said they are working on the fix won't do anything more.
---
You should try BFA I hear they give away 110s
---
This is actually a pretty genius solution, although I'd still prefer no scaling. It's one of those mechanics that mostly just serves to remind you that you're in a treadmill. And even with nested scaling, you still can't do the vanilla-style of levelling in which you return to zones at a later stage, as each progression would have to have an in-zone "start" and "end" range reachable with solely the quests in that zone.
---
Except you should do it anyway for the RP aspects, not for seeing bigger numbers.
---
I am. I am playing the game properly. Leveling.
---
I mean more about it going away with phase 2.
---
Try going into settings and cap your fps. You don't need 681. I cap mine at 100 for a 60hz monitor. Keeps my GPU chillin.
---
Because he could help them finish it off.
---
You don't belong in the game either:)
---
Oh yea run/fly to ratchet from rut'theran/auberdine every 2 levels 1-20, sounds fun.
---
that debuff wasn't because stats had scaled out of hand, it was because of a very specific warrior who had constructed an avoidance set where he had 100% avoidance+block against bosses in black temple, so that even though he had low hp, he took very little healing... and then started bragging/blogging about it. it was a fun but gimmicky build and sunwell aura made sure it wouldn't be viable in cutting edge content. the stats on that set weren't out of hand, he was using lower tier items to get to full passive avoidance, but it's pretty obvious why that kind of cheesy tanking option would be bad to keep around.
---
edit: anyway that doesn't argue against your point, it's just that sunwell isn't really related to your point.
---
I'm in! Again...
---
I'd love a screenshot of this.
---
I cant rember when X-realm was added, i think it was Wotlk. when ever it was it totally killed the community aspect of wow sins it came with phasing and LFG, I don't even remember the last time i talked to someone while doing a dungeon, but during classic and Tbc did lost of, ive still got friends i talk to today whom i did dungeons with back in 2005/2006 and that was what made the game (imo) great the community aspect the know whos-who aspect of the game, even the forums were alive with people talking and bantering, example, was a guy on my vanillia server called Laptaru, a warlock who was known for arguing that warlocks could tank raids and having people that if you ever saw them youd go out of way to go and try kill them, because at level 30 they had the audacity to gank you when you was levelling in stv, hell i rember when i got level 60 the first thing i did was go to Org and kill a mage that ganked me at level 30 cause i saw him standing in the bank, ah good times. Stuff like that made the game amazingly fun.
---
I tried that, but I know that online databases are sometimes incomplete, and that looked like way too few trainers.
---
well said. I already told my girlfriend when this comes on I will be spending a lot of time my time and "our time" playing this until I get good. She wasn't happy but she understood. lol.
---
It's a stress test, this is a good way to stress the server. Even in live streamers have crashed the games doing their lvl1 runs and shit.
---
what's tier 3 autism like?
---
Since it requires DM to complete, I doubt any part of it will be available before Phase 2.
---
I am just operating off my memory. I remember not struggling with killing shit or dying, just needed lots of water.
---
It's a common thing in the modern video game industry to use things like beta tests and early access to act solely as advertisements, or use them to have several release cycles.
---
Blizzard is no stranger to this.
---
Family.. wife??? What are those? :D
---
ya know, last time i was annoyed by the crying of people who hated that streamers played a videogame and didnt understand stress tests...this time im sadistically excited.
---
Said no? Now for sure they are a priority no doubt
---
What's WAR ?
---
better than choosing a partner for 1% tax refund
---
Don't be like that, because you know if they just worked on fixing it without saying anything, people would be jumping down their throats about "why haven't they said anything".
---
I leveled multiple times to 60 in vanilla so if the content is the same I will just need to skim it again
---
Can confirm. At 32 I am very grumpy. 
---
Also wtf is wrong with  your spelling. Its fucking PLAYED.
---
Maybe I could have worded it better. I guess what I mean is along the lines of that quote "Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of any game." I personally prefer to have a character who I think is/looks cool and not just the most powerful option for my class
---
Yeah I was trying to suggest what you are, just did so poorly.
---
On a similar note, I am questioning if I want to spend 900g on a stupid mount I dont want or wait 3+ months while I grind that sweet winterspring frostsaber and then drop the 900g on that. HMMMMMM
---
I fully expect it to be fucked.
---
But I've just accepted it and look forward to when it's going away (hopefully before shit like devilsaur mafias start going ham)
---
Thank you for the answer. I was told there were no e-mails this time and the only way to find out was logging in... Thank you so much for clearing it up!
---
You just have to think about what races can actually be warlocks, figure out what town they start in and what their big town is.  That rules everything else out.  No cows, no elves.  That rules out 2 of the 3 big cities on that continent.  The other city is shared by 2 races.  Or that's the theory.  There is that place in Thunder Bluff where you can go train portals and stuff they can't actually be...
---
gratz.  I'm not as lucky.  I'm a day 1 vanilla too but not beta for me :(
---
Don't do it until level 10. Your class quests for Imp and Voidwalker won't be available overseas.
---
Cry, Crybaby, cry.
---
&gt;With **awful mechanics**, **awful classes**, flying mounts, lfg tools, hand holding in anything you do, etc.
---
Yeah I don't agree with those 2 points at all, from a mechanics perspective the end game in Live is worlds above Vanilla. And the Class design is better, classes are more interesting to play and half of them aren't just broken and don't function in the way they were intended. The fact that Druids don't have a res and Paladins don't get a taunt are just clear oversights that never should have happened. Not to mention the atrocious balance among the classes, there's nothing about that which adds to the game.
---
&gt;The very least the devs can do is ditch flying altogether, ditch lfg/lfr entirely, remove all the quest map helpers, make the world super difficult and make quests time consuming. Though I fear the game in general may be too far gone to really roll much of this back and the dreams of a Classic reborn in Retail might be more of a distant future IE. WoW 2 deal, rather than some changes in an expansion.
---
LFR essentially is the only justification for why Mythic exists and why Blizzard began to invest so many resources into developing better raiding content. All the best raids in the game imo have come post MoP, nothing before that is anywhere near the raids they've made since that change and the only reason they can do that is because LFR guarantees more people will see the content. WoW 2 is never happening, they aren't gonna get rid of flying, and all these other changes you're suggesting would just make people quit the game on the spot.
---
Blizzard could implement every Vanilla dream change people have for the modern game tomorrow and the game would have less subs in a year then it does now.
---
The dudes wife even said he was irresponsible...but sure let’s get this guy into playing WoW and ignore his family.
---
If Blizz was smart, they would have made a glyph in WOTLK for NE jumps.

---
&gt; I love the feeling of pooling energy and getting someone in a kidney, and then unloading several backstabs into them for high burst... doesn't really seem possible with 60 energy backstabs in vanilla.
---
Closest to that would probably be Sap &gt; Restealth &gt; Cheapshot &amp; Cancel Attack &gt; Expose Armor &amp; Cancel Attack &gt; Restealth &gt; Ambush or a similar such opener. Or just go for big burst with Cold Blood into an Ambush or Eviscerate. Or stack Vigor with Nightslayer for 120 energy combos (Not recommended, Vigor's pretty trash all things considered). You could also get Thistle Tea. Suffice to say, there's combos plenty. 
---
Keep in mind energy is very different in vanilla, not influenced by stats, but rather a 20 energy per 2 seconds tick (40 with Adrenaline Rush). If you time this well, you can attack right before a tick happens to get essentially 20 extra energy. 
---
Anyway, comboing aside, Rogue's fine. They aren't by any means "undisputed kings" of PvP as some would claim, which is mostly a result of World of RogueCraft blowing up like it did (which wasn't 1.12 by-and-large and irrelevant nowadays beyond the comedy value), but they are far from a bad pick. 
---
Stealth gives you a massive amount of control in WPvP, you pick your own battles and providing you haven't been dotted up can escape them with ease. In battlegrounds their roles are more limited, certainly, but they are still great flag defenders and any competent rogue will happily be taken in a premade. But therein lies the crux, competence. Rogues don't exactly have the highest skillcap, but they certainly have a very high one (as do most classes) and mastering a rogue will let you do incredibly well in PvP against most classes. 
---
There's plenty of more recent PvP videos and duel examples you could search for if you're still on the fence, but if you like the look and style of a rogue and your only reservation is your PvP strength I wouldn't worry at all. They're more than fine.
---
Beta access, whatever.
---
That link doesn’t seem to work.
---
Hi, /u/KelevraHodds
---
Meant to add there is also lists of rare, unique looks, spawned etc
---
I wouldn't want to see it in classic because it's such a departure from the original leveling model.
---
That said, I do like the idea of level scaling. I don't know how WoW handled it because I quite long before it was implemented. I did like the way SWTOR had it, though I haven't played that game since the previous expansion. For me the exponential growth in power and going back to, say, Northshire Abbey and killing a wolf by merely glancing in its general direction feels a little too "dragon ball z" to me. As a game mechanic it's great, it's a great carrot-on-a-stick to motivate me to keep chuggin' along, and it's nice to be able to wade through old content with ease.
---
From an immersion standpoint I find it counter-intuitive, though. I like level scaling in SWTOR because while it was still easy to grossly overgear content you were scaled down to, it felt a little less ridiculous and a little more organic. For me, it's more immersive. I don't dislike the traditional "I'm level 110 Goku stronk now", I just find it immersion-breaking when I'm trying to take the story and stuff seriously.
---
I would recommend a steamer Alodar to watch in your spare time. He’s in his 40’s as well and plays the game. He’s so fun to watch and really hypes me up for classic with all the information he knows
---
Thanks for the response
---
Frontflips*
---
Does that factor in talents? If I have improved frostbolt I can shoot them off a lot faster than the fireballs (fireball rank 4 untalented is 3 seconds)
---
Very sound advice.
---
You should take a look at /r/RaisedByNarcissists .
---
Thanks for the post.
---
That’s the plan
---
I believe a lot of dungeons had a 10-man cap. So you could probably raid SM Cath or some of the higher lv dungeons.
---
Thanks for the post
---
There is SOME scaling with gear. 8.0 world content, at least at bfa launch, scaled to about 340 ilvl. I don't think they continued to scale it forward with 8.1, but there were plenty of threads and blue posts discussing the situation when the xpac launched.
---
I have never plyed anything
---
I disagree.  I oppose transmog not because of nostalgia, but because gear and recognizing each others gear is an important part of the reward system and accomplishments in vanilla.  It's also important from a gameplay perspective because it helps you gauge your opponent's power before you pick a fight and/or while you're fighting them.
---
They've spoke to this before - Classic is significantly easier to develop for, since the audience is almost universally united in what they want, whereas Retail is made up of an order of magnitude more player audiences: the carebears, the no lifers, the casuals, RPers, everyone else in between. It's truly a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario with everything, cause if you advance one group's interests, you'll more often than not get complaints from the other group which is ideologically the opposite. 
---
I really feel for Ion, he's really done the best he can in trying to appease all the groups and not tell any single one that they're no longer welcome in modern WoW. Most people are reasonable and understand that, but there is unfortunately a significant number (a vocal minority) of  trolls on this sub/ /r/wow which try and label him as a hack and that he has no idea what makes classic classic and what the most important elements of classic are. When in reality, quite literally nothing could be further from the truth, he's the perfect person for the classic project since it's his true passion, where he really got started on wow and you can see that in literally any interview he does.
---
I've always mained an orc, but two of my favorite areas have always been Tirisfal Glades and Silverpine Forest, especially the latter. Don't ask me why, I don't know. I just really like them.
---
Dude, I plyed Vanilla. IDK about you
---

I raided classic -- this really wasn't that big of a deal to us.
---
No other tank has a taunt....... or tier gear with defense.
---
First off it’s a joke. Secondly, if you disagree you’re missing the point of OPM.

Even if it was a close fight, which it wouldn’t, I imagine Saitama would finally be able to enjoy a fight again.

This is the best outcome. Have a streamer join a group and lose a rare spawn. I'm glad this was captured so it can get some eye balls.
---
All sounds good to me... Aaaaand now I'm going to spend all night playing with talent trees! Thanks for your help!
---
Yeah but your endgame rotation is 1 button.
---
It sounds like you know where to draw the line for responsibility. Ask her a be more considerate of hobbies that make you happy and free for a few hours.
---
Pretty much this.  I had 0 interest in classic when it was announced.  I remembered the classes weren't super fun to play, you died alot, and this is 2019 that'll never work for me.  But as months and months of BFA went on with the endless treadmill for the slot machine, running freehold for the 100th time to get a trinket at a higher ilvl than I already had last season which is now outdated it started to at least be more open to classic.  
---
Then I started watching a few classicasts and got really hyped when the streamers were invited to Blizzard the week before the beta started.  I immediately opted in and have been watching a stream of beta basically daily now.   Just from watching I could tell I just missed playing an actual RPG.  I do believe the classes on BFA right now all play much much better than in classic, but pretty much everything else is so much more appealing to me.  Even just seeing a lock with both dots and immolate was making me flip out like woa I forgot that a thing.  Classes had so much flavor and customization, even though their rotations for the most part aren't amazing.  
---
So for me classic is appealing more to me than BFA.  BFA only has the current feel of classes (which all of them except demo/ele for me I enjoyed much more in Legion) and raiding with guild, basically everything else classic wins.
---
Kharazhan is my jam, loved every sec of it.
---
I mean it's not that far. Not sure if you remember classic but, trainers aren't peppered everywhere. Most of the time you have to fly back to org to train spells as horde.
---
You are trying to be De-Man.
---
Bear form is fantastic for tanking while leveling.
---
Most warriors are specced Fury/Arms while leveling so you have the advantage of being feral and actually specced to tank.
---
As long as your group understands threat/aggro, kill-order, and giving you a second to establish threat, you're good. (Even better if they undstand LoS pulling especially with humanoids that run away)
---
Nah I agree with OP. There are many questions and bugs I'd like addressed but you know for every person who would actually test it there are five others who will just blindly follow asmongold.
---
I for one would like to know if gnomes size is going to be down scaled and if so, does the model actually allow you to get into the same spaces before the retail model height change? 
---
Who knows. It's sad you don't really see that much threads on discussion of bugs and the really small discrepancies. You see a lot of esfand and asmongold though.
---
&gt; On the classic patch players have a chance to perform a glancing blow against mobs equal to 10% plus 2% per point of difference between attack rating and defense. Mob defence is level*5. So you can glance even on green mobs depending on where your skill is at but not if the skill is max for your current level.
---
Got a source? I don't doubt it I am just legitimately interested in any confirmed mechanics for Classic. 
---
Yea, if it was efficient to hit high level mobs or like weapon skill isn't increasing fast enough I can definitely see increased value going to weapon skill. But it would seem that given our current knowledge of mechanics in Classic, its better to take the Axe.
---
k blizz will start releasing games around a schedule that's convenient for you, never mind if they are finished or not.
---
*plied
---
Yeah I'm just throwing hypotheticals against the wall and seeing what seems like the most like ly possibility they would go with.
---
Shit I thought they would use the normal mount structure where the riding skill costs a lot 90% and mounts cost the least 10%.
---
Didn't think to get one :(
---
But I think Asmongold got it on stream.
---
Front load your spells, wand to death for 5 seconds so you get full regeneration from Spirit Tap.
---
Bada bing bada boom, you got a level 60 toon.
---
OK I found proof for your claim: https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17622582987
---
And yeah, I can see that being seen as bullshit. But at the same time, I think to say you farmed for months and months and didn't get any powerful is disingenuous.
---
There was some good parts to that, I think. Especially in the first week or so, how the world was actually threatening. To me, the worse problem was the progression of 110-120, and not the scaling. Especially for BFA because you lost more than you gained levelling up.
---
Butane
---
I'm looking forward to classic but can't stand dumbass comments like these
---
Go on then, tell us what endgame content vanilla had that BfA doesn't.
---
No I mean that someone in T2 could hide how powerful they are. One of the nice things about classic is that you can tell how strong someone is just by looking at them
---
psh, whteva u sai bruh.
---
That’s the biggest reason why I like Vanilla. It had some downsides, sure, but no other expansion or game captures that whole essence of a single world as well as Classic.
---
Meanwhile, crazy hard 5-man content and Naxx-tier raid design is why I like BC the most, and lore/world/also raid design again (minus ToC) is why I also like Wrath.
---
NO ONE CAN SPELL HERE!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I mean all that stuff is great, but the only thing WoW really needs is a dev team willing to listen to it's fanbase.  
---
They're doing that for Classic.  They did it for Legion.  They didn't do it for BfA.  
---
It's unfortunate, but by all internal accounts, the development of WoW is less of a job that Blizzard feels like needs to be done and more of a playground for developers to do whatever they want.    
---
They can't deal with the idea that whats best for the game isn't to just figure things out themselves, but to listen to what the community is telling them.  
---
They only bother paying attention when shit goes wrong, and only for a short while.  Reminds me when I used to let my baby sister play with my phone and she'd eventually accidentally exit the coloring app I had for it.  She'd whine to me, I'd re-open the app, and the second she saw the picture change back to what she wanted she'd yank the thing back out of my hand and continue what she was doing.  
---
That's blizzard except with WoW development.
---
I ground rank 11 pre and rank 9 post xrealm on 2 toons.  Ill take the cross realm any day.  We ended up getting the email of the Marshal grind team on the alliance side and we simplly win traded when ever we ran into thier pre made. We'd roof camp, they' roof camp, and only actually PVPed vs pugs
---
At least with premade vs pugs in cross realm, collusion like this is going to be MUCH more rare.
---
LMFAO
---
Why?    
---
Layering has nothing to do with people not being able to log in
---
Lol, is there anything more cucked than following a streamer around?
---
I got in with less than 1 minute wait just now.  Try again.
---
Right, YOU’RE a dickhead. Thanks for letting me know.
---
They are implementing the Vanilla dream, they're releasing Classic, and though I don't think we're going to see the numbers I'm fairly sure they're going to have more subs in a year as a result.
---
Possibly. I think peoples opinions on things will change massively after 6 months of Classic launch. It’s hard to say exactly how though.
---
She does not exist in vanilla.
---
She was added in TBC.
---
Vanilla has 0 trainers in Kalimdor for Alliance Warlocks I'm afraid. What you'll do is set your Hearthstone on Ironforge and solve it that way. Slower, obviously, but if that's what you're set out to do that's your only real solution. 
---
I'd recommend just doing 1-10 in whatever starting zone you get though (especially Dun Morogh since that'll have the lowest population numbers) unless you really want the Night Elf rep.
---
I've been playing since launch with default a/d keys - you can hold right click to strafe with a/d, the rest is just having nimble fingers
---
I turn with mouse 99% of the time, and use key turning at quest givers and such :p not necessarily for efficiency or anything, it's just what I've become accustomed to
---
I don't understand the numbers in the top portion of your post. Could you explain for those of us who are a little bit slower, please?
---
Does the total XP available, per mob, to be distributed among party members change with party size?
---
Thank you for this, still would love to see a clip of someone trigerring CRP's on the Classic beta while using this addon.
---
Yeah, I totally agree with you, just saying because on those smaller regions the playerbase could be bigger (and Blizzard profits too) if ppl did not have such mentality about subs. Funny how ppl spend more in games like Fortnite and LoL in such regions but WoW sub system is frowned upon.
---
&gt; Got a source? I don't doubt it I am just legitimately interested in any confirmed mechanics for Classic.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Glancing_blow
---
If you scroll to the part where it says "Pre 2.1" it's in there.
---
She doesn't exist in vanilla. She was added in TBC.
---
For what it's worth, that was the best solution I've seen yet! Maybe if lots of endgame areas and whatnot were added into Azeroth at the same time? TBC gear could work there and vice versa? Maybe Naxx gear and such upgrades itself in Outland like heirlooms, and becomes comparable to TBC raid gear?
---
Okay, it's getting out of hand now 😂 I guess the best we can hope for is that, should TBC and WotLK realms ever be announced, there are SO MANY PEOPLE playing Classic that we wouldn't even notice a difference in numbers.
---
Or some Classic Plus servers, with all the stuff they originally had planned for vanilla.
---
Don't the Warlock mounts require mana to cast unlike normal mounts? If it stops regen for a moment then normal epic mount would be better?
---
All of those are entirely possible with a few adjustments to gems and itemization.  I didn't find reforging interesting in the least, much less "awesome," you just got your gear and switched out to whatever stat your spreadsheet said you need.  Almost the exact same concept as gemming, except done through a vendor instead of players (which is arguably the better reason to not use JC: gems would be in insane demand).
---
If any of you are interested in a guild, we'd love to have you! I think we have to offer what you'd want. Current member numbers are low and would love to have you guys right from the start!

Same here. Never reached max in vanilla.
---
The reddit community wowservers are a big help with getting started and what server to choose
---
I mean that's great that you're enjoying it, but you're very much still in the honeymoon period if you only started about 2 months ago.   
---
I think I was enjoying it still myself a month after it launched, and they've improved stuff and added a lot more content.  But there's still a lot of core problems with it.
---
Hi, will your addon support non-English classic wow client?
---
did it end ?
---
I keep getting ganked by this rogue can u invite me to another layer bro
---
Alliance Druids are the one class that gets a trainer outside their area based on lore. Lucky bastards.
---
This will be allowed on classic.
---
What’s that new Will Smith movie? This is the same thing.
---
I'm here because I love Classic. I love everything about it.
---
But the re-made levelling quests in the Cata zones were absolutely fantastic. My fondest memories of levelling were made in Cataclysm. I got to explore a whole new world again. I got to experience "The Day Deathwing Came". Unfortunately that character was the last one I levelled from level 1, and that was the last time I saw that world, because after Cataclysm you never had to go back there.
---
That's what killed it. Not bad quest design, not bad zone design. They made the content and the zones irrelevant outside of levelling, and then in WoD, the final nail, they brought in the boost.
---
Let crit come in partial percentages so it doesn’t have to scale up absurdly. Or keep the maximum where it was and just add base stats to make gear better. Or keep scaling it up and give bosses crit resistance. Or add a crit damage stat to boost the amount of damage cries do when you land one. Or rework critical as a whole to have critical chance just increase the base chance, as it does in path of exile. (If you have a 10% base crust chance, 50% crit increases that to 15%)
---
Literally any of these solutions would work to keep the stat in check without causing your character to become weaker by leveling up, and I just came up with them in about 2 minutes. Pretty sure a billion dollar company with an entire dev team should be capable of coming up with even better ideas with a year long head start.
---
Edit: on mobile, the autocorrect failures shall remain
---
&gt; but you just said previously you didn't like convoluted mechanics?
---
I should have made it more clear, but I wasnt talking about mechanics. My entire comment was talking about Modern WoW's DPS rotations.
---
I'm all for complex raid mechanics, because those can be different for every boss and visually stunning while providing an interesting challenge.
---
But a DPS rotation is going to be boring no matter how many buttons there are because it's always the same priority list of flashing lights and egg timers. So if I'm going to be stuck playing Simon with the lights that pop up on my screen, I want it to take up as little of my attention as possible so I can enjoy the raid mechanics.
---
I usually main a healer because the spells dont feel like an arbitrarily complex busy work minigame intended to distract you from the fight.
---
actually watching streamers
---
Sadness envelopes him. No me though. I make good decisions, Horde decisions.
---
Lmao, best comment I have read here in a while
---
druid has taunt...
---
I'm curious if instead of a cooldown on layer hopping if it triggered a cooldown on gathering abilities so you can't mine or herb for X amount of time. If you kill a mob with more than Y minutes to respawn, it's tagged in other layers and you can't loot it. You could probably still grief hunters by killing Humar the Pridelord or that Elf escort from Northwatch across all layers but people go out of their way to do that already.
---
A cooldown is a simple solution that I think can work, but I think it should be similar to the respec cost cooldown. It starts out at maybe no cooldown, or a 5 minutes cooldown, and each successive layer hop in a certain amount of time increases that cooldown. This way if you just did a quest with a group on Layer 1 and then join a group quest but your group is on Layer 2 you can still join them. But if you want to abuse layer hopping to farm black lotus, thorium, a rare, etc, you'll quickly rack up an hour+ cooldown rendering that ineffective.
---
I dunno. There has to be some solution, though.
---
It honestly just seems to be exactly the same thing renamed
---
How? No one is naming a Blizzard beta that was acting as an advertisement rather than an actual test. I've been in several betas, what are you guys referring to!?
---
It gets annoying when everyone fact checks every little thing but those type of people are the people that will keep Classic authentic. We need people like you so do not mind him.
---
Would he still get credit for the kill if the mob was already tagged before he got invited?
---
I think phase 2 will come in 2-3 months after launch. Many people will only hit 60 by the time.
---
Even if it takes longer or you level faster, I still recommend to save the gold. Epic mount is mostly needed for BGs and farming, BGs won't be out and intensive farming can be postponed.
---
Eh, worth it. I enjoy long road trips in WoW anyway. Or I can make good friends with a mage...
---
The Warhammer mmo that went out of cycle a while back

Don't forget the instantly teleporting everywhere like a cosmic Nightcrawler making that "massive world" feel about as expansive as your living room.
---
Hi, /u/Damianiwins
---
It's the same thing. Servers don't work the way they used to work, so get used to sharding. It can be perfected until bugs like these don't happen, but in the end it will be the same architecture. It's very hard to get right though.
---
Mine was from beta in 04 - 06 and then briefly back a month or 2 for bc and wotlk then gone for good until this August when classic launches
---
Played a mage right?
---

---
See I was a weird outlier in the original vanilla experience, I would happily roam around the world doing random nonsense in my fishing equipment which I would happily stylize to look more like a fisherman and constantly find myself being attacked by everyone for quite awhile.
---
After a Gank or two of me just minding my business I would rez hit a macro that equiped my raiding gear which at thime was a mixture of Teir 2 and Teir 2.5 and that was normally enough to dissuade most people.
---
Every so often on the old WoW server forms someone would post a thread about killing me, making a big deal of it since I was the MT of the 2nd or 3rd most progressed guild on the server and the person posting the thread would get laughed out of existance because I was well known for wearing leather and cloth gear to go mining or Fishing and they knew  that if I was in my proper gear very few people would fuck with me.
---
Yeah i literally saw this yesterday.
---
I'm going to main an Orc hunter, but I have to make my warlock on alliance if I want to troll them with infernals and Doom Guards.
---
/Salute Welcome back, old friend.
---
They actually fixed bugs in betas I've been in as well. Even BfA. Biggest difference for BfA is that there were a lot of bugs, and some of the things people wanted "fixed" were just things they didn't like. I agreed with some of those people, but that doesn't necessarily make a beta not a beta. It just means Blizzard was bull-headed or afraid of changing course on a design direction.
---
40 min queue time opposed to the 2 min max time from last test.  Fine with this as long as I can get in at the end of it lololol
---
The problem is forums have "learned" not to allow people to post names etc of people. So publicly calling people out isn't really going to be a thing anymore. I remember in games of the past that was a thing. I remember in SWG people would call out scammers etc all the time. Post DM's of people being dicks, etc. Simply won't be allowed anymore however.

I'm actually making a raider-classic io mod/website at the moment. It's pretty much done, been alpha testing it on the beta and works flawlessly. 
---
You don't even need to mod installed to be added to the site with your stats and capability, as long as one person I  the group has it, all players in said group will be rated and available to view.
---
I guess if that is what you want, then more power to you. The beauty of the classic experience, I think would be lessened by rushing to 60. But it doesn't matter in the end, play games how you want.
---
Well in retail we've had FoTM specs that are always favored for pushing content.  In classic we won't have that, because we already know the strong specs, there won't be balance changes completely changing the meta or anything so we all know whats strong going in.  But also like in retail, just because you're not a FoTM spec doesn't mean you can't do stuff.  You can succeed in a m+ without an outlaw rogue, who would have thunk it.  Now yes when you are pushing cutting edge stuff you will always seek out the strong specs.  Cutting edge is for like &lt;1% of the players though, and even though it may influence peoples opinion about a spec just play what you enjoy.  As a raid lead in retail I always tell people to play what you find fun.  I know in vanilla that could mean a 30% dps hit but as long as you're not bringing 8 ret pallies and 7 boomkins to a raid i'm sure you'll do fine.

Mob drops 100% xp for a solo kill. Lets say 100xp. 2 man group is 100% still but split between the duo so each player gets 50xp. A three man the mob drops 116.6% xp split between each party member, so 39 xp to each player. And so on.
---
I've been in betas, they were betas. Yes there is usage of content creators for marketing. That happens in every stage of every game. But we are still in there finding bugs, reporting bugs, and bugs get fixed. Not all bugs get fixed of course, some make it through. I remember being highly frustrated by the number of times I fell through the world during Vanilla, or all the times I got stuck because of loot lag. I think folks are just cynical about a new form of both content, and marketing. Yet that marketing is not actually detracting from the beta testing.

Why do so many people on this sub assume everyone is a retailbaby? I would never level a fresh toon in a zone where the nearest trainer is 2 zones away. Once you hit 20ish anywhere is fair game, but if I was leveling in teldrassil and darkshore, warlock and paladin would be a no-go for me.

12. Started Christmas 2005. Only made it to about 52 in vanilla and 66 in BC (didn't play very long in BC). Still remember asking my parents if I could play for half an hour before school if I woke up early enough. I miss adding people to my friends list and seeing everyone slowly progress through the levels and zones.
---
Lvl 5, grab engineering on alt, main bunches up mobs outside of party, alt uses rough grenade to tag them all, main kills them
---
yeah, too quick to click i guess, now i need to wait 5 mins to repost a new "fixed" post,  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWix7PqWq-A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWix7PqWq-A)  there it is if you want it,
---
Fair point, but I'm planning to roll on Rp-PvP or PvP server, since it's classic, I guess I will be forced to fight in many situations in open world, also I really like bg's :(
---
Actually, in Ratchet there are a bunch of Warlock quests.  [This guy](https://vanillawowdb.com/?npc=6251) and [this one](https://vanillawowdb.com/?npc=6266).  I want to say one or both of them are trainers.  I can't recall.
---
too bad that nothing like this happens on servers, you need to stress test the starter zones
---
He's gonna be so mad when they release TBC on classic servers
---
Very cool. I'll add it to my list of options. I'll mostly 5 man and bg, so this could be an awesome option
---
This is a good point.
---
I feel as though this carrot on a stick is used to wake up the manchian candidate who will be forced to mine gold for you.
---
As far as I understand it's only for phase 1.
---
Worth noting that virtually every class has a pretty high skill ceiling especially when Engineering enters the story, but out of those I'd go with (Frost) Mage. They are the most 'lean' in terms of abilities (make sure to bind a rank 1 frostbolt to your bars though), can escape fights pretty well if things aren't looking your way in WPvP and don't have crazy hard counters (Warlocks and SPriests will be rough but you could just not engage and the average player will probably struggle to play those more anyway). Not to mention very strong defensive CDs. They're also great for BGs. 
---
They also level pretty well, besides the mana drinking downtime, and are a great boon in dungeons with plenty of raid spots (and Frost is the way to go for the first couple of phases anyway, for PvE endgame).
---
Get imp and immolate before you leave. Set your hearth in IF and go back at level 8 for more skills
---
https://i.imgur.com/Y5CbjP3.jpg all skills by level
---
If it's going to cause a wipe though, I'm going to tell them... Wipes in Vanilla were much more time consuming than they are for a normal dungeon in *insert expansion here*
---
Anyone know when the regular beta servers supposed to come back up?
---
No, but they considered it, I left before BWL.  My experience with officers cracking down on meter-link drama is from guilds that weren't retarded.
---
It’s against the sub’s rules. Check out r/privateservers!
---
He’s an asswipe but he’s not wrong though
---
I’m on the stress test right now, layering is certainly going wild right now. Lots of lag.
---
Not Vanilla at all. Additionally not only do all your videos show the proper range (which contains no leeway) but also highlight the difference between beta (which does have leeway) and real classic.
---
And as of 1.12/1.13 chock-full of motionless NPCs just looking at each other in silence, they don't walk around, they don't talk, there's no ambiance, no interaction, just there, waiting for the allies to raid the backdoor/sewer/lift and just snag a leader kill like they're going to the store for a soda. So much soul, not like generic Stormwind with it's 6 districts with different styles and themes and it's patrolling NPCs that promote their business, military patrols and that kid selling kittens, Ironforge and it's breathtaking humongous forge and beautiful gates contrasting the cold outside with the hearthy inside and Darnassus with it's serene ambiance and overall calming and retreated environment.
---
Also Undercity is so unique the stores don't even have actual store names.
---
"Oh yes, I'm Robert Rottenballs and I work at \*Leather Armor\*"
---
So yeah, you bet I'm gonna enjoy all three cities that actually feel like safe havens way more than the horde's jamboree-tent-bunch-like capitals, even when I'm planning to alt some forsaken. Maybe, JUST maybe, I'd give you Thunder Bluff &gt; Darnassus. The other two are borderline bs.
---
It’s why I thanked him.
---
But sharding is permanent where as layering is temporary
---
leveled lupos when I was 60. not the best time of my life.
---
I feel the same way about the Kung-Fu Panda bullshit.
---
And when I heard they implemented 'Level-Scaling" I nearly shed a tear.
---
It's like they want the game to die.
---
Then there was Warlords and I thought: Really? Another one? Then not before long, there was "Legion" and it was like: Are they even trying? Why not focus on Warlords? Now Battle for Azeroth. Has anyone really given a shit since they fucked the game up in Cata? Before long, an entire decade had gone by of shitty expansions.
---
But then I heard about Classic and suddenly I cared again. The world became a little less dark that day.
---
When do the regular beta servers come back up?
---
its not that bad since you get most gear from quests, just when you do dungeons together it might be annoying since you will both be rolling on the same gear.
---
Humans end up going to darkshore around level 11 or 12 after entry quests in Westfall and loch modan because everything in those zones turns orange fast, but darkshore has enough to keep yellow quests and occasional orange ones to at least level 16
---
You need to figure out what a percentage increase means.
---
How long did it take the beta servers to be brought back up during the last stress test?
---
My wife (who just announced I was gonna be a daddy) married me knowing I was a WoW fan.
---
Early in our relationship she bought me my first "big" monitor in order to see what I was doing (I was raiding) better.
---
One of our fondest memories is of me raiding and yelling at the tank, "TAUNT CHESTNUTS, TAUNT!!"
---
She still yells this randomly to this day. I will balance my new fatherhood responsibilities, and my duties as a husband, with raising a child. The best thing though, is that she understands how much I love the game, and is even going to roll a character with me when it comes out.
---
A good guild leader is a good mediator
---
Queue time was short during the test window, but the realm was not responding and when it did character creation was crashing.
---
Blizz never fixes shit in beta's, reminder of BfA beta etc (:
---
Sharding relabeled.
---
Damn, I remember seeing this back in the day's. Been re watching a lot of old gem's but I had forgotten all about this one. Thank you for posting this :)
---
alright thanks for the answer. it's nice that it's still live, probably will try it. rip social life
---
its 100% lazy or bad game design, there is a reason nobody plays diablo 3 anymore.
---
Speaking of fury vs arms, I never really understood what the point of that argument was. I tried leveling as arms and fury, and I enjoyed arms a lot more. It just felt more fun to me. Fury was cool, but I felt strange dual-wielding as a warrior, and missed taking huge chunks of HP out with one swing.
---
Hell, even in raids, a decently-geared arms warrior could put up some serious numbers. Maybe not top of the board competitive, but good nonetheless.
---
But yeah, let people play how they want. Just because you think (or know) a 'better' way to play doesn't mean that they care what you think.
---
"Partially they are right"
---
Naw. Bunch of people have put time and money into this game. Classic has no ingame paid services. You gotta charge people to maintain it
---
People feel that lying about playing vanilla gives their opinion legitimacy.
---
im on 5k..43mins see u maybe later
---
We are going to set up groups within the guild to abuse it and farm materials quickly and stockpile it for later, easy money and monopoly.
---
Imagine telling people they are playing a game that's meant to be about the freedom to choose your own adventure and pursuing what they think is fun that they are playing the game wrong.
---
5000 people in que lol
---
found my guild running dungeons. plan to do the same this time.
---
Hi, /u/Xbeverhunterx
---
I didn't say Blizzard betas
---
My friend was like this. I think it was mostly because he didn't have the time to commit to a raiding schedule, but he was the first person I knew to max every class to max.
---
Cant quest cause STV quest givers are full with alliance or horde, or an aoe grinding spot is contested? Just change layers. It is really bad in its current form and it will mess with your experience. They need to figure this out.
---
You're just so much less powerful in Classic. I had maybe 15% dodge (unbuffed) on a fairly well geared Druid tank on a private server. I probably could have had a bit more (I prioritized armor instead of avoidance), but even if I went all out for more dodge, I don't think I would break 20%.
---
In TBC, you have double that amount by the time you're in T5.
---
who cares
---
I quit in '09, just after Wrath dropped. Didn't play again until this past October when my ex convinced me to try it out.
---
The underlying gameplay mechanics were more or less the same, but that was pretty much it. Everything else felt to streamlined and accelerated; I swore I could feel the devs hands on my shoulders, pushing me forward and saying "None of this matters! Just run! Run through all of this so you can get to the real game at 120!"
---
The only way it could have been a worse experience is if they'd taken a page from GW2 and ESO's books and scattered teleporters all over every zone to really make the game world feel as tiny and trivial as possible.
---
Layering does not last until Phase 2. Ion is officially quoted on video saying afew weeks.
---
What are you using for that overlay?
---
Sadly they're only involved in quests, but they don't count as trainers.
---
1. Can be very time consuming
---
2. Depending on your guild as little as 2hrs but realistically 4 ( first raid molten core)
---
3. Fire is fine except in raids because most molten core mobs have high fire resist
---
People love to just repost all the meter threads where after AQ fury wars at the top end are DPS gods. They do pump though. Leveling arms sweeping is a dream though.
---
Was halfway through my 40 minute wait time queue to enter and it just cancelled. Had to start it over.
---
They were already on the same layer.  They could see each other and were fighting the same mob.  It doesn't make sense for either of them to move after forming a party.
---
I feel like it's because all of us Hordies are kind of odd looking and don't take ourselves too seriously (well maybe undead edge-lord does) and Dwarves fit right in. They're a bit weird looking with a funny running animation and a meme worthy face. Love them!
---
I would ride a giant rock at 100% speed before I wait months for some roleplay pony.

You gonna do frostsaber grind while not having epic mount? For your own sanity please don't.
---
im 99% sure yes

Yup. Make yourself valuable!
---
For such an old game there sure are a lot of children being immature over it.
---
I didnt know classic wow attracted so many children.
---
I can't think of a single class or spec that would be easy. I wont lie, I am not great at pvp so I am highly debating playing on pve server for launch
---
The subreddit has decided to hate him for no real reason and people are lemmings.
---
Act a fool.
---
This guy min maxes!
---
Blizzard is actively monitoring the server for analytics reasons for 2 hours. They then leave the server up for 24 hours for people to play it for fun.
---
You don't save that much money from getting the warlock mount and it's just objectively worse due to it costing mana, messing with your mana regen and is affected by curse of tongues.
---
I dunno, if I start in Darnassus at lvl 4 I might miss out on some rep..
---
WRATH sucks, doesn’t deserved to be mentioned with Vanilla and TBC.
---
He's talking about the google search function you idiot. How you managed to create a reddit account is beyond me.
---
Wait a sec, does beta have autoloot feature? 
---
Reason PP macro doesn't rly work in vanilla is due you've to manually loot it, and if you put an attack in, well you won't have time to loot. 
---
So if autoloot is in, then it'll be a nice QoL. Altho not authentic but still.
---
Now
---
My wife isn't a gamer, and wants me to do what makes me happy. I work M-F, and on call Sat and Sunday. Come home, play with the kids for an hour or two, eat dinner with the family, and an hour with my wife solo while the kids watch TV. Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday I workout for about an hour.
---
This leaves me anywhere from 2-4 hours a night to play games, which is very comfortable for me. My wife watches her shows and goes on social media while I play.
---
Edit: also that's pretty shitty of your wife, not gonna sugar coat this shit. My wife couldnt give a flying fuck less about me killing a dragon (she's never played a video game in her life for more than 10 mins), but she wants me to play because she knows I enjoy it. Matter of fact, she's probably more excited for classic than I am, because she hates watching me sit at my desk bored and depressed with nothing to do.
---
 I would seriously think about divorcing her if I were in your situation. It's not something stupid as "for video games", it's serious. This is what makes u fucking happy man. You don't want to live your life like that.
---
I've done a 14, but wasted hours on it in BG queues. This was due to the "frame perfect" rumor that you could do it 100% of the time if you jumped on the correct frame back in vanilla.
---
I know but I cant justify spending 1800g on mounts. I think I might have to do it
---
Every class has it's nuances, but I would say Shaman is probably the most straight forward PvP class. Ele isn't really good until 60 when you can get some spell power on your gear, but a decked out ele shaman is a monster. Similarly, a geared enhancement shaman that gets a windfury proc with some crits can delete players.
---
Someone do a meme of that spongebob moment where he’s like “Wait....  I’m the maniac!” (Instead of maniac, WoW killer)
---
&gt; Layering is to prevent long queue times
---
&gt; 50 minute queue time with layering anyway
---
Seems to be working out great
---
Well I wouldn't use the term retail baby but, If you think fly 2 zones away to get skills is insane. It says at the very least your memory is foggy or you started playing in TBC. Because flying two zones back to your capital is pretty normal. Again though not saying your a baby. I have far stronger memories of TBC then I do of retail classic.
---
&gt; All pets can learn Growl. This is a taunt.
---
Growl is a flat generation of threat like Sunder Armor is. It is not a taunt.
---
Its the same thing regardless if it's temporary or not and whether or not they say it's "different". 
---
Layering makes it where a overpopulated area isn't so populated thus creating another layer.
---
Sharding gives them a reason not to connect realms/give free transfers off of low populated servers. They've added after 100 guilds for each faction clears the current content mythic raid people then can cross realm the raid on mythic; This supports their objective with not connecting realms/giving free transfers off of said servers. Closing servers and or connecting them would make The NA/EU servers that are underpopulated a reason to actually raid without having to move X number of characters to a different server. This wouldn't make blizzard money so they do not do it.
---
Yeah it’s not really a matter of pros and cons, it’s about flavour.
---
Vanilla will ALWAYS have more flavour than retail, but that’s with any game that has changed over time.
---
It's legit. Addons can make it so you automatically equip it every time you get on your mount, then automatically swap back to your normal trinket when you dismount. You should always have it in your bags for that reason.
---
I bet Your... you’re (almost got me again) a blast at parties, huh?
---
How does sword spec proc work when casting whirlwind? Do you get a proc roll for each mob you hit?

Imagine your estimated time without it. Yikes

I just tried to login to see if I had gotten a beta invite, like I do every night. I was super excited and came here to gloat when it said logging into server. I've been bamboozled
---
Oh wow a whole week! Everything should be solved by now clearly! /s
---
I'm just as excited as the next person for classic but this is the actual point of a stress test. They likely invited more people this time around along with the people from last week, because they want to make things run smoothly. This would be scary for actual launch day if we weren't months away from it.
---
"just change layers"
---
have a person on standby who you know is in a different layer and willing/able to invite you to a group? 
---
I wonder who would have that many friends.. hmm.  streamers.
---
case closed, stop watching streaming, kids.
---
You realise this is one server, yes?
---
immolate and imp are level 1

Augh.  Was on for a few minutes at the end of the stress test, logged off to go outside and mow a bit of the lawn quick and take garbage out...now im in a queue to even log in....with a 40 minute timer &gt;_&lt;

Hi, /u/Voops1, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
do you really see a difference with 2 agi (not being catty, just curious) because for me, with the damage ranges of spella and attacks i never really noticed. don't get me wrong, replacing grey vendor trash with mail bracers of the bear feels amazing, but i can never pinpoint that my bracers made my white hit hit for 4 more. weapons are abwhile different story tho
---
1. At ~15 hours a week with casual play, it’ll take you about 4 months to get to level 60.
---
2. Raiding isn’t really the entire purpose of WoW. Back in Vanilla, about 1% of players raided. There’s plenty to do without every caring about raids.
---
3. If you do raid, plan to set aside at about 3 hours in one block. Usually you’ll need to commit to that time every week. You could probably find a guild that does one casual Sunday raid every week.
---
4. Fire mage isn’t the most efficient way to level, but do what you want. Whatever you enjoy is more important. However, in the first two raids (Molten Core and Blackwing Lair), you cannot be fire. The monsters will be immune. After that though, fire becomes the best.
---
Oh you mean like launch when thousands of people will log into the starter zones at the same time?
---
The streamers tested the starter zone. I get the runs don't constantly stress the server but they did provide good data already.
---
We can only hope
---
I'm a bit concerned with you saying you're gonna play solo-PvE. Classic wow is very much a social game and trying to play solo will be frustrating. I would very much suggest against doing it if you've never played WoW before.
---
Classic will suck away as much time as you want to put into it. You'll be able to level and do dungeon content with your listed time commitment pretty easily. Raiding will be more difficult for you. Raids can take a whole day to run if you are repeatedly wiping at encounters. Really though, all the time spent outside the raid, preparing for it, is where the major time sync is. Just the attunement quests to actually be able to raid is a significant time investment.
---
Yes, fire mages are viable in classic. Destruction Warlocks may be worth looking into for you as well.
---
BfA DM = Deadmines.
---
When Dire Maul was end game (all the way up until Cata was released and the dungeon's last boss was changed) Deadmines was referred to as VC and Dire Maul was DM. Simply because there were more people "LFG DM" in trade chat that meant they were looking for Dire Maul.
---
Can tell you never played vanilla because this is how we go to where everyone's hating everything.
---
Guilds is the answer to your question. Not everything is about streamers.
---
This is why i mentioned morrowgrain for the last part of the rep when i do it as an ally. 
---
Morrowgrain is a slow but steady repeatable NE reputation gainer. (still take ages tho) 
---
And well if the cloth turnin will be available from the get go, then that's obviously gonna be much faster, and also helping to gain rep with other factions than just Darnassus/Thunder bluff one. 
---
But i've a feeling they won't be in before the AV patch hits. 
---
Oh also why i hit exalted at 50 in my other post, is due morrowgrain farming a ton at lvl 48-50s to fill out that last part of rep pretty much. Then finishing it off with a quest.
---
so uh, are these servers going to be huge compared to what the original were? my jaw drop when i logged in and got 5000 person que

Taking down Arthas is the most Warcraft shit you can do.

It's not leaving her for video games, it's leaving her for not wanting him to do what makes him happy. Maybe when u get older you'll understand that.
---
Where have they addressed it?
---
100% agree with OP. Streamers are cancerous
---
I still think TBC, besides some obvious errors like Blood Elf Paladins being stronger or... Mace Rogues initially has the best balance of probably any MMO I've ever played (which are a ton). Certainly the most unique balance, as it kept most of the original design ideas of classes from vanilla and expanded upon them rather than doing the dancing chairs number tweaking route they do nowadays. 
---
It's also easily my favourite expansion as a result, plus the added fantastic dungeon content as you've mentioned. Plus Karazhan is probably my favourite raid by far. 
---
The downsides are pretty obvious, namely flying, and some quest zones were designed with flying in mind which ruins that. Additionally, I think arenas had a lot of negative consequences. I like arenas conceptually, I love duels, but adding them before ranked BGs and taking 3v3s as their balance point has brought with it a lot of bad consequences. It could've been done better, that said, the negative consequences of mostly started creeping in at later expansions. Dividing the world up in additional continents is also something I'd rather they never do again (albeit technical issues come into play here). 
---
WOTLK - Eh, I get why a lot of people like it. It was World of Warcraft's most popular time after all (Though IIRC the jump from vanilla to TBC was higher proportionally). The raiding was obviously a highlight, but I couldn't stand how they essentially butchered questing and dungeons which have always been a favourite of mine in vanilla/TBC. All in all, I strongly disliked WOTLK.
---
Seems like your wife doesn't respect your interests.
---
Maybe the next time she does something she enjoys you should remind her it could also be an addiction for stupid people, because that is the lamest response I've ever heard.
---
Honestly if my SO told me I couldn't do something in my free time, we probably wouldn't be together. We both understand the importance of having alone time and having activities. Yes she plays WoW too, but it's pretty much the only game she plays. 
---
I would sit down with your wife and educate her on the bigger issue she is having. You are her husband and the father of her children, and just like her hobbies make her happy, so do yours. If she has an issue with any of your hobbies she should be able to speak her mind. In doing so she needs to recognize that your hobbies, whether she finds them stupid, are your hobbies, and they make you happy. If she can't understand that, then that's the bigger issue, not the hobbies.
---
TBC - Flying
---
Wrath - LFG / LFD
---
Except for the red ribbon arc, drug on way too long, and none of the rr officers were all that compelling. Tien and Piccolo arcs were top notch though
---
Human orc for threat, warlocks or warriors will pull off you in raids once they're geared enough, and more threat you do, more damage they can do
---
Tanking as prot only really matters for undergeared dungeons and raiding, so once your guild (hopefully) gets current content on farm, you can go ahead and spend money to respec to pvp on weekends, and by then people should be geared enough to heal an arms warr 2h taking
---
As for profession, bs has a fear immunity trinket. Otherwise just keep mining for dense Stone/arcane crystals or pick up herbalism for raid mats or pay for alchemy to get more arcanite xmutes.
---
Dickhead also has feelings bro. It's not an easy job to be head of a dick you know

Layering isn't to prevent queue times; it is to prevent player overcrowding in the starting zones.

---
Oh, ok. I'm not that much of a masochist.
---
They shouldn't have layer phased at all. They were already on the same layer. The only way they should have phased is if the invite came from a player on a different layer.
---
&gt; Once everyone catches up you end up with the same number of people competing over the same amount of resources as you would on a normal server. 
---
This makes sense until you think about how people coordinated to control Devilsaur spawns on private servers.
---
You're essentially going to have 5x (or however many shards) as many Black Lotus, Arcane Crystals, Tidal Charms, etc available on each server, so the incentive to control these resources becomes that much more profitable. These will not be distributed evenly across the population. Groups of players will create a guild in each layer to collude and control this surplus of resources. Which means they will have control over the supply and pricing.
---
Why does your wife think you aren't responsible? Did you have a problem in the past prioritizing video games or other possibly addicting activities over your family? I mean is her concern founded?
---
If not, then her remark about your hobby being for "stupid" and "irresponsible" people strikes me as thoughtless and inappropriate. My husband doesn't like videogames and doesn't get how anybody could spend so much time in one sitting playing them, but he understands it's an interest of mine and leaves me to enjoy them in peace. I also prioritize my family, though.
---
I mean it strikes me as odd that you felt the need to *lie* to your wife about how much time this game will occupy. It's weird that you have to lie to her and curry her favor and permission to play a video game. What are the consequences of not securing her official blessing? A marriage is absolutely a two-way street, but the way you're trying to handle this indicates that WoW is the least of your problems.
---
Don't you get reduced rep if you do them past their level though?
---
Yeah that’s about what I thought. Thank you!
---
Making fun of your own stupidity is truly charming. Very original statement by the way...
---
Please get blizzards dick out of your mouth. When it gets fixed we will shut up about it.
---
Just got DC'd. Only had one gold dust to get... ah well I got all day tomorrow.
---
Well, I did. Still no Beta. So...
---
All classes have counters, just play what you think is cool and get good at it you’ll be fine, there’s no 1 single best class!
---
It is what we all hope for. A new beginning that follows the original WoW formula.
---
This is correct.
---
WERE YOU GROUPED WITH LOCKSTAR?!
---
you have to cap the fps in the settings 
---
Thats why your gpu is on fire
---
Nice, I was thinking in such a scenario one could level the warrior each time they have (almost) maxed out rested xp. Rest of the time you can level the warlock. Would make warrior leveling easier:)
---
idk I feel like the point of this stress test is to intentionally fuck it up so you can "play the game" when it really launches ay?
---
I got home from work, got in 40 minute queue. 30 seconds later I'm in my character list. I deleted all my characters and made a new one and now I'm in the game with zero wait time
---
Edit: And I have no lag
---
Blizzard say /sit should NOT proc Reckoning in their not-a-bug list. A streamer shows how he procs Reckoning with /sit, but it's not a brainless sitting but timed. I'm just trying to understand how it's going to work on Classic.
---
1. Well depends what you want to do. The game is fun playing, you don't have to play x amount of hours to have fun. But since you talked about raiding, leveling to 60 takes new players 200+ hours. And then another 100+ for dungeon gearing. So if that's something you want to do, it would take you maybe 5-6 months before you can.
---
2. Depends who is doing them. At the launch of the game there is only two raids, and that takes only a couple of hours once a week. Then dwon the line more raids are added and you want to do them all or as many as possible.  Is raiding mandatory? Not really there's tons of things you can do in the game that is fun that isn't raiding. But with your time schedule I think you can do fine as a more casual raider who is maybe 1 raid behind what is out. 
---
3. Mobbing killing? Do you mean AoE(area of effect, so hits everyone in circle) farming where you line up a big pack of mobs and aoe them down? Anyway yes fire mage works fine while leveling and doing dungeons. The problem is though that fire mage does not work in the first raids. It isn't before zul'gurub that fire mage can even be played in raids, because the first raids have mobs with fire immunity. There is ZG and AQ20 which are 20 man raids that reset every 3 days, they are more casual and you can play fire in there. But for the big raids MC/ony and BWL you can't play fire. And for AQ/naxx well, you need to be a good raider with lots of gear to join, gear that you get from MC/BWL, so you will probably have to play frost for most of your raiding.
---
Got in after trying for over 2 hours, played until level 3. dc'd and now I'm in an 11 min queue with over 2000 ahead of me
---
Buy a regular epic mount, they are superior.
---
Warlock mounts cost mana and delay your mana regen. You also cannot summon it if you are silenced or bashed. If you plan on doing any PvP then you gimp yourself by using the quest mount.
---
on top of that you only save a few hundred gold by getting the quest mount, it's not "free" like everyone memes
---
They fucked up.
---
They didn't want better items pushing eventually pushing crits, dodge etc to 100%
---
But that's actually fine. Crits become normal damage, and then you can begin introducing Fatal%, or whatever. Double crits essentially. You mitigate dodge chance with ever creeping hit chance or whatever. That makes more sense than the stupid rating system that was incomprehensible with weird scaling.
---
Elwyn forest is super overcrowded right now (or was a few minutes ago).  Avoid. Hard to get quest mobs.   
---
For me at least queues are less than 5 minutes and less than 1600 person queues.  Probably changes a lot though.
---
Yeah they do this when the server goes down for any significant period of time. 
---
Last time they did a stress test they told us they were wiping all characters.
---
Lets grind this &amp;$#@ out!
---
Wrath PvP was awesome. My favorite metas and PvP season and I wasn't a dk
---
Yeah I didn’t even really notice it was unchecked in the settings. Derp
---
It seems to be working now, but those look like they’re only gameplay related icons.
---
I need the icons/images from the UI elements. Like, the little things, like Blizzard’s in-game WoW scroll bars, arrows, etc.
---
If aliens came to earth it'll be like the same thing. Why work hard when you can get carried. Aliens strip earth of resources and move on. We'll be left with shambles. Human nature
---
If this doesn't sum up Vanilla players I don't know what would.
---
I think if subscriptions were Blizzard's only form of revenue, then they would have gone this route. Or something close to it.
---
They made the expansions the way that they did for the box sales. They had tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue on the table every time they released an expansion. They really had no choice but to do it that way for the sake of their business.
---
Those expansion-style releases won't be an option for future content in Classic. I think that's a good thing for the game.
---
MSI afterburner and Riva Statistics Tuner
---
I'm in but there is literally no one in Orgrimmar
---
&gt;In my opinion: BC ?= MoP &gt; Vanilla &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cata &gt;= WotLK &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Legion/WoD/etc
---
I wasn't really counting Vanilla as an expansion, since it is really just a standalone game IMO (though, I understand it is a version, so I get it), but my list would go:
---
WotLK &gt; MOP/BC &gt;&gt; Cata &gt;&gt; Legion &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WOD/BFA
---
&gt;Cata actually had a LOT of good raids (especially Firelands, which is probably #4 overall).
---
I played a lot in Cata so I have a strong opinion on it; and basically, the raids were shitty after the first tier. The first tier was great (I loved Sinestra as a healer - or more like, loved to hate lol), but after that, it was aweful. Firelands was half a tier, only having 7 bosses. Originally, they planned on having a Vash'ir raid alongside the Firelands tier, but it was scrapped. That would have put the tier at over 10 bosses and actually decent. And balance was fucking awful. You know how easy the first 6 bosses were before H Rag? My guild cleared the first 6 bosses within the first 3 weeks of heroic mode, then spent the rest of the tier pulling Rag.
---
Then you have DS, which was a complete shit show. Balance was also terrible, all the textures except Deathwing were rehashes, all the mechanics were rehashing, and the last boss was easier than the one before it. My guild spent a month progressing on spine, then downed 8/8 H the same week.
---
But IMO, the first tier was one of the best raid tiers I have ever played. Just the amount of raids, new mechanics, and different ways to progress. One of the things about the first MoP tier I didn't like was the gating; it gave you an exact progression plan to push through. Rather than jump raid to raid to try progressing on different heroic bosses, guilds would just push through MSV before HOF or TOES was even out.
---
Also, I thing I personally loved about Cata was the changes they made to healing. I main a healer, so the end of WotLK was literally just Holy Light or Chain Heal spam through raids. The way Cata adjusted healing made it so each healing spell choice mattered.
---
But I digress lol. Overall, I would say that most people are going to judge each expansion based on their individual set of criteria. Some people really like 5 man content, so their view of the best expansion is based on that; some people really like raiding, so their view of the best expansion is based on that; etc.
---
Spot the summer child.
---
I'll throw the Rogue hat in the ring.  Between having stealth to avoid any fights you don't want, being a solo play style class so you don't have to worry so much about what everyone else is doing, and with a couple macros you could probably play it with an xbox controller... it's definitely beginner friendly.
---
You have the option to win 100% of your fights if you're patient enough.
---
Before someone blows a gasket and links me perplexity videos, Rogue his a high skill ceiling.  But, you can play Rogue with 4 buttons and click a couple cooldowns and win half your fights if you take proper advantage of stealth.
---
No problem at all, at the end of the day, you should play something you enjoy. If appearances get in the way of your enjoyment, then you should find a class you enjoy more.
---
I completely understand, I can't play orc or troll hunters despite tauren being the objectively worse hunter race.
---
Do abilities proc it if you are sitting? There's quite a few talents that interact with physical hits. Warriors, priests, and shaman all have ones that also trigger something.
---
I highly suspect they plan to keep the engine as updated as possible. I may not be the 8.1 engine yet, may not be for launch, but I suspect it will at some point in the near future. All guesses tho
---
B-but there are literally dozens of us!  Dozens Mon!
---
Atleast I’m not a dickhead, dickhead.
---
u dumb?
---
Who?
---
Whirlwind is counted as a single attack for the purposes of sword specialisation.
---
It's worth noting by the way that Sword spec procs reset your swing timer. Meaning occasionally they can actually reduce your DPS if you get a proc off a yellow ability just before your swing was about to land.
---
Also worth noting that all sword procs are white damage. Which is important because white damage works off one roll, and yellow damage works off two rolls.
---
Layering should simply not exist.
---
There's no evidence that the game will die in 6 months. Nostalrius' population rose pretty consistently until it shut down. Another well known private server launched almost a year ago and they currently have about 12k concurrent players - more than they launched with.
---
Even if you expect 50% of the playerbase to quit in half a year, if you cap server pops at 6000 then you end up with 3000 consistent players, which is similar to vanilla population caps.
---
Ermagherrd, the nostalgia... i hope the servers will survive the masses of people coming back to play,,,,
---
Yeah that's what I'm hung up on. Why does she think he's irresponsible? Is a videogame what he really needs, or is it marriage counseling?
---
Probably one of the few one point wonders, that and improved shield block for warriors.
---
My phone does that shit in my pocket. I will hear people faintly talking and Ill be like, I know that voice?  Sometimes takes me many a minute to figure out what is going on, lol
---
That was EXATLY what hapened with me when i started playing in cataclysm. I started doing quests and sht and was having a blast, till i find out about the dungeon finder, now if i wanted to do quest id have to spend most of my time changing zones cus the quests would get outdated so fast with dungeon finder. It was really bad =/
---
I had a big awesome world to play on, but 99% of that was useless and didnt worth the time, so i just stick with dungeon finder. Ended up doing pvp, arenas, thats pretty nice, but i really miss a real MMORPG.
---
About ESO, their expansion system is good, but the game world is too easy ( u do most of world stuf alone, and one shot everything after getting a bit more geared, raids and vet dungeons are hard tho) and the weapon system too non-immersive. When u are like a stealth archer but have to get a big 2handed axe, do a shout to buf urself and than shoot from stealth, it kills any immersion. those are the 2 reasons i quit ESO.
---
Improved Rend
---
I honestly think it would, even if people don't realize it, so long as it comes with a challenge. Quick and easy isn't fun in the long run.
---
None of them retain their abilities when tamed in 1.12.
---
Since we are getting 1.12, the following will be true:
---
* No pets will keep their resistances when tamed (Snarler did until a pre-1.12 patch)
---
* No pets will keep their movement speed when tamed (AV wolves and Takk the Leaper used to go extremely fast, as fast as 100% mounts)
---
* No pets will keep their unique ability to deal non-physical damage with basic attacks (Lupos used to deal shadow damage with his basic attacks)
---
Pets will have the following to differentiate themselves:
---
* Their attack speed. Pets retain their attack speed after being tamed. Faster attacking pets are better in PVP as they do more pushback to casters.
---
* Their armor, health and damage stats will differ depending on their family. [Hunter pet compendium](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GpZTeJa5QIc-x_2LlBhwinNzZI_g-Ib38mJYNRh8t3E/edit#gid=1902096707)
---
As a final note, make sure not to tame [caster pets](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/casterpets.php). They have worse stats than regular pets.
---
I've never liked scaling. When mobs change their power depending on your power, and worse yet, only change for you and may appear of different power to other people in your group, it makes the world feel arbitrary and artificial. It plainly exposes the cogs in a system and ruins any sense of immersion derived from having a consistent world.
---
I think it's a horrible system for any sort of RPG. I disliked it in Oblivion, disliked it in ESO and I still dislike it in WOW.
---
Valkurm Dunes Gang
---
The only one i found that scratched the itch was allods, but the devs just let it die :(
---
/sit SHOULD force crit.
---
The force crit from /sit SHOULD NOT proc special effects like Reckoning or Enrage, according to not-a-bug list.
---
Now, what about timed spellbatched /sit..? Also, does it differ in PvE and PvP?
---
I don't really think it was a matter of \*unfinished\* classes, more like different philosophies.  
---
Classes in TBC were starting to be designed around their actual gameplay, along with WotLK. Later on in Cata they started basing the design around mandatory rotations and everything became more self-contained.
---
For example, mid WotLK (I think around 3.1) Blizzard decided to give ret pallies the ability to use Exorcism on anything, a proc to make it instant and a replenishment proc for mana. Did the class/spec really scream exorcising random critters and being mana-fountains? Not really, but it was done for the sake of gameplay. By the end of the expansion talent trees had become pretty streamlined and rotations became pretty clear-cut and to the point. As mentioned above Cata came and left us with just our spec's rotations, no flavor allowed!
---
Vanilla had a totally different approach to class design (abilities and talents specifically). They added what seemed to go with the flavor of the spec, it didn't matter that so much stuff was borderline useless, if you grabbed, say, Survival stuff, you better believe there was gonna be some boy-scout shit in there; Are you gonna use it? Probably not, but it fit and they're happy with that. Going back to paladins they even realised, coming from the beta where they had a good couple of 'strikes' and physical attacks that Warcraft's paladins were more of a blessed, armored spellcaster rather than just a holy warrior, so they made them fully spell based (like their WC3 counterparts) for the time vanilla released.  
---
It was a matter of gameplay vs immersion/flavor. An example of the opposite would be MoP, where everyone had everything because gameplay and every damn class felt the same, you just chose them for their theme and/or performance in charts.
---
Unless it's implemented that way to circumvent some specific exploits.
---
Yes gnome is definitely the best for mage/warlock. WoTF for warlock is pretty impactful in 1v1's for sure, though you really don't rely that much on fears as a warlock that people have you believe.
---
Hunter does not struggle versus melee, they do fine. Warlocks and spriest can be tough. But they are mostly all skip matchups based on how good you are at kiting and keeping them just out of range.
---
Warrior definitely is the weakest 1v1 class, so maybe not fitting for you
---
Rogue you do have to deal with the stun resist, but it's not that huge. Orc warriors you should win against, rogues usually play undead anyway, shaman is fine to fight, and hopefully people will pick undead warlock :D
---
Spriest I mean depends how much you want to pve? You can't get harassed to heal if you are pvping.
---
ret paladin definitely sucks
---
Druid is a interesting 1v1 pvper, they are very strong, but underrated and underplayed, because the playstyle is slowly wearing down the opponents while outsustaining.
---
Do addons not work for the ST server? I'm trying to use the Questies beta version so I can look at the zone quests, but it's giving me lua errors.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I don't think Classic will kill Retail. It'll have a bubble, the bubble will pop, and two games will coexist beside each other. I think outside of that initial bubble period, retail will be vastly more popular and played than Classic.
---
From Blizzards point of view, Classic was more than likely just an insurance policy they put in place to slow subloss in between expansions. Which is probably when these servers would boom.
---
If Blizzard were really smart they'd start having fun, unique server variants go live during these times as well, but I'll hold my breath on that.
---
This. You might be dot shield wanding very early on or on the occasional pull where you need to regen some extra Mana. Stack a lot of spirit and front load your spells so you're in the 5 sec rule when the mob dies.
---
but diablo(2) was always about that  
---
leaderboards are basically speed run contest, who gets the highest level faster
---
Lol, why downvoting though? Hahaha, you feel me
---
And I am genuinely disappointed I wont be able to collect their tiny alcohol ridden spines in AV.
---
Yea exactly what you and /u/KungFuher said.
---
I lol’d
---
As far as I know it's been years since Blizzard/Activision has made playerbase numbers public, but the leader boards for seasons populate almost instantaneously when seasons begin..so people definitely still play.
---
I personally am going to roll a tauren for the stun and being able to fake cast hearthstone to bait out interrupts. But the orc stun resistance is also nice
---
Whatever dude, I just hope you now understand how to use google to find the things you need. I just wanted to help, you know.
---
You said "Tips" you get downvoted. Not by me mind you but people are haters
---
Nope. After the dimension warp, nothing that happens on the other layer matters.
---
Do you have a source on that?
---
It’s fixed
---
I'll agree to that.
---
Even back in TBC, when I got my first T6 gear even the Horde knew it (i was alliance)
---
I got whispers and messages on the forums congratulating me from horde players who had faced me in world pvp and BGs and recognized me.
---
It's because they are testing new limits. They can invite what they know the server can handle, but they're stress testing it. They want to overload it, hence the 'stress test', and see what happens and what they can do to improve when the system is overloaded. That's what this is for...its not the beta. It's to overwhelm the servers
---
Gotta get them views to smash that twitch prime with my leet ass controversial opinion that LaYeRiNg SuCkS aSs!!!
---
So basically hunters can handle most classes 1v1? And if i went spriest wouldnt i have to pve to get gear anyway
---
a well played druid is unbeatable, its the most rewarding class by mastering.
---
Yarr.  Can't stand orcs.  I wish female tauren had better models or i'd be into that.  
---
Thanks for being courteous, everyone else in the thread is blasting me for my opinion lol
---
It’s almost like having a community of people to talk to and discuss content you enjoy together is a waste of time, right?  Don’t act like your so innocent, you did it to prove a point. I came away thinking you’re a dickhead.
---
I'm a little disappointed Trolls/Horde never got the Headhunter class. A ranged /hexing non-pet based class.  Let Alliance and Nelves keep druids, give us the head hunter.
---
A prot warr with thunderfury or another spectacularly good 1hander can definitely get in on some good wpvp. 
---
You dunk on melee 1v2 is np, and you have a fighting chance against casters. It’s only healers that will destroy you in pvp. 
---
But this is with good gear. A mixture of block value and crit. If you try and pvp with a bunch of pre-raid defence gear you will be a potato.
---
I played a gnome warrior since 2005 and never played any other classes past level 20 or so. I don't play retail anymore because the class is too different now. I don't want new things, I want more of exactly what I did before. I didn't stop playing because I got bored, I stopped playing because too many things changed. I'm only in my early 30's but am already too old to want to learn new video games... Just want to do the same content and the same class forever. Give me that sweet charge &gt; mortal strike &gt; execute gameplay.
---
Legion was trash. Lets take the shit titanforging system from WoD and turn it up to 11. Lets force you to endlessly do trivial, repetitive dailies so you can up your chance at getting your BiS from 0.001% to 0.005%. From random mobs and quests mind you, almost never from actual endgame activities.
---
And instead of tuning endgame content to be difficult, we're just gonna continue throwing in 20 difficulties so that even a 20iq Neanderthal will see all the content. Oh and a speedrun timer, because that totally isn't cancer for MMO pug gameplay.
---
Also let's completely destroy PVP for the nth expansion in a row, it wasn't quite dead enough yet.
---
Deadmines was super simple. What game are you people playing?
---
Uhhhhh no, trinkets aren’t piercings, they’re just items you carry around that for game purposes you can equip. 
---
If they were piercings, things like the the Darkmoon Cards, Gnomish Death Ray or  Linken’s Boomerang wouldn’t make a lot of sense.
---
Recount works for me, but not the vendor one. I searched specifically for Classic ones earlier (not vanilla, but the ones updated to this beta).
---
Doesn’t support it now. Likely won’t at launch. No reason to suspect Blizzard has any intention of keeping the client updated beyond “it works”.
---
For me its ne hunter&gt;human(because they play human in a fantasy game LOL)&gt;gnomes&gt;dwarfs
---
It's hard to nail down a specific build that you "typically" go. Even for a specialized purpose like flagrunning there is some variance. I would run one spec in a group that I felt I could rely on to peel, and a different one for more random teammates. Generally the main points to hit are feral charge, nature's swiftness, and nature's grasp. Build the rest of the points around your specific needs.
---
Thank God
---
It’s much, much cheaper.
---
Confirmed pet attack speeds are in the game. DPS is normalised but you can have a fast pet👍
---
To be fair, a lot of that is idling in Cata and MoP. Left my PC running quite a lot during those days.
---
But yeah, it is a lot.
---
They DO work. I'm using the pfUI and pfQuest from  [https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/) and it works. Playing right now.
---
Marry me
---
&gt;Warlock - was my next bet but i would have to be gnome again, and arent ally locks effected by wotf or some horde racial?
---
There is also shamans with tremor totem but luckily undead can't be shamans. Undead warriors can be a headache though.
---
&gt;Hunter - seems cool but from what i understand they struggle against melee AND certian casters like lock/spriest? Seems like it has to many counters &amp; drops off when other classes get geared?
---
I believe only SL/Ruin locks give Hunter's trouble but otherwise it's a pretty favorable matchup. Don't quote me though. Hunters can be a nightmare for casters due to spell pushback.
---
I think it ultimately it depends what kind of playstyle you're looking for. No class is unanswered in PvP (though the strongest 1v1 would probably be an Undead Spriest). Destro Warlocks easily have the highest skill ceiling and largest array of tools, but a mage's toolkit is much more concise.
---
Why isn't this on the top. You should have no trust in Activision!!
---
He was moving, your point is therefore invalid.  
---
Bonus point: Deserter debuff lol
---
I'm almost positive that only applies to experience.
---
You have to be like +5 levels or something. So being level 4 on the starter quests you'll still get max xp. At most you'll lose a bit but it won't be a crazy amount... Nothing that a few stacks of cloth to the rep dude can't fix later.
---
Wrong. They said in a Tipsout interview that they are looking into giving layer priority to the same guild members. If you are sure guilds are always in the same layer now , provide proof.
---
Even if they implement guild prio , whats stopping guilds making alts in another guild to abuse the feature? Yeah its tryhard but it will happen. If you guys wanna be in a disadvantage, be my guest.
---
BWL was a proper expansion
---
ZG was a proper expansion
---
AQ was a proper expansion
---
New content without invalidating old, or trivializing the road up to it. There's no reason they couldn't have done similar alongside new levels, but they did.
---
The wanted BC to effectively be a hard reset on gear and progress, so everyone could experience the new content and equal terms. And that made those two fatal flaws, it invalidated old items and trivialized the path leading up to 'the new content'
---
Fuck me. Reddit amazes me. I was like yea awesome idea but who the hell would they even use... Like these choices are better than the originals (night elf mohawk excluded obviously)
---
&gt;False. ~~Wildstar~~ Warhammer is the WoW killer.
---
Need to test the milk before I buy the cow
---
I don't see why splitting the player base is ever a thing. I'd be willing to bet there will be more than one "blizzlike" pserver spinning up a few months after Naxx to catch all those people who liked Vanilla but loved TBC. People are going to leave Classic regardless of it either gettimg stale or preferring another x-pac. Blizzard should do the smart thing and keep them subbed with TBC/Wrath.
---
Why are you responding when he asked someone else?
---
It was all good until you got to Trall forever warchief. That piece of debris cheated in an honor duel to kill the greatest war chief the horde has ever known. Garrosh died and the horde wept.
---
Ion talked about it in a few of the streamer interviews at Blizzard HQ that took place a few weeks back
---
That's fine, internet words don't hurt me. Being self-sufficient is a blessing though.
---
I disagree about WotLK 5-man content being easy. Some of those Heroic challenges for the mount were hard as fuck and really fun to bash your head against.
---
Hey I understand the pain! If I take the gear damage it happens but I had a FD/strip macro specifically for this 😂😂😂
---
You're overthinking it, and there's no such thing as perfect race/class combo. You're going to die...a lot, and the more you acknowledge the faults the class you choose has the better you'll get. Eventually you'll be good enough to kill classes that were meant to counter you, and even then you'll still end up dying from time to time.
---
TLDR: Play whatever you find most fun.
---
&gt;I don't have to farm anything, talk to anyone, read any guides, join any guild. 
---
You didn't have to do that in Vanilla either if all you wanted to do was hit 60. This is just a bad comparison you are choosing to not do things that require all of these things and then complaining that the thing you chose to do did not require you to do them.
---
I don't think your idea of difficulty fits what most people are thinking of either. I think when people say something is difficult they mean that your performance and the decisions you make in the moment will affect your result. And the more precise you need to be, the more difficult something is.
---
And the videos that people are reacting to are not the ones where a group of 30's smashes through SFK, it's where a level 20 group breezes through the dungeon at appropriate level and has not problems at all that caused people to speculate the elites are under tuned.
---
I don't think anyone was fooling themselves into thinking Vanilla had hard mechanics, but I think many people thought the tuning was much tighter then it actually is. As it turns out when your average players today research what the best spec, best stats, etc. are for their class, the content is just a lot easier.
---
Pretty sure 9 in a banable offence
---
All of this would be far superior to adding new ilvls. I personally don't think any new content should surpass Naxx ilvl, and should instead try to fill niches (like odd specs), add alternative leveling/quest hubs, dungeons in different level brackets, etc, with layouts and rewards similar to other options in their range.
---
If you all pull up the who list what classes do you see the most/ least of?
---
Those were the days
---
Rogue will be the easiest because you can hide, but even then if you don't know how to play your class you'll get stomped. Then you'll think rogues are "broken."
---
The 5 second rule applies to class mounts yeah.
---
I couldn't imagine taking the game so seriously that I wouldn't ride my awesome class mount because of that.  I'm sure someone does though.
---
Might as well. There's a whole new meta on how to cheat &amp; abuse the game with layering. Nobody is seeing how bad it is. It literally will ruin the entire game.
---
BWL, ZG, AQ
---
WOW did this too. New content without invalidating old. when BC released, it was new content with a purposeful hard reset on accumulated power so everyone could experience the new content on more equal ground. 
---
Classic had 'catchup' gear, but that gear didn't compoletely outshine what you were getting in MC and BWL, only making it so you could more easily get into and experience ZG, for example. Imagine if T0 gear had better stats than T2, and was green.
---
BC could have been no different than the various dungeon releases if they reigned in the power creep, or made a lot of the content require at least 5-man blue level gear to be effective in outlands so previous content progression wasn't immediately invalidated. But they didn't. And so instead of running Scholo so you could survive in outlands on your alt, you just rushed to 60 and straight in because none of that old lvl60 content mattered anymore.
---
BWL didn't invalidate MC
---
Also, for anyone worried if boomkin is viable, this pic should give you hope.
---
Hunter counters rogue. Why would you die? 
---
Assuming he has the opener, Scatter as soon as you get out of stun. Feint death into icetrap. Build distance with cheeta. Keep him at distance while kiting with concussive/scatter shot/grenade and keep him from restealthing with hunters mark/serpent sting
---
Profit
---
Unpopular opinion, yes

Goldshire tavern, 2nd table on your right
---
In stress test right now as of May 29th Benedict’s Chest in the kul tiras castle in durotar doesn’t de spawn after use. Unsure if it’s intended or not

Scaling is terrible in BfA when leveling. You actually feel like you get much weaker while the same enemies get stronger when you level up which feels awful.
---
I have faced you plenty of times in WSG and AB / I was a gnome rogue named Fearz. I still mention Grovestreet till this day due to having the most epic battles in Bg's and WPVP. 
---
I later then joined &lt;War Front&gt;
---
Good for you, I’m glad you don’t enjoy talking to people.
---
Definitely functions on the stress test.
---
That's the way it was in 1.12, which is the patch version Classic is based on.
---
I'm disappointed by it, but there are pragmatic reasons for going this route instead of actual patch rollouts or more closely emulating them than the content buckets do. Maybe if Classic is successful enough they can justify the cost of tweaking it for increased authenticity by including debuff slots, itemization limits, and some other major changes into the content buckets in the future.
---
fight
---
If that fails walk back and rez.
---
If they're camping me and I don't think I can beat them I'll just go play an alt.
---
Told my wife about it and how I took a week off work when it launches. All she said is "does that mean were ordering alot of take out then?"
---
She cant cook so I do the cooking usually. She knows me all too well. She even has a big bean bag chair in my gaming room which she can read in as i game. 
---
Find a woman you can be your true self with.
---
Never seen this one, great stuff! Had a few genuine chuckles :) The country style really makes it.
---
Layering should not exist in any capacity whatsoever past level 10 change my mind
---
This here
---
It's like 520g instead of 800, it's not that cheap
---
On the one hand, the vast array of tricks druids have make them appealing, on the other, it seems like their playstyle in any 1 form is extremely limited.  Like comparing a prot warrior to a bear, the bear seems like it has two abilities.
---
You posted twice of the same thing and know nothing of what layering is suppose to do.
---
Much appreciated..I assume paladin or mage would be best?
