4-6 months per phase.

---
They can't use engineering items and pots. They can use on use abilites on gear. Again, stop spreading misinformation.
---
As someone who will PVP and probably not raid a lot, this will give me an advantage over raiders, bastards
---
Maybe. There would be a lot more backlash now; especially considering the amount of people watching streams.
---
Roll a Hunter or Warlock. Their pve raid spec works excellently in pvp.

The mountains of Ironforge are grand.
---
Awesome !!!. Would love to see a orc rogue in full bloodfang 😉
---
honestly a lot of people here hate TBC for taking WoW outside of Azeroth, and i think the Emerald Dream would have about the same effect on the classic community, maybe even more so due to how desired of an addition it is.
---
Someone died, so their guild organized an in-game funeral to remember them and commiserate with each other.
---

---
A separate group decided it would be *hilarious* to show up and kill everyone. The picture is one of them sending a chat message right before they start PVPing.
---
My idea?
---
Bro, if you actually find some who unironically expects that, please let me know.
---
And if you do find them, just don't group with them or worry about their mentallity or whatever else.
---
Let people enjoy the game however the fuck they want to...
---
As compared to your unparalleled maturity, assasshehhe.
---
I'm not looking forward to the various pretenders to the throne who are seeking to be the next legendary ganker like Angwe.
---
Bro the first one is beyond epic
---
Hunters hands down. Warlocks don't really use their early tiers and have to fight for offpieces with all the other casters. Restos have a lot of other restos to compete with + all the other healers on offpieces. Hunters get free tiers and weapon upgrades until they have to compete with other classes on the T3 tokens. Only the neck/cloak/ring/trinkets could be contested by other classes, but those items are usually either hunter prio or melee prio, and you'll get the former ones pretty easily.
---
Raids, not dungeons.
---
Absolutely a waste if my serious concern is not a valid one though.
---
Fucking timeless.  Still hilarious.
---
Looking at the player behind the gear is more valuable than what gear they're wearing.
---
Banned for what thou?
---
*scatman intensifies*
---
&gt; group buffs dont apply to them 
---
I'm pretty sure that would be only paladin blessings, and that's because greater pally blessings buff every player of X class in the raid.
---
&gt; World buffs, as far as I remember dont work (and dont on pservers either).
---
They do on pservers and afaik they did in vanilla as well.
---
Well we ***are*** waiting.
---
People just want BiS. BiS girlfriend, BiS car, BiS house.
---
The (actual) problem with early Cata dungeons was the mana nerf, and most people seem to forget about this thing. In wotlk no healer ever ran out of mana, while at the start of Cata, you would go oom after the first trash pack.
---
I don't give a damn about those, the best part about female dwarves is that their hair spins around when they're casting heals.

I think targeted harassment of streamers by anti-fanboys is going to be much more common.

I saw that a few years ago, I wonder if still true.
---
The kid on the left with the red hat always cracks me up
---
I kind of hate you...but only a little.
---
No prob! Like I said, not sure if the Classic server is going to be like ... RAW RAW, day 1 shit. Haven't looked into it since I'm not going to play lol.
---
Druid: We have our own peaceful nature area that basically no one else goes to. Also there's tons of Cenarion Circle stuff going on in the world and it's basically the druid group. Plus: can be cat, bear.
---
Shaman:  Yeah I guess I can purify corrupted water and shit if I feel like it. But mostly I'm gonna zap shit with lightning and talk to my great grandpa's spirit.
---
Hunter: I get to live among the wild creatures but not really in harmony like the other two. I'm just trying to stay alive and kill shit.

How on earth is gnome easier for horde? It's literally right out front ironforge. Wait deadmines too? Thats super easy for alliance. Are you trolling?
---
Aren't you taking this a bit to personally ?
---
Well, the thing is that us veterans aren’t going to stay around for long. I’ll be a glorified casual and maybe last for a year or two, but it’ll be the new players that keep the population base going.
---
I hope that they’ll like it. I let my 12 year old nephew play on a private server for classic and he got addicted. He’s into every new game known to man, he explained it as a game that he had never played before. Yeah, it’ll be dated for sure.

Oh, is naxx going to get overshadowed again by TBC launching a couple months later? Or is your delusion a different variety
---
Hunter!!! You get a pet and you get to find and tame rare pets! So fun!

But tauren are a cow

Human Warrior, Tank, LF late night oceanic guild or morning US guild. PST
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I was originally planning to create my own guild but I have started my own business and that will come first so I am looking for a more relaxed position as guild off-tank.
---
looking for a semi-hardcore guild who intends to clear naxx. Late night AUS time would be good.
---
Lmao mf's die everyday b
---
Yeah, but if a guild is inviting people they will always pick the people who dedicate their time to getting the best possible gear. If your guild has a loot council you better believe the guy/gal who farmed pre-bis, bis etc will be getting the items first. 
---
Just like there are guilds that bring balance druids and ret paladins to raids there will be social guilds that don't care about bis. I myself have always liked the checking boxes approach to gearing up. Getting the best enchants on a bis item feels amazing. If you don't that's fine, you can still raid. But i remember looking up bis items both in vanilla and in TBC because you didn't wanna waste your cash on a crusader/mongoose enchant on a weapon that was not the best weapon possible.
---
Those were brutal to heal. Especially since Priest healing had just got an overhaul. Loved Cataclysm.
---
I don't know about you but generally "a full circle of ungoro" doesn't involve a quick hip over to Winter springs for me
---
&gt;Drillborer has REFLECT, while Skullflame has PROC when hit
---
I think there is some kind of misunderstanding... Classic DB says for Drillborer:
---
"Equip: When struck in combat inflicts 3 Arcane damage to the attacker)
---
No mention of any reflect?
---
Weak auras and I'll be happy. elvui would be great but might be a stretch, otherwise any decent actionbar add-on for me
---
Sure, but in 2.0 you could just buy the vanilla epic PvP gear at 60 for rather cheap. Everyone was PvPing like mad because the rewards were insane.
---
Asking for that honor system in Classic is basically asking them to completely reinvent PvP itemization to be more like TBC, which had multiple tiers of gear dedicated to that purpose.
---
I mean it's not bad but it's not nearly as cool as the other vanilla legendaries.
---
NOCHANGES HURR DURR

Death knight
---
Ruining other people enjoyment of the game? ‘Griefing’ 
---
It was a funeral put on for an alliance player who died irl. It was raised by a horde guild and the funeral was yanked. There was a lot of outrage at the time in ~2006 and online games are much more mainstream now a days.
---
There was a huge backlash at the time but in the end: they chose to do it in Winterfall instead of, say, Nagrand or Durotar. They should have seen it coming. 
---
Hell; I am one of the nine people still playing Red Dead Online and whenever my discord does an event we still have a couple players run security so people don't fuck with us.
---
I lol’d. Good stuff
---
Retailers are supposed to be nice after all.
---
Makes your spells activate on key press instead of key release.
---
I think the age range here on reddit is very skewed. Definitely on my EU server most people we in their early 20’s. Of course, maybe they were all 8 and lying which would explain a lot come to think of it, lol.
---
a full circle of un'goro means completing every quest found there
---
just so you know
---
definitely did, check out them dungarees son.
---
You can tank feral dps or heal effectively. You will do everything in pvp
---
He literally mentioned Shadow Priests and Feral/Moonkin Druids.
---
you mean the most bad ass lion whose mouth could fit your worgs/kodos/raptors head easily? in a read battle those things would be killing machines and a terrifying sight to see packs of them
---
Yah but if you role on a pvp server. That's part of the game. I dont think blizzard could do anything for doing exactly what the server type is intended for.
---
For instance. I get ganked while leveling it whatever. The player that ganked me might get banned? It's silly and would cause more of an uproar if they banned people FOR PLAYING THE GAME lolol
---
"Patch 1.12 added cross-realm Battlegrounds"

Chimera Shot

---

Yup class leaders is the way to go. Class leaders keep track of their people while you manage the class leaders. Gear score doesn’t work because there’s blue items that are bis till AQ/Naxx. 
---
Also, MC is not a big deal. You don’t need much gear for it. The top guilds will clear MC in green leveling gear.
---
Alright jackass, and how many of the millions of kids playing the game do you think had more 2 epics? It's a below average raid drop, not unwieldable dogshit. It's a stepping stone, or a great weapon for someone just getting into raiding. Fuck right off
---
Legendary
---
&gt; It’s nice to have counters and shit.
---
Tell me what class/spec can counter a Subtlely rogue in pvp ?
---
&gt;And if something is OP, jump on the train.
---
Lets see you down Ragnaros with 40 rogues.
---
No gnome priests :(
---
If they blow their cooldowns, sure they can take out 1 target. But they suck in group fights and blow without their cool downs.  Soul link locks take them out, warriors take them out, Paladins win that fight too.
---
Full bis on my main rogue, including tf.  Might take few years but im in no rush 😁
---
Cross-realm BGs and 1.1 talents were also part of vanilla
---
"Without further ado, the release date for Classic will be...
---
never game's cancelled we're closing the forums ok bye"

Similar. My account was hacked and upon recovery, some kind soul had farmed me the Sandstone Drake.
---
#NoChanges.nutshell
---
Blizzard ‘could’ do whatever they want with your account. It is in the TOS.
---
It’s all about backlash and profits. Would they risk a bunch of negative reactions and lost revenue over taking action? Maybe, idk. Back then, they said that this is the point of a PVP server and the funeral should have happened in an alliance zone if they wanted to avoid this. But back then they also said they would never sell gold or level boosts and now they do both, so they do change their ideologies when it benefits their bottom line.
---
If a rogue can I'm sure a druid can
---
Hogger Mafia.
---
I never really did it after tbc came out so possibly?  2004/05 there were at least a half dozen runs I wanted to delete my characters when we got stair bug
---
[removed]
---
I got that helmet on my Dwarf Priest a couple weeks ago and thought, right I’m satisfied now no more PS I can wait for Classic. 
---
Edit: have started an alt Druid.
---
There is no feeling of accomplishment? That's inevitable after you play the game for 15 years straight. Burn out.
---
The huge time barrier gating you out of playing alts.
---
But my dude, the struggle is half the fun!  That's what gives some dungeons a sort of mystique.
---
My mistake. Then hunter. Only a few hunters are brought along so you don't have to fight too much for a lot of your pieces
---
Raids take a long time to gear up 40 people. ZG and AQ40 still provide upgrades. Maybe if everyone is fully kitted out it won’t be needed, but that’s taking some time.
---
Fair, and true.
---
Except that both having cross-realm BGs and not having them are a no changes stance. 
---
It was never about being pure 1.12, but about having no stuff outside what was present at any stage in vanilla WoW. Since they were indeed present in vanilla (but not during most of it) one can very well debate whether or not they should be in Classic without any contradiction of the no-changes philosophy whatsoever.
---
Christ...
---
This 100%
---
So why don't we do it #nochanges then? That way crbgs won't be on the table until like phase 6 (closest phase to patch 1.12) or later, if we really want to be #nochanges. They were in the game, but not until patch 1.12. 
---
Since the rest of classic is gated behind phases to be more "vanilla"-like, then so should crbgs. 
---
Having crbgs in the game before phase 6 would be... gasp... changes.
---
I worry a bit about what the community has become with regards to that.
---
In a relaxing group thats fine with exploring and not knowing the way around, i expect it wont be a huge problem.  When people get into 'rush rush rush, cmon noobs!' mode its going to suck.
---
So you think its likley they would ban people for pvping. On a pvp realm? I'm just trying to understand. That's ultimatley what you think?
---
Bunch of alliance are RPing somewhere. Let's go fuck them up. Oh wait no. There might be backlash due to outrage and ideologies. Dood. That's ridiculous
---
r/gatekeeping is leaking
---
You might also consider making a 39 think, if you are going to go all the way to 35 anyway. I assume hunter is great at that level, though I’m not an expert (and no idea on lock).
---
Amen. The rank system blew ass in terms of time invested vs rate of return. The best way to get tricked out for pvp is actually pve. Wish young me had known that.
---
Can you make Tauren Warrior Tank? These are Spectacular!
---
dkp with minor loot council interference (gearing up MT....thunderfury etc) but fuck a straight loot council...if you're not one of the bros who hangs out in discord all day sucking each other off you wont get gear.
---
if nepotism can be exploited it will be....you cant cheat dkp...you either earned it or you didnt.
---
Asmongold. Hes a streamer. Hes actually one of the more intelligent inbreds I've seen.
---
Arcanum. Necrosis. Any other additional buttons/utility of that type.
---
does it proc off heals?
---
The one I saw that was the most insane was leveling warrior and deleting a skill every time you die.
---
Most people wont hit 60 before the end of 2nd month, probably even 3rd.
---
You'll be fine
---
&gt; You know what is also frustrating? Seeing your mortal enemy stealing your black lotus, but being unable to stop them because they didn’t flag. Most people on PvE servers will not flag themselves. So if you enjoy PvP, you will hate being unable to fight the opposing faction.
---
counter point - i arrive early at a node and am halfway through mining it and i can do so without fear of being sheeped / ganked and having it stolen from me.
---
I mean you *can* skip them entirely but I’m not sure why you’d want to. There’ll always be bits and pieces that people will need for upgrades.
---
On top of that ZG provides great rep rewards and AQ20 is needed for some reagents for beetle sticks and whatnot
---
yeah amen
---
the bulk of players will take weeks to hit 60
---
its fine dont worry, the longer it takes the easier it will be to find a raiding guild
---
Na, I am saying I wouldn't put it past Blizzard to ban people for purposely grieifing an event. They knew about the time and place of a peaceful alliance event purposely planned out a counter-raid.
---
Ultimately what I think is they are going to do what is best for their bottom-line and not worrying too much about what it means for their understanding. They would rather ban 50 accounts to save 100k subscribers over the year even if it leads to a long-term downturn in PvP.
---
I am not saying it is right; just that I wouldn't put it past Blizzard to do something about this. Something like: 24 hour ban from the Horde guild that coordinated the raid, a new funeral set up with GM support offering an invulnerable area inside Winterspring.
---
I am not saying I think it is right, or that this event is not a standard example of PvP, just that I think Blizzard would take their bottom line over their ideas about what world PvP is.
---
Pretty much this, every loot system has its pros and cons but really it comes down to the players in your guild more than the system you use.
---
&gt; The only time you can pvp is if other people flag themselves
---
or...you know...battlegrounds when theyre released
---
So about 2 full runs?
---
Not being able to do Karazhan at 10pm with 9 friends (the one part of TBC I wish were in classic).
---
Weeks? Try months.
---
Get Corrupted Ashbringer on my Ret Paladin.
---
It really won't be a big deal if you aren't 60 in the first week, only the poopest of socks will get there.
---
You won't get into the realm first guilds but you wouldn't have time to play on their schedule anyway so it doesn't affect you.
---
Blizz DOES expect it to be fair. They just say they don't cause renting more servers for a week or two isn't lucrative. They don't care about queues for a short while, it'll pass and go back to normality.
---
Ah shit I mean Blasted Lands, which is 48-54..
---
Every town being thick with 55 elites would probably do the trick.
---
When the community wont shut up about how its different from vanilla because one pixel is out of place. I dont look forward to seeing the chat log spammed by people constantly bitching about retail and how bad it is. Just stfu about retail, play classic and enjoy it.
---
yeah
---
azmon's mum had 50 days playtime when she hit 60
---
so i would not worry one bit if you take longer than 1 week
---
I hope not. That'd be going too far, but I wouldn't be surprised.
---
Yah but honestly I think everyone loves this shit. Who would have rather this not happen? Its gold brother.
---
If you are multi boxing some flight path npc I could see that being an issue.
---
And I think this example of pvp is one of the most epic ones out there.
---
11/10 would jiggle again.
---
I plan to play daily (and potentially dual-box) and my expectation is to be 60 after 2 months. 
---
Don't feel like you have to rush. When you're not playing, you get rested. Rested from 35-40 feels *so good*.
---
And Classic is a great game even if you have a few hours to play. Jump in, get some quests done, jump out. If you only have 30m or so-- do some crafting, play the AH, jump out.
---
"She loved to PvP"
---
I got ya covered! Have to help out a fellow Classic player. Will only cost you 1000g a month. LoL!
---
This shit would be on cable news today.
---
Play your way not the devs way
---
/r/wow
---
Something I don't see a lot: there's only so much lot to go around. I'm unsure of whether dungeon weapons and dual welding beats a good 2h weapon, but raid level 1 handers aren't going to drop so much that everyone gets whatever they want. I expect a decent number of 2h warriors (who may be high on the list for off tanking) because you share 1h swords with rogues and other warriors and a 2h might be there best you have a lot of the time.
---
Play your way, not the devs way.
---
Class Leaders, but you’re overthinking it.
---
As long as your main tank is reasonably geared you can start Molten Core with lvl55 players filling the raid spots
---
I hope this is a troll
---
While i agree with you on a lot of points, there are a lot of people that prefer the new direction of WoW (maybe not BFA specifically) and there's nothing wrong with that, no need to bash them.
---
Just be glad that we're finally getting the version of the game that we prefer
---
Last time I played, I intentionally made things harder on myself - using bad gear, turning off XP gain, things like that. Tried to do every quest in every area. Even stopped to cook the random meat I came across. I'd say it made things BETTER, and the quests themselves were actually pretty fun.
---
But that was only fun for one month's subscription. It was a bandaid, and just made me miss the old days.
---
I'll need on stat sticks, and will give stat stick bows to rogues.
---
If you prefer that direction you need to be punched
---
I haven't played vanilla but agree 100%. I would add how every class is "balanced" - every single one has same or very similar utility and disposable toons keep being recycled whenever a new raid comes out... Retail is an Action MMO, definitely not an RPG. :/
---
Keep on trollin...
---
Cope.
---
It's off that the toon disappears from Warcraft realms before the release date of tbc.
---
I got my first epic there so I'll always have a soft spot for ST too.  Aesthetically it wasn't my favorite but I really liked the design/structure of it; it really felt alive.
---
Seeing this post makes me sad and think this subreddit has gone too far. 
---
Mate spend your time with your kids and wife. Hit 60 in a few months who cares. So many people will burn themselves out. You’ll get geared if you play for long enough don’t worry just play for fun. 
---
Just to be clear 60 in a real life week is nuts and will require absolute no life especially for someone inexperienced with power levelling
---
If you think it's OK to punch people over their game preferences, you need to talk to psychiatrist
---
Grinding out an UBRS key.
---
is skinning gonna be worth it in early game around launch? my concern is not having enough gold and that I won't outlevel the crowd so mobs will be camped, so why not sounding dead mobs while I wait and vendor them. 
---
but on pservers it seems like 3s for 20 light leather is not really a lot. I'm only 20 on the pserver, but it seems like even though mobs on LH are camped constantly and I skin them that I don't get much roi for them. I'm not sure what I'll want to do.
---
That's just not true. Classic will use 1.12 talents from beginning to end, same with item stats. Your entire post is just wishful thinking. gasp.
---
It makes me sad that the classic cast guys are friends with him... They all seem to, you know, not suck.
---
Both ZG and AQ20 have very nice loots. ZG especially with all the spell hit gear available helps casters. Warlocks benefit the most since they get no spell hit from talents for Shadowbolt, so [Bloodvine set](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=421) is amazing. ZG also has the [enchants](https://classicdb.ch/?search=Punctured+Voodoo+Doll) and [buffs](https://classicdb.ch/?item=20079).
---
Ideal goal: at least clear naxx once
---
More realistic goal: Full t2 and pvp r10 epic riding professions maxed with a 29 rogue twink/29 warrior twink
---
Paladin is the main reason I'm considering Alliance.  I've never played one before beyond 20 so now is my time.  It still hurts to be abandoning the Horde though.
---
You said you were a hardcore raider but you have never heard BiS? What kind of "hardcore raiding" is that?
---
not personal enough. faction rivalry is what makes wow good, filthy casual allaince carebear
---
“Played” classic at age 4. Come on friend, it’s ok to say you were too young.
---
To loosely answer the questions though, the original game had a more traditional RPG feel with a colossal social element that no modern game has.
---
All classes are friendly to pick up but some have higher skill ceilings than others. If you want to get good then you’re best approach is to be humble and open to criticism. You will learn faster and get further socially. 
---
11/10 excited to return to a social MMO
---
I know this is a joke, but please don't ostracize retail players. There are people who realize those are 2 different games with different goals, and loving one game is definitely not mutually exclusive with loving the other.
---
Sorry but I just don't like the concept of "us" and "them". What will you call me when Classic releases and I play both games? One of us or one of them?
---
Also if you're a dedicated player farming a BiS list before raiding takes no time at all. Just have to know what you are doing. I've don't it on too many toons to count now. 
---
GUILDS WANT YOU TO PULL YOUR OWN WEIGHT and getting yourself equipped in full BiS before showing up proves you'll put in effort.
---
lmk what your character names are gonna be so i dont play with you =)
---
Your attitude is exactly the type of toxicity i wont play with in classic.
---
I recommend a dual monitor setup with netflix going on the other screen.
---
Meta will be turning the laptop screen into a gif of the Skyrim intro
---
Careful. you might have fun with that attitude.
---
That's not BiS.
---
Understood.   
---
But.  
---
"They Started It!"
---
&gt; Yeah, and Atiesh is not something a guild needs. If you have Naxx on farm you have essentially beaten the game as a normal raiding guild.
---
Guild accomplishments are not measured just by bosses killed. Having members with legendary items is certainly a guild-wide achievement, even if you're not the one wielding it. You helped get it; it's an accomplishment for your guild which means that tag under your name means a lot as well
---
There was no bashing though? Just a personal opinion on the current state of the game. Still I agree with you, some go overboard with the fanboy-ness. Example: above reply lol
---
It’s okay to like a game. Just remember if NO ONE liked retail wow you wouldn’t be getting classic. 
---
Retail players kept the game alive and for that alone they deserve recognition while you went to play for free on a private server (which doesn’t actually help wow in anyway continue) they did so now we got offical classic servers to go back to.
---
Bashing retail players is pointless
---
Yeah, that's absolutely true.  A different mindset could change everything.
---
There was prebis you just weren't very good at the game and didn't know what it was. Don't pretend people didn't expect you to pull your own weight back then too.
---
&gt;  And at that point it's not longer about "the guild", it's about individuals wanting shiny stuff. 
---
Those individuals are generally your friends, though. If my friend is working on his T3 set, then I'm motivated to help him.
---
They're catch up mechanics except for the last bosses which drop loot on par with BWL.
---
So you're saying you are fine with having Naxx in the game from the get go then? That's the same thing as saying you're fine with crbgs in from the get go. Both two pieces of content added in at 1.11 and 1.12, respectively. It's the same thing.
---
We aren't getting a 1.12 finished game. 1.12 is going to be the BASE, where they work backwards (see phases), to produce a vanilla experience.
---
That was for rank 10, rank 8 is even easier.  I wouldn't consider rank 8 to be an issue for anyone who really wants it, regardless of your real life situation (excluding extreme circumstances obviously.  You're not getting rank 8 if you can only play 5 minutes every other Thursday).
---
Of course there's time for all the mandatory stuff like sleeping and eating and taking care of whatever responsibilities you might have outside work.  If you want to reach the higher ranks you basically just have to make WoW your main hobby for a month or two, as if that's much of a problem for us here.  You can take breaks if you want, skip WoW to catch up on Game of Thrones one night, or socialise with some irl friends.  I did say you wouldn't have time for *much* else, not that you literally wouldn't be able to do anything besides work and play WoW.
---
It's really rank 11 and up where you have to start dedicating amounts of time that most normal people would consider too much.
---
As long as it's temporary, I get it. I don't like it, but I get it. Hopefully after the first two-four weeks or so things will have died down enough that sharding can be taken out (hoping for two, but I'm really not sure how popular/flooded classic will be once the retail tourists go back to retail).
---
Getting 5 gold or 10 rep for someone you're already exalted with, so exciting!
---
Good guilds will be picking good players early on, if you fall behind the pack you are doomed to play with mediocre players for the rest of the server, that is only of the reasons most people want to rush to 60.
---
You meet great people while doing the first MCs/Ony in the server.
---
You notice I said with oversight?
---
ok, friend
---
Yeah think its just mostly for rep, same on the alliance side for night elves
---
The majority of the Atieshs on retail are 100% due to 70s farming Naxx in TBC.

Awesome mate. 👍
---
You can find upgrades in ZG/AQ20 if your guild is still in MC when they come out. These instances also serve as a catch up mechanic for newer guilds who find it hard to get 40 dedicated people together and still want to gear up.
---
You'll still want to gear out all 40 individuals, that takes time.
---
It's weird that you say it's from private servers. That's an absolute lie. Lots of guild have been asking players to work towards BiS as a way of just proving they are dedicated. If you want to raid but won't go out and get some extra stuff to make it easier on everyone then we don't want you. It's pretty much about making life easier for the rest of your guild and not being a lazy mooch. 
---
I'm not saying you need full-bis at all though. One guild I played in required pretty much everyone to be full BiS before MC and it was sad because for most classes MC gear is a massive downgrade. So the whole BiS thing kinda can kill fun for people and I understand hating it, but it's not going to go away.
---
ill grant that only because vanilla legendaries were cool without being overdesigned, but the idea that medivhs personal staff was just this simple stick of wood seemed all that more impressive to me. like he had such a keen mastery of magic he managed to keep all that power in a simple rod
---
In a way, this video immortalized Fayejin better than they could have hoped. 
---
I wonder if she was a fan of pvp, and what she would have thought watching this.
---
Rest in peace.
---
Nope. #nochanges
---
How would you be fucked if you don’t hit 60 in the first week?
---
  
---
Good Lord.
---
BiS still exists. Look it up. Literally even that shithole Icy Veins has BiS item lists for every spec in current content.
---
I had a warlock demon lock and release a doom guard in the Shire town just outside of Stormwind... This shit sucks. Funny as ALL HELL though
---
Ptr not beta.
---
cool story bro.
---
Let’s hope there’s a client side third party reskin for totems we can download, don’t think it’d be too hard to make. 
---
Don’t see blizz adding it
---
That would be super legit. Someone who has art skills should do it!
---
DHKs are great dont be little bitches
---
Keep lying.
---
Mate if this happened today and Blizzard banned the players than classic is going to fucking suck.
---
Why on earth would they ban people for playing the game? If you want a funeral where you don’t get tanked by a rogue have one in real life. 
---
I severely hope Blizzard isn’t this far gone.
---
WoW.
---
&gt; or make them immune to aoe spells unless directly attacked.
---
&gt; 
---
This is how they worked in the 1.12 game version,
---
Who's online? Guild group? Pick up but organized? I have no private server experience but ran with my guild all the time in vanilla and it was mostly about who was on and wanted to play. You're going to roll pure pickups anyway, so getting the right group only mattered when you were hoping to face another good group.
---
You do always need healers, and I know some people who wouldn't join a group without a warrior, but there was no class we never took or hated taking.
---
Classic will get the 1.12 version of everything. You're confusing 'time gating' and '1.12 version".
---
Did Naxx exist in patch 1.7? No. Then you're not getting it in phase 4.
---
Did BGs exist in patch 1.7? Yes. Then you're getting the 1.12 version.
---
If it existed in patches before 1.12, then you're getting the patch 1.12 version.  If it didn't exist, you're not getting it.
---
Never said vanilla
---
You'll be able to count how many people will be 60 after 3 days. Which will be nobody.
---
You shut your mouth, as cool as that would be, cant have a classic summer if summer is almost done. I hope June, but prolly July.
---
And a punchable personality from the 10 minutes I have watched of him.
---
That's cherrypicking, though. DHKS weren't out when the honor system wasn't out. That's just like saying putting no PvP rewards in the game is nochanges because there was a point where there weren't any. Technically, yes, but in actuallity, no.
---
Thanks
---
Female dwarf pally here I come.
---
Thiiiiiiiiiis
---
Going to love spending some time on the mage, the priest, the hunter, maybe even a paladin for shits and giggles and memories (my first toon was a paladin, as it was a favorite class from AD&amp;D).
---
But my poor warrior main will take SO much longer to hit 60 that way. :-(
---
How is that gatekeeping? OP clearly contradicts himself and Beardamus points it out with two words and you immediately jump to gatekeeping? seems like a bit of an over-reaction
---
No changes means you have to go back to your mom's basement (if you've even left it in the first place).
---
&gt;the guy is wearing shoulderpads
---
In your dreams
---
If it existed in patches before 1.12, then you're getting the patch 1.12 version. If it didn't exist, you're not getting it. BGs existed before patch 1.12, then you're getting patch 1.12 version. Blizzard is very consistent on that.
---
You're not doomed. Guilds will need new members all the time. Especially in classic.
---
Why are people so delusional when it comes to this game. I do not understand. It's like the plague sweeping this subreddit.
---
le S T Vietnam. upvotes to the left.
---
You will need the enchants from ZG. Every guild will run it once a week if they want to compete. The enchants are miles above anything else.
---
laughs in Druid shapeshifting
---
Desolace. Steer clear of STV
---
Depends how sharding works I guess.
---
Otherwise you wait in queue or skip it.
---
Having a guild that survives Naxx
---
The tagging and respawning system is horrendous. Spawn camping a single mobs respawn point with multiple groups all trying to get the tag is frustrating.
---
AMERUCAAAAA
---
My guild only killed 3-4 bosses per week at most, but shards we're not a very common drop.  We only ever saw a handful.  Even if you're farming all the bosses and all the shards go to one person, it would probably take well over a month to complete.
---
Honestly, if I was the person that died I would have loved nothing more than my funeral turning into a huge pvp shitstorm ingame.
---
Low effort troll post
---
i never did it but there is or was a way to reskin shit in retail wow so shoupd be possible
---
Not really.  TBC (at least everything in 2.0) was probably all planned out by the time Naxx launched.  They just gave a fun perk for use at 70 to the most dedicated 60s.
---
Lol he wasn’t trying to attack you, insecure fuckhead
---
Was going to respond to that post with something similar.  1.12 is what we are getting - not having cross realm BGs would be a change, and thus “no changes” means cross realm BGs should be in the classic release.
---
That poster seems to have missed the point in that.
---
I couldn’t believe they did away with talent trees.
---
I literally was telling a friend that I must have picked my secondary skills, and I had to find the talent trees.....
---
i want cross realm bg's because i dont live in america and want to be able to bg any time of day without long queues
---
This thumbnail looks a lot like the album cover for [Currents] by Tame Impala.
---
Hahahahahahah. 
---
It’ll probably be fixed though :)
---
&gt; this game has changed, sadly for the worse. In almost every way.    
---
Nerds made WoW, Corporate greed raped it.
---
I can't wait to do exactly this.
---
Get my ass on your friendslists, warriors. I ^love ^ ^ You
---
I don’t see any of the good guild’s on here xD

you can, but it sure is miserable on a weapon based class.
---
I’m a diehard misfits fan.
---
When I started to learn about who they were I said “omg it’s that logo that all the goths wore in my school!”
---
The goths were right
---
New guilds will be forming all the time. So there is no rush whatsoever if being first isn't your goal.  If your concern is staying with the pack, then getting to 60 by phase 2 or 3 would probably be the cutoff. But that will (hopefully) be like a year down the line.
---

---
Hey, hey, hey ! Let's not go that far.
---
The week 1 idiots followed by Ony attunement.
---
Afaik the legendary AQ mount is more rare. Quite a few people got their Atiesh during TBC, so many that supposedly the majority of all staves are from post-vanilla.
---
I bet there will be a mod that does this
---
Naxx and some Aq loot, health just doesn't scale as fast as damage does lots of t1 has more stamina (albeit not a huge amount more) than t3, pretty well kills all the joy in pvp.
---
Tom cruise is a class??
---
Frostmages in raids don't go deep frost since there's nothing of value for them in that tree beyond Frost channeling. The standard for raiding is a 31/0/20 Arcane Power Frost build, something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#ofME0ocquZVi0c0f) (might be off a few points here and there). You get everything of value from the Frost tree, while the Arcane tree gives you mana regen, more max mana, clearcasting, more spellpower &amp; crit and finally Arcane Power.
---
So, if you're deep frost for a pvp/pve hybrid you'll have to gimp both: PvE because you have mana problems and no Arcane Power, and PvP because you're taking threat reducing talents etc over CC / better slows.
---
It's only good if you're a stealth class or on a PvE server or on a super imbalanced faction. Otherwise, most people are just going to get ganked over and over and over and over....
---
It sounds like this guy hasn’t done any high level mythic+ content. Let me tell you, anything higher than +11 is multiple times harder than anything in vanilla, some of the mechanics used behind the trash pulling and killing is insanely higher skill cap than using a few CC spells on a mob in UBRS.
---
People underestimate just how bad most people were in vanilla. I think a lot of people will be really disappointed at wow dungeons if they aren’t scaled up a bit.
---
It's going to be a cluster fuck of unprepared noobs that are too used to today's instant gratification gaming industry. They'll complain night and day until blizzard finally cave in and ruin it somehow for the genuine players.
---
Is a point in nature's grasp worth it over the 5th point in Heart of the Wild for feral hybird PVP druids?
---
https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com/
---
Yes, but current WoW did not exist then. People who played vanilla at the time will get along just fine. They'll either love it or just lose steam and stop playing after a while. It's the retail fanboys who have never experienced anything pre-cata or even pre-BfA. Especially with the addition of M+, speed running and facerolling are the norm. These people will lose their shit when some trash mob of the same level kills them in a couple shots.
---
Yeah. At the end of the day, I’m not even bothered by it if it’s just for the 1-10 bottleneck. I just hope Blizzard knows that they will disappoint a lot of people by pushing it past that. Imagine being in Hillsbrad even, and still getting tossed around into different planes of existence here and there.
---
Because it’s not just an immersion thing. If you walk into a separate shard, and there’s 2 mobs you just killed ready to pounce, you could easily die. Or walking into a cave and suddenly 3 horde appear and kill you.
---
Or the lamest one I remember from retail. When you see an ore or an herb, run over to it, and halfway there it disappears. You take a step back, and it reappears. It’s there, but forever out of your reach. 
---
I think Blizzard should be aware that if they don’t plan launch to be capable without sharding past 1-10, they fucked up.
---
Cool! I was just speculating/interpreting the phrasing in the post.
---
Every addon from Anaron (Norwegian addon maker I think). He made tons of useful addons for a certain private server he played on.
---
They do what a lot of other addons do, but they are super small and leightwight without a lot of other bullshit that you didn't ask for.
---
Trying to find a reliable AND tolerable set of people who play on my schedule so I can get a reliable 5-man together for weekly dungeon dives.
---
Ohh, that was exactly my first point. Most horde are undead, so as ally you have to face WOTF. Then as horde you don't have to deal with that. But it's not that big of a deal as people keep pushing.
---
They are plenty good enough, but they aren't BIS. People aren't going to pass up on upgrades just because they aren't BIS. The lists are just something to aim for; if you get an another upgrade while doing it that's great.
---
Hi, /u/et0s_381
---
Lol if you hadn’t logged in since vanilla you would have had about 20 free respecs by now. I do miss warrior dual wield 1hers, dual wild 2hers is one of the dumber things they’ve done class theme wise.
---
God I hope they don't do cross-realm BGs.  I'm really excited about battling against the same players, throwing shade on the forums etc.  Server identity is something I'm really looking forward to in Classic.
---
I disagree only because the hybrid part IMHO shouldn't be about your spec but how you play. When I think of a hybrid I think of being able to multiple things during the course of an encounter, not being able to fulfill different roles.
---
Anyone who thinks getting to 60 within 3-4 days is mandatory is dilusional and lives in a basement. If you get to 60 in two weeks to a month you'll be fine.
---
Very, *very* few people will hit 60 in the first week.  World record is something like 4 days &amp; change *play time*, which you'd only be able to do in a week if you were playing 20 hours a day.  You'll be fine!
---
Plus, getting caught in the zerg is part of the fun for many of us.  Ganking/getting ganked in ST, competing for quests &amp; rare spawns, etc.  Having a full world is going to be a huge part of what makes Classic a success IMO
---
You're going to be vendoring all but thick leather while leveling, as the prices will be similar to vendoring it. It will still make you some extra gold when you are farming beasts.
---
In level, age, or both?
---
Guaranteed naxx will be cleared first day it's out.  It's not 15 years ago game is figured out
---
No Gnome healer
---
Dont forget your PIN number
---
Deadmines was brutal.  WoW was my first MMORPG and I started playing like a month after release, I remember the days where I thought 3-4 wipes was a "good" DM run
---
pretty sure they said the PVP gear is the 1.12 version.
---
I'm trying to get a job, so if i have one at release i can't take time off. So I'm just gonna plan for like 4\~ hours of leveling a night weekdays and like 8 hours a day weekends.
---
I agree with everything you said here but hunter gear doesn’t scale very well so those who get the best possible gear and perfect their rotation, they will always be behind a good warrior, rogue, mage. And because of this, a lot of those min/maxers will stay away from hunter because they want to be the “best”
---
I honestly have no idea. Most people vendor them, but I don't know what the economy will be like.
---
You can't really steer clear of STV tho. Such a huge zone with so many quests. To skip it entirely would mean hours of grinding to make up for it. Fuck that.
---
I had a Druid carry me through ZF many times. That’s the highest I’ve seen done by themselves.
---
Pre-raid bis also give you something to aim for outside of your regular raids. I know I was still hunting that epic hammer from BRD up until I got a weapon from BWL.
---
Hijacking--what is the etiquette on a BOE epic world drop? I was never around for a drop of one of these in a group. Does everybody just Need? If I were a druid tanking a five-man (hypothetically speaking) and the Warden Staff dropped, would I need on it and everyone else should be expected to greed?
---
I can only imagine being new to the game loading in, playing for two hours then seeing this.
---
EPGP is a priority system that spits out a ratio of Effort Points (do some raiding and boss killing) and Gear Points (get loot, get points). So if you don't take any loot but participate in every raid your ratio will be very high and if you take every single loot your ratio will be low. When a loot is distributed the person with the highest ratio should get it. If two people with the same ratio want the same item then it's up to your guild or loot master to decide how to distribute the item.
---
!Badbot
---
Ah yes the true Classic experience! I played on launch day and it was....not very playable day 1. I mean servers were good enough until about the time everyone hit level 5-10 because I made it out of the Mulgore starting area before getting shut down by lag. 
---
I remember specifically the lag being bad for moving around but if you stood in one spot it wasn't too bad so I resorted to just simply fishing for a few hours until the lag cooled off. After that initial lagfest, it went smooth.
---
I’m likely going Shaman and leveling elemental while healing with that same gear for dungeons as much as possible. On my first shaman I just leveled pure resto and I just leveled a bit slower but still easily 
---
Or, same concept but holy/shadow priest.
---
Gear is the same, basically (I’m sure somebody will respond and give a slight technicality on how it’s different). 
---
You can also heal dungeons just fine as elemental.
---
no one will have a 60 in the first 3-4 days.  The record on pservers with xp we arent sure is correct is 3d9h played.
---
If it takes you 6 months to hit 60 you can find a guild with people that are the same.  If you dont play for the first 6 months and then take 6 months to level you will find a guild with people that are the same.  
---
Do what works for you.  You won't be "behind"  You can see all the content and have all the fun.
---
Also fewer hunters are brought to raids, so if you get a slot, prove you're worth keeping, and don't get replaced, you're g2g. (Only problem is you gotta get a slot).
---
I have leveled non stealth classes through STV on ridiculously overpopulated private servers. Yes, you get ganked a bit, but by and large the pvp that happens in that zone is with players around the same level. Trying to level through redridge is worse imo.
---
lol why are you in this subreddit!?
---
female tauren warrior it is then
---
Got it - thanks for explaining!
---
Those 14 hour Tuesday maintenance days forced me to go outside once a week.  Might not be a bad thing to bring them back.
---
In TBC I cleared 5/6 MH &amp; 5/9 Black Temple.
---
In WotLK, I got the Glory of the Raider achievement, cleared Ulduar, and 11/12 heroic 25-man ICC.
---
In Cataclysm, I skipped the first tier, got to 6/7 heroic Firelands and 6/8 heroic DS.
---
In Mists of Pandaria, I did 5/6 heroic MSV, 3/6 heroic HoF, 3/4 heroic ToES, 8/13 heroic ToT and cleared heroic SoO (with 40 minutes left to server shutdown for 6.0 patch!)
---
In Warlords of Draenor, I did 6/7 mythic Highmaul, 5/10 mythic BRF and I quit just before we cleared heroic HFC.
---
It's not that I don't know what BiS is, it's just I've never heard anyone ever chasing it apart from twinks. The people who were obsessed with numbers (that included me) knew that for a given gearset that you have, different stats will give different value. For instance, the more crit % you have, the more valuable spell power will be. Getting BiS items never made sense because they're only BiS if you have the whole set. Furthermore, I never had content on farm for so long that people would actually even be able to get to BiS since the next raid was always around the corner.
---
Timbermaw if you're going to be an Enchanter.  Exalted gives some of the best weapon enchants in the game.
---
If I recall, the Felwood grinding is around low 50's and the Winterspring one is mid to high 50's so they're a good option during the bracket where you're already running low on quests.  There's going to be some massive competition though.
---
Cant wait for the people of Angermar's 0.01 second respawn timer.
---
Yeah I’ve heard they can heal most dungeons while leveling regardless of the spec. Just have to keep a cloth set. I’m just worried end game that isn’t possible. I don’t need Bis gear but I’d like to be capable of holding my own in the raid and PvP seen. Hoping some good gear will overlap so I don’t need two full separate sets.
---
They should put things like this as graphics options.  They are purely eye-candy, so why should anyone care what sort of totems I see?
---
because your grammar is errant
---
Eh, it isn't that clear-cut. Threat is a huge problem in Classic WoW, and humans put out a not-insignificant amount of extra threat vs. NE's. Extra MT threat means less over-zealous DPS pulling aggro, and extra MT threat means an overall higher DPS threshold for the whole raid, meaning that total raid DPS can be higher which means there's a shorter duration fight, making it easier on healer mana which mitigates the benefits of dodge% in the first place.  
---
Usually, if the boss is stuck on smacking the MT / OT the whole raid, your fight's probably going to be fine, the healers should have the mana and you should have the HP pool to survive for quite a long time.  
---
Plus, to compound the threat problems - warriors gain much of their rage from getting hit by enemies, and dodges mean no rage generation for the warrior in question. So, NE's not only innately put out less threat than humans but are further hampered by slightly less rage generation than any other race in the game overall.
---
Lol yeah its weird right? My guild didn't give a fuck about that when we downed Lucifron with 27/40 people some of which were under level 60 and most of which were in greens/blues. And this was Horde #2 kill, we were one of the top guilds so it wasn't like we just went in and did it when most people were in BWL or AQ.
---
Booty Bay transporter.. you even get past a few elite mobs via the transporter.. you dont have to walk from IF and wait for elevator etc etc
---
I didn't hate DHK's. I hated that they were RECORDED. Do you know how fucking annoying it was trying to keep your counter permanently at zero? SERIOUSLY?! Ridiculous. If they leave DHK's in, they need to REMOVE the tracker so you don't have to STARE at a 1. Or a 13. Or a 712.
---
Not even decent. With 40 people you can carry easily. We started raiding strat/scholo/ubrs with like 15-25 people and eventually moved on to MC in greens/blues some people under 60.
---
Care to explain what sharding is? I've never heard of it before.
---
Sunder Armor doesn't really care about glancing blows, and your threat gen comes significantly from Sunder Armor, but glancing blows do matter
---
I respect that. I do the same.  I will level my shaman as resto. When I was alliance I leveled as holy. I play wow for rpg even if other people are not.
---
Yeah I was kinda sad when they said it would be the legit rank system because I already know I'll never get rank 14 and those sweet weapons. But, eh oh well, it'll just be that much more of a special moment when you see some dude in IF/Org in the full set WITH weapon.
---
Go on retro-60 and try versing warriors/rogues/hunters/paladins that know what they’re doing and see how you go.
---
its supposed to be vannila wow not some custom wow server with feat7res from multiple expansions
---
Some players who are serious about PvP will respec weekly for PvP and PvE. It's a gold sink, but that's classic. If you want to be able to do both without doing so, warlock is the way to go.
---
I guess you should cry a whole bunch about the content release phases then.
---
The prepatch released blood elf npcs into the world as a ind of opener into them joining the horde, so there were a few quests for them that gave rep. AV quests (and many other quests around the world) gave rep with all horde factions. Including, during that limited time, the Blood Elves.
---
Think you’re confusing first literal 3-4 days with days played.   Like total time played on that character.
---
He implied I was a lesser human.
---
You think that's going to be the main complaint? No they're going to complain that they can't kill a single quest mob because Hogger takes like 60 seconds to spawn and there's a queue of like 150 people.
---
eh I dunno TBC had too much custom options for BiS lists to be reliable. If you're following a cookie-cutter build it was fine, sure. But the biggest example is the release of spell haste gear and no one knew at the time it came out that it was good. Mages/locks passed on it and since I was a newer raider with lower loot priority (and a Warlock) I would get handed it. Well I went a non-cookie-cutter fire-destro build (everyone was affliction or shadow-destro at this time and stacking crit) and it just so happens that haste was perfect for that build. Despite being a newer raider with a lower gear level I was often in the top 3 for DPS charts and even was #3 on our first Illidan kill despite an entire phase being fire-immune.
---
There was zero info available about that build online at that time.
---
I mean obviously its different know with these things being known for years, but I'm just saying it wasn't entirely your fault if you didn't know about BiS when the gear is first coming out.
---
I’d imagine you could do brd with top end gear. ST has a MC fight that will bug out if you’re trying to solo it I think. Zf/Mara/ulda would all be pretty easy I’d imagine.
---
Try seeing it from a raid leader's perspective, or just someone who's making a group. 
---
First, I'm the tank.
---
Second, I get a healer.
---
Third, I need to get 3 DPS. Do you know what happens when I ask for a DPS in LFG? I will be bombarded with whispers from all kinds of DPS, and I'm not going to pick a ret paladin, enh shaman, ele shaman over a mage or rogue. There is never a lack of DPS, so these shitty meme specs that will be out-DPS'ed by me, the tank, will never get into my group unless I suddenly can't find anyone and it's only the memespec whispering me. 
---
This isn't about toxicity, I'm not at all toxic when I play, never elitist and always helpful, but you don't have to believe that. Anyway, if the spec you're playing is so shit that you can't even keep up with the tank, that's not on me and I shouldn't be called toxic for that. I don't play to carry people I don't know. My attitude isn't the problem, it's someone else's attitude to think they are entitled to get into groups.
---
Loved kiting Kazzak to SW and Green Dragons to Org, I hope it's doable on classic!
---
Crbgs in from the start is 100% a change. Crbgs as a feature post phase 6 would not be a change. I'm fine with crbgs, as long as they aren't in at the start (change), and added in with their respective phase.
---
BiS for some of the classes includes world drop epics. Good luck farming that before your first raid.
---
My guild got our first 3-5 MC boss kills with people under level 60 and most in greens/blues not full blue. MC is easy. We even first killed Luci with 27/40 people.
---
i would not care if they just released 1.12 with no phases
---
The true priestly calling.
---
Wod launch was fine? hahahha ya ok you must have really low standards
---
It limits the ways you can game the system, but it doesn't remove it completely. I don't completely understand what is the problem here; You should not use EPGP or DKP in a pug, and as long as the items end up used by someone and not as shards it's OK.
---
I love this video!
---
At least it would be an Authentic experience and the #Nochanges community will support this.
---
Suicide Kings
---
Completing Naxx.
---
I'll likely never beat vanilla.
---
Classic+ would be great if they did it in the way Jagex handles Old School RuneScape. Community polls and basic changes that make sense, IE something like "this random mob that no one ever kills because it doesn't drop anything now drops a basic crafting material" or "this piece of gear that looks the same as 14 other pieces got a slight recolor" idk just basic shit like that the community could vote on.
---
Gearing your ele while raiding as resto will be a lot easier than you think. Bis resto gear is mostly +healing so that shouldnt be used in pvp. But you can easily gear full t2 and still heal perfectly fine while simultaneously use t2 for ele pvp. As well as t2.5 being actual BIS for resto pve and for ele pvp. So once aq hits youre golden. Also the resto weapons you want from mc/bwl are great for ele. As well as the shaman bwl trinket is good for both specs as well.
---
On top of that any mail related caster gear is going to be up for rolls since there most likely wont be any actual ele shamans raiding. So those pieces should be rolled by all the resto shamans that want it equally as offspec/pvp.
---
and there's always people quitting and being replaced or re-rolling who need to gear up quickly.
---
A man after my own heart.
---
My list is very similar.
---
Reflect as in more the general RPG term for return damage, like Thorns. It isnt a proc, its just flat damage every hit.
---
This is hilarious
---
If I can get Perditions Blade again that’s all I really need. Adding core hound tooth to OH would be nice too. 
---
When I got it the first time (back in 2005 I think?) it was probably my greatest gaming moment ever. At that time it was a huge game changer for my rogue.
---
if noob, no boob

I dont want crossrealms where in classic

I thought of Tom cruise when I read your comment.

Then you're in for a rude awakening playing classic.
---
Support classes are a thing that don't exist in modern wow, that did in classic; and your ignorance and obsession with a DPS meter isnt necessary. 
---
Grounding totem has value.
---
Windfury totem has value.
---
All resistance totems have value.
---
Druid marks of the wild have value.
---
Warlock curse of elements has value.
---
support classes exist, your attitude is indeed the problem. That mage has even higher DPS because of the warlock curse, your tank has higher threat because windfury procs get him extra dmg and that means threat.
---
Again, respond with your character or server so i can avoid you =)
---
I don't think anything would overlap. + healing and +dmg/heal are two different stats. You're not going to explode if you use a bit of +dmg gear for healing or a mana/5 trinket for ele but it will be far from optimal. For a proper setup for both specs you'll need a completely different set of gear.
---
You can do Mara princess and tinkerlock farm also as feral. I’ve farmed both of them on the current pserver North****. I included the croc only once I’d gotten the hang of it, if you miss time bash to drop the bleed you’ll probably die. 
---
Princess is a little confusing to start with as most other classes kite her around at range. For feral Druid you’ll fight her melee around the large rock just off the bridge to her by the giants. The rock corners are LoS that blocks her pulse dmg if your just around the corner. 
---
Basically you dmg her in bear mainly, she will wreck you in human form.  
---
she pulses and you move slightly to be around the corner avoiding the pulse dmg. 
---
On a pulse you can move around the corner and HoT and shift back to bear. 
---
Assuming ofc that the LoS rock thing works in Classic. 
---
Tinker is literally tank spank he can’t fear you because of Mark of the wild giving you enough shadow resist + 60 lvl difference to resist it completely every time.  Do him in bear as well till confident. 
---
I started cat with a pounce and then got a full rip on him then just went bear, very easy fight. 
---
I recommend getting mining and or herb as mithril and a few blindweed nodes always spawn, that’ll help your GpH. Hope this all helps you out mate 👍
---
In a way, they have been immortalized by this funeral raid.
---
For the Horde!
---
Test realm for BfA 8.2
---
Yes everyone should roll need. You could all agree to roll greed, but you run the very real risk of 1 guy saying "lol fuck you all" and rolling need. Or saying they need it and will equip, but then they just get the epic and leave the group.
---
Even if it's an amazing upgrade for someone in the group, the value of selling it is far greater and obviously applies to everyone :)
---
Everyone needs.
---
Now that you mention Sunken Temple, that place could be good to farm the trash as a skinner though. I remember that placing being heaven for skinners.
---
holy crap it doesn't have a little plate or shoulder cover on the opposite side, my whole life is a lie.
---
=c i've had bannerlord in my steam wishlist longer than we've known about official classic. I'll probably be playing classic before bannerlord comes out.
---
I  think NF/CONFLAG is really really juicy man. I thought of going SL/RUIN but it doesn't seem to synergize well since i'm completely avoiding shadow talents. But, I think NF/CONFLAG has enough defenses and pressure to 2 vs 1 people even if they're competent as long as you can burst them down fast enough and reset the fight quickly or CC them off for a bit.
---
Heh, that was probably the most arrogant thing I've ever heard someone tell their customers. I was literally flabbergasted someone could utter so stupid a phrase.
---
The paper flowers add a nice touch

2019 - " Lul Turn off warmode"
---
Man I blanked on twinks until this thread. Totally gunna make a 29 twink.
---
Awesome! Just what I was hoping to hear! Not sure what T2 is but I’ll google it. Looks like I’m rolling shaman. Was once alliance but now I’m for the horde!
---
If you hit 60 in the first week... Jesus you have probably done this way too many times with too much time on your hands. I’m going to try and not have a lot of downtime but also enjoy each milestone. Getting 10, first talents, class quests, grinding gold for my mount, go back and level a weapon skill because I got the whirlwind axe. Etc. but hey different strokes for different folks.
---
And having a life? I suppose that´s of the table as well.
---
What you do is pick a meme spec and become so good at your class that you stand out around everyone else
---
&gt; No reasonable person would demand you have 100% pre-raid bis before even considering joining a raid, but there are a whole lot of unreasonable people who impose that demand on others.
---
It's not that unreasonable. There might be 2-6 positions on a raid team for your class, any relatively hardcore guild needs a way to filter recruits.
---
This statement is very misleading:
---
&gt;It sounds pretty unrealistic to be able to get an exact items especially since some of those items have low drop rates or require high gold investment. It could take months.
---
It won't take months for any class to obtain their pre-raid BIS. Yes there are casual players with low play time, but they're not applying to guilds with strict BIS requirements since those guilds usually have playtime requirements as well. And no one is expecting you to get ultra rare drops like Ironfoe, they're a bonus but generally not considered in pre-raid BIS lists.
---
&gt; And having a life? I suppose that´s of the table as well.
---
My vacation starts tomorrow.  Dont fck with me like this o.o
---
Yeah,  those support classes were called healers, not shit tier sub-tank damage dealers. None of those things have more value than better DPS. Better DPS means faster kills which in turn means less damage taken and less mana spent healing. 
---
Not sure why you're trying to argue their viability when the point is that they don't provide more viability than anyone else does while also providing heals or damage, but should be brought anyway because "oThErWiSe iT's tOxiCiTy."
---
I don't recommend Warlock since theres a 16 debuff limit on bosses so a lot of your DPS might be kicked off the boss by others. Hunter is a pretty good choice overall just pretty consistent damage and I cant say anything about Shamans except theres a lot of micro management
---
&gt; I quit the main wow sub to not have to interact with your kind. (Yes, you are blocked) 
---
I wonder if this guy has a job and has personal communications and is the sort of individual who tolerates people who have differing viewpoints than his own. Seems like this isn't the case.
---
That was a nice bonus, they popped up unexpectedly as I was adjusting the zoom.
---
I can hear exactly that.
---
Nice burn there dickhead.
---
&gt; You can’t risk the DHKs if you care about your honor gain at all. 
---
That's correct. You were never interested in actual world pvp, but merely the honor you could farm from it.
---
Warrior. Everyone else is wrong.
---
suck my dick
---
Makes perfect sense. Cheers :)
---
suck my pipe
---
You make a group of 5 players and stand on his spawn point trying to get the tag before other groups. If you don't want to do that just skip it and go kill something else.
---
I'l be 60 week 1. I expect there to be, maybe 20-30 others there.
---
I expect our first MC clear will be a co-op of 3-4 guilds teaming up as we prep for the rest of our members to level up around week 4 or so.
---
Kt kill
---
R14 would be the PvP equivalent, but ain’t nobody got time for that n e more
---
This is great! When blizz announces realm names it would be good to add realm names to this list.
---
dude, the pve system in TBC was much better than Vanilla, and the pvp system in TBC is what ended up breaking class design.
---
You have a few things wrong imo. 
---
Hunters do have a high skill cap, especially in PvP. Unfortunately their gear doesn’t scale well.
---
Really fun class but usually overpopulated and later in the game you only need 3 in a raid at most.
---
Warlocks are pretty simple from a PVE rotation stand point. PvP they have a higher skill cap as well. Usually not overpopulated but for some reason there’s a lot of warlock hype for classic. 
---
I don’t really know anything about shamans. I do know they are needed in raids. 6-8 is the preferred number. Also elemental is really good in PvP if you get T2 or better spell casting gear.
---
True, but I think Hogger will be just one of many things in the starting zones that could take hours to get done.
---
I can't see any casuals making it much higher than level 6 on day 1 if dynamic spawns aren't added for the starting zones.
---
Sorry, didn't bring my tweezers.
---
Yeah there is literally no way Atiesh has the Kara port for that reason. 
---
The TBC announcement vid from 2005 show clips of Kara. That’s quite some time before Atiesh was added in game. 
---
They wanted to add Kara in, in Vanilla, per John Staats, but cut it pretty early, as they felt they had enough dungeons. 
---
So, it was slated for TBC well before Atiesh was put in game. 
---
Of course, that rumor persists here, because people want to believe it. A simple read of John Staats book would correct that perception, but alas.....
---
If it was Horde doing the raiding I would approve.
---
But since it’s Alliance scum doing it, it’s time for some (additional) vengeance.
---
&gt;  The people who really care about DHK affecting their honor are farming BG's all day for higher rank, not attacking quest hubs. 
---
People say this out of one side of their mouth, and then say "DHKs kill city raids" out of the other.
---
The TBC announcement video at Blizzcon 2005 has clips of Kara. 
---
So, you are correct, it was planned well before then.
---
I mean that’s cool but it really has nothing to do with Classic.
---
when you have one front tooth
---
PvP will die out on servers without cross-realm because queues only pop at certain times if its in-realm only.
---
You’re not alone. WoW was supposed to have new content, so naturally some of the content is really cool and interesting! Goblins are titties man!
---
Stonard portal wasn’t in game until 2.2 or something anyway. So for about a year it was your only solid port in that area, as a hordie.
---
cringe
---
&gt; Every town being thick with 55 elites would probably do the trick.
---
Yes, that's what we ended up with in TBC after DHKs were removed. Nobody wants that!
---
There’s going to be two circles of players.
---
The mix maxers with years of private server experience and the rest of us.
---
You’ll be fine. A year after the game launches there will still be new guilds trying to down rag for the first time.
---
This. Paying to respec sucks
---
i always thought this looked like my exes mum
---
Does your dad work for Nintendo too?
---
&gt; No DKs was a part of vanilla, so having no DKs is also classified as "no changes".
---
BY that logic, "No Honor System" was also part of Vanilla. That way, no one would care about DHKs.  Win-Win.
---
Besides the middle tooth I was thinking it looked like Will Ferrell.
---
+ ankh
---
I would just quit on the spot.
---
JK.. I have nothing to quit! ^^^^:(
---
BURN THE HERETIC
---
Takes 20h average to 20?youll have plenty of people on your server.
---
Sure. If one wants to spend 15 years theorycrafting a dead game to find every advantage while also applying the mechanical skill/game knowledge gleaned by 100,000,000 million people over 15 years and clear all of the max level content in 4hr 37min 49s (including travel time) from MC to Kel Thuzad--Have at it.
---
Personally, its the opposite of how I want to play the game. All of the content is clearable with a balanced raid comp. Hell, I'd argue its clearable with 5 of every class except the 3 alt warriors (in full tanking gear) you'll need for 4 horsemen. Further, that presents the fights as more challenging, which until Naxx classic raids are pretty easy by comparison to BC or even modern Mythic raids. 
---
Im all for min maxing too, but class stacking--aside from one fight--wasnt needed to kill anything in classic. Min max your feral druid ret paladin spriest enhance sham to you hearts content, be the best hybrid. But if we are bringing 5 of every class that leaves us with 15 healers at most, so if you have a feral druid and an spriest and a enhance sham now youve got 12 healers, youve just made the fight more difficult and more fun. 
---
I like killing bosses, I like learning fights. When I raided on retail I was all about progression. I aimed to have the raid team I was a member of be front page of wowprogress. Nothing else mattered. As soon as progression was done, I was instantly bored. Learning is fun, even a little bit of parsing is fun. But 3 years of doing among the easiest raids ever made in the most min maxed highest potential raid dps possible sounds horrible. 
---
Im hopeful to find people who want to be good at the game, but not autistic about the game.
---
I actually had a dream last night they announced the release date, i need help.
---
The only 100% "PvP only" mage spec I know is 21/0/30, for PoM and Imp Counterspell. If you go full frost, you are a little more PvE friendly, with good CC/AoE options - I think a lot of specs were as extreme as 2/0/49. This proved strong enough in PvP, but again lacked a little in PvE in long fights with mana consumption. IIRC, if you really wanted to min/max your PvE spec, there were slightly better options with less CC in frost that were best used for a PvP spec.  
---
So for PvE, you would go Arcane for Clearcasting, while giving up things you don't really need in raids such as... ugh, brain... the proc that gives 5/10/15% chance to freeze a target... can't remember what it's called atm. And you might not get all (or any) of the "Winter's Chill" in a PvP spec, but you need at least 60% proc chance for PvE (although I've heard of some mages going with 20/40% IF they had 3 or more frost mages in their raids). Also, the mana cost reduction/threat reduction talents in frost are a MUST have for PvE, and meh for PvP, because PvP is better off putting points into the talents that increase the slow of chill effects by 4/7/10% - I think - in frost, then spec into Arcane and pick up the mana cost reduction of Mana Shield in order to get enough points for PoM - which is not preferred for PvE, as you shouldn't be taking physical damage often enough to spec into that.  
---
At any rate, anyway, this was part of the beauty of Vanilla. If you wanted to be the best in both worlds, you either needed to farm for the gold revenue to respec twice a week, level a second toon, or do the best with what you had (AND THIS ACTUALLY WORKED).  
---
Unfortunately, gold farmers provided a way to alleviate this, while drastically ruining the immersion and fun of the game, also allowing players to "pay-to-win". Outside of that, most people who were actually "best in both worlds" (without dual-logging or buying gold) played 12-16 hours a day. And even that wasn't a gaurantee of "being the best" - I would know. I was a scrub who logged almost 7-10 hours daily from November '06 through 07, and I never got past PvP rank Sergeant Major, and never cleared more than the first three bosses of BWL. (Warrior).  
---
I died a LOT. But I learned a lot. And I carried that knowledge into being a very successful gamer in WoW in future expansions. I never forgot the lessons I learned in Vanilla, and as the game morphed to alleviate the grumbling from those lessons, I grew disinterested. I know this is a long post, and I'm sorry about that, I just sorta got it in my head at the moment, that this is part of what I miss about vanilla WoW.  
---
It forced me to make decisions that weren't easy to make. Win or lose, I stuck by them. Like playing a warrior with a stupid name I couldn't change, in a game I didn't understand, but couldn't simply abandon for a new character due to the investment I already made into it. I wasn't the best. I wasn't even good. I was bad. And I died. All. The. Time. I died while tanking. I died while farming. I died in BG's. I was honor fodder and a healer's nightmare. (But I could hold aggro, which was kinda funny). And I loved every minute.  
---
Then, somewhere along the way, things became easier... I rerolled as a hunter in TBC, and again as a Mage in WoTLK. I had flying mounts, multiple specs, finished all of the raid encounters... and by the end of WoTLK, I was an arcane mage PvE/frost PvP. I made 2300+ rated 2v2. I was missing only one piece from Heroic 25m LK, and outdps'd (while taking less damage) all of the "top players" on my server, and then in my battlegroup.  
---
Eventually I would join BG's just to frost nova and kill most players with a shatter combo (or two, if their resilience was high enough). I remember a BG where I had 63 kills to 3 deaths. And suddenly, it wasn't fun anymore. It was too easy. Too fast. Want a mount? Just add money. Want gear? Speed run raids. Want PvP? Zerg and hope for a quick win, quick honor, quick gear... Everything was instantly attainable, immediately available at your fingertips, with little or no consequences for the choices I made. It was mindless entertainment. So I "retired" from WoW, and outside of one attempt to return, only to rediscover the same, mindless entertainment, I've been watching from a distance, waiting and hoping for the "old ways" to return...
---
T2 or t2.5 just means the tier sets. So t2 is tier 2 that drops from black wing lair (bwl). The teir 1 and 2 sets aren’t the best gear for resto, but you can still do perfectly fine just going for those sets. And they will double as decent for ele so it’s win win.
---
I did by farming dire maul east jumpruns to get the gold to buy them. Try again.
---
My GM got it and yes, it's as hard as you make it out to be.
---
I've done this on so many toons in so many guilds too. I also am married, work, and have a social life. I really don't get where this whole issue with time investment comes from.
---
That's not what was said, kind of a weird quote to just throw out there.
---
Yes you are. This project is about creating the original version of Warcraft as it launched  for many people such as myself who never even got the chance to experience it. The last thing we want is this bull shit. Can we consider this when the games been about 4+ years and then we’ll talk? 
---
For now let’s discuss classic wow and not all the world of Warcraft Remastered My Way* edition conversations some people want to have in. 
---
TLDR: nochanges
---
The play is to not hit anything. Always be the last person to click need/greed. Unless you are a thieving bastard, you at least know you are honest. 
---
If everyone agrees to roll greed (fucking dumb, always need all on BOE blues and epics) and one person rolls need, you at least reserve the option to roll need too. If you roll need and win you can sell it and divvy the gold up 4 ways between you and the non scumbags. If you do this, be clear of your intentions. 
---
But I'm not going to give up my opportunity to roll for an item because someone needed on a greed all. 
---
Alternatively, you removed everyone else's choice and immediately roll need.
---
I’m planning to rush in a duo as a tank my hopes are to start Mc ASAP to get a MT spot even if it’s not full clears gear and exp are what I need.
---
 A true madlad would do one first and then the other.
---
It did not change. Your gear mostly does not matter.
---
You can game the system by being clever. Old legendaries, and tier sets will work in many cases. So you can do fun things like stack Azerite pieces, with old tier 2 piece, and a pair of legendaries from Legion, to boost your performance.
---
But, m+12 gear (which legit no longer exists as it caps as 10 now, but I digress) and 119 quest greens all scale down to the exact same ilvl in timewalking. 
---
I do have to say, the person you’re replying to seems a bit confused or under informed, outside of just that initial comment. Timewalking dungeons are difficult or easy based on how hard the actual dungeons were themselves. 
---
So TBC and Cata timewalking stuff can be hard. You’re scaled down enough that often the mechanics have real impact. This can be mitigated if 2 or more of your party members are stacking gear, like I mentioned before. If not, then as the primary OP stated, you need to actually know the strats.
---
With Wrath, Pandaria, and likely with the upcoming WoD TWs....well...those were all faceroll to begin with. So they’re faceroll as timewalking. If you’d only done those, you wouldn’t have an accurate view of the matter, due to that. 
---
So, yes, you are correct, gear scales down. The guy you’re replying to seems to not be well informed here on several points.
---
Well, like I said, Northrend and Outland were content cut from the initial release. Why not restore them? Eventually the player base will hit a wall....
---
I’m a huge fan of playable goblins... but not in Classic, Classic is for classic races and classic class combos and limitations.
---
I can give up my personal favorite race (If only for the size difference being hilarious) in exchange for the Classic experience.
---
What do you mean by breaking class design?  Arena definitely ended up drawing larger attention to class imbalance, but I don't see how it broke class design.
---
not Classic but please do Nagrand
---
You can have your Draenei shaman in BC, no? It’s like Vanilla-Xtra.
---
You must have been one of those who had a balanced, populated server (or didn't play vanilla at all, seeing as cross-realm came in vanilla) 
---
Odds are you'd be the first to drop PvP when you realize the queue time is an hour and when you get in you'll just get farmed at the graveyard by a pre-made
---
What constitutes Vanilla WoW? Want the LagMonster to come back? I sure as hell remember the LagWind and LagForge back in the day. Isn't Classic supposed to be about the game mechanics and social interaction (all of which were thrown out the window in dribs and drabs)?
---
In vanilla I once kited the dragon from duskwood into SW, it was a good time, not nearly as catastrophic as kazzak though lmao.
---
But those come from quests too. I've leveled a warriors and rogues multiple times only questing and doing my dungeon quests. SM is a pretty good example of not needing drops because quest items are rewarded.
---
I've seen zero sum DKP systems that work fine without resetting between tiers.
---
Zero people had it on my server. We didn't have any guilds kill more than a handful of Naxx bosses. Most didn't even see AQ40. There was maybe 4-5 Thunderfury total, about the same with Hand of Rag since by the time you got to BWL no one cared to farm the mats.
---
I did this with my hunter in vanilla, kited the dragon from duskwood into SW.
---
The point of Classic, from the past 12 years of people asking for it, through its announcement, through its development, and into its release - has always been to recreate WoW as it existed in Vanilla.  
---
Developing new additions that would drastically altar the mechanics/itemisation/content/gameplay of vanilla is fundamentally un-Classic-like.  
---
There may be a place to talk about it 12 months into Classic release, but before it's even been released is just silly.
---
Did it with a guild group. It wasn’t out of the ordinary. 
---
They’ve done a lot of tuning passes on Cata TW in particular. I’m guessing they sorted that out.
---
Because the point of this project is to recreate vanilla WoW, not create WoW 2.0.
---
Maybe once we nearing the end of classic there could be a discussion about new servers with all kinds of additions and changes, but right now the goal is to keep things vanilla as much as possible.
---
Ret pallies are dangerous if played right, but they're incredibly bursty. Mages, Rogues, Warlocks, Hunters, Shamans, Druids, Priests and Holy Pallies will kill you in most cases. Can kill Warriors. Sometimes.  
---
Feral Druid, you can kill Priests. Maybe. Shamans. Sometimes. You might get lucky and kill a  Rogue. But Warlocks will laugh at you. Warriors are cake if you heal and stay in bear form. Kite them a little bit and they can't outlast you, but if you stay kitty form you die - fast. Mages get frustrated because you can switch forms so they can't kite you, and you win. Hunters get mad because you can stay in their "dead zone" and you can generally outlast them with a couple of quick heals. Pallies... again, same as a warrior. Kite, engage in bearform, don't get stunned in elf-form, win.  
---
Basically, Druid for PvP &gt; Ret Pally for PvP.
---
Arena broke class design because it forced the Blizz devs to homogenize the classes in order to create more comp viability in arenas. 
---
Class homogenization = broken class design.
---
Warriors are fun to play.  Been playing warrior since the beginning and will continue to do so in classic.  
---
Why let what other play bother you?  Just play what you want and have fun!
---
I also long for the first half of The Burning Crusade. Alas. We can dream.
---
Buddy of mine made R12 with a Paladin while working full-time and doing PvE 2/3 days out of the week.  
---
It can be done.
---
Oo, announcement?
---
What if my shit turned purple and smelled like rainbow sherbert?
---
I really don’t mean any offense by this... but I don’t think you get the concept of the game. The answer to your question is: OF COURSE ITS FINE!
---
It took most people most of a year to hit 60 in Vanilla. The people who hit 60 in the first week will have fun for a while being the top tier, but then they’re just going to log in for raids and that’s it. 
---
That’s fine too, but 98% of people aren’t gonna rush. There will always be a community around you, whatever level you are at. 
---
So, if you can average 2 hours a day, you can easily hit 60 in three months. So, world record is around 4 days, about 100 hours. You’ll probably take twice as long, so 200 hours. That’s 2 hrs avg per day, for 100 days, or slightly over 3 months.
---
Classic WoW is the only version of WoW where rested bonus is gold. If you leave your toon in an inn for a week or so, you’ll have over a level of 100% extra XP from mobs. You should keep this in mind when leveling your multiple toons.
---
This is either a failed troll attempt or you are just not used to classic.  If it is the latter, you will be relieved to find that the majority will not hit 60 for MONTHS
---
The release of new servers in Wrath devalued the AQ mount a lot as whole guilds transferred over to take advantage. Atiesh gets a slight edge imo
---
pretty sure client-side reskins are against TOS/EULA and are bannable
---
Perhaps the rankers can have their own self sufficient party following the raid?  Dont worry about the rest of the raid, just worry about your party and moving onward with your glory next to the raid. You should all be aware enough to avoid getting tagged to the dk
---
This post did make me kind of sad. OPs considering quitting before they start, because a lot of people in this community are stressing how important it is to *them* to hit 60 in week 1. 
---
Meanwhile, that’s going to be a sliver of the population. People are free to play how they want... it just seems extreme, and our subreddit is obviously biased towards the more extreme fans.
---
I think we should be able to do the quest chain up until the last step, where we have to return the item, in order to keep Dartol's Rod.  Thoughts?
---
Shaman you will have a blast! Gameplay style always changing as the gear you get does, it really is fun.
---
In early cata dungeons, I played the worst healing class in the game (priest), ran with an all melee group (no cc, high damage taken), and none of us were a high enough ilevel to queue for heroic so we had to walk to the instance.  It was an absolute blast.  The desperate attempts at trying to keep people up after OOMing when the boss was still 50% are some of my best memories of the game.  LOLWell became one of my highest heal spells due to mana efficient.  By far my favorite time in WoW.
---
Is druid damage that much better while leveling? I've never leveled a pally or druid past 30; I've leveled a variety of vanilla classes to 60 but neither pally nor druid. I've heard pallys being slow but as far as actual combat goes I've heard druid's damage in world pvp is also quite slow and you win more so with your utility than your damage output, which is fine but I'm just curious. 
---
Also, if you don't mind, from a casual perspective of someone who may do just MC/Onyxia and possibly BWL, how easy/doable is it to get gear at lvl 60 to be used mostly for pvp combat? I'm willing to go resto to get into raids, but is there gear obtainable from those raids that'll really help or should I not worry about it?
---
I doubt that happened. You probs lying just didn't pvp enough. I remember farming like 50 dks then continuing my pvp grind and my rank didn't go down
---
ZG is a blast, and likely the first raid youll be able to do.
---
I love Maurudon.. i think its the colorscheme but also all the water and stone elementals.... cant wait to run it again
---
Are we playing the same game? It’s not an issue with the time commitment, it’s an issue with spending time farming gear that will improve your performance by at most 5% pointlessly. Especially since you can spend that time raiding instead.
---
“So many toons” - how many, exactly? Vanilla lasted just a bit over 2 years. That’s not a lot of time to raid with multiple characters.
---
Missing the forest for the trees.
---
Ol Ted Bundy lookin ass in the back
---
SM was bad ass
---
Awesome so sounds like I’ll be able to get relevant gear for both while raiding. Maybe not Bis but that’s fine. Thanks for the help. Now to decide the race haha
---
I play vanilla wow religiously dude
---
CRBGs would be inappropriate in 1.12
---
They were added in 1.12 as a fix for a problem that will not exist in Classic for quite some time.
---
A small imbalance in faction populations gradually becomes a larger and larger one (especially on pvp servers).  CRBGs were implemented to remedy this, since a 70/30 faction split was basically a deathknell for battlegrounds.
---
It's silly to try to fix a problem before it exists.
---
I agree.  It was an absolutely terrible system that was only implemented because the devs were too unskilled/stupid/overburdened with other tasks at the time (the reason for most of the horrible design parts of Classic or any video game) to make the DHK targets unattackable instead.  And it's very strange because there were plenty of NPCs in Classic that didn't interact at all with the opposite faction: no aggro, being attackable, or anything.
---
But anyway, this is one clear aspect of Classic that was an extremely poor decision.  RPGs are supposed to be about a balance between immersion/roleplay and gameplay, and this was not balanced at all.
---
To be fair, it's very obvious why they did it.  My issue is with how they fixed the problem it was trying to solve.  My only hope is that this is the best they could do and that they would have made all "villager &amp; quest" type NPCs unattackable if they had the time to spare.  Then again, I figure whatever flag they use to determine an NPC a DHK could have been used to flag them to be unattackable instead, but who knows what the coding of WoW was ilke back then?  Might not have been that simple.
---
To read stuff.
---
Farming consumables, collecting world buffs, blowing through easy early raids with our 1.12 talents, playing on a PvP server during phase 2.
---
Sharding the early zones splits up the population so there is less people
---
I've actually leveled 3 warriors to 60, a rogue, 6 mages, a warlock, a priest, a hunter, a shaman, and I'm currently working on my second druid. My raidig experiences on these classes is limited to priest, hunter, mage, and druid though.
---
Oh that's sick dude I hope they do that so my casual friends can at least make it out of the starter zone the first week.
---
&gt; Arena broke class design because it forced the Blizz devs to homogenize the classes in order to create more comp viability in arenas.
---
It didn't though.  Class homogenization didn't really occur until a little bit in Cata, and especially in MoP. Even then, it was stated to be a direct response to pve issues, not pvp.
---
She liked fishing. And snow. And pvp.
---
Gotcha. Interesting note: the Drain Life effect of the skullflame shield scales with spell damage, and the lifesteal is 1:1 apparently. Supported by comments on the classicdb page from  tbc and wrath. Drillborer doesn't seem to scale, and force reactive disk scaling was removed in 1.9, so this might also be a factor for paladins...
---
I want cross realm because on my old vanilla server, AV was dead. It just wouldn't pop. On a high pop server nonetheless. Nobody queued, and nobody wanted to waste their time sitting in the queue because you can only be queued for 1 bg at a time. Effectively it wasn't even in the game. Would be sad to miss that experience yet again.
---
It will only be 1-12 zones I think... if they decide to go with this option.
---
Has sharding or dynamic respawns been brought to Blizzard's attention or addressed by them?
---
ST is brutal. The dragon packs are huge and will wreck you solo. You can stealth and kill some of the troll mini bosses, but that's about it.
---
They have talked about them but have not decided on anything yet.
---
Imo IAotH is only good if grouping, rading or kiting. 15% hp &gt; 5% if you are going BM for lvling even if your pet management is superb 15% more hp all the time is better.
---
what is the point of soloing this boss
---
It was my first character, and id run the first 3 bosses like 8 times, but the group always fell apart. So i buckled up and started a group first thing Saturday morning. Every time someone left, i ported out and found a replacment. 12 hours later, it was done.  
---
I did a lot of time wasteful stuff back then I wouldn't now. Like my gnome mage's first mount was a stripped saber. I think i was lvl 45 or so lol. I HAD to have it.
---
Yeah, about that....
---
It hasn't stopped the modding community yet. :V
---
Ur screwing up the other party members who did nothing in that case. I would either kick the ninja or ask the group to kick him. Then I'd leave if they didn't agree.
---
Oh yeah that's true. Kinda sad really.
---
Number one goal is to not be a fucking retarded altoholic. Really hoping I can lvl just my lock to 60. Tons of pvp and some half decent gear. Dreadsteed ofc. Haven't decided on professions but probably tailoring/enchanting or herb/alch. So I'll want those Max with some nice recipes. 
---
I'm sure once I talk my 2 irl friends into coming back to classic they will both want to be a lock. And then I'll probably roll a mage. Then I'll be sad I'm not a lock. Then they'll reroll and I'll lvl my lock and be decades behind the rest of the general pop. Well see. I'm fortunate enough that I can dedicate 4-7 hours a night playing (work nights, baby sleeps at gf's house except weekends)
---
I'd like to raid. But I couldn't find a guild that raids at 2am-6am pst in legion or bfa. So highly doubtful I'll find one for classic.
---
An updated version of questie that doesnt bug nor has annoying features ( like showing where all quests are on the map 24/7 even if completed) would be great.
---
Where do you download them?
---
I ran sm as a tank even when I was lvl 50. My favorite dungeon.
---
Not having a necklace equipped on this character hurts my soul. I remember “of the bear” necklaces and just necklaces in general being pretty rare.
---
why
---
I agree, but no );
---
Alliance having shaman is a pretty drastic change in mechanics for one. Not really comparable to lag.
---
Dude, that person is basically immortalized now in this video, though. They'd have been forgotten within a year, otherwise. We're *still* talking about it to this day, and will for years to come.
---
Personally I'd have been both touched that people would set it up for me, and hyped for the WPVP it caused. I can't speak for the deceased, though.
---
Sure is fun to queue into a premade team of rank 12+ people over and over and over and basically never be able to win a WSG.
---
Source: I played on boulderfist alliance, home to ‘Shamans r teh overpower’ who were considered the best PvP guild of vanilla. Was almost impossible to get into a winning battleground if you were on the same time schedule as them.
---
*sniffles*
---
I forgot this was a thing. AHHHH GLORY DAYS.
---
I’ll be 60 in a few months haha
---
Gotta get that attunement first!
---
Decade long hunter vet, extensive arena and RBG experience.  Started in vanilla as a pvp hardcore spamming BGs and the open world farm so I'm speaking from the hunter PoV.  Hunters have no hard counters, but imho, warlock is our toughest match up in vanilla.  Early on in classic locks will be fodder and pop to an aimed multi combo.  Around BWL&gt;AQ their hp and spell damage will outscale hunters burst even in pure pve gear.  Before that if they gear for stam they will still be a challenge.  
---
Quite simply, hunter damage does not scale on nearly the same level as warlock damage and warlock health.  There isn't really a whole lot of skill even involved for an SL lock. All they have to do is put up their insta-cast dots, shadow burn, maybe nade into a coil while tanking the hunter damage and its GG.  If there is any LoS around GG the lock wins if he isn't full brain dead.  If the hunter gets a lucky crit or two they just pop a healthstone or void sac and resummon or face tank with drain.  As a hunter if we have a pile of engi, consumables, and other pvp toys ready then maybe just maybe we can pull out the win if the lock is unprepared, unexpecting, or undergeared.  
---
At the VERY high end (T3) you can expect 2900 aimed crits and 2200ish multi on a NON SL lock.  Knock off 40% from each of those from SL and the void and account for \~6k hp on the lock and you can see why that lock is going to giggle when you tickle him with your big burst. Then he loads you up with dots, pops his health stone, and goes back to what ever he was doing, ignoring you til your dead.
---
No, it's silly to not implement something that would improve the game.
---
Nobody is playing vanilla do they can sit in long hour-long queues or only get matched against sweaty geared premades.
---
The "but server community" is just such an incredibly weak defense unless you played on a balanced server and don't know any better
---
gold?
---
The thing is, people will have the raids done immediately. Very few things but resistance checks will stop people from clearing as fast as possible. But in a time where absolute minmaxing is key on retail if you want to stay relevant in raids, you will without a doubt see quite a lot of Atiesh’s and T3 if a random TBC drop doesn’t come out of nowhere. 
---
People think Naxx will be difficult, it absolutely won’t be. The mechanics of the game are just too simple for this day and age. The raid will be done ASAP on its patch release, many many times over around the world.
---
Is that the trinket from Gnomeregan?
---
If we're going with patch 1.12, can people still quest in raids? I thought they didn't remove that until WotLK
---
Yeah, that’s a charged gear of some description. Lol.
---
&gt; I play wow for rpg even if other people are not.
---
Rock on! I like my characters to feel like they actually belong in the universe instead of just a puppet for me. That's one other thing I'm going to do differently in Classic; I don't know much of the lore, but I'm going to pay a lot more attention to it this time around.
---
Why u wanna risk something that's almost perfection in many people eyes. This sounds like a awful idea. Downvote
---
Hi, /u/jcm95

Should be an official addon you can DL and from there blizzard would make a decision.

Young adult with a full time job seeking to experience the end game of vanilla wow for the first time. A former altaholic who will dedicate to one toon if there is a fun/active community to help me reach and play through the end game content. 
---
Currently undecided on a class due to a history of rolling many toons, but leaning towards rogue/mage or healer if a support role is needed. I'm extremely excited to quest, raid, and pvp this summer!
---
Obviously I have restrictions due to my current lifestyle but I can make time for the game since I have no serious commitments outside of work. I see myself as a mature adult that can follow community rules and will dedicate time to progress to end game content. I hope I can find my future guild in this thread. Please message if interested.
---
Not getting cross realm bgs would be the most retarded thing ever, dead servers are a guarantee on probably 75% of the servers. I 100% do not want to have bad RNG and pick a server that will end up dieing after a few months and never be able to que a BG because im the only one on the server. THat is non-sense, and if u think it is going to ruin classic, just quit the game and leave the forums, it was part of classic. In a perfect world where servers wont die, we all would pick non cross realm bgs, but its not a perfect world.
---
If that's the case then Hogger quest wouldn't be a problem, but what about quests where it's like go kill some boars and collect their meat. Would only 1 meat drop for 1 person in a raid questing group?
---
I thought the world record was like 103 hours or something? So like 4 days and some change. I agree with everything else you said though.
---
Touché

Yeah it’s gotta be that. Just gotta be!

Almost as if the guys first language isn’t English!!
---
Youll never hosed in terms of raiding. Theres always a cycle of guilds starting up and progressing.
---
Only THE MOST hardcore are going to be level 60 in the first week and this is literal no-lifing to do that. The... average hardcore will be 60 withing about 2-3 weeks and finish MC in 3-4 weeks. 
---
60 at a week 6-8 is right around the time the majority are dinging 60.
---
not the issue. it’s the fact that he’s 14 years old and a fuckin dork.

The trinket from hydra boss to do 4horsemen taunt in naxx.

The trinkets are great for some classes. Somewhat situational.
---
Caster gear with lots of hit % on it.
---
Bloodvine

Some of the gear has situational stats as well. May not be bis but can placehold over other stuff
---
I soloed Lord roccor and incendius ( I think that was his name) in brd as a bear in vanilla retail.
---
Hey, let me know when you get one set up. I'm interested, and I think I have a few friends who might be as well. Either faction is good.
---
nope. more tanks = more fun
---
One time I had my account hacked in wrath, he got my mining all the way up to max and I was pretty happy!
---
Literally one of the things I’m most looking forward too haha
---
That was me waiting for MC and BWL as a healer wanting revenge on a PVP server :)
---
lmfao you're going into the ignore list
---
Why rank 12 instead of 13? 
---
What class are you picking? 
---
Just curious &lt;3
---
who will know if you're a good player if you don't get into the groups to begin with
---
Strength can also be useful in some situations 👍🏻
---
Pretty sure it was on YTMND (ah the good ol days). I remember one of my guildmates had this as his banner on our forums.
---
It’s supposed to be about classic. Not versions of the game that came after 1.X.X
---
Blizzard employees have basically admitted multiple times that LFR and LFD were made to solve a problem we no longer have. The custom lfg part of the dungeon/raid finder window does a better job of what they wanted to accomplish. However people would unsub if they remove it now so....
---
uhhhhh...
---
If queue times weren't bad at all, then I'd be down for no CRBGs. But I was one who was on a lower populated realm and queue times at anything but level 60 were sometimes up to 30 minutes long, even after the implementation of CRBGs. Even with CRBGs though, at every bracket in the lower levels there were people I'd fight on a somewhat consistent basis and came to know by name, so it didn't ruin the sense of community for me either. But I acknowledge that my experience is probably different from others and I may be in the minority on this.
---
It took a while. I had mine finished up and another mage in my guild was almost done with his splinters. After splinters it was KT kill and... Ouro? I think, maybe Cthun, one of the AQ bosses. Then the Strath thing which was cool. 
---
Splinters were the "hard" part, it just took clearing Naxx for a month'ish to get them all assuming bad luck.
---
Stay out of Tarren Mill, damn it!
---
Not necessarily. Hardcore PvPers could farm honor in BG like crazy 2 hours, then go duel outside IF/Org for 2 hours, with no gain what so ever. If they would have gotten losses in honor for duels, they wouldn't participate in it, deterring them from an activity they enjoy.
---
This
---
Kinda freaked me out seeing the very first picture.
---
It's not often I see the birthplace of my dad mentioned on the internet let alone in a WoW post!
---
What (if any) are the limitations on switching gear during combat? I see PVP videos where people use frost /fire spell reflect trinkets against Mages, but do they have these trinkets equipped all the time, or proactively switch to certain gear mid-fight depending on the class match-up?
---
The Barrens, specifically Crossroads, is rife with kill quests. Kill quests for certain roaming mobs. 
---
How could 1 zone being required for every level 13-20 Horde player *NOT* be a bottleneck?
---
I’m on team UI changes. Remember that addon that someone made in MOP to help you find groups? Someone else is just gonna do it for classic. Why bother when the technology is already there?
---
Every weapon is a free roll for hunters
---
I get it, I'm excited to try vanilla for the first time but I hope I can get matching armor at least lol.
---
I would be pissed as my pc is not ready. Prolly can’t even handle classic with the current state of my HDD
---
Kids nowadays are also used to dramatically different gaming experiences than we were. Classic WoW is going to be a very foreign experience to them. I doubt it catches on with that demographic. Hell, MMOs in general aren’t exactly attracting young audiences these days, even modern ones.
---
Only need to be Honored, not Revered. You can probably also get it done with just 1 person. I don’t think the Aqual Quintessence (I could be wrong, but Eternal Quintessence has a 1 hour cooldown, the Aqual Quintessence didn’t) has a cooldown, it’s just consumed on use. So if you have one Warlock inside Molten Core moving to each rune as they’re doused, one Warlock and two portal clickers just outside Molten Core, and one Warlock and two portal clickers at Duke Hydraxis in Azshara, you should be able to summon someone with access to the Quintessence pretty quickly and get them all done.
---
I think the choice came out of immersion. It is pretty unrealistic to have immortal NPCs, and it adds a lot to the immersion of the world to be able to kill every NPC while raiding a town. In that regard the DHK system is pretty logical. Killing civilians is dishonorable.
---
With that said, I agree that the system takes away one of the most fun aspects of the game. Personally, I wouldn't really have a problem with just removing the DHKs and just let the factions sort themselves out. Potentially decreasing the respawn timer for civilian NPCs if it is longer than say 5 minutes. If alliance starts killing quest givers in leveling zones, we will go Lok'tar Ogar on those pretty asses so hard their mama in Stormwind will start crying.
---
Named XxLegolasxX
---
The main issue is that organizing a 40 man pug has a very big time commitment. You will easily spend 1-2 hours just getting 40 people together and to the dungeon. Then there is a bunch of trash to clear(which respawns).
---
You really want to make sure you are with a group that can actually clear.
---
It should be pretty ways with Photoshop. If you want help I'll offer my assistance.
---
Im ok with Client side Graphics changes.
---
Druid does it by wrath, star fire, moon fire, insect swarm, and heals. Completely different from how I’d imagine a Rogue would do it.
---
To answer your question, yes.
---
I loved TBC, I played it a lot. But the last thing I want in classic is stupid looking blood elf paladins and space goats. And don’t get me started on Kung fu pandas.
---
Princess is uglier than a mud fence
---
Ahh yea I was a DH tank and I've done all the timewalking (also know all the strats) and none of them have been an issue. I was also aware of the ability to stack legendaries though but I haven't really played Retail in 6+ months so I didn't know if they changed it up.
---
Warlocks and hunters are of a similar vein. They are easy to just hit a few buttons and be “ok”. If you want to be revered though, they both have a very high skill cap. 
---
Shaman PvP has a few choices. You can be amazing as a resto shaman, decent as elemental, or mediocre as enhancement.
---
Did you play ever quest? They're both MMOs, but they are barely alike past that... I guess "the Trinity" for group comp is the same but the design similarities basically end there.
---
We are currently looking for casual and hardcore players.

Epoch of Thought [H] | NA-PvP | Wed, Thu, Sun | 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore   About: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla WoW’s release &amp; became a top guild there. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.    For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a unique point-guided loot council focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.  What we expect: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of dedicated raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.    In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.  Raid Schedule: Wed, Thu, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.  Looking for: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; specifically seeking: top tier Fury Warriors .   Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication.   Those interested in guild leadership roles should send me a DM.  Apply: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message, but the less social can also fill out an application on our Website http://epochofthought.com/.  You can also jump on our discord  found on our website   Join us!

Honestly anyone who loved WoW would have loved the after effects of this event... in 20 years I am sure people will still be showing this clip [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ) \- I would have assumed she was a fan of PvP as she rolled on a pvp server.
---
Things like this are what make MMO's great.  The people who did the raid on them prolly were not even thinking about immortalizing her memory the way it circulated.  But if you think about it how many people have been immortalized in games due to one amazing incident that was never planned out.
---
they definitely check for mods like reskins.. way back in the early BG days I remember people would mod their client so that the rocks in WSG were tiny little trees, and since client-side there was no collision with the rock that everyone else saw on the map, the player appeared to just run straight thru it.
---
This is by far the best recruitment tool you will find for raiders ahead of the curve
---
i always try and do all quests in one swoop just for the feeling of turning in all at once. Even if i have tp go back for repairs or something mid thrue i hold them
---
Phase 2 will introduce the honor system, but BGs will not be released until phase 3. This means there will be a lot of 60s wanting to rank up, and need to do it in world pvp. The easiest honor farm for a 60 is killing players in the 48-59 level range, since they put up much less of a fight than a 60. You will be honor farm prey.
---
I hated them then, and I hate them now. #removeDHKs #someverycarefulchanges

In all reality, though, World of Warcraft and City of Heroes were the games that I could never beat.  I've played all manner of other games, including MMOs of sorts, where I could set myself goals that I would eventually accomplish, even over the course of a few years.  I'm not entirely sure what sets these two games apart from everything else, but I'm pretty sure that the fostered social aspect is what always kept me around.
---
WoW and CoH always brought me back by virtue of helping other people.  So really, I'll beat the game when everybody is my friend and I've helped them do all the content they want to do.  :)

Good lord
---
yep, pretty viable one after it got patched.
---
The stun has a little bit of range to it, enough to build false hope when I'm being kited.
---
I could be utterly wrong but I seem to recall the raid getting like a 2-3 day ban.
---
I dislike transmog for two reasons-     
---
1. Prior to Transmog, recognizing your enemy’s gear was the quickest and most immersive way of “sizing them up”. “Woah, that orc Warrior has Herod’s armor and Ravager. I’m not messing with him.” “Hah, that rogue is level 40 still in Defias gear. I can take him.” I understand you can look at your opponent’s health bar for the same reason, but it’s not as fun to me. I don’t want to have to guess at what I’m up against.       
---
2. Having a coherent, matching Tier Set was something you worked towards. You want to look badass? Then earn it! I don’t want kiddies running around looking like champions when they actually just farmed last expansion’s raid and actually suck at the game.
---
dang not on my server, it was 'nned tank princess' 'need healer princerss run' 'need some with sceptre inner mara' day and night
---
Theyre beautiful
---
Ahhh it burns!
---
Nobody expected all classic players to have good taste.
---
Sounds like a normal public sector job...
---
According the source below (which I have no idea what it is based on, and if it is a private server, I apologize) Blood Guard takes 25k RP (rank points) to reach, while Stone Guard is 20k. You decay 20% of your total RP each week (max 2500) passive, while a DHK reduces 100 RP flat (at 60). Based on this, I agree with some previous posts that claimed you most likely just didn't have enough honor gains that week to stay in rank. One DHK won't make or break you.

No flight point at rebel camp :(
---
I think you're right. I'm considering taking my vacation the week after it launches. I'll still try to play whenever I can when it comes out, but there's no sense wasting my vacation days if I can only log on for an hour or so before the servers crash over and over again.
---
1.12 is not the best patch of vanilla. and crbg's suck. ruins the spirit of vanilla. merging dead realms would be a preferred solution. But it doesnt make a lot of difference either way because no one is going to be playing battlegrounds in 1.12 as pvp gear is obsolete by that point. most servers die in aq patch anyway, most people won't even make it to the unbalance that is 1.12.
---
there's already a ton of changes, such as 1.12 skill trees. no changes doesn't mean follow every patch exactly, it means don't add things which were not in the game at all like crz, lfr etc.
---
I feel that way with some quest items. Most of them respawn instantly or very quickly. Then you have bingles tools. God damn I spent way too long there.
---
Around that level for alliance I would recommend Alterac and Arathi including Bay quests, and then the swamp of sorrows provided you teed up the right quests. You can head back to STV again at that point, around 40 👍
---
Hunter have the highest skill cap in the game.
---
I played alliance on a PvE server with a 70-30 alliance to horde ratio. My solo queues were 20-30 mins long and premade about 1hour to 1hour 30. I got to rank 12 and ran a premade full of high rankers. I also knew all the horde high rankers and we would have premade vs premade games everyday for fun.
---
Cross realm bgs pretty much killed my servers PvP scene. Sure, at the start, it was nice to have instant queues but then I never saw any of my servers horde players ever again. No more epic premade vs premade from our server. We used to world PvP between queues but that also died. You could never recognize anyone from the multiple other servers. There was no PvP community left. 
---
Kinda like LFG/LFR when you think about it. Yet, I see the same people that are against LFG/LFR also being for crossrealm bgs. I'll take a 1hour queue over crossrealm bgs any fucking day.
---
I bet she only dates guys over 6 feet tall.

This is actually the first WoW video I ever saw. Oh the memories.
---
I can easily live with the 50g cost, but the thing I hate the most is having to swap my talents/spellbars each respec.
---
Generally... yes. Nature's grasp is such an amazing tool to get that pesky melee of you, root a hunters pet and turn that 1v2 in your favor. Well worth losing a lil bit of stats over.
---
you can only switch weapons during combat. you must be out of combat to equip a trinket it has a 30s cooldown. so they have them equipped already. in vanilla pvp most players carry a lot of on use trinkets and swap them often.
---
\*burns through the current patch's entire content in 3 hours\*
---
Fuck, there's nothing to do. Guess I'll go one-shot raid bosses from when the game was better.
---
There's no sugar coating here, which is probably why you're getting down votes, but you're right. Gear lists like this go all the way back to vanilla if you looked hard enough for them.
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat
---
Which is not Vannila WoW. 
---
I don’t think your ideas are bad. It just is not Classic. You are describing a different game based in the Warcraft universe.
---
What the holy hell did I just read?
---
I’m so glad I’m not the only one who did this.
---
I'm not the guy you commented on, but the amount of work to get from rank 12 to rank 13 is massive. The investment to get to rank 12 is still pretty massive, but rank 13 and 14 are only achievable if you literally don't do anything else but play WoW. Rank 12 is probably the best you can achieve if you have a job with no other obligations.
---
Just seems like I’d stop at 10 over 12 to be honest with you.
---
You really don't need pre-raid BiS to do MC. Would highly suggest to kill as many non-boss's in MC while doing guild runs of ubrs, lbrs, etc...even horrible drops from MC are a huge upgrade.
---
lock is pretty easy too, but yeah id say hunter. shaman is difficult because you'll have like 7 in a raid.
---
its arguable. its the only profession I would consider pre-lvl 50, depends if you need gold. I won't be taking it as I will have enough for mount without it and don't need a lot of gold otherwise, but that is somewhat class dependent and if you make a lot of money in your leveling route.
---
I would also point out that the Scarlet Crusade had Monks that were fairly close (thought not an exact match) to the later Monk class from MoP.....
---
So it is in the right state to experience the real classic feeling ;)
---
PVE - damage - locks, healer - shaman, utility - hunters.
---
PVP:
---
Hunter - played it for a long time, so... Outside of the 8y deadzone, traps req macros (you can't cast them in combat), aspects switching req macros. Pets are a bit more retarded (at least for me, this apply to locks too). You will have to kite, A LOT! Not clipping outshots, stopping while kiting to cast autoshots. The burst damage is very good but you will have no way to regain mana, without potions. Pets req feeding, and if your pet dies it will probably start at 100% dmg, depend on how well was he fed. So if you are bm, you are losing some damage. Where engineering might be optional for most classes, you definitely want it for hunters or it will be non-stop purchasing of arrows/ammo at level 60.
---
Locks - spamming dots, running around and spamming even more dots. The other way to play them is casting soulfire (if I am not wrong about the name, having played lock in years) but it req soulshards, and they are boring to obtain. You can make a shit ton of HP and a lot of classes that rely on burst damage will struggle to kill you. Yet, you still have to deal with stupid pets. I always hated to play vs locks usually, if I kill them, I still might die...
---
Shamans - haven't played pvp with them outside enh, resto is probably decent, enh is waiting for WF and spamming slows on your target, but you haven't a very decent stun or any other CC effect. You will have to pay attention to the totems. Again you will req some macros for the totems, but definitely the weakest PVP class, if not resto, for me. But the totems are great in group combats where it is unlikely the totems to die on drop. Yet, if they keep killing ur mana regen totem, you will oom at some point without doing anything outside drop the totems again. But I still find enh shaman the most fun, if you are very lucky, you don't really need 3td hit with ur arcanite reaper.
---
Those are the ones that cause me to accept the rez sickness and just log off. It is a good incentive to take a break though lol.
---
I think the biggest challenge is, and always has been, getting 40 people together for 3 or 4 hours, a couple times a night. This will still be a challenge.
---
Well everyone has varying levels of goals and capabilities. I personally won't rank any kind of seriously, but I can see rank 12 being a goal for some people.
---
Princess drops a pre-raid bis ring for feral Druids... besides that idk
---
Years of theorycrafting that lead to things like feral druid DPS being way more widespread (and that's just a drop in the bucket), consumables usage is much more common and people don't have garbage PCs/internet anymore. More things likey keybinding/mouse turning etc. are also a lot more commonplace than they were during 2006. Itemizing correctly is also much more widespread. Pre-raid BiS lists are a thing instead of just stacking the dungeon sets.
---
The average skill level is higher, and the average performance level is through the roof. Even a braindead monkey will do crazy amounts of DPS if they're stacking every buff in the game (until they die to aggro/standing in bad, ofc).
---
On top of that, we're getting 1.12 talents and what will most likely be 1.12 itemization. Doing MC with those makes it much easier than it was at launch.
---
They were not player characters though. I am not saying what you want doesn’t fit with Warcraft lore, it clearly does. However, it isn’t the same game Classic is trying to recreate. The game you want sounds interesting, it just is a different game.
---
lol that grey shoulders
---
Yeah others have said it, but there will be less than a dozen people at 60 within the first 4 days. I’d bet less than 1000 in the first week. The vast majority will be hitting 60 after a month if they play a lot, 3-6 months for the more casual.
---
#WarlockMasterRace
---
Outside of leveling a good warlock usually beats a good rogue, and it only gets worse for the rogue as gear goes up.
---
Did crossrealm stuff exist in 1.7? No. Then we aren't getting them. 
---
One could argue that crossrealm and battlegrounds are two different issues. Either way, crossrealm bgs weren't part of classic for like 95% of it's lifetime. Having them from the start would be a pretty big change.
---
Well, considering Illidan is the last boss previous to Sunwell, if something is "around Sunwell", that's it.
---
There are some ranged weapons that make excellent stat-sticks as well.
---
If you think its ok for the hunter to grab a melee weapon to use as a stat stick, then i think the reverse must be true as well.
---
I'm sure there'll be plenty of both.
---
Finally someone who is consistent at least :)
---
I had a friend that grinded the tiger mount in WS, he started around 55. Took him a while but he got it!
---
I dont want her, you can have her, shes too fat for me
---
Is it weird that people want the best items in a game? How is this different from any other game? 
---
People want to do their best given the scenario they are focused on, one of the worst things in vanilla were people who had no clue what so ever, rolling on items that gave them no benefit, not pulling their weight or actively ruining groups because they didn’t bother to learn. 
---
It’s not like you need full BiS to even consider raiding, it’s something you work towards because it’s the best possible items at that stage, meaning you do your job a lot better than you would without those items.
---
A lot of good players take raiding for what it is in WoW classic, part of the game only. Many just raid to get gear to lengthen their e-peen in the world showing which faction is boss on the server.
---
A geared hunter is among the top wPvP and group PvP classes.
---
A geared hunter with the opener nukes 99% of his opponents.
---
feral is stronger on alliance in pve. very viable for 1 raid spot. not great on horde pve imo, resto better. guardian... doesn't exist. balance is pretty good in wpvp, useless in raid and bad in bg. most people run fc build in bg which is resto with feral charge. pure feral is strong in wpvp, not really ideal in premade bg composition, but its sort of workable. in general druid is more about playing the class than the spec in vanilla tbh
---
Fury warriors were the best melee dps spec in the game...?  The fuck you talking about non tank being trash?
---
The people who can accept that everything will take more time to achieve compared to retail will love it. Also people who don't like being depended on other people will have a harder time in retail.
---
Vanilla won't be for everyone and thats ok...
---
druid &gt; hunter &gt; shaman &gt; rogue/mage
---
I dont want a blue post. Just give me a realese date, and let me count the days like a child before christmas.
---
You literally don’t have to play with them. I never understood this complaint. They are so far removed from the vast population this should be a non issue.
---
Honor grind. Even if I don't participate, it changes the landscape of the game in a bad way. That's the only thing that really bothers me.
---
Ret is fun in vanilla, chill it. You won't DPS in raids but every other aspect of the game ret is viable and fun.
---
Ret in Scholo / Strat UD is a beast and fun to play as well.
---
N o c h a n g e s
---
Vanilla WoW is an experience and min/maxing ruins the game actually. So let the hardcore nerds that NEEDS to do it to get somewhere, worry about that.
---
Play Ret, just as I'll play a feral tank Druid and my friend will play a Shadow priest. We'll be a mismatched piece of shit guild but we'll have FUN
---
Its still pretty brainless. 
---
People who suddenly 'found' these 'challenging' content is people who are probably terrible at PVE. Not avoiding void zones, standing in fire, not interupting etc. 
---
A simple low mythic dungeon key could seem incredibly difficult to some people for example. 
---
If people want challenging content, its there. Mythic dungeon keys with alternating affixes exist. They change how the dungeon is done. You don't do massive pulls with Bolstering and Explosive for example (this week's affix). You need to kite for sanguin and grevious (last week's affix).
---
Both shaman and druid bring more to the table than DPS. Rogues and fury warriors are dead weight to be cut off if they dont perform. They have no other function in raids than 100% funneling as much DPS into the mob as they possibly can.
---
Obviously such a role in a raid will make people look at the only metric that justifies their existence in the raid.
---
The servers need little shitters to boss around take advantage of and take all their gold so yes.
---
Skinny legend! 🤤😩
---
Unfortunately boobs on a fat chick are like abs on a skinny dude. They don't count.
---
The entire premise of your argument is moot.
---
can you upload pic or vid of this rock los/safespot? I did the same thing, but ended up just kiting with spells instead because I couldnt figure out how to effectively do it in bear only
---
Fellow KT guy! I was Fale, a troll mage in The Brew Masters.
---
20-30k* but point is still valid, gap is getting bigger
---
Gear doesn't matter in timewalking. You can have a fresh dinged character and he'll be on about the equal standing as a Method world first player in terms of gear. Exception being some azerite gear advantage which is minimal due to how scaling works.
---
Where’s the rogue boah? Cool wallpapers!
---
I mean math is math. If you have a really good dps shaman pulling good numbers for their spec then that’s great and a nod to them. But top of the charts?  That just means every mage, warrior, rogue were trash. 
---
People always complain about everyone else’s attitude. They could say the same about you. 
---
Want to melee dps?  How about roll a warrior or rogue...don’t level a paladin to 60 knowing their dps is trash and you may be subjected to scrutiny for it because you refused to look at the math before hand and then bitch “elitism”. 
---
That’s stupid. 
---
If you want to dps as Ret because that’s what you want to do then that’s totally fine. There are plenty of guilds that will take you. But usually that’s not what happens. 
---
What happens is dick head McGee rolls ret and wants to be bleeding edge and then complains when the bleeding edge guilds won’t even consider him because playing ret, for example, is the total opposite of what that guild is trying to accomplish... 
---
If you’re worried about raid composition then I assure it’s a non issue. For the vast majority of guilds it won’t matter too much. Player attendance becomes more of an issue than the class/spec. 
---
Again, the people who complain and worry usually already know they are making a bad decision and try to deflect their own stupidity by blaming “elitists” ruining wow. 
---
Modern tools just provide a window into who is freeloading and who is not. 
---
Ironically those tools also shed light on the players who are performing well on off meta specs.
---
I remember a good bit of homogenization in Wrath. Giving formerly class-exclusive effects to more classes, and homogenizing buffs into categories.
---
I just started an orc warrior (lvl 10), my first time playing vanilla. Would you recommend me to get skinning on it and why? Other profession I have is first aid.
---
Naah, focusing on 3 chars and filling rest of the account (maybe 2 accounts) with mages and warlocks for moving around the map.
---
This is why I love internet sometimes.
---
They are weaker before they get shadow form but really most classes are pretty gimped before lvl 40 so it's not like they're odd in that way. Being able to heal is pretty awesome anyway so it's not all bad not having shadow form. Fear is a super strong CC against melee (as long as they aren't ud), and warriors don't even get beserker rage until they're 32. Hunter's are the main problem, but even they should be ok if you can run in and fear them, it's just if they start attacking at max range they'll kite you oom/dead pretty quick. If you're UD and have dev plague that's a pretty huge help against most classes (except paly/priest).
---
    
---
If you're really keen on levelling pvp i'd prob skip the (*uber pro reddit*) wand spec, those 5 points delay all your good shadow talents pretty badly and for a 5% or whatever dps increase it's probably not worth it compared to getting silence/shadow form many hours earlier if your goal is enjoying pvp.  
---
At 60 you do want some gear, but all you really need is +dmg and stam so gearing is very straightforward and just the good blues will make you super strong that makes you a strong force right through T1/2 epics stage.
---
race and item transmog addon will be the Trump election of vanilla that half of people secretly wanted.
---
Priests are decent levelers. Not the best and not the worst. Priests are strong PvPers because they can't outlast most classes. You're gonna have a hard time playing shadow PVE at 60 because of Mana issues.
---
For me, the biggest issue I have with classic are some of the questionable quest mechanics. 
---
That chest that only one person can loot at a time and takes 5-10 mins to respawn?  (I’m looking at you bingles’ Hammer) 
---
Even with sharding that will be insane. 
---
I understand the no changes but god damn that shit is going to be very annoying.
---
Highest skill is secondary.  Loyalty and dedication  should be the main factor in awarding the first couple bis loots.  Players with high skill tend to be selfish and not ready for the long haul of vanilla raiding.  Ive seen so many good players just get loot and quit or move guilds.  The ones that forge bonds with others and that care about the guild's longevity are the jewels you hold onto.  You are only giving bis loots to good players anyways, giving it to a 8/10 player that shows up, helps the guild outside of raid over a 10/10 skill player who just focuses on raidlogs.
---
What do warlocks farm?  
---
*Besides soulstones*.
---
Mages can also farm Hearthglen. It's usually highly contested though.
---
“Hey guys we’ve been wiping on this boss for 8 months...any ideas?” 
---
Guy with meters: “Well 25 of our dps have double digit dps...
---
*guild gkicks him*
---
In all seriousness - the only people who complain about meters are those that suck.
---
They wouldnt be able to get princess' design concept past the approval board in 2019 lofl
---
Now THAT is faction war at its finest.
---
I like that! I do miss the social aspect of pre-cata WoW. Even the few monthes I played BFA recently feels like mindset was almost tainted a little bit as far as not talking during runs and just mindlessly zombieing through content. I too am looking forward to helping other for sake of helping them and building relationships.
---
They needed to build a support organisation. Hire people.
---
Not always. But sometimes it works if the guild isnt too cliquey and biased towards 10 core people regardless of everyones performance.
---
If I could go back in time to me circa 2005 I would say to myself "Don't pick a warrior, pick the paladin or even the rogue. Warriors are shit at solo leveling."
---
I remember one time I was trying to level my warrior in some zone, I was like level 55-ish. I had to carefully, so carefully pull one mob at a time. If I pulled more than one I would have to pump all of my long cooldown skills to just barely survive only to basically stop questing for a half hour because I couldn't live through another encounter. 
---
Anyway, I'm doing my thing until I see a mage or maybe a warlock run through 20 mobs, gathering them all up. I stop to laugh at him cuz I expect he's about to get creamed... only for him to pop a few AoE spells and murder all the mobs at once. 
---
Now that I recall, I believe that may have been the moment I gave up on the game.
---
Damn, I guess I never traveled over into wow streaming. I’m glad I missed that bullet
---
This. Sorry bro
---
I averaged playing more than 10 hours a day and my first toon to 60 was at least 2 months in. Dont worry, just play and have fun.
---
Honestly with 2 weeks of staggered vaca, I'd still be happy hitting 60 in 4 weeks or so. I plan to play a lot, but not rush. Level professions, do dungeons, probably fish a bit...etc. Will be binge watching a few of my fav TV series and movies along the way.
---
The great thing about Classic is the servers are not going away and the content is rolling out in phases. You could start a year from now and find a guild spot doing whatever you want. As another post mentioned guilds constant recruit. Keeping 40man raid rosters is a lit of work. So always opportunities to join up.
---
Is there a resource anywhere of what it takes for each rank? Never paid much attention to pvp before
---
Oh yeah ofc, everyone will have full frost recist and 8 tanks ready to beat the 4 horse men in 1 try. The resistance alone will take weeks to farm lol. But yeah, day 1, keep dreaming lol
---
Yeah I was tired last night, I misread the "till" portion.
---
We'll see how it plays out on classic, but mage zg croc farm is probably the best there is once it's released. 
---
Strat live group runs can be lucrative too depending on what the real drop rates are.
---
I'm least excited for people who are going to ruin it. 
---
Bad attitudes.
---
And people who reserve gear in 5 mans shouldn't exist
---
Hemorrhage is decent for raiding.
---
You're not gunna use?! Just forge it and quit?!
---
Still not gonna happen
---
It's been a long time since I've played WoW, but I believe sharding is a portmanteu of two words. I don't know what those two words are. But the idea is to have zones behave like instances of dungeons so that individual players have an opportunity to complete quest objectives. There may be 1200 people playing in that one zone but that one zone has 12 copies running so only 100 players are in each copy.
---
Rather people like being carried by some people and hiding it. If you would use a dpsmeter you would probably see it's not a team effort.
---
The troll is strong with this one
---
And the mandatory "private server" comment, ofc.
---
Yeah classic will be close to pserver wow, except the code and mechanics ain't scuffed to oblivion. And world buffs having a server wide CD which is missing on pservers. And black lotus having a 6 min respawn. Yeah, that will happen...
---
OR, could it be that people are not going to have full world buffs, flasks and consumables because it was almost impossible to have that in vanilla and private servera just messed that up?
---
LOL I didn't even see this thanks for sharing. I had made the video they are talking about
---
Last time i checked Feral druids where the king at tanking patchwerk in naxx, but keep the meme up
---
Forgot about the ZG crocs, thanks
---
+ those packs have some mobs which put a -50% debuff on armor (main stat of ferals)
---
Rep grinding main factions can save you a cool 100g on your epic mount. Not to mention discounts at your favorite vendor. Orgrimmar discounts if you hang out in Org all day, etc. If you're looking for rep along the way, keep those in mind.
---
I’m a teacher so I hope it comes out before my vacation (I’m off when the kids are off. I don’t get to choose when)
---
Umm.. thanks!.. i really didn’t need this in my life
---
have fun killing  20000 boars in a couple months
---
This also really does scare me. Like you said we "veterans", players who are looking pretty harsh world are minority. My biggest fear is that complain is so hard that Blizzard bends and starts to make things easier.
---
Safest way to do it is everyone need on it. If im playing with friends/guildies, then its MS&gt;greed.
---
And only way to do that is play on private servers atm.
---
Not sure why casuals should be worried. Going to take 3 to 6+ months for them to 60. Why would they worry where they end up in the first few days. Frankly, if I was going casual, I'd probably wait a few days to start playing and avoid the hassle.
---
People are saying that leveling a priest is efficient but boring and they are right! But you can make leveling more interactive and efficient by weaving in auto attacks with a slow, hard hitting staff between wand shots. This is because your melee and ranged attacks are on different timers. With a really slow staff you would Melee &gt; Wand &gt; Wand &gt; Melee &gt; Wand &gt; Wand etc. You don't NEED to do this if you don't want to, Priest is still extremely efficient with just wanding.
---
You know Classic has a 2 to 6-7 years lifespan anyway right? 
---
I mean, I guess many here are down to play the same 2 years of content forever but to claim that Classic is immortal is simply wrong.
---
Now that I read your post better... Were you sarcastic?
---
I pulled the named dino from Un'goro (King whoever) to the gates of orgrimmar. He didn't make it very far inside before the locals took notice.
---
I will!
---
I know warrior has at least one quest where there's a choice between a set of shoulders, a trinket and something else. The shoulders are good but easily replaced. The trinket is like BiS through BWL, so there's definitely a few quest rewards you need to choose correctly on. I'd advise consulting some type of gearing guide of BiS list for your class so you don't choose incorrectly on these.
---
What's a zoomer?
---
Just to give a different perspective. 
---
2) Don't pick the Warrior if you plan to level alone. Warrior needs good gear to level, requires lots of gold due to repairs, has no self healing abilities in vanilla beyond potions or bandages. 
---
3) I played Alliance. The Human starting zone was well set up and it was a natural progression as you quested up into Stormwind City. From there you could head south into Westfall which will have you progress to level 20 and then you can start doing dungeons. The Dark Elf starting zone was much more spread out and was more difficult to navigate as well as the Dark Elf city was way more spread out compared to the other Alliance hubs.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0)
---
I remember there being a decent amount of people from Singapore on Mal'Ganis. Had one in my guild who got rank 14.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_of_Aquementas
---
This is one.
---
You can either get this item, or the Linken's Sword of Mastery. So obviously you *REALLY* want to get the sword, but the Spirit is dope - basically pre-raid bis.
---
6. Wool farm
---
7. Elemental fire before MC becomes a thing
---
and likely few other similar quasi-farms.
---
For alliance maybe. Horde can start going in RFC at 13-18.
---
I think think there are a few reasons so many people are talking about BiS lists now. One is the hype: people can’t play the game now, but we know all the loot tables, so people can plan/fantasize. Second is it’s more interesting: All the gear isn’t just from one raid. Lion-heart helm is BiS for warriors for the whole game. Robe of volatile power is BiS for fire mages until Naxx. And lots of lists do have multiple options.
---
I don’t think anyone really expects a full raid of 40 people to have BiS gear before attempting MC and if they do they don’t really know anything about vanilla.
---
Another thing to think about is that loot was scarce in vanilla. Molten core has 10 bosses dropping 2-3 epics. Not everyone in your raid will be getting an epic every week. It would be helpful to know what items to prioritize with dkp and what upgrades you can find outside of raids.
---
I hope they restore this mechanic
---
What’s the wool farm??
---
Misfits with Danzig/Only/Wolf are playing ONE show in Los Angeles...June this year.....
---
Misfits with Danzig/Only/Wolfgang are playing ONE show this year in June...Los Angeles area.....
---
You got the banking backwards by the way. It was definitely the alliance who yanked the memorial. 
---
And it was an asshole thing to do. I don’t agree with what they did, but they were well within their rights to do so. It was in a PvP zone on a PvP server. They could have held it in a capital city or something.
---
this is the Diamond flask which unless they release the Sunken Temple class quests early will probably not be available till a later phase I would guess since they weren't introduced till after ZG in original.
---
I'm a Night Elf Mohawk
---
You know, I probably should have complained a little less, lol.  Indeed, the implementation was for both gameplay and roleplay reasons, which is perfect for an RPG, so I get that, and I love when games blend both sides.
---
The problem is it was just so ridiculously heavy-handed.  People may have forgotten that if your rank was high enough (around 10, I think), a single DHK could reduce your rank the next week by literally two, maybe three with 2 DHKs.  I don't know what the exact formula was, but the reason it was so **EXTREMELY** brutal is because each DHK reduced your progress to the next rank by some amount instead of a set amount of Honor, and the entire Honor Ranking system is a ladder system, which naturally inflates the amount of Honor needed to rank based on how many people participate and how active they are.
---
To be fair, it does make good RP sense that highly honorable people should be like role models of a sort and thus should be judged more harshly, but it was just too overboard is all.  The problem really lies in the fact it's all a ladder system, but then again, that's why it was removed in TBC.
---
All this said, now that I think about it, if making civilians uninteractible isn't an option, I don't know if it's better to have DHKs or not.  I feel like modern internet culture will bring out more and worse asshole-ish behavior than *ever* before, that several people are going to want to be an "Angwe" and worse.  But maybe I'm just being too pessimistic.
---
Eh, whatever.  I don't even like WoW PVP.  I think it's just silly stuff, but it's fun enough that I'm not going to discredit those that earnestly enjoy it.
---
Frost mages can still aoe a whole ton of mobs in vanilla.
---
Clear every raid every phase.
---
Did someone say \[Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian\]?
---
&gt; The "but server community" is just such an incredibly weak defense   
---
Uhm no. It is not. Thats something many people miss the most about classic. crbg is a bandaid fix to a problem that was only "solved" by introducing sharding. The solution that does not fiddle with Vanilla design philosophy is merging servers
---
What he is getting at is that at Classic's launch and for the early phrases, cross realm BGs wont be necessary. Queues wont be too long and people want to have the feeling of being able to recognize people in BGs.
---
Once Phase 6 or arguably as early as Phase 5 comes around, Classic will lose some subs, servers become more imbalanced, we will know whether BC servers are going to be a thing, and cross realm BGs will very much be a necessary evil. Especially if/when BC servers release.
---
I'm the SCAT MAN!
---
Most guilds aren't that intense about pre-bis but if you can dungeon farm it or rep farm it you better believe you'll be low prio for loot in a loot council guild if you don't bother and someone else does.
---
I would take the sword every time over some offhand I am going to replace.
---
In Vanilla there weren't as many alternative options for BIS it was either the right item for that slot or trash most of the time. So there wasn't nearly as deep of a priority list for each slot - especially early on.
---
I believed the problem was the distribution, they had to make sure it was available in all of Europe on the same day.
---
Nope, I just hope they are not all dps....
---
Ally has no duels, never seen any duels there after vanilla, even on the shall not be named servers.
---
Neat post, but it's Iao Needle, not Lao Needle.
---
I think warrior is pretty basic. you do mortal strike in pvp, and fury in pve. if you want to break away from that, you are gimping yourself a lot.
---
Well...its called Vanilla/Classic WoW for a reason. Nothing else to add.
---
I'm on team graphics changes. 
---
I want classic gameplay with the modern graphics engine. I've yet to hear a reason not to have modern graphics that I agreed with.
---
As a healer you don't replace this offhand until after the itemization update with the DM release patch which changes the offhand from reducing mana cost of skills to increasing spell power... so it's worth getting as a healer as it lasts for quite sometime.
---
Lol
---
what are the options for phase 1 thats fairly easy and decent gold per hour?
---
i know during vanilla on my lock i did some farming at tyr's hand, think a friend told me they farm there
---
I will likely have an alt.  On a separate server and faction with some friends.  
---
If I need a second character it's usage will be limited as I plan to experience all the content on my main.  If I try to engage in an alt that is less time I could use to farm rep or materials.
---
you can twist grace of air totem with WF for the best of both worlds with a decent shaman, but most people prefer to twist with GoA for even more DPS.
---
They’re great with a blackout and psychic scream early and burst from mind blast. 
---
I disagree with the other commenter and encourage you to go wand spec and get spirit tap for your first talents. This will make it easier to keep your mana high when leveling incase you get jumped and just make your leveling experience smoother. World pvp is seldom a fair fight and I think it pays more to be ready for anything than to be totally optimized for a duel. 
---
I hope you go undead for devouring plague!!
---
I wouldn't consider Classic "beat" unless I have a full set of T3 and at least one legendary weapon. I'm not dedicated/crazy enough to go for R14 and I highly doubt I'll even have a *chance* at the Scarab Lord title and mount.
---
Lol who wants a green mh 1.8 sword anyway?
---
I think they are saying "because of DHKs, people trying to rank up will stay in BGs and not raid cities". And "in a world with DHKs you still get some people who don't care about honour who will still be ganking quest givers".
---
I think these people are basically right that DHKs fail to do much solve the problem they are meant to solve (quest giver ganking), and unduly punish people who join a raid to do world PvP. If people ganking quest givers is a problem some other solution would be better.
---
Killing a fully world buffed guy from the servers top guild is going to be fun.
---
Orb of Dar Orahil for Locks, the staff seems better at the level you get it, but the orb is useable much longer than the staff and is very hard to replace (the staff is ok but dungeon drops in the 40 range can replace it).
---
Crescent. Staff. If you’re horde, and you are not a rogue or hunter, this item is straight godly. It’s extremely hard to replace for casters, and even warriors can use the fat stack of stam and spirit combined with an impressive damage amount.
---
The level 50 class quests, in general, offer the same three items. A terrible one, one that is amazing for the level but easily replaced later, and a gimmicky one that always is useful, but is never that great.
---
I thought i had it all planned out.. the class.. the spec.. the professions.. And now you remind me of the fact that i can't just create enchants and throw them to ah ? JFC...
---
As a tank you will take the stalwart belt from a quest in Burning Steps... I believe the quest to kill incideous in BRD gives it as the reward... best preraid tanking belt and lasts until Belt of Might.
---
As a DPS you take the +2% hit shoulders from the baelgor quest in burning steps as well as these are only replaced by true strike from UBRS.
---
Spirit of Aquamentous as mentioned is worth taking as a healer and sometimes a caster DPS until the DM/MC itemization patch which changes the item from reducing the mana cost of skills to increasing healing/spell power (might be just spell power)
---
These are the main 3 that come to mind... but I am sure there are more that I cant quite remember
---
I'd sell that on the AH.
---
From my experience in Vanilla and some P-Servers: don't rush. Enjoy it. Lots of players will not even hit 60 before they stop playing. Even if you hit 60 after 6 months you will be fine. Don't let yourself get stressed out over hardcore players who nolife 18h/day :)
---
Yeah the ST Class Quests all have 1 really good reward that you should take but this isn't introduced into the game until ZG/after ZG
---
So BiS for PvP
---
This is exactly why I will take my vacation exactly 1 week after launch.
---
What a great reply this is 😋
---
WoW2 is what you are looking for.  Hell I would love it as well, but classic is about recreating the game that launched a cultural phenomenon.
---
I often think about how awesome classic would be with some of the more useful features of current wow like guild banks, but that isn't what literally hundreds of thousands of players or petition signatures asked for.
---
In the end I'm fine with the game as is.  Compared to the trash studios are putting out now the game has more than enough value in itself.
---
&gt; The "but server community" is just such an incredibly weak defense unless you played on a balanced server and don't know any better
---
No, it isn't. I still remember levelling my Shaman in vanilla and taking him up through each PvP bracket, and the rivalries I built with Alliance as we all came up together. We'd see eachother out in the world and either /wave or have a respectful 1v1 fight. You'd see a dude you knew from one of the big guilds and shit your pants.
---
Every QOL feature has its cost, and each one adds up to what got us to retail today.
---
Even as someone that enjoys PvP, I would personally take 20 minute queues over CRBGs any day.
---
Chances are I won't even be forging it for myself.
---
Honestly nothing will beat Hunter Tribute runs... ZG crocs are nice but that is a few months into release... by that time if you are a mage you have farmed enough gold in DMN or Hearthglen... DME jump runs are a solid as well.
---
Everyone needs. 
---
Unless it's epic that is suitable for your class.
---
In this case you can try and convince others to let you have it.
---
But it’s A E S T H E T I C!
---
Dkp &gt; Lootcounsil in a casual or semi hardcore envoirement. There goes alot of fun into collecting and after a while being able to spend these points you worked for. Lootcounsil works in guilds where everyone stands behind there officer choises but out of the 40 guys in your group. There will be people dissagreing. You cannot argue with DKP.
---
Dkp is the "save" pick.
---
ZG you need to run a LOT. AQ20 is a lot less important to most ppl, it only has the skill upgrade books that everyone needs and top of that only FEW actual item upgrades. In ZG you have the best heal neck at that stage, very good heal mace, BIS (through all content) hpala gloves, enchants, mats for the at that stage BIS bloodvine stuff, rep shoulder enchants and zanza potions, hakkar head for world buff and MOUNTS.
---
AQ20 books become relatively cheap pretty damn fast, so you actually could totally skip it. But there are some good items and healers might want the last boss head q neck. So id say ppl run AQ20 for a while, but nearly as much as ZG.
---
As these have faster ID CD's, you tend to run a lot of these anyways, so getting the gear isnt the main focus later on. Its the hakkar head buffs, bijous/coins for zanza potion and ZG enchants that are important even if you do naxx.
---
Yeah the griffin mount on his toolbar too.
---
I'm sorry but no. Just no. PServers are a joke because they didnt get key things like armor, spell resistance, buff/debuff interactions, proc rates, and npc abilities correct. By there own admission they had no clue to any of that and had to guess.
---
Also you are being delusionaly elitist if you think vanilla was full of nothing but keyboard turning scrubs who didnt know what consumables were. Also go check the release schedule,  they clearly stated we arent getting 1.12 itemization
---
I expect we'll have regional servers though, so if you're in Europe or Oceania you should have short queue times in your peak still.
---
Anyone else thought this was a bit fucked up as they got older?
---
Context is important.  Cross-realm BGs were introduced to solve queue problems.  It stands to reason that if queues become problems then cross-realm BGs will probably need to be a thing.
---
The only questions I have about it is what circumstances will warrant it, and what is the plan.  Hopefully blizz might add some clarity on that eventually.
---
Stockades maybe?
---
I switched to mage in WoTLK and wished I had played one all along. They aren't as easy to level as some classes in Vanilla, being very squishy and hard to WPvP at lower levels. That being said, it's fairly easy to get a group, since you provide water/CC, which really boosts your group speed (unless your healer is ok with using purchased water, which some can't afford unless they have a "main" - and nobody will have that at launch).  
---
If you want to go with a mage, do a little research and study out what you want to do - it's pretty simple, and you can have a lot of fun with it if played right. But it's also one of those classes all the min/max people seem to know so well, yet there's a massive difference between min/max players and those purely playing the class... because even if someone "tops the dps charts" - there's sooooooo much more to it than just blowing things up, if played right.  
---
For instance, one of my favorite things to do would be to answer a post of "damage done" IF I got beat (which was rare in Wotlk) with "damage taken" - which I nearly always was at the bottom, with the exception of fights in which random players are attacked. The point being that you can nearly always mitigate or avoid any kind of damage received in PvE. Play your cards right, and you can find little intricacies that make playing the class almost unfair when compared to other classes.  
---
But don't let me ruin the fun of discovery! It's best when you find them yourself! =D
---
Naxx was probably harder at 70 than the first few TBC raids
---
It will take most people around 40-60 days playing 20+ hours a week to hit level 60. Then probably another 2 months to get decent enough gear to get into MC. The world record pace is 116 hours to level 60 on a hunter. So if you did nothing but grind on a strict 20 hours/week (160 hrs total) it would take the average player about 2 months to level cap, varying widely based on focus/class/server conditions.
---
Depends on what you want to do tbh.
---
Doesn’t the boomerang just come anyway?
---
pfUI, pfQuest, Luna, aux, bigwigs and KTM for tanks/dps.
---
Much more difficult and things will seem broken. However, it’s more rewarding. Every level feels like an accomplishment. If you hate levelling you’ll hate the game.
---
yeah I mean when I was ranking one of my friends got r13 with a fulltime job. but it was a real struggle I would not recommend, his last 2 weeks were vacation time 1 week, sleepless 1 week with friends helping as much as we could. another friend got r12 fairly comfortably (albeit with 0 social life or free time outside of work wow eat sleep.. but at least he slept etc). I personally would just get r10 if I had a 9-5 job then do some raiding for t2, seems a lot smarter.
---
level 44 yet only 20 defence?
---
I think people are a little paranoid about #nochanges, but it is important cause making changes is how we got to BFA. 
---
I wouldn’t say you’re bad, but just recognize that’s not going to happen. I wish more tank specs were viable, but if they were then it wouldn’t really be classic. You like pandas? I hate pandas. I’m really looking forward to playing in a world without them.
---
Classic is coming because enough people came together around a single vision. Yeah there things that could be improved, but everyone has different views on what they are. Try to enjoy the game for what it is.
---
Twisting the totem is not worth the loss of healing unless you are in a fight that is low on healing in which case squeezing out that bit extra DPS is not necessary. On a close fight if there is more healing the tanks will stay alive longer and less DPS'er will die making the likely success of the fight far higher than a gimmick to allow 4 players to grow their e-pen's.
---
On top of that the totem is party wide and not all of the raid can be given it unless you have 7 shamans (clearly if there is a shaman in the tank group they would not use tranquil air). The flat boost of the blessing buffs and the raid wide nature of the blessings is far superior. Add to that the greater healing per mana a paladin has and the increasing sustain they get as they get more spell crit the overall effect of paladin in a raid over a shaman is overwhelming.
---
ud are the jiggliest though
---
Good question
---
Good answer
---
Rush my main till 60, gear up and get raid ready with my other hardcore guildies. Once raid ready start collecting some gold. When my main feels prepared for raids...
---
Ill level 6 or 7 chars simultaneously by leveling only when rested.
---
Nope. I've gone the opposite. It was fair game.
---
Def need me some healbot. its saved my life so many times being able to keep HoTs up party/raidwide
---
It's really the best weapon for dps and tank even at 60 with the use charge. Until you get aq40 mace you will need to farm this Always as a feral.... for tanking this is THE best tps weapon in game even at 60.
---
Check out here: https://discord.gg/cNCEcz4
---
No. Don't do it in a PvP zone on a PvP server
---
I’ll be in my bunk
---
Shaman.
---
i sant instant queues 24/7 you need cross server bg's for that
---
^TM
---
Yep. And none of them will tank is K3 is anything to go by
---
I lol’d
---
None of them will tank.
---
If I remember correctly rogues were far and away the most popular on my server in vanilla.
---
Private servers see a lot of warriors though, and it will be interesting to see if that dynamic carries over to classic.  Some private server people might roll warrior only to find it more difficult to play.
---
...but it worked
---
Lol, I would loose my mind.
---
People will still be doing BGs, because they are fun. A very small minority are actually chasing anything beyond perhaps rank 10 gear and BG rewards,  most do BGs for fun.
---
it should be coded in a way that it is technically possible to do, but very hard to execute.  this way only very dedicated hunters can do it with lots of practice , and not everybody.  I think it will be a rare event in this scenario.
---
There's going to be way less consumes due to there being no increased respawn times. Herb price will be far too high for the same level of pserver usage. World buffs also don't work all correctly in pservers, in Classic they aren't going to be as easily gained. That's just for consumables.
---
yes, however he would never die because he would heal himself to 100% all  the time
---
Save a 100k subs??? Do you honestly think that this event made anyone quit the game (or reconsider their decision to sub)?
---
...I shouldn't laugh, but I did
---
If you have friends, Shaman.  
---
If you're forever alone and need to stealth away from danger, druid
---
I work on similar stuff at my job, so I immediately thought about that :)
---
We don't even know how instance farming is going to work in classic yet
---
They drop some really good stuff. They pretty much invalidate most of Molten Core and there are a few pieces in particular that could stay with you for the life of the game.
---
ZG in particular will never get old because of the enchants. Everyone needs to enchant their helm + legs, but you only get 2 enchants per 20 players. ZG resets every 3 days. At bare minimum, you're looking at 60 days for an entire 20-man raid to enchant their helm and legs. And that's not counting classes that have multiple sets of gear that need to be enchanted.
---
...long live private servers =(

I am pretty sure these patches are allready active as we will have 1.12.
---
Pfft! Ezra Chatterton didn’t even visit Blizzard until months after TBC’s launch. If you wanna find his dawg so bad, either play retail or wait for the TBC reissue.
---
Exactly. And thanks to the both of you for recognizing the good, instead of focusing on the drama. Ya'll should take over as mainstream media so we can get some good news once in awhile.
---
Warriors didn't at all. Just hard time leveling. Paladins shamans druids I believe we're the worst
---
Did... Did you never do BRD or just forgot about it? 😅
---
As a Druid player, if you're not bleeding-heart passionate and willing to give it 110% just to still fall behind people in both PvP and PvE who are clearly worse than you... pick the other class you're considering for a main.  It's really hard to recommend Druid to anyone that is competitive and wants to "win."  
---
I chose Druid for the ability to dodge fights in stealth, to run lowbies through dungeons as a bear, and for roleplaying class fantasy.  If you can't make a list of things that hit you in the feels then you won't buy too much into it.
---
Make an alt Druid down the line if you're still feeling like Shaman isn't satisfying your hybridness itch.
---
...and it would be trump's fault
---
• Exalted with all Horde factions (gonna be maining Horde this time around)
---
• BiS PvE gear on at least my main
---
• 10k gold (never farmed gold in vanilla, but had over 20k gold in wrath)
---
• At least 3 rare mounts and 3 rare pets
---
• Both professions at max level (not sure which ones yet)
---
• Cooking and Fishing professions at max level
---
That's about it.
---
When wow came out I was an edgy teenager so obviously my first char was an UD rogue. I would camp escort quests and ruin it just before the end. Dousche Deluxe.
---
Its really not. Human are the choice of most hc guilds as MT and OT usually. Just cuz of the hit, although you really need 9% hit with gear anyhow since BT/slam don't go on your racial 305skill and thats just for glancing and increase of your tps.
---
Since you need 9% from gear anyhow dwarf nor  gnome doesnt really matter. BUT, in a hc guild when min/max is everything you'd probably aint going to tank if you choose any other race than Human, if your not trustworthy of your earlier accomplishment.
---
NE is sick cus of the 1% extra dodge for fury tank dw tps build, (extreme hardcore guilds only)
---
As always I will start by saying, yes. I am just going to have a main as I do not have the time for more.
---
After a year you will find I have six different &lt;60 level characters and another three that got to 20-40 and then got deleted. 
---
I am not good at resisting the urge to make alts.
---
Nah I'm past that angsty teen stage of wanting to absolutely pwn everyone and show dominance. I just don't want to be steamrolled at all stages of the game though. Plus classic won't really be that competitive, nothing's ranked as far as I know etc.
---
if you get a gear that requires rank 12 and if you derank to rank 11 will you still be able to use that gear?
---
Many spots can be used like Stockades, dwarfs in southern barrens etc. The unusual thing is that it us a low level resource needed for many thins yet in little supply - to low level to get caught in aoe exp farming or spread across to little levels to get enough while leveling.
---
Oh my god, where did you take that photo of my girfriend in her bikini?
---
I'm GM for a guild that have been raiding on a private server that should not be named since the server release. Currently in AQ patch and we have cleared all content.
---
We use DKP och manage it through google docs, works very well. But we will for sure use Loot Council in classic. You will probably want the same thing after a few months of raiding with DKP.
---
After all the grief horde caused me in vanilla. After all the hours of griefing. After all the time spent waiting for a countdown timer just to rez, run 30' and be camped again. I'm ready for payback. Hope ya'll can handle it, 'cause it's going to be ruthless. Just as ruthless as I received, and every bit more I can give. I could only HOPE another memorial happens on my server, in a WPvP zone. If I'm the only one to crash it, I'll be there to wreak havoc. Count on it. I'm coming for blood, and I won't stop until I'm satisfied.
---
Well, mages should do DMN+DME before reseting (unless you get mass ganked in DM area).
---
Ignorance at its finest.
---
This is still a thing in retail
---
Wait wait wait... Do keys take inv space or are Keychains in from start???
---
OH MY GOD!
---
I'll have a main and then eventually a 19 twink. I don't think i'd have time for more
---
Thralls BALLS we need a release date!
---
Can you let me know your ingame name just so I can avoid your groups?
---
Same. Especially after all the non-stop horde ganking/griefing ever since the very first release day... they honestly brought this on themselves.
---
I don't even know what versatility is, and to be honest, I don't want to know.
---
We are talking about levels 10 to 19. You wont even see another faction in most cases before having points in both. And low level normal regen is quite high, so wand spec makes more sense because you regen fast regardless in the 10-14 range.
---
Lifetap is bad for GCD management
---
for me leveling is by far the worst part of making an alt. yea pre-raid bis sucks a little but its nothing vs 1-60. attunement is ez, and plus u don't even have to do it on an alt who cares about ony? casual raiding for gear is pretty easy, but u also don't need to go past pre-bis to have a great farming alt so theres no pressure.
---
Oh yeah, but the whole dungeon thing was AMAZING! I ran that place hundreds of times!
---
It's more likely that they'll fix gold run exploits (ie dire maul tribute runs) and BG exploits (wall-jumping WSG flag off-map)  
---
People will be pissed if they smooth out the vanilla talents
---
The epicness of entering BRD at lvl55 with a group of random players and then clearing the entire place in 6 hours having made 4 new friends.
---
It was like being inside the lord of the rings and having gotten thru the mines of Moria.
---
Enjoy having to drink twicevl to fill all mana
---
I was under the impression it started at 58. Pretty cool if you can do it earlier.
---
It was cross battlegroup not cross all really so it's not as bad
---
I was on EU-Spinebreaker, a low population realm that was 95% horde 5% alliance. And I loved to do BGs. I don't think I would have EVER popped a BG.
---
Afterwards, I moved to EU-Stormscale which is where my friends were. Also 95% horde 5% alliance. Unless they fix these server imbalances, BGs will never work (and low level PvP will be non-existent)
---
Forever immortalized by thousands of people around the world.
---
Get ready to only heal in raids with 9 other paladins, and not be allowed to roll on 2-handers
---
Hmm, you can really make good gold/hr farming wool? Like on par with DM- E?

Thank you!
---
I never played more than one character actively in vanilla. Maybe here and there a bit of twinking, but i never get past lvl 30 on a second character.
---
One character alone is absurdly time consuming. I don't understand how someone can find the time to get to 60 multiple times, except playing is all they do.
---
But still then it's crazy how people can stay motivated.
---
Ohhhh, is that only availible to engineers? I never even knew this existed.
---
Well, you got dots and fear, mindflay to slow ppl down. Not having shadowform gives you ability to HEAL yourself. So having that renew ticking in combination with a shield... its nice. Getting silence at L30 helps a ton.
---
You will be fine in 1:1. In vanilla its mostly about who gets the jump on the other guy and how low were you fighting that mob. Because they wont attack you solo.
---
I remember when new models dropped hearing a lot of complaints about this "nerf". This post hath slain me. Rest in power, killed by the tiddie.
---
Sating pvp gear is obsolete by that point is like saying MC/BWL gear is obsolete as well. So no reason to raid there, go straight for aq40 on your freshly dinged 60.

&lt;Dominatus&gt; \[OCEANIC\] \[HORDE\] \[PVP\]
---
Time Zone: GMT+11
---
Raid times: Starting from 10:00pm GMT+11 (days per week TBA)
---
Goals: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
Loot: EPGP (Details TBA)
---
Contact: [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX)
---
Guild info: Dominatus will be a late-night, semi-hardcore guild with a no-dickhead policy. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+11 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
Applicants: Anyone can apply, the levelling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).

I think you get the boomerang either way.

Thats where you'r wrong because in any Good guild usually all other warrior Will help you stack sunder at start so the tank can focus on the real threat abilitys such as slam/bt Revenge.

I played on a Great pvp server with good faction balance and high pop.

The pvp community was amazing and xr ruined it completely.

You having your own experience doesnt make ours invalid.

Zero sum dkp is best dkp.  Everyone gets their shot at loot if they are there when their 'turn' comes around

---
The "unobtainable" content for me. I work a 40+hr/week job and have a kid. I'll be able to probably do some end game raiding and rank up in pvp a bit, but I'll probably never be able to do Naxx (maybe after a good while after it's been out, maybe) and I'll never be rank 14 (which i guess isn't really "content" but it's still unobtainable).
---
That would make me want it less, the item changes your playstyle heavily and is more or less phased out, I always thought of gear and progression leading you in one direction not a scattered up and down. Just my personal taste though, also the dm patch won't be THAT far off.
---
Ah yeah that's how it works.
---
Oof, the irony.
---
Eh, we didn't get a non-combat rez until...wrath? And hell, trees ran at 40% reduced speed in BC, which is arguably even worse, but I never saw groups not want them. Innervate, brez, roots, mark...all too valuable in a lot of situations. Druids were excellent vanilla healers so long as you knew where and when to rank down.
---
Princess run is one my favorite dungeons ever, it’s so beautiful and fun!
---
If you can collect scourgestones from the start then you should get Argent Dawn Commission trinket when u grind Plaguelands and scholo/strat for scourgestones/rep. Also do quest so you can get item that let's you get items from Plaguelands ( for cauldron turn ins )
---
Yeah, r10 is good enough. Lol
---
Hey mate,

Can you update Dominatus to have  **Kaizer**\#9729  as the GM name so it includes my discord tag, and add [https://discord.gg/4zkesU](https://discord.gg/4zkesU) to the discord field.
---
Very nice work, cheers!
---
Vanilla had Battlegroups, not Cross-Realm BGs. Specific servers were linked for the purpose of BGs, in retail you can be matched with anyone in your license region. Much smaller in scope compared to retail.
---
No one on earth is going to skip raiding Mc, just because they don't have all their pre Bis gear.
---
That is not the point of the list.
---
Did you really think that?!?
---
When I started reading, I thought you were talking about strategic starting location of undead, or something similar.
---
Hi guys!
---
I have grossly misunderstood a concept because I haven't done any research and jumped to conclusions. In my imagined world, everyone is acting like an idiot. Why is that?
---
Does anyone have any insight on this?
---
This shit is an absurdity and bothers the crap out of me on pservers.  Your time is just as valuable to you as mine is to me.  If we both need [x] and we're both actively participating in the group, we both get  a shot.
---
I hate that this will become common practice in classic, and im so glad I have 3 others coming with me so we cab strongarm this shit out of our groups.
---
BIS lists were omnipresent in raiding guilds and guides until Cata. Reforging made the concept very less interesting and War/Titanforging completely annihilated it. Before that BIS lists were both a goal for individual players to strife for as well as a tool for guilds to decide who gets what loot.   
---
Pre Raid BIS was pretty much a Vanilla thing. In TBC gear was a lot more streamlined and entry level raids like Karazha were easily accessible. Add token gear into the mix and there really was no point to have pre raid bis. Just grab some gear and start from there.
---
How do you download these? I have no idea how to use steam stuff.
---
it's good gold/h
---
I don't think you lose your rewards, but I never really PvP'd in classic. I don't think maintaining your rank is necessary unless you want to keep ranking or for gloating reasons. I guess if you keep a premade going you could block other people from getting rank 13/14 but once people reach their goal rank and know that they aren't going to/can't rank any higher they stop because it just isn't feasible to keep up that level of play/endurance for too long.
---
Sometimes wool is the most expensive cloth on AH and it sells. As a max or close level you are very unlikely to die farming it nor do you need dm released. It's a matter if you want to relax given farm day or not :) also materials from dm can loose a lot of value when 90% of the server is farming there. Vendor farm ;)
---
Eh did you play Vanilla?  A reputation became a thing on servers and you'd get passed up for groups, abd definitely passed up for raiding guilds if they thought you'd bring that 'i need it' attitude to a raid.
---
You've commited a sacreliege by comparing such casual, nostalgic, romantic, warm-feeling Elwynn Forest, to that magical, mystical-looking lake.
---
ele/resto is definitely a more 'standard' spec. It works and you will be wanted in premades/bgs. balance/resto is pretty unproven. It's definitely ok/fun if you have good gear and the enemy doesn't, but whether it actually brings anything to the table or is really competent for end game pvp remains to be seen. Relying on cloth gear at low levels and really anything pre AQ40 just means you'll get destroyed by any physical dps that sneezes on you.  
---
Unless you really want to be a flag carrier wsg superstar (ie run away and hide from fighting 24/7) than it's hard to recommend druid for pvp.
---
Not possible.
---
Finally OC content.

oh god

Alliance has better lore what

I can't think of a threat sensitive fight where healing is an issue - generally twisting is just done to clear the boss faster because DPS don't have to hold back as much.

Elemental fire won’t be as $ as on pserver early patches as the Heart of fire transmute to a few elemental fires will probs be in with the 1.12 professions alchemy

Not picking Omokk's Girth Restrainer as a Fury Warrior from the introductory UBRS quest is a pretty big mistake. You don't replace that belt until Onslaught Girdle.

All need

Wasn't it battlegroups? Like, 5-6 servers in a pool and you only meet people from the same servers?

Read: non-warrior tank
---
He’s saying that druids and paladins are bad tanks.
---
I definitely wont actively play more than one before phase 6 hits, as my goal is to keep up as well as possible. Once phase 6 is there and the game goes into idle mode I will start making all kinds of charakters
---
Same.  Why i love playing priest.  Everyone wants to party with the healer!  Make lots of friends quickly.
---
I also will take TWO weeks off for wow classic launch. I would rather save my money and just stay at home enjoying myself.
---
A decent mage as well.
---
Solod her as shadow priest as well. Took a while but dot and kite + she takes brakes to fart or whatever.
---
It can actually be unseen: https://blizzardwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ArthasDK-Header.jpg
---
Quite the opposite. I’ll alt it up big time considering we ‘ll have official servers that won’t shut down abruptly. I’m feeling more secure about the idea than I did on pservers, where I only invested in one char.
---
Prerequisite to anything is to own Wallpaper Engine. After that you just have to click the link in my comment and subscribe to the one(s) you want. Then when you open Wallpaper Engine again they should download and you should be good to go! Another option would be to look them up by name in the workshop tab of WE. Have a good one!
---
Are they? Do you know even their name? I doubt many do, even if you only ask the people who have watched the video.
---
I'll bet a lot more people remember &lt;Serenity Now&gt; than anything about the deceased. That and Scatman, looking at comments in this thread.
---
I don't think most people want their funeral to be something that generates notoriety. A funeral is generally intended to be an event only for those who knew the dead, to get them together and cope with the death.
---
Who takes 24-48 hours for 20 levels???
---
You could say the same about a KKK rally being held in the game.
---
And for casters the pants from Ossirian are BiS until Naxxramas too

Terms of service can 1 shot raids though.

There is Wpvp on pve servers.
---
It will however die a little with the introduction of battlegrounds. 
---
Just to make that clear. If you stand in goldshire with activated pvp, there is no way there won't be a big ass fight going to happen. 
---
PvE is not the carebear world PVPers want to make you believe.
---
It's just not possible to kill lower characters who are still leveling, or to surprise a lot of people while farming. 
---
Wpvp is about consensual wpvp. 
---
Alliance attacking Barrens?
---
That is a thing on pve servers. But you are not forced to join if you don't have the time.
---
&gt;I see the same people that are against LFG/LFR also being for crossrealm bgs
---
Literally the biggest hypocrisy that is repeated endlessly in Classic cross-realm BG discussions. It's nothing short of infuriating to have people constantly clamour about how important it is for dungeons to be limited to your own server, and then immediately turn around and say it isn't important for PvP.
---
Maybe for you it isn't, but for me it's basically the most important thing in Classic. Dungeons, raids, everything to me is just a means to an end of getting an edge in PvP'ing with friends and rivals. Cross-realm BG's removes that "friends and rivals" part and my interest in Classic along with it.
---
Yeah gold and I was selling the Black stone bis preraid to other 60s and lower levelled rogue/druids who couldn’t solo princess. I would sell the ring run through for 15gold selling of the ring, basically they’d come i masterloot everything besides the ring to them enough runs till they got it. 
---
Without the ring run gold and keeping in mind, No idea the rate in Classic however, I was getting maybe 35 gold/hour without having to think contest. 40 gold/hour with herb and mining I’d assume. Not as much as hunter or warlock but still fine.
---
I’ll try find you a pic of the rock.
---
Oh goon squad! That’s a name I remember! I think I watched video of a rogue of that guild. I’ll try to find it
---
I've played on PVP servers for the last 15 years.
---
Pretty much being forced to play PVP servers on private servers for any kind of population has made me long for PVE servers.
---
I have some bad news for you then... I’ll be in westfall as a gnome
---
Lol is this pasta?
---
Bold claim. I'll stand corrected.
---
In wotlk our guild used eqdkp plus. It was pretty neat once properly set up. But thats 10 years ago, I assume there are easier solutions around nowadays
---
Yeah, I'm not going to bother arguing because people know it upset people grieving a dead person, but stick their heads in the sand saying "game is game." You could say lying to a guild and ninja looting gear is part of the game but people here have a more emotional reaction to that than people grieving a real death, the double standard being weighed by personal entertainment is *yuge.*
---
Thanks man. Very informative and helpful
---
sorry, had to downvote you cause of the mentioning of gearscore.
---
I’ll make sure to check it out! Thanks dude!
---
Enhancement has improved air totems, which means their windfury tots are significantly better than a non-enh shammies. Different trees improve different types of utility and not all healers will have access to the best utility talents because they're not in a tree that helps them heal. Not to mention a healing shaman doesn't have the mana to totem dance between windfury tot and the agi tot.
---
I ain't no god-damned son of a bitch!
---
Thats the most realistic prediction about Bannerlord so far.
---
Give us cross realm international battlegroups so we can bump into our friends we made on private servers that don't exist.
---
Players start entering 10-19 WSG
---
Minute 1: 6 level12 alliance, 7 level19 horde + 2 horde pets
---
Minute 2: 7 level12 alliance, 8 level19 horde + 3 horde pets
---
Or..you can have a mage portal to stonard.
---
/script doBanUser("u/AutoModerator")
---
It was on a private server so not sure about that one.
---
Dude, you're speaking sense. If that raid had happened in retail, today, the bans would be flowing like water.
---
You're getting a lot of blue arrows, but I agree with you, and updooted.
---
Since you are leveling and communicating with each other you can make every specc viable
---
That's not the same thing. Like I said it rewards skill BUT puts time investment at the highest. You don't get to lvl60 by being very skillful at killing goblins either. But like with ranking, if you are good it goes faster.
---
Is it allready Thursday ? :&lt;
---
Not at all. Obviously warlock has a lot in their kit to help 1v2 but the spec itself doesn't help.
---
That almost happened for us once. Both rolled 100, on the reroll, the first guy rolled like 95 or something and was HYPED AS SHIT screaming. The other guy then rolled 96.
---
Here's a thought: maybe they could have Dishonorable kill on all civilians in the game EXCEPT in capitals like stormwind, ironforge etc. Thst way people can raid the other factions capital.
---
There was a reason bliz implemented dishonorable kills - every fkin questgiver and vendor was dead all the time. Why not have best of both worlds.
---
i never said it requires skill. It rewards it by making it faster for skillful players to rank than noobs. Yes you can get r14 as a complete noob, that's good, it's a MMORPG it should be like that.
---
This, people think you need to "No life" to get through Naxx. My guild (I quit the guild before we started doing Naxx, but joined if needed) took down more than half of Naxx and they raided 2 times a week.
---
I think you underestimate how long time it takes to get a rare mount in vanilla.
---
There was 2 tigers and 3 baron mounts... TOTAL on our server.
---
Im rushing my main to 60 asap.
---
Once he is 60 I'll level 5 or 6 alts simultainously by only using rested exp. My plan is to keep these alts at sepperate level ranges so I can almost always do a dungeon with friends. Will also level these alts from lv20 and above mainly by farming.
---
From level 56+ I'll start working on pre-raid-bis gear with guildies. Farm gold when they are unavailable. Get that epic mount asap.
---
RS3 also gets regular *new* updates though. Classic will go through it's phases but it wont be getting any new content. Even if they release TBC, that still isn't new content. Not saying classic will fail or anything, just giving a little insight.
---
Get your attunements
---
I am not sure what people consider a "hardcore" raider but I wouldn't consider any of that as hardcore. You can clear all content while current on a 9-12 hour schedule and I would consider that as semi-hardcore.
---
I can highly recommend leveling fishing/cooking while you're leveling. Might slow you down a bit, but makes it bearable in comparison to fishing for hours once you hit max level. It's just 5 skill points per level, easily doable if you account for it. 
---
I'm going either Rogue or Warrior and I'll definitely take Herb + Alch (again, skilling both while leveling. Potions help a lot and you can make decent change selling some potions). 
---
I guess once you're max level your best bet is to establish yourself as skilled player (especially as a rogue), run dungeons to get your pre-raid gear, farm gold for your epic mount, do some world PVP, help guild members etc.
---
Ii would like some clarification on changing professions and profession specializations:
---
I have recently found out, that there is a Book "Soothsaying for Dummies", that lets you drop your profession specialization. Did this exist back in vanilla?
---
Also does it cost anything to drop a profession?
---
My plan is going with mining+skinning first, then when i reach 60, drop skinning for engineering, go gnomish for the BoE and other items, then re-spec into goblin engineering. Can i do this without completely resetting engineering to zero?
---
Well, that's where the point of disagreement is. For me personally and a lot of the classic crowd, community is far more important than the instant gratification of spamming queues. That's what got us group finder after all.
---
Most definitely first do the attunement quests for Onyxia, MC &amp; BWL (if available at that time), I would even advise to look at the things you can do while leveling the last bit 56+.
---
These are mostly TBC-ish wallpapers though. The look good but I fail to see the connection to Classic.
---
The thing is, horde are too stupid and un-organized to pull this off. They prefer finding lower level players to camp, or seek out the mismatches (i.e. horde rogue vs. alliance holy priest, or T3 vs. blues/T1), and then run from anything resembling a fair fight.
---
Yeah, I’m not even saying that I agree with it; just that it is handled differently by PR teams today than more than 10 years ago. 10 years ago they basically said, “That’s PvP, deal with it.” Now, I would expect a multi-paragraph write up about banning players involved, reparations for the funeral party, and an over-all denouncing of any and all griefing.
---
Some people would rather just ignore the fact that video games, the internet, and the world now are much different than they were 10+ years ago.
---
Warriors are awesome with preBiS gear, and still great in Naxx gear.
---
Warlocks are rather crappy with preBiS gear, but awesome in Naxx gear.
---
So obviously, it's Warlocks. Warriors only need a very basic level of gear to not suck completely.
---
Hero!
---
I found it fucked up to begin with and that has never changed. It happening was hardly unexpected given that it was on a PvP server and all, but this video is why I never had any positive illusions about the nature of WoW's community, especially as someone who was (and once again will be in Classic) forced by friends to roll on a PvP server.
---
ZG and AQ20 have great gear. ZGs Fang of the Faceless is a VERY good main hand dagger for rogues, since it's slow as shizzle.
---
The weather.
---
Torrential rain that's loud and annoyingly limiting vision. Fog and snow so you can't see shit. To me, it's just not fun.
---
Also why retail isn't worth playing
---
It's 50-100 on main games, but to answer your question: yes. It's not about how many people watch you, it's about how many of those are willed to support you. And I am lucky to have a very amazing community :)
---
other than the mc portal what attunments exist in phase 1 ?
---
i played vanilla but no way i remember any others, few dungeons have keys i will need
---
It doesn't make a huge difference at the lower levels, so pretty pointless to do &lt; lvl 30. At lvl 25 for instance you'd probably go through an entire 10 days of rested exp in one or two days. At lvl 50 it is a nice boost but yeah unless you only play 20 mins/day you'll still be using it up pretty quick so it's not like you'll be playing 100% in rested exp (and keep in mind rested is only a bonus for mob kills not quests so it's no way near a 100% increased levelling rate).
---
Your definition of not very long sure is different than mine.
---
Listen, if you want a classic with 3 viable specs roll warrior like everyone else.
---
Both server-specific &amp; cross-server BGs were a thing in vanilla, so the tried and true argument of shouting "\#nochanges" doesn't work in this case.
---
If you want a discussion about the topic, then please present actual arguments. If you wanna keep chanting for \#nochanges, then the most vanilla-like would be to add cross-server BGs in phsse 6.
---
How am I underestimating anything? There's no time limit on this, this is just what I would consider "winning" the game.
---
Most people will leave without raiding at all if were bein honest
---
&gt;YTMND
---
hmm, I don't remember what this was, but feels nostalgic anyway
---
This is absolutely not true. Ret is not only not viable, you are likely to encounter extreme hostility, even in casual PUGs.
---
You need to relevel engeneering from 1. These books came later. Engeneering is one of the cheapest proffesions from 1 to 300.
---
First and foremost: Attunements.  If you want to raid, but can't enter any raids.. then professions, gold, and rep aren't going to do you any good.  Just being attuned can get you into raids sometimes, but if you want to keep getting into raids then the next step is your pre-bis.  You'll have plenty of time for the details while waiting for groups to fill.  Attunements may not take long, but pre-bis can be a bother.  Depending on how much you play, you might get MC/Ony gear before pre-bis.  
---
All the other stuff is just there to fill the gaps between raids.  Finding yourself a source of income is probably the next thing on the agenda, but that's up to you and your playstyle.
---
The majority of specs being nonviable is what really was terrible about Vanilla.
---
If I’m honest with you I was searching for vanilla stuff. The yield wasn’t that high on real vanilla stuff and I tried to find what I could work with since I just started working with Wallpaper Engine this last weekend. I honestly would like to do more vanilla stuff and any direction you can point me would be great! Mostly the reason I posted here was my whole inspiration for doing these being classic.
---
A polymorph is long enough to drop combat.
---
Will absolutely look into it!
---
emmmm, Onyxia?
---
Onyxia is a quite long quest chain
---
I don't think we should assume such a thing, but yes it is possible that blizzard will make this major fuck up, i will be there to complain when they do.
---
ohh no this reminds me of rolling hunter again to farm her with my second acc...... maybe even third acc ;)
---
side note: tanks can run out of the AoE for a couple ticks as well - as long as they don't range their healer. Usually a quick side-to-side strafe outside of the damage is all it takes to avoid unnecessary damage.
---
I recall being a hunter, and saving myself from such fate somewhere in WotLK, by using Disengage.
---
Equip compare, DPS meters, bonus scanner
---
Speaking of legendaries, maybe one of you can clear it up
---
Thunderfury needs BWL mats right? So do bindings drop from the start, so you can’t complete it, or do they only start dropping after BWL is released?
---
I think they drop before BWL release, but just wanted to be sure
---
your first few days or weeks @ 60 depending on how much you play will most likely resolve around getting your devilsaur set, and/or your epic mount. the fastest levelers (the 1%) will be farming mats, rare drops and gold until their eyes bleed. if you're not one of them, you should focus more on getting your pre raiding gear.
---
people don't like the epic mount grind but having one speeds up everything you do, and it's a one time purchase so i tend to knock that off my list ASAP. if you intend to go for herbalism, an epic mount is a huge upgrade. 
---
i advise you to look up a pre raid bis list or two and look for the most optimal route on getting those pieces. so you could for example focus first on your devilsaur set because even if it can be expensive (buying them) or dangerous (PvP) if you want to skin them your own - it's way better than grinding the same instance for that 5% drop chance on whatever gear you also need. get the easier pieces first.
---
when you only need a few pieces for your pre raid bis and are looking for dungeons to run - in your downtime, you could grind gold or mats (herbalism comes to mind) that will fuel your endgame raiding in the near future.
---
the internet is full of rogue guides and you should really go through them if you're planning on raiding. if you don't want to spoil anything just look them up when you're 60. if you're gonna join a guild that intends to raid somewhat seriously, they will expect you to know your way around your class and gear, simple stuff such as being hitcapped or at least knowing how much hit% you need, somewhat knowing your skill rotation for optimal DPS, etcetera. this won't take long to understand at all and will put you above the average rogue. 
---
engineering is mostly for PvP or hardcore PvE guilds. very fun though.
---
and most guilds will have a class officer that will gladly help you with whatever question you will have in the future.
---
i will however expect multiple realms to have "newbie only" guilds. this might be fun for someone who hasn't done any classic raiding, worth to think about for whoever is reading.
---
 "The level 50 class quests, in general, offer the same three items. A terrible one that is never worth taking, one that is amazing for the level but easily replaced later, and a gimmicky one that always is useful, but is never that great. "
---
That perfectly sums up the paladin one for sure.
---
Most people are polymorphed here, they just follow the herd and don't think what so ever. Most of them haven't even touched vanilla :s
---
Hunter tribute is like twice as good as the others. That's why some pservers broke it, it's too good. If you somehow play masterfully with AOE on ZG release as mage, you can probably make more than tribute though, but it is VERY difficult to aoe the crocs.
---
I'm guessing something like this is probably  the standard spec. http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGs0bZbZVMGdctot
---
They need a taunt. Could be fixed with a tanking libram with an activated ability, but alas...
---
The reason you talk about is WHY the addon was popular. Having everything on a small bar on the bottom or top  with all that info, which then doesn't require you to open your bags or open your map to see that info.
---
You could also customize so you see a lot of different information that suits your needs.
---
I always saw druids as the protectors of all nature. They seem to embue themselves allies with nature's boons to bolster their abilities, call upon nature to heal wounds and entangle, harras and take down enemies.
---
 Shamans bend aspects of the natural world to their whim, almost like warlocks, their gifts are earned through a trial which often pits them against the aspect of a respective element before being able to harness their powers. While shamans are certainly users of naturals magic's, their method of using is more a manipulation of the elements rather than nature being willing to help of its own choice. I always compare a shaman to a Farseer or a witch doctor.
---
Hunters are gifted with the ability to bond with beasts, who can be argued to be their own aspect of nature. Whilst their kinship with animals is unsurpassed, I never through of them as pure naturalists. Case in point being dwarves who use guns and seem a little more detached from nature itself. 
---
Just my opinion ofc
---
...just strafe out of the AoE, turn, keybind 1/2/3 for SA (disrobe), HS (...doesn't need explaining), Shield Block (always use protection). NEVER use revenge (you'll never live it down).
---
Which means that an ilvl addon would suit our needs perfectly. You'd know who's an idiot! :)
---
&gt; DBM 
---
I used DBM almost all of my raiding career in vanilla, it was one of the req. to have installed along with Threat Meter.
---
Wand spec is an extra 25% not 5 %. Its literally required for leveling as priest because its sooooo efficient and amazing damage. Idk wut ur thinking man but you cant pass that up as priest
---
Yeah, TBC trees fixed so many problems with original WoW without leading to massive homogenization.
---
At least that shit is so early in the dungeon, you can dip and get a new group
---
Our guild (RP-PvP EU, if Blizz is kind enough will not require those kind of addons. We might require Threat Meter, but that's all. 
---
We'll play for fun, might take 1 years before we even raid, and when we do we'll do it because it's fun.
---
just right out of my mind Carrot on a stick Trinket and the Trinket that can heal bleeding (i have no idea where to get them but used them a lot in AV )
---
onyxia is a pretty long chain which goes through multiple BRD runs which will also give you the MC attunement
---
Amen brother, to those who can enjoy both games.
---
OMG I had forgotten all about this...
---
They totally failed. The idea that a single class should have the top DPS and top tanking spec is blatantly broken.
---
1. Sharding
---
2. Loot trading
---
3. Other aspects of Classic that are new
---
Well, about the aspects that were in the game back then...
---
Definitely group leveling/questing. Back then, I loved when someone offered aid with quests, and we went leveling together for a few quests. Today, after long hours in Dark Souls, this makes the questing too easy, and feeling more like retail than vanilla.
---
But, once official Classic releases, I won't think about "retail" anymore. I'll think of Classic as "World of Warcraft", and  maybe call things "dumb" and "easy", but never compare anything to retail anymore.
---
I think Battlegroups were region-specific, not global.
---
take a random statement that is not true and whine about it on reddit. is that what u do all day?
---
So deliciously dastardly
---
You could potentionally play WoW classic every day for 20 years and the odds are you'll never even see one of those mounts drop.
---
That's either underestimating the droprate or setting an impossible goal, which wasn't really the point of the thread.
---
...guilty as well
---
&gt; To that end, my main goal is going to be to make enough gold to buy Reins of the Nightsaber as quickly as I can after getting to 60. 
---
What? On private servers, I always made gold first, bought the mount, only then thinking about levels.
---
I would love if they removed the stupidly long res timers after dying or being ganked multiple times. Why should I be forced to wait like 10 minutes to res in a world pvp scenario? Kinda sucks imo 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but I remember this in vanilla being a pain in the ass.
---
It really does not, this is private server mentality and it kind of sucks. You have to reserve flask recipies for this very reason as 5/5 will roll need even when they are not alchemists. While that might be a issue and is way more ok then taking bis gear in the game for gold, considering since its hard to confirm what kind of professions people are running. When it comes to warden staff or other bis gear rolling need for gold is a douchebag move. Equipping it and confirming its going to be used is far better then selling it for gold. 
---
&gt;the value of selling it is far greater and of course applies to everyone :)
---
So the absolutely best item in the game is less valuable then gold? If a feral is in the group and people need they are in fact ninjalooting, no one needs gold more then the best item in the game.
---
Man I got chewed out just for asking to have the new models in game because "they look like cartoons".
---
Am I missing something?  Do the characters not already look like cartoons?  Thats part of the charm o.o
---
Jaguars farm in swamp of sorrows is pretty good for that level as you'll make quite good money for your mount.
---
Oh right my bad, i fixed it
---
You have to farm the rep for thorium to get the transmute recipe and AFAIK it's already on the content progression radar (not sure but I think I heard something about it).
---
If there won't be a released day for MC/Ony then the need will be spread out decreasing demand price increase. But as there won't be an explicit date people may be less inclined to farm it for profit. Time will tell how the economy will pan out.
---
There was indeed a select few servers that had issues but since they were in the minority it seemed pointless to mention when talking about the large majority.
---
Not a issue, really. Was just leveling a gnome mage alt at darnassus area and i was revered at L21. Exalted doesnt give any extra discounts. So doing your own faction is kinda automated, if you quest in near that area the first 10-15 levels and it only requires honored.
---
Part from AD rep thats helpful later on too (naxx attunement) the only real reason to grind certain rep is if you want to buy a non-your faction mount. That shit needs to be started on L1 quests onwards on the main race factions, if you dont want it to cost you arm AND a leg later on.
---
I know #nochanges but what if there was a PvP system that need x amount of Honor to reach x rank and for the last 4 Ranks you have to play Rated Battlegrounds.
---
I know that they did not existed in Vanilla but Arenas would be to unfair because some classes are not good enough but Rated BGs could work. So the people would not farm noobs and randoms and have a "fair" ground to earn the ranks
---
Hmm, I recall being level 45 and trying to solo Stockades, thinkning "come on, it's level 26"
---
Was not even close to being able.
---
BC was beautiful and amazing - until that first flying mount zoomed overhead...
---
You've never seen a female dwarf with pigtails cast a spell!
---
The point of the thread is to list goals that youd consider to be "winning" the game.... that's what I did. I'm not underestimating anything. If it takes 20 years to "beat" the game to my standards, then so what? And it's not an impossible goal at all. There's plenty of rare mounts to choose from, I just want at least 3. 2 of those 3 that I'm considering getting wont take much effort at all anyway.
---
EU or NA?
---
Not everyone works a 9-5, some people work 2nd or 3rd shift and play when 9-5ers are asleep, there aren't as many of them as people on normal schedules, and it requires cross-realm BGs for those players to get good queue times.
---
How bad is Gnome weapon clipping? (Rogue)
---
Wow Mark what a story.
---
Wanding will be somewhere around 15-20% of your damage as a priest if you're playing properly, so wand spec will be somewhere around 3-5% total damage increase. Nice, but considering you probably spend only spend 60% of you time in Vanilla actively attacking things while levelling, it would amount to around a 1-2% overall speed increase for 5 talent points invested.   
---
It is nice, but it's far from a huge deal - it's a totally imperceptible increase in speed overall. Compared to getting shadow form 5 levels earlier I think it's easy to see which way is better if you're a pvp focused leveller.
---
Yikes
---
really do not know why you get so much hate but people will know way more thinks, even the casuals because everyone know WoWhead.
---
They will have guides for everything, people will see that the t0 is mostly trash and will farm way more bis gear before they raid.
---
This is why I cannot go Night Elf male.  They're just so...I dunno, slippery?  They move around too much.
---
Don't listen to the haters man I ran a melee hunter and topped the dps. When my guild saw the raw power we replaced most of our dps with melee hunters. It was that good. world first nef, c'thun, kt, ouro.
---
About the healers in pvp late into the servers life, is it normal for a priest to just get deleted once people have T2+ gear? If I want to be a relevant pvp healear at all stages of the servers life, should I just go shamman for the mail armor or druid and fc?
---
horde wsg:
---
1 druid (flag carrier)
---
2 warrior (mid-field dps, target call)
---
2 mage (escort/peels druid, backup flag carrier, mid-field decurse+cc)
---
1 ele shaman (mid-field dps, purge, efc)
---
1 lock (ramp defense, sometimes mid-field dps)
---
1 rogue (hard defense in flag room and base, flag return)
---
2 holy priest (heal mid, dispell, sometimes escort/defend fc)
---
when you are holding flag its going to be like druid+mage+priest+lock or sometimes just 3
---
u can change lock/1 warrior. eg:hunter for lock or warrior.
---
alliance wsg:
---
1 druid
---
1 warrior 
---
2 mage
---
1 lock 
---
1 hunter (harass mages and druid in mid and your base, defense)
---
1 rogue
---
1 hpally
---
2 hpriest
---
swaps would be similar to the horde (lock/hunter/2nd warrior shuffle)
---
in horde ab basically keep the same comp but add another priest, warlock, ele shaman, and pick 2 from mage/hunter/warrior
---
in AV most noteworthy um its a lot of pve so warriors are great, mages are good in large scale pvp, and you need a lot of stealthers (probly most fun role), healers are desperately wanted, and hunters for pulling.
---
source: r14 druid + r13 mage
---
Attunements and Preraid BiS. As a rogue you’ll have a much better time if you show some initiative. You are playing one of the most popular classes, and the most common role, you offer decent dps but no reliable in-combat CC or on demand AoE. 
---
All that equates to the fact that rogues are a dime a dozen, stand out by taking charge and forming groups, take responsibility for making sure you have the necessary keys or lock-picking skill to enter the dungeon if required. 
---
The best thing you can do is finding a dedicated tank that’s not interested in dps gear and get to know them, warriors and rogues share a lot of the same BiS gear, and warrior tanks that are mainly dps focused will have no issues rolling on leather gear for dps. 
---
Professions are secondary in my opinion. You should keep skinning for farming devilsaur leather to get your legs and gloves as quickly as possible, after that, rogues generally don’t need anything craftable besides from engineering stuff (zappers, battle chicken, nades etc).
---
&gt;You cannot argue with DKP.
---
Oh, i disagree. People will complain HOW others got their dkp or how they deserved more dkp. The same drama is brewing behind the scenes. "I do so much more, come prepared and this guy logs in 3 minutes before a raid, without consumables and he gets the exact same dkp". 
---
If you use a "performance" dkp element, you are actually using a loot council.
---
Oh right, sounds like fun!
---
If you count in "lol that's actually not rare dude" AV mounts etc, sure. Then it's a more possible goal.
---
But getting the raptor, tiger or barons mount can take you your entire life.
---
I expressed the same sentiment her some time and was downvoted... i find it sad that adult people would waste time their earned vacation sitting at home playing a video game... Just doesn't make sense to me...
---
they will come when the pop is getting low on some Servers like back then and it was a good thing.
---
Or they come in the beginning because people will play Alli on one big server and Horde goes to another one (streamers and so on)
---
Well if all rules are clear beforehand and all dkp is always visable for everyone. There is no room for backroom hussle. We have rules about earning dkp by being raid ready and what that means.
---
You also have to take in the mana saved as well into that speed. The more damage you can do from wanding, the less mana you're using plus you regen more mana from not casting spells while wanding.
---
This is true but we're in a comment chain about someone not in the US and wanting all-day fast BG queues. Not being in America is meaningless: the American servers will Battlegroup with other American ones.
---
I think you're overestimating it. I also think you're making a big deal out of nothing. This is what I consider to be goals for winning the game, not "goals that I think u/Askyl will find acceptable". I dont give a damn about your opinions.
---
People missing the jump in wc
---
I've done it at level 59 anyway
---
If only we lived in a world where games came out when ready rather than to make as much money as possible.
---
People don't realize the technical challenge of merging realms. There is a reason Blizzard has done it as little as possible on Retail. I highly doubt there will be any server merging for Classic, as its dev team seems to be separate from retails.
---
This reminds me to find a guild that is big enough and has strict rules on the loot. Hope we get a release and server list soon
---
Yes. One character. A hybrid. I have a wife and kid and 60 hour a week job. So one character
---
Exactly this.
---
I'm much happier sitting here in hype-beast mode waiting for any snippet of new information about the release as opposed to getting a release date and it either not being ready and/or unfinished and disappointing.
---
I'm not wholly disagreeing with you, but ilvl isn't what necessarily keeps people from inviting others. It's the raider io scores that gate-keep individuals in their M+ progress. I haven't played retail in 4 months (Because I don't have a Mythic guild worth raiding with, and it's just not worth it at the moment ((even though the current raid looks fun)) so I'm content with a pserver for now.), but when I last did I was grinding M+ when I wasn't raiding.   
---
I ended up getting a fairly high score myself and would actively join some pretty good pugs, and lemme tell ya' some of the best pugs had ilvls that would be shunned by the bell-curve that is to become of a community that is nearing the end of a raid tier. But their IO score spoke the loudest.  
---
Also, I will admit I had fun the first week M+ chests rolled out and I had to do my first +10 for the week. That shit was hell, since we were all in a mix of blue/purple sets. Took my pug group 3 hours to finish waycrest manor, but the strats and perseverance was the same time of fun that I find in doing hardcore Mythic raiding, and the same fun I get going back and replaying Vanilla dungeons at later levels.
---
and the first wave of copies get instant out of stock so you have to wait another month to get a copy.
---
Yeah this happend to me. Had to work the release day and thought i can go the next day to the store....
---
The winner of PvP in classic goes to who ever showed up the more prepared.
---
You can play a Druid and stomp people with Faps/Lips/Laps/restors, hp/mana pots and tubers, sapper charges, grenades, med pouch/skull, rocket helm/boots, reflect trinkets, gear swaps and a million other things.
---
Just don't expect to best other classes that also came prepared.
---
Mage and Priest are much better options for someone that is competitive.  Just decide if you'd like to heal and/or DPS.
---
Sure, but I think more people are for having the honor system, than against it.
---
I really don't think this hurts the feel of classic at all.
---
Go Tauren with me! Coolest race
---
It's designed to get us to spend money on race changes and level boosts.
---
Sure it was, and that could also be debated. I haven't heard anyone who wants 1.1 talents though, and cross realm BGs are being debated.
---
given that we won't be pressured by an expansion release (hopefully) alot more guilds will get to experience Naxx, and as everyone gears up from the few bosses they can clear easily it will get easier and easier until even average guilds will have the ability to farm it.
---
It would make the other races at least playable. It’s literally impossible for me to play a troll or or. Shaman because they use Tauren totems. I mean I roll Tauren shaman anyways but it’s game breaking to me. I don’t think they should add it tho
---
technically non quest epic mount is better on warlock because it doesnt cost mana
---
Go ahead, try to not get the honor system implemented, I don't think you'll get too many to agree with you. 
---
DKs however, there is not a general consensus on, alot of people for, a lot of people against.
---
if i remember correctly you get it also from the humans in arathi (as a horde player) or was it the farm in hillsbrad?
---
I farmed both as a mage when i was around lvl 40 for my Mount and made enough over a weekend that i could also buy the lvl 60 mount.
---
Once you hit a rank and buy that gear it's yours forever no matter your future rank.
---
yup, undead reduces the gap but its still lock easily
---
Rogue!
---
First of all, create maximum number of characters at launch (to reserve names). Then try to get each of those alts to L10+ (when the levelup areas are bit less crowded or if the phasing lets you do that), because before that rested xp doesnt mean \~anything. You dont have to wait the maximum time before playing the alt, its more beneficial to play it more often, hitting that next level mark. Because of the sooner you get to the next level, you gain the rested XP of maximum 150% of that levels required XP. And that increases by the level. Matters more in the end ofc, but still...
---
So since quests usually count like 25%+ of your level and quest xp doesnt affect rested, you should finish the next level somewhere around 75-100% rested. If you are doing multiple chars it also makes sure you dont forget to level some of the chars and they hit the maxed out rested.
---
They use 1.12 as a base. BASE.
---
"No changes" refers to anything that was, and was not in vanilla.
---
No X realm BGs is just as "no changes" as having X realm BGs.
---
Learn the difference.
---
But R10 is only blue gear. Eventually people will get T2 and higher and you won't be able to compete. In the end if you want to PvP to any serious degree you will have to raid.
---
Orc 
---
Engi 
---
The End.
---
Lol I never heard that story. It's kind of funny. It would suck as a routine thing but as a one off it's really cool.
---
Can you just link the post?
---
Well said. I made a writeup about getting to 60 in my first week because I have a wife and kid and 60hr a week job, but it’s not going to work out due to me needing to take vaca soon for a wedding. I’ll be taking 3-4 days off to marathon wow, but not race to 60, maybe 30 but I’m really gonna soak it up and smell the roses. Make more friends and do some dungeons
---
RIP
---
I wonder if #nochange will support the ability to kite mobs that far.
---
So many opinions lol... Everyone who has just a slightly different experience in the game will have a vastly different opinion on important issues like this. Only 1% of you are of the experience level that grants you the ability to understand these complex issues. 99% of you form your opinions based on experience from later patches or expansions, which means you will never understand the game like a basement dwelling uber nerd from 2005. Take your wrong opinions and get out lol.
---
i would skip every quest that need a specific mob like princess or hogger. You are way faster by farming mobs or doing kill quests. With the extra gold(silver it that case) you can buy equip out of the ah that you maybe missed because of the quests.
---
Most good quests that gives BiS or really good items that can carry you 10 or more levels will be mostly in the 30-40 range (with a few extras in the 20s)
---
ZG means best mount in Warcraft history. Swift Zulian Tiger... that’s where zg fits
---
No.
---
so damn evil lol
---
After considering the arguements here, I have to agree. I still remember how annoying it was to be whispered by lvl 1's trying to troll me after a match. Or, when they got smart and started spamming messages while I was in another BG, presumably to distract from BG chat communication.
---
Main problem is gear. Druids only get healing gear from raids (and maybe one or two feral pieces that will always go to rogues first), there's basically no leather gear with spell power. The handful of moonkins that existed used non-set cloth pieces... and as feral the PvP set is mandatory (movement speed set bonus) so you'll be stuck in blue gear forever (unless you can no-life to R13).
---
it is now possible to show up to 500 records per page (non-mobile only)
---
They were the best! I have such fond memories of pugging them, even the stonecore. People were coming together again and talking and coordinating after the faceroll that the end of wrath had been. Then they nerfed them.
---
All we can hope for is that people like you get burnt out at level 34 and quit.
---
*bomb sirens start ringing*
---
I think that's called luffa, from a quest in thorium point? Might be totally wrong, but I have a hazy picture of that in my head. I remember vendoring it straight away and finding out a week later on the forums how valuable it can be.
---
I will have my main (Pala) then the farmin Hunter everyone has an maybe another farm mage. 
---
But because the server will never shut down (i know they will some time but not like pservers i mean) i will have every class on max like on retail. 
---
Ohh and do not forget that TBC will come in 8 years ;)
---
If it's 1.12 itemisation then Drak from UBRS drops a better belt anyway (Iiirc +1 str, hit instead of crit).
---
No
---
I remember coming out of STV with a list of names I was going to gank at Max level. I spent most of my time on isle of quel'danas going through that list one Alliance scum at a time! Good times.
---
I want new class firestorm hehehe, maybe thats what you meant 😉
---
u see lots of ppl stop at 12, pve warriors who can't get 14 and shamans, hunters for example.
---
My “I beat the game” marker is when I get Swift Zulian Tiger and Ten Storms set. This is me being realistic. It was T3 Corrupted Ashbringer but then I woke up
---
Thank you all for the helpful advices you have given me.
---
From what people post I have understood that things go roughly in this order:
---
\- Attunements
---
\- pre-radi BiS (starting around 56+)
---
\- mount
---
\- professions
---
If there is anything else I can add, please let me know.
---
ZG: enchants and zanzas
---
AQ20: higher level skills for certain abilities
---
Some of the loot in both is bis for some classes as well, though usually not very much of it.
---
What?
---
Hmm, never though about that this way. going with aclh/herb would it yield more gold than skin/herb for 40lvl mount? I understand that depends on farming,but would it be better?
---
female troll is underrated.  female dwarf if you're gonna be a priest is also pretty underrated
---
Getting Rank 14 on my Ret Pala
---
Getting Ashbringer
---
Clear Naxx 
---
Have a guild of Rogues to farm the DHKs ;)
---
But few are BiS themselves. Maybe if we focused on becoming BiS, we wouldn’t need other BiS...
---
By that logic then, 1.0 talents from the phase 1, 1.12 talents in phase 6 then? You are confusing content release with patch release.
---
#nochangesevenifyoudontlikeit
---
Haha and it isn’t even april 1st.
---
Good joke man.
---
I am in a limbo between Holy Paladin and Enhancement Shaman
---
Sorry but.. cant you just fill the talents in how you think is best? You either know what talents are for PvP or you need to play more to learn how to PvP. Not really an in between.
---
I also think the game could use some qol upgrades like lfg and lfr. Achievements would also help in knowing that the person joining the run isnt a total noob. Flying mounts would help a ton since flightpoints are badly placed. Guilds could also have a buyable garrison like thing to make it more lucrative to join a guild. Also crossfaction guilds should be a thing for those of us wanting to RP the neutral faction. (Now guess if there should be a /s here?)
---
Hope you abandon an already completed quest poopyhead.
---
I feel pretty confident that hunter tribute runs will be disabled in some way. They are literally game breaking once hunters catch on. That’s why different methods of nerfing it has been implemented on private servers.
---
I have a feeling that leashing and mob A.I will seemingly work the same way as vanilla, but will actually be like retail, where they have much more options in terms of leash time, specific pathing for bosses etc.  they’ll defend this in the same way they did with wall jumping, which in my opinion is fair, even though I love wall jumping and would love to get to out of reach places in IF etc. 
---
The most efficient, guaranteed to work method is probably going to be hunter/warlock Princess farming. It’s good gold per hour, but not something you can’t achieve by farming minerals/herbs/devilsaur etc (in theory). Princess runs beats them because it’s guaranteed gold each run. There’s no efficient way for them to remove this either, and no real reason to either.
---
Kill C'thun
---
Kill KT
---
I don't know how much time I'll have spare and realistically I might never get out of ultra-casual raiding, but if I can find the right guild to slowly gear up with then in the long run I'll get there.
---
Just not for the next year or two.
---
Argent Dawn rep will feel like a waste of time to grind up, but when Naxx finally drops, you'll be laughing!
---
The kind of people you see ganking around Redridge and Duskwood are the best PVPers.
---
They spend all this time sitting in stealth on the FP bridge only to have a semi decent level 60 Ally come along to scare them off.
---
I was repeatedly ganked in Redridge called Redridgeboss, I then spent a few hours corpse camping her when I got to 60 to give the other lowbies a day off.
---
So it's all swings and roundabouts.
---
Let the war begin https://i.imgur.com/910KYpH.png
---
Oh god, did some Content Creator make a video again?
---
what is that weird bag he has ?  (left most bag)
---
Tooltips states only on damage spell landing.  So quite nice for the PvP moonfire spamming  I presume.
---
No. There's way too much overlap with classes now.
---
it is better to farm and skin the dragons around sunken temple. the respawn is good, you get good thrash items and have a camp around
---
You won't be literally in patch 1.12, rather they will run the server using the database of 1.12, this includes all monster table (health, mana, ability, armour) loot table, models, map. The ability to leash a mob is coded into the server code, it's not part of the database. As they say, they will use the modern server and client code, albeit with some patches to recreate older behaviour.
---
Engineer.
---
Orc if you're fine with being at the mercy of RNG for racial.
---
Undead if you want a racial you can control without RNG.
---
Nice, glad to hear it.
---
*Sharpbeak wants to know your location*
---
10, iirc - typically assigned by region.
---
Unlike retail, getting to level cap takes way more time. There will be very few players to be 60 within the first week. Noone will be 60 below 4 days into the league. There will be a small trickle that start to hit 60 around days 6-10. There is no rush. MC may not even be open for a few weeks(we don't know). Also, even if you did not make 60 before phase 2 hit, you would not be that far behind. Dire Maul gear is competitive enough with MC gear that you wont feel way outmatched.
---
Laddy... This was meant to stay a secret.
---
I think we can all agree, this is a poor somewhat successful attempt at trolling. 
---
You sound like me when I was 10 though, so you may just be a prepubescent lad who just gets too excited and blurts out constant nonsense?
---
If all you want to do is heal, then play Shaman. Druid if you're willing to tank in addition to heal.
---
Neither if you want to DPS.
---
I do this with both need and greed, I've both been burnt and been the one handing out said burn for not paying attention.
---
Doing a Chicago show too iirc
---
This. Farmed the shit out of the Mythic dungeons when BFA gor released and it was really hard and fun. Then played the Raid and cleared it. Took a break for 2 weeks and lvl my alts and the dungeons already were a joke because people have so good equip.
---
That was EXACTLY my experience in vanilla, waiting 30 minutes in queue so I could get steamrolled by team of marshals.
---
With X-realm bg's did I still get steamrolled by premades? Sure, but I didn't have to wait 30 minutes for the pleasure, it was 30 seconds.
---
You don't have to dream OP. Retail exists.
---
Worrying about raiding spots is not something you should be considering when picking your class. Literally drop it from your mind completely, you dont want to be like all the other morons here picking their class based on dps rankings, or "who gets the prettiest tier sets".  
---
Pick Mage if you are new to the game and want to be good in PvP.  
---
Pick Priest or Druid if you want to do more than dealing damage in PvE.
---
Depends on your definition of "win". If your definition of winning is the top spot on the meters, then yeah, Druid is not the class for you. If your definition of winning is doing whatever it takes to clear content, then Druid fits that better than anyone else.
---
Waiting for healers and tanks all the time due to #nochanges

I'll be playing a resto druid and holy paladin so I don't have to wait for groups thanks to #nochanges. I don't have time for your bullshit.

could azuregos be kited to org?  it's around the corner relatively speaking

if XR runined it, then it wasn't that great to begin with.

Imagine writing an essay for school, taking an entire quote from some text, not putting quotation marks around it or indicating that it was a direct quote, having your teacher point out that you plagiarized it, and you respond with "I didn't claim it to be my own, I just thought it would be helpful in getting my point across to the reader." When you present something in your work, you are always claiming it as your own unless you explicitly indicate that it is being quoted or borrowed from somewhere else.
---
Yah it's really hard to do simple things like dismiss pet and lay traps for pulls.
---
Actually it is really hard it seems lol. Most hunters dont do it
---
New classes in wow is in it self not a bad idea, but it has no place in classic because classic is not a remaster or anything like it.
---
Get full naxx set for balance druid
---
Agreed. There are private servers deliberately capping the respec cost at 5g, and the economy hasn't exploded at all. Prices are fairly similar to comparable servers with the blizzlike cost. So clearly the gold is going somewhere.
---
I like your additude 😁
---
Yep, 100%. 
---
This guy is correct though, you knew every single one of their names. It helped to leave the battleground or just sit afk in the graveyard faster when you saw it was going to be a face roll.
---
The fate of the Server you chose. The Server can be one of the greatest or even balanced one (i think this will not happen because people will chose a alli and a Horde server like retail) but can also one of the most unbalanced and toxic server you ever seen.
---
I think  that a big problem could be the fanbase of some Streamers (luckly we do not have that many here in EU and specially Germany) but also the balance between Horde and alliance. 
---
Here in Germany over time (the first 6 Months i think) the people start playing Alliance only on Aegwynn and Horde on Blackrock. It ended with a 90% to 10% ratio and was totally unplayable and they were also the biggest servers.
---
Urgh, this fucking retard.
---
I saw him TRYING to play the Classic demo.
---
He was bitching there was no quest markers and couldn't figure out how to play the fucking game.
---
Is this the level of streamer that passes for good nowadays?
---
well there was only eu and na servers during vanilla , forget what expansion they started making other region servers i know i played NA during vanilla
---
I usually level with mining/skinning, make some vendor cash and mats i need to skill up engi. Then drop both and pickup engi/herb.  
---
As to talents, you cant go wrong with SM/Ruin. if you are fast on leveling, you still have to wait on next phase for pvp. And with this specc you can do both PVE and PVP + you can farm Mara.
---
ahh yeah i remember that vaguely ill have to do that, cheers
---
DKP was great for me in Wrath. Consistent attendance was rewarded with higher DKP to spend in a naturally created "economy" within our raid group. Everyone had an idea of how much a Weapon should cost, and if the main Rogue wanted to bid all his DKP for it fine. Next time it drops someone is probably going to pay half that amount. Rogues fault for bidding too high. Seems balanced and fair to me. That being said, will it work in a 40 man group with the same amount of gear dropping? Probably not.
---
If we both need [x] and we're **both actively participating in the group**//
---
You skipped the step where you decide to ignore my LFM because I mention the reserve, as I'm not dick-ish enough to try to claim an item where we both accepted a random invite and I'm not already the core of the group. 
---
I'm bringing my wife of 10 years as a priest and my best friend since 7th grade, so it looks like we'll be be ships in the night. For me to inconvenience you, I have to have wasted your time, and I haven't done that until you join my group, put in work, and aren't equally rewarded.
---
you are totally right here it is:
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19141](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19141) 
---
I really will keep most of the Quest items because you never know when they will be good (still have the lightsaber sword in retail ;) )
---
when i played in wotlk i had every class on lvl 80 and played with them at least pvp and with a few pve. i still had my main (paladin), but i played all classes. 
---
for classic i will only play one char. 100%. i want to out all my time and dedication into one thing. the hard thing is deciding what to play. i am tending towards rogue (main in tbc/start of wotlk), but paladin would also be an option. already played a rogue to 60 on a private server, paladin currently at 29. when classic start i will have made my decision ;)
---
M-mecha jeraxxus?
---
Definitely a rogue about 20 meters away from you waiting for a cool down to finish.
---
RIP to both you and your fish.
---
20 meters is 21.87 yards
---
NO
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
FUCK NO
---
generally pre-raid bis, MC attunement, Onyxia attunement, epic mount, start ranking, quest items (skull of impending doom, pocket watch thingy), engineering
---
From personal experience, the size of the chick does not matter quite so much as the resilience of the boobs. There is a limit, but a "thicc" chick with perky boobs can quickly make you forget about the extra pounds (until she is on top - NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN).  
---
...and yes, what started out as "one drunk night" turned out to be a fairly routine booty-call, if all else failed and the mood struck. I'm not ashamed to admit, it was pretty good. Might've even married her, tbh.
---
PvP tryharding is orc+engi.  The choice is just whether to level it ASAP or go double gathering and level it up @ 60.
---
Engi is godlike for PvP and hardiness makes orcs laugh at rogues trying to stunlock them. WotF is nice, but it's slightly overrated due to having less locks ally-side (so warriors and priests are  the ones who consistenly will be trying to fear u, felpuppy's devour magic and spellstone are there to help) whereas warriors and rogues will be your demise unless SL and even then hardiness is still so damn good. 
---
Other racials aren't as impactful: pet damage doesn't scale apart from some talents and an [item](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18354#dropped-by), axes are not an option, rage is melee ap only, and the same for UDs: breath time sucks when you already have unending breath, cannibalize and shadow resistance are helpful but nothing too impactful in the long run.
---
Priests in vanilla will always be the most desired healer in premades because of dispels, especially for horde side since shaman isn't a dedicated healer (their best spec is elem/resto hybrid).
---
I don't think classic will ever reach a point where servers are full of 
---
people in T3. Most people quit the game, abandon their character or reroll on a fresh server before Naxx is even out. A lot of people who are decked out in T2+ raid log for the most part. The odds of pvp being ruined in 3 years because everyone is in T3 seem really low because players will demand fresh servers after 2 years, that's the case on pservers - servers tend to die once Naxx is being farmed heavily because at that point, the game isn't considered fun anymore by many.
---
Not sure what we can really tell you.
---
Just roll the class that resonates the most with you... and you can find a guild before classic launches and can give you a raidspot.
---
awesome
---
Will make a guild dedicated to this.
---
Which race should I pick as a mage on the Horde side? I was thinking Undead would be good for CC clears, but how useful is the Troll Berserking?
---
Take herbalism, all potions that you use are one time uses. A LOT of engineering stuff is multiple uses once you make them (trinkets, rocket boots etc) aka you dont need as much materials after the initial levelup. And leveling engineering is one of the cheapest ones (without mining).
---
And you should just think what makes you more gold in general, not what gives engineering materials.
---
No... All that stuff belongs in retail...
---
Classic is about going back to the original game with the original design..
---
It is.  This is the quest for it: [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7727](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7727)
---
When our ping went from 200ms to 30ms, it was like a whole new world had been opened.
---
DKP doesn't fail because of DKP, it fails because its goal is to distribute loot "fairly" while what's "fair" is actually completely subjective. You will never get &gt;1 people to agree on same definition of fairness. You can have millions of rules of what activity earns DKP and what activity loses you DKP and it doesn't change this fundamental.
---
If you want to distribute loot optimally for raid progression, rather than "fairly", DKP is complete shit.
---
Yes, I rememver him being online 24/7. I felt a bit sorry for him and wondered at the time about his home and family and health. It's not good to spend 5-10 years doing so much of WOW. He's just sit in ironforge idle on his Scarab mount on the bridge at times. Except when he noticed people inspecting would do a small turn around or small movement. This would go on for hours. Something deeper was definitely up with the guy.
---
Upvoted because that is deserved. I always felt ganking lowbies should incur an honor penalty and massive, stacking debuffs. Something like "Dishonored: You have stooped to their level and will carry the weight of their passing" And then have that player stuck at the level of the player they just killed (and yes, any gear requiring a higher level wouldn't apply it's stats, so they'd effectively be running around naked) until they died themselves. Because this would incur a hilarious effect in WPvP where lowbies could wreck high level players by dying in their AoE.
---
Were you there, these people were hated for years by a lot of people.
---
Female human with a ponytail is god tier offensive caster
---
only read the headline. what he hell is this fucking nonsense. when i started visiting this sub there where not so much bullshit threads on a daily basis...
---
Youtube has a date for 2021 :&gt;
---
How dare you ask for something reasonable that only affects you
---
This is bait, but I've always wondered how necromancers, which I  believe were a cut class early on in WoW's development (Or perhaps I'm mistaking it for another?) would have played out, and if they'd be too similar to warlocks. I guess they'd probably be just as DoT reliant, perhaps with temporary summons that require corpses over soulstones.
---
Yep, you are right. Die hard 'muh pvp' people don't get that they actually don't have the freedom they think they do. This was a public event advertised beforehand. It wasn't some RP event you could crash. They could have been banned back then. I honestly wish they were.
---
Sure, Tommhisgey
---
Your opinion on loot doesn’t surprise me anymore.
---
I can see where you're coming from, but you're more likely to be succesful appealing for those elements in Retail WoW (Especially when it comes to classes, MoP was great for that) rather than adding them on to Classic.
---
Go gank noobs in lower areas to show your strength??
---
I just dont like it.
---
I understand it, but I dont have to like it.
---
This never* happened in Vanilla, and it just blows my mind that this is where the community is.
---
At least as you say we will be out of eachothers' hair.
---
**Im sure it did, but nowhere in the amounts that it is seen occuring on pServers.
---
Was I playing WoW at the time of the incident? Yes. Do I remember the backlash about it? Yes. Was I actually at the event? No.
---
I am just saying that things would get swept under the rug much differently today, if at all.
---
Always liked UD female casting animations.
---
I'll probably have one alt which I'll only level on rested exp. So sounds like a plan.
---
Endgame-wise there's barely an issue. Only conflicts are Dal'rend's (great for rogues and warriors, but as a set they're hella good for hunters until DM drops),  HoJ (same case, DM trinket is better, but until then...) and some 2H fighting with warriors.  There's barely endgame bows  (hi, Rhok'delar) and most ranged hunters desire are poor choices for anyone else.  Rhok is hunter-only.  Ashjre'thul has +ranged ap, crappy stat for melees.  Only conflict may be on Larvae (but well, that's only if dwarf and no Ashjre'thul yet) and the Slavemaker but hell, that is the \*\*\*\*ing last boss (and hunter's been with the same weapon for ages while warriors/rogues have had *free* upgrades -you still need to fight other warriors/rogues- all of AQ/Naxx).
---
Generally herb/alch would only make more money pre40 on an established server. Fresh server, skinning/herb is safer and probably the better choice.
---
Ah yeah,fair.
---
I, too, hate myself.
---
the one you like the most :)
---
I highly doubt Blizzard will do something about it. It was there in Vanilla, it will be there in Classic. Just now more people know about it. Yes it will lead to gold being worth slightly less in the long run, but they specifically emphasised that they do not want to mess with any data - this definitely includes DM:N.
---
They cannot possibly make the value of gold in Vanilla match the value gold will have in Classic. Way more people are aware of gold making guides, the average age of players will presumably be tremendously higher (i.e. a better average understanding of finances), etc etc. 
---
I know people dislike the phrase at this point, but #nochanges
---
whats weapon clipping?
---
do yourself a favor and don't roll warrior because 80% will regret it
---
That's fair enough. I was a Troll for most of my time, but I feel partial to the Undead too! It's a tricky choice, as I'm not a try-hard player with little spare time after work and family, so whatever I choose will probably be my only choice.
---
Female dwarf with the spinning hair is so good
---
Huh? What drugs did you take before replying with that.
---
dont forget paladin
---
Warrior wearing intelect to upgrade his weapon skills
---
I think it goes like this:
---
\*If you have enough time a day play on a PvP Server
---
\*If you only play max 2 Hours, Play on a PvE Server
---
I think the first phase on a PvP server will be okayish, the second will be unplayable and all other phases you will have those scumbags that gank you and the npcs because the play 20 hours a day.
---
I do not want anyone to diss here or tell how you play this game because i self played on a PvP server till BFA (and still do) but when you have only 2 Hours a day to play you really do not want to waste 30 Minutes for running to your corpse or wait for a npc respawn.
---
I think the PvE Server is "fairer" because if you want to PvP or say "Fuck it, lets have some fun" you can activate it and seek other players they also activated it and to be fair after the BGs lunched everyone will play them (unless you have a bad Faction ratio)
---
But you also need to be of a decent level to make gold efficiently. The higher your level the more options you have.
---
How much dungeon knowledge is required for tanking? I played a Hunter till TBC and then about 2 years ago I got a Tauren Warrior to 60 on a Private Server and quit halfway thru getting my bis pre-raid gear. 
---
I don't remember dungeons in detail and honestly when i try to think back on my Warr, all i remember in terms of skill was how to keep an eye on mobs getting pulled away from me. So yeah, will I ruin too many runs cuz i don't know the perfect way to pull mobs?
---
Really? Dayum.
---
People agree on the terms of the guild before joining. In these terms should all dkp rules be written
---
Since i got forcefully had to play Alliance in Vanilla because my Clan went Alliance and ganked my Orc Warrior the first 2 Hours and i rerolled Pala i stayed there till Cata when i startet playing with my GF and she wanted to play Bloodelf (yeah who would have gussed it).
---
Now i am at the point that i know Vanilla only from the Alliance side that i am afraid to swith. ohhh and of course because of the mighty Ret pala that is broken in PvP
---
This is correct
---
Tldr it splits people up in the same area so it isn't over crowded 
---
Joining a group with your friend you can't see forces you two in the same shard
---
Female troll has one of the best casting animations in the game, imo. Unfortunately, their melee animations leave much to be desired.
---
&gt; The pvp community was amazing and xr ruined it completely.
---
If it was so amazing and everybody on your server was great, XR wouldn't of mattered. Perhaps it wasn't as great as you remember it and people were looking for something better.
---
Finally, kiss my ass for the drug remark. don't throw insults.
---
Back in the day there were Plugins for websites because we used one for our Guild. So it should not be that hard to make a Addon (depending on the API and if they allow data transmission like Gatherer used to have)
---
That's a damn good guild game.
---
I used to play druid all throughout vanilla (and later expansions). Resto until the revamp, then feral. Did the grind to PvP rank 10 for the blue set, then mostly played solo PvP until TBC. Wining against people in T2+ gear was hard, but possible.
---
A couple of friends want to try classic when it releases. Mostly for PvP (open world and BG premades) but we're planning to raid for gear.
---
I'm not sure whether I should stick to druid. Gear is a huge issue for feral because the PvP set bonus (movement speed) is pretty much mandatory, but R13 is probably unattainable since I have a job. Gear from raids is sparse and always goes to rogues first. Getting one of the few weapons with feral attack power is a must, but hard. Moonkin doesn't have any gear, IIRC they used non-set cloth pieces (which would make them extremely squishy in PvP). Not sure if resto can compete with priest and paladin in group PvP.
---
Maybe I should just take the easy route and play a class that was actually supported by Blizzard in vanilla. I'm just worried I might get bored playing a less versatile class.
---
Clipping is when a object model goes through another usually because it's too big. Something like [this](https://imgur.com/NVHgw2n)
---
I agree with what this guy above said. You have to REALLY want to be a druid to play one. I've seen so many people reroll. The truth is, we are the weakest healers and deal the least damage than all the other classes. But it's the utility and mobility we have that makes the class great. But if you come into classic as a druid wanting to have high raw healing or do crazy damage you are going to be very disappointed.
---
I still think that small battle groups are a good compromise.
---
I used to be part of Nightfall EU battle group and saw people I recognised every game.
---
I don't get the people who say that battle groups killed the community.
---
Were US battle groups massive?
---
this can only be a troll ...
---
To be honest, I still pick up race/class combination because of animations xD If I have to stare at my chararcter for many years (at least I hope so), I'd like to enjoy it.
---
Im in the same boat. I would like to get one of each type. So far im thinking of maxing Mage, Warrior, Shaman and Priest over the next years :) Im duoing with my wife and she will probobly play Hunter, Rogue, Druid do between us we cover almost all classes😁 CANT wait
---
"No, they're not real, but thanks for noticing!" - FemDwarf anno 2004
---
Fuck that website and that banner that keeps popping up.
---
But then you have to rely on it dropping. Also, as for gloves you'll either get Devilsaur or Edgemasters (The latter if you're truly serious about your warrior gearing).
---
Or they can implement Cross realm bg's forehand and head off the queue problem before it starts.
---
hunter that ninja'd Ashbringer from a top guilds naxx pug run on ours. still gets recognition to this day.
---
still maintains it was a mistake to roll need, nobody believes him
---
There’s room for 1 Enhance Shaman with the Nightfall axe for that proc though.
---
I'm on a 3 week vacation right now.
---
BRING IT ON.
---
I know this is a joke post but if I can be serious for a moment, I think the way racials in vanilla affect the game is very sad. I know entire PvP guilds that are rolling horde just to avoid the orc stun resist racial. Or priests that see dwarf as the only option if they want to compete against the best guilds on the server. But hey, we wanted no changes so it is what it is.
---
Original OC content, even.
---
Please, any chance at a Vol'jin one? I want to honor a fallen chieftain and leader of mine. Glad to see his elegant yet humble beginnings soon, once again.
---
Everyone knows male undead casting animations are next level. Uncompairable.
---
Druid is good, just as long as you don't stay in cat. Feral isn't great, but there are some hybrid builds that work. 1/29/21 is a feral/resto hybrid. Open in cat, get bleeds up, switch to caster, get dots up, then tank in bear and kite heal when needed.  29/11/11 is similar but is more about kiting in forms and casting. Both specs stack Stam and int gear.
---
If you play a Druid as an actual hybrid the results can be good. If you play it as pure feral you'll just be a gimped rogue with no gear.
---
NE Melee stance looks ugly but the female version is very awesome. 
---
The male casting also looks like a complete joke vs the other gender and races
---
*First, you acquire a few acres of land. It has to be fertile land. Proceed then to grow grass. It has to be green grass. Build fences around your green pastures to make sure the cattle stays in. Proceed to aquire sheep. Once the sheep reach a certain fluffiness, you're all good to go son. Time to sheer those bad boys and reap the rewards of all that hard labor.* ***It's wool farming time baby****.*
---
**If you wanna be a nerd and play Classic instead of being a true farmer**, the best place to farm Wool is Deadmines. For Horde, you could try the northern eastern part of the Barrens with the goblins.
---
Naxx cleared, Epic mount, Full bis gear on main, then start alts.
---
Considering we had some 9/9 geared t3 players on my server I would  say that there were guilds that did in fact have it on farm.
---
I know i want to be a lock. I would really like to be an orc, but I really dont think the warlock mount fits an orc - so UD it is...
---
People were and are assholes if they can without risk. There will be RP events and people jumping around spamming useless AOE on a RP-PVE server, just to anger the RP crowd. It wasn't "hillarous" back then and it won't be in Vanilla. I guess people will just be used to it, log out and leave the idiots alone. I will, immediately.
---
i did not have this struggle both me and my GF dove straight into gnomes. XD
---
How's frost Mage in WPVP?
---
Yes but it doesn't mean they agree it's fair, they just agree to get loot. It's like agreeing to terms of service, you don't really give a shit about understanding and reading it you just want to use the app.
---
Hey now. Looking fabulous in your t2 is super important.
---
From a time before Blizzard decided they needed to nerf FUN
---
Its your time m8, spend it however you like, just a little advice, if you starting to feel the game is like a job of stuff that has to be done, you putting the risk of burnout up there fast.
---
Well... you should read the terms of servise before hand. If not you cannot call it unfair. 
---
Every new member has to read all guild and loot rules beforehand and agreeing to them. If they do there is no way they can later complain about it.
---
Honestly as bad the pvp gear was in vanilla compared to the pve gear I was sort of glad they made pvp gear good in TBC, pvp has always been my favorite part of the game, and when you get to the point where all your gear is worse than somebody who only does raids its a bad feeling.
---
He's an Undead Rogue so I think that's already kind of implied!
---
Which race have to coolest rogue ani?
---
Mage tier set 1 and 2 give you that space hobo vibe.
---
Yea. The event itself has been immortalised, not the deceased. Personally I thought it was super scummy at the time and still do now.
---
I am literally describing how 99% of people behave. You are out of touch with reality if you think you can avert loot drama by saying "You agreed to the terms when joining".
---
Very good, beats most things.  Obviously good on small groups due to polymorph.  You'll lose to hunters, druids and random good players.
---
they all perform well in pvp.
---
mage is not competitive in pve for a loong time until aq patch.
---
priest is the most competitive in pve
---
druid can top meters with some effort
---
druid &gt; mage &gt; priest on leveling speed. they are 3, 4, and 5. on a populated server priest will give mage a run for its money tbh.
---
idk what you mean by druid isn't the top at anything, they are the best flag runner by miles and the most mobile class in the game. top 3 leveler, and one of the best at wpvp. the problem with druid is more it has stupid quirks like no normal res and they are difficult to play. druid is also top at being the hardest to get a raid spot.
---
so i'd say go with priest :d
---
I did play all specs extensively in vanilla, and "pure" feral (14/32/5) overall felt the strongest in PvP, even with just the blue PvP set and no proper weapon (just The Unstoppable Force). 1/29/21 was a really good dueling spec, but lacked the pressure to score a kill before reinforcements would arrive in open world or BGs.
---
The problem is just gear. I'd need rank 13 (probably not possible) and a feral attack power weapon (getting the AQ20 one is an option, not sure about the world dragon hammer or the one from Naxx). If I played (e.g.) a rogue instead I could just use raid tier sets, so that's rather tempting.
---
is this map correct? - [https://www.mmorpgtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wow-leveling-guide-map.jpg](https://www.mmorpgtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wow-leveling-guide-map.jpg) don't remember some zones
---
The bindings were added in 1.6 with BWL
---
Im maybe used to more structured and stable guilds.
---
Whining about loot when you read and agreed to the rules is just whining. Stuff like that will get you kicked. If the loot rules arn't fair for someone they should find a guild where the lootrules matches there expectations of fair.
---
Necromancer and another class that i can't remember now got merged into the DK.     
---
Mostly because they couldn't flesh out the individual classes iirc.
---
No, it's a Cataclysm map. You can easily tell from Azshara and the Barrens being completely different levels than Classic.
---
The best guild on my server was filled with complete assholes, who on one occasion ninja'd an item from a pug and disenchanted it in front of him, according to the guy who was spamming about it for hours in trade chat. You know who gave a shit? Nobody. At no point have I ever heard of any of them struggling to find a group. 
---
The reputation is a myth pushed by people who never touched vanilla. It only existed for the top 1% of players.
---
i would just cuz you'll struggle for money on a warrior.
---
Have you seen the size of retail Battlegroups? It's like 20-30 servers. You're never going to meet the same person twice, which to many players totally shatters the idea of the "World" of Warcraft and makes PvP pointless.
---
There's some pretty simple solutions to this. 
---
A) Server "pairing" instead of Battlegroups - pair/triple up low pop/imbalanced servers as becomes necessary. This can be dynamic so if the populations become balanced again, they get matched with another server instead.
---
B) Designate 1 or 2 realms per region as No Cross Realm servers. If they have long queues, tough shit. You rolled on it.
---
It was to give US a chance for World First Rag.
---
I'm playing druid now and I'm having a fucking blast. The utility and leveling is just so much fun. I love being able to switch roles literally in the same fight.
---
Personally, I think DHKs should be for ganking lowbies not NPCs. If they're 10 levels below you, you get a DHK. Probably not a popular opinion here though :P
---
ho you're right, missed that. here's another one: [https://i.imgur.com/m0WKSoH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/m0WKSoH.jpg)
---
That's why he said that during leveling most ranged weapons don't have any stats besides it's dps, making it rather useless for a rogue compared to a hunter. In higher levels where they do have stats, I think we all can agree that it's everybody's game.
---
As someone who has never raided or hit level 60, could you explain what attunements is/are?
---
I like tanking so I wanna roll a warrior, but not sure on what race to roll. I'm not looking for min maxing but am just a bit lost when it comes to a few other factors.
---
Like, I like Night Elves, they have a good model and good animations but I'm not the biggest fan of their 'lore' as warriors, doesn't seem to be much there honestly. Plus their racials are kinda iffy.
---
I like Dwarves, they have a good model, good racials and lore I appreciate. However I'm really not sold on the spinny 1h and 2h animations they have, worrying me that I'll regret it since animations are something you look a lot at.
---
I like Gnomes too, they have probably the best animations, my favourite racials too. But I'm worried that they're gonna be a 'meme' and their model being literally too small to appreciate and enjoy in the long term.
---
I remember how people were nasty that all quests have to be accepted instantly. I recall stopping to pick up some 3 quests at AQ entrance, and then seeing all raid frames disappear, because I was "AFK". Or, I wasn't planning to do a raid or dungeon, so didn't think about turning on "Instant Quest Text". And, then, some guy invited me to a group to do some quests together. We made a plan, that we go here first and complete that 3 quests he can share, then go there and complete the quests I have. So, we already made it to his questing place, then he started sharing. One after one, before I could even click Accept. OF course, I got only the last one. I turned on the instant quest text, then asked him to share again. He said "no" "you were too slow" "your fault". Then, he started to kill the mobs he needed and I didn't, and said "why aren't you helping?" "because I don't need them" "they're for the quest" "but I don't have it" "I just shared" - then he died, because I stopped throwing HoTs.
---
He asked "Why didn't you heal?" - I responded "I did, but they expired. You were too slow." - and, even though we were only 2 in party, I kicked him instead of leaving - I wanted him to see that message. He was on my ignore already, of course.
---
And that's the one thing I hated in vanilla - discrimination against instant quest text turned off, and toxic rage against waiting 10 seconds.
---
Fortunately, this time it will be better. An AddOn, that lets you accept quests without waiting, is already written for Build 28377 API, and is waiting for them to enable AddOns on Classic, so I can test it. I was so confident about this one, so I made it for the demo's API, before its server even went online, even though I didn't have a way to test it. I was just enough confident about this AddOn being the absolute musthave. Even more important than threat meters, because you can still do easier content without them. Even more important than unit frames, because the stock ones still show some primitive health bars, that are enough in many cases.
---
So, once I get my hands on the Classic client with AddOns enabled, and once I make it to the server to see if it works, well, you'll see me on CurseForge.
---
and the level zones are from retail wow i think because no way you could level to 60 in Westfall
---
&gt; Maybe I should just take the easy route and play a class that was actually supported by Blizzard in vanilla
---
As a wannabe feral druid in vanilla just like you, I swapped to rogue and warrior on pservers over the years and it was a much better experience. I would never go back to vanilla druid, unless you really like healing and PvP as an hybrid.
---
They better use the new timewarp client once it's released.
---
How good are shadow priests in the various aspects of endgame?
---
Raids, solo PvP, group PvP? Any hard counters in 1v1? Are they constantly getting asked to respec to disc/holy by their group?
---
You have my dagger.
---
On Bonechewer US I think it was a Druid from Vis Maior got the first one. Which at the time I thought was stupid.
---
yea i guess its like the same as mage/rogue pre-40.. but u get mount speed too later
---
I don't think I will be a griefer. I will probably kill a low level 2-3 times and then I will move on. 
---
And yes, as @bobhoebehop said it's kinda implied kek
---
The key to good tanking in Vanilla is to call Sheeps and saps knowing some shortcuts. It is expected that you mostly lead a group but because there is no real boss mechanics beside ubrs or Mara you should have no big problems. 
---
After the first 2 Runs you should know enough to make the calls
---
I miss first aid and profession 'racials'
---
fem nelfs have the best casting animations, but it's ruined by them not being able to roll warlocks or mages
---
&gt; you also need to be of a decent level to make gold efficiently
---
Yes, seeing that blizzard will more likely iterate it the nochanges way - mount by itself costing 900 gold, riding costing 100. On private servers, you get your mount for 100g, before you can even afford riding.
---
The traditional wisdom is that mages are quicker levelers than priests. This is true in a vacuum because of AE leveling. However, it's likely that you won't be doing much of that on release, because so many people are going to be rushing leveling zones, and if you're on a PvP server, I definitely wouldn't count on that. 
---
I would strongly recommend looking at mages through the lens of single target / group leveling rather than leveling one up on a top heavy server.
---
female undead caster. can't go wrong
---
I think you might find [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-attunements-and-keys-dungeons-raids) resource helpful.
---
No cities? No Flightpaths? 
---
Beside this i like it ;)
---
Multi target aggro and reaction time are more important skills than knowing every single pull on every leveling dungeon. Most of them come down to simple logic; watching for patrols, using LoS, symbols for target order. Plus you can always ask the group for suggestions when in doubt.
---
Female UD rogue😱
---
Its not that bad. Best advice is to not rush and mark your targets for crowd control. As long as you can do these two things, you will be able to get through the instances fine. Most wipes in vanilla were due to silly pulls and not planning the fights ahead.
---
So which are alliance and horde territory and where would the capital cities be
---
Human is the best for alliance due to the weapon skill. Swords (and maces) are often excellent tanking weapons.
---
1% dodge on night elves is a noob trap, don't go elf unless you are set on style reasons. Dwarf stone form can be useful. Gnome escape artist is mostly for pvp but can be used on a few encounters to minor effect.
---
Pick human or else just what you like best I guess.
---
Yeah this one is accurate for vanilla.
---
I think I've narrowed down my list to hunter, warlock and mage. I will mainly be doing PvE and wPvP. I want to be able to solo level smoothly and also have reasonably easy to farm gold.
---
My friends and I haven't decided if we're playing horde or ally. I'm pretty sure that I'll be playing a undead warlock if we decide on horde. I'm not too keen on ally warlock because of undeads. Mage seems kinda squishy but food/water and portals would be super convenient. I played hunter back in vanilla and know them pretty well, but would probably play NE now instead of Dwarf. Hunters are solid for lvling and pvp, but it would be nice to try something else.
---
Can't really decide on one of them. Ideally I'd play warlock, but I'm concerned about their gold grinding ability and playing against undeads in pvp.
---
I see Northern Ireland finally got rid of that border problem.
---
August is more realistic than July tbh
---
June 21st is coming up and we have no concrete evidence.. it is optimistic but you never know. There’s usually a trailer a few months before the release, games don’t really drop in 1 month after the release date announcement. Again, there’s always the exception :)
---
Something betwen June 21 and September 23. But if they find something that does not work or the beta shows something they have no problem to release it in Winter ;)
---
Missing some pretty yuuuuge mountain ranges
---
when was this added exactly, as searching around various wikis and db sites i cannot find anything that pinpoints when it was added
---
My guild won't even entertain the idea of a shadow priest during progression raiding. Not even one. Raids on farm might have room for one. Solo PvP is great, group PvP is ok. You will probably need to do a lot of respeccing, yeah. 
---
Discipline builds actually aren't terrible for PvP. I've seen a lot of videos lately that have been inspiring. 
---
https://youtu.be/B8FtMO6UDAM
---
It's not a Tuesday, so it is very unlikely to be that day.
---
Yes. They will surely be happy with people having to roll a hunter alt in order to compete for gold
---
Frost mage dominates all melee classes and builds. They also destroy hunters if they can stay in their deadzone by utilizing frost nova and slows. From personal experience I would say they are one of the best PVP specs - especially 1v1.
---
Thank you for your service.
---
Just noticed, Australia looks like Northrend.

Cross-realm battlegrounds pose a significant problem for RP realms who are either grouped with PvE realms, and thus players that don't follow the same naming/behaviour rules or (assuming they are brought back) with RP-PvP realms who are playing in a very different environment.
---
Hell yea!
---
Gnomes have the best pvp racial for melees so they're not going to be a meme, although you're right armors overall suck on such a tiny model.
---
As far as tank min/maxing go, in the alliance your only real option is human for the bonus threat from sword/mace spec but arguably threat is less of an issue in the alliance thanks to Salvation so it's not nearly as important than min/maxing in the horde. The downside is human is the last choice when it comes to pvp racials.
---
*laughs in Druid*
---
Hi, /u/ZaddiZuZotty
---
Looks accurate to me.
---
Not really, the Osconty theory as well as Blizz talking about us having a "Classic Summer" indicates an early summer release not a late summer release.
---
I think in legion. Pritty recent.
---
Gameplay is awful and overpriced after the first 18 tutorial levels. Would not recommend.
---
if you  pvp, undead. if you pvp and pve, undead. if you just want to pve or pick herbs with 0 interest in pvp then troll.
---
While this is true about RNG, what should also be said is that orc RNG will often win you fights when it happens. Wotf May win you fights too, or it may not be necessary (as you can trinket fear, and spell lock warlocks, or devour magic the debuff)
---
Do you think that this long silence means they decided to cancel Classic?
---
Female Tauren.... Yep.
---
Wow nice PvP vid. Disc priest gets fat crits? Who knew?
---
Ion said specificially that they do not want to apply today's problemsolving to Classic. That's it. The goal isn't to release a better, perfect Classic - the goal is to replicate it as close to the past as possible. Blizzard knows that this has certain consequences, but it's a necessary evil.
---
Also you won't need to be hunter to compete for gold. There's definitely alternatives.
---
I'm talking about while leveling, at 60 you shouldn't be rolling on gear anyway it's going to be loot council. Or you're talking about pre raid bis, but obviously people are free to need on bis.
---
No think for me everyone DURRRRRRRRR
---
AFAIK addons cannot make external requests e.g.  GET a web API.
---
Im torn between priest and paladin. Played human priest to rank14 in vanilla, and would love to play a dwarf this time. However I also love paladins and their endless utilities. Classic will probably be full of rogues and warriors following the bis meta, which leads me to think i would regret not rolling with the paladins extra survivability towards these classes if I choose priest. Not easy. Gonna play on a pvp or rppvp server.
---
Still 67% priest 33% paladin. Try to change my mind.
---
They are good in raids, however most raids tend to only have a maximum of 2 shadow priests, meaning getting a spot is very competitive.  In PVP......they melt faces. Very powerful in both BG's and world PVP. I couldn't comment on classes they are specifically weak against however,.
---
If your new to classic alliance definitely has coolest cast animations
---
You are very likely to be asked to respect for any PvE content as shadow is rather mediocre when it comes to damage output in PvE.
---
It's a great spec for duels and wPvP, not very common in premade PvP as most priests will be supports.
---
Male ne got those ranged animations tho
---
Thanks a lot! I feel partial to both races, but I also love me some Hillsbrad PvP, and the painful memories of STV still linger...better to be on the safe side I guess.
---
&gt; Just want to knooooow!
---
I bet, so youd Ion. I doubt Blizzard knows when exactly it'll launch. In fact, I *hope* they don't know. "When it's ready." And in software development, you never know exactly when it's going to be ready, not this far in advance. 
---
And since it's tied to the regular WoW sub, no CDs have to be pressed, no boxes have to be shipped. All they need to do once they settle on a date is adjust the placeholder in the marketing materials and post the trailers to youtube.
---
Yeah, I know it's sound crazy but I guess we are waiting for a 8.2 patch in Retail. For my opinion, Classic will come with this patch in one day. Why? This is the only a good way to separate tourists from Retail and avoid empty servers later.
---
I miss that version
---
4 or 5
---
O.k, another thing to consider is a lot of people are going to be playing hunter this time around due to work and time commitments. Hunters + pets mainly do physical damage, which is mitigated by plate Armour. So thats Rogue + Hunter :P
---
There was a new one recently that beat out joanna
---
People complain about how what they did, when in reality this immortalized her and made alot more people aware. This is how a funeral in the world of W A R craft should go down.
---
I dont like human tbh, kinda boring and I really hate the jumping 2h attack animations
---
&gt;I like Gnomes too, they have probably the best animations, my favourite racials too. But I'm worried that they're gonna be a 'meme' and their model being literally too small to appreciate and enjoy in the long term.
---
I feel the same, id really like the racial skills that comes with Gnomes (Rogue) but im also afraid that every piece of armor and weapons i get are gonna look horrible.
---
Valid point sir. The main drawback for paladins is vs shamans tho. 2 purge and im left with autoattacks white damage and maybe a heal or two.
---
Nice! This looks just like the map when it’s first opened - it’s not missing anything, unless you wanted to add some names/tower icons, which aren’t necessary. Nice job OP.
---
Yeah so Appalachian mountain range?? AmIAJokeToYouMeme.jpeg
---
There is always going to be a counter to whatever class/spec you play, so on that basis I would just say play what you enjoy the most.
---
God damn Mercator bullshit!  NOT IN MY AZEROTH!
---
Ironically thats my advice to everyone else aswell 😂
---
Ja!
---
För Horden!
---
switzerland is spot on
---
I wonder if deleting Ireland is a solution to Brexit? Think anyone would mind?
---
Me too......but I still have an internal struggle deciding on the class I want to main xD
---
It really annoys me that UD and Orc females only have 1 cast animation and most others (or is it all others?) have two
---
What's the music on this? I love it, and the video. Also I signed the petition. :)
---
its because female undead is the dopest, they don't need a secondary, wait someone actually plays female orcs?
---
I'll only have two characters. possibly 1 if I'm lazy. I know how long things take in this game, and official classic was way too long coming. I don't have years to grind this game anymore, or the willpower to do that.
---
Get engineering and use stun grenades on undeads.
---
Far to optimistic, I wish it were true but I expect August over June or July.
---
I've got a feeling there won't be a release date and just a quiet release with a blue saying - "Servers are up"!
---
Yeah it does a bit!
---
&gt; i would regret not rolling with the paladins extra survivability towards these classes if I choose priest.
---
Thats when you spec Shadow for pvp.
---
Or roll with a high rank team to save your butt. 
---
Cant help you choose but sounds like you want paladin cuz of the feeling of being hard to kill.
---
I always really enjoyed it. If they made a game based solely off that campaign I would happily buy it.
---
On my Pserver about 80% of horde warriors were orc, and that was split about 50/50 female to male. My guild had 1 female orc shaman and 1 guy had an alt fem lock.
---
Can you add continents name just like there:  
---

---
FOR THE AMERICAS!
---
i actually quite liked their melee anims!  they're not very aggressive looking but i like the stance
---
This is also going to be a case of who the most difficult classes are you are going against and if the benefits of either RNG or an on-use ability are worth it.
---
I always go undead since you can trinket a stun, Felhuntet paranoia covered me from rogue openers at 60 and after that there's not much that can take you out for a length of time long enough to kill you with decent gear and SL.
---
My hardest fight was a warrior back then due to fear immunity. Everyone else I can count on me winning 90% of the time unless I screw up.
---
A lot of this was based on how I liked to play, too. I always looked for ways to avoid proc-based anything and stick with what I can count on. So on-use or always on was my go-to.
---
Warlock is one of the best 1v1 classes in the game, IMO. 1v2 and 1v3 is also doable but 1v3 you'd better pray you're both on your game and the other guys mess up but it's not impossible.
---
RNG isn't bad if your main goal is BGs due to how absolutely random it can get. The fight can start 1v1 then in 5 seconds you've got 6 guys on you - less likely to happen in WPvP. In WPvP I would choose activated abilities due to the nature of being aware of who is around you. Still can go south, but it's less likely you won't know who's in the general area.
---
Either way Orc/Undead are the strongest choices, boiling down to your goals. Both fit the class well and engi is silly good for PvP.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? The W-PvP community was still great after XR, but the BG/Premade community on the server shattered completely since we couldn't have a community, because every damn game you played were against randoms from another realm. Even if we tried to queue the same time as a horde premade from our server did, we fought randoms.
---
The entire servers BG community where we arranged tournaments   and ladders between premades (matches played during specific hours) died out.
---
Explain to me, how the fuck we as players could do anything abou that?
---
i was so close to deciding on female dwarf for classic, but cos i'm a pala their slow and lazy attack swings ruined it for me
---
Hideous. :)
---
Just play ret pally you me and three other ret pallys go into MC AND TAKE ALL THE WARRIORS GEAR
---
Agreed! Especially with professions - most are overhyped and require too much of an investment only for a chance at success.
---
Nost is epic. But this video looks like Korean MMORPG, not Classic WoW. I really don't like the idea with population cap more than in Vanilla time.
---
Nice.
---
Easy solution. Don't play a shit class and roll a druid
---
Statements like this make me giddy with hope for a series “reboot” where the timeline is reset and the “future” (TBC and following expansions) are destroyed, with a new path becoming the future of WoW
---
Brussels; city of the European humans and capital of the alliance, refugee of the African wanderers.

---
I used to farm Stockade. Was convenient as could just vendor everything quickly and go again. Disenchanted everything I could. Got the odd good BoE twink items and recipes. Sold everything on the AH. Probably not the highest gold per hour but worked for me.
---
you shouldnt really be playing a mage if you don't enjoy spamming frostbolts, thats for sure.
---
leveling experience is a ton of repetition of the same thing - for all classes. you do your dps sequence to one mob, then move to the other mob, do it again, then to the next mob and so on. repeat it 20000 times and you are 60. priest is in the same boat as most of other classes.
---
basic dps rotations in pve are all primitive in vanilla. mages spam frostbolt, warlocks curse once then spam shadowbolts, warriors spam bloodthirst and whirlwind off cd, hunters spam aimshot and multishot off cd, rogues spam sinister strike and keep s&amp;d up. its all very primitive and basic. (you can get into various trickc, details of every class, but on a base but its all very straightforward)
---
worries getting a raid spot shouldn't be in your mind when picking a class, how inconfident you are in yourself... play good, recommend and show yourself as a good player, talk to people be social (aka make friends/conenctions, which happens automatically in classic), get prebis and enchants and you get into raids, its nothing special. only role i'd worry about in that regard is a tank role and being a mt, which is a special case. everything else just play the game and you gonna raid if you want to. ppl struggle to fill 40 man raids. i played a ton of classes on ps, and never had trouble getting to raids on any class really. i don't know why some ppl so stressed about it, and even base their class choice on that... its not a problem. just play the game, play good and you get there. 
---
druids are excel at flagcarry role in wsg, and don't excel in anything else.
---
...unless they nuke TBC in favor of a new timeline
---
Ah I see. Gotcha
---
Well the entire campaign is like 24hrs if you are going to get each and every item and kill each boss and explore all the maps completely.
---
It is amazing, I used warcraft 3 rebirth mod, it's fantastic.
---
Yes, but I also fear i sacrifice almost all my offensive capabilities if i do so. Thats what i love the most about classic wow, no class gets everything, you have to make compromises. Its a 1st world problem to be honest 😂
---
unfortunately vanilla disengage doesn't work like that
---
Long time alliance player, but the horde side has some of the best casting animation.  Honestly, UD male, Tauren male, and Orc male are my favorite.
---
Agreed! Undead male is a good number two. I always found it strange that humans and undeads have so different casting animations...
---
On the other side, undead female got the lamest melee-animation.
---
You can’t trinket stuns. Pvp insignia for warlocks removes charm, fear and polymorph only. 
---
Other than that I totally see your point, but I’d still prefer the stun resists :)
---
I remember playing this campaign and it was so good.
---
 
---
I loved the idea of using just 1 hero and not the entire base, the memories
---
Don't get me started on how p2w it is...
---
Right?!
---
this would be badass. i can already feel the freak outs of people that are planning on being server first lol
---
/r/MapsWithoutNZ
---
Need an aspirin for that headache there mr. NE?
---
Hi, /u/SquilliePlays
---
I think you severly underestimate your ability to recognize other players in battlegroups because you most certainly will. The biggest problem is that you can't duke out the rivalries formed in bgs in the world.
---
UD Female rogues have great animation for the finishers though, eviscerate is dope.
---
Why not learn about the class and spec yourself than just copy someone else spec without having no clue to why?
---
This is just lazy.
---
Hi, /u/dignrigs
---
Look on YouTube. It's been done until Blizzard made him leash back after being kited too far.
---
Ignore everyone that responded, you roll greed on boe, and whoever rolls need and doesn't immediately equip ithat shit, you call them out in server chat for being a ninja looter.
---
People are used to being spoon fed epics in retail. In classic you will have to work for a reward. So I would expect a lot of people will rage quiet claiming its too hard (when they actually are not just commited enough).
---
As has been stated, no DHK was actually in Vanilla so it can be considered #nochanges. Judging people's "nochanges" credibility is pretty gatekeeping material.
---
Not having cross-realm BGs will benefit the hardcore/premade set but would be devastating to everyone else wanting to PVP. Before 1.12 I gave up on BGs as not only were the queues horrible (if I get 3hrs free time where I can play WoW I don't want to waste half of that queuing) but when they finally would pop the opposing team would often be a premade R10+ group who would completely dominate. The only option would be AV and there'd be a really good chance that I wouldn't get to see the end of the BG since they would usually take much longer than 3hrs to complete.
---
I don't see how 1.12 killed PVP communities when you could still talk and queue with the people you knew. You'd bump into opposing premades from your server less frequently but why is that such a massive issue for the tiny minority of #changes people who want the old BG system brought back for 1.13?
---
Female Orc with the ponytail, I like how it flaps in the wind when she casts spells.
---
It's awesome, but I hope Blizzard is aiming for less populated servers.
---
Became food vendor, skills to pay the bills.
---
Got a higher resolution version? Really nice map.
---
I never really liked it, but I guess it all boils down to personal preferences :)
---
There is a WoTLK private server launching in 8 days... seems like that’s what you are looking for.
---
Its great though isnt it :D
---
No other game has made me contemplate this much (again) and the game is still MONTHS away hehe.
---
Id say this though, for EVERY class, a paladin is probably the most "ugh, not this class" reaction in pvp cuz bubble couldnt be dispelled and lay on hands was an extra life.
---
I adored my Gnome Rogue back in vanilla.  Gear actually looked ok on him for the most part, just had a giant head, which ended up more interesting than comical tbh.  The animations, emotes etc were icing on the cake.  Just do it, you wont regret it!
---
Ya i saw that project and that really was an amazing attempt. I not looking for something so polished and intense. I was just hoping for something really basic like a text to speech system
---
Yup. In my opinion, vellum was one of the better ideas Blizzard had. Got rid of one hell of a problem with enchanting.
---
Female dwarf it is then! The floating hair are fun!
---
Maybe the upcoming Global Warming patch will balance things
---
Getting your lockpicking up to 300 is a good idea too!
---
I remembered where I first noticed this, running across Desolace with my cute dwarf hunter. It's impressive they built something into the game that takes multiple heavy duty addons to implement into Skyrim.
---
no
---
Nice
---
But is filled with Barrens chat
---
There's no portals. I hate this immersion.
---
I absolutely love this though. Would love to see a zone version of countries.
---
Leveling can be either fucking awesome, or total shit. The endgame is what you make of it. I'm not sure how this would compete against other AAA MMO's.
---
The gameplay is fine, but the reward structure is not obvious. The game only rewards you once a month or so and then you have to use most of that reward just to keep playing.
---
its Been a while but double checking my memory with https://wow.gamepedia.com/Hydraxian_Waterlords seems to confirm it was revered to purchase it.
---
Also yeah I guess you can waste hours of everyone’s time with the summoning route...
---
Ladders and tournaments? What the fuck are YOU talking about?
---
Some private shit you set up was ruined by XBG's? Boo hoo then, that shit is not implemented OR sanctioned so it should be null and void.
---
1.12, No Changes.
---
You can definitely do that with less that 1500 people per faction... it’s basically a raid killing another one...
---
&gt;It sounds like this guy hasn’t done any high level mythic+ content. Let me tell you, anything higher than +11 is multiple times harder than anything in vanilla, some of the mechanics used behind the trash pulling and killing is insanely higher skill cap than using a few CC spells on a mob in UBRS.
---
Yeah there's so much going on in m+ that people wouldn't even consider in vanilla. And we use cc in m+ too, but it's much more situational. It's not to make pulls trivial like in vanilla, it's to make them doable at all. Or most of the time it's just used as an interrupt. 
---
&gt;People underestimate just how bad most people were in vanilla. I think a lot of people will be really disappointed at wow dungeons if they aren’t scaled up a bit.
---
If they want challenge like retail raiding or high level dungeons provide, yes. But I'm not entirely dismissing vanilla dungeons like you are to be honest. The way tanks work for example makes some coordination necessary for even basic pulls. The mobs might not do more than at most cast a few spells (who have little effect most of the time, lol), but just executing a kill cleanly is actually not that easy.
---
So June 25th then? If only...
---
Sunken Temple is still a trigger for me
---
Its there zoooooom in on the naga
---
What faction would be the better choice for a guild that wants to raid and PvP?
---
Paladin seems extremely strong with their various blessings (freedom, protection, kings), single target healing, and defense (bubble in a game without mass dispel). Can shaman compete with that?
---
Then again, classes like priest and warlock depend on fear for their CC, which gets hard countered by the forsaken racial, and orc stun resistance is very powerful as well. Alliance racials seem rather weak in comparison.
---
hours? would take minutes. The whole point of summoning is to instantly teleport someone over a distance. I don't understand how you would think a instant teleport would take hours.
---
&gt; You'll still want to gear out all 40 individuals, that takes time.
---
In order to kill KT, yes. But once you are done with that there is no guild incentive to go on. As people have said, obviously if a large percentage of the raiders want to continue farming for t3 or legendaries or whatever the guild can continue with that. But for at least some players (like myself) the game is basically over at that point, gear is not the goal for me.
---
I thought the same, but it’s inside the naga. It’s very well hidden.
---
Her character was r6 at the day of the memorial, so she most certainly was a fan of PvP.
---
Feed your pet bro .. cmonnn!
---
Well, I roll Dwarf, so I am automatically superior to you.
---
I presume it may be [Fist of Omokk](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13167).
---
This is an oddly beautiful map.
---
I feel like cross-realm BGs should be added in update 5 or 6 towards the end of the content updates.
---
I was talking about how XR completely ruined the PvP community on our server. You know, the ONE thing vanilla WoW was all about. You not understanding and acting as the fucking village idiot doesn't make anything good here :)
---
I’m going to start with Mage and Warrior. Eventually down the line I may add a Druid.
---
Depends what you mean. The zones will have certain fish in them and in some zones rare ‘pools’ or ‘schools of fish’ spawn in the water which can be fished a few times before despawning
---
Pretty much the same as defensive, human female priest all day!
---
Considering I’m Irish? I’d be mildly inconvenienced
---
On the Island of Ireland.
---
Also divine intervention to save yourself and your mate a repair bill
---
this is really cool
---
Damn it! I knew there was a flaw in this masterful plan.
---
The Schools of fish were added in patch 1.9
---
So I wonder if they will be there on release or not 😊
---
You know you've won when insults are all they have left.
---
Enjoy your battlegroup.
---
So, you're telling me Northrend is in Australia?
---
Why quit without a backup job lined up? That seems like setting yourself up for failure. 
---
If a job is stressful and makes you hate getting up in the morning, just look for other work and hang a penis laden banner up in the office that's says "go fuck yourself". Its a pre-tested fun way to quit.
---
those pools only came out in patch 1.10 or something I believe, so not sure if they will be there at launch since we're doing patches or if they will be since we're starting with 1.12 data.
---
Guys I did not make the map, I found it here while searching for one of azeroth  [http://taxomita.com/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-map/](http://taxomita.com/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-map/) 
---
check it out, some nice images
---
Do you also sell portals?
---
Extacly what I'm curious about, yeah :)
---
Didn't care for the defensive ones, but offensive ones are solid!
---
i dont undestand why the hate about DHK
---
if you want to rank up, you will be doing bgs, not raiding cities
---
and if you want to, and dont want to bear the consequences, then dont join the raid/party, and you can just focus on players
---
That's what she said!
---
if I had to guess we'll probably see schools in from the start. they originally didn't come out until 1.10 or something, and before that time everything was open water fishing. but since the client is based on 1.12 I think that they'll be there from the start rather than be delayed until later. we don't know for sure yet though.
---
That’s the symptom of someone googling a UK map. Not realising that Ireland isn’t part of the UK
---
You lost before you even started to argue since you still have no fucking clue what you're even talking about.
---
yeah I don't think it's confirmed one way or other
---
where is antartica?
---
Scotland got a lot hotter!
---
Questie for launch would be ideal and any raid frames like grid or vuhdo would be fantastic at level 60
---
I've always played Restoration Shaman (Tauren) and since I love healing and will probably stay Horde I'm thinking about rolling a Troll Priest.
---
However him very unfamiliar with Priest, what are my options with him and can I level while in healing spec or should I be prepared for a lot of respeccing when I want to heal a inevitable dungeon?
---
Great, leaning towards your thoughts as well
---
Let me in
---
LET ME IN!!!
---
tell me to my face this isn't awesome, a bunch of nerd friends can make servers support this and not blizzard without sharding? come on.
---
even if it disconnets me, I'm only eager to get in again, not quit the game, far from it. I wanna quit the game when I walk hours and hours and see no one
---
You’re assuming the game will be ready by June. It won’t.
---
I think you can either only reach honored or revered.
---
Winter 2017... 
---
People never learn
---
Nah there were definitely people on Archimonde.
---
well my german wow version had many many english names in it until a much later patch. Like all area and city names for example.
---
It’s incredibly difficult to make money. Mounts are extremely expensive.
---
Yeah you don’t know anything about Classic pvp.
---
Orc Warlock is broken beyond OP.
---
Well, we know where Pandaria is. Now what?
---
Thanks for watching guys! :) I didn't post myself here because the video was actually a re-upload of a previous one (I fixed some errors), but I'm glad you liked it still!
---
Nah, you are mad. I have won.
---
Thanks buddy! Sadly, they take a really long time to make, but I'm glad you liked it all the same :)
---
NZ is a naga, I wouldn’t complain. Ireland however...
---
nobody will be 60 in the first 3-4 days. I mean there will be like literally 2 people in the world as that is world record pace without sleeping.
---
world first guild is gonna be 1 week MC clear, server first guilds will be around 2-3 weeks, hardcore players will take about a month for MC, 2 months for farm raid guilds, 3 months for your average player who is going to hit 60. so after 3 months then you are starting to get behind, but there will still be a ton of raid spots, not really a big deal.
---
lmao @ 3-4 days
---
Wait, are you saying it's not? :D
---
WoTF is useless exactly for the reasons you mentioned, but also because there’s very few Alliance Warlocks who pvp.
---
Thanks buddy! That was one of the ideas I had - sadly, they take too long to do one per week, but I'd love to release possible future ones on the weekend for that reason
---
Thank you :)
---
Thank you! :) I hope they can help tide you over until release!
---
Thanks! :D
---
Awesome! :)
---
Thank you, I'll try :)
---
Haha this is exactly the same as my plan!
---
Thank you! :D
---
Thank you! :)
---
Great game, some of the other 7 billion players can be a bit toxic though. PVP happens way to often!
---
Google  **Xoss' Shadowpriest Guide**
---
It should be the first link that comes up. I used that one (tweaking it here and there to my own preference) when I was playing SP on pservers
---
Missed opportunity for a Maelstrom in the Atlantic ocean.
---
Gorak would be proud!
---
More info 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident
---
I actually played vanilla back in the day but i missed the plague back then as i started after it happened. 
---
Hope they enable the plague for say the first few hours after ZG is released . it would be a super nice touch
---
you can heal just fine as shadow before 60
---
The last bosses of AQ/ZG drop good stuff - AQ's last boss specifically has some really tasty loot that is similar in quality to MC (Non Rag) drops.
---
As people have mentioned, ZG has enchants that everyone needs. AQ also grants Cenarion Circle rep, and drops items for class specific Rings, cloaks and weapons which are very nice for some classes.
---
I'm not mad, I'm enjoying how fucking dumb people can be and trigger them to write their even dumber responses. But you can't even find a question to how you'll start the game =(
---
Can’t wait for the NZ expansion
---
That's a very good point and I agree wholeheartedly
---
Bingo. Something min/maxers will trip all over their feet over. Kinda wish something happens to make them fail, even with all their heralded pserver quotes/experience/theorycrafting etc
---
God that's cool. Yes this is the right kind of stuff thanks :D
---
I wasnt there for this, but I have heard the stories about this legend! Just like the DOT disease pandemic that spread across all the cities as well!
---
Priest without a doubt. They were THE healer in Classic, and Shadow is very good in PvP, but shadow does have mana issues, but the damage is solid.
---
I don‘t want to live anymore when Greenland is a fucking desert bruh.
---
Still mad? Yup.
---
Perhaps you could have a mad tournament, see if you can rank up the mad ladder.
---
you need to pay at least half of million gold for graduate mage academy
---
They actually developed the early WoW alongside Warcraft 3, in the same game engine. Over time they realized the scope of the game needed a more powerful engine and that lead to the War3 engine turning into the WoW engine.
---
Jaina looks... different.
---
You are confusing gated content with gated versioning. There's no patch progressive talents or gear, we are getting 1.12 version talents and 1.12 version gear. Certain content is gated behind phases, but the content itself is being released at its 1.12 version. The best example of this is pvp gear since BGs are being released with their 1.12 version of pvp gear which is much stronger than the original gear was on release. 
---
Using that same logic then BGs should be released in phase 3 at their 1.12 version which includes CRBGs.
---
Orc female has two cast animations. The only ones with a single cast animation are Tauren (both), Human female and Undead female.
---
And Orc female casting animations are amazing.
---
Loot council is the only system that can achieve optimal loot distribution for raid progression.
---
The other systems are to be used when the goal is not raid progression.
---
Simply put, infrastructure. Both server wise and support wise, they already had distribution in place but among the chaos that was the US release it took them a while to get things rolling in our side of the pond.
---
I guess I am in the minority. I don't care about racials. I only want my race to look good.
---
Maybe, but private servers also only represent a fraction of the worldwide playerbase Classic will have.
---
You're just as likely to find people you enjoy playing with on Classic, if not more likely, as you are on private servers.
---
A lot of people don't have the money to travel for vacations
---
Wonder if **Kazzak** spawns on EU or US to wipe the capitals. 
---
Cheers to the guys in Austranaris! Peace from Swedenvale.
---
Looks nice, but gameplay wise it’s the worst combo in the game.
---
Would Ironforge be in Alaska/Canada in the Rocky's?

Sleep. Lol. 4 am here is 11 am there. There will be no sleep.

---
The videogame, yes!
---
I really depends on what you mean by pvp. priests are the superior pvp healers/support by far but druids are absolutely amazing at running flags in wsg or defending and stalling in ab. In 1v1s priests can be a bit inconsistent effortlessly destorying on class while being hoplessly outmatched by another while druids are much more consistent.
---
Female troll is very underrated, and I did consider rolling the rare breed. Problem for me is that Undead male mage has always been my main, so I want to continue that legacy, plus it kinda pains me too much to pass up WotF...
---
People take this "classic summer" line way too seriously.  I think it was just a cute way for them to say they were on track not a promise to have &gt;95% of the summer for you to level up your character
---
I agree with you mate. I honestly don't think there will be a beta. Maybe a stress test for a weekend. And that is usually the argument for not releasing early.
---
They said, "A Classic summer" , not "A summer waiting for Classic". 😊
---
Low level priests are decent in pvp but not the greatest. Hunters still shred through them. 
---
At 60 they do need good gear with stamina to shine in pvp.
---
Don't you need UBRS key as well? Or is that part of the Ony chain? I forget..
---
I will play a hunter as my main, then a warrior as my casual alt. If I make any other characters they will be super casual fun-toons with goofy names and maybe even role playing.
---
At least that's what I'm saying now, ask me again in 6 months and it may look different.
---
What a hopeless dunce.
---
Um, not to call you out, but um... the classic map was actually Pangea. This is after cataclysm :/
---
locks are reliably the lowest dps lol
---
warrior &gt; rogue &gt; hunter/mage &gt; lock for most of the game.
---
That's the good thing, you can adjust everything, if your heals are not strong enough, use more CC or take smaller groups etc. communication is (was) Key in MMO's
---
r/outside
---
Dear Blizzard, please add RP-PVP servers so that they stop flooding us :p
---
The struggle continues, horde side, rogue, mage, or lock?
---
 Looking from a very long term perspective in bgs
---
In 3 or 4 years when naxx gear is fairly common am I going to hate my life as a rogue assuming I have similar gear? how bad is the "great character every 10 mins meme"
---
Same for mage do I just get exploded every time a warrior I have frost novaed gets freedomed?
---
Locks are tanky as sl but I feel like all my damage gets dispelled, so then your left with destro/or sm who's damage is great but you have no escapes and have wet tissue paper as armor.
---
They always travel in a group of 40 and kill everything in their way. 
---

---
If I roll alliance I'm pretty sure I'll play a Nelf hunter. I'm torn between the genders. Female has a nice bow animation and the melee spell animation is neat. Male has a weird bow cast and flip around on melee casts. I think on animations I'll go female but I lose all that tall and thicker looking gear on the male. A truly a hard decision.
---
A group of rogues ambushing could do the job.
---
I think you would enjoy warrior more, just be aware than leveling is a lot rougher than lock. warrior is really the class that defines vanilla
---
Side question, can you still get "rare" fishes like stonescale eels outside schools ?
---
And do you struggle for money because of food and repairs? And buying gear perhaps? Thanks in advance
---
Cannot wait to relive my nostalgia, then get tired or the grind that it was and go back to playing BFA
---
There’s sharding.. There will be no more than 3 people around Hogger.
---
Good question, no clue!
---
Both are good in PvE and PvP
---
If more PvP oriented, Druids are more versatile and have more utility I guess, like morphing to escape CC's, roots.... But Priests have Mind Control !
---
If more PvE oriented, there are more raid slots for priests (5-6 priests / 2-3 druids) because they just don't hinder eachother (you can't heal a raid with only HoTs). Priests have a better healing toolkit.
---
TLDR : you'll have fun in PvP with both, PvE-wise Druids are good healers but don't stack well with other Druids, Priest are best PvE healers.
---
Same! I was 7 myself but it feels nice to be able to do my own thing in classic. Might even join a raid guild once I figure out times who knows.
---
For real, when you get a server with high q’s it leads to people choosing not to q and increasing wait times further.
---
Too many servers run the risk of never being able to play A.V. because of it.
---
!
---
It would be fine to add when/if the ever make wow2, but let's keep classic vanilla as possible
---
Mages are second only to warriors in number of slots per average raid.  Join us!
---
Obtain the epic mount.
---
Some pservers have blizzlike server pops.
---
Thank you all for replying!
---
Oh yeah, some attunements can be skipped because lockpicking can open the entrances! Thanks for mentioning that!
---
It's P2W!
---
Nah its just how the Horde get to Gnomer... we have a quest in Orgimmar to talk to Scooty in booty bay... he gives us an item then there is a teleporter near the inn in booty bay. We step on it and boom transported pretty close to the instance door.
---
It's probably overtuned tbh, it is mindblowing how trash people were and still managed to clear retail vanilla naxx.
---
Only time today I've been mad was when I thought you'd not answer anymore, because you died of an overdose or somethin g=(
---
Classic is all about the community. And at this point we really need the community's support and help for this to happen.
---
By releasing RP-PvP realms later on in the timeline of Classic, Blizzard will achieve exactly what they don't want to happen -- realms that will slowly die out. The only way for an RP-PvP realm to thrive is if it's there at the beginning and all of us dedicated players can make our home there.
---
We are determined to do our best to get an RP-PvP realm and to make it into a beautiful place for everyone who wants to join us, but for that we need your help. By showing Blizzard how much you all support this idea, I'm sure the Classic team will listen and will respond in a favorable way. 
---
Thank you to everyone in advance.
---
When I was playing my warrior in Azeroth, I always got the message "Not enough rage".
---
But in IRL Azeroth I seem to always get the opposite message !
---
Yep, 1.
---
I wand this real big in my living room.
---
Probably fewer than 20 during vanilla I would guess
---
Give us at least one for each region!
---
yeah WotF is pretty crucial for a rogue.  i am also sad to give up stoneform on a dwarf pala but i can always cleanse ^^
---
Why is this a thing? They also haven't announced that normal, pvp and RP servers are coming out, but none of those people are making posts everyday begging them to confirm it.
---
RP-pvp servers are obviously coming, now stop making this post.
---
Only dragonslayer has cooldown. Black lotus needs to have short cooldown to support 100 raiding guilds per server, it's no problem to have 60 min respawn for 3 guilds.
---
Why would a rogue in naxx gear be bad? Aren't they only second to warriors in terms of gear scaling? I remember rogues with AQ40 daggers literally two-shotting clothies in similar gear.
---
The warrior still needs to get into melee range. Best case he uses intercept and your blink is ready, then you're fine. Otherwise you need support as well. Priest/shaman can dispel freedom, and as a mage you can poly/counterspell the warrior's support.
---
Locks I dunno. My memories of them are almost exclusively from fighting them 1v1, SL spec of course. Your concerns for group PvP sound plausible to me.
---
I forget when rogues got dismantle, was either wrath or cata, but as a warrior main I am still mad about it. It was better than disarm in every way. It removed shields as well, so if you were using shield wall, it ended the effect early. It also ended bladestorm iirc, which was brutal as that was one of the only ways to remove roots and slows.
---
Wouldn't mind framing this! In a different projection that is...
---
only costs 1g for the first respec, I would say go wands early because of how good enchanting/bfd wands are early then just respec at 40, I generally do the same on rogue for hemo, arms for ms and locks for SL on pvp servers
---
Yes they did: 
---

Is Chromie still alive in retail? I could see blizz putting out some sort of hype video where Chromie decides there's been too much dark and destruction, and resets things to try again.
---
Congratulations!
---
You have gained one level on the ladder!
---
[It's my job](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/021/work.jpg)
---
I think blood elves would be nice, if only because the horde is a sausage fest irl without them. but thats not much of a reason. don't want spacegoats. seperate bg's and whatever you wrote about hero classes sounds awful. northrend and outlands, idk. like many nochanges people I think that Blizzard is more likely to ruin the game than make it better as they have no idea of the concepts which make a game good or bad anymore.
---
It would be amazing 🤣🚀
---
I do not recommend the collage DLC, it’s pretty much pay-to-win.
---
But I thought old AV was the best bg of all time, how can this be?! You mean to say people would exaggerate its popularity?! Blasphemy!
---
Based on private server bullshit, get fucked all of you fucking retards are gonna see a giant decline
---
Went to middle east, stepped on goblin land mine.
---
I really wanted to do a re-run of WC3 before Classic's release, I was even ready to cough up the 30€ for the updated graphics of the Reforged edition, but for some reason they have yet to release it and might not even do it before Classic while they could have made a fortune from all the players waiting for Classic with eagerness.
---
Ah well, I guess I'll just do a re-run with the rebirth mod and not give them any money for a game I already own anyway. Brilliant marketing Blizzard.
---
Nope, sorry. Release will be delayed because late beta to winter this year ;)
---
Wow lol That looks great
---
I defo dropped gnome engineering in BC at the tanaris book
---
Who cares
---
Just give them there home Blizz :)
---
Consider yourself lucky, there were many people who had a bad/non-existant PvP experience because there were no crossrealms
---
Please use the WSIP Wednesday sticky post. Thank you.
---
Rank 14 gear is amazing in vanilla, except MAYBE comparing to naxx gear? Even then it's class specific whether warlords/marshal is better.. what makes you say it's bad?
---
Crossrealm only after a suitable waiting period where the server tries to form a game, then pair with others also failing to launch. Maybe offer opt out for those who get absolutely stuck on no crossrealm. But it's a GAME first and foremost, being able to actually play is way more important than perceived community
---
South eastern asia is actually reminiscent of STV. wtf thailand/vietnam etc.
---
There wont be a beta /facepalm
---
Great, I’m in Durotar
---
Why has this not been done before. Looks amazing
---
Logout, start lvl your twink :)
---
Good ol Dire Maul North :D
---
look closer
---
&gt; You're just as likely to find people you enjoy playing with on Classic
---
Just saying, if you want to find out ppl to play with before classic, private servers is the way to go. You can test out guilds and play with ppl, see if its a good fit. Or just join a forum guild and hope for the best.
---
theres gonna be noobs everywhere, don't worry about it.
---
Even if there is one, it won't be open beta.
---
Yes. The only buffs they cannot get are food buffs and potion buffs I believe. Hunters will be buying up a lot of agility scrolls for their pets because they cannot use mongoose. You'll also need to farm the jujus for yourself and your pet.
---
It's no wonder you get everything so wrong:
---
&gt; Also go check the release schedule, they clearly stated we arent getting 1.12 itemization
---
They clearly stated that items will be in 1.12 state, just that some drops are not happening until a phase.
---
&gt;Going to bookmark that, thanks!
---
i will give this post gold if this post is true.
---
I'm not saying i'm in favor of that kind of reasoning. I'm saying you can't use the argument of #nochanges to justify cross-server BGs when server-locked BGs were also part of vanilla.
---
South eastern asia is actually reminiscent of STV. wtf. i mean thailand/vietnam peninsula idk the name.
---
No free trial to 20?
---
Play as horde. 2h is just fine for fury warriors. Your dual wielding warriors get prio on maces and axes, swords and daggers go to the rogues. Spreads out the competition real nice.
---
Nope based it on WC3 were the Rifleman were Dwarfs and knights and palas Human. Warlock and rogue Undead and orc Warrior, Warlock Deathknight ;)
---
AND OF COURSE NEW ZEALAND IS MISSING
---
Having stonescale eel schools would certainly change things from many private servers.
---
Back in vanilla, I got my epic mount from farming black dragon scales. 2-4g,each plus all the vendor crap and dissing any greens I got. This was pre bwl release and no guilds had downed rag yet on my server. 
---
I imagine this wouldn't work now, as back then people got FR even if it wasn't needed, as getting into raids / guilds sometimes they wanted 200FR plus, or at least on bloddscalp horde side anyway.
---
Why is it the best though?
---
I made dwarf male mage and i paid 10 for gender and name  change... i really regret this and i have been thinking about rerolling into undead male mage
---
Fucking Big Mercator propaganda. Gall-Peters or bust.
---
Then prepare for alot of wrong/not working Quests. The BFA Beta / Release showed that the blizz standard is not that high anymore
---
&gt;Valid point, think I will stick with 2 gathering professions then.
---
Main problem for feral is gear. Every raid tier set is resto only with the exception of T2.5 (AQ). But you really need the movement speed bonus on the PvP set (3 pieces). R13 is only attainable if you have no life outside of WoW, so you'll be stuck with the blue R10 pieces.
---
You also need a weapon with feral attack power on it (ferals don't scale with weapon damage, they always use a 55(?) DPS weapon in forms). IIRC there's a total of 4 such weapons in the entire game: the mace from the AQ caster quest, the one that drops from the world boss dragons, another one from Naxx, and goddamn Atiesh.
---
So yeah, it's a really fun class, but it takes way more effeort to gear than any other.
---
its going to suck but hey no changes
---
So don't play on a streamer/fanboy laden server?
---
Yes! Picked Druid due to the shape shifting
---
So you justify a bad ranking system "because it's an mmo"
---
What other systems should we keep shitty because it's an mmo?
---
Midsummer IS June 19-25, so it does fit:
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer)
---
**Midsummer**
---
Midsummer is the period of time centered upon the summer solstice, and more specifically the northern European celebrations that accompany the actual solstice or take place on a day between June 19 and June 25 and the preceding evening. The exact dates vary between different cultures. The undivided Christian Church designated June 24 as the feast day of the early Christian martyr St John the Baptist, and the observance of St John's Day begins the evening before, known as St John's Eve.
---
These are commemorated by many Christian denominations, such as the Roman Catholic Church, Lutheran Churches, and Anglican Communion.

Male Troll melee animations are so over the top I love it
---
I hope a bunch of people use your logic against you. I'd pay good money to see your face when people roll need on stuff made for your class
---
I guess I just prefer it tucked away than taking up space in my normal view. I like minimalism while I'm out and about.
---
It will be a handful of hunters with names close to “xioqui” and they will never leave un’goro, Tyr’s Hand and (when it’s out) Dire Maul.
---
I went Warlock (That creature he had looked so badass). My friend went Mage and my brother went Dwarf Hunter, all solely based on that trailer, haha. To be fair though, my brother is a dwarf in real life, so he always rolls dwarf.
---
that was on EOTS, anyway
---
I was listening to Jump by Van Halen as I clicked on this. It was a peasant surprise.
---
If they were using 1.11 or earlier patch data, you would have a point. But they are not, so stands to reason the xbg’s would be included.
---
Sure, you can avoid them at all cost. However, to say you won't deal with them ever or even on a daily basis is unlikely.
---
Oh shit. Is the normal Azeroth map a Mercator projection as well?!?!
---
Quite a lot of people I see don't remember the trinkets only used to dispel specific forms of CC for each class.  They seem to only remember the trinkets as they were when they were all made the same.
---
Well you still have an hour left to play so yeah, playable; how about a lower pop server?
---
THIS. So much this.  I got burned once by someone claiming "accidental" need several rolls in one dungeon.  
---
From that day on I made sure to be last to roll if it was an item I wanted.
---
Peak active players is not the same thing as playerbase. But you are right.
---
Yea, they made Druid look pretty epic.
---
Look closer
---
So #somechanges?
---
Shaman because chain lightning. Without a doubt the best looking abillity ingame.
---
But this time around I'll be a mage.
---
thats like almost half a level  
---
i love it
---
The eternal struggle is making the tradeoff. I want to play undead but their racials are just too inferior.
---
Fuck, i’d legit buy that.
---
Female dwarf w/ pigtails BiS for healing.
---
Going back and forth between Ele Shaman and Warlock atm.
---
Will be mainly keen to do BGs wPVP and some raiding for gear. 
---
How boring is raiding as a lock (spamming shadowbolt?) and is it possible to heal raids as 31/0/20 ele resto (to avoid respeccing)?
---
Also how vulnerable are Locks and Shaman to melee in pvp scenarios without escape tools? 
---
Other classes I'm considering are mage and hunter, obviously both very strong in pvp but whats their playstyle like in raids?
---
So many questions....
---
You are delusional.  Its an old game.  Absolutely no need for a beta
---
I'm very familiar with private server guilds and for the most part those guilds are fairly average.
---
I will consider it an accomplishment if I have a 60 after 6 months, and I will have plenty to do when I get there. I was a late 60 in vanilla, and as a tank who liked to run the 5-mans and UBRS I never had problems finding groups. Hop in with those and get geared up for raids if that’s your thing, or whatever your end game fancy is.
---
Lol everyone will be using this logic. I know this subreddit lives in a delusional little bubble and the rabid fanboys won't ever admit a fault in the magical fairytale vanilla community, but thats how loot worked 15 years ago.
---
What guild had group loot on while raiding Naxxramas? :|
---
Definitely stick shadow for leveling - you should be able to heal everything fine and shadow helps a ton with leveling efficiency.  
---
Spirit tap and a good wand (possibly with imp. wand talent) should keep you from having to drink much.  Always keep the best wand you can for this reason and play the 5 second rule with spells.
---
Yes a taunt would certainly help too.  All they got is judgment or righteousness- at least it does like 3x the threat with righteous fury!
---
Really? When I tried to gank some noob last time, I was banned!
---
This infuriated me way more than it should have.  I used to be in a bottom of the gutter tier guild in TBC that had trouble clearing Kara when BT was out.  They had this rogue who showed up to every raid and had a metric fuck ton of DKP saved, although I'm not sure how because this dickmuncher rolled on every piece of fucking gear that a rogue could use.  Didn't matter if the item wasn't good for his spec (Hemo for pvp lol) or not.  If he wanted it he got it.  I talked to the raid lead about it and was told to keep showing up and suck it up buttercup.  It's not even like I was a brand new guy in the raid team. I had been showing up for months, and I think I might have gotten one or two pieces that guy had already won previously. I /gquit immediately and the guild broke up a few weeks later because they lost the only real healer they had to one of the only guilds who had cleared BT.
---
Can't please them all, really!
---
Kind of. That undead lock looked badass, but I didn't want to be horde - so I played human lock instead.
---
Just get the Alterac Battle Ram, way easier to grind that reputation!
---
Crazy idea /s merge the dead realms, its not that hard jesus lol
---
Well, they told us to make noise if we really wanted it, so that's exactly what we're doing
---
The undead female has an infinitely better mining animation than the undead male. The male takes these *really* slow, laboring swings like a weakling while the female just gets at it like a normal person. Plus, I like the flipping attack animation.
---
Start live res runs.  
---
One of the DM farms is good with a tank and healer, with one of you being a miner.
---
While x-realm BG's are a solution, I would allmost rather just see realm mergers as sharding is the solution that retail went with and it is so so bad
---
I imagine they might be waiting for larger numbers first, before they create too many server types. But, I hope this time around, they add them in MUCH sooner than in Vanilla. If the subs explode at launch, they need to have a plan to add them in, by the first week. Then again, the damage might be done already, people have made their toons and leveled them decently by then, probably.
---
Same
---
If someone predicts this every day, somebody will end up being right :)
---
Oh those are old images, Jaina is not like that. Infact majority of the images there are old. She looks like proper jaina.
---
Now time to map in the flightpaths. haha
---
Rebirth mod is really nice.
---
DM farms with a healer with one being a miner (as said above)... and I'd suggest getting an UBRS key, then leading full UBRS runs and reserving Ace/Flask.  
---
But overall, your options are limited. Respecing from tank to pvp in between raids was a huge gold drain for me.
---
Troll post.
---
I really hope there will be sagefish at launch, instead of at phase 5 or so.
---
I like to, RFK, SM, Strat Live or Tank Service.
---
I absolutely will be rolling on a RP-PVP if available.
---
Don't just downvote me because you don't like my points, I just wanted to share some insight into probably why things aren't working out for you. 
---
&gt; RP-PvP is 3 to 4 times more popular than the RP-PvE counterpart.
---
Let me correct that: what people say/claim they want to play on some random survey which was taken on who knows what forum that's doubtful to be representative for most of WoW population - says RPPvP is more popular than RPPvE counterpart.
---
If you look at what people are actually playing on WoWprogress for example, you'll find a different story:
---
https://i.imgur.com/Jny0YyW.png
---
Across the NA/EU servers you'll find that RP-PvE appears to be at least twice as popular as their PvP counter-part. Now I'm not saying WoWprogres is by any means an accurate metric, but it might be indicative of why Blizzard has doubts about it because PvE realms seems to be what RP-ers are mostly about, at least in the game.
---
On top of that, you barely have 700 signatures on that petition that's been up for almost a month now and it's been shared on so many platforms already. Let's say everyone who signed up for that is legit going to play on an RP-PvP realm (despite many who signed it just did it out of courtesy), and let's say you double those numbers with folks from retail 2-3 months down the line (excluding tourists) - you're still looking at a very dead and defective realm of 1.5k players, even by the most idealistic standards. You might be okay with that but the alternative could just be to simply have you 1-2k players split between PvP and RP servers and ensure these realms do have a future. 
---
With me personally, you make it very hard to make me care when your complaint on PvP servers is that someone's name is "Digbick". I get the name is childish, but so is your complaint if you don't have the mental capacity to either integrate that into your RP mindset or just block it entirely, don't take it personally.
---
Can you explain?  
---
I imagine these interactions go something like this: 
---
LFM brd need 1 dps 
---
“Hey im a shadow priest with bad gear - I can dps!” 
---
Leader: “yeah we’d rather not increase our run time by a full hour carrying you...” 
---
“Fucking elitists” 
---
Every fucking time
---
I don't know if it still does since I quit BFA, but yes, *however* legendaries and set pieces used to work. I used to do some stupidly broken DPS as a boomkin with the Firelands legendary staff, WoD ring, MoP cloak, Legion tier sets, and 2 Legion legendaries. Some trinkets worked too (DBW from ICC was kinda popular).
---
Who said anything about bad?
---
It SHOULD NOT require skill. It's a GRIND not a ranking system.
---
No we wont, theres been blue posts about this
---
Because some of us didn’t choose warrior because we want to tank, rather we grudgingly agree to tank because we’re warriors.
---
My preferred class is paladin, but I don’t feel like working around the class’ prot spec limitation. I main a warrior to tank.
---
I never raided Naxx in retail vanilla, but I can say with certainty I enjoyed raiding Naxx vanilla more than I ever did in Wrath.  It didn't leave that lasting of an impression on me from Wrath, to the point where most of it felt like new content to me (though it has been years since Wrath so maybe I just forgot).
---
Things really are a lot different when there are 39 other people that can screw something up, rather than 9 or 24 others, not even taking into account the mechanics changes that happened.
---
OP is planning ahead, its not going to exist much longer at the rate things are going so why bother adding it to the map.
---
respec costs, the 1-60 grind, dhk's, paying blizzard money after diablo immortal, the moment when blizzard inevitably ruins something, flasking every week for molten bore because guilds in 2019 don't understand the concept of a farm raid. phase 2 is hype tho.
---
I woke up knowing today was going to be a shitty day. Lets hope you are right and not I
---
Remove DM:T solo farm and suddenly everyone ''has'' to roll mage to compete for gold. Same problem.
---
TODAY IS THE DAY BOYS!  [90 Days til release!](https://www.google.com/search?q=90+days+from+today&amp;rlz=1C1AVFC_enUS789US789&amp;oq=90+days&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l4.1383j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)
---
I know...welcome to my troll la loll la loll la loll lol loll
---
Again, still better to see for your self and not take everyones word that "yeah, im HC, great player and cleared all content" on some forum guild.
---
Ofc it can be the other way around too, saying this is casual guild but in reality guild leads want it to be a semiHC/HC guild.
---
sounds like a totally believable story, my fellow totally vanilla raider
---
11 for the black war kodo ya dip!
---
Charge people 30g (20g upfront, 10g at the end) to tank their 5-man.
---
(this is only /s if you're gonna get mad at me for suggesting it)
---
PvP is inherently competitive, so a grind doesn't make sense.
---
Systems that require people to account-share to progress just aren't well thought out
---
implying blizzard shit server would handle this
---
I can't pass up male troll
---
I need to throw hadoukens, no other casting animation can compete with throwing hadoukens. Also, unlike most others, their targeted channeling animation for things like Mind Flay isn't off-balance
---
Yup! I picked Dwarf Hunter and wanted a bear! I think I had the same Awe and amazement when I first made it into Ironforge as the wee Dwarf in the opening credits did!!
---
Priests are really versatile healers. You can heal any dungeon as shadow if you switch to healing gear. For leveling, shadow hits a little harder but there isn't much difference in leveling speed between shadow and holy. Since they're so versatile, they can cover any healing role in raids. You can even DPS relatively well as shadow, though raids don't really benefit much from taking more than one shadow priest.
---
Queue times are like that even with crbgs reaching across the entire scope of the game. Look at retail, it goes beyond server groups and it still takes ages get into a game at lower levels.
---
Some bgs at 60 still take 15-30+ mins to pop, unless you queue random.
---
Anyways we prob aren't going to need crbgs since blizz has stated they will be doing lean realms. They shouldn't be added until needed. #nochanges
---
If you're including all the tourists who will leave after two weeks then yes. Out of those who reach 55 I'd say the majority will at least be in one raid.
---
Oh, didn't know that, shame
---
you should check the private server community  
---
entire guilds of 50-80 people constantly rerolling on new servers, multiple rank 14s, speedrunning everything and then remaking  
---
every single title is probably already decided which one of these handful of nolifers will get.
---
Pretty sure they stealth removed it long before the new model though.
---
Ah I didn't know that. One of the disadvantages when playing shadowpriest is their high reliability on consumables and without being able to farm DM it's difficult to find gold.
---
That was hard to read. Does anyone know what he is saying?
---
UD female crits are also very unique, especially if you are a tank and doing these flips while tanking giant dragon.
---
I never claimed to be no changes, but I would argue the point that CRBGs are more like a server change than an actual client feature. Realistically the only part of CRBGs that rolled out with the client was displaying people's server next to their name in the UI when you got matched with them.
---
That's titillating.
---
Gnomes have my favorite atrack animations
---
YES. DWARF HUNTER with a bear as pet during all leveling.
---
Ah I forgot about this. I haven't played Vanilla since, well, Vanilla and I did have alts. There's a lot about itemization I don't remember that I'd have to look up.
---
I know a lot of folks play on pservers so their memory is a lot more fresh than mine on items.
---
Its all about them animations.
---
I have found that going right down the Shadow tree does not really boost damage all that much until the mid 30s. I would go the following:
---
10-14 = wand  
---
15-19 = spirit tap  
---
20-21 = imp sw:p  
---
22-24 = imp renew (you will almost never need bubble anymore)  
---
25-26 = healing focus  
---
(skipped holy crit talent because of lack of supporting gear)  
---
27-31 = divine fury (now you can heal *sooo* much better, and grind mobs much quicker starting fights with Holy Fire or Smite into SW:P)
---
Now you can do whatever you want for the next 9 levels. I like to jump back down to get the 5% crit here and then pick up improved healing so I can heal in Scarlet Monastery. 
---
Now you're about 40, and you respec down to Shadowform for your 40-60 grind.
---
You're free to rebut my points instead of a drive-by shitpost. I addressed itemization on trinkets in a different post.
---
The floor is yours, sport.
---
I know this is not directly related to classic wow, but it hit me like a truck about what i loved back in vanilla. You could look up to people in epic PVP-Gear or that T3 armor, or be proud to wear it yourself.. In Retail everyone looks the same (or at least how they want) and sees all content with no effort... Effort needs to be worth something in an MMO (or ARPG etc).
---
diablo/blizzard has left chat. coz what GGG has been doing over these years called INNOVATING, blizzard gave up long time ago, and certainly not coming back anytime soon with mobile game.
---
Please add at least a single RP-PVP!
---
So far this is exactly their stance. 
---
Ion said no sharding for stuff like Kazzak, there can only be one instance of a world boss being fought for. 
---
Having high traffic and having the server come together and to fight together and against each other is the whole point of world bosses.
---
Having 120people sitting ontop of a level 3 starting zone named mob is not part of what people strife for.
---
O we hidin in the lil naga
---
I made this post yesterday and got ut removed by automod, still bitter
---
I appreciate your criticism (I don't downvote if it's constructive and not trolling). 
---
In our defense though, that wasn't from some random forum but from this very subreddit. Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/
---
Furthermore, I'm not sure from when that picture was taking on WoWprogress, but it's not entirely impossible that the community has changed since then, with more people returning to the game who prefer to play with a more mature crowd. I prefer to look at what the Classic enthusiasts plan to do, rather than look at old data; but to each their own.
---
The name was more of an indication of the types of people that may play on PvP realms (not generalising everyone of course). Typically you'll see more toxicity and griefing in comparison to other realm types. If that's something you don't mind, or heck even prefer, then that's fine with me really. We simply enjoy the game better if it's kept to a minimum, even if that means our realm will not be as highly populated. Besides that, we also want to engage in actual RP events, and there's a lot of people who can tell you how those proceed on PvP realms! Anyway, looking at the census, I find it hard to believe that we cannot maintain 1 rp-pvp realm in both NA and EU.
---
You have to save for months to use flightpaths
---
I used to solo sneak through BRD to the big spider mother. She dropped the druid set boots. Took few runs to get it right and then quite a few goes till the boots dropped.
---
Crbgs is content added to the game, though. It's content that wasn't available until patch 1.12 similar to how naxx wasn't available until 1.11. Its hilarious you shout nochanges, but literally having crbgs in from the start is an INSANELY BIG CHANGE. The no change way would be crbgs added in phase 6 or later. 1.12 is a base, it's not the definitive version we are getting for classic, as per the many blue posts. It's really not hard to understand why people are against having a system implemented into the game that wasn't there for like 90% of the game.
---
Retails population is really of no use when trying to determine vanilla population. I, nor any of my friends would ever consider playing on a vanilla pve server and yet we've all been on retail pve servers for years. World pvp and population imbalance both hit the point of no return and now none of us can be bothered to play on our preferred server type.
---
15 years ago people had no idea what stat does what and how it affects stuff. It's a completely different story now. Yeah, everyone is an idiot here and you're the bringer of light. Thanks, you can fuck off now.
---
so post in patch of exile tag.....
---
yup pretty much everything you said. food, repairs because mail+plate+melee weapon = expensive and also you will have the most deaths of any class. buying weapons. no free mount. and its not a good grinding class, you will be mostly questing, which gives less money. and this doesn't apply to you but on a fresh server warrior won't be ahead of the pack anyway so might as well take skinning.
---
It's all about leverage.
---
Strat UD in which you as tank take the stratholme crates and unneeded Bind on *Pickup*. There is a plethora of weapons to be sold to the vendor and the green level57 BoPs from the ziggurat bosses can grant 1-3 greater eternal essences which sell for 4-10g depending on current economy.
---
All but tank really need stuff from there, so you dont even need a healer, because you will have healers sitting in queue waiting to grind their Robes of the Exalted.
---
So if you are lucky you can get 100g for a 45min run.
---
Why wouldn’t you be able to?
---
They aren't saying they want crbgs removed. They're saying they don't want them in from the start (a huge change btw). Crbgs should be added when needed way down the line, hopefully around phase 6.
---
Barely anyone cleared retail naxx40. Literally less than 100 guilds out of the entire 6 million playerbase.
---
You could offer free tanking services provided you get all mining/herbs in the instance...then you just pick instances that have the good stuff or the stuff that sells good anyway.
---
Or you could  offer tanking services for Strat and get first  Righteous Orb drop or first 2 or whatever...plus mining/herb.
---
Or you could just charge a flat rate.
---
Well I have never played one at naxx gear level, but from what I understand eviscerate scales poorly making other classes able to survive you better and your already poor group fighting becomes worse when you get globaled by the other team
---
A whole lotta anti-pserver rage in your post, lol
---
&gt;code and mechanics ain't scuffed to oblivion
---
The scripting on private servers is very far from "scuffed to oblivion", you'd know if you actually played them.
---
&gt;muh world buffs, world buffs!
---
World buffs are only used when you already have the raid on farm, since they'll just disappear when you die otherwise.
---
&gt;private servera just messed that up?
---
I don't see how players being more prepared and spending time farming consumes for raid is "private server messing it up". Care to elaborate?
---
As for raiding, you should be able to find a situation where you let the leaders know that you are looking for feral dps gear in raids, but are willing to OT/dps/heal as needed for fights.  If you come in with some pretty good pre-raid gear and are consistent, there shouldn't be a problem getting the gear you want - you just have to make sure you have an understanding with the guild leaders beforehand.  
---
I think you have two big factors here.  
---
1)  Are you fine without having a simple gear-progression.  You know the class and know what gear you can get when
---
2)  Your limited time may be an issue here depending on what you are looking to do.  Gathering the gear for tank/dps/heals generally takes a lot more time than gearing with other classes.  Also, for cat dps you have a good bit of farming to pull your weight in raid, which is another time sink.
---
Based on that, if you're worried about the time you'll have to put in, go something else.  If you aren't really worried about the time in 1&amp;2 stick with your go to class!  It's under-represented, you know you enjoy playing the class, and you can single handedly remind people that droods are more valuable than just being a healbot when played correctly. If you do think you want something else, i'd either go war for tank/dps or priest for dps/heals - they both can perform well in their two roles in pve/pvp and imo have some pretty interesting toolkits to keep you entertained.
---
The fact that so many people care so deeply about this warms my heart a little haha. 
---
Demonstrates the waaay higher levels of character investment imo.
---
i think warriors have the most struggle, even if you play dps. You still need basic tank gear, and consumables gets expensive fast, unless you slack on cost for it + repair cost.
---
For lower level warlock it's the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe. I remember wearing it from like 30 something to the low 50's. I got more mileage out of that than any piece of gear in Vanilla.
---
Well aside from the fact its nearly impossible to get for 99% of the player base, more people got naxx gear than hwl and its still worse.
---
That's fair, they were changed a very long time ago and like I said many people make that mistake... or they only have their main classes trinket memorized and just assume everyone elses trinket does the same thing :)
---
More like h24 flight path camp since this wont give much honor because each hk will be split on the whole raid.
---
While leveling you can easily heal without any healing talents as long as you keep some healing hearing your bags
---
Nope
---
WC3 and wh40k
---
I'll give it a hard dicking
---
As all things should be.
---
thanks
---
&gt; Class homogenization didn't really occur until a little bit in Cata, 
---
Maybe you and I mean different things by homogenization because it was already a big problem by Wrath.
---
Its not part of the chain, but I suggest farming the key as it will be highly sought after when the server is crowded and people will often pay for keyholders
---
It would be amazing if it did (even if it just just a 1hr even or something), however.....unlikely :P)
---
Dagger :-(
---
I am having an awful time deciding what I want to play.
---
Right now I deciding between rogue (for wpvp), hunter (ease of leveling and solo), priest (to get end-game raid spots).
---
Do you think people had so much trouble picking a class back in vanilla? Or did they just pick?
---
And here you are totally wrong. I would agree with you when they would use the original 1.12 client but they using new tech (i think it is the Legion client) with the old Data (as seen and explained in the Blizzcon panel).
---
I will bet any amount of gold that there will be Quest that not work, pathfinding of mobs, Buff/Debuffs of mobs that did not exist in Classic or have wrong values or even skills (or CDs) that not work right.
---
This is normal and will happen with such a big Game no problem but thinking they will lunch a perfect game is just stupid.
---
You realize wanting crbgs in from the start is changes right? Most people saying they're against crbgs are doing so in reply to people wanting then in from the start. Crbgs were added to fix a problem, and from the looks of it we won't have that problem with lean servers and everything. But if we do start having queue issues then crbgs can be added at a later stage (phase 6+), how it was in vanilla (nochanges).
---
It's pretty easy, u put exactly 0 point in holy
---
Just a tip, dont choose your class based on rotation in Raids. The time you will be spending doing that is a REALLY low % of your time spent playing the character.
---
Female Blood Elves have a super cool behind-the-back spin animation when using polearms.
---
Great post!
---
Come on Blizzard, please do the right thing. Allow players to have a healthy, diverse number of servers right from the start, including x1 RP-PvP for each region. 
---
it offers an experience that other server types do not. It's not practical for the playerbase to release it later, as your loyal customers require a place they can call home from the beginning and not be pushed to a realm they don't care for.
---
XxX lots of love!
---
You can do just fine in 5 mans but if you only have 2-3 hours in the evening you it's going to be almost impossible to tank in raids, especially if your the MT forget it you have to be ready for every raid from start to finish, with consumables, your repair bill will be high but most guilds will pay for it. 
---
Now if you want to PUG raids like ZG and AQ20 you can do that, and MC when AQ is out and it's old content etc.
---
I forgot, who are you?
---
I've heard DPS can go into MC (your intro raid) in almost questing greens, and that the only people "NEEDING" actual raid ready gear is the main tank and somewhat the main heals
---
The only reputation discount in vanilla and classic is the 10% for honoured, which you'll reach long before getting to 40 for your own race.
---
True, and I'm not against solving those issues. But there are better ways than XR.
---
Exactly. This guy gets #nochanges in regards to crbgs. If they're even needed, this is when they should be implemented.
---
Also Tank service for low level Dungeons were good items drop like SM lib for Int classes or Mara for Plate users.
---
Private servers did not mess world buff server CDs and lotus respawns. Those are changed easily, within 5 minutes, but they chose to do so because you can not compare a server with a 2500 cap where a ton of people don't raid to a server with 12 000 population where most people raid which is also international with several raid times.
---
Back in vanilla top end guilds would get their Dragonslayer buff quite consistently when they needed it, because not many people would have an option to get one and because it would be at an arranged time. Rest of world buffs did not have server CD (except Warchief blessing, horde exlusive). Besides you are forgetting those go away with 1 death and take time to gather.
---
Same deal with lotus spawns.
---
feral druid has the most hands down(pummelers suck), spriest/lock (million mana pots and dark ruines and soulshards respectively on top if flasks etc, tanks have alot, healers, then melee dps and hunters having the least
---
epic pvp gear is more difficult to acquire than aq and naxx gear. and its worse for the majority of specs. so yeah its obsolete. 
---
I have a naxx geared mage, my pvp gear is in the bank rotting.
---
you don't use pvp gear to acquire aq or naxx gear. it is not good in pve for the most part unlike BWL gear. also if it took 4 months of playing 24/7 to acquire BWL gear, I definitely would go straight to AQ.
---
I ran with a guy who was fury pve top dps and pvp he was a nightmare in bgs. Legit I have NO idea how he managed it, but he was godly and never ever used MS. I was a pocket healer for him for most of the game as I recognized the talent and just kept him alive.  
---
Someone who is a warrior expert might be able to put some light on that, but I still have not been able to figure out how he did that. I am planning to roll a War and see if I can become half the player he was in classic.
---
Man that's the easy part. Choosing a class in general is hard, but once chosen, knowing what race to play (for animations) is a no brainer.
---
&gt; "because of DHKs, people trying to rank up will stay in BGs and not raid cities"
---
which means DHKs are serving their purpose.... to reduce the number of towns being camped by raiders. 
---
The argument seems to be that DHKs are worthless unless they 100% eliminate quest giver ganking.
---
This gets my dick Rock Hard.
---
Blizzard, please hear our prayers.
---
private servers can do realm merges just fine, mighty Blizzard should be able to handle it.
---
I wouldnt say theres no need for one.  Theyre essentially rebuilding the game in a client that came out 12+ years after the original.
---
That being said, the quests are the thing i'd be the least worried about.
---
&gt; Sure, but I think more people are for having the honor system, than against it.
---
Why? Why do people need an honor system for pvp?
---
Oh right. They want better gear.
---
Maybe more intellect will help warrior not to roll on the int gear next time.
---
yes but i would consider playing on a PvE server for the first months and every Laptop from the past 5 years should play Classic with no problem. My Girlfriend play on a Lenovo Yoga (around 5 Years old) and can play on Retail
---
It is now.
---
(I'm too lazy to copy-paste it here while on mobile.)
---
You can clear BWL with half your items being blue, having full PvP gear would be one hell of a boost.
---
But yes, when you invite someone to your raid and they're in full PVP gear and weapon. Just replace that obsolete fakker and invite that freshly dinged 60 with green items, he'll do a lot better!
---
I did ZF on my warlock at least a dozen times during vanilla. I never once had it bug out. Someone must have been standing on the cages for you if it did.
---
Warrior definitely has the steepest curve for acquiring gear. Due to how the rage mechanic works (you gain more rage the more damage you do, or the more damage you take) and the role of the warrior (tank or DPS) you will have to farm 2 sets of gear. During leveling this isn't so bad, but when you hit max level you should be trying to get a high +defense/stam/agi/str set for tanking and a high str/hit/crit set for dps. Most of the pieces you want will be dropping in various 5 and 10 man content - Lower/Upper Blackrock Spire,  Blackrock Depths, Scholomance, and both Live and Dead Stratholme. 
---
With 2-3 hours a night available you should be able to do it, but only if you organize ahead of time. Spend your leveling time meeting people and establishing good relationships. Find people with a similar schedule as you and try to make groups ahead of time. Otherwise you'll be pugging and wasting at least 1 hour of your time trying to form a group.
---
Sure, what’s wrong with that?
---
Sounds like the best bet for models and animations would be human!
---
Lucky for you, they also happen to be the best hands down.
---
&gt;These people will lose their shit when some trash mob of the same level kills them in a couple shots.
---
This doesn't happen though. Not even with elites unless you're talking raid trash.
---
I watched the trailer and picked dwarf hunter
---
I don’t feel it’s an insanely big change, it’s still 10v10, 15v15 and 40v40. Only change is there will be a ton more games going on and will be much easier to get into a game.
---
The one thing I'm going to miss is having the dual spec function.
---
Most current gaming laptops will run classic wow fine and why wouldn’t you be able to play the game 1-2 hours 3-4 days a week? It’ll take you a while to hit 60 and I don’t think I could see you raiding at all with those times but plenty of people play wow casually.
---
Bro I have a work trip that weekend and leave on the 21st. It is absolutely guaranteed that if it drops in June it'll be on that day.
---
I didn't meet any single person in my pug runs in the last few years on pservers that would roll need on an item that is not for them only because it has a bit of stamina or spirit. Everyone (a very limited amount of selfish individuals) using this logic will get fucked by the community.
---
[Be careful what you wish for.] (https://i.imgur.com/gEqVx7W.jpg)
---
You have devolved off of the mad ladder.
---
You have now been placed on the pathetic ladder.
---
And voice emotes. You’re going to hear a lot of “I can’t case that yet” or “I need more mana” or “I’m out of range”.
---
Perfect balance for the Horde would be 0/333 HP 😂
---
Florida is a real life Stranglethorn Vale
---
Keys would be a good thing to get... and if your skinning just ninja some Devilsaur leather too....
---
I think people say this because most Guild only need 2-4 Tanks (2 of them a spare and mostly twinks) so you have just limited slots on a server for raids. 
---
But you can always switch to DPS specc and then raid. I would say 3 hours a day (if its everyday) is enough to level "fast" enough to get into the first raids depending on drop luck and so on
---
I want to play hunter but am curious, do they fall-off in pvp or just pve in aq40/naxx?
---
&gt; Sure, what’s wrong with that?
---
Nothing, but you don't need an honor system to get better gear.
---
Always create your own groups for instances. I wouldn't invite anyone at 17 unless they were a healer. 
---
Honestly, creating your own groups means you almost never wipe(if you are competent at assembling the group)..
---
I find human a bit too boring personally, and I really dislike the 2h special animation since it looks really bad if you do it in motion. 
---
Maybe Horde? I like Orc model and animation but I just dont like the horde in general so I dunno...
---
the #nochanges already got broken by Blizz so i do not see why people still using it.
---
This....so much this.
---
I really do believe that even if the starting zones are sharded, there will still be a ton of players in each shard so you will still have that community feeling and feel immersed in the zone. Having 500+ people waiting for respawns would be horrible.
---
Ok lets do it your way.
---
&gt;Sharding in any way and loot trading in any way is against the spirit of vanilla
---
Look at how far we’ve come!
---
You're a stupid mantra.
---
I think the feeling of achievement will be new to these people. They may not enjoy the grind though. 
---
My 1st character was a hunter, and I remember running Strathholme countless times to get 2 of these so I had pre-MC BIS weapons. The joy when it finally dropped was awesome. Same with the 1st time killing Rags as a group, best boss killing feeling I had (closely followed by the LK).
---
Nah I mostly just played TBC and vanilla, you could do raid quests but not the regular ones
---
I mean we'll see I guess. but from my experience without rankers the battlegrounds are very dead. most people world pvp for fun, not bg. wsg might be the exception, but even that has a lot less games and no good premades after aq patch.
---
As a Canadian I’m not sure how I feel being a night elf.
---
Even if it doesn't, I hope you have a good day.
---
&gt;It's a completely different story now. 
---
I like how people like you pick and choose what aspects of the game have changed, its always fun to see the mental gymnastics. 
---
Negative aspects of the community? Well of course they changed, it was 15 years ago!
---
Positive aspects? Well of course they will be the same because that's how it was in vanilla.
---
And you make just as much sense as that chaos ladder people keep talking about. Stop dem drugs, your brain is starting to freeze up.
---
#slipperlyslope
---
Just been such a long time away from the game, was concerned playing very sparingly wouldnt really be viable.
---
I was expecting a Rick roll. I am actually upset
---
I'm actually doing that in June for final fantasy xiv (it was my go to once it hit beta and I quit WoW for it.) But now I kinda wanna take that back so I can use those 2 weeks for classic  since I'll be jumping ship now.
---
I guess it's for twinking characters, where you target certain pieces of loot that you need to get as a BiS. Still, even in this situation, I think it's better to go through soft loot reserve and just don't take any class that wants that item.
---
The ominous sign the previous tank quit in frustration...
---
thanks, I totally agree, cant see me raiding. Maybe only Ony as its a short raid...but couldnt spare the 4-5hrs that MC or BWL took back in the day.  Even UBRS used to take a few hours for a full run.
---
Whether or not you actually plan to play on a RP-PvP sever, showing support and enthusiasm for engagement within the Classic community can never be the wrong move.
---
I hope to see all of your beautiful faces in Azeroth one day. Untill then, stay safe and be positive.
---
People just realized the power of rolling a tank and the fact that they can dictate the rules.
---
Ok, and how do we agree on what the "spirit" of vanilla was?
---
No. It also depends on how they roll out hinterlands
---
You have ranked back up to the mad ladder!
---
Nothing, all these people forget that Blizzard bans for harassment. On a pserver these things would have been an issue but no one is going to pay a subscription and risk getting banned because the player being camped reported them.
---
great, thanks. I played on Argent Dawn, which was a role playing server so never went full PVP. I loved questing on my hunter, and healing in 5 man on my resto-shammy back in the day. so really putting in serious thought to getting myself a gaming laptop and level casually when Classic is released.
---
I mean, im not a fan of the mission table really, but its more than that lol
---
Granted, the gold rewards still arent worth it, but its something like 30x that much.
---
Rep is at least 7.5x as much, and often times more like 60x as much if its for CoA rep....30x+ as much for the others.
---
This was a great read, I look forward to these types of shenanigans.  Thanks for sharing!
---
&gt; Retails population is really of no use when trying to determine vanilla population. 
---
Not the population but rather the general interest of people in these types of realms. If you're seeing that 2/3 of your retail's RP population tends to go PvE, you're going to have second doubts about an RPPVP realm. 
---
And a survey is hardly relevant, even one that's taken here on Reddit. It might escape us every now and then that we live in a pretty small bubble when it comes to the overall population. Like the petition shows, people can talk and scream and give you the impression that RP-PvP is deifinitely "a thing" but when push comes to shove to sign a petition and get involved to even **have** a realm where they can play on they're nowhere to be found. That's why I think retail numbers are more relevant than surveys - about 1.5k people vote in a survey that they want to play on RPPVP and only 500 can be bothered to do a few clicks to even get those realms in the span of a few months after you've spammed this on more channels and way longer than that surveys been spammed as far as I can tell. 
---
A lot of people are all talk, don't place too much confidence in that.
---
Yeah look at the game play, buffs, consumables etc of videos from those people.
---
This. Kamehameha.
---
It takes about 11 full Naxx clears for it, plus minus one or two weeks depending on luck and add some week depending on clearing speed. 
---
So on average it would be around 3 months. Based on this list 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8kcgtt/the_real_list_of_59_useu_guilds_that_cleared_naxx/, from those 131 guilds probably most of them made 1 atiesh.
---
So is needing on blackcrow as rogue or warrior
---
If I hadn't played the demo I'd probably agree with you, but the demo is almost shockingly unpolished and buggy. It's clear that even though they have a working reference client, they still need testing and feedback. I don't think that definitely means they'll have a beta, but it's very much in the realm of possibility.
---
Well I guess I can't say "[I'm never gonna let you down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj1ykZWtPYI)"
---
I definitely think you guys should have your RP-PvP realm. I do have an issue with some of the calls for them, though.
---
Some people seem to want to play on RP-PvP over PvP realms, not out of a desire for RP, but out of a desire for a more "mature" player community. That is not what those realms are about. It is about people who wish to RP, who will NEVER contribute to breaking other people's immersion, and who will RP at least from time to time. If what you want is not to RP, then you have no business being on RP realms.
---
I intend to take an "RP approach" to naming my character, in that it will at least have a name that fits the race I am playing, and isn't immersion breaking if any RPer sees it. I also would like to play with a more mature community of players. This is not enough for me to play on any type of RP realm. I will be rolling on PvP, and community maturity there will be whatever it is.
---
By discussing what aspects of the game made vanilla great, and how we can keep those things alive.
---
Loot trading is a perfect example.  There was a problem (lack of GMs today at Blizzard), and the devs had to make a change to the game. To quote Kaivax: "We wanted to keep loot trading in WoW Classic because the end result is the same – the correct person gets the item – and it’ll save everyone time." 
---
This is a logical change that makes sense, solves the problem, and remains within the framework of how the original devs intended for the game to be played. "Preserve Vanilla", not "NO CHANGES!"
---
It is possible to disable those messages, they are known as "Error speech" and can be found under the audio menu :)
---
This guy *mantras*.
---
&gt; Only change is there will be a ton more games going on and will be much easier to get into a game.
---
And a huge blow to the pvp community on each server. 
---
&gt; 1.12 is a base. They first thing listed on that patch notes base is cross realm bgs.
---
Yes a base, as stated by blizz, where they will work backwards and achieve a more authentic vanilla experience. Idk which game you played, but when I was playing in 2004-6 crbgs weren't a part of WoW for the majority of the game, minus 4months (Aug 22 - Dec 5th) at the tail end.
---
Hopefully crbgs won't be necessary, but if they are, then they shouldn't be added until at a later phase (like in vanilla).
---
Warrior tanks still need DPS gear to farm.
---
/r/outside
---
not sure exactly how events panned out, it was a mistake on the group setting as they were screaming at everyone to not click need but he did it at the last second and won. was a Crab People group on talnivarr-eu could maybe still find info on it from back then.
---
Spot on
---
I think I can answer this as a PvPer, but not as a classic expert. They just dont scale in PvE. Hunter utility in PvP is what makes them good. Hunters mark, traps, and having further range than casters
---
Female druids are non-canon.
---
It's not about honor...
---
Less populated than 1 guild vs another? what? There were like 100 people there.
---
We are forming a PvE-guild full off ppl with lifes, kids, companies etc. We know so much more about the game now and no more playing with crappy ping etc so we are confindent that we will be able to see everything even though we will only raid twice a week, 3h a raid.
---
Hi, /u/Ekazz1989
---
People are discussing these sort of issues every day, multiple times per day and no one can ever come to an agreement.
---
The "spirit" of vanilla is going to be very different for each type of player that you ask, and none of them are wrong.
---
Making changes to the games based on what you think vanilla was all about is going to piss off a lot of people
---
It happens but if I know I have a shadowpriest, or dps shaman, I will gladly take a druid healer. In my experience they do really well healing during the 1-59 leveling. 
---
The only time I am hesitant on no rez is if the dungeon is super long and the death walk might break the group.
---
Depends on where you spawn to be fair
---
Some people argue that troll is the best warrior race in the game if youre a tank. Since berserking only gets its full potential when youre at low hp
---
Getting DFT on a rogue. Alternatively, getting Perditions Blade and Renatakis Charm of Trickery.
---
Unfortunately I didn't raid with him when he got it, he was in A-team on Stonemaul-US.  I was forced to another server due to getting busted ninja looting too many times, lol.  Ended up raiding on alliance on Spirestone for a while then went Horde on Turalyon. Got about half of Naxx cleared and got to Twin Emps in AQ50 before TBC dropped.  Best guild on Turalyon was alliance though, Illumination.
---
I had lots of trouble picking a main. I got most classes to at least 30 (which included a lot of no-xp gain pvp) before I dedicated enough to get my warrior to 52 that I abandoned to get my pally to 60. I think just pick the class that will yield the best results across the most aspects that you care about. For me I was huge on battlegrounds which is what drove me to main paladin over warrior because they were so much more versatile (also reckoning was one of my favorite things ever)
---
For my guild the focus is on PvE, PvP and RP. RP definitely comes second to raiding though. My guildies are dedicated to RP on varying levels, and I would never force everyone to have an elaborate backstory and walk in cities just because we are on a RP-PvP realm. As long as people don't disturb RPers and their events (which is against our guild CoC) I don't think we need to ask too many questions about their intentions. Some have never RPed before, but just want to try out an event sometime. If they end up not liking it I see no reason to immediately unwelcome them from the realm. RP-PvP in that sense just is a bit more accesible to newcomers in comparison to RP imo.
---
Hell yeah, Tauren Shaman. It was at that moment I knew that I was Horde at heart.
---
mhm
---
Then the “community “ takes a hit then. 
---
More games &gt; community. 
---
Blizzard didn’t seem think it was a big deal.
---
Am I being stupid for picking shaman over druid for thinking that I'll have an easier time getting into PUG raids/dungeons?
---
Specs I'm comparing are HOTW druid and ele/resto shaman. I played a druid most of WoW, but dread the thought of not finding dungeon groups because of the lack of a res, and not being wanted to PUG heal raids because of the low throughput.
---
&gt;still better to see for yourself and not take everyones word that "yeah, im HC, great player and cleared all content" on some forum guild
---
I believe I literally said that here https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bdxs08/me_after_shadowfang_keep_run_with_randoms/el1t4ea/?context=3
---
Sometimes IRL professions let you press the "Create All" button and then talk to strangers on reddit about fake video game professions.
---
my goal is to have 1 main and 1 alt, but spend most of the time on my main maxing out professions and raiding
---
Racials needs a rework since they are very imbalanced since the colonization update.
---
The picture was taken 3 weeks ago in [a thread on barrens.chat](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1192&amp;p=5890&amp;hilit=RP+PvP#p5890). 
---
I don't think that survey shows what people want to do as much as it shows what they say they want to do. Realistically speaking, around 2/3 of those who signed on that survey couldn't be bothered to sign the petition as well which kind of shows what I've been wanting to say: RPPvP comes with like a lot of sound but with very few people behind it. 
---
To give an analogy: I'm recruiting for a WPvP-PvE guild. If you ask every guild master out there what they think about WPvP events, town raids and everything - they'll say "yeah, they're awesome, such an iconic part of vanilla, sure we'll have them every now and then" - but really, who does? Maybe they'll get a raid together once, rush through SW and die at the gates, call it a day. My guild is [the only one with WPvP anywhere in its description](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e7nMh8IaH5mNZ7MOx2it8MF7ULYdCIT0VqO6ubaUDq4/edit#gid=0), plan, intent etc. 
---
I feel it might be the same case for RP-PvP. Sounds fun in theory, but at the end of the day a lot of folks are probably going to stick to either RP (cause they're afraid of P2 Vietnam) or PvP (cause they don't want their realms to die and/or they want PvP and/or most guilds are going there anyway). 
---
If you could somehow show that some good raiding guilds are going to be going there and/or the realms aren't going to die off and/or it won't be an imbalanced vietnam everywhere in P2, I think people are going to feel a lot different and join your cause in greater numbers.
---
Shamans have some mobility. Don’t forget ghost wolf and the fact they hadn’t nerfed frost shock yet. You can  have a single target continuously slowed because the duration of frost shocks slow lasted longer than it’s cool down.
---
This tripped me out more than it should have
---
&gt; but I believe sharding is a portmanteu of two words
---
The origin is from some old mmo, I think Ultima, where the servers/realms were called "shards".
---
+1 for using the word dope in place of cool. Lets keep that word alive. 
---
In other news, i dont recall what ud female animations look like, so ima look them up.
---
Honestly, you don't need to spend any time farming consumables.  In vanilla wow no one used consumables.  Many people would log in just before raid time and log out right after.  Unless you are trying to clear Naxx as fast a possible the only farming you probably need to do is for gold to pay repair bills.
---
Brilliant!
---
Yeah, I guess you are right. The attitude just annoys me, because I imagine some number of those people would eventually ruin RP for others, and not care that they are doing it.
---
Lol wow I didn’t even realize this. Now it really must happen!!
---
I'm not super interested personally in a RP-PVP realm, but I think everyone should feel like they have a home to come back to so I think it's worth making some noise around this.  It's low cost for Blizzard and it won't affect your gameplay if it's not your thing.
---
Thanks :) you too!
---
I just dont like the part where they stick their face in their own spell before casting it.
---
You know the one.
---
On the other hand, Warriors have the easiest time getting groups for 5-mans.
---
We also want the parts that didn't made vanila great. We want vanilla. The good with the bad. But loot trading was something the gm staff could fix but we can't have that now. So these changes are needed.
---
Ironically the most dragon ball z type animation in the game.
---
My favorite part was when you said RP-PvP servers were important to most players. Maybe most that play on them.
---
New technology Blizzard introduced in retail WoW. If you get more than a certain amount of players in an area they get split off into two "shards", which is essentially just another temporary server. So if there are a total of 500 players in Elwynn Forest they may be split into 5 different shards, to make questing possible. 
---
I think Blizzard has already confirmed they will be using this for low level zones on launch. There was some debate here about it when it was announced. Some people hate the idea, others (like me) think it's a better solution than the alternatives.
---
I have never played on an RP server (or even much on PVP servers) during retail wow, but I'm completely on board for going RP-PVP this time around. It sort of feels like the "whole package" of every aspect of the game. I think interest in both RP and PVP servers is significantly higher than it was during retail (there were more PVE servers than any other server type back then, at least in NA) and hopefully the realm type balance reflects that. Give us at least one RP-PVP please!
---
I want to roll a warrior too. Mostly because I dont want to sit in IF for 45 mins looking for a tank for stuff. I want to dps/off tank for raids, not main tank. I also only have 2-3 hours a night to play (if im lucky) My only saving grace is my wife, who wants to roll a healy priest.
---
You are a little bit late to the party. It's not like your post will change anything at this point. If you want to have a good discussion for the sake of it it's not a good idea to call the opposite argument "stupid" from the very beginning. You painted yourself as immature.
---
Female taurens are pretty damn ugly, however I love their casting animations.
---
yeah but we also have more than 1000+ gold for our bis crafted and BoE gear.
---
How was that taken 3 weeks ago when PvP realms don't excist in retail anymore? Also, comparing current retail with Classic is beyond absurd if you ask me.
---
Maybe more agility will help him get away with it.
---
It is not what I personally think vanilla was about, it is what the original devs thought vanilla was about.
---
What I'm getting at here is are we just going to ignore all the changes that happened post 1.12? When in reality "TRUE VANILLA" (the phrase the #nochanges crowd loves to throw out all the time) had TONS of changes!
---
You can join me in the couple hours, a few times a week club. It’s more pve, exploration and dungeon running, but can be solo or social as desired, and still a lot of fun (IMO).
---
It will be easier to get a raid invite as a shaman, over a druid. However, as a druid, you can easily tank dungeons, and heal them (It's kinda difficult to get invited if the group doesn't have another class that can res, like a priest/pally/sham/etc). I can't give you any information as to how pug raids would be though, as either class. I've never pug raided before.
---
Nochanges always was broken and many people used it not really knowing what it meant (because it does t really mean anything specific). It was like the wall of no used on forums, people just parrot what they saw.
---
It all seems very logical. When it takes longer to level, you cant just ignore stuff that irks you as easily and you want to pick the thing you like most.
---
Problem is there are animations, aesthetics, racial bonuses, limitations of race/class combo, etc. so we have to think carefully, heh.
---
Not to hijack the thread, but this is exactly what I’m looking for, do you have a discord or something to keep up with people who’re joining you?
---
Thats great and the laptop should be that expensive, just look out that it has a real Graphic card (not a intel one) should cost around 300€ new or a used on for half of it.
---
But I like it when they talk to me :(
---
&gt;Most of the people out there know the stats which gear is most optimal.
---
Its not about optimal vs not optimal, its about better vs worse. 
---
If its an improvement people will need it.
---
Wait, Australia doesn't exist! 😁
---
Male troll enhance shaman: for those glorious windfury spins!
---
&gt; Why would they worry where they end up in the first few days.
---
Cause it's not fun waiting around for a quest item/mob to respawn.
---
Many ≠ most...
---
Watch Skarm’s BiS video. He says not to buy all that stuff.
---
Now tell us dishonestly
---
I will never forget the [Shadow's over Khaz Modan](https://theventureco.fandom.com/wiki/Shadows_Over_Khaz_Modan) campaign on Venture Co. Best RP PvP I've ever been a part of. Memories for the rest of my life. Good times.
---
Play literally whatever you want, just don't  lick windows while doing it and you'll find a home.
---
Sorry, not trying to call other people out. We all love the same game!
---
I'm just trying to get people to think twice about the way they give feedback about the development process going on right now.
---
Eh, lack of a rez isn't that big of a deal. It's kind of annoying, but it really just means a little running if no one else in the group can rez. HotW druid can be a lot of fun because you have lots of options. If you're healing, both druid and shaman get into casual raids pretty readily and neither have any problems in dungeons.
---
That said, I'm going for shaman myself. Heals well and has great burst for PvE DPS or PvP.
---
I’m sorry 1.5k players max isn’t many, and that’s if you got lucky and had that many people on it. It’s for the best, the server will die out. I honestly want everyone to have a server to their liking but it’s not necessary like you’re trying to make it seem.
---
Implying that there aren't people in other countries who work/play the same schedules I mentioned....
---
It will not be a thing
---
They have at least talked about sharding, not entirely sure if they are 100% decided on it, but that's what it looks like now. Dynamic respawns they have either not talked about or said they don't want to do.
---
༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ Summon release date ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ
---
I'm intrested about this aswell.
---
Also the commant to loggout+reset dungeon to teleport you back to the entrance. I would like to know if that still works.
---
And how do you plan on figuring out what was the vision of original devs? Noone of them work at blizzard anymore, all we can do is make guesses and assumtions.
---
I was talking about peoples knowledge about the game, not how the game changed itself.
---
Totally fine as well, I misunderstood your message as frustration my bad :)
---
Change is how you get wrath of the lich king. Change is also how you get cataclysm talents. Mist of pandaria.. and to my regrets warlords of draenor.
---
Depending on the dungeon it is a good suggestion, especially if you know your class and can be relied upon. Little mercenary RP is actually quite nice.
---
Yeah of course! Can't say I'm suprised, just nice to see.
---
And that's true, I'm lucky that my class/race combo was the easiest pick. I was a Nelf Hunter back in the day. Although my favourite was later a warrior on PServers, hunter was always close and I also played Horde. So Ally is both the most 'fresh' and nostalgic experience for me - EASY.
---
There's but one question: Do I go for my new habit of making EVERY character name a witty pun? Or do I rebirth Neirel: The Night Elf Huntard who spent 200G in TBC finding all the green - As in literal colour - Mail on the AH so he could look like some forest ranger.
---
I'm struggling between paladin and druid right now. While I am focused on end game raiding, I am also interested in playing a class that is self sufficient in terms of farming, wpvp, and bgs. As druid I would run HOTW hybrid, and look to tank dungeons while healing and offtanking in raids. I know druids fall off a bit during BWL progression due to poor gear choices, but other than that raid I should be fine to offtank a lot of stuff. My concern is the bias against druid tanks (even though I would farm manual crowd pummelers for insane threat generation) and the even lower healing throughput from being HOTW spec.
---
Paladin is my other choice, but they have less options for farming and are more reliant on others in wpvp and bgs. Also, leveling a paladin is like pulling teeth. However, its considerably easier to get a raid spot and paladin healing is a lot of fun for me. I might be able to run a holy / prot sanc build which would make farming a lot easier, but at the end of the day I would be a lot more group reliant.
---
Anyone else struggling with a similar decision that have some advice?
---
Sorry but it is my duty to look for good porn while playing Ret pala!
---
there's no need to fix it because the bug did not exist in vanilla in the first place
---
"frontstabbing" is entirely a private server thing, and always will be
---
&gt;  In ZG you have the best heal neck at that stage, 
---
Isn't neck from Ossi head better?
---
&gt; Then the “community “ takes a hit then. 
---
Exactly. The community will take a hit once crbgs are added in, no matter which way you look at the issue. Blizz said they will be doing "lean" servers, meaning fewer servers to disperse to, resulting in better populations on each server. 
---
This could completely remove the need for crbgs, until a much later phase, which I, and most everyone else on this sub, is fine with, since it stays true to how blizz has stated they will handle things, and have handled things in the past. No matter which way you look at it, crbgs in from the start is a massive change, crbgs in at a later point when they are needed, is not a massive change.
---
Well it isn't straight up guesses, we do have historical patch notes.
---
yes YOU CAN, just make it crossrealm-bg and make it so pugs will fight other pugs and premades fight agains other premades, problem = solved.
---
I didn't meet this kind of scumbags although ran quite a lot of dungeons in Vanilla and TBC.
---
Did they? Is this your first time on this subreddit?
---
Cross-realm =/= Battlegroups
---
Thunderbluff fits well in the US somewhere imo. Lots of bulls/bison, and the Native American spirituality plays into the Tauren spirituality.
---
You get the herbalism speed increase as a Tauren right?
---
I can’t confirm you are right neither wrong but I hope you are!
---
Correct, and even then they were split up to be east coast, central, west coast, eastern EU, Western EU, etc.
---
The battlegroups were split up regionally. To go one step further, they should not pair PvE and PvP realms together for Classic Battlegroups.
---
RP-PvP is my server of choice.  Myself and my guild have decided that is where we are playing, and if it isn't even an option come launch, there is going to be a split between those favouring mostly RP and those favouring PvP with no room for partaking in both realistically.
---
Really? Is that why people always find weird ways to play any game?
---
All of Dark Souls runs, FPS on bananas and shit.
---
So are you saying you don't want any of the changes that occurred throughout the life cycle of vanilla WoW to be added to the game?
---
That is an other interesting question !
---
Frontstabbing is a private server thing, so no.
---
[Mara princess rock ](https://huntsmanslodge.com/images/diy_49_twink_hunter.jpg) 
---
Hey mate, hopefully that opens up correctly. 
---
The rock top right of the picture, the rocks basically a hexagon. You tank her very close up against the wall moving her between two or three if you want corners of choice eg A B. 
---
Moving to  A  dps. She pulses at A
---
You move to B and wait out of LoS and without being hit from the pulse. 
---
She moves to you at B dps. She pulses again. 
---
You move back around that slight corner to A shift if need HoT back to bear and continue etc. 
---
It’s not hunter quick, it’s slow till you get some gear but safe.

I don’t even have pserver client downloaded anymore or I’d fraps it for you mate.

You're a liar. He didn't say that, nor did he imply it. It isn't inn there.

Get out.

well you get lionhearts helm as both dps and tank, its bis the whole game. TPS and DPS

Indeed haha ! Thank you for the info !
---
1500 people already indicated as such, on reddit only, many months before it's supposed to launch. I'm not saying I expect tens of thousands, but don't be so naive...
---
Sorry, tried to climb it but you got there first :/
---
For a moment i tought it was the full map of azeroth xD

Interesting how private server flood our memory of misinformations..!

---
I used the wrong word sorry about that. Kinda in the same way you said “inn” instead of “in” :) 
---
I think my point still stands. He made a huge whine post about a server that would MAYBE have 1.5k pop. I hope they add an RP-PvP server but to be realistic I don’t think it will happen.

I can imagine be being SO FCKIN READY !!! :D

---
The irony is that front stabbing existed back in vanilla but most people just didn't know about it , the reason you can't do it in classic wow is because blizzard integrated the updated character movements that were introduced in post-wotlk.
---
Sorry but if you play to hit 60 in the first week, something is very wrong in your life.
---
This is what happens when a release date hasn't been announced yet.
---
You aren't likely to remember it because the worst examples, like +str on a caster, only happened at low levels when you had very few gearing options.
---
But what about things like hunters needing melee weapons, rogues/warriors taking hunter weapons, healers taking dmg/healing armor? Things like that happened all the time, and all of them basically follow "someone else needs it more than I do".
---
This.
---
Time constraints being a functional adult, paired with that Rank 13 gives shoulders and helmet.
---
As an ele shaman, deep earth spaulders are far better for damage and Helmet of Ten Storms is not only vastly easier to aquire, looks better (style points) and is stat wise comparable.
---
Its the Champion gloves / chest with the General's Legs and Boots im after. It just so happens those 4 items all give the most SP between the two sets.
---
Found the shill for Big Mercator.
---
Endgame raiding and PvP seems fun tho..
---
Lupos probably won’t have shadow damage as it was removed in patch 1.9. Differing attack speeds should be in, as they were in 1.12.
---
The only way to know for sure is to wait for release, of course.
---
Sorry man, we gotta do what we gotta do. Lesson learned from the good folk that spoke up for spell batching and against loot trading.
---
Guilds will have to work together to ensure that people ruining events don't have a chance to grow on the realm :)
---
Yup. I've finally landed on male undead rogue over female orc rogue. I don't mind how the sets look on a male undead but God those shoulders on a female undead are dreadful. Also based on the starting zones. In my group of 4 it will be 3 undead and an orc or if our 5th manages to get money together for a new rig in time it will be 3 undead and 2 orcs. Just hoping for a release date when I'm on holiday as I can't book time off. That way we will be having a good week long Lan
---
That's not what the modding community is/does, though. :V
---
Keep climbing, pud! You can do it!
---
Compromise?  
---
For Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin why not have each faction composed of only 1 server. So 10 Alliance from say Stormrage would fight 10 Horde from Illidan. This would allow you to build a meaningful community with those you are queued with, while ensuring queues are still somewhat reasonable.  
---
While I agree it's pretty awesome to find that one person that you absolutely destroyed in WSG 15 minutes ago out in the world, the true community won't be found like that, it would be in same faction bonding and cooperation.
---
this guy is 100% spot on, vanilla had patches ergo buff all of the classes I like, add in new raids, re-itemize everything, delete 3 races at random, and if you don't want any of this you're just stupid and need to use LOGIC and REASON
---
Some say that their warriors possess a gift, I mean yeah the huge shoulders are nice, but that’s not what I mean...some say they can gank from the shadows like a rogue, but they do so forgoing the use of toothpicks for weapons...
---
*Laughs in shadowmeld*
---
So, does that make Japan Kul Tiras?
---
Can't, some druggie is in the way =/
---
Its good and all but not being able to choose a starting point is a real bummer.
---
Like I said you need to read it again, its going to be in a pre 1.10 state for the most part. The direct relevent quote is " Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the  biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a  sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was  introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It  also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make  room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most  heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch,  and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War  Effort. Prior to the Ahn’Qiraj unlock, most of the drop rates and  locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with  exceptions—there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that  don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re  planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations."
---
Did I say that?
---
Female undead. Doing frontflips for days.
---
I watched an old trailer that showed some pvp in WoW's early development. It looked a LOT like Warcraft 3 at that point
---
I want to try a different approach here. Basically, try to convince me to change my mind from the class I want to play. If you can't, I know I've found the right one. 
---
I want to:
---
* Not struggle to find groups while leveling and/or at 60
---
* Tank end game content
---
* Be a killing machine in group PvP
---
* Do OK in world pvp (I'm still not sure about PvE or PvP servers, so this doesn't hold as much weight.
---
Right now I finally think I've settled on playing a warrior. Change my mind. Or confirm my decision. That will make me happy lol.
---
This comes from a post on mmo-champion; can’t say if it is official or not :-O
---
The difference between us is that your post strawmans someone else's opinion, while mine does no such thing.
---
His post was not a "whine". There is nothing whiney about it. He says what he wants, and why, and why he thinks there are enough people for such realms to exist.
---
You can disagree with him, and I won't mind. Misrepresenting him and trying to belittle him is pretty shitty, though.
---
It was basically a site for memes before memes existed
---
The vision of the original devs doesn't matter. We want what we had, back. Not some imaginary version of the game that could have been. The original devs probably wanted to do all sorts of stuff they couldn't back then, doesn't mean we want it now. 
---
You're also being super pedantic about the term "no changes". Everyone here knows that no changes means some changes. We're well aware that the game was updated from 1.0 to 1.12. That's not what #nochanges means whatsoever. It means that we don't want anything added that would fundamentally change the game we want. We already know tiny things like shift-clicking mail messages will make it in, so yes, that's a change. But it's completely meaningless in the grand scope of the game. What you're describing *is a different game*.
---
Trust me it did not exist back in vanilla. I had a level 60 rogue and druid and I'm sure everyone at least tried to get creative and backstab by hopping around and trying to mess up the hitbox, it never ever worked. If it was possible back then people would have figured it out real quick.
---
You were wrong tho
---
Yeah, the Alliance might stand a chance fighting corpses.
---
I assumed from your post that you do not want any changes to 1.12. My assumption may be wrong. How do you think the dev team should approach changes to 1.12?
---
I have no intention what so ever to play RP-PVP. I will however support those who want to do this in getting them their servers anyway I can. I thought it weird when they announced it was too niche.
---
Why wouldn’t you be able to?  You need them for flask of the Titans (stonescale oil)
---
Maybe it’s because you were wrong and they knew!
---
Whose turn is it tomorrow to make this post?
---
So very wrong. And yes, I played in Vanilla (off-tank) and actually used full consumeables, even in MC and BWL.
---
I think they should learn from the failures of WoW after its golden age of wotlk. The biggest boner killer for me, and my guild who almost entirely quit during cataclysm, was talents. Sure most talents were cookie cutter but you COULD experiment with different builds.
---
You could both be right in some way.   
---
"We are glad to announce WoW Classic will release on 14th May"

"...2020"
---
Yes, but paladins farm fine. What are you trying to do, kill massive amounts of mobs for money? Solo instances? Try holy prot and you can kill fine. Not great like a hunter or mage but you can certainly do it. Especially if you go to somewhere like WPL where you can make good use of exorcism. You can use seal of light and wisdom to keep your mana up, or damage seals and drink here and there.  Leveling a paladin isn't THAT bad. I think leveling a shaman is much worse.  
---
Anyway, here's an awesome picture of how to level each class optimally [https://imgur.com/a/aNm8V#5](https://imgur.com/a/aNm8V#5) HTH
---
If I were you, I'd pick a play style you like along with what YOUR actual goals are. If you ABSOLUTELY are convinced you're going to work very hard and make it to Naxx and have a good crew to run with, then you want to go paladin.
---
You'll have to put more work into a druid for hybrid stuff, but if you LOVE druid, you'll LOVE doing it. That's what it comes down to really is what makes you more excited to log in and play. 
---
Sounds like the only thing keeping you from going pally is some thought that they can't farm, and I would get past that and group up with a warrior or others. You'll make more money running strat live for orbs as a pally than you will out killing mobs as a druid...but maybe I'm missing your other plans. Either way, pally can make money. They are also the best PvP healer in the game.
---
So what's MY hangup?  I don't want to wear cloth as a paladin, it ruins the entire experience for me.
---
ill give him 5g towards the epic mount
---
(I'm not really into maps.)[https://xkcd.com/977/]

---
&gt;*  Not struggle to find groups while leveling and/or at 60
---
* Do OK in world pvp (I'm still not sure about PvE or PvP servers, so this doesn't hold as much weight.)
---
Roll a warlock. You never said you had to tank end game content *well*.
---
Have fun with warrior and get a friend to help you get WW Axe ASAP. :)
---
Nope sorry but if it was still a Blizzard stock maybe but the ties to Activision are way to heavy now. I would rather buy Sony stock because of the Ps5 but even they are way to big with the TV and Electronic market
---
Or they announce that they're shelving the game, and you've cursed us all.
---
How is what I'm describing an entirely different game? 
---
I think we are getting at the same idea here. That simple changes, which do no fundamentally change the game, should be added to the classic WoW servers.
---
I can't pick between dwarf Pala and human. Dwarf healing animation is better, but there's still thy classic wow Hobbs Pala tank look I enjoy, not to mention for Ret humans have an edge.
---
Fighting Rogues drives me insane in classic. What class should I roll?
---
People run way too many BGs to get rewards.
---
If there were no rewards people would play for the fun of it and 24h AVs would not be a problem.
---
Take away the epics from raids, I would do them once and just do dungeons after that.
---
Yeah nobody (DPS wise) really has a very interesting rotation in raids. The mechanics of the fight, utility abilities, movement and positioning, etc. are what makes it fun.
---
Hunters are always fun in PvP if you get good at kiting and joust clipping. Get into a good timing for your autoshot and learn to SS/FD/Trap effectively and you'll be golden.
---
just letting you know I read your whole post and appreciate your thought on it!
---
ahah just because you don't like Activision doesn't make it a good buy opportunity.
---
Lionheart wasn't released until patch 1.11.1.  Should be phase 6 which has Naxx release.
---
Healer paladins or healer shamans aren't gonna have a hard time getting raid spots.
---
&gt; We should be finding the best pieces of Vanilla WoW (which change throughout its lifecycle), and apply it to the framework that Blizzard is working with. 
---
Which means they should create a game that has never existed before, not restore the game we all love as faithfully as possible within reason, **warts and all**.
---
People don't realize that early vanilla, before the the class revamps, was absolute ass.
---
I say this as an UD rogue who had it really good early vanilla
---
We need to take the best parts of vanilla and throw out the mistakes.
---
It would be nice if more specs were viable for raiding, for example. Because if Blizz *could* have made all specs somewhat viable, they would have. Just bring some of them in line, they can still be last, just don't let them remain nonexistant
---
I'm from Arkansas, which is 100% Hillsbrad foothills irl.
---
No one has to roll hunter to compete for gold. I don't play alts, and I never played hunter in vanilla, yet I never had gold issues. If you play to the strengths of your class and you're not lazy, anyone can make good profit. 
---
Are you going to have as much as a hunter who spends hours in DM: T every day? No, but it's not going to make or break my personal game experience or ability to afford other items. The idea that a class specific farming method will over-inflate  the market is far-fetched.
---
100% Classic community BTFO. Now be sure to buy your annual season pass and red dot sight for CoD like a good boy.
---
alright tyvm!
---
That is not the point. You have to look what all other games do in the Period you are holding the stock. Activision is just huge and if they invest in something that is not worth it (lets say the next COD is SP only) you will lose even when WoW classic gets 150% more players then retail (will never happen)
---
Keep claiming you can do it!
---
wrong
---
I don't know what you mean paladins have less options for farming, if anything they have more since they're great at aoe farming. In wpvp they about as good as druids for fighting but not as good at running away(besides bubble+hs) and blow druids out of the water in groups. Paladins are one of the least group reliant classes in the game so i have no idea where you got the idea that they are from.
---
Both are fine. Salv is really nice and I'd say overall alliance have an edge with paladins, but shamans have a lot of utility. What a paladin can do defensively, a shaman can do offensively as a counter. They hit really hard, can purge seals right off a paladin and interrupt making them almost useless outside of that 12 second bubble. It's not as bad as you think. I'm playing alliance this time around to. and I still say that.
---
Thou shalt not solicit stock advice from the internet - bad idea.
---
Here’s an idea, how about the Mods of this sun refit choose a pvp realm and say it’s the PVP-RP realm and everyone who wants it chooses that realm?
---
And since a billion different classes want truestrike you definitely want the second best option since you're only getting truestrike if you're lucky or you run UBRS a lot.
---
i pray you are right!
---
Awesome!
---
Sure, if you are going for the long term play. I still think you will see a decent bump after classic comes out.
---
This video was when I realized how big wow was. The person who told me about it did not even play wow
---
Highlight the part where they say items are going to be in &lt;1.12 state, it only talks about 1.12 drop locations and rates, not state.
---
Well you literally just said that no changes means "some changes"?
---
Honestly curious about what you think on this. Classes that got rebalanced prior to major raid tiers, should those changes happen, or no?
---
Successful outcomes are too reliant on RNGs.
---
People first ask hunter if it's a big upgrade for him and then roll an item. The only cases when this happening is when certain item piece is bis for both of these classes and yeah, "main role" classes would be pissed about hunter rolling need on Dal'Rend, but he needs it just for stats or warriors/rogues needing crossbow from blackrock spire.
---
Sorry but frost mages can farm any open world spot with mass pull. So if you the AH is healthy Mages beats everything. 
---
Also the the Dungeon farm like tribute are hard for new players and are rng. Farming humanoids always give you the cloth and just need you to run circles and cast blizzard, frost nova.
---
Not good in raids, solo PvP amazing, group PvP very good. Ranged are actually hard counters if they get outside of your channeled range, and I would say shaman absolutely.  Still, you always have a chance and you hit REALLY hard. Remember, you have extra armor with shadow form plus armor talents from disc, silence, and a short fear CD. They also farm VERY well.
---
You WILL drink A LOT and chug a lot of mana pots. Make friends with mages.
---
43 responses. Nice data

Not really looking for advice per say, more just opinions or something that i may have missed :)

Cheating a bit here as i know what im playing. I will be maining a priest (undead) and levelling with my friend who is making a warrior. For times where he isn't online and i am (he has kids so is only on post 8pm) I am rolling a warlock, and im aware based on time played that my warlock could become my main, in the sense that i may leapfrog my priest in level.
---
My question is about professions, i want to take tailoring and enchanting on the warlock so i can make my pre raid BiS for the priest and other reasons. My priest is going to be herb/alch so it can make its own consumables. Do you all think these professions make sense? Are they viable forms of making decent gold? I played vanilla but was a complete noob and had no idea what was going on so never bothered with professions and only got to the early 40s.
---
i really dont because i think Classic is getting max 1 mio Players that are not subbed. Most of them will not stay longer then the first 2 months.
---
Hope i will be wrong but thats what i think
---
Anyone can play the AH and open world aoe farming isn’t always reliable due to competition, especially on PvP realms. And even that doesn’t beat hunters and walrlocks that can do instanced Mara farming or rogues that can pickpocket BRD.
---
Sorry
---
what are you talking about?! I was ganked in STV from lvl 7 to 25, but now I found a really good healer and together we overcome every obstacle. soon we might invite a lowbie as well to our garrison
---
pvp protection till you are level 18 or flagged if you are flagged you can pvp with everyone at every level, but you can become hated by the server...
---
Selfmade or repost?
---
Actually yes and for exactly this reason. I don’t think traders take into account the streaming factor very well - many larger streamers have announced that they will be streaming classic.
---
Not that very wrong - raided a lot in vanilla, not in any super competitive high end guilds, but cleared first couple of bosses in AQ40 and rarely anyone used anything.... People here are exaggerating way too much with the raiding requirements. Sure it is nice to have, but it's nowhere near to being mandatory.
---
Naw, not a massive change. The only difference is the names of the players. You can still group up with your faction and you are still only competing again your own faction to rank 14. 
---
You cannot comment on server numbers, because that haven’t been released yet.
---
If you made this, bravo good sir. Highest quality of memes right here
---
Can someone explain to me what being a "meme" is? I must be getting old. Is it a reference to memes?
---
I remember getting lost in WC one time in Vanilla, we kept running in circles on the right side of the instance and couldn't figure out where to go.
---
Tbh I get your point and it’s not really possible to disagree. I think they solve it by stating that this was never the intention to begin with and probably have him deaggro if you run up the walls. 
---
Hunters getting 100g+/hour reliably without competition means they can reliably buy every black lotus, every edgemasters or any other patterns they desire. 
---
One single person can p much trash an economy by farming anywhere from 500-1000g per day if they wish/have the time. Imagine once the tactic (that didn’t exist in vanilla, at least there’s no proof of it) becomes main stream.
---
You are not in the minority actually. We who do competetive PvP at the highest level are. I want my char to look good too but I have to go tauren druid instead of nelf because of how easily I can get f\*cked by a orc rogue or warrior because of simple rng. It would suck to outplay someone but lose because of a resisted grenade or bash. I have no choice to go tauren if my goal is to be at the highest level in 1v1 situations.
---
He'll be fine if he doesn't want to do PVP. If he reaches lvl 60 when hardcore are farming BWL that's going to be painful.
---
I love it!
---
Those chewed up ankles when running with a robe tho. Ugh.
---
It's not releasing on a Friday. They always release stuff on Tuesday's so you'll have to stick to Tuesday's for any guesses.
---
I can see that, unless it goes the other way and becomes an online phenomena again lol

===========================================
---
THE WALL OF NO - REVISED AS OF JUNE 18, 2015
---
SUMMARY:
---
1. Blizzard does not believe there are enough people interested in utilizing this idea long term to justify the costs necessary to bring it about.
---
2. Blizzard feels this idea is counter to the nature of MMO’s; non-progression equates to stagnation and eventual boredom.
---
3. Blizzard does not possess the old code. No, they did not save it as a "backup" - they might have for the launch of Cataclysm, but that was over four years and two expansions ago. Even if it were “recoverable” by other means (i.e., see “private” servers” below) it would still require lengthy and expensive rewrite, a task Blizzard denies interest in.
---
4. They have no plans or desire to recreate the original version(s). They refer to the notion as “a logistical nightmare,”… and in keeping with #1 above the time, money and resources required are prohibitive and unjustified.
---
TL;DR: “Too much cost, too little interest and it’s not what the game is about… we’re not doing it.”
---
Proponents of “Classic” (or any other variant thereof) servers rarely put thought into the idea. This would be similar to requests for the film industry to make silent films again, or the auto industry to mass-produce Model-T cars again. Avid collectors, people who look fondly back on those days, or new folks curious about the past might take a look at them, but that wouldn't be a high number of people in the first place - never mind the few of those who would actually pay for the experience. There’s not enough market for those, so those companies are not doing it; neither is Blizzard. That doesn't mean there isn't a market - just that it's nowhere near large enough to make it worthwhile.
---
...
---
really nice
---
Boy... are you retarded?
---
Blizzard: “ We will be using patch 1.12.1 as out foundation because **WE** believe it provides the best vanilla experience.”
---
Also blizzard: “ We only have the data for 1.12.1.”
---
Where the fuck does that say the community chose that?
---
The rest of your post is pointless drivel.
---
Can’t wait for the Antarctica expansion
---
I want at least 1 server that is RP-PVP. Please Blizzard.
---
DM east was severely nerfed in classic. Most private servers run with old xp and loot tables. They did this for the exact reason people want tribute runs disabled: 100g+ per hour farms without competition ruins server economies. From the DM:E farm went mainstream it took them a week or so to fix it.
---
yesssss i cant wait!
---
You have to buy the expansion pack
---
After long thinking I got myself to choosing the Alliance! So I got this settled down.
---
For classes I am can't decide if I want to go for a Human Warlock,  or dwarf Healbot Paladin. I don't like gnomes, and if possible i wanna play a dwarf. Everybody says how much better horde warlocks are, are alliance really that bad?
---
Main Goal: I want to level in the first Month to 60, do dungeons and go in a casual 1-2 raid night raiding guild. 
---
2nd Goal: I want to have the full blue pvp set (if its doable in reasonable time).
---
3rd Goal: Almost sure that I will take Herb and Skinning for leveling, looking up a Data sheet what i need for Alchemy from 1-300 and saving these flowers and selling the rest.
---
Question 1: How bad is a alliance warlock in PvP
---
Question 2: Am I able to take care of myself just of professions with these 2 classes?
---
Question 3: Against how many people will I fight for loot
---
Question 4: How are my chances of finding a good guild
---
Oh sorry, a bit late. I just got a bit triggered and offended by your post and needed a safespace. But it's all gyyyyyyyd now.
---
That's in LBRS right? That boss is soloable?
---
I would rather not push you off.
---
Its hilarious because once you know the route, its so simple. But until you learn it, it can suck. Not to mention the lack of dungeon maps in Classic lol
---
I was fishing a lot at the beginning of Vanilla but when schools appeared I didn't fish much so I don't remember if it's still worth fishing outside of schools.
---
Except it's not a fix. The naming policy won't be in place. Furthermore original PvPers and RP-PvPers will inevitably clash. RPers face a lot of backlash on PvP realms, unfortunately.
---
Did Africa shrink?
---
Then you would have been in the minority.  At least on my server.  I'm just telling you what my experience was.  I'm not sure how that can be wrong.
---
That's only good when it's pvp, not in pve you big goof!
---
I only actively trade &lt;5% of my savings. That being said I have had good success buying stocks of products I own and buy (Apple, Amazon, etc...) I usually own Activision/Blizzard (ATVI) when I am subbed to WOW and sell when I unsub. It has served me well as I bought ATVi back when it was &lt;$40 and sold when I un-subbed last year at \~$75. I did just buy ATVi yesterday unfortunately taking a 2% hit today. I am buying for the classic bump when the release date is communicated.   
---
The other bump ATVI may get from Blizzard product is from the WC3 reforged that will come in 4Qtr this year.
---
Mc, bout 20-25min
---
Ony, like 10 hours
---
Why would you farm in a group? Between lockpicking and stealth you could get to the bar and solo farm the shanker. That's how I got mine. Otherwise I put an inordinate amount of time farming essence of air for agility weapon enchants.
---
Yeah for sure. From the research I've done druids can do solo DMT with engineering, but it just takes longer than a hunter would. But fair enough, paladins are definitely better in terms of AOE farming and the like. 
---
I do agree though, wearing cloth as a paladin is a huge buzzkill. That gets rectified in part by Naxx, but that is a loooong ways off. 
---
I'm also very hesitant about the paladin leveling experience. If I'm going ham in the first week of launch, there is only so much auto attacking while watching Netflix that one man can handle.
---
Regardless, I appreciate the insight. I will definitely consider it.
---
I love rezzing in a BG , budding myself with fort, spirit, and shadow prot and then having to drink. It’s pretty much awesome!!!1
---
your logic = "my commodore 64 isn't obsolete, because its better than a slide-rule"
---
It's effective but like op said not reliable at all if you're on a PvP server. For example, you gonna pull the skeletons in wpl you better hope a rogue or druid don't jump your a\*s mid pull. Hell, even a leveler can see you while you're pulling and come kill you, not that hard when you have 15 mobs on you.
---
Hence "within reason". You're still deeply misunderstanding what "nochanges" means. It means no changes (yes, we get it, some changes) from the final version of the client, *within reason*. It doesn't mean "don't update balance from patch to patch" because we already know that balance will be based off the 1.12 values. It means "we want the game as it was at the end of Vanilla, with *as few changes as possible*". This includes staggered content releases because otherwise the game wouldn't work properly. No, Blizzard is not going to rebalance classes from phase to phase, nor should they. Just like they're not going to re-introduce every bug and fix it patch-to-patch.
---
 [https://www.method.gg/raid-history](https://www.method.gg/raid-history)
---
Patch day no play, no changes :o
---
Lol you don't understand how BiS and upgrades work in Vanilla do you?
---
Wow you got to level to 18 without major payments? Lucky you! 
---
Most players have to start farming mats at lower levels just to afford repairs.
---
Yes! forgot about reforged as well. I am also waiting on the release date before i get into ATVI to heavily.
---
I'm not an expert at all so i'm not sure if the stock price has gone down because of Blizzard having a tough time lately, or if it's something else entirely. But i'm sure classic is going to be successful. They will also release DI pretty soon and will likely announce D4 this year, so i think their stock is gonna start rising after that.
---
Was main tank Orc Warrior (up to BWL) in Classic and loved being a tank. I played a belf pally in TBC and loved it also, and figured out that I’m a pretty decent healer in PvP and PVE.
---
I realistically don’t have time be a main tank, nor can play a pally again because I am rolling horde. I’d like to play a support role that’ll be able to be decent in PvP and be useful for raids when I have time to play. I’m leaning towards an Undead/Troll Priest or Orc Shaman...or just saying f’ it and rolling a warrior to be an off-tank.
---
Quilboar = Emu?
---
The chain for Onyxia was quite long, and honestly one of the more enjoyable quest chains in Vanilla for building up the lore for a boss.   
---
MC can by done in less than half an hour, particularly if you get in a group that does a lava jump run specifically to get it out of the way.
---
actually forsaken are really good for pvp
---
Smooth guild plug
---
We? Do you work for Blizzard? 
---
Again, like OP, what you're describing is a game that never existed. That's not what the community has been asking for for 13 years or so.
---
Fun yes, first no.
---
Picked Tauren for cinematic but mistook him for a warrior.
---
That guy was made for tanking twin emperors
---
ok so one class with one spec can , that doesnt change my point at all
---
Sorry if that came off as a bit snarky, but yeah I didn’t really get into fishing until after they started with the schools.  I plan on spending a lot of time fishing with my friends, as a lot of people didn’t want to sink the time into this process and demand was always high on my old server. A lot of the better places to fish were contested areas, so it’s good to go in groups.
---
Some of it comes from people just not liking certain streamers or their fanbases, others dislike it as the server's events will likely rotate around that streamer if enough of their fanbase is on it. An example would be Asmon being likely to be the one to ring the scarab gong without much effort on his part by getting his viewers to help him out.
---
Start leveling my alt.
---
Note: Mages can NOT farm BRD. It's confirmed by footage back then that there are 3 mobs that will hinder you from doing this farm.
---
proof?
---
Streamers on vanilla servers might get sniped alot,  know i would find it hillarious. But  advertising against i dont know what that would be aimed towards
---
It's not bad, makes the game pretty social. It forces you to group up and adapt. 
---
Speaking from pservers launch experiences.
---
Boooooooore
---
Delayed. But that wont happend, Blizzard keep their deadlines.
---
Casting animations and what they look like in Tier gear. Warrior tier gear is sexy...
---
After seeing what Barrens chat is like on p servers now I'm interested to see what it will be like in Classic.
---
MC is extremely easy and only requires you to do an Emperor run of BRD.
---
Ony can take several hours, and the horde version often takes even longer than the ally one due to requiring a lot more travel and more dungeon runs.
---
True, you auto attack and judge. It’s really not a lot worse than priest where you bubble, mind blast, dot, and wand a billion times though. At least you are pretty damn durable and avoid more corpse runs than most. Bubble and LoH plus a free mount. Maybe if you want to challenge yourself, level engineering while you go to make it more interesting
---
I'm certainly avoiding big streamers like asmongold or soda because they have a bigger fanbase, but I heard tipsout/esfand/staysafe are going to roll on the same PvP server. One of them is going horde and the other two alliance, wouldnt it be a good balance?
---
Also, Blizzard will probably nerf big gold incomes involving solo dungeon farming.

was looking at getting something like this:-

Should be fine for casual playing (while still pretending to the wife that I'm listening to her)...haha
---
If that's true... and this post hasn't been removed... Equip your tinfoil hat! We're getting a release date today!
---
https://youtu.be/6NPg20GdNxk
---
I’m with you OP. I have a feeling today is the day.
---
June 28th, 2019. Calling it!
---
I genuinely believe it could surpass retail with time. Granted its an old game now, but it's an old game that set an entire genre and nothing has really taken its place since. Retail is a different animal aimed towards a more casual playerbase.
---
Why would they do that if they want to keep it as authentic as possible?
---
Raiding as Alliance is almost easy-mode compared to horde. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but paladins are insane for PvE with threat reduction. The other blessings and heal efficiency is just a cherry on top. Shamans bring lots of utility with totems (namely windfury), but buffs aren't a huge deal when you have to slow down DPS because tank needs to catch up on threat.
---
For PvP however, orcs and forsaken are definitely the best. Dwarfs (and possibly gnome if you are playing melee) are amazing too, but racials that eliminate CC altogether are VERY strong.
---
With that being said, play what faction you feel the most ties to. Having an identity and pride for your faction are much more important than min/max'ing your experience. If you can't do well in PvE or PvP because of your faction, then there is much larger problems to be fixed.
---
Buggy. Most people wouldn't resist playing and would spend their whole time complaining about how bad it was while still being unable to look away.

MC wasnt long at all.

Ony was a long quest chain. It was worth doing at like lvl 57 (back in vanilla), as you got plenty of xp for it too.

More like Alta-Supreme

I levelled from 48-60 doing a BRD farm. They can farm the arena spectators endlessly and it’s v. Good cash.
---
There is no such thing as gear piece not for your class, its either an upgrade or not an upgrade, and its not up to the group to tell you whether you need it enough to be allowed to roll on it.
---
actually the best place is Stockades.  But for horde Deadmines is more accessible.
---
I Love It!
---
If you're tanking 5-mans as Fury early, or swap to Fury Tank later on in the game once you're geared, you can farm DME 2 man for really good gp/hr with a healer. Selling fast Lava runs/any other dungeon runs are also good.
---
If you're a prot paladin AoE grinding is insane and there are some 5-mans you can solo for cash too. Bear Druid not sure about.

My logic is that PvP gear (for a lot of classes some items are actually BIS until Naxx) is worth it if you like PvP and have the time to farm it.
---
It's in no way at all obsolete. And your logic isn't how I think, that's how you think.

"Ryzen 5 1700x is now obsolete because another Rysen have been released, even if 1700x would blow every game away"
---
&gt; Right now I finally think I've settled on playing a warrior. Change my mind.
---
I mean, since you decided already to play warrior already, go for it, but your description of what you want to can also be applied to druid.
---
&gt; Not struggle to find groups while leveling and/or at 60
---
Since druid can perform all 3 roles, they'll have no problem finding groups.

I don't know about killing machine, for me at least druids are more fun pvp wise. Plus they are incredible versatile.
---
&gt; Do OK in world pvp
---
Druids can do that.
---
I am lvl 27 and still dont have any talents...
---
No, they won't. The backlash will be incredible. They're not spending all this time harvesting good will to throw it all away later, they need people to stay subscribed.
---
MC 30 mins
---
Ony fucking ages
---
That’s when we go on a manhunt for OP
---
&gt; You cannot comment on server numbers, because that haven’t been released yet.
---
You can make assumptions, however. Blizz specifically said "lean" servers, meaning fewer servers. So one could assume that populations for each server would possibly be higher than not, to ensure a good player base later down the line. [I mean, here's the tweet.](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1109832561704878081)
---
You can also interpret this as evidence that they wouldn't have crbgs in from start (because they weren't), but add them in when they are needed. It sorta dismantles the whole argument going on in here by op and a bunch of people that shares his view on the situation.
---
t0 Hunter chest. Ubrs last boss. Was so annyoing to find a pug group of 15 man which wanted to go. If you went there was absolutly no guarantee to actually succeed in the dungeon. Then almost nobody that wanted to go had a key.
---
Killed the boss around 50 times I would guess and never saw it drop.
---
Also the winterspring saber which I got as soon as i heard about it. As a Hunter you could have the same tiger as a pet. So when you were mounted you would have the same tiger you are sitting on running next to you. I was so happy when I finally achieved this. Than not shortly after they released a patch where hunter pets would disappear as soon as you mount. I was so angry.
---
So first we were going to have a discussion on what the "spirit" of vanilla was.
---
Now we're going to use patch notes to somehow extrapolate the vision of original devs? 
---
Do you really think you'll ever get people to agree on any of that?
---
Even if we were to bring the original devs back, I'm willing to bet you'd get a lot different answers from each of them, assuming they even remember what they were doing 15 years ago.
---
What you're asking is going to piss off a lot people no matter how you spin it.
---
And as AVWoW said, this project is not about creating a game that could have been, it's about recreating a game that was, or atleast as close to it as we can.
---
Given a slot in a premade pvp even if they are shit
---
Gifted items
---
And a flood of people following them
---
Lava run of brd. Do not need lyceum or emperor.
---
Did you do this back in 2005? Or did you do this on a private server.
---
If you're into self-torture that is. It's not chaotic FFA PvP, it's dedicated guild group of 5 60s methodically circling the lvl 50+ zones and killing every quester of the opposing faction repeatedly.
---
it was a one day thing, honor is for forever
---
I will give platinum.
---
[deleted]
---
You honestly think it was Blizzard's intention for only one spec to be viable for raiding?
---
Do you really think arbitrarily having less choice in playstyle makes for a better game?
---
&gt; what you're describing is a game that never existed. That's not what the community has been asking for for 13 years or so.
---
So you think we should be playing without the class revamps as well? They constitute a *massive* change in how the classes play. So you're OK with that, but much more minor changes are bad because...?
---
Yeah did not say they are the best but they are easy and on a pve server no problem
---
I think that room is the reason people ask for 20+. Though I think those people are wieners :)
---
Why not play a Druid, heal raids and be able to tank 5 men? Seems to suit your lack of time to be a mains tank well enough.
---
Shadow Priest, Hunter, Mage, Druid
---
No way they will ever surpass retail. Retail gets new content and will always be more relevant alone for pve and even pvp with the arena championships.
---
Dwarf Paladin. You won't kill them, but you won't die :^)
---
This is more or less true. Of course you need to get fire resistant up, but the first 3 bosses (if I remember correctly) are fairly easy. MC was put together at the last minute due to players leveling 1-60 way too fast, so it’s pretty easy to figure out.
---
Dual spec is the only option I would like to be added. I know its not happening so im not asking for it but I would personally really love it since I want to be a shadow priest but also like to heal (and will be most likely forced to)
---
Compared to how much could MAX you could farm an hour, spending the 30 minutes to log into someone’s account, vendor there shit and receive like 80+ gold is a whole lot better. 
---
Side note: I learned about how they used to hack accounts back in the day. The hackers would receive your account info for a WoW fan site then they would just randomly try credentials on a WoW client until that logged them in.
---
So here’s one example, AQ patch should they increase pally blessings to 15 mins? I would argue yes.
---
Is that not recreating the game to as close as it was?
---
Yeah get that. Just wanted to point out that they are easy for farming and on a pve realm a no brainer
---
If you’re doing a lava jump run you’re generally going straight to emp.
---
Yes the run does not require you to kill Emp but you usually don’t run BRD just to get attuned and then immediately leave.
---
It was a problem on every version of Vanilla I played prior to crbgs and it's still a problem on private servers right now, even crazy-high pop ones like I'm currently on. I can do a /who gulch/basin and most of the time out of 7000+ horde online, nobody is playing in any bracket. 
---
#nochanges does not mean starting with a flawed product and rolling out every patch change from 1.01 until 1.12. Most people I've seen complaining about crbgs don't ever want to see them in Classic, not because they don't feel they'll be needed immediately, but because they want their tight little exclusive PVP community back.
---
Dude that is a monster of a laptop ;) you could easily play retail with it
---
That would be a great server to roll horde on. So many fun world encounters.
---
Well, in vanilla people want shaman on every party, so they'll bring 8 in a 40-man raid.
---
They'd never bring 8 druids unless they are really lacking people/healers.
---
I’m not into reading between the lines of a tweet., even if I did you’d tell me I’m totally wrong and it’s the worst thing in the world. 
---
You are not gonna convince me and others in here otherwise and vice versa , so we’ll see.
---
I have give thought to this. If I played a Druid I probably would heal over tanking, but now you just made my decision even harder lol.
---
IIRC, weren't there battle-groups though?
---
Like, a handful of servers were grouped together and you could still get to know people, and it wasn't a "every server cross-realm" deal.
---
What i dont remember is if it was only for low-pop or not.
---
As a Feral Druid, Mark of Tyranny vs Blackhand's Breadth. Mark of Tyranny is just the best tanking trinket you can get by a longshot forever. Blackhands breadth though is also effectively BiS unless you can actually expect to get a KotS and DFT. Mark of Tyranny is probably the right choice since i would say your DPS isnt as important
---
Was it in 1.12?
---
Then yes, they should be 15 min long
---
If I can remember correctly, having multiple RP and RPPVP realms left some of them dead, I think it would be a good road to add 1 RP and 1 RPPVP realm for each region at launch, so there will be a long term healthy population.
---
Broken tooth was brilliant for PVP on casters as the attack speed was so quick. 
---
My favourite pets in vanilla was King Bangalash. He was hard to tame and seemed to do a lot of damage. Same with Humar the pride lord, I camped out for days to get him.
---
Little do you know, among other things, it’s really only one on the latter.
---
So angry!
---
I think many people who played vanilla are having a harder time picking a class now because we know so much more and can evaluate the classes with a better expectation for the game experience. 
---
Just a note that priest leveling is pretty efficient, so it isn't that unpleasant to get to 60.
---
1. Probably better actually. Fighting undeads with wotf are much less annoying than playing group pvp against paladins.
---
2. Herb and skinning are good money makers but if you want pvp on the paladin engineering helps a lot to cover your weaknesses.
---
3. It's about the same number of people for every class since most healers and casters go for the same gear with warlocks being a little bit easier to gear due to generally slightly smaller warlock population and shadow damage exclusive gear.
---
4. Finding a guild and getting into raids is not really a problem for any class, don't worry about it.
---
You’re right, consumables we’re not that big of a deal and my guild went 11/15 naxx40. Some fights on specific attempts sure...
---
That’s epic
---
Lol okay. Just to clarify, this video is about the release of the 4 world boss dragons. It was one Alliance guild fighting one Horde guild to see who got to kill the Dragon boss. They were there for the epics, not the honor. Seemed like the person I was responding to didn't get that.
---
What else can clothies do for professions? Maybe mining and engeneering. Can't really do blacksmith or leather working.
---
If you want gold avoid engeneering. Herb alch is good for gold. Enchanting is good later but sucks a lot of gold early.
---
You can grab the onyxia chain at 48 I believe although it's not really possible to do it yet. Most people try to get it at least started before 60.
---
I think, back in the day, I started it at 55 so by the time I was 60 I was already passed the BRD parts.
---
You've made some incredible leaps in logic and assumption here. Nice work.
---
A lot of these comments sound like private server players.  If this is the case, I don’t believe their words will hold much weight in this thread.
---
1. Classic will launch in 1.12.1 state. This means everything from talents, itemization, bug fixes, debuff limits, etc will make the earlier content easier.  
---
2. Private servers make things harder to be more of a challenge. 
---
3. Private servers don’t do everything as it was the way in vanilla. Example: Onyxia buff could only happen when no other head has bee turned in for a while, when no head on the spike/chains in the major city. So worlds buffs aren’t that big of an issue.
---
4. Gearing will be even less of a concern due to the changes listed in 1. It will still be valuable for tanks so they don’t get shit on by bosses, of course.  Resist gear is a concern mainly for tanks.
---
5. Consumables aren’t going to be that big of a deal in the early stages because of 1. **Even less so for tanks.** Any competent guild will know tanks have an even harder time farming and should provide the necessary resources, at least some minimum.
---
6. There will be plenty of guilds on all the servers. Find one that fits your play-style and play time.
---
cheers, been a wee while since I had time for gaming, so want it to last a few ;)
---
I mean, wouldn’t being buggy as shit bring back that nostalgia?  #nochanges
---
Sure buddy
---
Druid. They can't kill you if they can't find you. Also bear form is amazingly powerful vs rogues. Root them and go heal. Backto bear and wear them down. With fairie fire they can't stealth.
---
Ah, so you don't disagree with the idea of the principle. You disagree with the principle itself. #nochanges is inconvenient for someone who feels that 
---
&gt;simple changes should be added to the classic WoW servers.
---
Blessings were 5 minutes in 1.12. They got changed to 15 minutes AQ patch. I remember being really happy about this as an hpal.
---
This is the stuff I’m talking about when I say that no changes doesn’t really make sense. If we are trying to recreate the game as close as possible to what is WAS, we should be including these changes that occurred throughout vanilla WOWs life cycle. Picking out what worked and leaving out what was garbage. That is where the discussion should be .
---
I secretly hope it gets delayed until like October. Then I can spend summer outside and winter inside leveling.
---
Saving this post because the comments are great.
---
How interesting please go on were listennzzZZZzZzZ
---
What about the 60 Billion creatures killed in PVE every year?
---
Agreed, we  don't want more than 1 really :)
---
You can't be revered or even honred at lvl 21 in Vanilla. You either played in TBC or on a private server.
---
Dwarf females should have beards
---
Not really
---
I think you know what vers is. You seem the type. \*wink\*
---
Always regretted being a gnome dont do it
---
I disagree with using the phrase “no changes” to describe “no changes to Vanilla wow except for small changes that make sense and don’t fundamentally change the game”
---
Personally I won't mind seeing it down the line. It was released after naxx, so basically the final phase - I totally wouldn't mind getting Xrealm in the final phase, but I really don't want to see it in when BGs first go live. That would suck big time.
---
I would switch the professions around or atleast take tailoring on the priest. The epic robe is BoP on craft and the warlock one isn't that great while the priest one is awesome.
---
How i'll feel when it releases.

---
Everyone realizes that it's impossible to completely and totally recreate every change and every patch that happened through the entire course of vanilla. We are all aware that certain things will be different similar to the example you gave with talent trees. There were certainly many changes that lead up to 1.12 where their original forms are going to be discarded and forgotten.
---
That isn't what #NoChanges is about. #NoChanges is a simple way for everyone to convey the idea that Blizzard should implement additional elements into the game that did not already exist in classic. *(sharding / cash shop / paid name change / race change / faction changes / raid finder / ect)* 
---
It has nothing to do with how Blizzard is planning to structure all of the elements that were part of classic together.
---
I didnt realise it was BoP! Thanks for the tip :)
---
What’s worse is both cause it needs to come out NOW
---
You literally just said that “we already know that simple changes which do not fundamentally impact the game are being include”
---
Just as a note, Berserking takes a global, so you usually lose as much casting time as you gain. Its only really worth it when youre doing a fight where you have to reposition at some point, its a VERY minor benefit.
---
Yes, you're the only one.
---
Naw triggered mad kid, just you.
---
All options are pretty viable, if you're off tanking on your warrior you can do casual PvP and PvE too. Im no PvP expert but you can PvP in PvE talents as a healer, its not ideal, but it saves you a tonne not having to respec every time.
---
There we have it. It explicitly says in the tweet "But our priority is **making sure servers have long-term healthy populations**, **so we'll start with lean realmlists and expand as needed**, just as the 2004 launch did"
---
Not much reading between the lines there. That's what is said.
---
The tweet is pretty solid evidence that blizz isn't about having things in game at earlier points than was the case in vanilla. When they don't want to have an RP-PvP server in from the start because they weren't in the game originally from the start, then it's pretty easy to conclude that CRBGs won't be in classic from the start, only at a later date if needed.
---
Where I’m saying the phrase is bad is because of how easy it is for people to use it to critique ANY change to 1.12 
---
EX: “hey man 15 minute blessings were added in AQ maybe we should consider that?” -“NO CHANGES!”
---
Such a hard choice! I think I'll go female Nelf or male Dwarf. But all my names are usually male varients so it'll be tough to figure out a new one that all my friends know me by
---
I HOPE we're right but I still struggle to see blizz make such a huge announcement and let it interfere with the 8.2 hype like that. Feel like theyre gonna be more carefully calculated with that shit.
---
PvP balance at high gear levels is a shitshow in general. If it does ever get to a point where Naxx gear is the norm, everyone's just going to be 3-shotting each other regardless of class. I wouldn't base your decisions on that too much. I think players will come and go, casuals will still play, and probably full Naxx gear will still be rare after 3-4 years because few people are willing to put the effort into a difficult raid like that.
---
Warlocks aren't as squishy or as dot-reliant as you're thinking IMO. They still have high HP as non-SL, and nothing's stopping SL locks from using shadowbolt/searing pain/drain life for damage. Casters will still hate their life with Curse of Tongues, drain mana, etc. There will be a lot of scenarios where a dispeller isn't there anyway. SL/SL locks were OP in TBC arena, despite having zero dispel protection and a dispeller focusing on them in almost every match.
---
I did not.
---
If you're a rogue or a druid ... You can do it just to get attuned them immediately leave. Especially if the jumping bug exists still where if you jump at the right moment in the lava you take 0 dmg from it.
---
I own $8,000 worth right now, 177 shares. 
---
Average price at $44.70, so right around my break even price. Im very bullish on May second
---
Blizzard - you've done a great job listening to us and our concerns.  I feel this is one more area that you can oblige us on.  Give these people their home - one per region to start.  
---
While I am no RPer, I would be devastated to see you remove PvP realms, forcing me to play with the carebears.  :)
---
Hook these people up.
---
During the demo it was not a thing.
---
It has been confirmed to not exist in classic.
---
That makes two of us, though I'm not sure if that's thread worthy since almost nobody who says #no changes would campaign for small changes. Perhaps you misunderstand what it means. No changes means that you encourage Blizzard to *only* include things that were in the original 2004-2006 experience.
---
The question is one for you, then. What’s “viable”? 
---
You can definitely roll a toon and level playing 3-6 hours per week. It’ll take a while to get to 60, but it’s totally do-able. 
---
It’s unlikely that you’ll be able to raid on that schedule and you definitely won’t be getting Marshall again. You can still do dungeons and bgs though. 
---
If playing at a truly casual pace will be fulfilling for you, then nothing in the game itself will hold you back.
---
nice average! hoping they can get you some money, i dont see the price going down much more.
---
It fully depends on you and what you want to experience. Playing on a streamer server can be fun but it can also be hell because the entire server will revolve around the streamer and what he's doing. Naturally occurring events will happen less and the events you will see/hear about will be pre-planned streamer events which can ruin the vanilla experience for some.
---
Also, when it comes to big streamers like Sodapoppin.. he's big enough to simply overpopulate an entire server by himself and the worst part with that is that 95% of the people will roll the same faction as him so they can follow him around which creates a massive imbalance.
---
But again, it's all up to you. I'm EU so I don't have to think about this.
---
Ok, so 2/9 classes can run in and grab it, i was speaking in a general sense with my first post, yes you can just go in solo it’s stealth and grab it if your class can stealth I suppose, but it’s mostly going to be done in groups.
---
So I googled what "plug" means and it's pretty spot on sir!
---
&gt;Plug  
---
A person who has everything u need
---
&gt;Is it weird that people want the best items in a game? How is this different from any other game?
---
It's not weird to want it. It's just that in my experience that goal is unattainable.

Tweet about rppvp and server population = no xbgs till later. Huge guess.
---
I agree with Kazzier, a lot of people will move from retail to classic and a lot of people who don't play will go back to classic. Take a look at Runescape, almost the exact same thing happened and there "classic" version is more popular by far.
---
Honestly if you actually like gnomes, and like PvP, escape artist is amazing because it helps with warriors' biggest weakness - getting kited. I'd totally go gnome if I were you. I just couldn't bring myself to roll a gnome for appearance's sake.
---
Today I saw a peacock standing by the side of the road.  I will take it as a sign.
---
The problem is a bit more complex in Vanilla as the smaller raids in Vanilla are nearly as large as the large raids in TBC. 40man politics are not exactly easy to manage and appear fair. Also vanilla loot is alot more murky than TBC itemization. I'm not saying what you propose is bad, but just to keep in mind attempting to loot council for a 40 man is nearly impossible to seem fair. There is a MT and a prime OT but you will still need to gear several other OT and when you get to Naxx you have to gear a ton more tanks for a few fights.
---
Yeah, that does sound like a fun server to play on! They don't have *huge* fanbases like Asmon and stuff like you mentioned, but enough that the server will be active and you'll probably have lots of fun stuff going on there.
---
I tried a Hunter, and since I was playing Alliance, of course I had to make a Dwarf and level with a Bear pet.
---
It ended up being my main that I raided on for several years after that.
---
When people talk about Alliance warlocks being bad they are talking about 1v1 scenarios or PvP. Orcs have less stun duration and undead have will of the unforsaken, while humans have stealth detection and dwarfs have a way to drop bleeds and poisons. In PvE it doesn't matter what race you pick.
---
Gold is way harder to earn in vanilla, like WAY harder. So getting two gathering professions will help.
---
If you're in a good guild they'll probably use DKP and you'll get loot based on how much you put in, if you're in a shit guild they will use loot council and you'll rarely get anything while you watch all the loot go to the "core" raiders.
---
Depends on your availability and skill and also how they plan to do classic, back then pretty much everyone knew about each other and you played with the same people a lot. It made it easy to get into a already established guild by word of mouth.
---
Let me summarize the alliance Ony attunement, "WTF Talked to marshal??"
---
I went Tauren Shaman because of the 2h Totem swinging attack against the Dwarf hunters pet bear. I got so sad when I realized that there were no weapons like that in the game..
---
Right, I'm not about not ever having crbgs no matter what, only not at the start because it's not the vanilla experience.

If you are on Ndale, the reason no one is queueing is because most pvp oriented people quit in between the honor system and bg patch, and now it's basically a pve server. Then more people quit, and with every day we get closer to classic, so the incentive to play on a pserver is less and less rewarding, other than route practice. If you want pserver bgs, you need to play on hen house, that's where all the rankers/pvpers are currently playing. A huge portion of people that would typically be queuing on ndale, aren't because hen house is where the action is at until classic.
---
On nost, we had queues less than 5mins, horde had higher queue times, sometimes would hit 20mins I think for a premade, which isn't bad at all. We would always meet at BRM (or wherever) and kill eachother or random 5man groups (yay world pvp) in between queues.

I would like you to come back to this post, when you will want to fill your raid with 6 rogues and that many dps warriors + tanks.
---
Ok peeps I’m really torn here and could use some guidance. Druid or Mage? 
---
I like Druid because I can do everything and will not be locked out of content for not being able to find a tank/heals. I also want to be able to PvP in open world and BG’s. I will be taking my time questing. My concerns are finding a raid group. I do not mind healing at all. I will not be going hard and farming MCP’s I don’t have time for that. 
---
Mage is also enticing because they do great damage, can farm well, can teleport to cities and are also good with PvP. My concern with mage is being able to find dungeon groups while leveling and competition in raids. 
---
Friends, what are your thoughts?
---
Except this example is a change to the game that did not exist in vanilla. This is not 'preserving' vanilla, it's a direct change that opens up clear possibility for abusing the system.
---
Loot trading was a creating for a different game. With the way loot is designed in classic in conjunction with this loot trading system there is great incentive for people to exploit this system to an extreme extent.
---
Yes disabling it for dungeons is a good thing, but this issue will certainly come up again when people start pugging raids. There will certainly be abusive behavior from a loot system that never existed in the game during vanilla.
---
Ignoring the obvious ways people can abuse the system that numerous people have pointed out is a bad faith argument on your end. You know as well as everyone else that this system can be abused in ways that it is not in the spirit of classic. 
---
If you want to argue that you think it's a good change, then by all means express that opinion, but don't come around here trying to act like you are trying to 'preserve vanilla'. This change stands directly in opposition to that idea.
---
Please make it happen Blizz.
---
Bid low sell normal.
---
Unless I'm misunderstanding something, AQ patch came out before 1.12, so blessings should be 15 min long...
---
Have you seen Asmongold's chat?
---
I liked the part where they didn't fight back because there was no incentive to.
---
MajinDLX invited you to join &lt;The Vegan Barrack&gt; guild
---
Lol, sure name caller.
---
Keep climbing that ladder!!
---
I want to know how many people chose an Undead Warlock based on that trailer.
---
They are right.
---
Now you're just using fallacies and the video you linked is completely wrong.
---
I suggest you follow your own advice. They never mentioned itemization at any point, only that some items wouldn't drop until X patch because they weren't in the game prior to X patch. There's not a single mention about what version of items that got buffed in 1.10 will be used. If anything, they'll use whatever version was in 1.12 since that's what they're doing for the PVP gear.
---
&gt; once phase 2 rolls around and we add the Honor System, which will introduce Honorable Kills, Dishonorable Kills, and PvP Rank Rewards. **The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12.**

I just started talking about this with 3 buddies I used to play with and it looks like we are gonna roll alliance. The rest of them claimed classes quickly which are pally, Druid, and mage, and that’s how I stumbled into this thread. 
---
Who should I roll to A) round out our group B) not fight over loot too much and C) enjoy both leveling and endgame? 
---
I played quite a bit during actual classic but was pretty young and was a total altoholic so I never made it to 60 and experienced endgame content. I’ve done a bit of research and my conclusions are as follows:
---
Warrior SUCKS to level with but kinda steamrolls @ 60. 
---
Hunter and warlock are both ez leveling but warlock doesn’t fare well at 60 till like AQ40 and naxx gear (big turnoff for me rolling a lock)
---
Priest seems neat but kind of redundant with the rest of my group
---
I actually don’t know much about rogues. 
---
What should I roll?????
---
that looks quite good! How much DPS does a BiS-geard "normal" DD in MC?
---
As someone else said, I'd get tailoring on the priest because Truefaith Vestments are amazing for a long time and they're BoP. 
---
As far as making money, tailoring bags is good cash early on in a server's lifetime. Enchanting is a gold sink and it rarely pays off unless you're doing some early raiding to get the rare patterns. In doing tailoring / skinning on my priest. Skinning is easier to level than herbalism and mining especially if you're playing right after launch. Good source of extra gold by just vendoring the leather. 
---
Herb/alch on the warlock would be good as is.
---
Onyxia attunement can take everything from an evening to weeks if you have a hard time finding groups for Jailbreak etc. It's also considerably harder on Horde.
---
MC attunement can be soloed by any class in about 10 min by using a couple invis pots.
---
Honestly just play what ever you want, you might have to conform for raids sure but thats only until you have what you want. DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!
---
So I’m a Vanilla narb. Picked up the game in the second to last patch in TBC it played till Cata then quit. My main was a BE Prot Pally and my alt was a Tauren Druid, I plan on staying Horde and my main focus is causal Wpvp and eventually BGs. 
---
So now I’ve decided on Horde. I’m thinking of rolling Druid as my main but I heard they’re not exactly the best in Vanilla, thoughts? Am I better off going shaman or priest?
---
What I've found so cool after growing up and traveling more is how WoW -- and most video games -- are based on real life. Novel idea, I know.
---
No, really. Playing WoW as a youngster, I used to be so fascinated by all of these crazy environments, thinking what it'd be like to live in them. Now, I realize that these environments ARE real.
---
The Barrens and/or Mulgore = The Great Plains/Africa
---
Durotar = The American Southwest (think: Utah)
---
The Shimmering Flats = The salt flats in Utah
---
The Badlands (in game) = The Badlands (irl)
---
And the list goes on. Some of the high fantasy areas like Teldrassil don't have direct comparisons. But it's funny to realize as an adult that WoW is, after all, made by human designers, which are drawing inspiration from the things they've already seen.
---
Not one you'd want to do while still leveling but... gotta get that Booty Bay pirate hat :)
---
So what...they had someone on 24/7 just tanking the flight master?
---
You can do MC in like 30 seconds if you get summoned. Ony takes time, lots of travelling, groups play.  It's like 24 quests or something.
---
I've heard that the mountainous areas of Arkansas are wicked cool. Is that where you live?
---
God brother i hope you are right
---
RDPS classes don't need a lot of preparation, unless you really want to min-max on the consumables. Most classes are able to walk into raids without going overboard with preparation or farming, unless you want to (or the guild requires it.)
---
Yeah, didn’t you know that Dark Souls is so mind-numbingly boring that people have to find new ways to play it?
---
&gt;at that stage,
---
ZG comes out before AQ.
---
Yes we are. The only blue posts have been about dungeon items like relics not dropping until the patch they were added to the loot tables. There is no mention of what version of itemization we are getting for PVE drops. For PVP drops, it is confirmed we are getting the 1.12 version of the PVP items, despite all of the armor pieces being buffed in 1.11.

Bro, lol, it doesn't take 600iq to understand what he's saying. It seems like you're just wanting to argue and not hear what anyone has to say or attempt to understand the argument.
---
He's LITERALLY talking about how, even though we had a certain system in the form of an rp-pvp server in the game at a later stage, there will not be rp-pvp servers in the game at classic launch because of that reason. It will possibly come later.
---
This decision can EASILY be interpreted to showcase their current philosophy towards other aspects of the game, especially ones that were not in the game from the start (ie, crbgs).
---
Same. I've got a busy early/mid summer planned and would be pretty happy with a later release date. 
---
Especially if it gives them time to address things like sharding.
---
Everyone says the gear dependence thing. But is that going to be true this time around with the patch we are going to be on. I am stuck between Warlock and Priest.
---
&gt;Any thoughts on this plan? I think it would be an efficient way to do it if you plan on having an alt and aren’t in a rush to reach 60.
---
It's efficient, and can likely obliterate /played records if you do it right. But will take ~400 days to do so.
---
Here's another post in the thread. This really should be included.
---
MC is like half of a BRD run (or less if you can stealth.)
---
Ony takes a lot more coordination, especially if you're Horde.
---
Yeah if I was going streamer server I would 100% go opposing faction.
---
It’s really going to depend on your guild, for example my guild in Vanilla had two systems in place that made life much easier for us raiders.
---
They recruited a ton of casual players and offered them what amounted to dkp for herbs/consumables and other mats. The ever couple of weeks we brought the ones that had enough points in to MC or BWL eventually ZG and let them take whatever epics weren’t needed by main raiders which since it was usually the tier behind was a lot of them. They got geared up and we always had plenty of consumables for raids without really having to buy them ourselves.
---
The other thing that worked really well was raid tax, at the end of ever raid night that we killed bosses you had to turn over a percentage of the gold you made to the guild, I don’t remember off the top of my head how much gold individual players ended up with back then, but I remember generally turning over about 10-15g on the nights we full cleared MC, probably a bit more in BWL. That money was taken and used to buy resistance gear for tanks, other crafted BiS pieces like Lionheart helms (although you did have to spend dkp for those) and  to shore up any week spots the guild had in our consumables production line.
---
What?! A Human priest AND a night elf warrior?!? What is this blasphemy?!!? /s :D 
---
Good work!
---
Yeah, I tried like crazy to front shred in vanilla.  Had to resort to front clawing.
---
Faction first, pref server first Kel'thuzad kill.
---
Fyi, you wont be using Edgemaster all the time. It's only for bosses and only if you have the correct weapon types. You wont be using them for trash, and you probably wont even use them with world buffs (Cant glance if every attack is a Heroic Strike)
---
That's understandable, but you then cited Blizzards stance on loot trading below which is entirely different. That is a true #NoChanges issue and you seem to be fine with it. 
---
You are arguing in bad faith and using examples of structure changes like pally buffs and trying to juxtapose them along side the horseshit that is loot trading. They are 2 entirely different things.
---
unclear what the post is about, dont want to visit the website.
---
Maybe a guild? Can't wait for the loot council to be as unclear as they were in this post
---
Anvilrage Warden - Added in patch 1.11.   
---
Hooked Net -  Added in patch 1.13.0.28211.  
---
I know mages could aoe in brd in vanilla, we had mages get so much gold from that instance back then.
---
Came here to say this.
---
I believe Asmond, Soda, TimeTheTatman, and Lirik are all planning to coordinate a server to keep things relatively balanced faction-wise. 
---
That would be a hell of a social experiment, 4 massive streamers.
---
No way, can't happen. This would cause a unprecedented impact in the way the *community functions.* /s
---
For your leveling... don’t level enhancement if you want to stack a ton of spirit and go staff bashing. You need some melee stats and a good 2 hander, or it will be a miserable experience.
---
it shouldnt be punished, sure - but hunter to solo farm this dungeon was absolutly not intended and was only possible because people found a way to abuse the AI.
---
I played the fuck out of mage and I love the class. Played it in every expansion since, except MoP, which I skipped. I played shittons of mage back in classic, and loved the fact you could be a wrecking ball in battle grounds. It's easy to level, it's convenient because stuff like portals and consumables actually matter in classic, it's not exactly gear dependent. Multiple specs viable in PvP, which is going to be my main focus. Easy ways to make shittons of money. My biggest gripe: it's a 1 button class in PvE. 
---
Then, there's rogue. Probably my 2nd most played class overall, but I didn't really get into it before the end of TBC. I know rogues, much like mages, are pretty nuts in PvP in Classic, even with little gear, if you use the right spec. I don't plan on doing premade BGs much, so rogue being sort of overpopulated doesn't matter terribly much to me. They're GREAT for open PvP at lvl 60, and not utterly terribly for open pvp before that. 
---
I just can't decide, guys. Probably going to roll mage, but there's this nagging voice inside my head that tells me to follow the 13 year old edgelord inside me and just roll an UD rogue named Shadowmasterpoisondeathx. Plz help.
---
That would be pretty fun. You could have some pretty fun encounters.
---
5- Bank alt
---
Wins every time.
---
ZG has enchants. It's also really good to help gear up some of the less dedicated raiders in your group to get ready for BWL/AQ. You can split your real raid core into 2 groups and run 2 20 mans and gear up the non core members a bit. I can't think of a single guild that would skip this raid content.   
---
Once your guild gets geared up with mostly BWL gear you can clear MC, Ony, ZG, and BWL in one straight run, took us about 6 hours or so for all of it. If nothing else it's extra enchanting mats.
---
Where? I loved me some WotLK
---
&gt;An example would be Asmon being likely to be the one to ring the scarab gong without much effort on his part by getting his viewers to help him out.
---
We all know this is going to happen.
---
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO! NO CHANGES!
---
You can farm Earthstrike from Silithus too when its available.
---
So the choice really is bis forever miles ahead of everything tank trinket vs doing slightly more dps in phase 1-2.
---
Yeah.  Though at best case they will get a 15 minute buff which will probably take them that long to even run to C'thun :)  But I think he was saying have both in the same raid, not using buffs from both.
---
Well presumably the streamer will only group with their entourage, not with you, so none of those are real negatives.
---
yes, much lower chance though obviously.
---
We gotta burn people down before they burn us down pretty much.
---
Do you apply that logic to raids too?
---
"I will pass MC gear because I will get upgrades in BWL".
---
"I will pass BWL gear because I will get upgrades in AQ40".
---
Ofcourse you dont. So passing upgrades preraid is equally dumb.
---
It would change the community though, Dartol's love would spread. We could all furbolg
---
Before 40, they're just Priests  :)
---
I stuck with ToA and ToEP on my lock in vanilla. I had a trinket I think on my priest but I didn't PvP with him often. 
---
My memory is a bit shoddy with PvP gear, in general, since I raided mostly.
---
I did the same thing in retail vanilla, but on a pserver Incendius was somehow harder to solo than he was back in the day.  I used to farm him trying for Ace of Elementals, unfortunately I wasn't an enchanter or it would've been easy shards.
---
Literally unplayable
---
That version is linked above by u/PreventerWind
---
The best dps 2 handers while leveling are typically staves, outside of corpsemaker/whirlwind axe/bonebiter really.
---
As for the melee stats, I am really wondering if stacking up strength would usually just end up overkilling targets with windfury, losing some of the effectiveness of them anyway, whereas spirit is always useful.
---
I stopped reading quick but if you're leveling as enhance just get a cloth int set and heal with that.
---
You don't need to sit there smacking shit in all spirit gear.
---
Get a second gear set you'll need to get used to doing that anyways.
---
And if you're leveling enhance definitely find a nice 2h hammer or something, don't go using a caster staff.
---
You have access to all your spells so just a gear swap will let you heal a 5 man well enough. Just bring water
---
Just make Deviate Delight a horde exclusive for balance.
---
I feel different now. Changed.
---
Considering in Naxx they released tier sets that were perfectly tuned for 1 spec per class? Yeah, I think they did intend that, at the time. And then when TBC rolled around and they decided to make other specs viable, ta-dah, suddenly you had several tier 4 sets per class with different functions. It's not "arbitrary", it's how the game was, and how we want classic to be. 
---
&gt; So you think we should be playing without the class revamps as well? 
---
No, because the class revamps *happened in Vanilla*. We want the classes as they were at the end of Vanilla. They aren't being dreamt up today to create WoW Vanilla 2.0. "Making specs somewhat viable" as you propose is not a minor change whatsoever, it will completely change the class balance of the game, which changes loot distribution, raid composition... suddenly you have a version of the game that never existed at any point in 2004-2005.
---
If horde has it, than what is even the point of playing alliance?
---
Paladin is easiest to go 'barebones' with in any case, if no consumables at all and no buffs just chaincast with 1 rank lower of fol and you won't barely notice in any guild lower than top tier, ultimate cheapass class (ofc you can go full consums and perform way better, but it's a way lesser gap than other classes).
---
Same with casters vs melee really. Always felt casters have much less preparing to do raidwise, yes flask, but flask is almost never 'required', maybe on releaseday but even in a toptier guild casters are never required to always flask. And flask beats actually having to farm jujus, getting blasted lands buffs etc as melee, way more annoying and time consuming in the end.
---
If you lack playingtime, just play a caster or pala. Again I saw someone ridiculously posting that soulshard take time; they won't as they're farming during raid on trashmobs, no prep needed.
---
You haven’t lived until you’ve had the hair spins
---
Who'd even call you lol man shit
---
&gt; Fake.
---
That's kinda the joke.. Jesus..
---
For lvling just party with me ( im rolling warrior) and heal me to 60.=p
---
Staffs are great. Use an add-on to swap to spirit gear when out of combat. Start healing dungeons earlier. 56 is fine for BRD.
---
Add ina to the end and you'll be fine :D
---
Because on reddit, anecdotal evidence = fact lol.
---
thanks for the reply. Yeah, the more I am reading, I think I'll take the plunge and get back into wow. Our kids are now 7 &amp; 5, so I could play casually most nights for a couple hours. 
---
Defo wouldnt get to raid, but still a lot of fun to get to 60 and for UBRS and the other 15 man &amp; 5 man stuff. 
---
I loved Alterac Valley weekend being a healer.  Defo plenty to get involved in and if it stays truly classic, then only the top players will out gear everyone even after new patches.  
---
Getting to Marshal took me a lot of time...basically playing 10-12hrs a day for weeks. (think I even remember skipping University in the last two weeks). Just didnt have the time to push for Field Marshal or Grand Marshal....that was a huge time sink.
---
You can get a 7200 HDD mad cheap bro!
---
Really wonder if there will be an armory for vanilla 👀
---
if you are stacking  spirit  as shaman to heal dgns. You need to play by the 5sec rule and that might be hard when healing as shaman, since shaman and paladins have no talents to make spirit regen more incombat.
---
No it fucking isn't. Just played on pserver and have played with druid healers for almost all content I've done (from 5 man's to bed) and have NEVER heard someone complain about a druid healer. This is a myth.
---
I wouldn't go to that link. Morons that push post titles like this and don't give any information in the comment section doesn't deserve any recognition. Downvoted.
---
poor mages. omegalul. 
---
ppl level them cos its convinient. they are self relient, food, water, teleports, they dont need anything. they dont need to gear almost at all, you get to 60 you buy some +int and +stam items, and you can start farming anything. you get full 4 bags to fill, unlike hunters. you don't depend on arrows or anything. they also can port around which is convinient to deliver your loot to mail/vendor/ah and get back.
---
And farming process is entertaining and you can farm multiple things, compare it doing one run as a hunter 1000 times.
---
Also you don't need to know how to do tribute run or mara or anything. you just level a mage and just go get free gold instantly.
---
As other guy said you can farm spectators, and there are multiple farms in general, you don't even know and you can combine it with multiple things and profs. for instance i used to famring brd and selling ubrs key at the same time, so i can easily go have it opened. ever thought of that, when you are saying something is for sure...
---
even if you couldn't do bigger pulls in brd you can still farm it i pretty sure, with smaller pulls, even i there are 3 mobs that fuck you.
---
Also you can play mage in pvp, without much gear at all and have fun and be competitive.
---
so even if hunters are abit more effiecient, mage is just more worthy to level and more convinient and entertatining and diverse aswell. and more fun farming in general. and it still gives a ton of gold, which what you want.
---
In AP Pre-BIS I did about 100% less AOE dmg against a corehound pack, and about 40% less dmg on Golemagg!
---
Yeah, the gear swapping idea is something I thought about, I just wonder if the bag space it consumes would be worth it. Would probably need an addon like outfitter or something right?
---
Also, note taken on the 56 for BRD thing, thanks.
---
That’s true, just keep track of what has the best stats.
---
You still need some strength, windfury procs won’t completely balance out white hit damage. And while spirit is useful, remember that it doesn’t help your regen in combat unless you use the five second no casts rule. Spirit is a decent leveling stat but keep in mind that shaman has no talents or way to use it beyond a basic level.
---
Strat live reserving orbs (1 or more) is common.
---
If you have a healer friend then DM E jump runs work, too. Just remember to be a miner (an enchanter would increase g/h as well).
---
Let's get this upvoted so hopefully someone at Blizzard might see this.
---
&gt;Plus classic won't really be that competitive, nothing's ranked as far as I know etc.
---
?? Classic will have PVP rankings.
---
It is literally a ranking system in which you earn ranking points in order to reach a certain rank. It is not intended to be a grind, but the flaws in the system make it one. These same flaws are what remove the requirement for skill. 
---
These are bugs, not features.
---
I happen to play on the most popular streamers server in retail. Trade chat is a bit more obnoxious, the huge population means the AH is flooded and cheap. Overall does not impact me much.
---
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND! D:
---
Crystal of Zin-Malor.
---
Technically not a quest reward, but you wont be able to get it back once you complete the quest. It can be used as a tank to break several CC abilities from bosses in raids like Blind on tiger boss in ZG, and Cyclone on Ossirian in AQ20.

The whole point of this thread was to state opinions. No one is wrong here, yet.
---
Casuals are going to play at the release date and if doing anything is extremely frustrating then we could lose out on a lot of potential players.
---
I think sharding or dynamic spawns for the first couple days is a good thing for the longterm health of the game.
---
If you want to build a classic wow similar to what it use to be you have to keep the noobs around. I dont think the starting zones will ever be under as much stress as they're about to be.
---
Hi, /u/gti_time
---
All the hate about it being a “meme spec” aside, wouldn’t Ret paladins have it worse getting ready for raids as they have to get all those dps consumes as well as all spell related consumes for consecration and judgements as well? I thought that’d be the hardest...
---
Right the idea would be, frontload all my spells at the beginning of a pull, lightning shield -&gt; shock -&gt; fight
---
then let spirit regen me.
---
Where I am from, yea. It's definitely beautiful in it's own unique way. The people can be questionable and there is a dark underbelly.
---
Tanks who knew this back then were my goddamn heroes. All both of them
---
Heck, if your kids are 7&amp;5, they’re old enough to queue for bgs. You might end up getting Marshall after all...
---
I loved my shammy i nthe early days. My plan if I cant play regularly will be to level as resto, but have two sets of gear for DPS and healing. 
---
I dont plan to level super fast, but loved healing in Groups, so thats my plan.
---
Was a masturbation joke my dude
---
Yea it makes sense but if they want classic wow to feel like how it really was they shouldn't push casuals away, dynamic respawns or sharding for the first few days would help keep the casuals around. The starting zones will be under mad stress, I'd imagine it would be hard to even grind mobs.
---
Yeh I also found it disturbing, always thought RP-PVP was more popular than regular RP servers. Really hope they change their minds and open one per region, we don't ask for anything else.
---
If not we'll do as some of you mentioned, designated PvP server and will flood it!
---
Why are you rabbling on about things irrelevant to this topic? We aren’t talking about mages in PvP or anything like that. This is strictly for gold
---
Farming purposes.  Other classes beat mages at gold farming. Doesn’t matter if it’s entertaining or which bags you can fill. This is about gold per hour and nothing else.   
---
I’m just trying to end the debate about which class is the best gold farmer
---
Got me quakin'
---
Defenitely a better idea and good to hear man.
---
Explain the video then?
---
To be fair, some of the Onyxia stuff you should be doing while in your mid to late 50's for the XP and dungeon run alone.
---
The numbers will be largest right at release and the few months following it. Having RpPvP servers only later doesn't really make a lot of sense.
---
Derp. Downvoted.
---
I wish they would make it so shaman could dual wield in classic. I know it’s a big change but it was my favorite part of bc
---
Relax, buddy. Of course there are druids healing/tanking in every aspect. The op was asking if it will be easier to get a position as a shaman or druid, and the answer is shaman. 
---
I actually mained a druid on nost. I healed all content, and even tanked a little in bwl. I 100% DID get declined numerous times trying to join as the healer in 5mans when they didn't have a res. I would have to convince them no one was going to die, before I would get invited some times, also. I always had a raid spot though, that wasn't much of an issue at all.
---
no way! I'd get Ganked by the wife!!!!
---
Depends on what kind of buggy it is. Does some sharding malfunction happen, and all of a sudden theres 3,000,000 Hoggers spawned at the same time? Or is it a lamp, like they talked about *at length* at Blizzcon?
---
I'd rather wait if theres alot of the flaws the Demo had. I'm sure the team knows what they're doing and will notice glaring issues like that. But I think we can have our cake and eat it since the game itself is rumored to be wrapped up, and they still probably plan for July. Just judging by the "have a classic summer" comment and the conspiracy theory.
---
I would imagine they took shifts but... I didn't play a tank in vanilla. IIRC taunt put you up to the top threat on the threat table, so another tank could just taunt it off if need be. Idk how they kept it off healers tho.
---
not to mention the second they quit, population would drop instantly.
---
Yeah, you'll have something better, because players that choose to play with shitty specs will go from holding their raid back a massive amount to holding their raid back a little amount.
---
It's not as drastic a change as you are implying. It's fixing problems that's should have been fixed and would have made the game better. Just like how class revamps fixed problems and made the game better.
---
You don't say, "well let's roll out class revamps in the order they did in vanilla as the phases go out" because "that's what was in vanilla". That *was* what was in vanilla, and it made it worse than it could have been. 
---
 No, even you say "keep the fixes from the class revamps all the way from the beginning". You're saying they should do that because it will make the game better *despite not being true to vanilla*.
---
That's why almost everyone is also OK with not having DKs, because they were a mistake that added little to nothing good to the game.
---
There's nothing wrong with fixing problems because you can absolutely do it without losing the feel of classic.
---
I'm not saying.
---
Yeah, I'll tank, any healer will do really. Then get a mage, rogue, and a hunter. Those runs always go super smooth.
---
I envy you.
---
1.12
---
rollsafe
---
Classic wow will be 1.12
---
I think what you gotta do is picture the day to day. Questing, doing a little farming, travelling from place to place. Without thinking, which class do you imagine doing all that on?
---
My hockey team embarrassed me for the rest of my life last night, please let this be the thing that cheers me up today
---
You need to accept that playing a shaman life after 60 will require you to obtain FULL BIS healing gear and you need to be speced for healing in every raid ( if you want to be in a raiding guild that actually clears MC/ONY) its the only way you will be useful in raids especially since everyone is so under geared in the beginning.
---
Your focus on Hand of Edward and iron-foe are absolute crazy talk. You are basing way to much of your entire char around these items. Iron-foe for one you would never get, as its a COMPLETE waste on a shaman. 
---
The spec is nutty as well considering you would be wasting time trying to melee people lol. Either full on Elemental spec, full resto or elemental/resto hybrid are going to be your only good specs early game at 60.
---
Treat them as two seperate games. If you don't like one, don't write the other off. A lot has changed over a decade and a half, the two games are very different. 
---
If you're interested in Classic, I recommend you give it a go - especially if you've been playing BfA and already have a subscription.
---
Watching his demo footage... what a nightmare. I just wanted to watch him play the damn game, but thats hard to do when you have dumbasses circling you like attention starved vultures.
---
Yes, start with Classic. Worst case scenario you don't like it and you're out $15 for a month.
---
Just adjust your thinking for the long haul. Who do you want to be "your main" for the next few months/years?
---
Do you want to be cool? Funny? Clever? Do you theme your characters (greek gods, zodiac signs, game of thrones houses)?
---
Start thinkin now. I say leave your old character behind, create new memories, but stick it out and don't shift gears mid-game.
---
Classic and Retail are 2 diffrent games. you can try both if you want to, it will have no effect on the other.
---
Have you considered Shaman. Very versatile and great in PvP.
---
Lol why are you confined to 1 set of gear? Do you have some sort of religion that forbids it?
---
That's an amazing screenshot. Ugh I loved that about vanilla. Except my death was eventually dying at TM if we got pushed back. Lok'Tar Ogar, motherfuckers.
---
Party members only.
---
5min Party buff-
---
It's hard to say really, as a new player retail would certainly hold you over until Classic comes out. On the other hand, it's possible that it could teach you some bad habits for when you end up playing Classic, and imo certain elements of retail are way too confusing for new players (mostly story-wise) without having the context of pre-Cataclysm.
---
Personally I'd say to wait until Classic comes out. You're in a really unique position that most of us envy, being able to play World of Warcraft in its former glory, but with entirely fresh eyes.
---
Right but what he's saying is the nets weren't added until 1.13. If they're going off 1.12 data then the wardens won't have the ability.
---
It depends what you are looking for.  In my opinion - Vanilla wow was brilliant. It was harder and took longer to level. Players knew their class when getting to level 25+ due to the time invested. By 60 most players were good at their roles (well good enough to run 5-15 man instances).  There was a great sense of achievement. 
---
This disappeared for me, when there was more and more expansions, and less time to work on your characters. When all the expansions were released, I felt it lost that sense of working for something. People were instant high levels, gear was easier to come by, gold was in mass supply. 
---
While people can still get all that if they want with, with Classic wow, I'm hoping its back to what it was. Personal progression will take time and effort. I stopped playing at the end of 2012, and I'm massively looking forward to reactivating my account and getting back into wow when Classic is released.
---
I'm not saying I agree or disagree with the idea that a beta will happen, but beta test for classic would have nothing to do with testing design elements of a 12 year old game.
---
They rebuilt the game from scratch on a new client based on the data they had from the old game. The testing would be to help with identifying bugs from porting the game.
---
It depends, as they are two very different games. As has been noted in this sub several times, the current iteration is basically an action MMO with very little RP or social aspects. The Classic version promises to be more immersive and social and will be a bit of a grind, but ultimately much more rewarding if you prefer a sense of accomplishment vs. instant gratification.
---
At the same time, from a game developer perspective, would their game had been able to reach the amount of players it did during wrath if they didn't develop content for casual players as well as hardcore?
---
Agreed
---
cos there are more factor than that, when ppl decide what class they gonna level. 
---
gold per hour for different farming methods depend on ah prices, stop bullshiting ppl that something is for sure. end of the debate.
---
Unironically; who fucking cares..  why does words on your chat box offend you 😂
---
+ Herb skill also I believe.
---
Yeah, I feel like I remember getting better gear in mc/zg than the pvp gear unless you got R12-14. I only ever got Blood Guard, so I didn't lose a whole lot by killing anything at will. My permafrost blizzards will rule city raids once again.
---
Unless you are running hardcore progression in Classic there should be zero worry on your end about Paladins wearing cloth.
---
This sub can give returning or new players the false idea that unless you min/max the first week after hitting 60 you aren't viable for MC. It's just not true.
---
TLDR: You don't have to wear dresses as a plate class to be "optimal"
---
The gear looks so good on humans tho and tabards. Maybe mess about with the setting, try some randomised looks and see if any speak to you.
---
My warcraft story begins in the late vanilla era around 4 months before TBC released. My epic journey began at the crown of the earth as a night elf hunter whom I struggled in my young age 10ish to comprehend the groundbreaking game mechanics that World of Warcraft offered. That woodland warrior only made it to around level 40 at which point I decided to reroll a new character which I felt suited my play style much better. From that moment on, I dwindled in the mystical powers of the mages. Since then, I have mained a mage but leveled many other characters that have brought me thorough joy for the past few years. I have played and leveled 20 different characters of which 5 were mages, 3 paladins, 3 druids, 2 warlocks, 1 hunter, 2 rogues, 2 shamans, and 2 priests.  
---
Now that classic is on its way, the time has come to decide. What do I roll for this epic journey back in time?  
---
I have always been an alliance player. But, this time around, my group of friends and I have decided it would be best to roll horde in order to get a more sincere and authentic vanilla experience. For the life of me, I cannot decide what class I should roll. Should I roll a mage?, a warlock? or a druid?. I thoroughly enjoyed each and every class during the past decade and am completely torn between what I should take. A worthy note might be that within my circle of friends there is already a warlock and a mage but no druid. I don't believe this should even be a weighing factor in the decision as we will play what we want to play but maybe you guys have a different opinion. I personally feel that the utility of the mage is exceptionally important in vanilla.  
---
Any advice?
---
No Applachians?
---
Well, they could at least farm mats for you. These kids are young, they need to learn the value of hard work! Nothing comes free in life. Unless it's mats for you. Then those are free by proxy. But they don't need to know that.
---
'just look at all the debuffs on him!'...
---
meanwhile you have almost every buff possible.
---
Thats why I think they should be an early addition, and not 6 months in, yeah. So Blizzard realizes the boom is bigger than they expected, and even if the population tapers off a bit, theres still a higher number than they made servers for. So they can add a few as a safeguard against having legitimately too few servers, and add a whole bunch of RPVPs. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if theres under 15-20 servers worldwide at launch, and I also wouldn't be surprised if thats way too few.
---
What people are playing on in retail doesn't really matter for Classic. All surveys show a clear preference of the community for PvP realms over PvE realms. That goes for both regular and Rp servers.
---
There was no real difference between PvP and PvE realms during the last few expansions of retail WoW. The difference was so unimportant that they decided to remove PvP and PvE realms like we knew them in BfA.
---
The petition is of course not representive for the whole Playerbase of Classic. The people on discord servers and on reddit are the very core of the community. Thousands if not Millions of others are going to follow, of which many will want to role on a RpPvP server.
---
Loatheb comes to mind.
---
It's pretty unlikely that Lupos is going to do shadow damage.
---
Honestly, as somebody who actually had to go through the process of taming him on private servers once upon a time, consider yourself lucky you won't have to do it.
---
Np! We are an EU-guild, will raid  Tuesdays and Thursdays at CET 20.00 -23.00 and we look for ppl that look to participate in 1-1.5 raid/week on average (you can ofc be away for periods, just meant that we dont' demand 100% attendence). We want to progress but don't aim for any serverfirsts. If this sounds interesting, join our Discord  [**https://discord.gg/92V5CCD**](https://discord.gg/92V5CCD)  and chat with us and see if we seem to share goals etc
---
Avoid retail.  Dont spoil Classic.  It's nearly here.
---
I’m not trying to stop people playing a mage. I’m playing a mage myself, they are a great class. But when I hear people say they are the best gold farmers, it just isn’t true.  Mara runs vendor the loot which brings pure gold into the game so the AH is irrelevant for that.  And If AH prices are skewed so much that items like cloth are going for way more than expected, mages would still have to deal with the open world griefing and competition they will definitely receive.
---
15-20% dmg? Im doing 40-60% wand dmg ehile leveling on my priest.
---
Yea, I agree with sharding. Hate having to fight tons of people for tags. Occasionally against a few people is fine. To me that isn't why I'm going to play classic. So all for it.
---
My comment was more about casuals just not caring about how fast they level. Though if the slow leveling is due to extreme crowding, that could be offputting for them, I agree.
---
I'd hazzard they just kept him sheeped.
---
Go play modern wow then
---
Imagine rolling against the streamer on gear and having just a swath of there mindless followers freak out on you because you took "their" legendary or epic. And that's only 1 of many problems that could arise.
---
Yea miss me with that shit.
---
Definitely rolling a Tauren shaman with Herb/Skinning and bank toon with Alchemy and Enchanting.
---
If you're in the opposing faction in a hardcore guild that will dominate the server it could be fun. Other than that I'll take a hard pass.
---
If you want the in game chat to turn into Twitch chat then by all means join a streamer server.
---
I only play RP realms. If they don't have any at all... :(
---
Doesn't offend me, just not interested in the entire server culture being based around one guy because he's "Twitch famous" or whatever.
---
You people need to seriously quit it with begging for a release date. Let it come out when it's ready. Don't rush the devs. I'd rather wait and have a good product then a rushed one
---
YOU CAN DO IT WITH INVISIBILITY POTIONS TOO!
---
Sure, no one likes that. But they still are not worrying about where they end up. The issue is frustrating play experience. The two are related, but not the same thing.
---
Bfa bad, Classic good
---
Does the 1/29/21 feral hybird PVP spec use intellect gear as its primary stat? That is what I heard, but it sounds strange.
---
They are too bouncy for me, always jumping around and spinning, I prefer human male melee and dwarf male casting
---
Yeah I’m not looking for a super fast progression system and from what all the people say about vanilla it seems way better than the actual game
---
I volunteer as a tribute.
---
It doesn’t, shadow weaving does increase shadow wand damage though.
---
Ah yes spending gold on an extremely easy dungeon quest, I suppose if you really can’t find a group for one of the shorter, easier lategqme dungeons.
---
Not that your idea is bad I just think this is finding a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Wand
---
No, just a skill increase.
---
noobs at its best :)
---
It’s a speed increase as well. I went to a vanilla wow head thing.
---
Yeah but the pve crowd will play retail because the Look for a challenge. The only challenge in classic is naxx.
---
Definitely hoping for RPPVP!
---
The air hump kamehameha? Or the right arm raise? Both terrible. Had a male NE druid and was so happy when tree form came in TBC. So much better. Then they ruined that too with giant stupid tree form on CD. Boooooo
---
Top-quality
---
I think your expectations are WAY off.
---
4 days played is like the world record for leveling to 60.  In order for someone to have a level 60 in the first 4 days, they would have to know exactly where every quest is and every mob to kill and every turn in and the absolute fastest routes to take, and they would have to play nonstop without sleep for 96 hours straight.
---
Even if someone was speed leveling, but could only play say 8 hours a day, it would still take them minimum of 12 days.
---
Let's say someone speed leveling could only play 2 hours a day and 4 hours on Sat and Sun...it would take them 6 weeks to get to 60...and that's only if they knew the methods to get to 60 in 4 days played.
---
The average person will take 6-10 days played to get to 60.  At say 2 hours a day average, that would take 72-120 days IRL to get to 60.
---
Now most people will not be speed leveling like this.  Most people will be enjoying their leveling in Classic, and doing gathering professions, and crafting, and fishing, and cooking.
---
Most people will take 4-6 months to get to 60, so you're fine.  Just do you boo boo.
---
You mean Southrend?
---
Looks like my choice has been made, classic sounds like its far more fun and nostalgic ( not to me ) but to other people
---
Yep. It would just be a fun cool event imo. Not unlike how some private servers let the legendary amulet from MC drop once per server and then never again.
---
Yeah then they get close to you and spin spin spin
---
hahaha, I feel you man
---
As a BfA player, the recent change in developer attitude towards players is actually one of the things I'm sort of hopeful about. Almost all the "bad changes" to WoW in the past has been because of player complaints. Nowadays it does not seem like Blizzard cares all that much what players say, for better or worse, they just make the game the way they think it will be enjoyable. Granted, they have failed in that regard in many ways in BfA, but I think they can make something actually really good out of WoW if they continue with that attitude. 
---
Like sure, server communities are basically non-existent on retail, but it's not at all impossible for Blizzard to introduce changes that would bring it back, even without compromising most of the QoL changes of the past. Class and item design is shit, but if they just stop listening to the complaints from players and try developing what they think is a fun system it could become really good. 
---
I'm not saying developers shouldn't listen to player, obviously they should. But they should decide what they do with that information themselves, they should not work on some "fix" to a problem just because players are suggesting it. Players can always identify problems, but they are shit at coming up with sustainable fixes for it.
---
Source...?
---
My experience (pservers, so take with a grain of salt) is that mages tend to be overpopulated because everyone knows how viable they are in every form of content. However, druids have less raid spots allocated to them for a variety of reasons, so really it comes down to finding the right guild.
---
I would focus more on picking a classic that you will enjoy holistically. They are hugely different roles, so you need to really think about whether you want to heal or dps. Mage dps is a bit boring IMO, but if you dont mind it then that is a good option.
---
I listen to this when I'm in the bathtub.
---
Undead females also have boob physics. Nothing like playing a living skeleton with bouncy milkers.
---
You can start it earlier but your options on turn ins are very limited. You can do the giant killing thing at level 58, which is faster. I think, lol.
---
Hell, i recently did a full desk renovation so that its done before classic comes out. I plan on hiding away when this comes out. Glad the kid knows how to cook her own food now. lol
---
USA- Nevada, still looks like the spot for Desolace.  How accurate.
---
They're not for absolute bellends
---
&gt; doesn’t offend me
---
&gt; also don’t want to see it because it would make me feel negatively towards the server culture
---
But not offended though
---
😂👌
---
Haha do a quick google search on the racial in vanilla wow. It’s called Cultivation.
---
Naxx is something else man. I did 40 man Naxx raid at level 70 and we struggled to get through it.
---
I don't see how anyone would think cross-realm BGs would be a good addition to Classic. I played BGs before they became cross-realmed and frankly I saw little to no difference in queue times. It depends on the realm and it's population/peak times, generally. There will always be moments of 10, even 15-20 minute long queues.
---
I've made so many friends (and nemesissies) from when the battleground was only for my own realm. You met the same people over and over, making it way more involving and personal, if I can call it that.
---
[1. General] [Astroid]: ORLY?
---
Yeah, it's quite crazy how RP-PvP is even more popular there than PvE and RP combined.
---
I did, it’s just a skill increase...
---
Thats subjective. Do you want hunched over? Go horde if you want spinny go alliance. I really enjoy the gnome animations
---
Make a wish.
---
Thank you alot !
---
What's the best way to get in contact with you? Discord?
---
I did a bit back in retail when it was current and wholst it was hard given time it will all be farm content
---
derp on my part
---
I'm guessing  August 8th
---
Get all your things that you need to get anyway first. Attunements, lockpicking to 300, first aid to 300, professions. Then do every quest that gives preraid gear such as the In Dreams chain.
---
Once you are done with everything like this, its time to start farming Epicmount and do dungeons for the rest of your prebis.
---
Orc females in full plate hiding their stupid faces look pretty cool. Once they show that mug though, all set
---
Totally supporting this one!
---
At all? No. It does.
---
Enough to warrant aoe loot? No, and I wasn't suggesting that. I was just bringing up a point.
---
No need to be so defensive.
---
Nice, i'm glad you went through the trouble of testing it in MC before I did.
---
Someone playing 20 hours a day and sleeping for 4 would take 5 days to get to 60 if speed leveling.
---
Someone playing 16 hours a day would take 6 days.
---
In case anyone was curious.
---
These are all based on the 4 days played time.  Now if you're leveling a Warrior or rogue...forget all these numbers lmao
---
I think what you need to be worried about is what your life is going to look like after you lose your family and house after you start playing.
---
Why isn't lfg monday stickied?
---
This is your original argument in the chain, I believe:
---
&gt; By that logic then, 1.0 talents from the phase 1, 1.12 talents in phase 6 then? You are confusing content release with patch release.
---
nochangesevenifyoudontlikeit
---
I've provided anecdotal evidence of Blizz giving insight into their content/system release philosophy, which happened to be about server populations and rp-pvp realms, which can be used to surmise how we might expect other things to be handled (in this case, crbgs). 
---
But everyone just quickly dismisses everything without taking the time to understand what's being said.
---
When did ego become a part of anything? If anything, this comment chain points toward you, and your ego, being unable to understand reasoning and the lack of an ability to comprehend what's being said. You just attempt to shutdown whatever is being said against your perceived fallacy.
---
I camped for him when i played vanilla, only to notice that he wasn't doing shadow damage in my chat log. turns out that thottbot didn't have updated information on the no special damage situation... :v
---
Their healing animations are great but man their models are just terrible. Neutral on the male animations so I usually go that route
---
I'm also in your boat, I'm just waiting until it releases.
---
Yes.
---
You mean WoW Earth.
---
Do people think that by spamming this sub with release date requests blizz will change their mind on when they will announce?
---
Farming mobs for gold in 2019...
---
Problem is they have no spells that scale well with +sp and no instant styles like whirlwind, sinister strikes, bloodthirst that scale with +ap or weaponswing, so technically it really does not matter much if they use consumes, because their DPS will remain crappy and only become marginally less crappy whereas a warriors DPS goes through the roof with +ap and crit.
---
You know I never took the mining animations into consideration
---
Stuck between the same 2 classes as you, only reason I’m probably going to go rogue is because one of my close friends I’ll be playing with a lot is already dead set on mage.
---
Do tradeskill animations differ much? I know mining does, but skinning/herb/crafting does that change?
---
The only problem that exists is my constant need to one-up random strangers on the internet. I have become everything I hate about this sub.
---
I was messing around, I'm just really bad at jokes.
---
I remember this haunting shit! I was in the AH minding my noob business and suddenly everyones panicking.
---
But *muh server community*...
---
PvP maybe
---
Semi easy fix- swap character models in your files and bam! Fem NE appearance on your lock
---
Probably because the way the blue posts appeared was the same as the spam for those topics here lol.
---
&gt; But you can make leveling more interactive and efficient by weaving in auto attacks with a slow, hard hitting staff between wand shots. This is because your melee and ranged attacks are on different timers
---
I dont remember this at all tbh and I am pretty sure this is a private server bug.
---
Darn, I’m in NA, sadly. I’ll have to keep looking. Thanks for responding though! Good luck to your group :)
---
jesus christ dude, yes i know there are farms, when you just vendor stuff, thanks for enlighting me.. but something is better or worse only in comparison. when you evaltuate mthods you compare it to other methods. and OTHER METHODS PRODUCE MORE GOLD DEPENDING ON AH PRICES, WHICH BECOME BIS FOR THIS SERVER or time frame at that time.  So you cant say something is bis, for sure in all cicumstances, okay?
---
one of my most sucessful gph farms was doing SM and getting small radiant shards cos there werent any on ah and high demand with high prices. or stacking large bril shards and presenting them at the right moment when ppl craft oils, and they are in high demand. and so on.
---
from my book mara runs are relatively average method of gold farming, did it myself aswell. if you don't know better gold farming method you just don't know them, its the problem with you. mages farms do much more gold than mara. also pickpocketing is just meh method in terms of gph, saying its the bis gold farming method is ridiculous. in my book at least. 
---
on the other hand hunter tribute runs are very good. though as i said it depends on ah for other methods. 
---
where did you saw ppl saying mages are the best? noone says it, its just one of the methods of GOOD gold making in vanilla.
---
ppl level mages cos its an easy, reliable method and entertaining gold farming. not cos its the best fo the best possible. its just ONE OF the best ways to make gold, which doesnt require much from you.
---
What if they only enabled cross realm if people in queue is below a certain number for your server?
---
Nice try. I will still be a mage, cya around farming spots.
---
They permanently ban people in heroes of the storm if they criticize their teammates too much. And I dont mean bad criticism, I mean things like "Try to play safer, dont engage when they have number advantage."

Classic Wowhead: "**Cultivation:** Herbalism skill increased by 15." [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20552/cultivation#changelog](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20552/cultivation#changelog) 
---
There are two variations it seems.   
---
The second link is from Wowhead classic. Maybe this is the correct one?
---
Im aware, used it myself too. I just wish that it wasnt a thing and make things more challenging. I know its not realistic thing to hope for, but in ideal world I personally would like to see it gone.
---
The one thing im not sure of is if the edward proc will be eaten up by casting elemental mastery. Things work weird in vanilla so that may need a little testing. If it does eat the edward, you may be better off ditching the bottom 6 points of elemental and putting them elsewhere, and only cast timed spells on edward procs.
---
I dont see Blizzard going through the struggle to timegate what is relatively minor stuff like this. Remember they initially only wanted to do 4 phases. If ZG wasnt important enough, this right here absolutely is not
---
Yeah I looked but couldn't find anything. The only video I have of a warlock soloing scholomance during real vanilla is the one linked in this post. There is one on youtube of warlock using a voidwalker for it, but he's level 70.
---
Sorry, I’m just too used to people unironically pushing even sillier “strats” and trying to tell people that they’re good.
---
Yeah the world is getting soft and Blizzard will prob follow suit. It’s sad.  People are just gigantic babies and pressure companies to kowtow
---
Yeah, I was confused by that as well... solo ran for mine back in the day. Also, it was never required, there are better daggers and ones that don't take up a debuff spot with a useless bleed.
---
Exactly. The first one is from retail.
---
God I'm right there with you buddy. Fucking refreshing these forums on loop day in and day out. I want my planet back!
---
Well, something better in your mind. The community seems happy, to me at least, with what we're getting, which is the game we asked for, not Vanilla 2.0.
---
You can still play those specs. Nothing is stopping you. The hardcore guilds will not take shit specs and they still wouldn't take them if they were slightly better. But what you're talking about is simply buffing all shit specs, meaning overall raid DPS for the groups that choose to take shit specs goes up and the game gets easier.
---
And where does "problems that should've been fixed" end? Because what you're describing is what Blizzard did in TBC, just to a greater extend. So where does it end? Do they "fix" the 16 debuff slots? Because that's something Blizzard also decided at the same time wasn't working as they would have liked. It's also a huge fundamental change.
---
&gt; No, even you say "keep the fixes from the class revamps all the way from the beginning". You're saying they should do that because it will make the game better *despite not being true to vanilla*. 
---
But it is true to Vanilla. No, we aren't getting them in order just like we aren't getting bug fixes in order. But those are how the classes ended up while still in Vanilla. You're describing balance changes that were *never* part of Vanilla.
---
"Almost everyone OK not having DHKs" while being purely anecdotal is also meaningless because guess what, they're here to stay. They were were of the game. You were either a dishonorable civilian murderer or an honorable soldier. Your call.
---
Once you go Classic you dont go back
---
Because it’s literally all we have. I mean you can e-mail Blizzard or call their customer support number and hope for the best.
---
Offense != apathy, are you literally 11?
---
Train your kids to gather herbs and mine for you. Fun for the whole family.
---
Pretty much I believe but as it says it only lasted for 5 hours before a GM reset the flightmaster :P
---
As others have said, depends on what you want. Classic is an "old" design mmo, retail is more like an action rpg in my opinion. If you are not sure what you want, I'd wait and try classic. Better to not spoil some of the effect by learning about things in retail. Give it at least a month with at least 50-60 hours played. If you don't dig the slow play style and overwhelming nature of not having your hand held through everything, try retail.
---
For example, questing to level. In classic you'll have to actually read the quests and guess where to go to complete them. In retail, you pick the quest up and your map tells you where to go without reading the quest text at all.
---
If you end up switching to retail, you'll find yourself flying through the levels and everything greatly simplified. You won't worry about having spent a month trying classic. You'll be able to use what you learned anyway and catch up to where you were in classic very quickly.
---
Hearing dependence is true regardless
---
If you're playing on a private server, equip a quiver/ammo pouch and your ranged attack speed (ie your wand speed) will increase, increasing your DPS. This may have been a thing in Vanilla or just a bug restricted to private servers, unless we can find someone who remembers trying it we won't know.
---
Yes! Warlock
---
I've been trying to get my wife to play. She probably thinks it's just because I try to get her to play video games a lot, but she doesn't realize it's so that she doesn't leave me when I get addicted hahahaha....haha... ahhhh. We may have a problem.
---
You're the reason Vanilla has turned into BFA over the years.
---
Yea you probably did it after they normalized him.
---
I had to camp him for ~72 straight hours with a couple of naps here and there between spawn times to get him on private servers. The thing is it's not just about taming him, it's about hoping other players, same faction or not, don't grief you buy killing you or Lupos it while you tame because they are salty.
---
Theres 5-8 people camping all spawns at all times 24/7 on release.
---
Yes, defiantly play! Ill echo a lot of what has already been said here, we envy you! WoW vanilla was and is a truly magical game. Its a rare game that truly rewards your time invested. No pay to win, no hand holding. Its very unappologetic but also so rewarding. If you can, check out this video by Kargoz, he does a great job summarizing 5 reasons to play WoW Classic.

---
Go luck, but just make sure you roll HORDE!!!
---
So many bear asses have been collected that bears are now extinct!
---
The lamp is in the wrong place and the lightbulb is a slightly different color. UNPLAYABLE!!
---
I certainly did.
---
&gt; On the other side, undead female got the lamest melee-animation.
---
Heretic, they have the best 2h animations in the game.
---
Whatever you think it's intended to be, it wasn't.
---
Was there any attunement for Maraudon (5man I believe)?
---
I far from have every buff possible btw.
---
Go to any popular streamers Twitch and look how the chat behaves. You might be lucky to read 3 words before it already got scrolled out of the text box, because people spam incessantly. 
---
No more LFM/LFGs for you when people spam there.
---
Undercity of Machu Pichu...lol... That would make for a great book.
---
That's straight out of the Southpark episode.. when they call to complain that some player keeps killing them.
---
I’m not sure what you mean. 
---
Do you mean that it wasn’t intended to be what I think it was intended to be?
---
Or do you mean that it didn’t end up being what I think it was intended to be?
---
I’m leaning Druid pretty heavily because I can be independent while leveling. I really want to enjoy my ride up to 60 and do all the content on my way there. I really like tanking so I think I’ll go feral. 
---
Mage just calls to me for some reason idk why.
---
You are in Tyrs Hand farming, streamer with his entourage of 250people rolls in, fun for you disabled.
---
Eventhough NZ is on this map, it might as well be /r/mapswithoutNZ
---
People on this reddit is somehow deluded enough to think hundreds of people will follow around a streamer all day, and it will be all hell and chaos. 
---
I wouldn't play on a "streamer server" but this is a terrible reason why.
---
You get that a lot on this sub the "ACKCHUTALLY THISSSS IS BETTER ..." people.
---
So is Australia STV or is it the Middle East? HMM
---
I would totally wait to experience WoW with the launch of Classic.  But if you want a taste, join a private server for a bit.
---
harder as in more time consuming, let's be honest, naxx doesn't come close to modern mythic progression or pushing highest keys possible, but keys are a cheat anyway imo, as it's just the same dungeon with higher numbers, but the skill required from the player is much higher anyway
---
Dwarf Hunter. You will dominate rogues. Stoneform removes blind. If they jump you just scatter/feign/trap. Get max distance and game over. Rogues felt like free kills. 
---
Another option: reckoning paladin. I could take multiple rogues on at once. Even did a 1v3 and won. Reckoning destroys rogues.
---
I think female troll have my favorite cast animations in the game, actually. I really hate their melee animations though.
---
I use [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGs0bZZVMGdctRt](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGs0bZZVMGdctRt) for end-game PVP and [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrs0bZbAzzZVMgzcu](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrs0bZbAzzZVMgzcu) for BGs.
---
I’d strongly recommend starting fresh with Classic in a few months.  Just treat it like a brand new game that will be releasing in a few months and forget that the current iteration of WoW even exists.
---
We messed up the order a bit due to the Blizz news update last week. Fixed now.
---
&gt;Note: Mages can NOT farm BRD. It's confirmed by footage back then that there are 3 mobs that will hinder you from doing this farm.
---
False, there's different ways to farm BRD and there's one that avoid all said mobs and still give pretty decent gold if mining dark iron is good.
---
Hunters are top tier PVP class at all stages in the game.
---
Just try it on a private server, not a better way as a demo-version experience before knowing if it will work for you or not.
---
Source?
---
Nah. Not far. You're pott'd to high hell. If you need to pop mongoose and giants and shit to do damage in MC then it won't get far.
---
Whaaaaat, I actually really like their melee swing animations - at least for 1h/DW. They're definitely not as good as both male and female Human though. Human melee animations are just solidly the best overall across all weapon types, imo.
---
My friends and l would definately roll on an RP/PVP server if available at launch. However, getting them to switch servers later on would probly be a no go. =(
---
&gt;  seemed to do a lot of damage.
---
I could be wrong, but I thought in 1.12 that DPS was standardized across types? So for instance, different cats would have different attack speeds, but all cats would average out to the same DPS.
---
Uhh casters can't compete with rogues/ warriors in DPS without using flask of spell power. So I mean unless you don't care about doing the same DPS as hunters throughout vanilla, ignore flasks. 
---
I played on a recent pservers as a warlock and during aq40/naxx I would spend 300-400g in comsumes just to be in the top 5 dps. Some weeks it varies by how successful the raids were and it provides motivation for guilds to be better and use less gold in consumes. This is using the pservers black lotuses in spawn formula. Using the 2 hour lotus spawn(lol) of vanilla I would assume it would cost me 500-600g a week.
---
Because having half the server pop level mages/hunters/warlocks to sit and farm dungeons over and over for gold is NOT authentic, even if the goldfarm is.
---
Oh certainly. It's not impossible, especially since game theory has come so far.
---
SM/Ruin for life
---
I picked undead for my lock because of the cinematic.  I may have chosen it anyway, but the cinematic sealed the deal.
---
I really hope my guild &lt;Orc Forge&gt; and I have an RP-PvP server to call home.
---
Fuck it's still 90 days to July 16th? That's forever from now
---
Source? The fucking dungeon mate. You can literally just go through the gate to the left of entrance, kill the fire lord, then move on and pull things from there, no warders in sight.
---
how bout both
---
Yes, though I don't consider this "farming". This is playing the market.
---
My wife has never touched a video game outside of Just Dance. That’d be a monumental task to get her interested in WoW.
---
Shiiit if he’s right me too
---
Not using mongoose etc. in MC is pretty selfish imo. Well, of course that depends on what guild you are running with. If you are a super casual, yeah you might not want to use any consumables, and that might be fine for some guilds. 
---
I can agree that spelladin is not for super casual gameplay.
---
Can confirm did not work in classic
---
We're biased here, but I'd say don't try the current game if you want to experience Vanilla with fresh eyes. Hear me out.
---
In the modern game, the entire level 1-120 experience is flawed, and Blizzard admits that leveling is awful. So you are going to experience everything that the original game has to offer, but with horrible gameplay and a non-existent community. You'll just spoil the original game with a 14 year version that makes that original game mutated and off.
---
I'm not even saying you shouldn't try retail, I'd even say you should, but experience 1-60 on Classic first to keep that experience whole. You only get to level your first toon once, and the leveling experience is awful on the modern game. Also, in Summer you'll get two games, Classic and BFA, for the price of what you'd pay now for one, just BFA.
---
That farming method isn’t as good as what other classes can do though
---
I really want to like NE male but I just can't. Their idle stance has a ridiculous amount of movement to the point that it actually annoys me, and their torso/arm proportions are so unnatural and weird. Their animations are decent (except their 2h swing which I really don't like) and I like the fantasy of night elves, but I just can't stomach playing the male version on any class except Druid.
---
That’s when we get excited for fresh
---
What this guy said \^
---
Thanks for the essay
---
I play retail with my 7yo daughter. While we don't do anything intense, she does get a kick out of healing me up while we hunt for cool looking items. Or make money to buy mounts/items. 
---
I mentioned the original wow was coming and she got pretty excited to try out the game from the beginning. I'm glad she wants to play because my wife wouldn't be down with me checking out for 2 hours to play a solo game. My daughter has become my wingman lol
---
You should give it a try though, after you've played all of Classic, it's an entirely different type of game that works completely differently.
---
You think streamers are going to farm anything at all? People literally open trades with them and send over 5000 gold at random.
---
Well that's everywhere, I suppose.
---
Dark underbelly. Like Ozark? (The TV show; haven't actually watched it)
---
If they are a good player, they will avoid twatwaffles like you.
---
First character I ever made was a dwarf hunter that cinematic had me so hyped!
---
Then what does the green text mean?
---
It isnt a mob pathing issue.  It is the npc fps animation.
---
How is it not authentic? If it was possible back then it should be possible when classic releases
---
I do this, thanks.
---
You are assuming progressive itemization while this isn’t confirmed. So far posts seem to imply the opposite.
---
because EU is 3 months behind US
---
i can pickup a classic like super mario or half life 2 and just pop it in and play it any time i want 
---
true classics
---
vanilla wow was the classic mmo the one that touched milions of people around the world.
---
Ill take the classic version as close and true to 1.12 im able to get thanks
---
much love
---
#nochanges
---
Wish you were right, but 90% sure its going to be more like this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mczb2LAYrMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mczb2LAYrMo)  only in level 50 questing zones with the ganksquads at level 60.
---
Couldn't have just posted this in the active "nochanges bad" thread eh
---
You can use the /who command, that's what I used back then. It will only show you online people but you can filter for leveks/zone/class/etc. Not sure if the armory was there in vanilla or not, can't really remember that but I think it came after launch.
---
My reply was only in regards to the res thing in 5mans but I've never seen it be an issue.
---
Idk? Sounds like an error in functionality.
---
What...you want me to run DS/Ruin?
---
LF Guild...
---
.
---
I am fully committed to playing RP-PVP if Blizzard is so kind.
---
Hi, /u/farqual_hakkar
---
Fans of 2007scape said the exact same thing, but they very quickly realized that changes had to be made for the game to be sustainable. Despite making changes, 2007scape is now several times more popular than Runescape 3.
---
Changes are inevitable unless you want the game to die.
---
wow at level 13 a true marvel
---
Perhaps the same will happen with Classic WoW, but there's no point in advocating for a 2007scape approach yet. It's best to see where we stand after the phases are over.
---
10/10 race fantasy for your friend lol.
---
Private servers have been running the same content for over a decade and WoW is not Runescape
---
b u t    o k a y
---
So you're saying that the system that was called a ranking system in which you earn ranking points to earn a rank was not actually intended to be a ranking system, but rather a grinding system?  
---
I'm saying that it was intended to be a ranking system that rewarded skill at a higher level than time spent, but due to its flaws, ended up being a ranking system that rewarded time spent over all other aspects. It's still a system that ranked players. Ostensibly, it was ranking based on skill in PvP. In reality, it ranked based on time spent playing in BGs and camping flight points.
---
?
---
Do the lava run!
---
Depends on what you want to achieve.  I'm only going to play, if I play (1.12 ew), 8 hours a week if that.  I'm going to take my time to 60 then chill out.  If I'm able to do dungeons I'll do some for fun.  But other than that.  I have 0 expectations.
---
Raiding isn't what it once was. On the pservers I played on high-end guilds would pug out their MC runs when farming TF. I was able to get into pug MC raids every Saturday and they were typically about two hours long.
---
So as long as you aren't playing a hunter you'll be able to get T1 with minimal time invested if you're willing to wait for big guilds to have it farmed out. If you only play 3-4 hours a week, it'll be farmed into oblivion by the time you hit 60.
---
Imagine being vegan unironically.
---
Big yikes
---
Totems only benefit the group that you are currently in.  And for this reason they are usually put with melee dps groups.
---
Delayed for sure. But I have rarely encountered game breaking bugs
---
They'll be much more disruptive to individual servers in Classic compared with retail because no cross-realm and no sharding (outside of starter zones, in the first few weeks, allegedly). The population caps will have to be reasonably low in order for that to work, which means a single big streamer easily could saturate a realm, let alone a couple of them. And most of that pop will be there just to follow the streamer around instead of doing anything normal. So if you're not into that, it will be like playing on a dead realm. Also be prepared for queues any time the person is streaming, and graveyard level pop at any other time.
---
I'm pve only and planning to be full classic. I did play vanilla long enough to taste early raids, but not ever on farm for anything. So it will be a fresh experience.
---
I dont like the loot pinata/overload of retail and the arms race of complex fight vs addon simplifying. It's not satisfying. I'm all for simplier fights where time can be spent just having fun, hanging out, chatting, multitasking while you raid...etc.
---
If I do ever reach full Naxx clear, will probably just start over with a different character and role. So I plan to invest in classic for at least 3 to 4 years. After that, maybe retail if classic doesn't plan new 60 content. But at that point, more likely just look for a new game.
---
Harder in terms of non-raid combat as well. Pull 2 people and you're in trouble. 3 and you're dead. Accidental pull in a dungeon is often death.
---
"People" might be pissed yeah, and the down votes for my comment show that, but vanilla was in a feature freeze at the end and many nesseccary or cool things (karazhan) were shifted to TBC. So I look forward to improvements
---
Some bits are likely wrong in a network packet from the server.
---
Already a member, unless i can be a member twice and get double the powers?
---
I totally agree. Paladins in any form of progression were holy only, and even then we had to rely on non tier and even cloth gear to be worth anything.
---
Druid is a pretty solid pick for classic. They're perfect leveling companions for friends while leveling since you can tank or heal any dungeon up to 60. At endgame PvE you can heal no problem as Resto, and you can tank 5 mans without needing to commit to feral. You can also decide to take tanking seriously and go full Feral tank, since the spec has been theorycrafted recently and it has been found that Ferals are actually excellent tanks (both OT and even MT for many encounters). You can even do respectable DPS as a cat after the discovery of the MCP and combining it with powershifting. 
---
Druids are also amazing in PvP. Best FC class, and excellent utility class. If you're into PvP, I'd go on Youtube and check out Blossom's Druid PvP videos. Crazy stuff.  Only meme spec is Balance, but you can play oomkin in PvP if you really want to.
---
Right... but we don't even know retails sub numbers right now. I imagine it's probably floating between 2M-4M. This patch will probably give it a bump, but I can't imagine BFA pushing more than 2-3m at the end of it's lifespan. And then it will jump up again when expansion 9.0 comes out. And rinse repeat.
---
Meanwhile, I think if they release Vanilla&gt;BC 2-3 years later&gt;Wrath 2-3 years later, the entire Classic conglomeration could have more servers, *when Classic hits peaks, and when retail also hits droughts*. Sub numbers go up and down, and if Blizzard spaces out releases by a couple months at least, than there will especially be those peaks and valleys. And during one of those, I bet Classic will surpass retail.
---
It’s probably one of the strongest abilities too. The sound effect, the animation and the damage all come together for one roasty toasty spell. 1.5 cast time with no projectile high crit chance with talents.
---
Hi, /u/_BreakingGood_
---
Yeah I play druid so female tauren druid is pretty awesome when you're bouncing around mashing hots with your hands in the air like you just don't care!
---
But yeah the models....
---
I'm really enjoying this modern world where every guy with a keyboard has the ability to voice his brilliant opinion.
---
I really ***like*** *it.*
---
It's funny that I know the maps and every little detail of them of Azeroth and Outland better than the street names in my own area.
---
Ony chain as horde is long and tedious alliance on the other hand it's quite easy.
---
You can't trinket stuns as a warlock. And your biggest enemy is rogues. A good rogue can kill you without you even getting a single spell on him. Thats why orc is the best.
---
ally= shit
---
Except they reset those servers or shut down after a year or two.
---
Show me one private server that has been around longer than 3 years that is past the naxx cycle with more than 1k players. It doesn’t exist.
---
If a tank let u have ironfoe, it means he got TF
---
Druids only have battle rez in classic
---
Runescape is by far the best model for what happens when a classic game is remade. If changes are made, the game grows and prospers; in the case of 2007scape, becoming far more successful than the current version of the game. If the game does not change, it stagnates and dies.
---
Go Mage. The farming potential of mage is just too good to pass up. You can AoE level and also grind dungeons for respectable gold per hour. Excellent DPS spec. Excellent PvP class with variety of specs you can mess around with. You bring lots of utility to a bg premade too with your CC and burst.
---
Creating a new thread instead of posting in one of the million exsiting threads on the same topic is a flawed way of posting...
---
I think the best way to re-hash Vanilla, is to wait til BC and Wrath have had their lifespan. And then, while still offering the original games, create some kind of mutilation between the three, or just rehashes of each.
---
Female Orc titties are more my flavor
---
&gt; But it is true to Vanilla. No, we aren't getting them in order 
---
Because it's not true to vanilla. In vanilla, we went months with classes having problems that needed addressing. Half of vanilla had wacked out class problems, but in classic it's going to be fixed from day 1.
---
So it's going to be a *massive* change in how players level and what the experience is like for some at level cap, depending on your class. This is a *very large change from vanilla*, therefore, it's not faithful to vanilla either. 
---
Warts and all, amirite?
---
&gt; You were either a dishonorable civilian murderer or an honorable soldier. Your call.
---
Except that you often had zero choice in the matter. No matter how many times you say "no dhks" in group, some bozos can still do it. Which meant the only purpose DHKs served was to *discourage* world pvp, and not prevent any of the behavior it's meant to address.
---
And that's the problem with you lot in the "\#nochanges crowd". You actually can't even talk about the game mechanics, you don't even care about the problems of vanilla. You don't even want to *try* to create an experience that's even better than vanilla. "leaving the fixable problems make it better, because nostalgia"
---
Except of course if Blizz says that's how it's gonna be.. if they say it, fine. Until they approve the changes (like class revamps from day 1), it's sacrilege to even mention it
---
1.12 was a pretty polished and functional mmo
---
we are getting features like addon support of the modern client 
---
you cant really compare wow to runescape
---
they can also release bc servers at some point maybe a year after nex and allow players to roll there or transfer there classic characters
---
a lot or people just want to play the game as it was 
---
i also dont trust blizzard with changes , they have a habit of changing their games to suit the most casual timmay players that exist. retail wow is still available to players that find classic clunky or slow
---
Don't forget the shaman revamp, which they only did not do in vanilla because TBC was around the corner anyways.
---
There won't be a RP-PVP server. There is in no way enough people to justify it, regardless of polls. You have to remember that while this is "Vanilla" WoW, I would bet that the server capacity will be that of the modern game. They are going to want as many people on each server as possible.
---
You're right. BFA is actually good. That's why all the content creators are leaving the game and Blizzard's stock value is at an all-time low since years.
---
Username checks out.
---
Ah yes, the mountains of San Francisco. Besides that, looks awesome!
---
You definitely should wait.  110% play Warcraft rts series for now or read Christie Golden books
---
I've been playing on a certain instant 60, server with easier gearing, so I'm just kinda trying to gauge opinions on what's the best to thrive in the as you called it "shitshow" I enjoy all three classes, just want to play whatever I'm gonna feel the best about in full gear
---
Depends it can consume as much time as farming lol. I’ll be farming my warrior main.
---
I'm glad you know precisely how many people will play Classic!
---
There are solutions to prevent hand holdy changes, simply by having the player base vote for new changes (the same way Jagex does it) and require a super majority to pass anything. This allows good content that wouldnt harm the integrity of Vanilla to pass (like new battlegrounds or raids), while ensuring content that would be bad (Garrisons) do not.
---
Do\*\*\*
---
\#triggered
---
Okay, so Blizzard resets the servers after a while. Or makes fresh ones. Or does TBC. Problem solved.
---
OP's post is the millionth of its kind and they're all dumb, it's why they're constantly shot down, because they're asking for a new game, when the *entire point* of Classic is reviving an old game, not making "Vanilla WoW 2.0". Just because it worked for Jagex in a totally different game doesn't mean it'll work for WoW.
---
Heh, I knew he was going to do paladin next
---
Nah nah Robinson. Gall-Peters looks dumb as hell
---
I waited 600 days from season 7 game of thrones to 8. [MFW](https://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/i-can-wait-gif-7.gif)
---
lol, “anecdotal evidence”? You have literally read between the lines of a tweet and drawn up a conclusion (guess) as to when xrbgs if/when will be implemented. Do you see me stating when and how things are to be. No.Your opinion is NOT fact.
---
I still say ego due to your deflection of anything other than your interpretation, telling others they “don’t comprehend” when clearly they do and your outright dismissiveness “bro, you are arguing with me”.
---
Nothing has changed still, I want xrbgs because it makes individual server faction balances moot”there WILL be imbalances”, it provides a much larger pool of players to play across all brackets, and it speeds up queue times.
---
That’s it.
---
Unbalanced world PvP. All the contested territories in Africa and there are no flight paths there.
---
No, it definitely does take as much time.
---
Willing to bet you were born well before 1975.
---
So salty.
---
Druid is one class where private server meta development has actually improved greatly. Resto is viable 100%. Yes, your healing output isn't quite as powerful as a priest or paladin, but you bring utility like innervate and battle rez. As long as you know your class and spec, you'll be fine.
---
 Feral Tank is also extremely viable nowadays as well due to private server players developing the Druid meta further. Feral tanks are actually stronger than Warriors at the Tier 1 level, but end up falling a little behind warriors around T2 due to gearing. They catch up again in AQ so it isn't an issue, though. I'd recommend watching Skarm's videos on YouTube to learn more about Feral tanking, he talks about it in depth.
---
Finally, you can also do Feral Cat DPS. The discovery of the Manual Crowd Pummeler combined with powershifting allows for a Feral to put out respectable DPS. Not quite top tier dps like Mages, but you can easily be top 10 DPS as a Feral. I'd check out Shedothedruid's videos on YouTube. He explains the spec and playstyle in detail. It's a rough spec to prepare for and requires lots of farming to be able to put out good dps, but some people enjoy that extra grind.
---
Finally, in PvP Druids are insane. Best FC class, arguably best PvP healer due to mobility, and excellent utility. I would watch Blossom's Druid PvP videos on YouTube to get a better grasp of what Druids can do in PVP.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Retail is a good MMO for casuals who like building up a virtual character and collecting stuff (gear, mounts, pets, etc.) and whatever else they do. And it's a good game if you like very challenging group based action-RPG type content (dungeons and raids). 
---
Classic is a good game if you like more old-school social MMORPG type content. Basically the same as retail WoW, do quests, level up your character, get gear, kill some dungeon and eventually raid bosses. But it's a much rougher design more focused around immersing yourself in the world with other players, and less about providing a "refined" experience. You will have to do boring things in the game, but the idea is that the reward you get from the fun stuff feels more rewarding than if everything is going great all the time.
---
They should. The plague was basically an unintended world event for ZG, like Hakkar spreading misery across Azeroth.
---
Main a druid on a private server and cant tell if trolling
---
Finally, someone bringing that true 2004 experience.
---
Thanks...
---
No worries =)
---
Rad, thank you.
---
Bug with respawn timer. Only 1 known instance where it worked and it took 3 days.
---
What's ur dps on lucifron
---
One of the many differences with Runescape is that that game was killed basically overnight by a single update, as far as I understand it. WoW was more of a gradual decline over the course of many years. There's *absolutely no way* of knowing if changes/additions to Classic would actually make the game worse. Why risk it when you're already providing what the majority of people are actually asking for? 
---
I could see the argument for *separate servers* with new content, but realistically, that probably ain't happening.
---
I'm copy pasta-ing my reply to someone else asking about druid:
---
Feral Tank is also extremely viable nowadays as well due to private server players developing the Druid meta further. Feral tanks are actually stronger than Warriors at the Tier 1 level, but end up falling a little behind warriors around T2 due to gearing. They catch up again in AQ so it isn't an issue, though. I'd recommend watching Skarm's videos on YouTube to learn more about Feral tanking, he talks about it in depth.
---
Looking for Guild!
---
NA, Alliance 
---
Who I am: 
---
I am a university student in the US who started playing WoW around TBC/WoTLK launch and am looking for a guild to raid classic with or people to level to max with. I have always tanked at a casual level with IRL friends but am looking to heal on my priest in Classic and learn to push into higher raid tiers. I have always had a love for progression raiding but was unable to push in previous expansions due to time constraints, so I am looking to make the most of Classic.
---
What guild I’m looking for: PvE oriented guild on any type of server with a focus on progression but with experienced players that push one another
---
If if you have any more questions, feel free to message me!

Resetting the server will piss off all the “it’s a museum” “don’t want my character deleted”, people.
---
I don’t think it’s as easy as you think it is.
---
NO CHANGES right, gonna need that item rogue
---
Or when out of Hot Pockets.
---
Ahh ok what about auras like leader of the pack and trueshot aura?
---
&gt; If you want a funeral where you don’t get tanked by a rogue have one in real life.
---
I admire your optimism.
---
Crescent staff is very good. However wailing caverns can be a drag when you roll the dice on a random group. I personally like to skip it and use the staff from the anarachophobia quest that gives I believe 3 stamina and 7 intellect at the same level. So if you’re doing wc Bc u think u need this staff, there is an alternative that although obviously weaker, gives pretty good stats.
---
Might have taken hours in 2005 if your person with rep had a potato for a PC and it took 5 minutes for each loading screen :P
---
Looking for a group of friends who want to recruit a warlock caster in their group. Looking for a mage, a prot warrior and a dedicated priest healer
---
Think i have to test every race...
---
we're generally trying to replicate the game, not the player behaviour of classic
---
No-one farmed pummelers in Vanilla
---
It’s spirit versus letter of the law. They’ve made it clear that they are willing to support the 1.12 letter of the law, but that there are circumstances where the spirit (and their pocketbook) is more important.
---
Were these unnerfed gold farms within the game in Vanilla? Yes (letter).
---
Were they prevalent in Vanilla? No (spirit).
---
For this reason, I can see Blizzard going either way.
---
Obviously there was no Hyjal zone but could you still see the world tree in vanilla?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong:
---
You're advocating for a system in which 1% of the most charismatic population, using forums and social media, create a perception of consensus around the things they want and then the vast swath of people who don't really think about the issue vote lock-step?
---
it wont, i woke up today dreading going to work. 
---
counterpointed.
---
Homie, this is amazing. Exactly what I was looking for. I’m still pretty set on Druid because feral seems so fun. 
---
When my brother is online we will be duo leveling Pally/Warlock so I’m stoked about that too.
---
My guess is this Friday. Might have to make a post also haha.
---
You would want to have herb on the same char that has alchemy because of the black lotus.
---
when the game comes out people will beg for shit that makes progression easier i dont trust the masses 
---
its really for the best that they dont go changing the game for the vocal majority , they should obviously fix mistakes in the port and bugs but thats about it
---
Until you have an army of fan-boys corpse camping you, because you unknowingly ganked streamerlord
---
There were glitches to get up there and you could see the world tree as well as Archimondes skeleton.
---
People are really salty about classic for some reason, years before blizz decided to release classic people would shit and downvote any classic posts.
---
Everybody see this? This person makes new accounts to post specifically in this subreddit. This person is also a complete fucking idiot.
---
Not a coincidence.
---
Your name matters in Classic.
---
Yes, you could exploit your way into the area and it looked pretty much likes the Hyjal raid in TBC
---
Don’t die then, scrub
---
Just in case:

And that's the key thing. A single shadow priest is desirable for a raid because of their support spell...not their own DPS. If you can manage to be that shadowpriest who secures that raid spot, that's fantastic...but 1 spot out of 40 doesn't make for good odds for all those other shadow priests.
---
I’m actually gonna get an SSD
---
I think you meant to put this in the Looking For Group Monday post.
---
What does the black lotus do
---
Thank you for the very detailed and thoughtful post! I have a lot to think about that’s for sure. Is it hard to hear druids for Resto/hybrids?
---
Yes, just go back to all the other games that Blizzard has announced a “summer 20xx” release date for. Pretty much every single one has ended up in late August or September.
---
never said they did, but that doesn't mean they won't in classic, and I can't think of any spec or class that has it worse for preraid consumables
---
i like their combat stance with 2h but their swings look sort of weak and slow and lazy?  same with human females imo.  with the males they actually look like they're trying to hurt the enemy lol
---
In vanilla, Druids only had a battle rez.
---
It's so beautiful.
---
That is completely stupid resetting will turn people off.
---
The idea of starting anew is just stupid and will make people bored. 
---
Furthermore turning into tbc just contradicted your no changes...
---
The cognitive dissonance is real within the no changes fans...
---
why dont rp pvpers just play on pvp servers and rp there?
---
actual question , cant you just make a rp channel or something?
---
how is rp even enforced on a rp pvp server?
---
this. is. not. runescape
---
Druids can be great in vanilla, they just take a lot of work.  They are more healer than hybrid in vanilla vs tbc.  For less work a shaman or priest can do more imo.
---
Haha epic mate
---
In PvP maybe. Even then, they aren't great even if you are good at playing them. In PvE they are a joke to play. My friend used to afk auto attack on Rag and still do noticeable dps.
---
u/superstar9976 gave great advice about the druid and I'd second it all. Only follow-up would be to ask what your friends are doing. If they've already decided, that might make your choice easier if you're all going to be playing together consistently.
---
I suppose that depends on your definition of "going full blown". I'd say telling someone to kill themselves over their performance in a video game is going full blown.
---
The space below Ahn'Qiraj was a blast to explore. You can access it pretty easily on the Vanilla client from Land's End Beach (southeast Tanaris), then running westward up the mountains through Un'Goro and into Silithus. I hope some of these locations are still accessible in the Classic client.
---
MC is extremely quick... less than an hour for non stealth classes,  like 5 minutes if you stealth, lava run it as a rogue or Druid.
---
Onyxia is a relatively long chain and can take quite a bit of time depending on how quickly you’re able to find groups for the dungeon parts.
---
Yeah that’s why I’m kinda torn. I’m probably going to be more of a filth causal this time around so maybe Shaman is a better route.
---
No you just said something really goddamn dumb, got called out on it, and have been trying to walk it back as "I dont agree I'm just saying people today are supah snoflakez!" which is really only serving to show that your really goddamn dumb idea came from a really goddamn dumb source.
---
You look weak and wrong, hence downvotes.
---
Yeah you can, but you can only do MC once a week, so got to spend the rest of your playtime on something else. And later on in the patch you will need decent dungeon gear to compete for raid spots in already established guilds.
---
I think what gets some people to think we will have to wait until August/September is simply not having a release date yet. But Blizz has often announced the release date about 2 months prior.
---
The Osconty theory and the fact they said we will have a Classic summer are still strong indicators for an early summer release. Unless we get other "hints", July 16th is still our best bet.
---
There's the naming policy first of all.
---
Secondly PvPers and RPers will clash, just ask anyone who has tried to RP. Events will be ruined by toxic players unfortunately.
---
Been playing druid for a few years now on private servers, here are my 2 cents. The hotw build is good, especially for beginners and when you've just hit 60 since you can raid, tank dungeons and PvP with it without ever respeccing. I'm going to use this for the first two phases myself. As for gearing, you want items that have all the stats. You can look up items like Bonering helm, wildheart kilt, songbird blouse, boots of the shrieker and death's clutch to get an idea of what i'm talking about. If an item spot (like cloak) don't have any item with mixed stats you want high stamina and armor. This spec and full feral are both good at start and you can farm noobs in the open world with them. If you are serious about PvP you shouldnt use them after phase 2. Because when it comes to high end PvP against the best players they are not the best specs.
---
Again, you're as pedantic as the OP in your definition of "no changes". People are *well aware* that it obviously means "some changes". It is literally impossible to do a version of vanilla with no changes because they don't even have that data anymore. It's also not 2004 any more, *we know that*. 
---
No, we don't care about the problems of Vanilla. Guess what, there were problems in every single patch of WoW and there still are. But Blizzard constantly "fixing problems" is what got the game to where it is now. They saw content inaccessibility as a problem. Guess what happened? WOTLK, and the subscriber count stopped growing. Funny how that works. So what's to say your proposed changes don't have the exact same effect?
---
No, we don't want to create a new experience that *you* deem "better than Vanilla", we like it as it is. 1.12 with phased content is a perfectly acceptable compromise to a problem that has no concrete solution. Nostalgia has nothing to do with it, Classic will not be successful because of nostalgia. Those people will play until the problems get too much for them to handle and then leave. Good. Let the people who like the game stay and play it.
---
And finally no, not "if they say it, fine". You've clearly not been following this project very closely because there have been several backlashes to what Blizzard have said (loot trading, phases) and they've then changed their proposals based on our feedback. If the majority of the Classic community truly want Vanilla 2.0? Fine. But it's plainly obviously the majority don't.
---
Big if true
---
Druid gearing is actually pretty easy since most raids only bring a few, so most of the Druid healing gear will probably go to you (as opposed to a shaman, since you're probably competing with 7 other shamans in your raid). In terms of tanking, most of the best gear for Tier 1 tanking comes from your prebis and a lot of that actually lasts you until AQ/ZG so gearing a tank isn't too bad either.
---
That video was amazing
---
Vanilla wow had changes planned but was put on hold because of TBC's imminent release.
---
Its not a given that we will have changes obviously but it poses a different scenario on what Blizzard will do down the road say 5+ years into Classic.
---
I dont need changes but i cant help to feel bad about ppl wanting to play fx ret pally, feral druid etc. in raids and they cant cuz the specs were horrible for raiding back then.
---
Lol, i remember using....AVR? i think it was at some point.  You could draw stuff on the floor or whatever and send it to other people.
---
I dont even remember which fight it was, but at some point i had a dick drawn off in space or something on one of the boss fights.  Never did figure out which one it was to delete lol
---
This reply tells me everything I need to know. You've missed the point entirely. You don't know what "anecdotal" means, you don't know how to comprehend anything I've said (not once have I stated anything as fact, other than the tweet (which is a real tweet) and the fact that crbgs were not in the game until the end of vanilla, you're still on about some kind of ego, and we're back to square one while deflecting toward another point. You want crbgs in from the start, because you think it's a better experience. I don't want them in from the start because they weren't in the game until the end of vanilla, and were added to solve a problem which lean servers might never run in to. I provided anecdotal evidence of blizzards philosophical stance on similar issues, and you dismiss it as being non relevant. I think we're done here.
---
Yeah I totally agree that they should enhance the classic experience but these dumbasses think it’ll be the end of the world if they don’t do anything that’s not the original WoW.
---
actually I would like if they would implement it like some private servers have it. You click on your dungeon you wanna do and it shows you people that are also interested in the dungeon. You still have to form the group yourself and talk to them but you can get a quick overview on whos available before /who whispering every tank on the server.
---
Perfection is masturbation.
---
There's way more than that mate :)
---
And it all comes down to nosts 7-10 k pop, which I don't hope will be the population cap for classic servers.
---
As soon as we got the release date you'll get my upvote.
---
buhu
---
Ok awesome thanks for your insight!
---
lol yes, Southrend! 
---
\*still in development phases
---
You're wrong and sound like someone who doesn't think much before speaking up.
---
So which player do you think the guild would rather pick for a raid spot? The one who farms for consumables every week, or the one who don't?
---
I know on private servers that this isn’t the case. I’ve gotten a hand proc and have used ele mastery chain lighting on a mob of melee on me. Fun stuff.
---
If you're looking to do mostly PvP, druids are amazing. They aren't going to nuke as hard as other classes, but if you put in the time to get to know the mechanics really well they are amazingly versatile. If you go with something like the standard Heart of the Wild build, you can do everything without changing your spec.
---
We have been playing together for over 10 years. No reason that would change for classic. Only thing is I don't believe my choice should be made in response to someone having "taken xyz class". Definitely, going to consider the druid advice given by superstar. Maybe it would feel like an even fresher start if I play a class I haven't played as much.
---
I dont care really how long they take, but obviously the longer the wait = less patients if it all happens to be a shitshow on launch...
---
So was the entire Sylvanas arc.
---
Tap, sacrifice, gain three colorless mana.
---
That's hard to say. It depends a lot on the exact droprates on the various farm spots, on pservers it's been fairly competitive at 60g/hour doing it correctly, but both that farm and other farms could be different in classic.
---
Seeing this just makes me so happy.
---
WC can drag but it’s worth an attempt imo. Arachnophobia is also a group quest iirc?
---
I don't think it's a good idea either. Doesn't mean it isn't an option.
---
The boredom argument is actually totally contrary to what happens on privates, people prefer to start fresh than play the same content again.
---
Introducing TBC does not inherently mean "change the server over". 
---
Think next time.
---
See other response. I think it's also a bad option, but it's still an option.
---
The true classic experience.
---
Very well, I accept your defeat.
---
Have a nice life in whatever battle group you end up in.
---
Haha so true.
---
It rewards skill plentiful just not without BG's. Remember there was a ranking system with no BG's for 7 weeks. 7 weeks. 
---
In BG's skill is a huge factor.
---
The Founding of Durotar was my favorite campaign in WC3, and it's a major reason for why Jaina and Rexxar and two of my absolute favorite characters in this franchise. It was easily the campaign I replayed the most when I first got into that game.
---
How does one get so fat in a place where there's only moss, plants, flours and other types of greens? She must be binging her subordinates. Or her slain enemies.
---
I like your channel. Quality content.
---
playing nelf only for the backflipps
---
If that was true blizzard has many made mistakes already, so I doubt it is.
---
That's my speculation.
---
But at this point, I quit WoW for FFXIV and I've been having a blast. Classic is a draw, but the first month is going to be an absolute shit show anyway. I plan on waiting for the dust to settle so I can enjoy shadowbringer fully, then bum around in classic later.
---
You don't need to do an Emp run of BRD.
---
If you get a group of 5 whose only purpose is MC attunement, you can be done in 15-20 minutes with a lava run.
---
I'm going to do nothing but pyroblast. Wanna group up?
---
So most of the streamers are from US? Sweet. Is there any big streamer in Europe to a kid on servers?
---
They can play those specs, just not in min-max guilds. It will not be impossible to clear Naxx with a ret pally and a boomkin in the raid.
---
Thanks, Satan.
---
First thing: don't forget vanilla leveling is very slow and you'll spend a *lot* of time with your character. So focus first on what you'd enjoy playing. 
---
Assuming tanking and healing will be covered between the paladin and druid, then rounding out your group might be best with a hunter or rogue. If you're worried about leveling alone then go hunter.
---
&gt; Most current gaming laptops will run classic wow fine 
---
Shouldn't even have to be a "gaming" laptop. The specs from any modern laptop off the shelf should exceed what was considered a good desktop gaming rig back in 2007.
---
I feel like that will be me though... Should teach the scrubs to level up quicker /s
---
Enjoying your ride to 60 is key. It's not a quick ride, so you have to have fun.
---
Sounds like you should go druid and then later roll a mage for an alt.
---
&gt; Very well, I accept your defeat.
---
Further proves my point that you're just here to argue against any point contrary to yours (while completely failing to understand the conversation), for no reason other than to argue. Cy@
---
Apathy is a lack of feeling not feeling negatively towards the server culture.
---
One of my friends that plays FFXIV and I were talking about this. Early access to the expansion is actually Friday June 28th and I really wouldn't be surprised to see a classic launch on the 25th of June to counter the early access. 
---
You think about it and this would prevent a lot of people from even going to FFXIV, and would help keep their sub numbers up without losing subs and trying to regain them.
---
Please remember to "brb smoke :)" while everyone else does the corpse run.
---
What roles do the Pally and Druid want to do?
---
You said you were an altaholic. Which classes did you like the playstyle of? Any top 2 or 3 classes you were already thinking about?
---
Go on....
---
Yeah but what the fuck is wrong with asking for second opinions? Something to compare my spec too to see what other people think? sit down bitch
---
It’s possible, I think they are more likely to counter it with 8.2 though and classic being a bit later, but who knows.
---
Okay, maybe 200, but I've seen fights like this in Vanilla with just as many people. Especially when new content first releases.
---
So basically living up to the name "huntard". Gotcha.
---
Word sounds like a plan. Getting pumped haha.
---
Thought we were done sire?
---
Tuck tail and run.
---
Black lotus was changed to be BoE in Patch 1.7, so it should be BoE in Classic.

I need my fix

I think classic will have a LOT bigger playerbase the first month compared to bfa
---
When you want to rank, only honor count.
---
Correct. Maybe he had a 2.0 speed, which made for big hits
---
Looks cheesy imo.  Could fulfill that dank post-ASoIaF Arya Stark RP tho
---
There's a chain to complete a staff that lets you take the portal to inner Maraudon. You can always zone in through the purple or orange portals without the staff.
---
I guess it depends on how offensive you want to be in PvP. Shamans are very offensive healers. In fact, the optimal PvP spec is an Elemental/Resto Hybrid. You can dish out excellent damage while healing (while providing support with totems ofc). Priest is much more defensive but I'd say is a more powerful healer. Figure out the role you want to play. Each class/spec combination cater to different roles.
---
Ah, I overlooked the part in your original question about not caring what your friends rolled. My bad. You're definitely right that you need to enjoy your own class first and foremost.
---
If you played and loved every class, then maybe pick what you played least or played longest ago?
---
Or - and this is another point for druid - focus on the hybrids because you've done everything already. In my opinion, the druid is the best hybrid class because they can be good at all roles: heals, tanking, melee DPS, and ranged DPS (perhaps not in raids ...).
---
 You better think about it baby
---
Yeah, this was them fighting over who kills the Dragon, they weren't there for rank or honor.
---
lol
---
That's troll, yo
---
Yea we're done, since you have nothing left to add to the topic. Hopefully you learned a couple things =).
---
Dead*wind* Pass
---
Hey friend, if you would like, I'm going undead warlock and looking for a priest,warrior friend and you fit that description. I am a vanilla veteran who is very knowledgeable. When we can do 5 mans we would only need 2 dps and we can instant summon them to the instance using my warlock. For a lot of groups that's a big perk. PM if you want a badass leveling squad
---
A funeral is generally not held in a fucking video game is it? Stop. Go outside.
---
male ud, troll, orc all great in different ways imo.
---
Don’t do this. I’m not sure what’s optimal, but when I leveled shaman I always went for consistency when being enhance. I did 1h shield, and I liked to prioritize intellect stam and str. It was very consistent with a proper rotation and was easy to predict how many mobs you can go through. 
---
I always respec elemental at 40 and grab a couple dreamweave pieces, and usually have some decent intellect and stam from how I geared myself to that point. I’ll also look for some good priced natures wrath gear and snag that. This is a good idea on a pvp server and take the elemental mastery talent Bc u won’t see nature’s swiftness until 60 anyways. It’s a monster ability in that level range for pvp. Then ask every mage in sight if u can buy water whenever you log in (many say yes) and lightning bolt spam ur way to 60. 
---
Trust me, this is a ton of fun. And don’t even think about ironfoe for shaman. Hand of edward is very nice in pvp and can create fun scenarios. I love chasing running druids with it while I try to keep up with timely frost shocks and earthbinds. Slap a wind fury on it and you’ll get procs. This shit has a pretty high proc rate and is pretty useful against warlocks (toughest match up) when you’re trying to avoid being locked out of nature spells and the felhunter already ate ur grounding. It’s also fun to use when farming dm lashers/herbs. 
---
It’s really funny when you get the procs which lead to a quick kill and that guy takes a few seconds to release. I’ve had some insane combos.
---
Apathy towards the streamer. Why would I want to see daily conversations about something I don't care about?
---
Front load is good: Lightning shield&gt;Searing totem&gt; stoneskin/strength earth&gt; maybe healing stream if multi pull&gt; RB for more consistent damage over WF&gt; maybe flame shock if a few levels above you
---
You wont need to much spirit really if you don't shock often and use bandages to heal. I found agility works better than strength to increase crit/dodge which synergies well with flurry.
---
Going Elemental at 40-42 makes healing dungeons a lot easier since you already have +int/stam/spirit gear and just keep a +healing set in the bank to switch in to.
---
Forget about having Ironfoe and Hand of Edward. Very low droop chance compounded with them going to melee classes means you have a extremely small chance of acquiring them.
---
Sounds like the Ele/Resto Shaman. Priest would also work.
---
&gt;...or just saying f’ it and rolling a warrior to be an off-tank.
---
No one can help you if you can't at least narrow things down! :)
---
game difficulty is on hardcore and you cant change it. So if you die you will not respawn.
---
Idk this expansion is almost universally hated. Surely blizzard themselves are aware of that, if they don’t want an even larger exodus. They NEED to get classic out pre August
---
Ehh, I think the damage was done in Wrath with easymode everything. Suddenly the subscriber count flattened. 
---
Cata was the nail in the coffin though, for sure.
---
People bring you to raids for your utility, not your DPS. That said, yeah they do kinda fall off in damage sadly due to scaling issues. You'll definitely get a slot though. Hunter utility is excellent.
---
Introducing TBC means level 70, new races, new abilities, etc.. that’s literally a shit load of changes for a no changes fan like yourself.
---
If starting fresh solved the problem you wouldn’t see a decline of players...
---
The type of people you are talking about is a small portion of the community
---
Take your own advice
---
It’s the true love of your original character. You want to play something different, but that itch comes back.
---
Yeah but there’s almost always someone willing to do it because there’s other quests in that area that everyone does. I just know sometimes the stars just don’t allign when ur lfg wc and you just wanna move on and do something so you continue leveling. I know warlocks can also for sure solo it since fear is op for elite quests.
---
It’s this simple no logic not. Enhanced experience\= classic experience 
---
Can you comprendo that?
---
The grasslands and desserts are off. Litterally unplayable.
---
came here for this comment
---
Its not a min-max thing though, back then it was just common knowledge that those specs underperformed.
---
You can find a guild that dont care but it doesnt change the specs were bad for dmg (and prot pally bad for tanking cuz crushing blows)
---
Ehm you can't tank or heal as 29/11/11. Unless you're doing like BRD with a good group maybe...29/11/11 is nothing but a wpvp spec. And it's sh\*t if you have any less than 200 spell power. Hotw for first 2 phases all the way. 29/11/11 is in no way viable for a fresh 60, unless you want to be a meme and just have fun ofc, then any spec is possible.
---
Doesn’t really matter if it’s hated they are still unfortunately going to prioritize its content, no more people will leave than those who already have, there won’t be another mass exodus unless they announce something super stupid.
---
Ive been waiting 7 years for the next book.. winds of winter was it? Been so long i cant even remember..
---
It was pretty easy to wallwalk into. Tree was still there but there were still a lot of missing assets.
---
Caverns of Time had a path to wall walk as well, and had even more missing assets, pretty much everything bare except for the tower and the skybox of stars and wispy cloud threads
---
Yep, got an expert demonstration on how to present opinion as fact, opinion tweet dissecting 101,  And French military doctrine, how to retreat and try to hold your head up. 
---
You can close the door behind you when you leave.
---
The optimal PVP spec is actually 30/0/21 Ele/Resto hybrid, so you'll be throwing nukes while healing. It's a very engaging spec and is pretty powerful especially later in the progression. 
---
Warlocks are insane later on once caster gear starts getting really powerful. A well geared warlock destroys people.
---
I guess it depends on the role you really want to fill. Gearing an ele/resto is a little harder due to competition for OS stuff and the fact that there are 7 other shamans in your raid to contend with for gear. Once you get the gear though it's great.
---
Warlock will probably have an easier time gearing since caster DPS stuff is MS for them.
---
2-3 hours per evening consistently should be perfectly fine if you spend your time in game somewhat efficiently.

The thing is if you want to play tank in raids you will almost certainly have to out-compete other warriors for those spots (they are usually very sought after), and that involves putting a lot of effort into the game. If you can get in a guild early and establish connections with other guild members you have an advantage, but depending on how "serious" the guild is someone could still come along and take your spot if you are slacking. 
---
How much exactly is required of you obviously depends on the ambitions of the guild you are in. In a somewhat casual guild they will probably not really care as long as you are a nice guy and not holding them back (this is starting to sound like advice for getting a job, but social connections are key). In a hardcore raiding guild they would bench you if someone else could step up and do a better job than you. 
---
Speaking as an officer in a semi-hardcore raiding guild on retail (I know, I know, but I think it's still comparable). Especially for tanks, just always showing up for raids is your best quality, and we would always pick the tank that shows up for raids every time over someone who misses raids here and there but plays a little bit better. 
---
If you are willing to play DPS in raids, only tanking dungeons and being an off-tank in raids it's a lot easier.
---
I'm probably going to roll warlock in classic, thoughts? what am i in for? Can they PVP? Are they good in PVE?
---
I quit playing WoW and came back late WoD. I leveled and then legion hit. I could not do legion content at all. I got insta killed and corpse camped. All the time 24/7. Not just one annoying corpse camp I mean literally all the time. I was unable to play the game.
---
Then i did some googling and i found out that LESS than 1%!!! of max level players on my server are alliance.
---
How the fuck is that ok? Yes I like Pvp but in order for it beeing somewhat healthy it has to be at least kind of balanced. I quit the game over this since I did not accept that I have to pay money to change a fuck up of blizzard.
---
Legion was literally unplayable for me and my friend and that was really sad. I am not exxagerating.
---
Servers need to be force balanced in some way or another.
---
MT Warriors have the most pre-raid prep by far. 
---
For one, their gearing determines when oyu cn start raiding. The rest of the raid can be in questing greens, but if your MT is in BiS, you can roll into MC. So the amount of dungeon runs you need to do is higher than every other class.
---
Tanks also have the highest consumalbe requirement. Everyone should be an Engineer, but for tanks its nearly mandatory. You'll also need a ton of pots, elixers and flasks because you are the most impcful player in the raid and everything you use is simply more valuable than others.
---
On the bright side, once you do all of that, you reap the benefits of being the MT, so gear is rightully gifted to you all the time. Also, even if you're not an officer, you have a default leadership position because of how significant your role is.
---
As for least prep time, it's probably healers. They really don't need to be engineers and while they'll suck down mana pots like crazy, good tanks and good DPS will have a higher cost on consumables.
---
Wrath was literally the height of sub numbers, blizzard stock was sky high and they sold that year to activision.
---
Wrath was wildly popular and one of the last times they publicly reported their subscriber numbers.
---
When cata hit it destroyed all the old world quests, talents and introduced LFR, transmog and guild overhauls.
---
Fuck cata with a ten foot dick it is the root of all evil.
---
Holy/Reckoning build with Hand of Edward the Odd = immortality vs Rogues.
---
But those changes aren't changes from the way the game was run. Once Vanilla was done, it went to TBC. If the classic server goes to TBC at some point, how exactly is that a change? O.o
---
Don't worry horde scum, I have my /spit x5 macro at the ready
---
&gt; They recruited a ton of casual players and offered them what amounted to dkp for herbs/consumables and other mats. The ever couple of weeks we brought the ones that had enough points in to MC or BWL eventually ZG and let them take whatever epics weren’t needed by main raiders which since it was usually the tier behind was a lot of them. They got geared up and we always had plenty of consumables for raids without really having to buy them ourselves.
---
I love how unfair that is if you think about it. Those "casual" players could potentially spend more time on the game than your raiders and still get the short end of the stick. 
---
Interesting idea though, I had not thought about that before.
---
I have to admit there are quite a few zones I forgot, I think it’s time try out some private servers for a refresher
---
Oh and make sure your pet taunts aggro from the tank.
---
They are giving it a pep talk before pushing it away
---
You were lightning fast on this one, thank you!
---
While all that's true, we'll never know if in a world where Wrath was just as brutal as TBC, that sub count wouldn't have kept growing. One can dream. 
---
But yes - fuck Cata in the eye.
---
This is projection. You, like many others, chose not to min-max. That doesn't speak for the entire community.
---
This will happen on RP-PvP servers too (and is actually the main reason why RP population of RP-PvP servers migrated to normal RP servers).
---
Of course, they should be available at launch, but those people won´t magically disappear just because it will have "RP" in name.
---
Classic is defined as vanilla.
---
vanilla means the game before its first expansion..
---
No, but most private server tryhards are from EU, and those can do more harm than a streamer imo. If you end up on the opposite faction of them, expect your life to be miserable.
---
See it this way, after tying the record for regular season wins, they are now the first team to exit in the 1st round after winning the president trophy. 2 records, 1 season. You should be proud!
---
Warlock, Hunter or Mage :O PvP and PvE
---
I like the idea of Hunter first but they fall off late :(
---
I can't seem to find the unsubscribe button either.
---
how important is improved mana burn?
---
Less. Guilds are also more likely to band together to shun those that disturb the community.
---
Overwatched was released early summer.
---
I really really hope so. I've been playing FFXIV to fill in the gap until whatever the release date is, and I'm having a great time - but I'm still going to drop FFXIV as soon as Classic launches.
---
Yes, and then a Dream of Spring.
---
I dislike cross realm anything because it hurts server community.  It used to mean something when you faced off against people on YOUR server.
---
Analyzing logic....
---
!!!!!
---
Anomaly found!
---
Joking aside I agree with what you say, I made a mistake with my OP I’m supporting the stance on enhancing classic WoW
---
I still don't get it lol.
---
Haha, knew it. When you realize you're wrong, you devolve into this petty 10-year old style "no you" argument level. You've done it a couple times in this thread already. If trolling is what you're trying to achieve, you need to step up your game a little bit. Relax, it's going to be ok. /pat
---
Yeah, guess what, you can have - wait for it - other servers! Where you transfer characters if you want! TBC does not mean every Vanilla server is automatically upgraded. 
---
Decline of players where? Retail? That isn't starting fresh, that's a new expansion. In privates? What decline? They're literally more popular than ever before because there's so many of them.
---
Based my choice on WC3. Come to think of it, a big portion of Vanilla players were very different from current retail players, because they came from WC3, and weren't just generic online gamers that followed whatever online game was popular.
---
Anyway I based my Orc Shaman on Thrall. Am still kinda pissed that they didn't use the same sound effect for Chain Heal as the Shadow Hunter in WC3, and even worse they just reused the same sound effect as for Chain Lighting! Prior to rolling Shaman, I rolled an Orc Warrior, and based that on the Blademaster.
---
I wouldn’t be so sure about raiding, the guild I am planning to run with as well as several others I’ve seen on the recruitment thread are planning on just 2 nights a week usually weekends.
---
Classic WoW is harder than retail, but we also know a lot more now than we did then. It’s not going to be like the old days where you get lost in Stone Talon mountains for 4 hours looking for a damn quest npc only to find out that he is actually in the Desolace and people in chat are morons.
---
It will still take time, but most of what I’ve been researching indicates about 4-10 days /played is average for getting to 60 with modern information resources and a bit of focus.
---
I am stuck between Lock and Priest. So I am curious as well.
---
right, but if its going to go through all the xpacks, it's not really a change from what it was in the past. People have been bringing up what they want or think should happen once Naxx is out and on farm. It could go the way of TBC, they could just leave the servers as is, they could create more content. As of right now, a lot people want the launch to be no changes. Once Naxx is on farm, we can address what things may be needed from there. It should be an authentic experience at least up until Naxx. Luckily, that is going to be years down the road and doesn't really need to be discussed right now.
---
You are correct. But you are missing the fact that players will likely be competing for raid spots. It doesn't matter if you need things or not, anyone who does a "better" job in raids, if it's due to consumables or skill, will have a much easier time getting a spot. And with how vanilla gameplay works, you can't really "outplay" most players, so consumables are kind of important.
---
R E C O R D B R E A K E R S
---
Sure, specs bad. But not unplayable. If you choose to play a bad spec, that's on you. Maybe feel a little bad for the newbies who don't know what they're getting into, sure, but it's not worth rebalancing the entire game into something it never was. Rebalanced specs means changes to loot tables and totally new loot, changes to raid, buff, debuff composition, who runs what dungeon how often, all of it. It's a dangerous domino effect.
---
I think the same applies here
---
That blizzard stock comment is so disingenuous.  ATVI is so much more than just WoW
---
im excited for classic. but lets be honest that doesn't make it "harder" just more time consuming like he said.
---
Reminds me of [this old classic.](https://i.imgur.com/6D8aBmb.jpg)
---
Never played WoW?
---
If you want a challenging, fun and rewarding game: play classic!!
---
If you want to play dogshit: don’t even play current version of WoW it’s utter shit
---
It would be great to have it announced on my cake day!
---
I honestly don’t know, there were about 20-30 of them usually at any given time, I think in most of their cases they were intimidated by raiding and didn’t want to have to have to take any kind of responsibility for playing well.
---
We would carry 15-20 of them through MC in about 2 hours once we had BWL mostly on farm. They epics and to see the raid without having to worry about staying alive or doing anything beyond showing up on the day we scheduled the run.
---
Go play on your private server kiddo
---
Honestly, I preferred the Horde version. Longer due to travel time, but no putting up with walk-speed escort quests and going in &amp; out of BRD multiple times.
---
LOL, wrong I’ve never been more right.
---
Go cut your grass.
---
Too much RNG!
---
How much DPS do warriors do at similar gear level?
---
Literally been refreshing on my day off today waiting for a new fix - thanks for all the work you do and its really been interesting to see how the show has evolved over time. You spend so much time thanking everyone else for their contributions but the show wouldn't be the same without your wit and delivery.
---
"Hey i know there's probably tons of previous posts already about this and Google is full of guides aswell but lemme just make a post about this anyway mmkay"
---
Thats what the fuck is wrong bitch, fucking learn how to search.
---
I’m rolling shadow, so I’ll never heal even when it’s needed and I’ll also roll on all caster loot no exceptions, especially the spell crit pieces. Count me in
---
Wool? Nah, Mageweave.
---
Just know you are in a classic wow subreddit, answers here are going to be pretty biased in one direction.
---
I'm going to attempt to give you the unbaised view. If you like classic RPG elements, interesting gear, and open world play go for classic. If you like streamlined fluid combat, straightforward consistent ARPG-ish upgrades, and overall more casual play experience then I would go with retail. 
---
They are really entirely different games.
---
Are you retarded? These are just your standard regular raid consumes that every DPS worth their salt will be using.
---
Guess it's basically like selling boosts (which people do a lot at least on retail, and probably will on classic too), but instead of announcing it to randoms you keep it more inclusive by doing it for guildies, which is kind of nice.
---
Playing Retail is like playing a game on Easy mode.
---
Playing Classic is like playing it on Normal, but being able to skip anything that gives you trouble.
---
It´s definitely more difficult, but nothing hardcore (talking about world content, obviously).
---
Whats the difference between normal PVP and RP PVP servers? What settings are different that make this setver type so good?
---
Home sweet home
---
I've always leveled in Kalimdor mostly because I always chose Horde. This time I'll level in Eastern Kingdoms! Beautiful locations.
---
Ah, I forgot about our cow friends. I enjoy female Tauren cast animations a lot, so they never bother me. I’ll need to check out female orcs, because I was so certain they only had 1.
---
100% agree. All these #nochanges people in here can fuck off. There are already so many changes. Especially if it's a client side option, who cares?
---
How much does hunter dps fall off affect them in pvp? Like once warlocks get T2.5, will hunters still be as good in premades and the like?
---
That lag indicator!
---
Paladin with reckoning but honestly restobear druids are far superior with thorns on. You can also return the favor on them if they gank you then start grinding you can pounce them and it applies bleed. No vanish.
---
Refresh my memory so I can add travels spots please.
---
Alliance: 
---
Darkshore - Wetlands
---
Horde:
---
Tirisfal Glades - Durotar
---
Neutral:
---
Stranglethorn Vale - Barrens
---
Personally I hope they release it the day all the kids go back to school after the summer holidays. I don’t want those twerps being ahead of me 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Hey, I was in Onslaught, will have to check this out. Who did you have from the guild?
---
I dont disagree. I just have a hard time believing that the scenario literally was "random people running through ironforge, sees your gear and tells you to kill yourself".   
---
No dialogue? No interaction? Absolutely no context?
---
Yuuuup. Had a dwarf hunter as my first ever character. But then I came to my senses and went horde with Tauren Shaman
---
I listen to this while I'm on the toilet
---
But what if 500 of those who disturb the community come?
---
As I said, this happened on RP-PvP servers on Retail. Slowly but surely, more players who weren´t interrested in RP (but were definitely interrested in disturbing it) came and, unfortunately, RP is one of those things that can be really easily destroyed when people are allowed to kill you.
---
I hope you are right, but my prediction is that RPers will be extreme minority on Classic RP-PvP servers and may end up abandoning the server.
---
Release Date is AFK
---
&gt; Maybe feel a little bad for the newbies who don't know what they're getting into
---
Thats my point. A lot of players will come from any newer WoW expansion and try out the vanilla version for the first time. 
---
Its going to be a lot of "thats on you" and ppl who maybe loved playing ret pally in wrath will be dissapointed and leave.
---
Guess we will see ofc, but its one of the few arguments i support for change.
---
 ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ Summon release date ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ
---
I'm glad I realized this on a dwarf then, I don't think I could handle that amount of forbidden knowledge.
---
Go paladin. They are auto attack heroes but are way easier on the fingers. Druid spam claw all the way to 60. Most mobs die before you can bleed finish so it sucks ass. I have played both to 60 in last 2 years. Pallys are great at farming the saytrs in felwood at 60 for demonic runes for raiding and mana. Can pull a dozen and aoe with holy wrath
---
Is RFD a joke to you?
---
Are they level 60? Then they are geared enough to start MC.
---
&gt;If it was possible back then people would have figured it out real quick.
---
Would they though.. I'm not saying it was possible, but honestly consider how bad people were in vanilla and how little people actually discovered about the game, I wouldn't be surprised if it actually was possible.
---
I picked rogue from reading the game manual while it was installing, picked the night elf race because of the trailer tho. What’s up with no rogue featured in cinematic?
---
I'm also torn on lock or Hunter. They both are fun for me up to level 20 when I tested. One thing I need to decide on is soul shards vs ammo/feeding. I love the long range of hunters but locks have a great variety of sustain
---
Thats why you bring an enhance or ret with you ;-). They deserve to feel important, sometimes.
---
Aww that's me :(
---
Yeh this does give me lots of worries. Thanks mate
---
I haven't played much in any of the recent expansions. Are you joking or does that crap actually happen in retail?
---
If the streamer quits the game, their fanbase will likely follow them and the server population will drop by quite a bit.
---
If you think not being 60 by the end of week 1 has any potential to keep you from playing the game/keeping up, unsubscribe from this subreddit and ignore these people.
---
And school teachers! Can't have them school teachers getting ahead of the rest of us either!
---
HAHAHA this was a funny conversation because we both meant the opposite I meant. 
---
Enhance experience \= NOT EQUAL to classic experience (original , vanilla)
---
I guess. In the same sense that Dark Souls isn't hard as long as you're careful and slow.
---
Idk about ret pally because I don't play alliance but on horde side pretty much every class and most specs are raid viable or even optimal.
---
Feral Druid is a good example of this. They can tank/offtank in the majority of encounters and are decent at off-healing/decursing/dispelling poisons in healing intensive fights, their DPS is higher than the one of the prot warrior when not tanking.
---
Enhance shamans are brought by some hardcore guilds to buff up their tanks/warriors with totems and their casters with nightfall. They can also off-heal decently well if they have their mandatory 20 (or 21) points in resto.
---
Shadowpriests are brought at the latest with AQ/Naxx (where optimizing actually starts to matter), to increase raid dps. And they can off-heal in fights that need them to.
---
Ele shamans / balance druids can keep up with DPS in short fights and can off-heal well in heal intensive fights.
---
Basically on horde all of the off-specs are raid viable if utilized correctly. You obviously don't want to stack your raids with hybrids but they all provide flexibility and unique strengths that at least make up for their lack of specialized power or even increase the raid strength over not bringing them.
---
I'm sorry, I just need to confirm.. You do realize that 1.12 is the final patch version of vanilla and that AQ release was PRIOR to 1.12? 1.12 had the blessing duration that you are mentioning.
---
It's not unheard of that preraid warlocks and mages struggle to break 400 dps.
---
Exactly, we got a few raid recruits out of the process over the life of Vanilla once people saw that raiding wasn’t as scary as it seemed and in most cases they already had some pretty decent gear because they had been riding the consumables gravy train for awhile.
---
Once they saw that stepping in to a raid didn’t mean you had to immediately become Neo, some of them jumped the fence to the raider side.
---
It was a pretty good system, but I don’t know if it would work today. Not enough people playing MMOs anymore to have a guild with 50 or so raiders and another 30 or so other members.
---
My guess is the release date will be August 6th. July 16th doesn't seem likely at this point, and my gut is telling me the game will come out August 6th since it is the first Tuesday in August.
---
lol you angry fuck, I told you to sit down
---
Be sure to pay back the Alliance by taking over South Shore.
---
Alliance have been a plague upon Hillsbrad Foothills and I'd like to see some ice cold Justic.
---
You'll be able to join PUG raids casually, specifically ZG and AQ20, you might also get into the odd MC and BWL pug but that will only be later in the cycle when those raids are on farm. You'll lnever see Naxx playing casually though.
---
I have around 25 days /played at 60 atm, and it's honestly not as bad as people make it out to be. 99.9% raids don't expect you to make healthstones for every single person, so that's not really a thing outside of the absolute most hardcore 0.1% of guilds.
---
And the shards you use for other stuff you get from trash in dungeons or raids.
---
As long as you don't show up for a raid with *zero* shards you're good. And even then you'll get what you need from trash as I said. Most of the time there'll be 2 or 3 other locks who can summon if it's absolutely needed.
---
Yes
---
I'm actually very surprised to learn that they may not have this realm type.
---
I was planning on rolling RP-PvP and assumed there were plenty of players to support that server option. I thought it was a given that they would have this. =(
---
Fkn nice, OP! I use animated wallpapers to fit the theme of a world I'm currently in (say Game of Thrones, World of Wacraft, BioShock). It's like the only reason I still use the desktop. I wish there is something similar for Android.
---
Never played dark souls cannot comment. The average skill level is obscenely high compared to vanilla I honestly expect no challenges
---
That is unrealistic, not only are you splitting the player base which is a huge detriment to the game, blud will have to spend more money on servers and then likely have to split up staff or hire more people.
---
If you’ve been following, that’s a lot of resources to be allocated. 
---
Also what about the decline of subscriptions when there is no more content to go through? It happens believe it or not and it will happen again. Don’t be delusional.
---
&gt; Furthermore turning into tbc just contradicted your no changes...
---
Are you really equating releasing an expansion pack to changing core functionality within the Classic game?
---
There was a 15 (or maybe 30?) minute cooldown on it.
---
I really want to get ready for wow classic for when it comes out, but I have never played wow. Are there some private servers I should try out or something? Any recommendations?
---
I'm game. If I get bored, I'll go DPS bear in full spirit cloth, since spirit increases rage generation. I'll just run right in without warning, really catch all the mobs off guard.
---
Can’t bubble hearth if you’re falling into lava outside BRD
---
‘Chill it’s just a game’ when people /w you complaining
---
Undead warlock looking for shaman or priest or druid buddy to get some very good synergy going while leveling. Always want someone to watch your back in this game if you're a healer main? Don't worry. PM ME and we shall dominate.
---
I'am personally for adding new content that was left out, like Undermine etc. If they are added after Naxx.
---
But I'am against balance changes except if they are actually gameplay fixes for abilities that were supposed to work differently.
---
The main problem with WoW balancing was always that Blizzard listened too much to community whining, which lead to heavily streamlining the classes and specs instead of keeping unique strengths and weaknesses. Not everything needs to do the same damage, have the same amount of early-lategame power, have the same amount of mobility etc.
---
The average player doesn't understand game balance. Their scope is: "This seems weak in the situations I'am using it compared to this other thing, so you need to change it to be equal." That is a terribly shortsighted perspective on game balance and design in general.
---
&gt; Feral Druid is a good example of this. They can tank/offtank in the majority of encounters and are decent at off-healing/decursing/dispelling poisons in healing intensive fights, their DPS is higher than the one of the prot warrior when not tanking.
---
Yea this was true, Feral Druids was good for offtanks :)
---
If we are talking about settings, so actual technicalities and not the community who may engage in RP, making the word feel more alive, the only thing is that there is a naming policy, not allowing names that consist of actual words for instance.
---
&gt; simply by having the player base vote for new changes
---
This already happened to retail.  People complaining about features until stuff changed, and the game changed for the worse.
---
DM me, I'm interested!
---
I mean it's 3 ubrs for the horde one and lbrs then 3 world dragons lol sounds like cancer compared to 2 brds then ubrs
---
Go with Hunter if that's where you're leaning. They bring utility to a raid and really shine on some longer fights because they can feign death and drink. It's true you won't top meters, but you also won't be expected to. They're also great in PvP. If you get the chance, tune in to the Countdown to Classic podcast. A few months back, Nineteen27, a hunter from Death and Taxes during Vanilla, did a great interview. It should give you a good idea of what will be in store for you.
---
Saved for reference, ty.
---
Retail Mythics are much much harder mechanics wise..
---
It sucks when that happens and unfortunately those players cannot be  forcibly removed from the realm. Again, as a community we will have to persevere and not give these players a chance to establish a foothold on the realm. This will be considerably easier on an actual RP-PvP realm than on an ordinary PvP realm. Hence why we want one!
---
Oh wow you are so smart you buttface.
---
and mages
---
Not to mention then you have to do test of skulls which is straight cancer.
---
This is really amazing. I loved the first one.
---
I will personally make a character on whatever realm you're playing on and get a character to 60 and help you through any low level content if this is true.
---
I dont think wow gives a fuck what ffxiv does lol
---
Its going to be a bit weird to have the plaguelands be high level zones again.  Well, actually i'd say its weird to have them be lower level ones now.  It'll be nice to have them be more 'end game' with Classic.
---
There are soooo few things to do in azshara if you weren't a chinese gold farmer.
---
Started playing right before TBC so never got to experience vanilla raiding/being 60. When classic rolls around my goal is end game raiding. 
---
Mained a Moonkin druid and loved it.  DPS druids aren't viable in raids and I'd like to still range DPS so I'm between Mage or Warlock. Which is better for a beginner raider?
---
It should be possible. I doubt they remodel the world. They will just take the terrain from back then so these areas will once again be unfinished. But because of the new server you may need to find a new way inside the areas. That shouldn't be a problem i guess
---
Where is Razor Fen Downs left out?
---
You should change Burning Steppes to 15; 50-58. Anybody who’s anybody in Classic always took the path north out or Redridge into BS the first time they saw it because, “oh look a path!”... and then immediately died to Flamekins.
---
Don’t pretend that’s not how you first discovered Burning Steppes.
---
Paladins?
---
All I know is STVietnam
---
I lol'd. If it weren't for pally buffing, I'd totally join you.
---
i sort of dot farmed as a lock, wish we had seed of corruption in vanilla 
---
issue is unlike mage the mobs are not slowed so you are being hit while you rain of fire.
---
i feel like mage was the only true aoe class back then
---
one thing to know is that in vanilla you won't be able to level in one zone from start to finish without a lot of rested experience. So going 10-20 will require you to step into a 15-25 zone for a few levels. You'll be jumping back and forth like this until 60.
---
The one that will show up consistently. Ya’ll are super duper underestimating what it means to have FORTY (40) people show up. The super elite guilds will have their full enchants/pots/world buffs. The casuals will be fortunate to get all 40 people without pugging.
---
Yeah, they would have. Vanilla wow players being horrible is a bit of a meme as well. Sure, no one knew what the hell they were doing at the beginning when stuff like MC/ony was current content and there wasn't any information available online, but by 2006 theorycrafting websites were well-established and game knowledge in general was pretty high. 
---
It doesn't take any advanced knowledge and math to figure out that wiggling around like a maniac could sometimes let you backstab a mob. As if every single rogue or druid in all of vanilla never attempted to do that, or at the very least saw that it happened accidentally and tried to recreate it? 
---
People didn't have access to as much technical knowledge back then but they weren't idiots.
---
Already addressed the trinket concern. Thinking back I don't think I had any PvP gear on my warlock. It was always raid gear. 2 pew pew trinkets if I recall correctly I had the ToEP and ToA only because I never got Hakkar's heart nor NT. I don't think I started using trinkets until Wrath but that was on my priest.
---
I never really had too much of a problem with rogues back in Vanilla. Of course, I made sure to not spam DC while a stun was wearing off after being hit with a shadow reflector once.  ONCE. After that I learned to eat the opener, spam the healthstone instead and wait until the stun wears off looking for that SR trinket animation. If it didn't go off it was go time. I'd (near) insta summon the void for the extra 10% to Soul Link to soak melee damage and start baiting waiting for the vanish before popping off with CDs on the 2nd round. Gear + SL you'd live through quite a bit. I won most battles against rogues, paranoia works wonders but I've seen it miss a few times, I don't remember if it was based on facing direction it's been so long since I've played I just remember dotting rogues while stealthed coming towards me, so that's my experience. Now if we are talking --
---
Warriors being immune to fear for several seconds was probably about it that was almost a guaranteed death for me. There's not much you could do to keep them off unless you were able to open with a seduce nuke but equal gear and skill if you both see each other coming I'd always pucker up that little bit.
---
I'll do it again, though I don't know if I want to focus on more PvP gear this time or stick with raiding. I do prefer the gear from raiding, personally.
---
tier zoo should use this map in his videos.
---
Two of the three Horde characters I attuned for it being Rogues didn't hurt, since I had to grind UBRS to gear them up anyway. And running around the world for the 3 dragons was nice lore-wise, made the quest seem like it had far-reaching ramifications for what you were doing.
---
Yes, Human Mage.
---
Female Tauren... yikes
---
Don't move during a summon, it keeps failing.
---
Locks, paladins, boomkins.
---
They really need to up the respawn rates this is bullshit!
---
Just mages... 
---
Paladins, locks and holy priests can aoe farm, but nowhere near as efficiently as mages
---
I didn't look super hard, but do they post a transcript of their shows so I can read them?
---
Shamans really can't aoe farm. I mean, they kind of can, but not really.
---
Totems are party wide and have a AoE range. Your party members need to be within range of the totems.
---
You can only have 1 active totem per type (of 4 types).
---
Weapon buff totems like Flametongue and Windfury apply a weapon buff for 9s if not overriden by personal weapon buffs (sharpening etc.). So you can actually apply Windfury and then switch to Grave of Air right after to keep up these two buffs at the same time despite them both being air totems if you do that every 9s.
---
Warriors always profit more from Windfury than from Grace of Air. Sword Rogues are about the same for both, Dagger Rogues profit more from agility than Winfury. Hunters and Druids don't profit from Windfury but very much from agility.
---
Some totems have repeated actions, like dispelling poisons, fear (Tremor) etc. These totems have an inner cooldown or rather tick to so say where the dispell happens every X seconds (i think it is 2s).
---
&gt; down the road say 5+ years into Classic.
---
We have TBC and Wrath.  The model is in place.  
---
To keep the Classic people happy, just release fresh Classic servers when TBC launches, then Classic and TBC servers when Wrath launches.  This way people get to play whatever version they like while people who want to progress their characters further can do so.
---
Plenty of guilds will want to relive the game by playing a different faction and/or changing up the roles they play in a raid.
---
I think that I am going to be playing a shaman, but then between going ele/resto or just 2h memefury
---
Absolutely fkin genius idea!!!!!! Thank u!!!! I’m gonna do this! 😂
---
\&gt; The second we start to substitute our modern judgement to solve problems from 12 years ago we are deviating from our goal of a historical recreation of the game as it was, and making something different, and that is something we want to avoid .

I am interested in being an undead warlock. Looking for pvp as well as weekly content clears without too much sweating. I am vanilla vet just looking for people to level with and watch each others back.  Raiding 8-12 eastern would be perfect. Can always raid minimum of 3 hours.
---
Just mages. Paladin only has one are and retribution aura, which is like 120/16dps respectively. You will die if you pull 3-4 mobs and try to fight them. You need three frost spec for purma freeze.  You can frost kite with Hunter, but not many mobs at a time.

Easy there, heavy metal dick.
---
Starter zone should be 1-12, as if you do all the quests available, without grouping (except for a select few) you will be level 12 before entering the next zone, and you should avoid going to the next zone until level 12, or else you are gonna have a bad time.
---
I can relate. I had a night elf druid for my first character and I hated the night elf casting animations. Mr. Noggenfogger made a killing off of me just so I could raid as a skeleton.
---
Prot pally can farm a lot.
---
Nice, some really good insight there, thank you
---
Didn't even know feign death and drink was a thing
---
Lol that’s so ironic but now it’s clear you’re my enemy
---
Vanilla = spirit
---
Enhanced vanilla = enhanced spirit
---
So if we enhance vanilla it’ll still be vanilla with small tweaks that will make it more enjoyable
---
Ok I forgot about that, wasn't a big fan of it to begin with so I don't mind.
---
We used to say the same thing about Half-Life 2 Episode 3.
---
Please don't curse this!
---
&gt; people will quickly get bored 
---
If there is one thing that Private Servers have taught us it is that people will not quickly get bored of Vanilla.
---
Given Americas E pluribus unum, immigration, and united we stand type deal the horde fits them perfectly.
---
I would just say logic.
---
Nope, go in blind.
---
Feral will have to do 5 times the amount of work to match an equally geared rogue
---
Its easier to just bring a resto shaman and not kneecap your dps.
---
Job easily done by a holy priest.
---
Ele prob viable but same as feral has to put in overtime.
---
Balance does shit dps and runs out of mana because you aren't allowed to innervate yourself.
---
Not to mention all good gear will go to the better classes first.
---
Is it possible to raid with them? Sure, in that way they are viable. But you are intentionally handicapping your guild because you wanna be a special snowflake.
---
Undead warlock main with pvp focus. I think my plan is to get engineering mining to max, then when the tailoring bloodline set comes out drop mining and get tailoring because warlocks need hit% gear. Can anyone think of a greater combo than engineering/tailor for a warlock? I cannot.
---
Desla?
---
We're already going to have retail players touring classic. No need to add fuel to the fire.
---
Fei, Cleabis and mystery guest
---
Sshhhhhink
---
Mage is better for beginner
---
Ok in that case then you guys should have no problem if blizzard buffed ret paladins do they can be competent in raids (doesn’t have to be just as strong as a warrior, but strong enough where they can be used in minmax raids.
---
Cool! Sounds good!
---
Four dragons Lol everyone forgets about the red dragon in wetlands.
---
Yea I know how bres works, I'm just not getting the meme I guess.
---
dwarf hunter represent!
---
No, i loved Scholomance, it was imo the best dungeon to enter, so much stuff to look at :)
---
I hated male Night Elf animations for a long time, but Swifty kinda got me to like them. I actually now think that male Night Elf Warriors and Rogues look pretty sweet.
---
Lmao you don't remember vanilla chat? It was shit then, just different shit
---
Yeah I understand that! I mind raiding Naxx pre expansions and it was a tough grind for mats and consumables! But I had no job and kids back then.
---
Would actually just be happy with a good guild and 5-15 mans as I level. And UBRS, MC and maybe ZG much later. 
---
Loved AV weekends, doing the healing on my Shammy. Great fun just questing. Fav area was The pirate quests in Tanaris. Loved that.
---
its that druids are trash because they can't res after a wipe
---
Ya dwarf hunter until my friends laughed at me and I rerolled a human warlock.
---
Not with sharding in Classic WoW, he doesn’t.
---
Yeah, it's just supply and demand. Same for a person who is one of FOUR people on a brand new server who has learned Crusader or Spellpower. Want that enchant? Providing the materials? It's still 150g as a service fee, because supply and demand.   
---
Damage classes are rewarding for how much power they allow one to wield over both the environment and hostile players, but one of the costs of over-supplying that role is a lower demand for it.   
---
I'm not going to try reserving anything among my fellow guild members, but if I need literally only one item out of a dungeon I've nearly exhausted the potential of, why PuG it and risk getting out-rolled when you can simply ASK public chat if they'd be down to do that zone with the exception being that you're only after one thing, and to simply ignore it and carry on if it's a make or break situation for them?
---
Correct. The only raid wide things in vanilla are buffs like fortitude, mark of the wild, arcane int or paladin blessings
---
Check out r/wowservers

Technically it’s a winter 2019 release for some countries down under

KT extinction was the sundering my dude, cataclysm comes when climate change makes Day After Tomorrow shit start popping off

Nice try you satanist
---
Yup it was standard, but with bestial wrath? I always felt the “rare” elite mobs did more damage....I was probably imagining it, but it just felt that way. 😂
---
Just go human and stock up on noggen fogger, best of both worlds, or go something else and use deviate delight for human form
---
chances? 0%

Looks like they have a migraine

&gt; Retail is a good MMO for casuals who like building up a virtual character and collecting stuff (gear, mounts, pets, etc.) and whatever else they do. And it's a good game if you like very challenging group based action-RPG type content (dungeons and raids) that is continually updating and evolving.
---
I was one of those players but they took all the shine off the skinner box and made the grind even longer and more obvious for any sort of reward. I think they figured out a lot of people were like me and made the grinds longer in an attempt to keep us subbed longer but it massively backfired and had the opposite effect after talking to a number of players who liked collecting stuff like I did.  If I wanted to grind that long and do that much daily chores I could just do rl stuff for obviously way bigger rewards.
---
Don't.
---
No chance.  Retail will remain as casual friendly as possible
---
I personally go off of roleplaying even if I'm not on a rp realm. I want to enjoy \*being\* a character.
---
For example: Forsaken Warlock. I envision being someone who studies the effects of life essences. Soul trapping, life sapping, life siphoning, health funneling. All enabled by having his mortality taken from him. His demons are just easy access subjects and protectors as he works in the field.
---
Brilliant idea
---
I really hope that it's gonna be possible to do this in Classic because Blizzard's servers are garbage right now.  Just watch this video,this explains everything:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDXtut0fDmI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDXtut0fDmI)
---
Female orcs looks great in tier sets, like a tame version of the orc males stupidly large shoulder pads, also they stand up straight and don't have the ugly hunchback
---
There'll still be scaling in retail to come, but I suspect the loss of power (IE how you become extremely weak at 117) will be better. Nothing on the scale of Classic's leveling, unfortunately.
---
Great idea, involve the daughter and reduce wife aggro!!😂
---
Current retail players are trash in PvP. Logged into my twink 19 rogue after getting my account back and was #1 in kills on ally side. First time I played in 10+ years.  I can only assume its the same for PvE content. Less people have seen, played in, and beat Naxx vanilla then the number of people who currently farm the "harder" content. If the content is harder as you suggest it stands to reason that then less people would be able to complete it. Something doesn't add up....
---
Crazy eyes but nice boobs is a dangerous gamble many men have taken the risk on before.
---
Finally someone said it
---
In Tips Outs' parse ranking video, 4 weeks into MC, the average dps is this:
---
477.1 warriors, 429 rogue, 361.3 hunters, 359.6 mage, 264.7 locks
---
I don't know if this is boss only dps, or boss+trash or entire raid.
---
which would be hilarious
---
i dont know if this is boss only dps, or boss+thrash or raid wide
---
I try to avoid mentioning anything bad about level/gear scaling over there, as I get downvoted into oblivion.  Although.. huh, guess that happened here too.
---
I love the feel of RP-PVP servers, they honestly felt closer to the old wow i loved at a kid when i tried one in BFA. Im not sure i understand the justification in not having them for classic.
---
thanks for your input, I'm really interested in a hand of edward the odd battle-mage build.
---
Eastern and western plaguelands as well
---
However i believe casting a spell like arcane brilliance only applies to the 5 people in the targets party.
---
And you think there's no possibility in splitting the player base between people who don't want new vanilla content and those that do? Come on. 
---
They will have to deal with player decline regardless of what they choose to do. It's a complete inevitably.
---
I'm in the same position, I recommend you find a guild that will help you out and are friendly to new players, and just wait for classic instead of trying retail. That's what I'm doing anyway.
---
I will be on a PvP server so this will work out good for me since the mega big streamers will pretty much be forced to play PvE servers or else the will be camped 24/7
---
You don't wanna get used to quality of life/easy mode stuff in retail BfA or even the xpacs before. Current and classic wow are completely different games, but 2004 WoW is the original game that gave birth to a generation of mmo players aswell as giving a "permanent" home to older mmo players. Every xpac (especially the current one) is based on having almost all content at max level, which will probably ruin your leveling experience in classic a little if you become fixated and desperate to hit level 60.
---
Wait and enjoy yourself when Classic WoW comes out.
---
Would you say mages gets hard countered by warlocks? I always play casters in MMOs and am trying to decide between a mage or warlock. I love playing mobile casters, but I absolutely hate having hard counters and losing by default.
---
Also, I'm addicted to popping consumables and using anything that gives me an advantage. If mages do get hard countered by other classes, could the gap be closed by using buffs/trinkets/equip effects? I just want a fighting chance and not an auto loss.
---
Sorry for replying so late, but you seem knowledgable and I need an informed opinion.
---
Forget preraid bis for 2 weeks.  Farm 900g for your epic mount using whatever strategy suits you (devilsaur, brd pickpocket runs, pots, etc).  After your epic mount, level up engineering and your lockpicking.  I usually do mining, herbs at the start until i have saved enough mats to powerthrough engineeering.  Then i swap to herbs/engineering once i feel the need for more raid consumables.  During all this time, you will join 5mans for gear, but dont make preraid bis your priority.  You have 4-6 months to farm MC.  Once you get your epic mount, farming  becomes a lot easier.
---
Arww, female nelf casting animation is awesome!
---
I did \*g
---
 I think i'd still keep the points there for times when I need to be sat back casting, like a huge AV clash perhaps. Plus if I get a hand of edward the odd, I could use it on a lightning bolt, then hard cast a CL with elemental mastery.
---
Even if the CL gets interrupted, a crit frost shock is nothing to sneeze at
---
10/10 post.   
---
I might as well.   
---
I'll just do the same noob stuff in used to do.   
---
Tank in Arms stance.   
---
DPS as heals and ignore mana.  
---
Need on anything with stamina.
---
Probably when Classic becomes more popular than retail. Shouldn't take long given current subs are rumored to be 2,000,000 or less.
---
This would make for a cool poster in my apartment!
---
It's funny that the instance location is marked as Razorfen Kraul yet it's on the east side of the main road where RFD is
---
Game glitches I didn't get to pick my race or class and Guldans the President, can we reroll?
---
I am at a horrid impass. My wife wants to be a healer. She is super passive in her play style and likes healing people.  She is an average healer. I played a healer in vanilla. I played every class and role. Healer has always been my favorite role due to the reactiveness of it. There is ALWAYS something to react to. Very little scripted mechanics in priest healing.  
---
That being said, what should I play on Horde side starting out with a holy priest. She will certainly go holy to start with. I loved Enhance shaman as my second choice, but with my friend group primarily being dps classes and NOBODY playing a tank... am I forced to roll a warrior?  
---
I have been googling and watching videos and I am just torn as I do not know if she will really enjoy the rough grind and tougher playstyle of WoW. She is a HUGE ESO fan, so I am struggling on what to do. Druids can do about everything, but with no Rez, it kinds sucks..  
---
Thoughts?
---
I loved not being told where to go, no hand holding, just "here's a massive world figure it out".
---
Best feeling
---
Can you share the original versions? I might remove the logos eventually. There's versions out there without a logo but in much lower resolution. They should still work as a good reference.
---
Fine, it’s why WoW very likely has less that 1 mil subscribers.
---
What patience?  Thanks for the chuckle.
---
Twinks?
---
I’m saying its unrealistic because blizzard is a company they aren’t gonna waste extra resources to split the community.
---
You gotta think about the profits, something that people completely miss.
---
You’re right there will be decline but not doing anything and allowing the player base to slowly decline will kill off WoW classic. Players will stop having the incentive to pay 15 a month and just play private servers in the end.
---
Blizzard is gonna have to make an incentive to keep players giving the 15$ and doing that will be by either completely going to TBC or making new content for vanilla.
---
Don't forget to run out of arrows mid way through the run and switch to your gun from 20 lvls ago that doesn't have 300 weapon skill
---
Same reason their is so many gaps in content while leveling/questing. Oh shit we are out of time on launch but we know we don't have enough quests in these level gaps oh well we can just add it after launch players are not gonna level that fast. OH GOD they are 60 already how the fuck???? This is why Hinterlands was added post launch and Silthus had sweet fuck all on launch they literally didn't have time to do that.
---
They don't need to get it in 1 try, they just need to get it.
---
Also the naxx frost gear is obviously better but you can gear well enough to kill saph from some dungeon frost resist gear drops and filling in the rest with frost greens. 
---
A guild pushing for world first could also have a few alt rouges farming runes while they push through the rest of the bosses to make a few better frost pieces for the tank and maybe a few healers.
---
If you have to watch anything, make sure it is only this:

---
My exams finish on June 21st so this would legit be perfect
---
Those damned melons found me again.
---
No resets. Just make a eternal server we can transfer to or start new servers.
---
It’s classic wow. There will be no dead servers
---
You could spec for tanking and spam live strat runs. General rule is the tank gets the first orb. That could be 25-75G per run depending on the economy.
---
While I was never told to kill myself for playing ret in BC, people randomly whispering me "lol ret" or "respec holy scrub" or "unsub" were common...people I never said a word to or even grouped with. That said, I have been told to unsub and kill myself on several occasions for offenses such as not facerolling through dungeons...or not wearing heirlooms...or doing damage as disc because apparently doing damage isn't necessary to heal as a disc priest (a popular opinion among those who have never played disc...or a healer at all). Perhaps some servers are less toxic than others, idk...but I am looking forward to Classic and toxic players being blacklisted by everyone except other toxic players.
---
There is the possibility of a main wand spec, depending on the behaviors of fire wands and mage talents alongside Flame Buffet.
---
I have so many questions about why they burdened male nelf with those animations.
---
To me it sounds like you'd have more fun as a shaman. The appreciation you receive from melee dps for your totems always feels good. I was always chummy with the warriors which led to some very lucrative 2-man instance farming. Also running end game dungeons with a shaman and 4 melees means some of the fastest clear times around. Elemental is also a fully viable PvP spec, which is an added bonus. For druids is heal/tank in PvE and flag run in PvP.
---
Assuming you’ll be playing with her a lot then druids will be great. Like you said they can fill every role and are superb dungeon tanks
---
It's a mat for flasks. And flasks provide a buff that persists through death.
---
I’ll get an album together if I can later today!
---
This guy gets it
---
I see vods of people clearing naxx being clickers and wearing inappropriate gear, people who had 200 /played but didn't even fix their keybinds or UI. People didn't experiment shit.
---
I actually really like female troll animations, they are surprisingly decent when it comes to classic animations.
---
And greater blessings are by class.
---
A big reason to play on PVP servers is to kill the person kiting this.
---
Thank you!!
---
paladins can build for aoe farming, consecration, blessing of santuary, imp ret aura. They can do more than 4 mobs with cooldowns and consumes, depends a lot on the type of mob. Fast attack speed is the best targets because you get the best dps from your aura, more  but smaller crits against you, and higher total mitigation of the mobs dmg.
---
But wan't the Naga in some Tibetan lake, and the Pirates somewhere close to Cuba?
---
I want vanilla T1 T2 T3 difficulty of all the content that was left out of Vanilla.   There is a huge list.    
---
Give me Kaz.   
---
Hyjal.  
---
Uldum. 
---
CoT.   
---
All of it.   
---
No T4 thx.   
---
All at lvl 60
---
Well, mark me down as scared and horny.
---
Same I like female troll the most Horde side.
---
Can confirm I was a level 10 Dwarf Hunter with a Bear named Bub in 2005
---
I would if it was available, but for now it’s pvp.
---
How will choosing a sub-optimal race/class combination affect my ability to join up with semi-hardcore raiding guilds?
---
I'm interested in fury DPS and would prefer Undead over Orc for aesthetic reasons.  From what I have researched, I'm expecting a fairly significant DPS decrease, somewhere in the neighborhood of 10%.
---
Personally, I'm OK with the DPS loss, but I'm concerned that raiding guilds would not be.
---
For a second I was thinking, "Wow, eastern kingdoms really looks a lot like Africa, blizz is so lazy"
---
I'm retarded
---
Should I have a mage alt?
---
I mained a mage in TBC, WotLK and Legion and I just love that class, especially in PvP. However, I also enjoy healing in WoW and always had a "healing alt" I could switch to, mainly priest or paladin.
---
That's why for Classic, I already decided that I'll give in to my healing desires this time and main a paladin. I did A LOT of research and testing and I really like it. However, I feel like there's still something missing. I think mage and paladin hit different spots for me. At this point I think I want two different things from this game.
---
So, instead of going back to "paladin or mage", why not "paladin AND mage". The mage would make a great farming alt and I heard he doesn't need too much gear to shine in PvP, so I could focus on gearing my paladin. Also, after leveling, my mage could be Herb/Eng and my pally Alch/Eng. This way, my mage could collect the herbs for my pally since he has an easier time killing mobs that I aggro during the process.
---
Does that make sense? I just want to hear some opinions on my thoughts.
---
Solo aoe isn't really achievable as any other class unless if you are fighing very weak units like lashers in DME.
---
It shows Brexitland as an Icelandic codfish colony
---
Afaik only very few people actually manage to reroll entirely, even then some end up having the new character be an earthworm. most just end up deleting the character for good - would not recommend
---
I'd just wait man, it'll be way better that way
---
&gt;You have been removed from the group.
---
Dominate in 1v1 PvP (#1 arguably) and A tier in PvE
---
/1 Anyone seen Rexxar?
---
The worst part of the chain on horde side, especially with a +60% mount!
---
I really like Orc warrior melee animations
---
Hmm, is that some prehistorical map? Europe looks exactly like some Upper Paleolithic Europe - with no sea between Denmark and Sweden, and a dry passage from Great Britain.

I kind of want to annoy people by asking where the transmog guy is or if anyone knows where to learn inscription.
---
Healers hands down has it easiest. 
---
Next up rogues spend very little time getting ready for their weekly raids, however getting prebis takes a long time. 
---
Mage/warlock has to spend a ton of money, if you are an efficient farmer it's actually pretty fast, but if you are not it's hell.
---
"Change" It was released in 1.12 because the que times made the pvp rewards unattainable for some people. Same applies here IMO. Plus, what does it actually hurt? If people want to have the option to opt out of it, add a check box that says "Server only" or something. Long que times will kill the playerbase. People that want to do some quick pvp will NOT be able to wait for 30+ minutes. That is just crazy these days.
---
Im gonna join groups as healer because I have first aid
---
The last post about release date was about an hour ago...
---
That's like a record around here
---
56k and a PC that was brand new in 1999.  I was playing a PowerPoint presentation the entire time, so I feel ya. 
---
 It will definitely be better, it will also definitely be different.    For some of us this game will be brand new again just because of the junk we were playing with vs. what we have now.  Honestly can't wait to experience it with a computer that can actually handle it :D
---
yes
---
Was it even in vanilla?
---
"Huh why is this imp lvl ??"
---
Man I wish lmao.
---
[r/outside](http://reddit.com/r/outside)

 Well the thing is. Farming those consumables is a time saver. You can talk all about how you can clear raids without consumes. It's completely true, but it's worth putting the time in to farm consumes in order to actually be able to clear the raids instead of taking 3 months of chain wiping because you have to perfect tactics instead of using dps to beat the encounter.
---
With 20/31/0 you can farm all the same WPL farms mages can without using wierd consumables or anything....you literally just need 31 pts in prot+consecrate+shield spike.
---
Yeah, every guild I've been in has prioritized raid spots for people who show up consistently.
---
Yeah EPL used to feel DANGEROUS
---
My brother used to wait to see people "WTB X Enchantment" in trade chat.  He would then go find them in whatever city they were in and randomly open trade, not a word said.  They would just plop in all their mats and he would just get shit for free.  If they reported him to a GM, he just said they gave it to him.
---
&gt;could you still see the world tree in vanilla?
---
Not from outside the zone
---
Maybe it's because I was Horde, but I came the other way through the Blackrock Mountain. I was scared to death of Alliance territories close to Stormwind.
---
What does your post complaining about retail has to do with classic?
---
You were in a shit raid then if that hunter was outdpsing a fair amount of people.  
---
  Hunters have to manage tempo on auto shot, feign death trinket swap, pet management and micro, kiting, tranquilizing on demand, engineering with and between these to boosts some of these things like rocket boots when kiting, squeeze in melee, nightfall possibly as hunters are one of the best, meaning you spam wing clip until nightfall procs, then do all this in the short window you have until nightfall drops and then spam wing clip again.  
---
  Failing some of these result in a wipe.
---
I want to heal raids and pve content, but I don't want to heal pvp once I have gear from whatever phase we're in. I can't decide between healing classes. Right now I think I would be happy healing as anyone, but I can't decide what the best/most fun would be for battleground pvp. I like jumping into small skirmishes or even fighting alone when I pvp. What class should I play?
---
How's mage utility compared to warlocks? I like being helpful but don't really enjoy healing lol
---
Nope. It won't be anywhere near as fun when everyone is expecting it.
---
That and, there would just be endless bitching about it on the forums.
---
Really? Damn! We're doing well!
---
To me, Moonglade has always been, and will be, a level 10-16 zone.
---
And what does A tier mean?
---
I mean since we can assume a mass exodus of tourists in 5-6 months, why not just release them at that point. I could see queues being fairly long by then (and by fairly long i mean 30+ minutes. I dont necessarily mind a 10-15 min queue.)
---
Be sure to only use light linen bandages. Few things more annoying than having first aid maxed out, getting injured, and having some "helpful idiot" slap a low level bandage on you triggering the cooldown preventing you from using your own, much better, bandages on yourself.
---
The maxlevel is like 120 right? Seems that most people unsub before that so must be a shit game.
---
STV to Tirisfall is also a thing.
---
pally/shaman

This is impressive and it's good to know that it doesn't require reaching the gear ceiling and fighting patchwerk to perform. But it's just not worth shelling out gold for all those consumables every time. Tbh like 90% of players will at most have rallycry, 1 or 2 flasks, and one consumable. And that's enough to comfortably clear content. Compare this build with that amount of preparation. Why go through all of that prep when I could just heal and respec later for half the price and work? Or play anything else and do better with next to no preparation?
---
"Just for the hell of it" is the only answer to those questions, because you could just go 25/26/0 and still be a monster.
---
But at the end of the day- play what you want :)
---
Overrated game. Unbalanced system. Unfair rewards. Professions achievements require unnecessary amount of work. 3/10 would not live again.
---
When you scale content to gear level in a game whose core concept is getting better gear, this is hardly surprising.  I really hope you're right.
---
Slowly but surely, thought the years, we lost something truly glorious.
---
heh, this is exactly like I discovered Burning Steppes. A similar thing would be me questing in Duskwood and be like ''oh Deadwind Pass is probably where I suppose to go next...''
---
My brother used to wait to see people spamming "WTB X Enchantment" in trade chat. He would then go find them in whatever city they were in and randomly open trade, not a word said. They would just plop in all their mats and he would accept it all for nothing. If they reported him to a GM, he just said they randomly gave it to him.
---
There were a ton of bad players all through the game, no doubt (we had clickers in our guild during aq, when you need 40 warm bodies you take what you can get sometimes). Lots of people didn't bother to do their homework but for the most part the knowledge of bis/spec/rotation, etc. was out there by the end of vanilla if you were willing to dig through elitist jerks and other sources.
---
The point is that something like frontstabbing is such a completely basic mechanic that it would be discovered easily just by playing the game normally, it doesn't require any extra skill or knowledge for it to happen. Any dummy can wiggle around and realize they can suddenly backstab. 
---
And if it supposedly ever existed, why isn't there a patch where it was fixed?
---
Yeah, Lionheart is a raid item though, so there’s a bit of leeway for a few months.
---
To clarify, this isn't a bug. In vanilla wow when you moused over your wand in the character sheet you would see "+ xdmg". That was your total spell power that effected the damage type matching your wand. So if you have 150 spell power and 30 frost spell power, your fire wand would show +150, while a frost wand would show the full +180.
---
The spell power has no effect on wands at all, it was just hamfisted into the UI. I for one hope they add a few things like haste and spell crit chance, even crit chance based on school to the character sheet. Just make it a toggle if people want to sperg over "spell crit used to be an esoteric stat that required spreadsheets."
---
Upthralls to the left
---
What melee would want hand of edward though?
---
In what world is March 1st technically winter?
---
Can you actually level from 10 to 20 in Silverpine? I hate Barrens
---
you can leave the apartment for free? Enjoy the local part, lake, go to the cinema, friends, family...
---
Ill say wait for classic. If you start now in retail you may find yourself alone and not willing to push thru 120 levels.
---
if they just didnt confirm it no one would expect it
---
You’re gunna have a rough go in vanilla with that thinking
---
Are you kidding? Literally the equivalent of a batch server transfer. They literally can transfer all characters in a realm to another realm during a single Tuesday maintenance. They refrain from doing it because nerds lose their shit if they have to choose a server with a different name that first time they log on.
---
I think it was subconcience but I picked a frost mage.
---
Make sure to / follow the healer after each boss fight until someone says something in chat.
---
&gt; You were in a shit raid then if that hunter was outdpsing a fair amount of people. 
---
'noticeable' =/= top. 
---
My guild would clear MC, Ony, BWL, and ZG in one night. We finished most of AQ 40 and killed a Naxx boss. Were we the best? Obviously not. Were we shit? Obviously not. 
---
&gt; Hunters have to manage tempo on auto shot, feign death trinket swap, pet management and micro, kiting, tranquilizing on demand, engineering with and between these to boosts some of these things like rocket boots when kiting, squeeze in melee, nightfall 
---
None of this is necessary. It will make you better, sure, but not required by any means. No one cares about Nightfall after a point, and hunters are never top DPS in vanilla. Maybe on a fight or 2 that affects melee more than ranged, but even then, mages will probably do more DPS.
---
&gt; Failing some of these result in a wipe. 
---
No it wont. Tranq shot maybe, but that's nothing, and is only required for certain fights. No where near as much to care about as the MT or healers.
---
windfury is in line with the others for dps, look at melderan and deathcamp(i think i got that right?) videos on youtube. They haveone for shaman weapon buffs its like 30 minutes to an hour.
---
2 monitors!

Tits
---
Did any of those blank spots get filled in?
---
I agree with you. I played heavily when wow was released. My brother was living in America and I played on their servers for 2 yrs. I re-rolled on EU server (bought the eu game) when TBC was announced and raided heavily till MoP and Cat.
---
Then I quit due to time and having a family. 
---
Classic wow has me really interested having not played for 6-7 yrs. I still miss wow, but really miss classic wow.
---
Having guilds farming black dragon scales for fire res, doing quests to be raid ready. Travelling en mass to raid MC/BWL/AQ seemed epic. 
---
Even running early 5 man instances like Strath or Scholo and 15 UBRS, seemed so much more amazing than any other expansion instances.
---
I’m defo coming outta gaming hibernation for classic. 
---
Just need to get the gaming laptop purchased and the old account re-activated. Haha
---
One thing that bothers me about Vanilla... those zones that are not present but you can tell they are meant to be there.
---
Not really, i was a horny teen back in the days :P
---
Winter doesn't end until March 20th for those in the Northern Hemisphere.
---
Well after you get exalted you sorta hate it. It IS way better though atm. Just wish they weren't doing the 1.12 AV
---
How much do you think all those consumables cost?
---
One of patches (1.9-1.10?) Normalized pets so each family has same base atk speed, health, resistances, dps .
---
I have a friend at work who decided to try out a private server with his wife after I mentioned classic and how pumped I was.  They apparently tried it for 2 hours, fought, then stopped playing it because it was too hard.  
---
I'm sure there will be some other people who enjoy the slower paced game and the hardcore mentality.
---
People usually hard reset vanilla servers though.
---
Honestly, this sub will downvote anything and everything you have an opinion on.
---
People complaining is different from having to get a super majority of people to agree to a change.
---
Even an "early addition" seems like a band-aid solution, though. I really want to play on an RPvP server, but I'm champing at the bit to play Classic just like everyone else is. If  my options at launch are "roll on an RP or PvP server" or "wait an indeterminate amount of time for RPvP realms"... you know damn well I'm not going to make myself wait even longer, and I very much doubt I'm alone in that.
---
The only way to accurately gauge the size of the community is to give us at least one RPvP realm in each region *at launch.* By waiting until after launch, Blizzard will be simply be repeating the selfsame mistake that kneecapped their potential popularity and led to the perception of it being such a niche server type in the first place.
---
A warlock with a healer
---
How do they make money then? Professions?
---
Don't put it past them. I've had people (seemingly legitimately) tell me they wanted server queues and multiple hour waits just to be able to log in because "lolz #nochanges"
---
It happens in heroes of the storm, another blizzard game. No idea if it happens in retail.
---
Lol what? :D
---
It allows for the creation of mercenary-esque guilds, whom you can pay gold to protect you during your events, just to name an example.
---
Some RPers can't stand it when the opposite faction interferes their event, and that's fine, they can enjoy RP realms. For us it's part of the experience and forces you to always be on your toes, also during events.
---
Tanaris. Tanaris all day, every day. Been my favorite zone since I first stepped into it. I've done every quest there so many times.
---
After years of vanilla pservers I've found there are still plenty of "noobs" the way there was in vanilla. Clearly not anywhere near as many, but I still see them out there.
---
Can also be true but also drops from mobs people may be interested for other reasons (like in Searing Gorge).
---
You know damn well I rolled a dwarf hunter because of that cinematic
---
Oh man, my first Wow playing was done on about a 3 inch thick HP laptop. Wow made it soooo hot. I literally could not go into IF during the day. I would get about 2fps if I tried. I had to wait until 2 am and then head in for the specifics I needed and get out. It did SW better, but still not great. It was bad, and I have fond memories of it.
---
It depends on a few factors but it's definitely an unfavourable matchup. First of all, if you aren't specced frost at least until ice block it's a free loss if the lock is not a complete noob. This is however not an issue because if you want to play PvP in a more serious manner you want to be ele (fire/frost) or deep frost with fire or arcane (ignite or imp cs). Arguably the best spec against a Warlock is frost with improved counterspell, so you will have barrier, ice block and counterspell as defensive abilities, and the nova frostbolt/CoC shatter combo for insane burst.
---
If you play horde, roll undead and you got another counter (will of the forsaken racial ability) for breaking fear or seduction of the succubus. If you are asking me, I would choose mage over warlock any day. Yes, you can spec soullink as a WL and be a king in world pvp, but a) it's boring AF and b) before bwl/naxx gear it kinda sucks from a dmg perspective. Furthermore, if you want to play Warlock and you are not orc, enjoy getting stunlocked. 
---
I recommend to play Mage and get engineering. Engi provides you with the tools that make hard matchups easier and can turn them into your favor (iron grenades, shadow reflector). If you wanna go horde, roll undead. If you wanna go alliance, roll gnome (+5% int and escape artist).
---
So to sum it up:
---
\- 1v1 vs Warlock is nasty but it is nasty for every class. A sl specced WL is a raidboss but you CAN win it as a mage.
---
\- Mage has more mobility
---
\- Mage is more fun in my opinion
---
\- You can beat every class as Mage
---
Alts, second chars how ever you call them ;)
---
You get an upvote from me!
---
I tried playing once after the level scaling took place. The only thing I liked about it was how you could complete more quests in an area before they all turned gray.
---
But... that wouldn't be an issue in the first place if killing six boars didn't make you outlevel an area. I understand trying being more casual friendly, but I feel like they took it too far over the years, and wound up alienating other groups in the process.
---
I'm not a hardcore player, but I enjoy leveling, seeing all the quests, paying attention to the stories in each area, and having to think about my actions. Flying to Stormwind to turn off XP and unequipping most of my gear are not fun ways of remedying that.
---
People like us are lucky that we're getting Classic.
---
Nah, Desla will trade Dragonfinger of Healing before it gets patched out. xD
---
Hmm  this ones got me thinking.  &lt;30 is doable by alliance starting zones belligrub beeing a lv24 so it’s going to be slow.  Then as you reach lv30 running in to and out of rfk Killing first boar and out /reset. 
---
Ashenvale boars lv 54
---
Plagueboars is lv60
---
Basically you could perhaps get to lv40~ on boars alone.  But in reality around lv 25.  
---
You should be able to kill 5 levels above you with some hurdles so the big problem would be 25-50 
---
You would however be controlling the market of gortusk livers ;).
---
I chose gnome in vanilla so I can't say the trailer helped in that lmao.
---
Yup, I hear ya! I eventually had the big screen TV with satellite TV positioned so I could watch movies as I grinded for mats for raiding or gold farming. Sometimes fishing for hrs as I watched films. 
---
I quit gaming when I had a family and kids got in the way of spending hrs on the pc. Now they are older and I heard about classic wow, I’m planning on buying a good gaming laptop, so I can sit on it while the wife watches TV...can take it to wrk and play when I have a chance....or travelling...and also so I can watch TV with the wife as I level.
---
Can’t wait for classic. Got to admit I am very excited to emerge from gaming hibernation for classic wow.
---
Ffxiv is more akin to current WoW and therefore not really as much of a competitor to Classic.  I’d be more interested in what FFXI might do for a classic scene, but they likely missed the boat and have nothing to bring to the table.
---
If OP is right I will cashapp them $100.
---
Last update was 3 days ago though.
---
It's missing the random black dot in the middle of nowhere that makes you ask yourself why is it there.
---
Private sector you mean? Unless you are part time any public sector job I've seen down here in FL has 10 or more paid holidays on top of annual and sick leave usually accured each pay period.
---
i don't have a wife or kids, but that doesn't mean i don't have other responsibilities.  
---
I have been playing on a private server for a couple of months and we have 2 raid days a week at about 3 hour blocks between 6pm PST - 9pm PST on Tues/Thurs.  works great for me and i don't feel like i am ignoring the important things in life and i still have my weekends freed up for anything, whether it be maintenance on my house or grabbing a beer with old friends.  
---
That would be a minimum play time for me but i still get on for an hour or 2 before bedtime to farm up mats for raid or to PvP.  
---
I think its possible to play semi-casually, but it is probably not going to easy to hit R14 unless you send your wife and children on a vacation without you for a few weeks after you hit R11/R12.  the 600k-1M honor per week grind will eat you alive.
---
Twink is a character you level to something ended with 9, with level 9 excluded. You then gear up your character as much as possible and have a better chance in low level BGs. Highest level in the bracket plus likely best gear if you have the time/money means you can dominate most BGs.
---
Won't fall into lava if you are a clever paladin (with engineering)
---
Haha, thanks, and agreed!  I'm real excited to play it and feel the progression again.
---
Implementing level scaling felt like fixing a squeaky door with a sledgehammer (a dumb sledgehammer).  I expected them to make experience earnable from real low level quests, with a decaying formula, or something like that.  Instead, they decided to effectively remove leveling altogether (besides the time invested, obviously).
---
I've recommended this campaign to WoW fans for a while. It is a total prelude to WoW and a super fun campaign.
---
Don't most schools go back in session after summer break in August?
---
Most schools let out for summer at end of May.
---
At least where I'm from...Central time U.S.
---
So if we go by what Schools in Central U.S. consider "Summer Break", Summer begins June 1, and ends Sep 1.
---
Which is the real thrust of the issue. RPvP realms weren't rolled out in Vanilla until 1.8, nearly a year after the game launched. By that point most people who might have been interested in rolling there had already invested a lot of time into characters and established themselves among the community of other servers. Sure, some made the jump, but I'd wager a lot more decided it wasn't worth the cost.
---
The only way to accurately gauge the size of the community is to have at least one RPvP realm available in each major region *at launch.* Otherwise they're simply repeating the selfsame mistake that kneecapped their potential popularity and led to the perception of it being such a niche interest in the first place.
---
I never had money as a Resto Shaman. I had no Profession either though my first time through. I never got an epic mount in Vanilla. I did raid, and saw at least part of every raid, only downed 1 boss in Naxx though. But I really don't know. The only Shaman that I knew well bought gold to get his mount, lol. 
---
I am going to be a Shaman again and I think I'm going to level up with Skinning/Herbalism, switch to Alch/Eng at 60 and level an alt to gather mats after that.
---
I've also been looking into farming gold in an early Classic setting (as in, within the first few weeks of launch) and I think I'll be able to hit 50g/hour reliably without AoE, just farming mobs for greys/leather and vendoring them. More with lucky drops and herb/mining spawns.
---
What is dead may never die
---
Emerald Dream was one of the best WoW servers for a long while.
---
I don't plan on rolling RP-PvP, but damn, there should be at least 1 per region.
---
great work man
---
Yeah - that's exactly why I suggested TBC. It's the most obvious solution and honestly almost guaranteed if classic is successful IMO, TBC seems to be about as revered as vanilla. Wrath, eh, I don't know. I would personally but at that point you'd also have to consider further X-Pac servers. Who knows.
---
But people do follow streamers around all day. Most of the big streamers have this issue constantly. Not just wow streamers but plenty of FPS streamers get targeted, followed, sniped constantly. They shouldn't complain as they have asked for it, but to your specific point: I think you underestimate just how bored some people are.
---
I need to go eat, brb in 40 minutes as healer or tank. And this have to happen at 3 oclock after 1 hour and half long dungeon, just near the end. You are impossible to replace so JUST WAIT -.-
---
Is this the picture with its eyes following you or was that in Scholomance? I cant remember.
---
I mean, I'd like to get a second realm so I can play both factions without going to a different server type.
---
That's very much an "eventually" thing, though; at launch, just give us one so we can consolidate and clearly demonstrate the demand for RPvP.
---
What were some of your most memorable moments working as a GM during vanilla. Was there a certain day / event that stood out?
---
I mean instead of refreshing so much, you can just join this subreddit's discord channel and then subscribe to the #game-news channel and have it send notifications to your phone / computer when something new gets posted in there.
---
Since most of what we are getting is 1.12 I would hazard they will be in from the start. I think they were added 1.9? 1.10? So not a huge difference there. Not sure if all recipes etc will be available or not but that's separate.
---
How did you get job...
---
Work rom home or office?
---
What was the pay?
---
What was the worst thing you banned someone for ?
---
The US is missing a mountain range and the one isn't on top of the coast. Good map though
---
How often would you say Hand of Edward the Odd procs?
---
With around 4-8 hours a week you can easily play some Classic WoW. If you are a veteran then you already know what to do so leveling won't be too harsh.  
---
However, I'd suggest rolling a PvE server mainly because if you aren't sixty by Phase 2 then it will probably suck getting ganked ruthlessly. (I say this because that is my dad's philosophy as you are in their same position atm.)
---
Thanks for doing this! Its always cool to see things from a GM's side. My question is, what is your most memorable interaction with a player whether that was returning gear, fixing something with their account, etc.?
---
People thinking this is a lot of consumables should stay far away from Classic. The video just shows what is mandatory consumables in most guilds.
---
absolutely. here is our discord. we pop in and out there talking. a few of us are on private servers too practicing. there wont be too much sweat dont worry, we have families and personal lives now. was much different back when we were in middle school and highschool https://discord.gg/kg36zM
---
What really happens when the Unstoppable Force meets the Immoveable Object?
---
Any stories of GM Island? Did you ever track a player or group as they explored where they shouldn’t, or did some other deviant behavior?
---
I am stuck on an alliance Warlock or Hunter. I played both to 20 to see and I enjoy aspects of each. I love how quick hunters can plow through mobs. But the sustain and variety of warlock spells keeps me interested too. Ammo/feed vs soul shards. 
---
I'll mainly PvP with a night or two of raids. Not looking to be top of the top, just to have fun. Hunter is nice in BGs with the extreme range. But warlock has a bit more sustain and no dead zone. I played Hunter from cata to BfA but never did warlock. I think the lack of mobility always turned me away. But being classic, mobility is much different for all classes. 
---
I'm stuck!!
---
Silverpine is pretty sweet because it's all on a single main road. Love Silverpine.
---
Yeah the most populated servers being unplayable is definitely the minority /s
---
You forgot FEIGN DEATH and survive while everyone else die because of you.
---
How many people had to monitor barrens chat?
---
Having leveled a shaman to 60 in vanilla I would recommend concentrating on ENH and using the 'dot' rotation for mob killing, its really effect and consistent damage. 
---
Lightning Shield + Flame Tongue Weapon + Flame Shock + Searing Totem is enough to kill all mobs while leveling. Use a 1h+shield.
---
Nah, you should be fine. Fury still pulls down a fuck ton of dps. And you may be 3-10% lower than an orc, but that means you also aren't as likely to pull threat from a tank.
---
July 16th is now less than 2 months away. Their most recent WoW release was BFA which was announced on April 5th with an August 14th release date, i definitely think we're going to get a late summer release date.
---
what about bear tank
---
i assume the gear for that is a pain to get
---
Probably 15g or so in total.
---
Female human stealth animation is the cutest
---
When I was in high school I wanted to go to the movies with friends, so I sold 100g to china famers and 30 minutes later was banned. DID YOU DO THIS TO ME!?
---
Gotta get that sweet rep.
---
Planning to do all the Starter zones on my main. From Redcloud Mesa to Valley of Trials, to Deathknell, to the Soliden Pumpkin Farm, to Brill, then the rest until I get bored and continue like a normal person.

Blizzard is and probably always will be an internal numbers only company.  You could have 100 million people on this sub but to them they don't have the numbers for classic wow's popularity until they launch it and see how many accounts make characters and get to a certain threshold.  While not that many people may be playing bfa compared to wotlk.. and it may be in a rough spot... it still will hold more players than classic. 
---
Even if classic got 1 million subs first week... bfa would be at what? 5-7 million still?  even if bfa got down to like 3 million... I don't think classic would get that high at launch at least.
---
Bugs and lag please  :)
---
It was always my intention to roll RPvP from the moment Classic was announced. It never even occurred to me it wouldn't be an option, so I never really made any noise about it.
---
I think most of us were in that same boat, which is why it came as such a shock when Ion announced they weren't planning to do it, and why we're all so adamant and vociferous in making noise about it now.
---
This is a quality reddit post right here.
---
Did you ever play around with those GM weapons?
---
You know realms still exist, right? [Check it out yourself.](https://www.wowprogress.com/)
---
I am not comparing current retail with Classic, I am comparing people's general interest in RPPVP vs RPPVE on retail. You do realize that a lot of people on Classic are going to be coming from retail too, right? Surely you can't be completely ignorant of the fact that Blizzard might have more faith in metrics from their own current game than some 18k survey done on who knows where.
---
hunter , he would be the guy who pulled half the instance or left his pet on agro
---
How did they fuck up so bad? I remember having 2+ raids full of people hitting Stormwind and never lagging half as bad.
---
Just to play devil's advocate for a sec, if the whole community vocally supported it, but only 7 people actually wanted to play on it, they would get a very DOA server and experience.
---
I do support this in in a general sense, and hope people have the experience they want, but in practice I wonder if perhaps a petition should be started that is only (in theory) signed/supported by people intending to play on it.
---
As someone who called Illidan-US home since vanilla, I remember Serenity Now more than the person who actually died.
---
I also remember all the people who rolled characters on Illidan over it or memed about it for months. But the memes were always about Scatman or SN. I think the only thing I remember about the person who died was that they picked the zone because it was their favourite or something, which is why they didn't pick a non-pvp area.
---
Like the other guy said, if you play with her a lot, the res won't be an issue and you can fill what ever roll your party needs as a druid. That being said, if you want to roll shamin, go for it. It's a LOT easier to find a tank if your group already has the healer rolled filled.
---
&gt; or did some other deviant behavior?
---
Every GM who ever went to Goldshire saw some deviant behaviour.
---
It won't
---
You wouldn't get the chance to roll, would be on master looter from the start.
---
You indeed had the dream job.
---
I remember thinking at the age of 19: If only I could be a Game Master and make $13 an hour! I would be set! But I didn't live in Texas. D:
---
How did you get the job and what was the interview process like?
---
Classic is MMORPG in full meaning of that term. If you ever played a true oldschool MMORPG then you know what I'm talking about. If not... well...
---
Base game (retail) is basically an action game with gambling elements. Move fast, kill fast, spam abilities. Random items with random stats dropping from random places. 
---
Two different games at this point. Its unlikely someone enjoying retail will enjoy classic, and vice versa.
---
I was ALMOST excited for level scaling, because of the aforementioned quest completion. But then it just brought up a whole new issue - hey, I'm level 60 and I've only touched three areas! Off to Outland / Northrend, unless I turn off my XP, YET AGAIN. So long term, it still has the same issue. (Could've just made a damned button to turn off XP - it's an enormous hassle, and it's too cheap to be a gold sink. What's the point?)
---
I can't wait for Stalvan to scare me again!
---
&gt; Honestly to me that means an early/mid summer release date
---
No, it just means summer
---
I think you underestimate how much work classic is. 
---
Sure they can follow people in a game where there's no time investment, everyone can load up wow and get a instant maxed char or whatever. Everyone can load up the newest battle royale or whatever and try snipe the streamer. For you to actually do something signficant with the streamer, you need to not only play on the same server as the streamer, but also put in at least 100 hours to play with them. I think there's very few of the obnoxious twitch idiots who will actually do that.
---
Offt not a chance of me getting even back to Marshal. I remember staying off uni for 2 weeks and playing GBs in full teams for 6-7 hrs a day just to get there!  Great times, but zero chance of that. 
---
I’d be happy getting to 60 and doing 5-15 mans and BGs and AV. 👍😂
---
How did you handle corpsecamping and low level griefing?
---
Great question!  There were so many, but if I had to pin point the most memorable day it would probably be the day of the Zul Gurub plague.
---
When I arrived to work that day my roommate who was on the overnight shift came up to me the moment I walked in the door and said something to the effect of, 'OMG IT'S ABSOLUTE MADNESS, EVERY SERVER HAS THE PLAGUE"  I had no idea what I was walking into, total mass hysteria, in the best way possible.
---
No one knew what to do, how to handle it, what the chain of command for dealing with it was, tickets were flooding in way WAY faster than we could answer them, and we were all laughing our asses off the entire time.  
---
Generally 99% of tickets are real clear cut and in that 1% that involves a little extra thought you would check with a manager or if it was real serious they would check with a Lead.  This was every ticket that day.
---
Eventually the leads appeared in major cities and summoned people into the air to cure the plague.  Even then there were so few leads and so many servers it wasn't even fully resolved by the end of my shift.  That day was pretty much legend from there on out.
---
What kind of "powers" did you have as a GM, like could you add items/gold to you inventory? - If so, have you ever thought of abusing those powers to your own favor? And have you ever heard of GM's abusing their power and got caught?
---
How big was the GM team? Per region? Per server? Per game? Was it all just a single team or how did that work?
---
How many tickets per day was an average day? (Total received perhaps? or if you remember a # you completed in an entire work day)
---
What was the most interesting ticket you can remember receiving?
---
Honestly, herb/engi would give you more. But not having any gathering profs is going to make it super expensive! But warlocks are powerful in pvp. A warlock with engi and flasks and pots....just run.

&gt; July 16th is now less than 2 months away.

No it's not, it's 3 months away.
---
that is quite a saving grace though
---
MAGES OP!!!! TOO MUCH GOLDZ!!!!
---
There was several patches that changed NPC movement. As for fronstabbing it really isn't as easy as it may appear. You need to stand right infront of the target and spam the ability as you move back and forth. Honestly if none had told/showed me I'd never figured it out.
---
They actually fixed that really quickly, before most people had even hit 70 on fresh servers. But you could still kite Anachronos to Org all the way through WotLK.
---
THEMATICS
---
Who was it?... I wanna say Vin Diesel and Mila Kunis? I honestly don't remember if that was during the Vanilla days. Those names are sticking out in my mind, though.
---
Based on the loot changes coming to Classic, how much time was invested by GMs to just handling looting fiascos/ninjas/accidents/etc... Do you think this move from a former GM eyes is good or bad?
---
What are your views on Blizzard removing loot trading in non-raid instances?
---
How was the loot trading scene back in Vanilla?
---
What was the funniest you ever experienced and what was the most disturbing thing you experienced?
---
Yeah totally agree. EU- Argent Dawn was my old server. Wouldn’t like pvp as I level, too many higher level players liked to kill lowbies! 😂
---
Think I can get to 60 quite quickly, i loved levelling, was always best part for me. 
---
Now just plan to get my old account reactivated and get a gaming laptop so I can sit and be “sociable” to the wife as I level. 👍😀
---
He would play as a Murloc.
---
You're right, I'm dumb
---
Follow-up question: Were the chats monitored? Like did certain key-words flag a player conversation?
---
Maybe someone starts talking about illegal stuff and the conversation automatically gets flagged?
---
What are your thoughts on WoW as it stands today and the progression through the years?
---
Also, do you plan on playing classic?
---
That's really cool. had no idea you could do that.
---
Those twerps are in for a rude awakening
---
Mila Kunis definitely talked about playing a mage in an interview on a talk show at one point. It was either in vanilla or TBC.

It does from Blizzard's perspective. And the surveys do show a preference for PvP realms over PvE realms - not RP-PVP realms. 
---
Jackasses make polls on this subreddit at least once a week. It's just like I said in a previous comment, try and think outside of the Reddit/Classic WoW Discord bubble for a bit and you'll see that very few people actually do play on the RP-PVP servers.  
---
&gt; On the EU Classic WoW discord server is even one pole showing higher interest in RpPvP than in regular PvE realms.
---
It doesn't seem like it. 
---
&gt; The petition is of course not representive for the whole Playerbase of Classic. The people on discord servers and on reddit are the very core of the community.
---
So explain to me why 1.5k people out of 18k people from this subreddit are representative for the RP-PvP community but ~50k playing retail right now are not representative for the RP-PvP community when they're both going to be on the same sub and it's likely that we'll see a mix of both on those servers.
---
There is the that girl from The Guild who has been on a few tv shows.
---
Why don’t we pick a range of dates and make it a game with some type of wow related prize?
---
Wait for the beta to release, then you can [extract](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Extracting_interface_files) artwork files yourself and use their official [api](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/api-reference/world-of-warcraft-community-api) to fetch data. (I assume they'll update it for classic). Otherwise you need to download a 1.12 client and a mpq editor to extract the artwork files manually, and also use some kind of web scraper to retrieve info from wowhead etc. (No idea if wowhead even allows that)
---
Stop making a fool out of yourself: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20762276767
---
You can't be interested in (RP-)PvP on current retail if it's not there....
---
I chuckled.
---
\&gt; Yeah, but if a guild is inviting people they will always pick the people who dedicate their time to getting the best possible gear.
---
I've been an officer of a raiding guild in the past, and we always looked at experience, their application and gear choices rather than specific pieces they might or might not have. I can't imagine it being different in Classic. 
---
\&gt; If your guild has a loot council you better believe the guy/gal who farmed pre-bis, bis etc will be getting the items first. 
---
Loot council will give the loot to people who will benefit the guild the most. That is people with best attendance and performance. I've never heard about people caring about what kind of gear you currently have.
---
What were your directives from Blizzard? Like keeping the customera happy or have good numbers ect.
---
What was the "problem" server for game masters?
---
Barrens.chat is a great site with a lot of resources and guides. Check it out!
---
The only thing that does not add up is your reasoning. You simply cannot base the skill level of PvP and PvE players on your anecdotal experience of what I presume was one battleground. The fact is that BFA raid mechanics are much more complex and difficult than they were in vanilla. Vanilla PvE group content is trivial and mostly simply tank and spank.
---
The Bard.
---
Vin Diesel did play. He's talked about how he played WoW and was a big DnD nerd too.
---
What was the point of GM island and did people have their characters get sent to some prison there for questioning?
---
What was your favorite expansion?
---
And was there any cut content that you wished was in the game?
---
Warlocks have a curse or two that help the dps. However makes bring that tasty food/water as well as an amazing buff. Plus a mage can pull some amazing dps numbers.
---
I'm curious about this too, I was never punished for exploring in vanilla to mop, aq40 before it opened, Kara, old iron forge, under various areas and cities.  It seemed as long as you weren't griefing anyone they didn't care.
---
I bet he played an ALFA fury warrior
---
I don't think that is an issue. Our guild has already recruited over 250 people in a few months and we're growing everyday, and this is months ahead of Classic release.
---
It also doesn't account for the other guilds and the people that will join the realm on release.
---
I know you probably think that the upvotes might seem too little for this issue, but you'd be surprised at the amount of downvotes anything RP related gets on any WoW platform, including this subreddit. Some very nasty comments have been removed from this thread already, in fact.
---
where you in game when you did gm stuff?
---
did you actually chill at gm island?
---
there are a bunch of cool/interesting spots in wow did gm's bother going to them or d9ing world exploration while they played. I would have chilled in the hellfire test zone in dead mines.
---
I think it was later but one guy got sent martin fury and another a green mech strider sent to them by accident from gm's.
---
were you actually typeing in item codes? what was the interface like was there like just a box you could type any item or code into and send someone that item?
---
Lupos shadow damage removed and pet run speeds normalized in patch 1.9.
---
Pet Attack speeds were normalized in TBC patch 2.0.3.  
---
So Classic should have 1.0 attack  speed Broken Tooth, but no shadow damage from Lupos, and Takk the Leaper won't run down mounted players lol.
---
I got this info from another Reddit post after a quick "search"...fyi
---
Because it's already been discussed. One hundred times over.
---
Nobody tells you when you create a new character that it will talk back to you in hate.
---
Maybe he’s on vacation.
---
That means we'll probably get it in septermber
---
isn't spec tanking the same as speccing feral dps?
---
So, pservers are fine if you played classic before. But there data isn't 100% accurate. So a lot will change when the real version launches. 
---
Also, one of the major points to classic wow is exploration! I'd recommend that you wait for the real game, and go in with no expectations. I'd give almost anything to do that again myself!
---
how often did u transfer bop items from 1 player to another cause they asked
---
YouTube channel "Skarm Tank" has multiple videos on tanking and making money as a tank in/out of a group.
---
"Any 'dps' class should easily top those charts with the same gear and buffs. "  
---
If everyone uses those buffs, how can you say that "any" dps class would top charts? Your argument makes no sense.  
---
Also, if you are a melee dps and aren't using mongoose and giants in raid, you are not going to be very competitive in classic. This is like bare minimum consumes + spell power consumes.   
---
Have fun in your casual guild doing shit dps because you cant be assed to spend a bit of gold on consumes.
---
You don't recognize James Joyce? SMH

Anything is possible. Technically June still isn't off the table, but the longer it takes to get a release date, the later the release date will probably be.

Quite sure pools will be in the game.
---
It's pretty ironic how toxic you are.
---
Where are you now in regards to employment? Did you end up working with Blizzard or in the video game industry post college?
---
We need buttplugs, lots of buttplugs.
---

---
I mean that might he a little overstatement but there is a lot of meth and pills that go around in the small towns and hills.
---
My server WAS massively imbalanced. How was I lucky? I started this premade stuff myself by inviting people I met in random battlegrounds who I thought were good to group with. This wouldn't even be possible with crossrealm because everyone on my team would be in a different server. Everyone had the chance to make a premade, you needed to communicate with other people. Isn't this what classic is about?
---
Dead servers can be merged. Massively imbalanced servers can be merged with other imbalanced servers.
---
I think most healers wouldn't rez those kind of players so they'll have to run anyway :) It's a group effort and if someone is that kind of a player, he'll meet that kind of healers.
---
When I joined the GM team is was still relatively early in the life span, but I was hardly a first joiner either, the game had been out about 6 months and at the time Blizzard was still all in one building.  There honestly wasn't enough work stations for all of us to even work.
---
This changed real quick.  I think from the release of the game to when I got hired and quite a bit after they were on a cycle of hiring a new wave of around 20 new GMs every 2 weeks.  Eventually we grew so big we had to be in a separate building specific for customer service in the same commercial park.  Eventually CS would grow so large it was no longer only be handled in Irvine and then Blizzard campus opened up to provide even more space.
---
GMs worked across all servers and the ticket queue was universal.  We were broken up into smaller teams with a manager, but we all basically worked together.
---
There was a quota but it really was a sliding scale because the needs were constantly changing.  When I first got there, once I got the hang of it I could do somewhere between 250-300 tickets in a single shift, which was way beyond the quota.  Later on when the queues were real short it became hard to hit 100, but that was true for everyone, so long as you weren't lagging behind everyone else and being productive it was good.
---
I had mentioned in a thread a few days ago about a ticket I received about a guy who was mind controlled into the lava in BRM.  It became legend on my team because a friend of mine gave it a voice and tone inflections that was honestly perfect.  I can still say it with the voice to this day and it will never stop being hilarious to me.
---
The most bugged Blizzard server would have far less bugs than the best private server.
---
Yeahhhh some dungeons already take upwards of 3 hours from advertising group to completion, if you’re intentionally wasting more time you’re going to just get kicked from 90% of groups. Have fun.
---
If you ever leveled a “real” character would you give yourself any kind of gm boost? +exp, good loot, faster regen, etc.
---
I'd say probably not. Back then, it was a cultural phenomenon. Classic is going to be a niche, nostalgia driven experience for the most part. But, who knows. Maybe Dave Chappelle will roll up another Troll Rogue.
---
I agree with you 100%. Im just trying to hazard a guess at what they're thinking. That maybe they dont have enough servers planned at launch to make room for an RPVP slot in each region.
---
Did you played wow as a customer?   
---
  Do you still play?  
---
  If not, why not?
---
Yeah I get what you mean about their 2h swing. I quite like their 1h animations though. Also I disagree about human females, I think their 2h swing is pretty solid although their male counterparts' is better; on the other hand, human females have slightly better 1h animations (both stance and swing) than males imo.
---
Doesn't seem like it.
---
Don't forget, you're going to need fire resist gear for MC and a little for onyxia until you get enough health

If you have time, feel free. I made an album containing not only the originals, but also all of my layer work in case people want to try their hand or you just want to modify the top layer! https://imgur.com/a/NTRqpUy

---
Or even worse. They put up some shadowy mechanics, such as lower miss rate, higher crit rate, more damage, etc, that will make it feel as easy as retail, and then will say:
---
&gt;We'd told you already! You think you do, but you don't!

Art resources for classic content creators ^
---
A few band members played. I remember laughing at one of the guys from Slayer because of a YouTube video where he talked about how gay he thought night elves were and how undead were the best. If it was satire I was too dense to notice, but I just thought it was so stereotypical.
---
Follow up. What are leads?
---
Why didn't you restore that item I accidentally destroyed?
---
Vin Diesel has uploaded videos of him and Paul Walker running through Tanaris together lol

---
you mean, private?
---
There are several tiers of dps. Fury warrior and rogues are S tier. (Or top dps) mages and warlocks are A tier. (Or 2nd best) Where as ret paladins and enhance shamans are C or even D tier. (Bottom of the charts) But really, just play what you think will be fun. Warlocks are always welcome in groups for summons, Soul Stone, and reliable dps!
---
Lead as in lead developer I imagine.
---
They literally can’t go back. If they removed LFR/LFD people would rage. Not to mention they would have to nerf all classes to the ground in order to build them back up again and give a sense of progression.  They do this now with artificial grinds at max level; artifact power and the heart of Azeroth. 
---
The only way to get back to the vanilla feel is to start over and that’s what classic is.  Expansions just add on to the existing universe and by the 9th expansion you can’t really expect to get that same character progression.
---
It boggles my mind that Blizzard wouldn't have at least 1 RP-PVP server. I will be extremely disappointed if there isn't.
---
Your probably right, the point I was trying to make was. If you crossed them, even on accident their giant fan base would essentially black list you on that realm.
---
Imagine merging dead realms of a game less than a year of its release. Lmao, won't happen, blizzard wont do it,
---
What’s sharding? Inb4 it’s when you think it’s just gas but a little poop comes out
---
a joke
---
Hunters volley not viable? Never farmed so no idea
---
thats hilarious. The guys from Slayer might've not even been kidding lol.
---
&gt; We need buttplugs, lots of buttplugs.
---
Whatever floats your boat my dude.
---
0%?  You should pursue a career in meteorology.
---
Kidding, of course.  Still, I like to think there's some glimmer of hope that they'll look back and realize that they've removed a lot of things from the game that inspired players' motivation to improve / earn something.  Maybe not, though.
---
I would say that's not optimal for leveling. Personally I'd recommend leveling with a dagger and shield and use flametongue weapon. For this you wanna have as fast dagger as possible. You also want to get as much spell damage and/or fire spell damage. Flametongue scales for 0.1 x spell damage. So if you have 100 spell damage, your flametongue will deal 10 extra damage every hit. Also the shield gives you a lot of armor and you will take much less damage even though wearing mainly cloth spell damage gear. With this gear you can also heal dungeons with the leveling gear if you don't want to carry another set in your bags.
---
I've leveled 2 shamans to 60 on different private servers and I can assure you it's way more fun than having to rely on the rng of windfury. With WF proc you can sometimes hit a mob for 50% of its health with one hit but there'll be many fights where you won't proc WF at all. Also many of the spell damage items give you int which naturally increases your mana pool and makes you able to sustain yourself a lot more during leveling and reduces the downtime which comes from drinking. With WF and a 2-hander you'll be pretty much oom after 2 mobs but with the flametongue and spell damage gear you'll have very little downtime.
---
Pull a mob with flameshock (or rank 1 lightning bolt if you need the range and want to avoid pulling too many mobs), drop down your searing totem and just auto attack with flametongue weapon. This will melt down the enemies just as fast as WF with 2-hander or even faster and you have to drink way less.
---
I'm torn.
---
On my own, I will want to pve and raid, not too hard core but I like pushing content. These days im around lower mythic raiding. With my friends, we will be dungeoning and pvping. 
---
My group of friends is a rogue,lock, healing priest. I'm thinking of a hunter, shaman, or mage
---
I get where you're coming from but hey, we're still here too, sp why would not some of them return for the game they loved as well. I bet celebrities even more need a place to hide from the real world, and we know there's not a better place for it than Classic \^\^
---
For me, on my hunter main, I farmed black dragon scales the burning Stepps. They sold well and normal dragon scales also sold. The dragonkin dropped coins too, so was fairly lucrative with guilds gearing up for Rags fire res and BWL fire res gear required. 
---
Another place as a skinner was the yetis up in winter spring. Easy rugged leather. Could farm easily 10-20 stacks in an hour. 
---
Another place I liked was the Scarlet Monastery for the cloth drops.
---
Were GM's required to RP when responding to tickets? My limited interactions with them were usually cringe worthy as I spoke like a person playing a game while the GM was all emo.
---
I’d be surprised if Frostadamus doesn’t stream.
---
Its amasing is so many ways.
---
Are you simple? Did you even read that website? Let me help you out by first going over what they regard as being active population:
---
** Population - amount of unique players that meet any of the two conditions:
---
- has a level 110 character that killed something in Tier 20 Heroic Mode
---
- has a level 110 character in a guild that killed something in Tier 20 Heroic Mode*
---
I can only assume those labels were kept there for historical context, but the data there is factual - between half and 2/3 of the people who are playing on a RP realm now are doing so on a historically PvE realm, so unless you're ready to argue that in BfA there was some kind of surge of a couple of tens of thousands new players choosing to go on the former-PvE realm instead of the former-PvP realm, it's safe to assume that those numbers reflect mostly veteran players who have been on those realms before BfA, which proves my point that most of the RP community on retail prefers PvE realms. 
---
I'm sorry I had to explain this slower to you but I hope you get it now. I can pull statistics from other websites if you have difficulty believing that but wowprogress is by far the most accurate because it has a good criteria for what counts as active population.
---
Blizzard takes this stuff really serious.  One of the first things they let you know during GM training is no funny business or abuse of powers.  If they find out a GM has messed with the integrity of the game in any sense they are out of there immediately.
---
In general they don't let brand new GMs even mess with item restorations.  If you did ever ask for an item restoration you probably remember being escalated to a specialist.  These were more experienced GMs who had built up trust and had shown good work over a period of time, and they handled anything regarding item restoration.  I worked as a specialist for awhile and never considered abusing the privilege.  
---
This is 2nd hand but the story did check out.  A girl in my original training allegedly got fired for deleting items from the account of someone she got into a fight with on her server.  I don't understand how you get this reckless, they make it real clear the integrity of the game is sacred to them.
---
Do you know where Mankirk’s wife is?
---
The current retail game looks similar but that is the end of the comparison. Classic feels nothing like retail and that is a very good thing.
---
Barrens chat is 100% worse than vanilla simply because saying horrible shit doesn’t get you banned from private server.
---
Well with the anti cheats blizzard got I don’t recommend account sharing it could be Contra Productive.  
---
The Rank system was crazy what It required to reach  top rank, why because some ppl cheated and account shared then as they went ahead of the curve  they forced more ppl to cheat.   
---
If a rigid system is in place we might see fewer account sharing.  And easier to reach max level.  
---
But I agree the system is super flawed as it only check attendance.
---
What was your favorite wow meme from that era?
---
Private servers usually refer to themselves as vanilla now. There is somewhat of an unofficial consensus about terminology here, where 'classic' is the official blizzard servers.
---
If hell is real you are getting a brand new level all to yourself.
---
Right. I get you're on our side here, sorry if I came across as attacking you. Your thought process is entirely reasonable; my response is more for the benefit of any Blizzard folks who come through here to demonstrate why waiting until after launch, even if just a couple months, really isn't a satisfactory solution to the issue.
---
But what if you reduce regional servers?
---
Technically there always had been high pop servers that were semi over regional, like stormscale for eu pvp players.
---
So basically how this would work, is to offer a set of servers that is not bound to any specific region. This would allow international guilds to persist / form. 
---
Upside is, that there is a shift in where the server pop logs in from at any time of the day, so that you always have people to queue with. They might not be from your region, but they are still your server community, which allows you to form bonds with people during the time when your region is not with you.
---
They downgraded their servers to the ground because no one really plays their game anymore.
---
If the party wipes and a druid somehow survives they're useless because they will not be able to res the party.
---
Do me a favor and ditch out on group runs about halfway through for the dungeons out in the middle of nowhere. Zf, sunken temple, scarlet monastery... These are assuming alliance is what you'll be
---
You also have to remember though getting to max level on WoW takes a good deal of time you have to be really willing to do that much.
---
This was an in game mechanic and as such we as GMs in general didn't step in.  If some how the camping or griefing violated another policy that would be a different story.
---
As a GM we weren't allowed to tell you how to play the game, we could offer you a philosophical outlook though.  If someone were real frustrated I may have said something to the effect of, "you may want to consider taking a 10 minute break and coming back, it might clear your mind... and bore your griefers ;)'  it's on the line enough to where it's giving them some perspective without actually helping them.
---
Just how bad was the BC launch window from the GM side of things?
---
Were you able to influence or participate in any world events as a GM?
---
If/when you had downtime, what were you doing either ingame or IRL?
---
I was 60 druid on nost and 60 paladin on the server after that. This time around going to experience horde. I left myself content to explore. Aq40 and naxx. All the rest I can do with my eyes closed. (And actually have) lol
---
I don’t think they need to announce classic as early as they have other games because they won’t be releasing cd keys or producing boxes to have put in brick and mortar stores. It will literally just be dropped in the blizzard client for us to play and all you’ll have to do is pay the monthly sub to access it.
---
Can you provide some more GM openings you remember? Those were always my favorite.
---
I look forward to Alterac Mountains, many a good memory conducting a Syndicate/Ogre genocide and trying to find a group to help me kill the notorious Baron. Ah good times.
---
&gt; I’m rolling shadow, so I’ll never heal even when it’s needed and I’ll also roll on all caster loot no exceptions, especially the spell crit pieces. Count me in
---
Windfury bot, reporting in.
---
I killed 7 of one of them back in the days on that chain.   Mc/ psychic Scream /mc on the chain (as you could fall off edge feared back then ).  I was on my way out of BRD to hand in a quest when they came from the other way. 
---
Yes you die but if you bring 2+ down with you it’s a win.
---
I'll buy coins just to give him platinum if we get it.
---
The issue here is that to some roleplayers - unexpected PvP doesn't exist. Within the Roleplay community there are handful of differing beliefs.
---
One - the camp i'm a part of have always attempted to drive Roleplay into gameworlds even if there is always risk of conflict between players (pvp). Yes we get mocked etc but we want to bring more flavour to the world at all costs because thats what we enjoy and there should always be risk.
---
Another party - Like to only have what they decide PvP will only happen X etc - they want more control and to not have to think so much outside the box.
---
I believe the later option is what makes Roleplay so toxic for new individuals to make themselves involved in.
---
As well as making themselves walls that push away new players because your not attempting to make those connections first or those connections aren't happening organically.
---
&gt; It's not bad, makes the game pretty social. It forces you to group up and adapt.
---
Also, people are getting much better at waiting in line so that might help.

&gt; Vanilla PvE group content is trivial and mostly simply tank and spank.
---
Spoken like a person who has not raided endgame at 60.
---
I have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Rebalancing classes in Classic is bad because people want to play the game as it was.  Blizzard decided to use 1.12.1 as their platform.
---
Releasing TBC after Classic doesn't affect the "no changes" argument as it relates to Classic...since TBC isn't Classic.
---
Honestly I like LFR and LFD, even though I know what damage they can do to a community.  They're super convenient.  I just want the scaling gone.. but yeah, I see your point, it would probably be harder to remove than it was to add (because non-scaled content actually requires effort to balance).
---
They're very different games.  You're on the classic wow forums which are going to naturally lean towards classic, and the retail forum are still in a bit of an overblown hate bandwagon.  
---
Classic is a traditional mmo.  Classes have well defined roles, different gear for different fights is a thing, and social aspects are high.  The downsides is that combat can be painfully slow, class imbalance can be a big issue, and none of the boss fights are comparable to retail.
---
Retail has the opposite issues.  Combat is much better, but it has largely stripped rpg elements and social aspects in favor of convenience.  
---
Which version you would prefer is entirely up to you as an individual.  Which sounds more fun to you, slowly gathering a party, walking to a dungeon, and slowly working your way through it?  Or teleporting to a dungeon, mass slaughtering everything, and going straight into the next one?
---
No. Usually you accrue during your first year but aren't allowed to use it until you're of probation. That can all vary depending on municipality and MOU, but generally you can't just use your time as you accrue it in your first year.
---
In vanilla wow we had class leaders who know their classes inside out. They can take 1 look at a player and see if they have the gear. Also run a 5 man or so to see how they perform.
---
Damn, I wonder what she got so mad about... 
---
Thanks for your response, very interesting. :-)
---
What do you do now?
---
I had a hunter unironically do all of this on a private server. He was pulling every move in the huntard book before the first boss fight, so I knew he would need on some shit he didn't need. Spell/healing gloves drop that I know our healer needed, I wait to press anything,  he obviously hits need, and I booted his ass from the group before the roll could end.
---
I feel like I might enjoy playing hunter, but having met SO MANY people like this, I can't bring myself to do it.
---
As someone who watched a lot of retail streamers... this doesnt really happen? They dont have hordes of people following them.
---
Oh no, no offense taken. Yeah, I think Blizzard fucked up if they release them after a number of months, and not days or weeks.
---
Playing a shaman:
---
You need a healer? Good news I’m a resto shammy....lol full elemental
---
I heard about that before. I thought it was fake. It just seems very dumb and it creates more work for the artists at Blizzard.
---
Westfall - where you will end up having to grind out at least 2 levels from random mobs because you run out quests.
---
Felicia Day
---
Play a rogue. They ain't camping you when you can get away.
---
RP-PvP ♥️♥️♥️
---
&gt;or you run UBRS a lot.
---
Oh, the joys of unemployment
---
Very interested. Sounds just right, I will follow up in discord later today.
---
West coast, horde, orc fury warrior
---
What did it pay?
---
They're especially bad in deadmines and wailing caverns range. To be fair, for some people it's their first dungeon. What I can't stand is people who ignore advice that's just going to make the run easier for everyone.
---
You’re new to the game, so I’d wait until Classic WoW is released. Get a trial account and see if you like it.
---
If you like it, by all means get a sub $15 and play it like the rest of us. If not, don’t get a sub. If you grow tired of Classic start leveling on the retail side. This game is EXTREMELY different than Classic and you night love or hate it.
---
Do you have any intriguing or memorable stories while helping people in game?
---
Are you familiar with how reserve runs work? Is it set to master looter or do you do group loot and just trust people won't roll on your stuff?
---
What's the best excuse that someone gave for botting?
---
lvl 120 lfr scrub
---
lvl 60 epic raider
---
Lol im just gonna play ret. Nuff said
---
Sure, but a lesser evil is still an evil. Get it out when it's ready, no sooner.
---
Nah. We need an event like this:
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.engadget.com/amp/2014/11/05/wow-archivist-the-zombie-plague-event/
---
Mage is best utility in game God tier control and portals and int.
---
If you're part of a guild clearing Molten Core weekly... it's not uncommon at all unless you have horrible luck.
---
It's kinda a roll of the dice.
---
Eventually, you'll probably be able to get into PUG's that clear it in later phases of Vanilla and get a chance to roll on it if you can get into one of those (assuming you can't find a real raiding guild to take you along).
---
It’s so odd that all the blood elf zones are just, like gone. Lol I haven’t seen a classic map in ages...I may just have to play again.
---
It drops from MajorDomo which is the last boss before Ragneros.  MC should be doable for most raid groups.  When it comes down to it, you might just have to clear it enough times for it to drop.  It took a while before it dropped for my guild then dropped four weeks in a row.
---
Thx for all the effort Josh. I listen to your content during traffic. Is Priest /w Kevin Jordan already done or soon tm?
---
Wow, that's amazing!
---
Did Activision merge with Blizzard during your time in 2008? If so, did you experience any significant changes in the work culture or environment? Not looking for a positive or negative answer, but I would like to know if there was a difference.
---
Never even heard of this one! I blame Google.
---
I always end up at twin-star which seems to be linked to private servers and the comments for items are generally useless. Example: "Quest is working."
---
And what happened to thotbot?
---
Honestly as long as you avoid grouping with them, I don't see a huge issue with it now that i've thought about it more. Plus it pretty much guarantees a high pop server.
---
That's not a great comparison as dark souls has plenty of content that is hard, even if your careful.  I would classify classic as methodical.  Nothing you can be asked to do in the game as an individual is remotely difficult, but it's very easy to die if you're not careful.
---
you know, the first map is really good, but its missing some flightpoints. i wish someone would update it
---
Vendor since she and the croc can drop 2h weapons that go for 5ish g. Also a dagger.
---
We were playing from Brazil :)
---
Wait for servers without sharding and stuff. I'd say nowadays it would be much easier avoid by just getting invited by somebody else on another server to flee the crowd and queueing dungeons to avoid ganks.
---
On a classic server you'd have 24/7 ganksquads on the streamers ass and people defending them. 
---
Something like this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVjUjJqIdTM&amp;t=555s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVjUjJqIdTM&amp;t=555s)  (Forzen and Shroud facing streamsnipers)
---
There are multiple variables however that could have effected the servers in the long run:
---
Fact 1 - they were started later into the games initial launch - Opinion - which could have affected them on the long term.
---
Fact 2 - the new warmode system - Opinion - This could very well be the last nail, it is basically an RP server with a mode to switch to PvP so thusly you might as well move to the bigger RP servers at that point.
---
Fact 3 - Community Degradation -  Opinon - This links well into point 2, the communities have already been degraded over time, those communities may have degraded further than expected though we need to pull full percentages based on retention across time to honestly know.
---
For all you know - which you don't RP-PvP Precursor servers might have a better retention of old players than other servers for example.
---
All you data shows is based on a huge number of variables which makes it not credible data when analysing it against a poll. As you are only looking at raw numbers rather that the actual statistics within those numbers.
---
Oh man I gotta say, I'm not even sure how, I truly thank my lucky stars everything lined up the way it did.  I saw they were looking for Game Masters on the Blizzard.com webpage.  I put together a resume with anything on it I thought may be relevant and submitted it.  I am not even sure I heard back the first time, but I just kept sending it in every couple weeks, eventually I got an e-mail back.
---
They had me interview at Blizzard HQ in Irvine.  If this all that ever became of it I still think it would have been awesome.  They interviewed me in a conference room, asked about previous work experience, experience in WoW and in other MMOs and all that.  I made an instant connection with the interviewers because I had been a hardcore EQ player and they had played as well.  The impression I got from the interview was they were looking for passionate players who wanted to be a part of something special.  A week later I was emailed an invite to join their GM training.
---
Lol seems im blind and pleasantly surprised
---
gonna be a healer, but never bring water
---
just /sit and wait for mana regen
---
&gt;People thinking this is a lot of consumables should stay far away from Classic
---
That's not elitist at all /s
---
&gt;**mandatory** consumables
---
DEFINITELY not elitist. 
---
&gt;WANT to play Ret.
---
I'm sure you despise the "elitists" who tell you not to.
---
If it's really only 15 gold for all that come classic, good luck and I hope it becomes a thing.
---
Do you any favorite stories about regulars who constantly submitted tickets or who constantly got reported?
---
Like characters who felt a duty to act as the Azeroth neighborhood watch? Or town drunk types who ended up in the slammer every night?
---
Thanks!
---
I nearly moved to Texas during the split.  Had I moved I may still be working there today, a lot of my friends went and they loved it.
---
Then look at fights like Coven from legion or Kil'jaeden (both mythic)  from legion, those fights have more mechanics on their own than all the bosses you mentioned combined.
---
I'd 100% play that undead model if it was an option. I never knew why i have no knee or elbos skin but still have feet.
---
she has a great personality
---
I think the reason is that "RP" is literally made up in the sense that everyone is playing pretend, something that is rather hard to support from a technical standpoint beyond enforcing proper names and behavior, which in itself causes a lot of ticket traffic and needs dedicated personal to take care of.
---
Yes, i did raid. But you have just cherry picked those few encounters that are not tank and spank which at all does not refute my point that it is MOSTLY tank and spank. Look, I love vanilla, but to say that modern raids are easier than raids back then is ludicrous.
---
How many(percentage) people complained to you about the game? How many of your encounters with players was "negative"?
---
I made over 100g/h from my herb gathering but I did alarm clock it to 05:00 in the morning when I was alone at my favourite nodes.  
---
Play for 1h,
---
Eat breakfast, 
---
Go to work
---
It’s an edge case I know. 
---
(And no I didn’t sell my black lotus).  You get very popular when you can hand out flasks to tanks to make that hard raidboss.
---
&gt;a Game Master and make $13 an hour!
---
I'd rather imagine it as 3$ an hour. Not sure about your country, but in mine, such types of jobs were paid hardly more than street cleaning.
---
&gt;Classic is going to be a niche, nostalgia driven experience for the most part.
---
It's most likely going to be more popular than the main game given how low sub counts have fallen. There's more hype around classic than there has been for a WoW release in a very, very long time. I honestly can't remember the last time there was this much excitement over anything to do with World of Warcraft.
---
Gotta agree! I got to Marshal playing a hunter with PVE raid spec and gear. The Xbox from BWL was so overpowered in BGs. I didn’t have to respec at all.
---
A LEGEND!
---
Because you have boots.
---
I'd be pumped if my death triggered such a legendary event. I'd rather be alive, but still
---
&gt;wanted to go to the movies with friends, so I sold 100g to china famers
---
wait, was that enough? Where in the hell did you live, so they have such cheap tickets?
---
It was so common that I got mine because another guild that was running MC for Tier 2 (that my guildmaster knew people in) had given the Priest/Hunter items to all their members, so they just handed it out. I waited at the entrance with a Hunter guildmate, and the Eye dropped, so I was summoned in to loot it. 
---
If you make a Priest and get to 60, you'll end up with Benediction without much effort.
---
Alright my dudes. My journey in Azeroth began around 2006 when I was a little dude. I started off playing an undead rogue and never managed to hit max during Vanilla. I was always jealous of hunters getting their own pets so I re-rolled in TBC. I played hunter almost exclusively until the start of MoP and then quit the game. When classic roles around a LARGE part of me wants to keep playing hunter since Vanilla hunter seems so different from WoTLK/Cata (the x-packs I did end-game content). 
---
**I want a great leveling experience** (since now I'm in college/building a career so I may never hit 60) **and to wreck in world PvP/BG's.** 
---
I'm choosing between Hunter, Warlock, Rogue, and Druid (in that order for the most part). I'll probably pick 1 main and 1 alt from those classes.
---
Horde or alliance.. I've played both, which demographic will be better this time? I feel like ally us gonna be more minmax hardcore raiders
---
You were a twink, and there are very few buttons at level 19.  Nax took a huge amount of time invested, but there wasnt a single boss fight that was mechanically difficult.  5 man's in modern WoW have more mechanics than most raid bosses did in vanilla.  Mythic raiding is far harder now than nax was in classic.
---
Yes. Cause summer
---
Unzip. Instant cast. 6 and a half inch range.
---
sweet, sounds good. if you have any questions just let me know. we are just slowly adding people up until classic.
---
Except you can't - this has been stated regularly - it is to maintain an atmosphere within the community and to minimise immersion breaking interactions.
---
Which you will never eliminate but there is at least reduction.
---
I am not sure who that was specifically, but I imagine we got the email
---
"[Guy who gave out green mechanostriders] is no longer an employee of Blizzard Entertainment."
---
anal \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]
---
Looks like Un'Goro and Silithis for sure. Any others that are missing? Looks pretty complete to me aside from those.
---
What was the the weirdest or funniest ticket you've ever had to respond to?
---
Haha maybe!!  
---
I banned A LOT of those gold farmers, and you didn't want to get mixed up into a chain of them because we didn't know whose of those accounts had been hacked and claimed by them.
---
Wait for Classic!
---
Did the GM's ever give or get info on development? Could you have sent ideas for a class or a boss, or even have input on what is or isn't working within the game?
---
We don't care about sharding anymore, it's all about release dates!
---
Zg act a filler 
---
They give struggling guilds gear so they can reach further in mc.  Example say that your struggling on Boss4 in Mc you get down 3 bosses so you realistically get gear for say 10-12ppl /week 
---
By adding zg you get another batch of good gear for your guild.  
---
Aq20 (except first boss) is harder then mc imho.  
---
Additionally 
---
Zg have more fun mechanics then Mc  as it’s mostly a spank tank and decurse fights.  
---
-you could skip the bosses to fight a insanely hard Hakkar 
---
- blood lord who levels up of he kills anyone.  
---
- spider boss adds who becomes stronger the longer they live.  
---
-jindo and his mechanics 
---
- summoning demon bosses 4 different
---
I played through all of vanilla and BC at a Max of 12 fps. That's why I just started playing healers. I could zoom in all the way and stare at healthbars instead of models and it gave me better performance lol.
---
Very cool.  We need more fury warriors!!
---
Can´t wait to level 55-60 in Moonglade. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
If PvP, probably Horde. End game raiding is favored for Alliance.
---
What is something that most people didn't know that the GM took care of?
---
You should do loch modan and westfall, plenty of quests.
---
On purpose... yeah
---
&gt;Except you can't - this has been stated regularly - it is to maintain an atmosphere within the community and to minimise immersion breaking interactions.
---
I am fully aware of that, thats what i mean with the "play pretend". it only works if everyone does it, but you try explaining that to a corporate CEO whos only gaming experience was tetris in 1991. That guy has to greenlit the additional resources. 
---
I think we should absolutely have these servers, but dont forget you still have to reach the upper echelons of blizzard to get additional servers reserved.
---
I love Stranglethorn (I never played on a PVP realm), I think the highest I got in vanilla was level 43 so it was the last zone I’d hit. So much atmosphere! I was a rogue and I enjoyed stealthing around the stealthed panthers. 
---
In WotLK I finally got to Tanaris and Ungoro and I loved those too. I had a hunter at that point and they were so remote, so it truly felt like my cat and I were alone in the world.
---
I recall the day that some GM banned everyone inside MoonGuard Goldshire inn. 
---
Including random questers. That wave of complaints...
---
Often many people were complaining about GMs using pre-written default templates when they answered tickets. Was this a thing?
---
Race will never ever matter, even in a sweaty minmaxer pserver guild.
---
Even meme specs like Ret Paladin or Moonkin can make it in tryhard guilds, you just have to join the guild early, be liked in the guild, and come to raids overprepared.
---
How effective were combat rogues during leveling? Could you sustain a relative amount of damage/fight multiple mobs without blowing all your pots?
---
I was the first in my guild to get this.  I made sure my DKP was always slightly above everyone else when this dropped.  The quest was kinda fun and out of the ordinary.  Best of luck!
---
Haha, I have shared this one in a couple other threads but I love this story.
---
I was roommates with another GM for awhile, and they were a total goofball.  They actually hung around comedy clubs and was pretty much always joking around.  Anyways, once they were asked, "What happens when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object" to which they replied "Chuck Norris Dies".  It became WoW forum joke for awhile.
---
Anyways I knew about the joke but never actually looked at the SS, months later a common friend of ours who used to be on our team was like, 'OMG wasn't that hilarious that your roommate said that?'  I had no idea, I rushed to the WoW forums looked at the SS and sure enough there was their GM name, I died.
---
you crash
---
You, not the Shout.
---
Did you ever ban people ? If so what is your most memorable episode?
---
I feel like mechanics get more and more over the top to combat the sophistication of addons.
---
In customer service Lead is short for Team Lead, usually anywhere between a senior agent and a manager
---
Which zones are PvP?
---
Seamus.... get the Azerite...
---
Cannibal Corpse :P
---
What were some cool spells only GMs had?
---
Duel welding bone slicing hatchets. BiS for hunters pre raid. Ran stratholme countless times.
---
cool AMA. Thank you.
---
I want to agree, but as intensely as I am involved in this scene(and I suspect you might be too) I gotta admit we are a little biased to evaluate how much hype there is actually in numbers. It could be big, it could be niche or it could be huge, I honestly cant tell yet, if I try to be objective.
---
Race will never matter, even for a tryhard minmaxer pserver guild.
---
Coming to raids consistently, being prepared with consumes, taking leadership roles, helping guildmates with tasks outside of the raid. Those are the things that matter to a raid leader a thousand times more than sword/axe specialization, which is a miniscule raid DPS increase.
---
Pretty common. My first real raiding guild had the Eye drop from Domo two weeks in a row, and I'm pretty sure we got a third within a few months of that.   
---
For the Eye of Shadow, hook up with a Warlock farming Blasted Lands for the Grimoire of Doom. The demons there can drop both, and aren't terribly difficult if you're duoing them.
---
Retail and classic are two completely different games.  You can’t even really compare them.
---
Chat in general was pretty much player policed.  The general idea is if something is that bad it gets reported and we have the logs to verify whatever gets said.  As bad as Barrens chat gets, there is just so many things being said so many places across the servers you couldn't ever monitor one place efficiently.
---
The dungeon where they replaced everything with bread is also dope lol.
---
No PVP zone entrances - could alliance queue outside of major cities? I never played alliance at the time.
---
Or the pieces of information you discover during crime investigation.
---
But, I guess that wouldn't cure players.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
What is it about back country, rural areas that attract that kind of thing? I hear West Virginia suffers from a lot of the same problems.
---
Yeah, it was 1.9 😄
---
My F5 is already getting sticky. Where is it?
---
Do you still have a livetime sub to WoW?
---
Once you go Classic you never go Bassic
---
We swore all the time without issue. I believe thats what the profanity filter was for.
---
You won't have to! There will be plenty doing that naturally, blissfully unaware
---
Were there conquences for showing up in game and doing something such as /flex or /laugh at a player or just kind of messing with a player? Heard many stories of GM's showing their in game character and doing funny stuff.
---
For example: I remember this video from a raid in ICC. The GM showed up and was playing around with players. [Link to video.](https://youtu.be/arwS7fMCq28)
---
Fugg I want both
---
Haha GM island is actually a really boring place.
---
Literally nothing goes on there and it's just a bunch of GM avatars standing around, many of which don't even have gear on.
---
The real GM island was in the break room playing Super Smash Brothers and Foosball.  ;)
---
In terms of exploring yeah.  People get themselves caught in the cookie jar trying to get places they aren't supposed to be and then have to get us to dig them out.  As long as it wasn't game breaking it was mostly no harm no foul but don't keep doing that please...
---
Now if you were spinning that into some way to exploit the game mechanics... different story.
---
Vanilla and Retail are difficult in different ways.
---
Vanilla is difficult in the way of requiring a good group comp, good gear, consumes, strategy, good players with proper talent specs, etc.
---
Retail is difficult in the way of making you memorize 10 different mechanics on every single boss fight and is more focused on that kind of "action" aspect.
---
This is a game I want to play. Where do I sub?
---
Man imagine if karazhan and battle for hyjal were in classic like they were intended be.
---
If you think it’s ‘social’ levelling in a zone with 300 people there’s really not much to say. Chat will just be a constant stream of garbage, groups will be spam invites with no conversation and most quests will be completely ignored. You would be far more likely to make friends on a sharded zone with 50 people where you might have to actually organise a group for something not just spam invite everyone within 30yards for a constant group of 5 people.
---
Which is why people are following what blizzard's cm's suggested and that was make noise.
---
Chuck Norris Dies ;)
---
Are GM's compensated for their time!?  Will they be in Classic?
---
Please tell me a story of the best ticket you ever responded to.
---
Split the difference and go ret
---
Did you all hang out on a GM island, and if so did you just jump around in circles while waiting like we all did in IF?
---
Thorium Point (AH), Morgan's Vigil (A), Flame Crest (H)
---
Are there any interesting changes to how you worked or what you were allowed to handle within a GM's remit ? 
---
Supposedly I heard they changed it from being an Ingame function to a backend type system or something at some point ?
---
How often did GMs punish players, when they clearly in the right of rule sets like a PvP. Aka put their personally feelings first. Thanks!
---
I know this, wasn't sure what context op was using it in.
---
I remember former Blizzard CM Ythisens saying something along the lines of modern GMs not being restricted to a specific Blizzard game (say, Overwatch or WoW). They'd answer tickets and solve problems for customers of all Blizzard games.
---
I assume this wasn't the case in Vanilla. Were you still employed when this switch happened? What kind of implications do you think does this have with the quality of customer support, do you see any problems with this system in general?
---
It will be impossible to get there without wall jumping.
---
Leveling a priest is wanding 101 you use some spells but with talents you want to stay I 5sr as long as possible. 
---
From a pvp perspective depending on if your ud or not  and also depends on who jumps who 9/10 the attacker wins at lowlevel due to low hp. 
---
If you get jumped by a rogue and he starts to stunlock you you will be at very low hp when you get a psychic scream off this will often lead to you losing.  
---
If you start the fight remember you got a lot of tools to your disposal. Dots will tick so fearing and mc is valid tactics.   (Yes if you got the mana you can dot and mc and create a distance to you so you can continues to kit dot.  If UD double dot and look at your empty mana bar.  /s
---
Great question!  I don't exactly remember why, but for some reason this one really stood out.
---
I remember helping someone who was having an issue completing a quest, it actually ended up being more than 1 issue I was unpacking it, they were doing several things "incorrect" but technically the game was functioning properly.
---
After giving them a run down of the fixes and sorting through the various issues we got to the final one, which was his quest item was in the bank.  A GM can't tell you the quest item is the bank, but I can give you hints that may help YOU figure out it's in the bank.  They were not picking up these hints, so I kept offering them and eventually it clicked.  The ticket all things told took an hour but they were seriously SO appreciative, definitely made it worth it to me.
---
"Hmmm i wonder what i will find east of undercity, OH GOD ITS A BEA-" last words of many hordes.
---
I think you'd be much better off waiting for Classic, the new player experience in Battle for Azeroth is pretty awful. Leveling is as mindnumbing as it gets, the world is bloated and incohesive, most specs just barely come into their own at level 90+, and there's no real player or class identity. It's a lonely and empty experience until you reach level 120 and can start playing the 'real' game (which at the moment, has been in turmoil for months now thanks to the latest expansion catastrophically failing almost instantly)
---
If you're in the market for an MMO or RPG, the current state of live Wow is far from either.  It's an end-game focused theme park at its core. I might come off as harsh, I still like live Wow, but for someone without a lay of the land, it is far from a magical experience in its current state. Classic would be a much better game for a new player, that's my take. Cheers
---
Maybe because nobody reported you. The one guy who kept spamming chat about that ban, was hated by tthe entire server
---
Plottwist: the summoning portal is a portal to a city.
---
fuuuuuuuuuck Desla
---
Always incorporate Multi Shot into your rotation. Even if you are clipping your auto attack and ESPECIALLY if it will break a sheeped mob.
---
I hope this is still doable in Classic. A MMO-RPG is just more fun if you can Troll others. Or at least they make it available for a week just for the fun. Also Hakka-Debuff... PLS Make it for a short time available!!!
---
1. Was there any punishment for doing the silly GM things like spawning stuff in org or ganking players or spawning in a dungeon to help kill-off a boss?
---
2. What was your most common ticket that you despised answering?
---
Haha, do you trust people? Never.  Just form the group yourself and while you're shouting include what items are reserved.  Then yes, you master loot the boss fights.
---
Once a week, they might not want you in at the very start so they can get a full 40 to run multiple attempts multiple days that week. Once they have it on farm though they'll clear it in one go no problem. Pretty sure every priest/hunter in my raid group had their epic quest weapon though.
---
I'm sure the travel points are just as weird &amp; annoying as WoW
---
oh sorry, if you were asking for quest info, yeah those sites would be best. But barrens.chat has a lot of guides, icon assets, etc...
---
It likely won’t be a huge problem because server cap will be much less than private servers. So maybe 2 shards and any everyone else waits in a queue. End of conversation.
---
Nah. We want vanilla. Not vanilla+. You might get bored but then you can fuck off back to retail. Tourist.
---
Was playing the game during work hours encouraged?
---
Could you sit and just fish while messaging customers?
---
Too many ret paladins gear like warriors and think spell power is bad and end up doing poorly because of it. I wish I could find the forum thread but the ret paladins who geared with spell damage in mind did more dps than those who just geared for attack power.
---
What did the Gm character UI look like when you logged in?  Did the skills you could do like teleport have tooltips? Did you do things via text command? Did you have your own character in the world that you could change the look of?
---
Gilneas looks like the angry Arthur fist meme.

Love this video, favorite part is the mounted assault starting at 3:16. Riding towards a goal with my guild all around me is the best feeling.
---
Damn, that must have been awesome at the time. I didnt turn 18 until 2007, but at the time I would have done anything to have the chance to work for Blizzard in some fashion back then.
---
What was the most memorable gaming moment you witnessed during your time as a GM?
---
I tend to look at Classicdb.ch
---
Quite similar to wowhead.
---
Community: A lot of people follow streamers just to follow them around to hopefully be noticed. A lot of them might not care about vanilla so things could potentially be far more toxic than normal.
---
Faction Imbalance: People will follow their streamer to their faction. It can easily change server populations. We've seen this on retail before already.
---
Server Events: Things like AQ gates opening could be a lot different with streamers. I am not entirely certain if this will be good or bad yet though.
---
I agree. The coolest part of the Onyxia quest line is that you start without even knowing what it will lead up to.
---
Previous threads talking about this haha. Dude this has been something that has been talked about for 15 years now since the game has been released. People are probably not talking about it because most of the community has been aware of this for years now.
---
Going to chime in and say that this thread was just made recently, and while I support RP servers and played on one in Vanilla (actually, Moonguard was a normal pve-rp server--a super populated server), I have to disagree with some viewpoints here:
---
First, that community was known for its ERP. Is that what you mean by mature community? Asking, because I genuinely don't know why you say mature audiences are attracted to RP servers. In my observances, having played on various types of realms in Vanilla, there was no such thing as a mature community as a whole. You will always find assholes in every community; that's why you form guilds of like-minded people and ignore those who piss you off. I'd rather ask Blizz to moderate world chat and enforce no hate speech/racism/etc. 
---
Secondly, I'm concerned about the fact that there is so much demand for niche realms. I want my own niche group as do hundreds of others as well: a normal server in our time zone so that we don't miss out on raiding because we don't get home in time for when a guild raids on EST. I just don't know if the population of Classic will support all our niche demands and I'd rather wait and see before determining that there are truly the numbers for niche interests.
---
Finally, I don't think this reddit is truly representative of who will be playing Vanilla. I know hundreds from a couple guilds on private servers who stay away from Reddit completely because of the cliques who organize vote brigades, which is sad but happens; in fact, despite your call for a mature community, anyone at all who has posted in this thread with opposing but rational views gets downvoted. I know that I will too and still want to voice a different opinion.
---
Dont play private servers if you've never played it before.  You have the rare opportunity to see it through the eyes that some of us did back in 2004.  Do your reading, theory crafting, imagining, but do not spoil the experience with a private server.
---
tHeRe's nOt EnOuGh QuEsTs To HiT 6o
---
I saw the job listing on Blizzard.com, put together a resume and kept sending it in until I heard back.
---
You work in the Blizzard office, game security is very tight, so working from home could really jeopardize that integrity.  
---
Pay was really good for entry level at the time I thought.  You started as a temp employee at $10 an hour and $12 when full time with benefits and a yearly raise.  After a couple small promotions and yearly raises I worked my way up to $15 before I changed jobs.
---
This one is hard to say, because it depends on your viewpoint, but I would say the most serious offenses were cheating with 3rd party programs and gold spamming which got pretty abusive sometimes.  When you ban enough gold spammer accounts they make retaliation accounts.
---
When it comes to things people say to each other it gets real bad sometimes.  There are some things people say that are so horrible it warrants getting them out right away and a long break to rethink how they play the game.  In my opinion these are the worst.
---
Nice, I have heard a lot of good things about that server. Hope you have a good time in vanilla!
---
Did you ever use that weird white room on gm island for anything?
---
1. They didn’t have access to those commands.

---
What rotation leveling do you use?
---
Shield pre fight, mindblast, swp, wand wand wand 
---
Shield pre fight, smite , swp, wand wand wand.  
---
Mindflay is good as a filler if your high on mana but wanding is how you sped your time.  
---
The key is having full life / 80+ mana so you can continue grinding without ever drinking.  It also discourage gankers as your high health/mana means you fight back.
---
? Thanks for contributing mate.
---
Had something like that happen where I wall jumped my way under storm wind and jumped into an un textured hole...I was falling forever and I couldnt log out or hearth. Had to contact a GM to port me out, and he told me to stop jumping into holes :P
---
That's wrong. With rocket boots, slow fall, fear, charge, sheep, blink and probably even more game mechanics you can get everywhere.
---
Again, context is important.  It might seem great from a technical standpoint, but servers want to be as isolated as possible.  Just as they were in vanilla.  That means holding off on cross-realm is probably the correct decision.

[Henry Cavil \(Superman\)](https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/2/11353442/henry-cavill-was-too-busy-playing-warcraft-to-answer-a-call-to-play) played WoW a lot.
---
do u have the link to said video?
---
Had a fucker come up and loot a chest just as killed all the mobs surrounding it.
---
Shit, had a bitch come up and kill that last raptor in STV. There were 5 of them clustered together and I was slowly clearing that spot. She comes up, tags it, and kills it. Then skins it.
---
I see her 5 minutes later killing raptors and skin one of her kills.
---
Server cap 5k. 2.5k Alliance split between 3 zones. Likely 60% human so 1.5k players in Northshire.  If they have 10 shards then you will log in and see 150 people. Those people will then gradually move out of Northshire into elwynn which would likely be another shard or 2 and then that will probably be the end of sharding.  
---
Why don’t we just let Blizzard worry about the technical stuff.
---
This might just be me, but worgen made me hate all flipping animations. Even troll spinning animations became annoying.
---
&gt; But you have just cherry picked those few encounters that are not tank and spank
---
Molten Core has 10 bosses. Of the ten, only Magmadar, Garr and Golemagg can be considered tank and spank. I will toss Ragnaros in there as a freebie. So 4 of 10 in MC. Not a tank and spank majority.
---
BWL has 8 bosses. Only two can be considered "tank and spank", Vaelstraz and Broodlord. You *might* be able to throw Flamegor in there too... So at most 3 of 8. Not tank and spank majority.
---
ZG has 10 bosses at a time, but has an encounter that could be 1 of 4 bosses, so 14 bosses in total. Only one of them can be even remotely counted as a tank and spank, and thats the fish boss Gazranka. Very far from a tank and spank majority. 
---
AQ20 has 6 bosses. Two of them can be considered "tank and spank", Kurinax and Moam... But again Moam is a stretch. So 2 of 6, and not even a contender for tank and spank majority. 
---
AQ40 has 9 bosses. Satura and Frankriss are close to a "tanka and spank". Ill even toss in Huhuran even though shes not. 3 of 9 is not a majority last time I checked.
---
And then theres Naxx with its 15 bosses and the most famous tank and spank of all time: Patchwerk. Literally nothing else in the raid is a tank and spank, some things are as far as possible from that as they could be like Lotheb... Candidate of the centurty for not tank and spank.
---
Its almost like most of the bosses are NOT tank and spank!
---
I only heard about it a year or so ago when that video came out, I haven't played since TBC. And since there don't seem to be any other threads on this sub talking about it, thought it'd be cool to share for anyone else interested.
---
I cannot wait to hear complaints about Quality of Life.
---
I'm genuinely excited to hear the cries of confusion so I can bask in the greatness of Vanilla with a grin on my face.
---
I always used to fap to this painting.
---
https://youtu.be/N3s14rBD-2s
---
It's in the first few minutes.
---
I agree, I think they had their hands way too far in the cookie jar with BfA. The grind'll always be a part of an MMO but the current state of the game is just something else. I just hope it's all a sobering experience for Blizz.
---
Thank you for your kindness! This is exactly what the community wants.
---
"Pass lead so I can boot this guy."
---
2 minutes later:
---
"Pass lead."
---
"Dude, pass lead."
---
"Oh, you're talking to me? How do you do that?"
---
Did you ever catch someone "fooling the game" in some clever way? Like someone abusing some kind of mechanic. I remember a guild that managed to hack into the walls of AQ 40 and go straight to C'thun.
---
Careful with those words... Yeh might startle the trolls.
---
My hype is erect
---
Updated!
---
We wanted a blue post and they gave us a Beta.
---
It was basically detention.  Generally players would be kicked out of the game, but occasionally you needed to speak to them without giving them the ability to run around and continue doing what they got reported for before their cool off period began.
---
Lack of jobs, money, education, experiences.
---
I'M SO HYPED
---
Updated
---
!remind me 4 hours
---
Every Priest had it. The quest was not actually difficult at all, even a mediocre Priest would only take a few tries to beat it. If you were in a guild raiding MC, you could get Benediction easily, since the Eye of Divinity dropped 50% of the time from domo.
---
Do you know when the release date is? /s

Graphics suck, subscription price too high would definitely uninstall.

Well u came yo wow classic forum where its packed with vanilla wow fanboys so your going to get yhis impression. Vanilla may be better than current retail but it has plenty of its own issues. Its got pooor as fuck itemization for roughly half the content and a terrible pvp system that rewards time played over skill. And the anouny of time and effort you will spend just farming to afford consumables for any serious raiding is game crippling if ur constrained on game time. Ive picked it up again and cleared aq40 and by time naxx was about to come out i didnt even want to do naxx progression because it cost way more than aq40 to just have consumables necesary to progress through it. That and aq40 was a pretty boring raid some cool bosses but trash and scenery were very stale. Many specs were trash so thise hybrid classes u think can fill multiple roles can really only do 1 and ur stuck with that. I honestly think tbc was the sweet spot for wow
---
What does Content Delivery Network entail? Is it a schedule/rollout of some sort or?
---
And if so.. what is the usual time till its announced/arrived after that?
---
Hi, /u/MrGM_
---
This is what WoW will look like by the time they release the final expansion.
---
If my experience on private servers is any indication there will be plenty of noobs.
---
WE BACK BOYS
---
It’ll only take 45 min to find a replacement and have them run to the instance.
---
This is my question exactly.
---
He came up on my feed. All that dude does is read shit and make commentary for the sake of making a Youtube video.
---
Great news, now let’s get some dates on the calendar
---
Did you live in California or did Blizzard fly you out to work the Blizzcons?
---
Essentially: it's been put on their download servers for mass download at some point soon.
---
Itemization.info is useful if you know the name of the item you want.
---
Will you be playing Classic WoW?
---
&gt;Plus it pretty much guarantees a high pop server.
---
That part not so much. Depends on the streamer of course but say a signficant part of the server consist of viewers, if the streamer quits and the viewers follow, you can go from a healthy to a not so healthy pop.
---
revving up the mother fucking hype engine
---
would have been more hyped if there wouldnt be a beta tbh but alright
---
Hehe funny, we just killed Nefarian literally seconds ago and guess what dropped.. the fucking Lok'amir! Unfortunately the SP was away so a paladin got his holy paws on it. But omg that is a pretty weapon and fits very well on a paladin.
---
You will easily be able to go from Classic to Live.  However, if you start on Live, you’ll likely become too accustomed to convenience that you will find Classic too cumbersome.  To try both, start with Classic.
---
Sharding is probably the only thing that will make the game playable at launch. I don't think people understand how crazy it's going to be. Imagine trying to do almost any quest when you have 20 people around you racing to tag mobs before anyone else can. Even in retail it can be frustrating camping a quest objective waiting for your turn to complete it. Multiply that by 100 and you will have the first week of an unsharded vanilla.
---
As a GM the ZG plague day was probably the most unique.
---
The AQ Gates opening was a cool day on the GM floor cause we were all working but also kinda keeping an eye on it to see what we could.
---
For the most part though there were so many tickets we were 100% focused on helping you guys enjoy the game while we were in Game Master mode.  A good deal of us though were logging in pretty much the moment we clocked out and playing with the rest of you as normal players too!
---
Very nice!
---
It did drop T2.
---
The helm and legs from T2 were out immediately. They had placeholder models but they were out.
---
It's happening. everybody stay calm!
---
Same but with earthshock.
---
Aaaah very interesting.. so its basically the stage before PTR/Betas in that sense? The Alpha before Beta?
---
I’ll still play my best, but I won’t be pushing for speed runs, or getting on people for threat issues. I know I’ve got a lot of experience in 1.12, pservers, and pre Cata wow in general (old world is burned into my mind) but most people I’ll play with, at least 1-60, won’t. 
---
I won’t demand others wear min max gear or spec perfectly. I don’t care if my raid knows the strats or has to wipe and progress a bit (I’d sorts prefer it tbh, raiding is only fun when it’s hard, new, and you’re learning as a team (this is why live progression is so much fun when you’re keeping pace and only 1-2 bosses behind method, as competitive as I was for front page wowprogress, just being in the realm where YouTube can’t help is great). In 5 man’s I hope I play with people who don’t know of all the skips. 
---
Min maxing is great when it comes to your performance as an individual, do as much damage as possible, react to incoming threats perfectly. But “min maxing” the game world, to me, is a thin veil for exploitive behavior.
---
Did you play WOW outside of work? If so, how many hours a week did you spend logged in?
---
FETCH ME MY MEME STRETCHER
---
I just wish karazhan was in classic like it was intended to be
---
We need Kazzak outside ironforge shooting skulls and one shotting everybody.
---
I mained a resto druid in vanilla, this brought back some memories.  I can recall being the only one alive in parts of Dire Maul and having to wait 15 minutes for the group to run back.
---
Level enhancement shaman  the burst of windfurry is insane.  Not to mention imp ghost wolf.   
---
Leveling a feral Druid comparison 
---
Druids are faster (get catform with speed bonus earlier) and travelform as shaman gets there gw.  
---
Druids are more reactive while shamans are more bursty leveling.  
---
Both can standup to a gank.  
---
Caster druids are weaker then ferals. Same with elemental shamans.  You need to work harder to make your raidspot then rolling Restro Derivate by then.
---
Thank you and hopefully recording this weekend :)
---
Hnnnnggggg can not wait for this.
---
Whenever a PTR hits the CDN for retail it becomes accessible within 2-3 weeks tops, usually one week later on reset
---
Man i would love an example of this, do you remember any situations where you or other gms locked players up in a room to be able to communicate with them, fully constraint?
---
Legs of T2 dropped off Rags and Ony dropped the helm of T2 in vanilla.
---
*Smashes vending machine with chair*
---
The part from major domo drops at a 50% chance. Do MC for a couple of months and you a guaranteed that part. Then you just need to buy an eye for like 100-200g on AH, and complete the quest part, which if you know the correct tactic/spec it's quite easy and you can nail it first or 2nd try.
---
Do you realize how powerful these consumables truly are? If someone dont want to use them I am more than happy to guildinvite one of the 500 other dps on the server who dont think farming 15g for pots every week is too much to ask.
---
It's not about if you CAN clear the content without them or not. Using them just shows you care about something other than getting loot for minimum effort, and that you are willing to contribute and be part of a team.
---
Almost no guild would be willing to bring players who dont care about enchanting their gear, and consumables are really no different than that. It shows you give a shit and thats more important than anything else in Vanilla.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but ERP has always been a notable problem on RP realms, not RP-PvP (aside from the exceptional weirdo here n there). So that's basically another argument pro RP-PvP, no?
---
I really don't see what rp-pvp has to do with your niche raiding times? There's plenty of options you can choose from already on the Guild Discord, I'm sure you'll find something that fits your schedule.
---
Reversely people on this subreddit may also stay away from private servers. I don't understand what you're trying to argue; only people from this subreddit want RP-PvP? I respect opposing views, I'm not asking everyone to all of a sudden love RP-PvP. Those that argue against RP-PvP most of the time have some form of animosity towards us. If you don't care, just move on and enjoy your pvp-realm.
---
Yes, because you absolutely NEED five people for 5mans or else you have no possible chance of clearing it.
---
Cant wait!!!!!
---
Very interesting. Thanks a lot! So 2-3 weeks till beta then :D
---
This hauntingly, ptsd-inducing music gives me chills.
---
We knew about a few of the "unfinished" parts of the world -- the incomplete [Caverns of Time in Tanaris](https://youtu.be/C2h3PEU1EVU?t=152) comes to mind, as well as the [Endless-Pale-Void](https://youtu.be/VngW_LwqjIs?t=147) (with the weird little island of Outland-like stuff) that you could get to by blinking back out the instance portal while in the Deadmines. Were there any that we didn't discover?  What's your favorite "secret" spot in the old Classic WoW world?
---
Simply remove the automatic variant and stick with the group finder or encourage a universal world chat.
---
Yep, Tauren because of the Tauren with the 2H Totem weapon. I was lied to.
---
It's only free to 18.
---
Definitely 2nd Barrens Chat
---
Oh so you're one of those hardcore gamer that binds sit and knows that sitting regen mana faster ? 
---
Not noob enough :o
---
&gt;Its an old game.  Absolutely no need for a beta
---
No. It is an old game being PORTED to another engine. It's not even a remaster or HD edition, it's a port in its deepest meaning.
---
But, since they copy-paste tons of data and code, there is greater need for testing, than for actual development. Just look at the great bug list thread, that appeared during the demo. It would take minutes to fix most of them, while it took long hours to notice them. Take the kiting, for example, or lack of weather effects.
---
This is a Grand Majestic post on this Reddit forum!
---
It's usually followed fairly quickly with a PTR on retail, I'd expect an announcement this week and maybe the beta starting next week.
---
Cant wait to start clicking again
---
I’d prefer no sharding at all because I appreciate the madness that is a wow launch, but with sharding in the first zone or two the noobs that check out classic at launch to see what the hype is about are a lot more likely to stick around to give classic a shot. 
---
I reckon someone that’s only played retail in recent years/hasn’t played wow at all would not have a very good first impression from not being able to get any mob tags or basically play at all. 
---
All the hardcore fans (aka us) will play regardless if there is sharding in early zones or not but the same might not be said for the newbies.
---
I could see sharding being in place for the first two zones for each race but not beyond that since it will take most people so long to get to ~20. The hardcore players will blast through the sharded zones in half a day and will be competing with one another in the rest of Azeroth while the casuals will have a nice and peaceful experience and trickle into the unsharded zones.. at least in theory hehe
---
big assets.
---
Though fewer exist today, there were quite a few people who impersonated GMs or Blizzard themselves, under names like \[Blízzárd\]. Were there any interesting moments dealing with those impersonators?
---
What was the most pathetic/funny excuse given to you by someone who was breaking a rule or otherwise?
---
I'm checking the CDN, I don't see a beta for classic
---
Fuck you
---
https://mmo-gs.com/wow-classic-release-date-what-to-expect/
---
Now, only one question remains: How will the access be doled out? Subscription/random keys/open and free?
---
That's why they're sharding starting zones...
---
Awesome dude. Thanks :D Hype then!
---
I get where you're coming from but think of all the things the community figured out from the brief alpha that the developers had no idea about and have since fixed.  A beta will lead to the highest quality classic possible.  I can accept losing some hype for that.
---
HYPE
---
These idiot personalities like Tipsout and Kargoz calling it "CONFIRMED!!!!!!" on their streams yet they have no evidence or sources except that some other dumbass extrapolating unconfirmable shit. I fucking hate these Youtubers more and more by the minute.
---
I know Ronda Rousey (former MMA fighter, now in the WWE) plays retail in between her training camps, he plays a nelf druid. So she might play classic too who knows
---
Fact!
---
Multishot and volley. Both relatively low damage
---
Why did the GMs have all those overpowered and ridiculous items if they weren't allowed to do anything with them and get fired if they accidentally use them
---
Yaasssssss!!! Excitement building massively!!
---
What are your thoughts on a universal U.S. EHR system?
---
Go fuck yourself moron
---
Before anyone goes wild, how about we first check sources? On bnet marlin site I can see that the classic wow was last updated at 	2018-11-05 15:19:42. So I am doubting this post.
---
It's not really. It turns out not attacking for periods of time isn't a great thing to spend your time doing when you're brought to a raid to kill things.
---
I’ve heard this idea before and I like it
---
Easy to get.

Anyone have any actual evidence of this? I don't see it on the CDN.

Is there evidence of this? How do you just browse their CDN?
---
Most likely randomly assigned to accounts that have opted into wow beta’s
---
It might affect who is best at farming based on what content is available. And if they nerf things like solo DM Trib runs.
---
&gt; then HUNTER might actually be the "best" class since they're the undisputed kings of WPVP 
---
What? rofl, no where near it.
---
CDN is just a technology for distributing files (games, patches). If WoW Classic is on CDN that means it's (almost) ready for players to download (but not available yet)
---
Their shit still floods my recommended feed even if I tag their content and I'm sure it does to others as well. All this succeeds in doing is lowering their credibility.
---
Fake News! It's not up on the CDN

Kargoz is skeptical. Don't lose your shit so quickly over this its bad for your heart.

Paladins can pull a lot more than 3-4. When doing stuff like farming demonic runes in felwoods you can easily pull 7+ and still only be limited by the number of mobs you're actually able to pull.

---
Computer hardware, internet speeds, cloud hosting... A lot has improved since WoW's original release. If the servers can't handle day 1 it's because Blizzard cheaped out to maximize profits.
---
What was the communication like between GMs? Did you frequently get second opinions before handing out a ban, for example?

Look again, it's on there now.

I learned by virtue of wiping because we were under-geared and barely at level. It was either try something new or keep dying, and I was initially going to draw her away from the melee as they ran the other direction. Then she stood there and we all went: “liiiightbuuuulb” because we had hacked the fight and it was suddenly easymode.

There is a "WoW Classic Beta" under "Current WoW versions per branch" though, but no actual build.

My moment was very similar to yours, but with Duskwood. The Stalvan &amp; Abercrombie quest chains already made the zone feel drastically different from Elwynn, Westfall, &amp; Redridge, and then I wandered into Deadwind. Made the zombies and worgen I'd been fighting off for a few levels look positively cheery compared to the barren moonscape ravines and skull level vultures. Every now and then I'd head back and be shocked every time that the entire zone was still *horribly* deadly. Really gave the sense of a world where my character's problems were on a completely different level from the curses looming over some places.  
---
Also a significant factor in why I loved TBC so much, since I finally got to really understand and explore the cause of Deadwind's gloom.
---
That looks like the old beta.

thanks bud

One of my most memorable days in WoW history ever.

Ah yes, the toxicity of letting some sub-optimal specs into a 40 man raid. 
---
You're also right in that i'm very toxic with all the profanity in describe other players playing the game a way they enjoy. \^ohwaitThatsyou 
---
I'm also very, very toxic in my willingness to ensure you're one less person i dont have to argue/fight with in a videogame by suggesting to avoid you in the future release.
---
sooooooooooooo toxic

MRGM is fairly reliable.
---
My brother was right into wow playing vanilla wow. I came home one night and he was doing UBRS, and it looked brilliant. I had a wee shot playing a dwarf hunter and walking into Ironforge made me want to get my own account and play too.
---
Was heavily addicted, playing 4-6hrs a day and raiding 3 times a week, till Cat was released. Then I had kids and got married, so it seemed a good time to go cold turkey.
---
Still rank the 1st Rags kill as the best feeling ever. Or the time I finally tamed Humar the pride lord! 
---
My fav instance was the deadlines, felt like I was one of the goonies! 😂
---
Yes we do? There's a ton of videos about people doing the exact farms listed above from 2006.
---
Any class can work for this, pick your poison kinda.  Ranked in order of personal preference for what you described:  
---
Druid - easiest class in the game to gear in raids, role is simple and well defined in pve.  PvP has multiple handfuls of viable specs and works through wars of attrition and is really nasty in the hands of a good player/tryhard, best WSG flag runners in the game and super hard to outlast or burst out in 1v1 open world.  
---
Priest - pve healing as a priest is theoretically higher skillcap or 'hard,' and gearing is more challenging, and your pve gear won't help you in wpvp as much like druid gear does.  However, once you have the right gear you can respec shadow outside of raids and you're a busted 1v1er, typically only 'beaten' by people who outrange and run away.    
---
Shaman - pve healing pretty stressful unless you're in a guild with 6+ shamans because you have a windfury group and melee will bother you about it most likely.  Not very strong early game, come AQ and beyond though elemental outside of raids becomes really scary, similar to shadow priest in that it's strong in wpvp, more like a zappy mage in playstyle.   
---
Pally - same as priest in that the pve gear wont help your pvping, ret is kind of a meme in pvp as well.  Unless you're attracted to the pally class fantasy I personally think this is the priest situation but worse unless you have a big tryhard warrior friend you pvp with all the time, then it would be on par with priest imo.
---
Before BWL was out, T2 dropped in MC. It was weird, you’d be able to get either set. It didn’t last long and not too many people were successfully raiding at that time (on my server anyway)
---
My day is perfectly fine, but if I want to vent about these blithering idiots, then I can very well do so without being angry or having my day ruined.
---
He was stealthed about to gank the shit out of the Tauren.
---
Fuck me in the asshole, finally.
---
Guess I’m going to intentionally not learn poisons at level 20 as a rogue to relive the blissful ignorance
---
And my axe
---
I sure as shit hope not, I never once have been invited to any Blizzard beta over 10+ years of having opted in.
---
It's not. It's 1.13, the blizzcon one was labelled as a demo and not a beta.
---
You took the words right out of my mouth
---
I guess that means the giant trash heap in the pacific becomes the maelstrom then?
---
jesus christ LOL
---
I enjoyed the hell out of it.  I am not even exaggerating when I say the first 6 months I was as excited to go to work as I was to log into the game itself.  I have pretty much nothing but great memories from that time.
---
Did you ever get into the same room as or around Jeff kaplan? i know his department was totally different, but ,maybe he just walked by one day or something? lol
---
Played alongside the kicker for the Arizona Cardinals during TBC. Guy was chill, always had fun running around ganking with him. [Photo evidence was provided]
---
Very epicly win sir!
---
The simplest and most logical solution would have been to make quest givers immune to being killed on PVE servers.  On PVP servers there was a PVP solution to griefers.
---
Impressive how the numbers were actually kinda even.
---
It’s on the site.
---
MtG! :)
---
There is a "WoW Classic Beta" under "Current WoW versions per branch", but there's no actual build in the DB though.
---
https://twitter.com/Marlamin/status/1118609226694369280 Or not...
---
Haha, I still have a t-shirt my ex gave me, “rogues the original gankstas”
---
Whatever man, it’s easy to not click recommended videos. They’re probably making less than minimum wage from the work they put in so just let them do their thing lol.
---
How did you get into those areas?
---
This hints you may be on to something
---
No problem, enjoyed their segment. I can attest that honestly their loot system is the best thing ever. Last I heard they had no intention to come back for classic (but that was a few years ago). Now they they are coming back I'm almost tempted to go horde just to play with them again.. Desperately hoping to find an alliance guild which will adopt their systems haha. Don't know that I want to put the exceeding effort they do to run it myself at the moment, guess we will see where I am at come launch!
---
People talked about this all the time when the game first came out. It also got brought up a lot during the MOP release because people were saying China was going to find the pandas disrespectful. I guess I got to remember not everyone’s played for 15 years or are old enough to remember things like that.
---
Personally for me it started in WOD. You mean you want me to log on every day do chores in the exact same spot not even traveling to get there for two hours due to doing it on a main+alt? And I am going to be able to play the actual game on my limited schedule when again? Then in legion they changed from dailies which I liked because if you were a competent player you could usually bang them out in sub 45 minutes to world quests that are 80% travel time thus I can't do them any faster no matter how competent I am.  I quit without even trying BFA but everything I have read sounds like they made it even worse and more grindy.
---
I don‘t understand this wtf is a CDN??? How does it confirm a beta please explain.
---
There's no file uploaded for it yet but they've added a field for it in the "current versions per branch" summary at the top. 
---
At this stage it's just an early indicator: we're probably getting a beta, and they're making space for it on the CDN summary.
---
Back in 2005ish when my account was banned 100 gold was still worth 30 dollars or something like that.  Easily enough for my 15 or 16 year old self to go to the movies =D
---
&gt;WoW Classic	1.13.0.28377
---
This is more exciting than I even imagined
---
The WoW.exe here: https://bnet.marlam.in/extract.php?type=install&amp;product=wow&amp;build=db00c310c6ba0215be3f386264402d56
---
Has the hash 5a860a304179c093ff111c7388e4c7bc
---
When I check the MD5 hash of my backup of the beta from the fall I get 56E74E3A6A0EB359E2538FCBC2E7CD5D
---
Can someone confirm the hash I got and the my old demo exe isn't corrupted?
---
I'm really feeling all this non-toxicity from you.  Good job!
---
My main realm in Vanilla was RP-PvP, and I'll be very disappointed if it's not an option for Classic.
---
&gt;I made over 100g/h from my herb gathering
---
Not the same at all. You collected something that you could trade to other players for gold they farmed somewhere.
---
Tribute runs is literally injecting 100g/hour per hunter into the economy from vendoring drops. It's completely gamebreaking.
---
You should level however you feel like. No build is going to prevent you from hitting 60. Also depending when you hit mid to upper 50s the pre raid gear farming/leveling route might be a bit hard. If you get there too fast there might not be enough people around to make it worth it since youll be leveling so slow. And if you do it later theres also the fact that you will be competing with other lvl 60 healers. I personally would rather take a 60 over a 56. So definitely play that by ear.
---
Hand of edward is cool on ele shaman. You can make it work. But imo you will be do very little to no actual physical damage even with wf procs. There isn't really any good spell damage and physical damage gear till aq. You would actually be better off just going full spell damage gear and using flametongue since itll scale off all that spell damage. That being said again ironfoe would be the biggest waste of time I could imagine. Even if you stack full attack power gear, at that point you might as well just go full enh spec with a 2h. 
---
If I were you I would just go with the regular 30/0/21 ele/resto spec. And use hand of edward/a fast caster dagger (the MC dagger or claw of chrommag from bwl) with flametongue weapon. You'll probably be more successful
---
No to be a debbie downer but the WOW-28377patch1.13.0_Retail version was uploaded on 11/5/2019 (Nov 5). Which was during Blizzcon.
---
&gt;WoW Classic Beta
---
right there, last entry
---
You can see "WoW Classic Beta" listed in the "Current WoW versions per branch" section at the top of the page, it doesn't have a version yet because nothing has been uploaded for it. Seems to confirm that that are planning a beta phase but nothing to indicate it will be arriving anytime soon.
---
So the main GM client was an in house developed chat client with access to all the information a GM would need to function.  Account info, chat logs, access to the ticket queue etc.
---
The actual character UI was strikingly similar to the normal game UI with maybe like 1 extra overlay and the ability to input GM commands.  Each GM had 3 characters a Horde, an Alliance and the character you chatted with.  You could customize the Horde and Alliance characters if you wanted to but in general unless you were a Lead GM, you were very unlikely to show yourself to a player.
---
Oy.  Okay, so, someone linked the [bnet.marlam.in](https://bnet.marlam.in) site, which I'm not familiar with, and people are saying 'Ahmigerd there's nothing there!', so, screenshot:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/GegUDWf.png](https://i.imgur.com/GegUDWf.png)
---
At the bottom, 'WoW Classic Beta'.
---
I do not know how this site sources its information, so this is all I can say: if this site is rock-solid, there it is.  If it's not, then it's not.
---
I'd rather call them out on their bullshit. I earn nothing from the work I put in in calling them out, so just let me do my thing.
---
Check again. It's there.
---
https://bnet.marlam.in/monitor.php
---
You may be on to something. Will update post.
---
That one is part of the demo. The Beta stuff is literally going up as we speak so all we have so far is the listing of it. Expect new files to appear over the next few hours.
---
This makes perfect sense, this is more or less exactly the private server meta atm.  Some people go as far as leveling the mage (or hunter) first so they can start gold generation earlier, but if dire maul isn't in the game when you finish leveling early server you wont gain much for doing the farming class first.
---

---
THE HYPE IS REAL
---
How is end game raiding favored for Alliance? Both factions have access to those raids.
---
5-6 months is way too early imo. That's barely into BWL, while the original timeline had it at \~21 months for NA, 18 months for EU, it's way too early. I'd vote phase 6, when the servers go into maintenance mode, or at least 5.   
---
I really feel that these choices shouldn't be made based on the scenario that the game will see a mass exodus or not. Preparations could/should be made, planning ahead is a good thing, being on the forefront of looking at things such as server merging etc. but definitely not xrealm pvp, it's akin to speeding up the release schedule to try to make people stick around.
---
Fake source
---
&gt;The idea that a class specific farming method will over-inflate  the market is far-fetched.
---
I disagree and so does economics. Back in Vanilla these methods of farming were not well known. But just imagine 100 hunters per server injecting 100g/hour into the economy every day. What do you think starts happening to the prices of everything when this much gold enter circulation all of a sudden?
---
Is this a 4chan troll OP? I'm seeing most people say it's not there with just a couple claiming it's legit.
---
It crushed me
---
i picked based on reading the description of each class. good times.
---
I should really do some testing on this. However it’s procs enough for me to love it. The key is to not depend on it and not to design your play style around it or you’ll start making mistakes. However there’s many times you find yourself in melee range for a variety of reasons. One of my favorite tricks to do is when a hunter is trying to kite me hard I’ll auto attack the pet to fetch procs. You’ll find creative ways to make use of it and it’ll sometimes allow you to pull off some quick nice moves which honestly helps a lot in battlegrounds when u rly needa make something happen like quick cap a node in ab by quickly wiping the def
---
That is exactly how I discovered it.. Oh look, a skull dragon running at me from 2 miles away... shit..
---
I wouldnt play retail, specially this xpac. Feels like a chore simulator to me.
---
I think I was playing around in the Barrens in my late teens. At that point, as an orc, there's not really any big "Wow..." moments beyond going into Orgrimmar for the first time and seeing all the high levels with their ridiculous gear. That changed when I got tired of brown and ran to either Ashenvale or Darkshore and stumbled across a giant, broken statue. Very epic looking area.
---
A CDN is a content delivery network, widely used to allow people to access content as fast as possible given their region, i.e. you accessing reddit would be via the most closely related cdn network.
---
It means that they are pushing out a downloadable build to various regions so people can download it.
---
...so you DON'T want vanilla fans being able to test the game and check for bugs/glitches and other small details that can be fixed?
---
Why?

It's... it's beautiful.

I was here.

You son of a bi.... jk lol.
---
Yeah well I definitely did the selling. I was super disappointed. Was the only person on my server at the time with the Deathcharger reins, and none the less I was a human holy paladin so it was even more badass =D.
---
Always amazed me how severe that punishment was for a first time offender and how little of an effect my 100 gold had. Figured theyd be going after the king pins.  
---
I remember my friend was caught for using illegal botting programs a couple years back and got a 90 day suspension. He definitely influenced the economy and game more with botting than I did selling my 100 gold and getting a perma ban that GM's wont even overturn today lol.
---
You're getting downvoted because you want to go undead rogue and you dont want to grief. That's like an oxy moron
---
Usually means some buff, effect or talent is boosting the stat above its normal value. Red text means the opposite.
---
F.ex if you spec into the wand damage talent as a priest, the number should turn green. If you have a debuff reducing damage by X amount, the text should go red.
---
If you go to the website and look at the history tab on the top it mentions April 16th, 2019
---
No, in fact being logged into your personal account while on the clock was not only highly discouraged, but if something went wrong could be grounds for being fired.
---
The integrity of the game is extremely important to Blizzard, the GM's are there to serve the player base first and foremost.
---
I don't like this.
---
It's looking less like a troll and more like an overreaction. They're preparing to upload a beta to the CDN it would seem, but that tells us nothing.
---
This would make sense as that takes us into May. A beta in May would make a ton of sense for a summer release.
---
Gold was expensive in vanilla. I remember it being as high as like $50 for 100g at one point. It came down by the end but at points its was stupid expensive.
---
It is on the CDN.
---
Check the history/monitor tab:  [https://bnet.marlam.in/monitor.php](https://bnet.marlam.in/monitor.php)

Classic was updated yesterday on the CDN.

Not today!  https://twitter.com/Marlamin/status/1118609226694369280

Look at the history tab
---
What do you think of modern GMs having no real in game presence? It seems they had a lot more fun back in the earlier days.
---
Another source: https://twitter.com/Marlamin/status/1118609226694369280

I wish they would completely change the layout of all the cities, quests and everything.
---
I know, dumb idea, but it would be almost like a whole new game. lol. sorry im high.
---
1 week open stress test beta to anyone who downloads the client just like the original vanilla wow release
---
Who is MrGM?
---
&gt; Instant cast
---
heh im sorry
---
Content delivery network. Its where files go to be available for massive distribution.
---
Wow, you really want to prove your point, don't you? The thing is, even if I grant you all of these things my point does not change. Whether vanilla bosses were, per your strict definition (and I have some problems with it), tank and spank or required a miniscule amount of strategy has no bearing on the fact that PvE vanilla encounters are primitive by the modern mythic raiding standards.
---
I mean it is probably just some dude building the structure for it to be uploaded soon. I legit think this means beta is a couple weeks away, money is on the first week of May.
---
let me iiiiinnnn.
---
Hyjal was intended to be an area not a raid at first
---
They recycled it
---
Just found out that you can find 56E74E3A6A0EB359E2538FCBC2E7CD5D in the older classic version on the CDN.
---
So no new hashes for WoW.exe so far.
---
*weeks

WBERYONE

CALM DOWWWANNNNNNN
---
Edit: AHHHH
---
15 years of expansion have showed us that, no matter how many months beta lasted, how many bugs were signaled, no, they will not handle it.
---
Did you ever do any undercover investigations (I’ve heard GMs could be invisible) to ban players for farming?
---
Beta for classic wasn’t announced.  But we can see it’s on the cdn, announcement should be soon
---
And to erase all doubt: https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291275
---
The only way race \*wouldn't\* matter in a tryhard guild is if you were outperforming players on bis races, which means their raid spots should be under duress or you're very very good...both are possible.  On horde, assuming equal skill and effort, the issue for you will be weapons.  Orc tanks/furies take axe prio, non-orc \*tanks\* and rogues get swords prio, rogues get dagger prio plus maybe one tank who wants to use a dagger build....and the off-race fury warriors are shit end of the stick.  You'll have a raid spot but it would be silly to expect something like first Crul or CTS because it just isn't the best decision for the performance of the raid as a unit.  Pro-tip: Advertise yourself as 'third offtank' and wear a somewhat mixed gear set up on MC patch.  You'll spend most of the raid doing fury dps, tank on a couple bosses like sulfuron and majordomo, but subtly elevate yourself to non-orc tank prio on weapons lol.
---
Thanks very much for the explanation!
---
I have never seen statistics of ERP on pve vs pvp realms (but yes, Moonguard was probably the biggest) but will argue that there's likely a demand for a place to ERP, and if there's no normal RP servers you will see it on RP-PVP servers. 
---
I will try to explain my point about raid times one more time. Has Blizz said how many normal realms they will open? Will it be concentrated on NA/European/Oceanic etc. only? If so, what about finding a normal realm PST server?This kind of time zone issue is where I would prefer a "demand for niche servers" to be so that those of us in the west can find raiding times that don't interfere with our jobs. If I had to pick and choose, I'd prefer that realms took into consideration reasonable raiding for all players in all time zones rather than an RP realm, that's all. This isn't a bark against Rp-PvP. We just don't know what kind of sustainable numbers Classic will have at this point. In the very least, players can deem any PvP server their RP playground. 
---
People playing on private servers will 90% quit and play Classic; please don't pretend to think they won't or aren't interested in it. In fact, thanks to the petition from Nostalrius that got thousands of signatures--mostly from folks on private servers--this is what moved the idea forward for Classic servers. The Blizz team actually met with Nost and listened to the petition. 
---
Finally, I have no animosity--just trying to be realistic about numbers and how many realms there will actually be. I hope that Classic has time zone realms before considering RP realms.
---
Theres also the history tab at the top
---
Im with the guy you responded to.  There isnt a current version listed for the Beta, and the last file marked classic is from November.
---
Its nice that a beta is listed, though.  Hopefully we will see one soon, and maybe it'll update as the day goes on...but as far as i can see the last updates to Classic files were Nov.
---
It's not an overreaction, if it's on che CDN it's coming, simple as that.
---
ah well, I recall spammers selling like 200 gold for 10$, or something.
---
How do we sign up for the Beta?
---
Game is really good! There are a lot of hidden features you can unlock after level 16. Sure it’s mainly a survival game but once you take care of that your given the opportunity to explore the world around you. Also the avatar you’ve been given has a world within it self. Few put in the time for this expansion, but I hear it’s were the solo end game is.
---
Hunters are top tier in wpvp though? They can kite all melees and the pet is strong versus casters, even if it isn't 1.0 attackspeed broken tooth
---
Theres so many people playing pvp servers.... I always went pve but now I feel like I should reconsider
---
I leveled my ND rogue combat.  It sucked, but probably not worse than any other spec.  Single pulls with cooldowns down and fall in love with first aid.
---
Well you cant blindly rush with any comp into mythic raids tho, a good comp is NEEDED to progress, some bosses are even near impossible without multiple chars with the same spec (spriest for furnace in wod, dh/ww/warr for ghuun, baöance stacking for blackhand (although im not sure about this one))
---
This. Hunters &gt; All in WPVP.
---
This is so Vanilla it hurts
---
No release date but signs of a beta coming soon!
---
Agreed. They will need our help to test some things out and to give it a good look over for anything they might have missed.
---
Then look at wowhead news :D
---
I see. I was following the thread on wow forums and every comment said it was a troll and that there hasn't been any upload to CDN..
---
You actually can. By climbing the mountains where you talk to the high elf for the final part of the onyxia attunement, there are some huge roots from the world tree. If you look up you can see the stem and crowd of the tree.
---
I'm saying it tells us almost nothing we didn't already know.
---
Hi, /u/BLeeK1337
---
:O
---
Do your thing? Calling people idiots and morons because they didn’t react to something how you wanted them to? 
---
It sure is easy to be mean on the internet huh?
---
I don’t like their content either but I don’t try to put them down because of it lol
---
Beastmaster hunters were so easy to play in wow. A tiger/lion with bestial wrath could solo most classes while the hunter could kite most classes. 
---
Hunters were great for levelling and farming once lvl 60.  I played one raiding till about 2012.
---
But my fav character was a resto shammy doing AV’s and pvp, just had more fun healing than dpsing.
---
But...he doesn't make youtube videos, he gets clipped by like 8 different youtube accounts that basically just re-upload and edit his twitch VoDs.
---
There will be a non-zero number of people who both care about their PvP rank and want to gank quest givers and I agree that DHKs discourage those people from doing it. But people who aren't ranking yet or who have got all the rank they want can gank totally freely, there's no meaningful penalty at all for those people.
---
It also seems like it strongly discourages things like raids to kill city leaders, which most people seem to agree are fun and good content.
---
I am not saying there is zero upside to DHKs, but they seem like a poorly targeted solution that discourages behaviour people do not want to discourage, and fails to penalise some griefers at all.
---
^
---
Thanks for the replies!
---
If your focus is pvp, you can get away without going tailoring.  You can wear bloodvine without being a tailor and just not get the set bonus while still getting the hit, only losing 2% crit for it which is pretty small for a warlock in pve especially if you're allowed to use a corruption slot on bosses.
---
those are the worst kind of people, if im the group leader thats a instakick, no matter if we're at the last boss or whatever
---
Using a ranged weapon? As a hunter? What a waste of ammo. Catch me with my twin "of the Tiger" green swords.
---
I played cata on launch day with no problems. Wrath launch was a bit rough but playable.
---
Have they ever said if it will be an open PTR or are they going down the expansion test route?
---
Hell yeah! It's happening!!!
---
A 3 month beta would put us at exactly July 16th, interesting coincidence....
---
100g back then was upwards of $20.
---
I know from..eherhm...experience.
---
Now it showes : WoW Classic	1.13.0.28377
---
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
---
Thats Karen Gillan
---
thanks MrGM
---
&gt; Molten Core has 10 bosses. Of the ten, only Magmadar, Garr and Golemagg can be considered tank and spank.
---
Literally every boss except Majordomo is a tank and spank.  They all have 1 mechanic which is either ads or "dont stand in the fire".
---
I actually bought some Activision stock specifically in anticipation for classic release.  It's really a no brainers right now.
---
Yes exactly. Forgot to mention this part.
---
Quite complicated compared to modern wow.
---
&gt; By climbing the mountains where you talk to the high elf for the final part of the onyxia attunement, there are some huge roots from the world tree. If you look up you can see the stem and crown of the tree
---
oh well, maybe I couldn't.
---
Blame my PC for not handling higher view distances. I recall that when setting it higher, it would only draw barely-visible figures in the fog, so I preferred a few extra frames instead.

In two weeks hell yeah

I agree and I’m not actually gunna be that guy don’t worry 😅

Now that you mention it, it makes sense. I better learn how to be an edgelord.
---
Such horde bias... 3 horde and one alliance is what I read. :)
---
I admit that when I was young I thought rp realms were for ultra dorks. I still dont play rp, but I've kind of matured my attitude to a more live and let live attitude. People have different play styles and goals in an mmo than i do and I see no reason to hate on people for that. I really hope blizzard releases a few different rppvp realms in different time zones. We're getting a legitimate vanilla experience owned and operated by blizzard! It's still surreal. I hope everyone who wants to play it has the opportunity to do so in the manner of their choosing.
---
This looks more promising than the marlamin one.
---
That just means Blizzard didn't make Overwatch
---
Fuck. Me and all my friends gonna roll horde, but forgot about this!!! Well guess we’ll have to change

It depends on the level but I'd personally say hunters, mages, and rogues are the kinda agreed upon wpvp stars

AAAAHHHHHHH IT'S HAPPENING
---
Don't know if you can answer this but how was the pay?
---
That's been there. The "Beta" part is the new one!
---
It's happening!
---
A three month beta would put us at exactly July 16th, interesting coincidence....
---
I guess you could they...*were not prepared* :V
---
Had this happen to me several times just from lag and a potato computer. I'd always end up falling through the Hinterlands.
---
Time to get fucking hype!
---
Classic wowhead also put up the files
---
This is also a joke.
---
ho forgot that
---
Not really, WoD, Legion and BFA all handled 5 million+ day one people logging in and playing without major hiccups. A bit laggier and a couple buggy quests but entirely playable.  
---
There was and is a ton of problems with those games, but at a technical level millions of players isn't at all an issue for them anymore the way it was in the TBC/Wrath days.
---
It was a tongue-in-cheek response to you. The money they make from Youtube has no bearing on my opinion of them, but their shit content does. Hyping this beta up as confirmed when it's anything but deserves to be called out, no matter if you like them or not.
---
If you want to become the richest person on the server, you better learn how to play the AH game...

I will be one of those healers. "Wait for sunders before opening up DPS" Hunter immediately starts opening up, feigns death to avoid first death, pulls again and I let him die. "derp wtf healer why didn't you heal me!" I will reply "Wait for sunders before opening up DPS." You're welcome.

It's the reverse, they should make shamans able to wield big fuck-off clubs again in retail. Shaman with a big thumper or with a mace and shield was always my idea of a tribal warrior type.

Where does it say 2 weeks from now?

Exactly. Its very on schedule

But there isn't actually anything there? Just a line of text that says wow classic, right?

So why would that indicate anything at all?

fingers crossed !

No problem, enjoyed their segment. I can attest that honestly their loot system is the best thing ever. Last I heard they had no intention to come back for classic (but that was a few years ago). Now that they are coming back I'm almost tempted to go horde just to play with them again.. Desperately hoping to find an alliance guild which will adopt their systems haha. Don't know that I want to put the exceeding effort they do to run it myself at the moment, guess we will see where I am at come launch!  
---
edit: I highly recommend anyone interested in high end min/maxing in vanilla listen to their segment and check out the loot system in more depth on the site http://onslaught-wow.com/about/ - you also can go on the k site to view the logs for the fastest kill times for each boss to see what they were talking about
---
Finally! I was starting to genuinely believe that we wouldn't get a beta and I was worried that when the game launched it would be a horribly buggy mess.
---
Glad to see my fears were unfounded.
---
Now I'm looking forward to the inevitable:

---
This, pretty much
---
Except they aren't. I see something different every day on this, lol. Last time it was "Druids beat everyone 1v1 in WPVP". Warlocks, Mages, and SPriest all destroy Hunters in WPVP. Shamans for the most part do as well, unless the Hunter gets the jump on them at max range. Warriors \*can\* get kited, but it's hard to do. Charge+Hamstring. Same for Rogues. If he's getting kited well, vanish, restart the fight.
---
It tells us that there's going to be a beta, which we didn't know.
---
There is no way they are doing an open beta...
---
Might just play ret/holy
---
As a shadow priest in pvp? Very.

You're about half an hour late, there.

Why do PvP server loudmouths base their self worth around 1 option in a videogame?

This is what WoW needs.  I hate seeing how raids get teleported for "griefing" simply because of this BS sharding system
---
Means a build has been pushed to the CDN which is a collection of files tagged by a meaningful name. In this case WoW classic. Would suggest they are prepping a beta release by the name alone :)
---
Oh yeah, loss of employment.  GMs were not meant to interfere with the game in any fashion.  If there was a visible GM spawning something that was either someone going rogue and about to lose their job or a planned event they had a designated Lead GM for.  Helping the player accomplish anything in game wasn't something we could do either.
---
The two main difficult tickets to answer were people who submitted a ticket and were cynical we could help them in the ticket description, and there were certain item restoration that were very difficult.  The cynical folks sometimes wanted stuff we couldn't give them, so they would be mad at us no matter what.  The item restoration on the other hand had some real wild rides though.
---
Every once in awhile I would get one that was like, 'yeah I was gone for a week and my ex-significant other deleted all my characters stuff and Im not sure when.'  Ok so I we search every where within that week time frame.  Find out the story checks out, here is that character giving their login info to a bunch of people in guild and saying 'yeah, do whatever you want to their account'  Then there is like 2 days of a log everyone using the /sit command on their location and now they delete 1 item every hour from the account for the next 3 days.  (ok maybe exaggerating a little ;) 
---
Anyways you have to verify everything you restore so you have to find when all this happened.  Those are the kind of tickets you get a cup of coffee before starting.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObWrdYQ_6xY !!!!!
---
I saw elsewhere that its usually two weeks after they set up a PTR CDN that it goes live.  Not 100% on that but I feel they might have read something similar.
---
I found farming with a hunter and bear to be very easy! My main way was running the scarlet monastery and gathering the mobs up. Bear swipe was good for tanking several mobs. Using flame traps and volley &amp; multi shot meant I could farm it fast. My professions were skinning and enchanting, and disenchanting all greens and bop’s, selling the enchanting mats &amp; Boe’s &amp; cloth on the AH, and vendoring all other crap, could easily make 80-100g every 2 hrs. 
---
I’d vendor all the rubbish, post all the stuff to my AH alt next to the post box at the AH and throw the stuff up, then rinse repeat. 
---
I always had plenty of gold in vanilla, that all 4-5 alts had epic mounts before tBC.
---
Transpose your IG "ideology" to IRL and you will immediately see what's wrong with your pseudo justifications for griefing (if you don't, congrats you're a sociopath).
---
You're griefing because you like it. You enjoy being a mean little boy and getting away with it.
---
 That's it, no need to coat it with grand reasons.
---
If the game was PVE only, your kind would train people (see EQ), or just find a way to ruin people's fun (see Monkeynew's classic duel video, 2 druids bears are running on top of him for a good 10 minutes).
---
Fwiw I did and I will play on a PVP server despite your kind, but I don't need to kill grays to feel good about me.
---
Getting a spot in a top tier guild as a hunter might be rough, since most guilds will only bring 2-3 of them 
---
But it's also one of the more complex and hard to master classes in vanilla, so if you're actually good at it, you should be able to find a spot
---
HYPE TRAIN! WOO! WOO!
---
I'm assuming that's a Twitch emote? You must be pretty cool.
---
How long are your fingers? You use f1-f12
---
Well you are not completely wrong! A BETA was confirm! :D
---
Embrace it dude. If you wanted to go raiding rogue go troll or orc. Troll is technically bis for pve I think but then you don't get the 25% stun resist for pvp which is actually much better for pvp then wotf. On insta 60 pvp servers, pretty much everyone goes orc Because of the passive 25% stun resist on any class that can play orc.

My character from vanilla is still permanently a chicken because of a GM. I am a chicken warrior. I avoid doing a lot on him for fear or losing the effect due to people reporting me
---
Open? Doubtful.
---
Depends why you're raiding. If it's to min/max the most dps you can, battle other classes at the top of the meters and compete with other guilds for best parses then no, hunter is not going to be a great choice. If it's to work as a team to see and clear the content and just to play your part without being competitive hunter would be fine.
---
Yep I quit playing a pserver to beta test I was just leveling for fun Sid’s rather help bug fix the 5 mans and quest.
---
We need the story here
---
How much did they pay you?
---
My pulse is legit racing.
---
Are you sure about WoD's release? Also in BfA large realms literally couldn't play for like 12 hours after launch.
---
Did you ever personally catch and punish someone sneaking onto the GM Island?
---
Also, and feel free to not answer this one but here goes: Would you say most GM's who caught someone on the GM Island were personally insulted and/or outraged by the act? A lot of the punishments I've read about people sneaking onto the island seem overly harsh, 1-2 week suspensions, stuff like that. It seems to me a lot of GM's took it way too personally, like the Island was their precious little retreat and how **dare** these unwashed plebs set foot on its sacred sands? Was there any truth to this? Or am I just being silly? :P
---
A hunter that dies to a warrior (assuming same lvl, full life etc) should really really reconsider his or her career choice !
---
Does the beta discovery count? If so I'll consider you half right
---
That’s just customer service
---
Beta was just published. You might be getting a golden shower by the end of the day....
---
[ITS HAPPENING!](https://i.imgur.com/7drHiqr.gif)
---
correct there *isn't* nothing new, classic beta was pushed on april 16th 2019
---
 A content delivery network (CDN) is what they use to push patches/games out to users(edited)  
---
or in this case, beta.  
---
You cant just have one server that every users client has to access to download patches/install files, there is no way one device can handle of that data/requests.  So you create a CDN and copy the files onto many servers all over the world and each players client accesses the closest one to download from.... Think of it as load-balancing and redundancy.(edited)  
---
Netflix uses the same sorta thing.
---
Sppppllllooooosssshhhhhhh.  Too soon again?
---
I miss Thottbot so much.  So much better to use on my dial up connection.
---
How do you kill that wich has no life ?
---
I don't really see the big deal. I've played on retail with Reckful, Soda, Snutz, Pookz, and a bunch of others. I've never really seen or had that much of a negative impact by being with them. Maybe it was b/c I was with them, but there wasn't like 20+ people following them around. It just helped populate the server b/c people wanted the highest level of competition in PvP. Classic is much different though. Hard to follow people into cross-server groups/raids/pvp instances ect. Classic it's way easier to find and target someone in the world. 
---
I still don't see an issue at all. If anything i'm going to most likely pick a server more closely related to my god damn time zone or a very active/high pop server. The game after a some months will likely die out, so you still want a decent amount of people and not a low pop server with like 1 good guild, and 5 mediocre ones.
---
I don’t get it - is there a joke I’m missing somewhere?
---
CLASSIC WOW, ON AN OPEN HARDDRIVE NED!
---
&gt; What does Content Delivery Network entail? Is it a schedule/rollout of some sort or?
---
ELI5: Blizzard has cleared out space in the front of Walmart for Beta, put up a pedestal and shelves there for Beta, labeled that section Beta... but has not put anything there yet.
---
We'll get it when they stock the shelves and say we can have it.
---
I said that in general PvP is preferred over PvE that also goes for Rp server , simple as that.
---
Well, if you think outside the Reddit/Discord bubble Rp is not a big thing in general. Most Rpers are part of the core community which would be very active on subreddits and discord servers. With those people RpPvP is more popular than RpPvE. If you say there is not enough interest in RpPvP servers to warrant such a realm, then you'd have to say the same about RpPvE servers.
---
If you look on the EU classic discord there is such a poll. RpPvP is slightly ahead of PvE. To be fair, the amouont of participants is not very high, but it shows that within the core community the interest in RpPvP is there.
---
Rp is the least popular server type with the Classic crwod.
---
I never thought millions of people are going to join us. I said, that among the millions of people who will try Classic, there will easily be enough players to fill up one RpPvP server on EU and one on NA. If you think there is not enough interest for two of those servers globally then you are the delusional one. 
---
Because retail is not Classic? At this point, they are two different games. There is no real difference between PvP and PvE and there hasn't been one for years.
---
The fact stand, RpPvP is more popular with the core Classic audience than RpPvE. Saying RpPvP is more niche just showed how out of touch Ion Hazzikostas was with the Classic playerbase. He bases his assumption on a totally different game.
---
The poll with 7.8% people voting for RpPvP had over 10k participants.
---
I remember crashing when getting into the garrison and everyone was in “space “ for like a day
---
So yeah wod launch while better was still not ideal
---
His own YouTube videos are actually really good. People just clip his streams for easy money. 
---
When you see him on his stream it's basically another persona.
---
Hunters are dime a dozen. In vanilla they were awesome to play. Easy to solo stuff as a good tanking pet could take all your Aggro.  
---
I’d have classed myself as a good to above average player and a good hunter. For raiding though, I was always behind the mage/rogue/lock on DPS meters, no matter how much I worked on my shot rotations and such. 
---
I found that Most 40 man raids has no more than 3 hunters.  
---
However hunters are great for UBRS for kiting drakk, they could pull to the tank with low level arcane shot. 
---
So I’d say a good hunter is very valuable.
---
Whats the coincidence? Sorry for not knowing.
---
Well, since my vacation time is for launch, I’ll have to use my sick time for beta! Muahahaha *cough* *cough*
---
My hype for classic has reached a new level, once again!
---
Did you prefer the old GM style of having to talk to people in game and occasionally see each other face to face in game, or the current way blizzard handles the ticket system where you don't ever speak to the GM themselves and they handle your problem a bit more "behind the scenes"? Also, can we get a gm joke :)
---
So stupid question, will we be able to keep our beta characters?

Undead male has the best animations for everything. I'll fight whoever says otherwise!

I don’t RP, but I prefer RP-PVP realms because of the people on them. Toward the end of retail Vanilla, that’s where my toons were. I’d like two RP-PVP servers- one for my Horde toons and one one for Alliance.
---
GLADLY ( ͡☉ ͜ʖ ͡☉)
---
You use to be able to get up there, even after they took out wall jumping, if you were persistent enough!  Very cool zone with fun Easter eggs.
---
SOMEONE PIN THIS PLZ
---
Which is why i specifically said in my post that there isnt a **version** listed.  I didnt say that beta itself wasnt there.
---
There just isnt a file associated with it yet.  This could be future overhead stuff that theyre adding, even if they wont be putting anything up for a while.
---
The simple fact is we dont know.  Heres to hoping we get something soon, but by no means is this a guarantee that we will.
---
Me too and theres no way it's going down in 4 hours
---
FETCH ME THE HYPE STRETCHER, NOW!
---
Definitely really sad that they decided against RP-PvP realms, I voted for that option and would like to play on one, if they add them post launch however, I probably won't switch since by then I'll likely be familiar with the server I play on at the time's community already and losing that is a big deal
---
Don't forget the shield spike!

There were a few hints in the classic wow presentation that could be interpreted as a July 16th release date. There's been a lot of debate about whether it's a legit easter egg or just a tinfoil hat conspiracy.

YOU DID IT KINDA!

WE GET CLASSIC BETA SOONISH!

Hell no

You can only join once, but bringing another player into the guild grants you the title Bane of Beans!

Hell a DPS warrior almost uses spell power consumes better with shadow oils on the weapons. 2x Ebon Hand + shadow oil = true prebis
---
Im already on the bus omw to camp outside of Walmart then.
---
By the way does anyone know if human females have comically oversized weapons in vanilla?  I know they did around the time of wrath.
---
What's the difference then?
---
Only played TBC with battlegroups and Private servers that are single server PvP.
---
Fair enough, have a good day!
---
Classic is a recreation of the base game
---
Current WoW is like a bastardized version of Battlechess
---
PVE/PVP or overall?
---
What are the chances you’ll kiss me
---
How much and how did they monitor your work?
---
And a 2 month beta would put us at June 25th.     
---
I can do that too.  
---
To be a bit less snarky: this assumes they’ll announce it and open up the beta today... which they didn’t do with the 8.2 PTR so it wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that they will give at least a few days notice before beta begins. It also assumes that they feel a three month beta period is necessary when they can probably do decent enough testing with one or two months given that it should be mostly double checking to see if everything was imported properly as well as stress testing.  
---
Especially since if they start next tuesday (or thursday) and do two months of testing then they can get it out on June 25th, a week before a major release for a competing mmo.
---
Yeah I only ever did customer service for World of Warcraft and was like that the entire time I worked there.
---
I actually believe that it is probably ok to have the current system they have.  Not every GM necessarily plays WoW or had even played WoW before getting the job.  Over time you learn what the job entails more so than you need actual knowledge of World of Warcraft.  Knowledge of the games is a plus though, I was known as being a very hardcore player off the clock and it had it's advantages, but I wasn't necessarily able to serve players better than anyone else because of it.
---
The thing is the customer support works as a team at the end of the day.  We all have to ask each other questions once in awhile and there is always someone with a piece of knowledge or perspective you may not have about the game.  The collective knowledge of everyone really goes a long way.
---
There is a lot of genuine excitement anytime a new release comes out too.  Most customer service reps play the games, so they may not be experts, but they aren't going in totally blind either.
---
i hope so!
---
This. They removed a few qol portals and people completely spazzed out. Once you get easy mode it's very very difficult to go back. Levelling is a complete mess in retail now trying to jam together 7 expacks worth of content, they'll have to do something at some point but god knows what.
---
Hijacking your comment to say YEET
---
I work since 10 years in the same place. I can take 5 weeks of holidays every year whenever I want.
---
But not THIS year. We have a once every 10-15 years big project that will happen this summer.
---
It had to happen the year of Classic Wow Release ... 
---
I would have answered in poetry if I could ;-)
---
I hear u/SoupaSoka and u/spearmints have Beta keys
---
Yes. Determines who you see in cities, AH, trade chat, do top end raiding with. Community
---
Damn, he’s on to something. WOW Beta confirmed today, uploaded by Blizzard!
---
I have a vague memory of leveling my rogue back at the end of vanilla, and it had its ups and downs. For one thing, rogues are squishy--combat or not. Stealth is amazing while leveling, but if what I remember is accurate, it was difficult taking on more than one or two mobs at a time. Sap and other cc are your friends. Perhaps someone else can chime in with more/better information.
---
At the end of the day, I still had quite a bit of fun on my rogue.
---
They also said they wouldn’t re release classic. I agree with you that it is unlikely but I would go 0.00000001%
---
Nice!
---
The beta is coming out yesterday confirmed!!
---

---
Your gut feeling was right... kind of. You still get that upvote like I promised.
---
Save me a spot dude. I'm a shaman, I'll drop that WF for you.
---
OH LAWD IT COMIN'
---
But it hit WOWV, not PTR, 2 weeks before. PTR gets a build for download shortly before the server opens. But PTR CDN never "sets up", as it's been there for years.
---
Which suggests something closer to "NOW". Well, probably not today. And, WOW usually gets Beta updates on Fridays - if Classic is going to follow the schedule, then next week is more likely, because of Easter.
---
Do you have any memories from your office experience you could share? General perks of the job, how stressful the workload was, etc?
---
The first quests (didnt even know what quests where) in the human start area... I had to babysit at my bro’s house and he said: play this if you like untill e come home. Then 4 hours later (time was flying for me) he came back home and I was level 6. I told him what I did and next week I bought my own WoW and joined him. 
---
The next day (after the babysit) I had a students job to work in the garden. We had to work in pairs and I told my work mate about it the whole day and he was like... wtf are you talking about man... Haha the addiction was born in that 4 hours.
---
Howdy!  Back during Wrath of the Lich King I was banned for three days because of I was farming Tempest Keep trash by killing the non-elites and casting invisibility to reset the elites and respawn the non-elites.  During that time I made numerous tickets asking about it and eventually got 3 days of free game time back.
---
My question is in your personal experience and your opinion (with no connection to Blizzard) why would using in-game mechanics result in them banning me?  It has been a question in my head for over a decade with never a real answer.  A few weeks after I was unbanned a patch made trash not respawn anymore the way I was doing it and forced it into a soft reset stage.  I wasn't making insane gold either maybe like 20g every 5 minutes with a few patterns that would sell for another 40g.  I was simply trying to finish off my "collect gold achievement".
---
100%
---
Summer is coming
---
Exciting! The only problem I have with Beta is that anything in CLasic takes a ton of time and effort to achieve, and once a beta is over it all gets wiped.   
---
I don't know if I can jump in use to have stuff disappear and have to restart a month later.
---
LMFAO
---
What are you talking about? How does a Hunter escape a Warrior? He'll just charge and Hamstring again. I swear half the people in this sub never played Vanilla. Warriors is the most gear dependent class for sure, but once they have some decent gear they are very powerful. 
---
&gt; A hunter that dies to a warrior (assuming same lvl, full life etc) should really really reconsider his or her career choice ! 
---
Nothing to back this up, just a broad statement that means nothing. People like you spout this same BS about their favorite class all the time.
---
Overall
---
Time to pay up sonny boy!

LOL BETA IS COMING HAHAHAHAHA IM FUCKING DEAD

Yo you promised you wouldn't tell.

Honestly I've heard the opposite, but I'd love to be a Warrior just for Whirlwind Axe.
---
Unless you were exploiting the game mechanics some how, you were never gonna get punished for PvP.  If something like that were reported we would acknowledge the report and follow up to see if it was in violation of policy and then act accordingly.  
---
Just PvP within game mechanics was always ok, it is World of Warcraft after all!
---
"It's riot time!"
---
I think you are just bad, it's ok though majority of the playerbase is. But classic is a grind no skill required :)
---
Nice man, what server?
---
they updated it with "Nothing yet"
---
Can't stay calm!
---
Well I plan on rolling a Warrior so I will be forming the groups with friends. I was just curious what the consensus is for how to do reserve runs.
---
Do you mean a bear druid or a bear pet ?
---
I don't think any pets had swipe in Vanilla, the only 2 aoe agro effects I'm aware of are screech and the gorilla stomp (1 min CD though).
---
And once TBC was done we got lich king, and then cataclysm, and then MOP, and then Warlords of Dranor. So by your logic, WoD is good and classic.
---
This is all that will be in general/trade chat for at least the first month lol.
---
Doesn't have to have meter or rhymes to be a poem. That's a perfectly good poem IMO. 
---
You're still wrong about hunters being best WPVP class though. Rofl.
---
LEEEETTTTT MEEE INNNNN!
---
I prefer “the banana barbarian”
---
The reason I'm saying that is because people were first looking towards the demo client to say it's a hoax when it was updated yesterday.
---
I think a lot of this depends on how many servers we even get. 
---
I can't see classic getting more than 20 to start. That is over all regions. Figure a 7 - 7 - 6 split for US/EU/Asia. So for US/EU that is 3pvp 2pve 1rp 1rppvp? I can't see 28% of the population being drawn to RP in general. 
---
All these numbers are out of my ass here for sure, but the tl;dr is - how many servers are we getting per region is the most important thing for the inclusion of RPPVP/RP realms.
---
Stupid questions:
---
How soon will we have beta access? Does this mean we have beta access now? Will everyone have beta access or will it be select?
---
GachiPls BfA forsenDED
---
Was a single gm able to ban someone, or did you have to run it by multiple people first?
---
I recently went thru WC on a p server and had flashbacks...had to rely on other people to lead the way.
---
Bear pet had swipe. So it could tank 2-3 mobs.
---
The realistic solution is adding new raid tiers that werent in the game before, and new BGs for the PVPers.
---
OMG
---
Are you kidding ? I mained a warrior in Vanilla, you have much less skills to use than a hunter for example.
---
I can't say which class / spec has the most intense rotation since I didn't play all of them but it's certainly not warrior.
---
&gt; I am more than happy to guildinvite one of the 500 other dps on the server who dont think farming 15g for pots every week is too much to ask.
---
Nope, definitely not elitist.
---
Assumptions like this always strike me as odd, are you basing this off of private server experience? People will be coming and going all the time, populations will fluctuate with content releases and a whole shitload of factors and by 5-6 months in "tourists" will be the least noticeable of them. Also what constitutes a tourist? 5-6 months seems like a pretty long time to continue calling someone a tourist and not just a player. It seems even weirder to not differentiate between a 6 month player and someone who logged in day one and never came back.
---
How so?
---
*Gnomish giggling intensifies*
---
WoD launch was unplayable for like three days.
---
I would say Warrior/Druid and maybe a rogue in PVP scenarios.
---
Hijacking a car to drive home to hijack this post
---
Yes please to RP-PVP servers. There is enough interest to justify at least 1. I feel that it will be a medium pop server at minimum. I believe Blizzard and the community will be surprised how popular it will be.
---
Having played both back then (not to a high level, to be honest), both hunter and warlock were a blast. I won't be choosing either this time around, but if I were to main one of them, I'd choose warlock. Hunter is great, and leveling and pvp are pretty powerful, but warlock brings a lot more to the table in the form of summons, healthstones, soulstone, fear, etc. Plus, warlocks get a "free" mount at 40, and have a super flavorful epic mount quest, which is nice :)
---
Depends who is asking.
---
Man, running around Brill/Tirisfal, people selling bags and offering free enchants to level enchanting. Seeing all the different monsters to fight. All the quests to complete. The first Green item. God damn.
---
Casting time: 1-4 months
---
Ooh does that work? I'm guessing it would have the teleport them before the loot roll ended?
---
Likely in 2-3 weeks.

I said that. :) I meant that strat live is normally done as tank + healer combo. However because healers need the robes, you have leverage over them and normally dont need to share with a healer, because they are there for gear.
---
So you just get crates + unneeded BoPs and make bank, because you dont need to share in UD, whereas in live you have to share with your healer.
---
I'm excited. I loved Mauradon. Doing the entire dungeon felt like an accomplishment, and she was a fun fight to cap it off.
---
This is a different product. I think the timelines will be different too.
---
What about if a beta was spotted on the CDN?
---
So you’re telling me there’s a chance ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
We always logged in through an in house developed interface that connected to the WoW servers when I was there.  It was mostly easy to use and had all the info organized pretty well but it was pretty soul crushing when it crashed on you.  If you ever had a weird long gap in conversation from a GM, really good chance they crashed, lol.
---
There is definitely tiers to the allowable work of a GM.  newer GMs don't handle item restorations, they passed them on to specialists who were far more experienced GMs.  The more Senior GMs handled less regular, more unique issues.
---
As a Tank, I secretly love this.  I see shamans range pull with lightning bolt and immediately earth shock, and I yoink all the aggro with a taunt!
---
...and then of course *occasionally* the taunt will get resisted and I have total deniability "well you shouldn't have over aggroed" /shrug 
---
 :P
---
ANAL [Dirge]
---
&gt; You're still wrong about hunters being best WPVP class though. Rofl. 
---
Huh ?
---
how the fuck do I roll a blood elf, is this game broken or something?
---
well, agreed with "repost", but not content with your way of describing reason.
---
Was there any encouragement from Lead GMs or the such to roleplay, or did GMs tend to do it just for the fun of it? (Which as a RPer myself, I greatly appreciated!)
---
Yes but it didn’t get really good until BC. You could run prot with that reflect spell on your shield and go nuts. It was like leveling is today but 11 years ago.
---
Why OP when he wasn’t the one who jinxed things? - Said by someone after Classic Beta was confirmed
---
For poems my, fellow fallen brother, rhymes are not needed.
---
For your freedom I would definitely have pleaded.
---
Your poem, I can tell, comes from passion and pain.
---
Let us hope that your project shall not be in vain.
---
I know Blackstone is unique so unfortunately you can only hold 1 at a time. It's a real gph loss. Im not sure about the other.
---
Haha nah, GM island was actually pretty boring.  Nothing but a bunch of GM avatars standing around, many of which didn't even have armor on.
---
Mostly there were so many tickets to answer there was always someone to help, we were busy!
---
I don’t have a solution, ilvl and .io are the best metric we have beyond people writing guild applications for your 5 man. 
---
But as a veteran of many raid tiers progressed at the top 5, 20, 50 us level, I can speak for myself when I say I know what I’m doing. However those tiers were years ago. That doesn’t take away positioning, fight understanding (target switching primarily as dps, for example), dodging fire, etc. it takes away knowing every cheesemaster pathway through the dungeon to avoid mobs you body pull anyway 45% of the time. 
---
But my .io doesn’t reflect that. But how could it? It’s the best metric for how good someone is at the current content. I wish it weighted past achievements better, for example (and this shows how old my examples are) if you killed sarth 3d 10 man before 1/1/09, I can pretty much assure everyone you are a good player. 
---
If it was possible to show when you character killed gruul in Bc, if it happened before 3/22/07, I can assume you were good and always will be. 
---
Same with rag (though this one is a bit extreme), if you downed him in Cata before 9/7/11 I’ll  bet you know how to play. 
---
There are all sorts of metrics that should be on your characters data, that in accordance with ilvl and .io can tell if you some is A. good B. Geared enough C. Experienced on the specific content. 
---
At the end of the day, the solution is to get in a guild where a prerequisite for membership is satisfying those.
---
You must not have played with macros lol
---
You just responded to me in another post saying that if a Hunter loses to a Warrior they should reconsider being a Hunter.
---
So what is the usual time between CDN and beta release ?
---
EVERYONE.... GET IN HEARE!!!!
---
It was very common in BWL and AQ+ guilds, but sometimes RNG fucks you.
---
By the time TBC came out, only a handful of our raider Priests didn't have one - partly due to bad luck and partly due to not attending every single raid.
---
To give an idea about RNG, our Top Priest never got their T2 Helm from Onyxia. She was basically a Co-Leader of the Guild and was at almost every single kill from the time we started raiding. Passed on the first couple because she was so geared she "didn't need it" and gave it to recruit Priests who needed an upgrade. IIRC only two of them dropped for us in total.
---
Also about Thunderfury bindings. So many guilds had 1 binding drop and then never get another one for literally ever. Or 2/3 Bindings of one side, and waiting. Or two people waiting with a mishmash ... waiting... waiting.
---
Fun times ahead!
---
I hope they really think about this BETA if it's actually legit, having us enjoy all the 1-60 content (except raids) over a 2-3 months BETA period or whatever will make the official game much less hyped up. It's probably better to limit the players like in the demo but in a different setting, maybe level 10-40 and a few level specific zones.
---
My personal opinion of course.
---
&gt; Feral will have to do 5 times the amount of work to match an equally geared rogue
---
Rogues cannot tank, heal, decurse and dispell poisons. Feral tanks are a nice middleground between prot warriors in terms of mitigation and fury/defiance warriors in terms of threat. They make for great off-tanks that can also DPS/heal/decurse/dispell with proper gearing. MCP farming is not nearly as timeconsuming as you think. You only have to use them for example on pull and on very threat capped bosses/mobs. For more information about feral tanks I advise you to check Taladril's guides and tests, Skarm's raid druid tanking/healing videos (with commentary) etc. And you can simply ask any of the Feral players who are raiding high tier content at the moment or who have done it in the past.
---
&gt; Job easily done by a holy priest
---
That is simply not true. A holy/shadow hybrid is one of the *tradeoffs* you can make to keep up the Shadowweaving debuffs on bosses. But you'll have a less effective healer. A proper Shadowpriest in a Warlock group with 3-4 Warlocks also heals through their damage if they are continously life tapping. With raid statistics of them doing an average DPS of 60-70% of a Warlock (w/o counting the debuff benefits) that means they are doing about 60-70% healing of a raid healer if they get a debuff slot for Vampiric Embrace, which you can do since we'll have 16 slots right of the bat. In some raids they even do the same amount of a raid healer and close to a DPS, depending on how much gear and consumables they have. Shadowpriests are no joke.
---
&gt; Ele prob viable but same as feral has to put in overtime.
---
You are ignoring the fact that they don't strictly have to deal damage. A ele/resto shaman only doesn't have the 10% healing talent and don't have Mana Tide Totem. Their chain heals are very close to a Resto chain heal. This means you again, add flexibility to the raid by having the option to increase raid DPS or raid healing on the fly. It isn't particularly strong pre-ZG/AQ but after that it is a strong option. Also totems. A ele/resto does the same group support as a resto in a melee group since they don't need Mana Tide.
---
&gt; Balance does shit dps and runs out of mana because you aren't allowed to innervate yourself.
---
You are obviously allowed to innervate yourself. The Druids that are innervating others usually have high efficiency builds like Moonglow, since they never run OOM. Balance DPS on long fights is weak, but in short fights they are up to par with normal caster DPS. Have you ever played with one? And the same advantage as the ele shamans apply here too in adding flexibility. If you invite a Druid who *just* wants to do DPS, then yes, that is suboptimal (you are still going to do fine), but a Druid who embraces their hybrid nature and is utilized well can be a good addition.
---
&gt; Is it possible to raid with them? Sure, in that way they are viable. But you are intentionally handicapping your guild because you wanna be a special snowflake.
---
It really depends on what kind of players we're talking about. You are absolutely not gimping/handicapping your raid with a hybrid that puts in the effort and is used the right way depending on the encounter. You can bring overall less dedicated healers but have that flexibility. If you invite somebody who wants to play one of those specs just to feel special, then yes you are handicapping the raid. But that is true for *every* role. A fury Warrior who doesn't put in the work and doesn't get properly supported, doesn't do nearly as much damage as some here think.
---
Well this certainly explains a lot. Thanks.
---
Well this certainly explains a lot. Thank you.
---
How does someone get access to play classic beta?
---
Ugh I LOVE THIS, and it abruptly made me wanna play soooo bad.
---
Right but the point I was making was just that there was an update in the last 20 minutes, so it suggests wheels are moving and we have more recent information than November.  Previous blizzard activity when making changes to the CDN strongly suggests we will have something very soon.
---
Did you witness or hear stories about GM corruption? Such as spawning items for personal accounts or griefing players?
---
Considering that they are adding Maraudon with the launch that all the pre 60 leveling content will be in the game at launch.
---
IIRC it was fixed relatively quickly, so I doubt it’ll work in Classic. I wish I’d recorded soloing the ghoul packs on my Warlock just for the nostalgia.
---
Sign me up!
---
Damn why are your summer breaks so long ?
---
The moment they said summer I started hoping for a September release myself. Post-peak daylight and warmth, would be perfect
---
Arthas died for our sins (of eating grain) and upon the 7th day rose again
---
Assuming they have a vanilla cap that would be 7 x 3000 = 21,000 players online at one time for NA or EU. That's fewer than those that are subscribed to this reddit. I personally expect lots more, and if there's 10 realm, 1 rp-pvp would definitely be warrented if around 7% of all players head there. 
---
Curious to see how popular Classic will be in the end, no one knows :)
---
Ours.
---
I'll take 2 beta keys, please.
---
I think i heard somewhere that priests also can farm DM lashers with holy nova. Can anyone confirm or deny this?
---
I interpreted it as "Druids, who (choose to) spend most of their time raiding in Moonkin form..."
---
God, that look will haunt me!
---
Any early indication if this will run from the main game client or separate instance with this news?
---
Do you have any intention of going eng at 60? Obviously mining is nice to go with then.
---
Hunter: That 10 ap on cruel barb affects ranged attack power right?
---
Hunter: doesn’t matter, I’m rolling need regardless.
---
Aight, bring snacks too and I'll bring an extra blanket and some pornomags for a real nostalgia feel.
---
Decent meme but i had to downvote because I'm a Druid
---
Doubt if he's going to answer this. But from what I've seen, the server is able to command the client to download an arbitrary executable, and that executable then communicates back to the server. This gives a lot of capabilities that Blizzard can use to detect cheating. For instance, the executable can:
---
1. Calculate and report checksums of all the executables and data within the install to detect modified clients.
---
2. Determine the names of all running processes. For legal and privacy reasons, the actual names were not reported back to the server, but instead hashes of the names were reported. If a "prohibited hash" that corresponded to a known cheat program was reported, well.....
---
3. Determine the names of all open windows. Once again, the actual names weren't reported, but only hashes of the names.
---
So this would allow Blizzard to quickly change the executable to detect different things in response to cheaters changing their mode of operation. Additionally, Blizzard's policy wasn't to ban people immediately (doing this would allow cheaters to get immediate feedback on the effectiveness of any counter measures they might use. Much better to keep them in the dark so to speak). After a sufficient amount of time passed, Blizzard would then ban en-mass the flagged cheaters.
---
TL;DR; Warden is simply an arbitrary executable that the server can command the client to download. This executable can then perform any actions that Blizzard deems necessary to detect cheating.
---
I distinctly remember being teleported by a GM because I was spawn camping someone "excessively". It was seen as harassment.
---
You got it brotha.
---
April 17th, 2019: Shit hit the fan.
---
Did you ever come across a case of cross faction collusion? How was that handled? As in an alliance and a horde on a PvP server using third party software to grief a horde or an alliance player.
---
Fwiw I mained a warrior in Vanilla, I really like the class but I'm not blind to its defects in PVP.
---
Explain me how a warrior can reach a hunter and spend quality time with him when this :
---
- improved concussive shot
---
- improved wing clip
---
- scatter shot 
---
- counter attack
---
- ice trap
---
- entrapment
---
- god forbid the hunt is an engineer too !
---
Never been a GM, but I have gone to GM island on official servers once or twice. I think the reason it was so frowned upon is that unlike zones like Hyjal where you could jump over an invisible wall, getting to GM island is not actually possible without heavily editing the client.
---
We would install a custom MPQ patch that would create a land bridge across the ocean, across the fatigue zone and then later across the giant void where the ocean ends. After 15+ min of walking you get to an area with more ocean, and then GM island.
---
In theory the same type of MPQ patch could be use to bypass any kind of geometry in the game such as skippinmg straight to the final boss of any dungeon you wanted to do.
---
Main game client most definitely.
---
Or 69 days.
---
2-3 weeks.
---
Definitely. It's fun to speculate though.
---
Ahhhhhhhhhh FUCK
---
The campign though. 
---
Competitive isn’t the entry point to the game, if we are splitting hairs
---
A lot of gear you’ll want comes from tailoring and your pre-bis requires tailor, as well as a few more pieces of BiS till I think Nax that require 300 tailoring. I personally think the value of having it while leveling and being able to craft some of the very good pieces while leveling (as well as bags, which locks especially want) makes it a really strong choice.
---
How big the world is. I think Vanilla WoW does the best job from any MMORPG I've played that really makes you feel like you are actually exploring a *World* of Warcraft.
---
More specific examples would be the tauren 1-5 zone. I love how once you're ready to leave that, you turn a bend around the giant mesa and are presented with the rolling plains of Mulgore in all their glory.
---
Why a Friday?
---
I rolled a female human paladin because I loved the way the plate armor looked on the model.
---
Is it true you guys were showed this video in training about how players could disrupt the world?
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7LyIOigL7Gg
---
Yeah and I stand by what I said. But I never pretended hunters were best at wpvp. We can continue in the other thread :o
---
There are videos out there showing people crossing the island using "clever use of game mechanics" and not some third party exploit. If I remember correctly you had to jump down from an exact spot in Teldrassil and then swim. You would reach the Island seconds before the fatigue bar ran out.
---
Make sure u roll on hoj cause it has ap
---
Lunacy,
---
You won't be seeing the same players because you wouldn't see any players. But hey enjoy your 1 BG per day community, I guess.
---
This isn't something I'd be into but I do have to say that there clearly is a solid case for 1 RPPVP server in each region. It's not that I'm entirely convinced there'll definitely be a viable population, at least right away, more that it's really just common sense to oblige people with something that will genuinely benefit their experience when all it costs you is an additional server rule-set. I'd be surprised if you guys don't win this one, but keep the pressure up!
---
Thanks for the reply. I just wanted to see if the AMA gentleman knew any of this or how this information was used?
---
I won't play a Paladin, I won't play a Paladin, I *won't* play a Paladin...
---
&gt; probably better to limit the players like in the demo but in a different setting, maybe level 10-40 and a few level specific zones
---
plus some raid testing like it is in expansion beta's
---
and some stress test for a week or two.
---
I leveled 1-50 as a Night Elf (resto) Druid - mostly in Bear form. Killing things was so slow, I could barely kill anything. Escape and survival was my forte. I got bored and unsubbed.
---
Then I rerolled as an Undead Fire Mage. Shit was fuckin' fire.
---
Rather surprised on one hand, and not surprised on another. Surprised that the girl mentioned didn't seem to realize that every action is logged and hence traceable. Not surprised, since there are plenty of people out there who don't seem to realize how stupid they are.
---
You must not have played a hunter lol
---
As someone that thought a beta was an absolute necessity, this makes me very happy.
---
&gt; unless you were a Lead GM, you were very unlikely to show yourself to a player. 
---
How true is this actually? I had a GM show himself to me in the deeprun tram once, and another time teleport me to the GM island where I saw another player too all in vanilla times
---
Ah fuck it, c'mere. 💋💋💋
---
Couldn't they get in trouble for sharing internal drama? I fugure they would shy away from answering but I'm definitely interested too. People just shy away from sharing drama like that with their handle.

One time I submitted a ticket to ask a random question about unit conversion. I wanted to know for sure that EU clients just replaced yards with meters instead of actually converting them (30yd -&gt; 30m, instead of 30yd -&gt; 27m).
---
It took longer than usual, but sure enough within 24 hours I had an official answer in the mailbox.
---
What was the process with random questions like these? How far would you guys go to find the answer?
---
Its only green when I equip +spell damage gear.
---

---
How long after a beta does the full release usually come out or does it differ?
---
June 25th is a week before a major competitor launching an expansion. That seems more likely.
---
Ok, this was the most legendary ticket I ever took.  It really goes beyond the ticket.  I click on it and I read this,
---
'BLIXX!!!!!!  you must do someting bout tha motherfucker who trow you in lava in brm.  I fall in the lava costs me like 4 DEADS like 6 mins LOTS OF TIME DO SOMETHING!!!!! The spriest does this nick mwa marion and it costs me a full UBRS run!!!!!'
---
I forward this to a buddy on my team and he responds to it word for word with an anxious voice and tone inflections.  I can still do this day say it with the tone and I can't get over it.  Unfortunately for the guy submitting the ticket, this issue is working as intended.
---
I do feel a little bad in that I don't want to make fun of his English, but I like to think the funny part to us was how distraught he was over the game mechanics he couldn't slow down for a moment to type "Blizz" correctly, it was doomed from the start.
---
What was the salary?
---
And between beta and full release?
---
Here comes the no beta club
---
Happened to me on a private server. This is what the room looks like: [https://i.imgur.com/bpFdvNg.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bpFdvNg.jpg)
---
Definitely not the main client. The demo was a separate client, and a completely separate install.
---
I dont really get why youre responding to me.  I literally said in my original post that its nice that the beta is there, just that we dont have updated files yet.
---
Was there really a WoW Guantanamo Bay where unruly and uncooperative players would be spawned into a jail cell on an unmapped islandfor a set amount of time and no hearth ability? I remember this being a big rumor among my group back in the day.
---
Should consider priest
---
AAAAAAHDSFIGDFU yeessssss ogmaoa  just YES PLEASE
---
I predict soon
---
Beta comes out in a week or two. 2 months of beta. July 17th Osconty 5d backgammon confirmed. My dad works at Blizzard, I have an inside source.
---
Thanks for the refresher. I forgot why leveling in red ridge was such misery. Now I remember. Horde ganks for days.

As a rogue you could grief in so many ways. Some options:   
---
Sap people as they rush to take a boat or zep. Watch them helplessly miss it while they are sapped :)   
---
Chain CC lowbies without actually hitting them.  
---
Stunlock people as they're doing elite quests, then kill them as they are about to kill the mob.  
---
Run through people of the opposite faction while stealthed. Watch panic ensue.
---
Can you imagine no lifing the beta and getting so burnt out that it kills the hype for launch
---
Being able to play the game &gt; Seeing 19 other people every match.
---
ANAL [For the Children]
---
What were the hours/days like?
---
PVP trinket, Charge/Intercept, Hamstring, Fear. Once the warrior gets on the hunter, the hunter is dead. 
---
Conc shot and Wing Clip are basically useless against the Warrior because of Hamstring.
---
START THE DAMN BETA BEFORE I PISS MESELF
---
Warriors scale best, rogues scale very well, too.
---
So do mages and warlocks.
---
Classes which scale poorly are hunters, shadow priests, etc
---
If she can cook her own she can cook yours too? 2 birds one stone and all that
---
Yes!  Being a GM was a full time 40 hour a week job with benefits!  (presuming they took you on as a full time employee) 
---
I am not exactly sure how classic will handle GMs as a lot has changed since I have worked there, but I would imagine they will be there in some form.  There will always be issues in MMOs people will need assistance with.
---
does anyone have predictions for how we are going to be able to get into the beta?
---
I promise to make a video on this!
---
Ok, so you know how a long time ago someone made that stupid Drake meme where he shuns one version and then below it he approves another and it went viral and has been used to the fucking point your considering putting a gun in your mouth every time you get on Reddit?             
---
              
---
Well about 2 weeks ago I guess someone decided it was so fucking good they made the exact same fucking thing with Winnie the Pooh and this is an even lazier fucking rip off of that and it features Gallywix on r/wow.
---
Waaaaaiiiiitttttt... where are you playing that you killed nef??
---
While I wouldn't purchase it for Classic alone, they do also have Warcraft III remaster coming out soon. With a huge drop in their stock due to the layoffs (their profits were actually great) I would say now is a perfect time to buy, but I wouldn't say it's due to classic alone.
---
Yup, damn. Lots of higher level ones for some reason.
---
/flirt
---
WE NEED TO KEEP OUR COMPOSURE
---
https://youtu.be/oydv8lFPeIY
---
&gt;Oh yeah, loss of employment.  GMs were not meant to interfere with the game in any fashion.  If there was a visible GM spawning something that was either someone going rogue and about to lose their job or a planned event they had a designated Lead GM for.  Helping the player accomplish anything in game wasn't something we could do either.
---
How about smaller things? We once did a Naxx10 raid in Wrath of the Lich king and need of a GM to assist us. He spawned into the raid with us with a character wearing the classic blue and black GM robe. After he had solved the issue for us he summoned a repair bot for us that we could use.
---
I assume this is something that was within a GM's power to do?
---
Only one question matters... release date? (2019 Classic, not 2004... -\_- )
---
Did you ever have to deal with players who were rude to you when you were trying to help them?
---
Sure did,
---
Scholomance was a blast. Such a neat feel and atmosphere. Gotta get the key so you didn't have to wait for someone else to let your group in.
---
Bad news ?
---
It's good to hear a hardcore perspective.  At 5th or 6th (proably higher) in line for every weapon type I wonder if an Undead would ever see an upgrade.
---
In your opinion, would a loot council ever award a weapon outside of this normal priority to "catch up" a fury lagging behind on gear?
---
Get away with this stupid highrate private scum!
---
yeah that is fair and true, but i think we need to include it, in our "ready" part. its expensive and people like me get mining just to save mats and cost for it and use the rest to save for engi. I bet others do the same, since its logical.
---
Not release date though.
---
That’s why I’m not touching it
---
Yooooo you called it sort of
---
Pianist
---
Never seen this, very cool :)
---
Happy Easter!
---
Trying to put aside my biases but I don't honestly think modern WoW will hold much appeal to a brand new player. The people who still play it actively now are mostly very long term players with established guilds and social circles. 
---
It's built on previous expansions, in terms of the storyline, world, and game mechanics. I think you will feel very much like you missed a lot of important things trying to make sense of BFA. I felt that way, and I only skipped a few expansions when I tried it out. 
---
Since its 2019 and Classic is coming out, start with the original WoW! If you hate it, give retail a try.
---
ARCANITE REAPER HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
What happens when The Unstoppable Force hits The Immovable Object?
---
You don't have to have a progression beta test. They can say "STV needs more testing" and give everyone the option to get a level 35 character for it.
---
If I had to make my best guess, what is happening here is a Lead GM is handling a unique issue that need more understanding about.
---
Normal tier GMs almost never showed themselves to players unless they were going rogue for some reason.  Leads on the other hand would jump in when a normal tier GM had an issue out of the scope of what they were in power to solve.  Leads knew it was rare for a GM to show themselves, so they typically had fun with it when they did!
---
F
---
What I meant was advertise ring drops for like 25g.  Take some dude with you to stand at the entrance and run it a few times till it drops.
---
Sorry, I don't believe that crap. People who claim they did criticize in a friendly and polite manner and got banned for it usually are just lying and were actually flaming their teammates. 
---
I see that kind of "friendly criticism" all the time and also dish it out as well when it's appropriate, and never have I seen anyone get banned for that and never got banned myself.
---
Just by registering for WoW betas on battle.net is my guess
---
and Blizz will probably give keys to this subreddit, /r/wow, mmo-champion, wowhead and other gaming sites for giveaways
---
In vanilla you compete between your class, realm or worldwide. You don't look at other classes since it's not that well balanced.
---
I'm a lock myself currently too and always parse top3 of my server, and yes I do this with flasks, but top3 or top10 isn't really relevant in this case here. The point was that casters do not fall back as far as melee do when they do _not_ have the time to actually get all of these consumables, in which case you will have 200+ melee outdps you, but you can still handle yourself pretty well as a lock.
---
My plan is to roll several characters to get the names I want. 
---
Then pick my main, and start levelling. Either a hunter or a shammy. 
---
My main was a hunter back in vanilla and I finished playing a resto shammy.
---
This comment is both awesome and completely nerve wracking.. :D
---
That would be nice, though most Bliz betas have been pretty open.
---
someone TELL ME usually how long after a beta does the actual game release?
---
tidal charm
---
Yeah, but the cooldown on it is atrocious.
---
Lol that’s spooky
---
It depends on what you're looking for in a game. Try to research what both versions of the game are like from unbiased sources and make a decision based on your tastes. Personally, I detest current WoW and don't see myself ever returning to it in any meaningful way unless Blizzard does a 180 on many design decisions, and fully intend to play Vanilla, but my tastes do not necessarily mirror your own.
---
Haha no :(
---
Did get a few comped accounts though while I worked there, that was sweet!
---

I'm already done with my April holidays. Now, just waiting. Whenever you release, whatever you post, I will be right here waiting for you.

YOU ARE NOT PREPARED

DONG EXPAND
---
Thank you!  I had no idea there would be this much interest, I am glad everyone encouraged me to get in touch with the mods and make it happen!
---
Bringing back the feels for sure!
---
So what your saying is we should bug the mods.
---
Gathering profs are good gold makers while levelling. I’ll worry about crafting once I am 60 and can farm my own mats.
---
Yo i think this was specific to wpvp. Pvp trinket isn't usually a leveling wpvp scenario.
---
What? Does the game usually go from a beta to the actual game releasing over night?
---
Twink is gay slang for a young man in his late teens to early twenties whose traits may include: general physical attractiveness; little to no body or facial hair; a slim to average build; and a youthful appearance that belies an older chronological age.
---
&gt; less patients if it all happens to be a shitshow on launch...
---
Good thing its a game and not a hospital/clinic, then.
---
The main thing is we had was the insta kill button, at the end of the day it's all we ever needed.  We could teleport around too, but that was a chat command if I recall correctly.  Generally we would just spawn into where we needed to be, or warm to the player we needed to help.
---
Fair answer. Retail is better for the ultra casual or ultra hardcore crowd, but doesn't have much in between.
---
I’m so hyped i actually MISS THAT SPAM
---
Well. Uh. We got somewhat confirmation of a beta. Keep it up.
---
Reditors being bros
---
Hell, even without using this crazy thing called a calendar....a fair amount of the midwest just had a blizzard a week ago.
---
Where im from March is barely coming off the 'worst' of winter, and you've still got some time to go.
---
I'm gonna take credit for this one boys. I drunk-subbed to wow last night thinking there was a beta for classic up already but with limited play time or something\*
---
Anyone I unsubbed right away and wrote "WTF WHERE IS CLASSIC BETA" in the reason box.   
---
You're welcome

April 18th, 2019: Shit is still hitting the fan
---
I'm gonna play survival spec as a hunter
---
[www.thottbot.om](https://www.thottbot.om)
---
once they're finally done with that datamining. Hopefully the beta...
---
Lots of men ended up in shallow graves too... or with their pp thrown into a field
---
BFA was April through August. But keep in mind this is a re-release so it may differ
---
I'd say hunter
---
Hopefully everyone who paid to get into the demo during blizzcon gets into the beta...
---
Is it possible to get a wow beta invite if i dont have an active sub?
---
90% of this sub is pro Post-Naxx content.
---
Has there been some sort of registration process for the Beta?
---
I don’t remember seeing one.
---
Would love it if came out sooner than later, but from past releases, I'm guessing August.
---
Rather have a *Soon* ^TM than nothing
---
Healing as a priest can be pretty straight forward. 
---
Just know that the mana regen mechanic is never really explicitly taught to players explicitly, though:
---
So you'll want to let her know what her mana won't start regenerating until 5 seconds after her last cast while in combat, though, so she'll have to get used to healing, then using her wand for a while to regen and then only cast a heal again when necessary to minimize going out of mana (this is really a thing with any healer in the game, though).
---
If you are playing as a team then a tank and healer is a great idea. You can do elite quests together.  Also as you get higher, 5 man instances will be easy as you only need DPS. 
---
Holy priest and Resto Druid are good classes for new healers.
---
Yup, it IS pretty fucked up. People claiming "MUH THEY GOT IMMORTALIZED" haven't even remotely understood the purpose of things like funerals or similar ceremonies. 
---
Just shows the state of the subreddit when it comes to basic human decency.
---
For pve warlock is very easy. Easy leveling easy raiding. Basically 1 button for pve rotation and while leveling has pet for some forgiveness and very smooth leveling experience. For pvp nothing is necessarily simple.
---
Oh yeah, many many many bans.
---
For awhile I was on RMT banning duty.  Basically you comb the queue for people spamming major cities and get them outta there as quickly as possible.  Most of the time it's fine and you move onto the next, occasionally they would fight back.
---
It probably started with banning some bots.  Then a wave of tickets came in with someone saying 'FUCK THE GMs' in Ironforge'  ok got him out there and those tickets.  10 minutes later, another wave 'FUCK THE GMs MOTHERS' get him out, 10 minutes later, 'FUCK THE GMs MOTHER AND FATHER'  get him out, 10 minutes later, 'FUCK THE GMs MOTHER AND FATHER AND SISTER'
---
yeah the war between the RMT and Blizzard is real, lol.
---
I find it really interesting how many similarities there are between how Blizzard had the GM team set up and how private servers have it set up. The server I play on use a similar setup with a client modified for GM use, and different GM tiers with permissions as to what they can assist players with.
---
🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Still hunter and mage.
---
Lemme guess this is coming off a female dwarf?
---
I think priest. Druid healing is simple, but there's a lot of buttons in the rest of the class.
---
This is another change that makes sense. No changes crowd shouldn't be as mad, because it isn't a new change, it's just putting in a logical change a little bit earlier.
---
HOLD UP HOLD HOLD. WHAT?
---
Things like funerals and ceremonies like that are NOT there to immortalize the deceased, it's to help the people cope with their loss. 
---
And personally I think there can't be a bigger display of a complete absence of empathy than this. Completely mocking the way people chose to try to cope with a horrible loss. Doesn't get much lower than this.
---
MOOOOODS!
---
How do you go about attaining the position of Game Master? If you are a GM, are you still allowed to participate in in-game activities such as pve and pvp?
---
Currently seems that the only thing new is an empty branch for the classic beta. No files have been uploaded to the branch, so it's hard to judge what's gonna happen.
---
Good read. I got pretty excited and the nostalgia of lightbringer. Most scandalous server.
---
I can finally justify re-activating my battle.net account!
---
you need to have enough youtube subscribers
---
I better get invited, Blizzard!
---
The purpose of ceremonies like this is not to immortalize the deceased, it's to help the bereaved cope with the loss. 
---
And what was done here is just people completely shitting on the way others tried to cope with their loss. No sign of basic human decency whatsoever.
---
Bring a edgelord shadow priest
---
Paladin. Feels strong while levelling, has good healing and some cooldowns for emergencies. 2 dps buttons, 2 heal buttons, 2 buffs, stun and cleanse and you'll make it through to 60 and be dungeoning/raiding no problems.
---
The idea that the game will play exactly the same as it did in original vanilla is a bit outlandish.
---
Ironfoe on shaman isn’t even a meme, I’m pretty sure warlords have been hanged at The Hague for less
---
Macros were definitely a thing.  Every GM used macros out of necessity, there is never a need to type out a response to 'So and So called me X name' when one answer will catch all of it.  Also many of the times they don't like the answer and the macro covered what the GM could do, but the fact it comes off less personal hurts the situation.
---
This is the main thing though as a GM is I feel you need to read the customer.  Sometimes you need to know don't macro this one, they are really upset and they need a more human touch.  Maybe around 75% of the time that solved all problems, and sometimes people are upset and call you a robot no matter what, cause at the end of the day we are limited in power also.  We are bound to the policy we are there to uphold.
---
First WPVP does not mean leveling up. Second, yes it is once the ranking system comes out. You have to kill like 10 people to get it and there are almost no low level trinkets, so you'll have a spot for it.
---
You don’t think that seals will be too complicated for her?
---
Everyone forgets about [Dirge]

brb bio
---
We are getting Classic thanks to private servers and they have offered some a damn epic gaming experience through the years. More than you can say about retail for the last 10 years...
---
Im pretty sure i have been invited twice (Legion, one of the first waves in BFA) without having a sub, but i did have a sub active for close to all of Legion
---
I kinda wish there was a specific option for Classic, but oh well.  Heres to hoping!
---
South America sucks to level in. Constant PvP.
---
You’re saying it’d require quite a backend overhaul in order for discrete servers to “flex” during the first couple weeks via sharding?
---
I suppose, and I’m ignorant of networking things, I would think servers of today have a load limit of say 10,000. Blizzard wants their servers at a max of 2500 for Vanilla. However, let’s say we all believe there will be a “tourist effect” at the beginning. So could i suppose I thought blizzard would have the ability to temporarily increase the max concurrent, shard off the affected zones for stability and gameplay reasons, then as players disperse in game and back to other games blizzard reduces sharding (ultimately turning off sharding) and lowers the concurrent to 2500. Potentially leading to lintermittent queues (as was the case once a number of realms in classic...so authentic...yay?) 
---
Because tech is so much better, I’m even hopeful some deployment of technology could allow the entire server to be chugging along fine for aq gates opening, which was a laggy mess on live. 
---
That said, do we know if blizzard will have individual servers for classic? They’ve been pretty open how they are ripping 1.12 data into modern WoW framework. Why not make out individual servers a smoke screen? Make it so we can’t communicate with other servers, just turn those bits of code off—comment it out, or so,etching—but allow for that global dynamic server flexing to happen for stability. 
---
Needless to say I’m high and that was like a stream of consciousness question...so sorry.
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
Ahh, I get it, so another “retail sucks, yay vanilla!” post? Thank god, because there’s a shortage of them on this subreddit
---
/s
---
But in all honesty, nothing is off limits in the name of humor, but I wish people put more effort into this. Make it clever, or take an unexpected turn... not this 🙄
---
Anyway, my rant is toward the post, though - thank you, sir, for explaining it to me 😋
---
Ive never looked into it too much, though i dont really remember hearing about  the skulls and stuff in dungeons.
---
The big thing ive seen quite a few times before is the undead models, which quite a few people actually prefer.
---
They won't be. And if likes the idea of healing, paladin sounds like the perfect class for her.
---
This. Its not the content that demands consumes, its the competition. Its fun to compete with the other players in your class. I find using consumes fun.
---
Did it include all that
---
&gt;!stuff with nobles!&lt;?
---
Or was that a side quest?
---
I used to go there all the time to farm the elves for runecloth. I also loved the aesthetic. I think I actually like how lonely and desolate it was.
---
If you're horde, you should try to be 60. Wrythalak run 5-man with a weak team is a long, tough run. 5 60s makes it much less painful.
---
Healing. You’d have to be a complete monkey to mess that up.
---
I guess New Zealand and the pacfic islands will be an expac?
---
I hope your right, cant wait
---
Yep, that was the Alliance version of it.
---
ah i guess ony would be first, and i wasn't counting UBRS and LBRS (which are 10 man if i remember correctly?)  what else would be before zg?
---
Gooby pls
---
Don't do this to me gooby
---
Personally, I'll be avoiding it. I know the grind to 60 is arduous and I'm not keen on beginning the burnout early.
---
Confusion over item restorations was pretty common, but it was sorta let vague to not encourage recklessness.
---
In reality, the Blizzard customer support staff wanted happy players and would exhaust every resource available to them to help a player out.  At the same time we were swamped and we had to discourage people from leaning on us to much either, so I get why it was that way.
---
This is it boys.
---
Yes undead can go from Tirisfall to Silverpine to Hillsbrad with no issues at all.
---
Ah I played Alliance in Vanilla.
---
I booked a Vegas trip in early august.. I hope it releases in june or early july
---
That title needs refinement

I think the whole problem with how people are viewing this is precisely because they're transposing things the other way, from irl to WoW. Transposing is not an effective argument. Do I transpose the morality of shooting people in the face in counter strike to irl? No, that would be stupid. Video games that pit players against each other are just various forms of checkers. Your character doesn't experience pain, there are respawns, etc.. In irl I'm completely opposite of how I am in game. I don't even like killing bugs. I take them outside.
---
I'm not going to write another essay, so I'll just leave at transposition not a good argument.
---
On your B.Net account, there's a settings tab for beta opt in.
---
Presumably you just have to opt in to Warcraft betas.
---
This is it. This is why this sub is here. On horde, undead has the smoothest leveling travel imo.
---
IMO Druid healing is the most complicated. You don't have good spells to spam in the same way that paladins and shaman do, and you don't have the powerful heals of the priest. You have to leverage various downranks on a very long cast heal combined with opprotunistic use of two different regens to help you survive the 5 second rule in order to keep your mana up.
---
I mean... These guys do have a point. I can see you're just venting but your approach was rather childish. That's why these people aren't with you imo
---
Played on RP-PVP from Vanilla through Legion. Technically still am, but my toons there are dormant and that server is now a literal ghost town.
---
That naming policy is essentially never enforced. With the minimal amount of staffing blizz has for GMs I can’t see it ever getting enforced regularly.
---
MODS MODS MODS MODS
---
Seriously?? This is such a weird question. Of course GMs are paid.
---
Do this. Do it as well as can and then either prove everyone wrong or admit your error and just follow conventional wisdom.
---
Hey reddit, remember to smash that like button, comment and subscribe to my YouTube channel to ensure I get a key so I can show you all the classic wow goodness!
---
So, as someone who has never really played a BETA version of a game before, no progress is saved / anything you do on a BETA version will not transfer over to the actual game when it is released correct?
---
I can confirm it, however you need a certain amount of mana (i think it's 6k) so you can cast a certain amount of Holy Novas (i think it's 9-10). [Here's a video of someone doing it](https://youtu.be/0aY-PaThavU?t=214) but he has a special spec for it, I wouldn't recommend respeccing for farming but it should be doable with a normal spec.
---
Looking forward to it!
---
"Buy Adderall" - "hey guys tips out here"
---
I cannot wait to beta a game I've already played for over 2000h.
---
Hold the phone. Is it really? 
---
Because like... In all seriousness...
---
Adding Kara and other originally intended things would be cool.
---
At this point (2005)ish Blizzard only had headquarters in America I believe. The federal minimum wage then was well over $3/hr. Not sure what country you live in
---
Why do people who lack understanding thing that those of opposing opinions base their self worth on video games?
---
I'm playing it 100%.
---
Mage.

Frost bolt -&gt; frost bolt -&gt; frost nova -&gt; frost bolt -&gt; frost bolt  
---
or if fire because you hate yourself  
---
fireball -&gt; fireball  -&gt;  fire blast -&gt; frost nova -&gt; fireball.   
---
Healer would be paladin. You have 2 healing spells
---
Maybe, but also sharding a database is when you split a long list of data into several pieces spread over several machines to be able to access more data quicker, and put less strain on the database overall.
---
I'm leveling my sword skill, hope you don't mind
---
For retail (though it's not the same), expansion betas are usually up for a bit after launch even.
---
correct
---
I've been struggling to decide if to play on a private server of some kind to fill in the gap between now and Classic, having fallen out with BFA.
---
If I was to be invited with a beta it'd be pretty much perfect for me, it'd be like playing on a private server that has Blizzard's quality, and could even do so good for the real product when it's released.
---
Sort of yes!
---
This is where me being a super die hard when I was off the clock kinda helped out.  The Leads knew I was a guild leader of dedicated raiding guild and it lead to opportunities to get to play test a few things other didn't get to.  I got to play test the World dragons before they came out for example and it was really cool.  
---
There is a structure for all of that though that goes through Quality Assurance (Game testers) and in this case they just needed a bunch more testers so the normal testers could have more data.  That was about the extent of it for me as a GM.
---
.die correct?
---
Sorry I don't quite get what you're saying by this.
---
Are you saying Ironfoe is good or bad.
---
Think of them as Old School RuneScape vs RuneScape 3..
---
Is this fucking happening I’m crying
---
I mean I just figure i'd get bored following the herd, especially if I am going to be playing for months.
---
I really hope it does not include the plague. The awesomeness of the plague came from its surprise. It was a totally unexpected event the realization of which slowly spread over the whole of WoW. It was a perfect example of emergent behavior. As a historical event it was fascinating.
---
However, as an intentional event, it's just plain dumb. The whole city dies, nothing you can do, gg. Good intentional events were things like the AQ opening and the various holidays that players can actually meaningfully interact with.
---
Any attempt at recreating the Hakker plague with everybody knowing and understanding why it was so fondly remembered is missing the whole point of why it was such a memorable event.
---
Male Gnome
---
most semi-hardcore guilds give zero shits about consumes, clear MC in 45 minutes, and award raid spots based on attendance and whether or not you actually fit in. I have no qualms with the hardcore scene, I used to be a part of it, but myself and many likeminded people would rather spend a little more time clearing if it means getting to do it in a relaxed setting with people we genuinely enjoy playing with.
---
I’m rushing 2 accounts to 5 the second account is going straight to main city to be an AH mule. If line. Is as cheap as it should be I’ll be making wands until that characters rest bar is full push it to lvl 10 then continue making wands while waiting on rest bar also dipping into wool bags when I start getting that from questing my main.
---
Google Kronos 3.
---
Wall jumping, mount exploiting through walls, fearing with PvP, and summoning.  AQ40 outside was pretty neat but pretty incomplete.
---
While I’m not against them, per se, nor would I want to take this away from people that really want it.....how many of you really played primarily on an RP-PVP server in Vanilla?
---
How many of you are *actually* going to play there?
---
I played on one in Vanilla. Twin Emps never died. I don’t think any end wing bosses in Naxx died. Those all had server firsts in TBC. 
---
Leveling was really quiet. I eventually was forced to join a leveling guild because zones were kinda just dead. In Vanilla. 
---
I’ll never really argue against it, as it’s not my fight to win or lose, but as someone that *lived* on one, I understand Blizzards point of view.
---
As someone that *lived* on one, I never really saw any substantially impactful role play occur. 
---
As someone that *lived* on one, the RP aspect seemed essentially nonexistent. 
---
Ymmv I guess.
---
This one is a copy/paste from above but I really do love this story:
---
Ok, this was the most legendary ticket I ever took. It really goes beyond the ticket. I click on it and I read this,
---
'BLIXX!!!!!! you must do someting bout tha motherfucker who trow you in lava in brm. I fall in the lava costs me like 4 DEADS like 6 mins LOTS OF TIME DO SOMETHING!!!!! The spriest does this nick mwa marion and it costs me a full UBRS run!!!!!'
---
I forward this to a buddy on my team and he responds to it word for word with an anxious voice and tone inflections. I can still do this day say it with the tone and I can't get over it. Unfortunately for the guy submitting the ticket, this issue is working as intended.
---
This isn’t a funeral lmao.
---
People used to solo the slimes and ghouls, and there was also a way to split packs in the deathknight wing and kill one of them. All of it was fixed before the end of Vanilla.  
---
Might still be able to farm frozen runes as a stealth class though.
---
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODS!
---
Of cource, because it could actually help me to decide what class i want to main. I still can't decide Q\_Q
---
Ok ok stay calm. We train for this. Alert all slewping cells. Code red code red!!!!
---
There is a huge difference between pubg and WoW though... stream sniping and some bandwagonning will happen but it's never been like that in any mmo, the culture is just not the same. I know people have mentioned Azmon getting swarmed in the demo but that was the demo. The demo might as well have been a special event, not a normal every day stream.
---
Brilliant. You can get real subtle with it too, like only soulstoning Druids.
---
Im so happy to see this I’ve spent WAY too much time everyday watching videos and reading clsss guides. Stayed off pservers to preserve the experience. 
---
ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!!!!! CHOooo CHOoooooo!
---
Was a game master. Not currently.
---
LOL excellent, thank you for sharing.
---
This HAS to be coming out this or next month.
---
This month is the most likely scenario.
---
A Beta that lasts a few months is literally pointless.
---
I wouldn't be surprised at all if it dropped later this month.
---
LEMME In even through i want to no life the final game not the beta
---
I’m making an alchemy alt so I can transmute my own arcanite, so I’m just as guilty.
---
Tomorrow
---
Correct, it only speaks for 99% of the vanilla community.
---
Could easily happen honestly. I levelled two characters on pserver recently (all 2019 play) and need to fucking chill for a while because I’m kinda burnt out.
---
How is your day?
---
RP-PvP didn't come in vanilla until much later, which may have affected that. I doubt we'll have those same issues 15 years later.
---
I am glad you are enjoying the thread!
---
Yea this is a big thing. Its gonna be a short beta, they will need to give some sort of boost or instant 60 if they want ANY decent amount of feedback on high level content.
---
Just like Game of Thrones, I prefer to hold off and be able to indulge when the dust settles.
---
Did you make this whole thread because you think AQ patch came out after 1.12?!?
---
ROFL
---
For the greater good of mankind!
---
plus power shifting as a required playstyle just to do mediocre dps is one of the least satisfying things I've ever experienced.
---
Generally I would say the player base is very positive.  The real negative people are way less than 5% and most are understanding and appreciative if you quickly get them help.
---
There are people who can't be won over though, and you just need to do your best to try and serve them and empathize with them
---
Can’t fucking wait to never get the email. Haven’t had a WoW sub for a few years and haven’t given them money since OW launched so I’m sure I’m way down whatever priority they use. Also missed the one time I got a real beta invite (for MoP, few months after quitting cata - didn’t see the email until it was already over)
---
I meant what I said. You should do it.

---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
---
If you plan to raid tailoring is very good, you can make good starting gear with the shadow set in the 50s and even some PR BiS gear if you get the recipe. 
---
I wouldn't bother trying to level tailoring until max level, just save all your cloth and do it at 60 when you can farm easier and while waiting for dungeons or bgs.
---
Interesting. Someone gave me gm powers on a pserver once. I had a move called finger of death that shot red lightning to everyone in the area killing them. So I figured as much. Thank you.
---
Alliance for easier raids and premade PvP, Horde for open world / solo PvP.
---
I'm going to use distract them that when pats are **IN. YOUR. WAY.**
---
Do you think a token will be purchasable, but at a Classic gold value? Basically have a token cost 250g or something instead of 130,000g on retail?
---
If so, I'd probably just get a second account and run a sniper AH addon on the second account in the background. The next question will be if there will even be AH addons capable of doing sniping...
---
RP-PvP realms are still comparative ghost towns now. 
---
Not sure why that would change.
---
Take my upvote! Hype Stretcher!!!!
---
WHAT
---
I intend to be  a hardcore raider, and seeing how hunters are popular , and only need a few in raids. what would you reccomend where guilds come begging to me on there knees to raid for them? :)
---
The ticket queue is so massive it's hard to remember people.  There are also so many GMs it's rare to get the same one twice although it does happen occasionally.
---
There is definitely a mix of both, we just see it more as records.  There are some people who had notes on their account that looked like Bart Simpsons permanent recorded, practically nickel and diming their way to dubious account situations.
---
Then you occasionally notice this person is regularly submitting tickets, so long as they are in the right for doing so it won't be discouraged, but if they are wasting our time we tended to politely let them know.
---
That's fair. I might have been a bit too harsh.
---
I don’t think there will be tokens. I’m running a second sniper account because there’s some items specific to warrior I get an advantage in price if I get them early. Also I don’t like grinding so I’d rather play the market while leveling and enjoying my main.
---
I was definitely invited to BFA beta without being subbed. I’m hoping the same thing happens for Classic. I’d actually *use* that beta invite.
---
because if there is no BETA it might be released sooner. I get that sentiment because if Classic mirrors retail in timeline April BETA means August release which is zzzzzzzzzz
---
Every time I've interacted with GMs, any any video I've seen of GMs, they've used A LOT of smileys in their chat. Is this part of your training to disarm us a bit?

Oh no no no PepeLaugh
---
You need a Phantom Blade because it saves you from needing to use the tracking move incase the rogue Vanishes. You also won't have to Spam AoE to find me again if a buddy uses a cleanse or something on me. 
---
Thateans you can not only kill my priest buddy who I abandon once I'm safe but *me* as well. You'll be a hero to gnomes everywhere if you play Alliance.
---
Now? (RP-)PvP doesn't excist anymore. 
---
Regardless, the Classic community can't be compared with that of retail. And when looking at the polls, it's very evident RP-PvP will be more popular this time around. Even if they do end up a ghost town, we've only got ourselves to blame then :)
---
This guy has it. Very early on you could get other T2 in MC, but that was changed about 5 months after launch in 1.4 when the Honor system was added.
---
I am thinking Classic releases (like everyone else does) in July, with 8.2 in June. This would stomp both ESO and FFXIV Xpacs.  I also hope they give us Beta by either 10 levels, or Zones, so people don't burn out on the 1-60 open beta.
---
Release by the end of June! My only free time before semester starts! Please!!!!!!
---
Launch day will be the most packed the starting zones had ever been in history. Vanilla WoW didnt need sharding before because they have never experienced what they're about to experience.
---
Vanilla WoW had a lot of noobs. Want the noobs to make it past week 1? Alleviate some of the stress because most people will quit if Hogger quest takes many hours because hundreds are sitting there waiting.
---
Sharding for low level zones and dynamic respawns for 10-20 zones for just the first week.
---
My first character was a Tauren, and exploring all of Mulgore was super exciting. From running across the plains, swimming across Bloodhoof Lake, and exploring the Venture Co. mine/gnoll cave. I was already hooked. I finally steeled myself to make the trek from Thunder Bluff to Orgrimmar.  Crossing into the Barrens and seeing the the level 17-19 mobs in red scared me, but I knew I would return in the near future more powerful and ready to take on the challenge. Reaching Durotar and the red dusty ground was intimidating as well, but was relieved to see mobs my level. Orgrimmar. Like everyone else walking in the first time was awesome, especially after making the long journey from Mulgore. I took my time exploring every building and area, and stumbled upon a swirling portal in the Cleft of Shadows. Curious of course, I waked through and noticed several mobs I had never seen before and was surprised to see the gold dragon around their portraits. I was sure they had super awesome loot. I attacked one, but realized my mistake too late.
---
It was then that I realized how truly awesome and dangerous WoW was, knowing that this was just the tip of the iceberg compared to all the other zones and enemies that awaited.
---
I will play something I have played a dozen times before in Vanilla and on Pservers. An Ally warrior.   
---
I will not be playing the horde class I plan on maining in classic.   
---
1. I don't wanna ruin the experience.    
---
2. I know a lot about the game from that perspective. I can give good feedback.
---
They literally banned the entire Nihulum guild for 2 or 3 days for killing the world first Lich King using a bug they thought was a mechanic. I don't think they ever got an answer why they were banned
---
17 hunter vs 25 druid lmao never forget
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ SUMMON THE BETA INVITES ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
Many of the arguments for late summer involve the idea that Blizzard would want to give people enough warning to take vacation.  In all probability this is not something they even think about as a very small % of people take time off for video games. There's really no reason they wouldn't be willing to launch classic with only 4-8 weeks notice.
---
Sure their marketing department needs some time to advertise it, but there's also advantages to a gradual marketing campaign. In particular it would help them grow the number of servers more gradually than having 400k people sign up on day 1.  It would also let them keep marketing costs low until they see how popular it really is and then they can crank up the campaign later as appropriate.
---
Even if they waited for E3 (Jun 11) to announce a date that doesn't rule out July.
---
GIVE IT TO MEEEEEEEE

What was the pay like?

Was it a paid position? If so are you allowed to disclose what your salery was? :p

You really only need one seal on your bars. She can add utility seals later if she wants but it’s never really expected or necessary.

Can you reply to this question in 6-24 hours? I want it to feel authentic.
---
Ban me... idc... this gave me a boner
---
Same question. Also, anyone know how long betas are typically?
---
pretty easy to get, which is awesome for priests because you don't replace it until the aq patch (aq20 exalted rep reward + AV offhand)
---
Jeez, guys.  
---
Show some patience...  
---
...  
---
LET ME IN TOOOOOOOOOO
---
Perhaps NZ is in the next expansion pack.....
---
I guess I should have been specific about that. I'm not playing my main class either. Gonna play the same class I played in vanilla for the beta (mage)
---
I have 2 vanilla accts and a retail acct Id better get one
---
That makes sense. I only PvP for fun, but if you are serious with PvP, then it makes sense to go for the best racials.
---
I can't handle the anticipation anymore lol.
---
Rp-PvP realms absolutely exist in the live game. What are you talking about?
---
Polls here mean little compared the intended audience. 
---
Way to circumvent all of my factual questions though.
---
He must mean pvp Hunter.  Raiding as a hunter was a snooze fest.
---
Not 99 percent of progression raiders.
---
Jesus. Theorycrafting is great and all but go suck a tittie or something
---
My best days of childhood in one picture.
---
It required confirmation from a manager.
---
Generally it required 2 seconds worth of dialogue to push through as most were very cut and dry like bots of RMT.  Anything involving a real player would require the GM to justify how they got there.
---
Ragnaros: Die
---
Spelladin: Could you use it in a sentence please?
---
Ragnaros: Die, insect!
---
Spelladin: Country of origin?
---
Ragnaros: I uh.. the eternal hellish realm of the Firelands!
---
Spelladin: Die, D I E, Die.
---
Ragnaros: uh yes that is correct.

Soda made new characters recently and had to server hop every 5 min because a crowd would start to get out of control in mere minutes.

---
This is the point that Blizz wakes up to brown paper bags of shit in their lawns.. not from me obviously I'm not gonna break the law. I'm just saying accidents happen
---
How much power did they give you to give gifts or right wrongs etc..?
---
I'm gonna finish Red Cloud Mesa then head on over to Valley of Trials then Deathknell, then Solidan Pumpkin Farm, then Brill, then Zen'jin Village and Razor Hill, then back to Bloodhoof Village to finish off all of Mulgore.
---
Will likely pickup Skinning and Mining and eventually drop mining for enchanting.
---
The main thing is they encouraged us to put a bit of our own personality and style into the GM presentation while hitting the bases they wanted.  That's why some GMs had an RP opening and others didn't, there was meant to be a level of authenticity.
---
Play something other than what you plan to main.
---
Hunter. You have the easiest time leveling with your pet and your mobility. You hard counter rogues, probably the most used class in world PvP so they'll have a hard time ganking you. In BGs, you're fine in both pugs and premades, as far as I know. I think the biggest downside to hunters is that your damage doesn't scale as good as the other raid DPSs, but I think that affects mostly PvE raiding in mid-late vanilla. Feel free to correct me there.
---
Rogue is nice for open world PvP but they're less useful in premade PvP if you're into that. Also, they're one of the worst solo levelers, probably the worst. A warrior can still hamstring kite with a slow weapon, but you can't. Compare that to hunter, who has by far the easiest time leveling.
---
I think your best alternative is Warlock. Compared to hunter, you'll be more useful in raids but that doesn't seem to be your priority. You have no mobility so leveling is a bit slower.
---
I don't know much more than that, I hope it helped a bit.
---
It didn't. Click the "classic" filter on wowhead to use wowhead for classic, otherwise you get later versions of all items etc.  
---
It gave +4 thorns damage
---
I'm gonna slow turn just to piss people off.
---
Yeah I would gladly test and submit bug tickets. I’ve already played the game, there’s nothing to spoil at this point.
---
It could be a good chance to try out a couple of characters and decide what you really like.
---
Ah, I see. As a player I loved it, it made GMs feel almost as if they were part of Azeroth themselves, and gave them an aura of mystery :)
---
Warrior Stance Dancing is the most buttons to push in Vanilla outside of a Shaman with all the totems.
---
Exactly. People who are hyped for the beta should just play on a private server right now if they don't mind potentially burning themselves out before the real thing
---
How did game masters find out if people were buying / selling gold ?
---
best class for lvl 30 stv shenanigans, lads?
---
HAARRRY DID YOU PUT THE WOW CLASSIC BETA ON THE CDN???
---
Any links? How do they reset instance?
---
For the most part no.  There was someone in my training group who was allegedly fired for deleted someone from their server they got into a fight with items.  I heard about it 2nd hand so take it with a grain of salt, but anything messing with the integrity of the game was an instant firing.
---
&gt; The federal minimum wage then was well over $3/hr
---
it's before tax, though, isn't it?
---
Would you consider being a GM again if asked (for classic)? I imagine they'd let folks do that job remotely these days, rather than having to report to a building. I'd definitely say yes to this, if not just purely for the nostalgia.
---
100% would test. Wouldnt play alliance, or warrior, my planned main, but Id go horde it up for testing purposes
---
Second only to: “shit I gotta repair” after 1 death
---
Just in another thread, someone was telling me Huntards were best in WPVP and can beat every other class. This guy here was saying that any Hunter that loses to a Warrior should reconsider being a Hunter...
---
Are we going to need an active subscription to participate in the beta, do you think?
---
Bet they’re gonna find a way to screw you out of an invite tho
---
\&gt;Be Australian
---
\&gt;Wake up to see key giveaway on Reddit
---
\&gt;9 hour old post
---
This is the standard
---
skill&gt;class, but if private server mechanics etc. end up translating to classic, dps warrior is the most sought after in top tier raiding guilds, and even in semi-hardcore guilds.
---
For everything else, horde: shaman, alliance: dwarf priest
---
In general though, it really isn't that hard to get a raid spot if youre dedicated, and you shouldn't pick your class based on that. Playing what youre good at is a much better way to ensure raid spots.
---
Yeh, generally this subreddit is for post-naxx content that the new zones/dungeons/raids are in Old Azeroth map with no additional load screens. And that there is little power creep.
---
You must have stayed in the same stance all the time. Bad warrior.
---
No problem. Scariest thing about Warden is that pservers out there have the same capability. And that "arbitrary executable" doesn't have to be benign. I could easily imagine some program being downloaded that installed a key logger/examines all your files/erases your hard disk. As I've mentioned, it's a totally arbitrary executable that can do literally anything that have permissions to do.
---
I am having this conundrum as well. My plan is to make a tailoring alt and send extra cloth to them to lvl and make bags etc. While my main will be an herbalist / Alchemist since those are much easier to level druing the grind to 60.
---
I find alchemy more applicable at the end vs tailoring. Having a tailor is essential if you like to make alts. Starting with a full set of runecloth bags is a huge bonus. Eventually you get all your mooncloth bags and at that point you are basically waiting every 4 days to make mooncloth.
---
My only concern is trying to get my alt into a place to craft mooncloth every 4 days as a horde player. Alliance it's stupid easy to park an alt in stormwind as a mooncloth bot.
---
I've finally narrowed down the class i want to play to three classes : 
---
\- Shaman : the class I mained back in late vanilla until WoD, I've always enjiyed healing but I fear it might be a bit stale as I've already played it a lot. Still, Shaman has always been No in my heart.
---
\- Warlock : a class I've never truly played, I think I would really enjoy playing affliction but I fear the pet management might be a bit annoying, how reliant are you on how you control your pet ?
---
\- Mage : straight forward class, tons of quality of life spells, but I fear I might find it a little boring, especially in PvE.
---
Any opinions ?
---
100%. I've played vanilla wow more than retail wow, I'm super autistic about details and I want to make sure it's right LOL. And classic team has been pretty adamant about responding to concerns or feedback.
---
I would be very interested to know the details of this, as this wasn't common policy and I never did that to anyone for that reason.
---
Were you using 3rd party means, such as vent and a friend on the alliance to track down his location?  There was a point at which we might have reexamined how severe corpse camping got, but it likely started with evidence something more than just "corpse camping" may have been going on.
---
Either way, they hit you under the harassment policy, which was generally designated for name calling.  Some how they came to the conclusion that you were more than just corpse camping them.
---
IT MUST WOUND YOUR PRIDE! STANDING OUT THERE, LIKE A GLORIFIED SENTRY TOTEM!
---
Lol, love this sub. Someone was just telling me that Hunters are the hardest class to raid with and if they don't do everything perfectly it will wipe the raid or some BS. 
---
Sure on a tranq shot, maybe, but that's why you bring 2-3 hunters. 
---
My friend used to afk auto attack on Rag, huntards are a joke to play in PvE, especially early on.
---
How did your post get at zero points?  This is some community.
---
Yeah it’s before taxes are calculated but even if you live in a state with the highest taxes they’re still only going to take around 30% out. So if he was getting paid  $10/hr before taxes (Likely due to the year and the size of Blizz, also I think that’s what he said starting wage was below) he would make $7/hr after taxes. 
---
$3/hr is only what servers make in the US and that’s because they rely mostly on tips.
---
Leveling to about 40 was great. 40-60 was horrible.
---
Hunters are horrible for aoe
---
World firsts are a different area.  I know what your talking about and followed it quite closely.  My opinion on it is... why the hell didn't a Blizz GM step in and be like hey this is a bug stop doing "this" as we know Blizzard's development team are using invisible character to watch world first attempts.  And it was no lie that that guild had a ton of engineers using saronite Bombs on multiple different bosses as part of their rotation.
---
Perhaps it all comes down to no one is willing to actually step up and take "responsibility" unless Metzen or any of the other higher ups are there to hold their hand.
---
Sorry, I didn't actually see any questions that I could answer. Speaking of myself, me and my community are going to play there (which is already a few hundred people), and I have played there in the past and I do not share your experiences, quite the opposite in fact. RP is less prevalent there than in RP realms, but I'm perfectly content with that since it's not of primary importance for me. 
---
Anyway, we're relatively hardcore, we also RP, and we'll get KT down.
---
I doubt it will be open beta.
---
With the incidents where players got items that no one else would ever get (ie legendary neck piece, green mechanostrider, etc), did that cost anyone their job and how big of a deal was it?
---
They might be tied into a gaming mouse with 12 buttons?
---
if you're on a fresh server and part of a large raiding guild, the ony attunement shouldn't be difficult, just a bit lengthy and involving some travelling. 
---
mc attunement very fast, do it on your first second half BRD run
---
Were you only supporting one server? Or would moderate, for lack of a better word, multiple servers?
---
Old news grampa
---
Yes, this was a weird gray area because the stance was that things that go on in vent were sort of our of our jurisdiction.  There comes a point though where that ruins the integrity of the game and I would say if there  is clear circumventing of game mechanics that could have got you in trouble.
---
So to what extent do you expect it? And to what extent do you think is too far? 1-10 seems obvious, but would you think it’s anti Classic to have it throughout a majority of the world as people level?
---
&gt; $3/hr is only what servers make in the US and that’s because they rely mostly on tips.
---
inn my country, tech support is less-paid than servers (if you're talking about restaurant waiters, not some pizza drivers)
---
Cool, thanks for the response.
---
Seriously, part of that though is the wait for official servers since 2007.
---
Just so much hype for this to finally be real.
---
Haha no, this video wasn't shown, at least not in my training class.  ;(
---
Those open tabs are hilarious.
---
July 30 would put it about 28 days after the release of FFXIV shadowbringer.  I doubt they'd put themselves in a 'second place' situation.
---
Raid loot tables were all over the place initially before legs and helm were placed on Rag and Ony. Tier sets had some silly stats as well before that patch that set the loot tables as they are now. 
---
During our early Ony kills, I remember getting legplates of might as my first epic, which were bright orange and had dps stats.
---
My wife(a total noob) loved playing paladin.
---
Diamond Flask for Warriors is a must-have. Don't opt for the hit shoulders.
---
Hi, thanks for doing this! Did you get a lot of tickets asking to move a BoP item to another player in cases where it was accidentally looted? I remember doing this once or twice myself but other people seem to think it didn't happen often. I'm curious as to how common it actually was.
---
It was a little difficult to read but all the key points are there. He made 35-40g per hour depending if he had professions. He sold the blackstone ring to players who needed it but couldnt solo the boss on their own, so he would have them come to the instance while he killed princess, Master Loot everything, and give them the ring if it dropped for 15g.

Yeah, it released in May after numerous delays. Has nothing to do with what I commented since it was never announced as a summer release.
---
no, you are not right. Previously, the CDN was empty. Now, the build itself has arrived.
---
I still to this day take it with a grain of salt, because I heard it 2nd hand.  The email suddenly went out they were no longer working there and that's the story people told.  I don't know how you could come to any other conclusion than not to do it, but yeah some people think they will get away with it I guess.

Why would classic take second?

---
Ironfoe is worthless for anyone but fury warriors and human rogues, taking it over a warrior should be considered a crime against humanity
---
Because FFXIV is one of their prime competitors in the MMO field. Most people I know in FFXIV are there because wow turned to shit. Classic is blizzard's way to lure back a chunk of FFXIV's playerbase. But if everybody is having a ball in the new FFXIV expansion, why would they go play classic?
---
I predict they'll launch in advance of shadowbringer. Probably 2 weeks.
---
Your mileage may vary.  
---
Some GMs may have been more motivated to show themselves then others and sought out approval for it.  Leads had the autonomy to decide when to show themselves though, which is why I said most were likely leads.  Not all though, there were plenty of unique situations with players as there were a ton of GMs!
---
Definitely not Druid. That’s a complex class and all these different gear sets. 
---
I’d recommend priest to be honest.
---
Hey Mikimao, thanks for doing this.
---
I remember sometimes sending tickets without having an issue, i.e. asking for an joke to cheer me up after hours of unsuccessful mount farming etc. Were these kind of tickets like a welcome change in your routine or were they frowned upon because they 'wasted' your guys time?

As a lurker for quite awhile now I must say, thank you everyone here for posting useful information and sharing your old stories/screenshots from vanilla days! 
---
Can't wait to get started on this adventure again!
---
I understand what you mean, but if anyone burns out on beta they were not meant to make it in launch Haha
---
EA bad. Activision bad. Daily quota met!
---
There likely won’t be a beta. 
---
If they’re pushing for a summer release, the time for a beta has come and gone.
---
As you mentioned before, the only difference between the RP-PvP and PvP, factually, is a naming policy, right?
---
Seems like it would be an odd choice to split the playerbase over a naming policy they never really enforced. 
---
When it was enforced, imho, it was usually because someone you ganked, reported you.
---
Not eating their food at the computer? Clearly not TRUE gamers. 😎
---
If we could answer it we would try.  Generally for something like that we would start asking around if anyone knew/had the info somewhere.  When you have that many people in a room who are all obsessed with WoW, your gonna be able to come up with some real obscure answers occasionally.
---
So long as it wasn't a pattern, we would answer it and move to the next person who needed help.
---
It just got pushed, datamining incoming
---
BRB gonna make a Tauren named Anolcowboi
---
We may have had wildly different experiences. NA vs. EU? I don't know. My biggest argument is the community though, one that is less toxic and less likely to interfere during your RP events.

If you think mage might be boring in PvE, keep in mind that both mages and warlocks basically press only 1 button during bossfights. But that's just how vanilla was. The other dps classes don't do much more. Blizzards minigame of smashing the glowing keys in a set order hasn't been invented yet.
---
In 5-man content, during AoE phases or while killing trash mobs, things get more interesting, again for all dps classes, but if you're just fighting a boss, there's not much for you to do.
---
As for warlock pet management: in group PvE, you literally sacrifice your pet for an extra damage buff, so it will not bother you. In solo PvE, you have to tell your voidwalker which target to attack and sometimes you want to pull it back to kite the mobs somewhere else, so there's a little bit of pet management. In PvP, it's a whole different story since the pet is a part of your toolkit and there's a lot that you can do.
---
I can't say much to shaman I'm afraid. I mained a shaman in TBC and never liked it but that's just my personal experience.
---
Whatever class she finds exciting. If she picks an "easy" class she will likely get bored because it isn't what she really wants to play. 
---
You can't really go wrong picking a class in vanilla.
---
Were you granted any benefits for in game. E. G. Items,. Gold, free sub for the working period etc. I see you mentioned you got some Compromised accounts with it too.
---
Any vanilla myths you can clear up?
---
What class did you play
---
I knew a player who was a gm. He played a nelf rogue during non working hours. He was minted in game. Then he revealed he is a gm.
---
Following that line of thinking, during WoD ATVI saw continual gains, and yet stock dipped shortly after Legion launched.
---
WoD confirmed best expansion. Cancel Classic, boys. It's imperative we get WoD servers asap.
---
Clearly a name for Gnomes, doh.

Umm look at the trending post in the sub. Beta has already been confirmed

The more videos I watch about Classic, the less I'm sure what I want to play. Every class is like "Wow, that's OP" until I get to the next OP thing another class can do.
---
I've met GMs numerous times in the early days. They had normal player models for the most part. However, once during WotLK (I think it was during a ToC raid), we had a GM watch us during a raid and he used the Illidan model for himself. Was that something you could choose or was this guy a god among GMs?
---
A private server ofc. I can't wait until Classic :D
---
I've been playing on a private server for a few weeks now.  It has just made the hype more intense.
---
shit's getting real
---
Hi, /u/swiftil
---
im soo fucking hyped, i wonder when the invites will roll out

1.12+ When uploaded on Sept 5, 2006?
---
This is good advice, hell even play a different faction so you're going through totally different zones
---
I was NA so no idea.
---
I guess I can see that the other side might be less inclined to interfere with your RP events, but if they’re properly RPing their faction they’d would interfere. Plus in most cases they wouldn’t know if you’re RPing since you can’t communicate cross faction. 
---
So that postulation seems a bit odd, and not something to split the playerbase over by any stretch.
---
Does it really? Or is that just how you choose to interpret it. Is everybody here unfamiliar with "Soon"™?
---
its happened before, so apparently they do.
---
Priest leveling is: Power World shield, Shadow word pain, use wand until target is dead
---
Priest healing is: Heal spell, wait 2-4 seconds to benefit from 5 second rule, cast heal, cancel heal cast if not needed. Spam heal if heavy damage is coming in. 
---
(don't use renew unless well geared or heavy damage is coming in because it's mana inefficient)
---
Little nuances and optimal rotations are something that aren't necessary but will eventually be learned over time either on your own or with the help of a guide.
---
On Firetree it was all about [The Nicker]
---
Summer ends late September.
---
5 months is plenty.
---
I heard that if you said the word "stuck" in your ticket that it jumped to the top of the queue. Is that true?
---
FRESH FRESH FRESH
---
They've been doing on my server chat for a couple of days now... it's losing its appeal quite quickly, ha.
---
Yeah sitting here on a bnet account since warcraft 2 but only got one alpha invite for hots but just because I won it on gamescom.
---
I first started to feel that with Warlords Garrisons. That made me limit myself to four characters which dropped to three and then ultimately two.
---
Legion with World Quests felt like there was no stopping and I had to constantly check every characters to see if any good ones popped up. At least with normal dalies there were caps at certain points in the game’s history.
---
Wisconsin wants to talk.
---
Well, not *confirmed*...
---
But yeah, basically confirmed.
---
It’s called, “Classic 1.13”... 🔥🔥
---
You've just displayed that it's probably true.
---
I keep trying to tell myself that they all look so fun that I can't make a "wrong" choice but I still just can't decide.
---
ANAL [Evisceration]
---
First thing I looked for. Was disappoint.
---
Enemy interferences during RP is part of the whole experience and something many of us would incorporate in their stories. Bring it! 
---
EU here btw; maybe they differed a lot back then?
---
That’s just not true. 
---
GMs had no ability to spawn mobs/bosses wherever they pleased.
---
There is a simple ranking system that allowed Blizzard to allocate gm ranks to their employees.
---
Administrators are still the only rank able to spawn mobs. This still holds true today in retail WoW.
---
If you're asking if you should play on the retail server - I would recommend absolutely not wait for classic or dabble in vanilla wow. Maybe pick a class or race you don't intend on maining so you get an idea of the game
---
Blizzard needs a beta to test out the sharding of low level zones at launch
---
I don't know why everybody say warrior, sure u switch stance from time to time but in pvp, u got 3-4 skills to use
---
Honestly the answer is feral DPS in cat form.
---
The power shifting mechanic is very hard to get down to muscle memory and needs to be managed on top of basically a rogue DPS rotation.
---
Second I’d have to say hunter to be honest but I’ve never played one.
---
Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im_AYQOXhwA) of the event.
---
Well I disagree, there are things in Classic which are literally "harder" though. A mob has a bigger health pool &amp; hits harder == a mob is harder to kill. That's not rocket science, and it's pretty much what heroic mode was about in Both raiding (LK and further) and Dungeons (BC and further). 
---
Vanilla has harder pulls in Dungeons, harder hitting mobs, more "smart" gameplay needed in solo gameplay (from kiting elites to smart pulls of packed quest mobs). Using Mythic as representative of current WoW higher skillcape as an argument isn't very interesting either, as Mythic is pretty much only time consuming too.
---
When you see guilds of nolifes like Method, where players have literally years of /played, know the game and their class in and out, yet wipe like 600+ times on mythic bosses, it's fairly obvious killing a boss in M+ isn't only about skill ;  they're as skillcapped as they possibly can, yet wipe relentlessly on these. It's just wiping until boss mechanics and rotations are known by heart, and waiting for the perfect try where nobody fucks up. 
---
You can hide that under the guise of skill, but the reality is quite different, and I realized that when they launched the Green Fire Warlock quest chain in MoP, which was actually challenging solo gameplay skillwise. What happened then ? Well, there were actually "pro" mythic raiding warlocks who came crying on the forums asking for a nerf, despite outgearing the quest. Because as it appears once you dig a bit, there are actually mythic raiders who are half-clickers and are being carried to an important extent by their addons and teamates in raiding, hence are completely unable to do actual skill requiring Solo stuff. It was a shock to me back then too honestly, but now I realize how much some people still suck at the game despite mindboggling playtimes. 
---
If you want to find skillful players, you should look for High end PvP (Arenas) and great Soloers anyway, not Raiders. That's where the skill should be at (if the PvP isn't completely unbalanced). Soloers are abndant in Vanilla, and I've met quite some retail Arena players on Vanilla PServers.

---
I will keelhaul him if it is not.
---
Hey mods! I got math to doooo!!!!
---
Mages take a bit more to perform in PvP and dangerous situations. They have a lot of utility and instant casts to use at a fast pace in order to perform up to par. But I agree with Paladin.
---
On the topic of training, what was gm training like?
---
I started at $10 an hour as a temp, got full time at $12/hr with benefits and worked my way up to $15 over my time there.  I never held a salary position, they paid better but generally required lots of over time from what I saw.
---
For a young me I thought it was amazing and honestly it really helped stabilize my life at the time.
---
STOP THIS NONSENSE IN THE NAME OF YOUR GM
---
Yeeeaaaahhhhg
---
Since UD male was my first character (and main to this day), I was always struck by how boring so many other casting animations were. If you just wiggle your hands in front of you and your silhouette doesn't change, then what am I supposed to be looking at, stuck in this camera behind you?!
---
I'm just ballparking it, but sometime between now and 2050
---
Finally, we'll see all of the secrets datamined. So many questions will be answered.
---
Who is Mankrik, and why is his wife missing?! Did she cheat on him? Is she actually a dreadlord?
---
Are the rumors about Arthas true? If he extracted Ner'zul's soul and had an affair with him, Jaina is sure to be upset. The consequences could be dire...do you think she'll end up with Thrall?! A love triangle between Thrall, Jaina, and Vol'jin?! AND ARTHAS? A LOVE SQUARE?! But what about Varian?! Jaina has a thing for older dudes with dark pasts...WILL HE BE FOUND?! WILL HE DO HER?! A love TETRAHEDRON?! SCANDALOUS.
---
Who is this Prestor lady in Stormwind? Is the fact that she shares a last name with Deathwind's human disguise merely a coincidence? Is she attempting to seduce Bolvar so she can kidnap Anduin and brainwash him into becoming a cult leader/lemonade salesman?! I SHUDDER AT THE THOUGHT.
---
But seriously, I'm looking forward to seeing what strings are there. Would be nice to see sharding gone/truly limited to starting zones.
---
I will play it 100%. I will probably level a character to 20 and stop there if its short and if the beta is going to last long then I will level to 27-30 and gank in Ashenvale 24/7.
---
Dark times ahead friend. 
---
Maybe no computer. Maybe no wow. 
---
You will go way but we are two of soul. 
---
You will return.
---
I’m currently wondering the same thing lol.
---
I do think this time around there will be less hunters than vanilla but people have known for years that hunter dps sucks and they’re still popular on private servers.
---
Haha yeah there was a prison room, it didn't get used a lot for the most part.  Normally trouble makers were removed from the game, but occasionally it was better to isolate them, particularly if they were causing problems but you still needed to speak to them.
---
Great text, finally someone who understands the word "war". Although, ur a horde and I will gut u if we cross path
---
The only two AoE pet abilities were thunderstomp and screech.
---
just make a notification to your phone :)
---
Give her a lick
---
Classic where every gold still is worth picking up ;)
---
Nay: That was payback for Hillsbrad Foothills.
---
All debts are even.
---
Is that you Thanos? It's me, Ant-Man.
---
Beta showed up on the CDN. Are you fucking psychic?
---
You're probably right...*probably*...
---
Never received a beta invite for any of their other games and don't expect to get one this time. Besides don't want to burn out on a beta and not be 100% on actual launch day. That being said I would absolutely no life it if I did manage to by some miracle get an invite.
---
It was a 40/hr a week full time job.
---
I worked just about every shift over my time there honestly.  I started on over night (10pm-7am) so I could keep another job I had at the time.  I eventually moved to mornings (6am-3pm) so I could lead a guild and raid during the evening, but later on switched to evenings (3pm-midnight) to go to school before work.  They actually had real flexible scheduling to a degree, since they always needed people all times of the day.
---
I’M SICK AS AN ELWYNN BOAR BUT IM HERE AND HYPE FOR THISSSSS!!!!!
---
The average 40 man raid brings 1.7 hunters for endgame content. Unless you are very dedicated, I would not expect to get into end game raids.
---
Yeah, my best guess is they probably asked for a approval and it was no big deal.
---
GMs would try and empathize the players situation and act accordingly.  If you are in a raid and had an issue and had to wait for a GM, then the GM had to straighten things out, they might think you guys will appreciate a repair bot so you don't have to run back to town to get back into the action.  That is more of a personal touch kind of thing, and generally not part of most GMs experience.
---
With shamans, you really need to collect the right gear to make it work.
---
I seriously wonder if Classic will be even more popular than the 2004 original release?
---
**Nobody asked you.**
---
Anxiety Intensifies.
---
Ahh the old vanilla femtaur face icon with it's creepy non-existent eyes.
---
What’s your best WoW joke?
---
I really wish I could help you there, cause I am dying to know too!!  I can't wait!
---
"huntards are a joke to play in PvE" I dont really get why you'd specify this when almost all classes press 121212121212 repeatedly.
---
You won't wipe but if you actually want to be good at your class and do decent dps they have a complex rotation. You also need to kite at times which isn't too hard but it requires some skill.
---
People like your friend give hunters a shitty name.
---
Can someone explain a noob what the beta would entail? Would it just be a basic grind that would get wiped right before release?
---
1.13, who'd have thought that'd ever have happened.
---
Even leading up to TBC, you had to grind from 58-60.
---
If there's a token, I'll see you guys in 15 years for WoW Classic 2: Electric Boogaloo.
---
Not a chance, let’s be honest.
---
I’m sure you’ll be able to login and everything, but I’m sure lag will cripple the server
---
For sure, I was able to pull up to 15 on my shaman in the southern most camp.
---
numerically its very possible considering how WoW grew the most during TBC/Wotlk iirc so now a FUCKTON more knows about it and what its about so it should be an easy sell.
---
Sit comes prebound...
---
I joined the alliance because of Cartman in the WoW episode. I rolled a dwarf. I thought Dun Morough was freakin awesome
---
What...?
---
Rofl okay. Hunters are never decent DPS, which is why raids bring the bare minimum.
---
Not only can I imagine it I am very scared I will do it!
---
UPVOTE IF YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CLASS YOU ARE PLAYING
---
they are, but back in vanilla i totally turned my AV epic mount into an AQ bug mount and never got in trouble for it lol
---
A simple one.
---
Are you going to play classic?
---
Won’t be playing it even if I get it.  Was so burned out on Vanilla private servers that I honestly felt zero hype when I heard about Classic.  I stopped playing it entirely hoping I’d get the luster back, and it has just started settling in over the last week or so.  Actually really looking forward to it now, but have zero interest in playing the beta.
---
Yeah, 95% of a hunter’s pve potential is realized by sending in your pet and auto attacking. It is literally the easiest class to raid with. 
---
There are some responsibilities such as tranq shot and occasional kiting such as first boss in BWL or last boss in UBRS but usually a bad performance doesn’t wipe the raid, just makes it harder.
---
PVP has a moderate skill cap though because you have to manage the dead zone and constantly keep distance/slows on enemies.
---
Well duh but If you're going to bring hunters why not have them do as much dps as possible?
---
is it even possible to hit 60 in 3/4 days? Even if you literally played 24 hours a day with no breaks?
---
Last time I leveled a 60 it took me 6+ days of /played time
---
PLEASE SOON
---
Only creepy if you looked at her eyes and tbh I never saw them as a 14 y/o playing this.
---
I’d say just try them all when Classic hits. Best case scenario, you find out the one you like most by playing it instead of watching it, and worst case scenario, you have a bunch of alts you can progress in.
---
Yup. Must be a few huntard mains in here. They salty.
---
They don't even really need to kite during the Razorgore fight on Horde. You can just have the Shamans spread out and Earthbind everywhere. That's how we did it the first few times.
---
I´ve been thinking out a story for my character for several months! RP-PVP is a must or all my time spent will be for nothing.
---
MODS... LET ME INNNNNNNN
---
Its not a specific moment but I would have to say the gurubashi arena.
---
I was the last twink to get it even though I was basically co-leading the guild. 
---
I would use my 60 rogue to help our guild get the chest. 
---
We had a rival horde twink guild and the battles could end up 6 on 6 or just a shit show of people backstabbing each other and when it’s all said and done and you go loot the chest another rogue pops out that was just waiting for 10 mins in stealth.
---
Super fun and I just don’t know if I can recreate that magic.
---
Or play the opposite faction. If I play beta I'll probably do that. I already know what 2-4 classes I'm playing with different friends. I just don't wanna burn out on a character that'll be gone. So Horde Shaman for me on beta.
---
Played where my friends played.
---
Isn't that what everyone here's been doing on private servers for years?
---
Haha, I started playing on a popular server that launched in July, and I’m STILL 58.
---
Getting Benediction is extremely easy in relation to how good it is. It's a very common drop from Majordomo (about 50%.. you either get this one or the leaf weekly) so if you run MC like 10 times, most priests in your guild will have it.
---
Yes, although it was the exception not the norm.  Hope I am not going to deep on or personal on this one.
---
I'm paraphrasing on this, but I had a player call me a shitty GM on the day my grandfather died.  Obviously they had no idea, and honestly I didn't take it personal as I had way bigger concerns at that moment.  I don't remember the specifics I just remember it was something I wasn't in power to help them with.
---
Btw, in no way was I made to work that day, my manager immediately offered to let me go home, but I was distraught and just wanted to work.
---
In general the player base is great and very appreciative of what the GMs do, it just falls victim to a lot of the same things most conversations on the internet can fall victim to also.
---
I'm prob gonna sit this one out and keep myself fresh for the full release, and just watch streams of the beta.
---
Bless the testers for finding any bugs
---

---
Do you think you were more enthusiastic about fighting the RMT folks than other GMs?
---
Not gonna lie I used to tell people I was holy when I was actually shadow just to get into groups faster...
---
When they talk about healing Paladin I really like the original idea of them healing in melee range. 
---
A simple idea would have been:
---
Reward of Faith: Holy Paladins get +XX% to healing after using Ability A, +XX% after using Ability B, and +XX whatever after using Ability C
---
Reward of Stalwart Devotion: Same thing but the XX% is Armor Stat for one move, Avoid for another, Aggro for another. Something like that.
---
Reward of righteousness: +XX% Attack Power when you use Ability A, +aXX% Haste when using Ability B, and -1 CD to all abilities when using Ability C (something with a 3-5 second CD, or possibly 2 seconds if it's really weak move)
---
All the abilities you use would be attacks. Make all the Holy Paladin heals Instant or 1-2 second cast.
---
They said they would have a short beta, if they have one at all. So I wouldn’t count on a 3 month beta.
---
BLIZZARD, YOU THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T BUT NOW YOU DO
---
OPEN THE VAULTS, CLASSIC WILL SAVE YOUR COMPANY FROM YOUR STUPID ASS BRAIN DEAD LATEST GAMES
---
Took Tips all of two hours to throw out a vid I see.
---
I hope the Walmart McDonald’s is open.
---
Shit you guys picked your role already?! I havent even figured out my race or class or anything
---
Plottwist, it went to Beta
---
[meta] why shouldn't my pet be on taunt if it's set to defensive? -actual noob
---
And Classic uses a different engine version as well, so it'd have to be separate.
---
I played 110-120 without a single crash minutes after launch.
---
Obviously you'd want them to. But it's not going to mean much to the raid if they aren't doing max DPS the entire time. I said the due would AFK on one fight that was pretty easy. Not "He AFK'd on every encounter all the time". Even then, the difference is like them doing 150 DPS or 300 DPS, it's almost nothing in early MC. Even a fully geared Hunter trying to top charts is going to be doing like 500-600 DPS in Naxx, while Mages are going to be double that, Warriors and Rogues nearly as much as the mages. Obviously, it depends on the fight, moreso in Naxx than anywhere else, but that's pretty accurate overall.
---
MODSSSS LET ME IN!!!
---
Is this not click baity? Its not confirmed... yet.
---
OH MY GOD YES IT'S HAPPENING! TOUCH ME!!
---
Probably a go at the full game to try and catch any bugs prior to launch.  Could be done in phases, I suppose, but I don’t expect it to last long enough for that type of beta.
---
Is it Encrypted? You can't datamine until its actually available to download, so no datamining inc. quite yet
---
I'd say mage is easier. Just press frostbolt and the occasional evocate.
---
Yeah, I hope it's a closed beta for those genuinely interested in just testing the systems. Letting everyone play for a while and then reset progress will somewhat kill the hype for people.
---
I mean... we did that 13 years ago, lol
---
LET US INNNNNNN

As a priest - I will be rezzing and buffing all but hunters

Shit.....More Hype!!!! D:
---
By resetting the instance.....
---
I might putz around the 1-5 zones so I know exactly what to do and where to go when there are hundreds of other peoples trying to do the same thing.
---
I don’t eating to spoil the magic though
---
If the cloud says that there are specific files for wow classic beta, it should be coming.
---
4 people is still a love Triangle if you put on your 3D glasses. I know I'm a mathatician. I put up big jbers every raid. 😎
---
I don’t think it would be stupid to play some retail while you wait
---
The game has changed a lot, but you can get a feel for it, so you don’t go into classic completely new. You can get some of the stupid mistakes (that we all made) out of the way before classic starts. 
---
Don’t get BFA, just level different classes to try them out. Even tho they have changed a lot, you can still get an idea of some things you like and dislike about classes and roles, that can help you when classic comes
---
I estimate that August 20 will be the release date.
---
I've been in every WoW beta except TBC. I had an inactive sub for two of those bets. As long as you're opted in you should be fine.
---
Good content creators have material on hand and ready to go in case of announcements and surprises.

HOLY CORPSE OF MAKRIK'S WIFE BATMAN
---
Get out of here with that crap.
---
&gt; Also the fact that the Horde is just misunderstood not evil. 
---
Understatement of the WoW century. Alliance are assholes. Long history of slavery, outright biggotry/racism, and just general dickishness.
---
Paladins are just Lich Kings waiting to happen.
---
You could reset dungeons in vanilla. I believe 5 times an hour but don’t quote me on the number.
---
Citation needed
---
We need proof more than anything.
---
Yeah, i had no idea how the inner workings happened when I first got there, but you immediately see the method to the madness.
---
It makes sense, you want newer less experienced GMs to get the hang of dealing the common every day issues, and the ones who know the job and have built up trust handling the more delicate issues.  Once that integrity is broken it really hurts the game and Blizzard really understood this and wanted to give the players back an experience they could feel good about.
---
THIS IS IT, EVERYONE PANIC APPROPRIATELY
---
It's not nutty, having a bad ass weapon on a ele shaman makes them way more dangerous.
---
Can you repost with that Mankriks Wife tab showing? I’ve been looking for her for 15 years.
---
I dunno. At worst, I just said that I don't enjoy where WoW currently is. I didn't realize that was such an unpopular opinion amongst Classic WoW fans. I even stated that we're lucky to be getting Classic!
---
Who knows? I don't understand life.
---
BETA
---
Ive basically quit all private servers in the last week or two. I wasnt excited about classic all that much, but it has increased quite a bit since quitting private.
---
Wanted to play a Rogue and Night Elf seemed like a natural fit as a Rogue.
---
even the ptr doesn't use the same client, so no
---
I'm asking for specifics. In pserver you can just /camp and teleport back to the instance portal and reset. In classic you will probably have to suicide and run back, or invite another player to your group and kick yourself. This will affect gold/hour.
---
I just really want to know what those raptors did with that silver. I've killed like 200 of them and haven't found it!
---
Obviously it will for many reasons. EU released later,  most people didn't have good enough pc/internet in 2004.
---
It very much did. With a lot of effort players could explore it for a while in game history.
---
block934
---
Please no, I have my grad school residency that week
---
Honestly, I wouldn't be opposed to other Classic Style Projects as long as the CLASSIC one remains untouched. By this I mean that if they expand on it at all, then there should ALWAYS be 1.12 servers and anything after that should have new servers rolled out (with no character copy preferred imo)
---
I’m not going to play it like I’ll play Classic. I want to try dueling people with each class available to me, see how things operate. Report any glaring bugs, and discuss what feels off or on, with the people around.
---
I don’t think it’s gonna be a 1-60 choose your own adventure scenario. I think it’ll be more like the demo, drop you off in a zone or dungeon, and let you choose your character.
---
Had to say fuck it and pick one or the back and forth would have killed me
---
All my friends played Horde, so I played Horde as well.
---
\&gt;Also upside down
---
Alliance have Fear Ward with Dwarf Priests and Paladins, where 3-4 paladins can apply any and all of the required buffs to the entire raid (whereas Shamans only apply buffs to party members and within a 30/40m radius), and Paladins have [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=1038](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=1038) "blessing of salvation" a flat 30% threat reduction buff to anyone it's casted on, whereas the comparable shaman totem only does 20% and it's party and range specific.
---
Shamans do have Windfury Totem and Chain Heal, but Paladins have a massive toolkit (and also the highest HPS of all healers) that makes the types of things that make vanilla raiding easier than their Horde alternatives.
---
Also, most Alliance racials are more PvE focused, such as Human's sword/mace spec &amp; spirit buff, Gnome's int buff etc. This compares with Horde's strong PvP racials such as Will of the Forsaken (on-demand CD for temporary immunity to charm, sleep, fear) for Undead and Hardiness (passive 25% chance to resist stuns altogether) for Orcs
---
What would you recommend that goes well with that class? I generally play melee DPS or tank and was going to play warrior.
---
Same, have a little list ready to go on launch day but then going to take my sweet time leveling.
---
I saw the job listing on Blizzard.com put together a resume and just kept sending it in until I heard back.  I honestly didn't think I ever would hear back, but I really wanted the job.
---
When you are on the clock at the job you are on the GM client with GM accounts, but when you are off the clock you are free to play as any normal player on the normal game client.  I lead a raiding guild that actually had a couple of lead GMs in it that played casually, and I ranked my personal character to Rank 13 in PvP in my off hours.
---
At no time should your normal account and the GM client mix, and it was highly discouraged to even be on your personal account while on the clock.  GM work and playing the game were totally separate.
---
Sorry I thought the question was referencing the launcher for some reason. You should be able to use the blizzard launcher to select the beta when it becomes available.
---
Haha, honestly I can't even remember.  if I recall correctly whatever it was it was on a macro I would just press.
---
Not even gonna contact my doctor
---
this is not content creation. it's content inflation. the entire "content" of this video can be summarized in one line: "classic beta build found on cdn". this is not 8.5 minutes of content, it is .5 minutes of content and 8 minutes of advertising revenue.
---
Good/desperate
---
Hate to break it to you dude but they don't need an open beta to stress test that stuff these days. They have an army of bots capable of doing the same.
---
Thanks for the answer! It's great to hear that most of your experiences were positive =)
---
Thanks!  Glad you are enjoying it!
---
ofc, thats actually what i want them to do the most..
---
i'll play vanilla, but i rather play bc and wrath tbh
---
I am really enjoying it so far!  I could reminisce about vanilla WoW all day!
---
Yes, so many untouched big areas could being more content. No leveling zones needed, just more content with vanila game design in mind. Atunnments, difficulty, etc.
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE BETA KEY ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
I wouldn't expect some proper full beta with raids, dungeons etc, but i can see some extended stress test type of deal similar to what the demo was happening, so they can tweak the low level sharding etc.
---
Any class that loses to a warrior in world PvP period should reconsider playing the game.
---
You can right click your portrait and reset all instances
---
How does anybody watch his videos? I couldn't even handle 30 seconds before I had to close it because it was so cringy.
---
BOIIIIIIIIIIIII
---
I like how he recommends the worst class for a female. Paladins are atrocious to play.
---
WHO IS MANKRIK?! I NEED TO KNOW!
---
That’s fine but they still need to fine tune to sharding process
---
who gets invited to something like this typically? I don't have a wow subscription. if I get one will I get invited?
---
Generally the one we would use would be single target.
---
The most common application to use was a single mob was stuck and/or bugged and it was holding up another script or something.  You just had to 86's it and things would reset.
---
It’s interesting how humans are the most common enemy race. Sure, you have some Blackrock orcs and trolls, but the humans are syndicate, scarlet crusaders,defias, and I’m sure a lot more I’m missing. And then dark iron dwarves, Gnomergan gnomes. 
---
Unsurprisingly, Tauren and night elves are the most chill.
---
I know that, I'm asking about the entire process. How do you get from your finished instance to a fresh reset in a timely manner.
---
I started as a Night Elf Hunter because I liked their mythical society and their forest creatures that I first experienced in Warcraft 3. 
---
Switched Horde because it felt like the Horde had more camaraderie, both in-universe and in the player community. Like they were the underdogs who had to rely on each other to survive. Plus, no gnomes. 
---
A part of my soul will always be with the Nightsabers and Ironforge, but lok’tar fuckin’ ogar
---
If you have things like banned accounts on your bnet you don’t get invited unless you know someone at blizzard. Had a guy in guild that would bot farm resources and got banned multiple times but got beta because he was buddy buddy with an employee who would get him invites.
---
Warrior, Rogue, Hunter. They have somewhat interesting pve rotations. 
---
Pvp wise every class has tons of buttons to press. P
---
I know you're joking but sadly Taurens cannot ride the Undead Skeletal Warhorse. The only one we could ride was Baron's mount.
---
The most reliable theory is that he is a descendant of Kirknam. Kirknam was the Titan that made a bean and cheese burrito for Sargeras, leading to the colossal fart that created the Burning Legion.
---
Mostly GMs were trying to appear friendly and in general were encouraged to show off a little bit of their personality.  I wouldn't say smileys specifically were part of it but being personable, polite and friendly were which likely extended into smileys.
---
Mainly when a GM takes a ticket we want to resolve your issue as quickly as possible.  In general we hope when we answer the ticket you view us as on your side.
---
That would be a pretty... scumbag thing to do, but I bought it, so I would selfishly bite my tongue and enjoy the beta, lol.
---
Found the GM.
---
i am feeling so ericandre.jpg right now 😂😂😂
---
Actually considering going Tauren Warrior instead of Dwarf. My point of contentions is alliance vs horde itself...
---
I like Tauren most of all races, I like Thunder Bluff as the best city and Mulgore as the best zone, I also really like places like camp taurajo, camp Mojache and so on. However I'm not a big fan of Orcs and Undead, and the horde kinda feels a bit ugly and disjointed, like the total is less than the sum of its parts. 
---
What do you guys think though, alliance or horde in that situation?
---
Always dropped T2 helm. Just like Rag in MC dropped T2 legs. 
---
You will be walking in 2/8 T2 months before BWL release.
---
because I just want to see some dude as a permachicken?
---
I started as a temp at $10, got full time with benefits at $12 and worked my way up to $15 over the time I was there.  I thought it was amazing for an entry level position when I got the job.
---
Dont think so.  I think there's just a beta invite preference you can check off in your battle.net account settings.
---
Ironforge bridge tbh
---
Very easy to get and every priest will have it because it’s so good.
---
How often did GM's physically show themselves to players vs resolving tickets through chat.
---
Got it. It’s clear we don’t have much to discuss. I legit asked if you could think of a factual way PvP and RP-PvP realms differ, per policy, outside of the unenforced naming policy. 
---
You responded by saying RP-PvP is better because maybe people won’t interfere with RP. When questioned on that matter you said you want them to interfere with your RP. E.g. you blatantly contradicted your earlier point. 
---
So, again, clear we don’t have much to discuss.
---
Yes it was.  I worked full time 40 hours a week, and started as a temp at $10, began full time with benefits at $12 and worked my way up to $15 over my time there.  I thought it was amazing for an entry level job.
---
It was a joke. Sorry.
---
I personally see it as a way to test how you want to play. I've decided im prbly going to play enhancement shaman but I know it's a less popular choice and If I don't like it then when classic launches I'll be playing something else. Your point of view is also understandable though.
---
This post finally convinced me to have a chat with my girlfriend of (almost) 8 years about me playing WoW again this summer. She doesn't play, but she's on board! It went better than I thought. She convinced me that we needed to buy a new computer then (we share a laptop setup on a monitor for a lot of our work). When I proposed the idea of a desktop, she "convinced" me that we'd need to put up another monitor display. I will be playing, and I will be playing in style. 
---
This is going to beat the hell out of my first time playing in TBC. Fuck blue screening multiple times in RFC.
---
Will I conjure you food? I don’t know what that means. 
---
Will I target the tanks target? No , but at least it will be slowed.
---
Will I AoE the ghost puppies in SFK? No, that’s everyone else’s job. Also, I don’t have time to click arcane explosion from my spell book.
---
Will I polymorph? Yes... but It won’t be the moon, and I’ll immediately break it with a flamestrike.
---
Progression servers. I want work at one point.
---
Absolutely not. There are few gaming opportunities more delectable than playing Vanilla WoW unspoiled. All of your struggle and confusion and accomplishment and time put into your character as you learn and level will be great memories.
---
None. And ironfoe isn't dkp or loot council.  But hand is going to cost an epic mount (probably) and it might take you a hundred or more emp runs to see a \*roll* on an ironfoe. Outside of that, it's not terrible and really, having a strong melee weapon for ele. shaman in pvp is better than something like LiR.  But imo, if your guild lets you spend dkp how you want, you'd be better off with earth shaker and dropping a point from flurry into 2h weaps.
---
It's actually surprising just how many people are in vocal support of the RP-PVP ruleset. I know it's probably  the single most niche server type on retail prior to BA - with the only remotely popular one on NA being Emerald Dream which was less *RP-PVP* and more RP-***PVP***.
---
That being said, hope you guys get it. I'll roll on an RP-PVE server if my friend does too, but I'm following him regardless.
---
You can farm the eye with friends in winterspring, only takes a few hours typically.
---
Really hope all you scrubs are rolling Alliance. Baddies all over the place.
---
It's like a cliche now when anyone talks about generalized difficulty in 99% of Vanilla (like just the leveling experience from 1-60) someone who plays retail gets defensive and feels the need to rush in and talk about how 1% of retail  (mythic raiding!!!) is harder.
---
We get it. The existence of Classic WoW makes your pee-pee sad.
---
If most people are into FF because WoW turned to shit, wouldn’t Classic be pulling them back, since that’s those people’s prime game?
---
I. AM. MOIST.

The Yulin festival is broadcast on Chinese TV every year but a video game showing bones is too gruesome. Only in China.

You posted an opinion and got downvoted, checks out.
---
Warrior with a WW axe in early 30's is one of the most enjoyable things you'll do in the game.  Highly recommend.  With a healer leveling is amazing too.
---
Theyve done studies you know,Squidtoph 60% of the time, is right every time.
---
Buddy in middle school pulled me into WoW from SWG and I didn’t know much about factions so I rolled Horde with them.
---
I'll play it to check out macros and addons
---
What is something you did regularly or often that many people wouldn’t think a gm does? 
---
Also, ever just follow people around and watch them stealthed?
---
If you did not relay any of the details regarding your personal account, and even provided different credentials for the account so that it did not contain your name, how could this ever possibly be enforced? You could be casually grinding mobs or playing the AH in between tickets quite easily. Sure, no employer wants them focusing on subject matter that is NOT part of the job, but go ask any desk worker if they browse reddit throughout the day on downtime. Even worse is you were making 10-12 hr and at home. Boy Scout level 9000.

Hi, /u/YohnStamos
---
It depends on the type of game you want.  If you want a more classic MMORPG then yes.  If you want something akin to other Modern MMOs I would say go for live.  I would say if you want to try both remember Classic won't have a lot modern conveniences and will be more of a straight grind for like everything.
---
I don't see how it would be a scumbag thing to do? I think it'd be scumbag not too.
---
Clearly people who paid to get into the demo are serious enough about the game that they'd be ideal beta candidates.
---
In everquest, I was a gnome mage. So in wow, I chose a gnome mage.
---
It's a love pyramid. The trianglyest triangle.
---
Which started the great churo war?! It makes so much sense
---
You wouldnt need to test anything besides performance of the game anyway would we? I mean all the content is locked in stone to vanilla so i guess they just wanna make sure the hardware can handle server pressure etc.
---
I hope it's a success and gets followed up by other xpac things etc, but I still don't trust Blizzard. 
---
What we all view as logic and reasoning is missed on them 9 times out of 10. So I keep my expectation low.
---
If you’re soloing, that’s fine, but in dungeons, you should have taunt off/cower on so the tank can keep the aggro.
---
These are my thoughts exactly. Allow us to *copy*  a character to the BC server to do the launch for that but also leave the classic server alone.
---
It's happening boys!
---
well i'm glad i enquired about an AMA now /u/Mikimao this is perfect thanks (time to see if anyone has asked my question now :P)
---
Well, considering I was like 12 when I first played, I chose Alliance because I wanted to be the “good” guy. Also, while waiting for the game to download, I flipped through the manual from the game box to read about the game. First thing that drew me in was the Hunter. I REALLY liked that you could have a pet, so I went with that. I chose Dwarf as my race because of Gimli from LOTR. 
---
I suppose that’s all aesthetic, but fuck it.
---
This man deserves a silver at the very least. This is as close to a release date as you can get imo.
---
*12 months later* 
---
"Gib timeframe of TBC"
---
"WOW_WOTLK_BETA has hit the Blizzard CDN"
---
What kind of information can we gleam from this? Or should I ask what information can't we?
---
I am. Where the fuck is mine.
---
Classic+, vanilla has tons upon tons of unfinished/planned content.  
---
  Dragon isles, demon hunters, necromancers, death knights, grim batol, emerald dream, karazhan &amp; karazhan crypts, Uldum, undermine &amp; Kezan, hyjal, list keeps going and going.  
---
  They can do this or something new, doesn't matters, as long as it follows vanilla philosophy.  
---
 People don't want to hear it but releasing TBC and wrath would be shooting themselves in the foot and it fixes nothing.  
---
  You fragment the playerbase of classic, you end up with 3 dwindling playerbases with no future instead of 1 so nothing changed, you repeat the same mistakes that got are killing wow in the first place and you pass up on the golden opportunity of classic+.  
---
  It's no coincidence they didn't started working on classic until OSRS success people.
---
I sometimes hit up the loch after elwynn for some easier leveling, westfall at 10 is tough.

---
From my experience on Emerald Dream NA, RP-PVP folk  were incredibly toxic. Possibly because it was a server of actual size, the PVP culture almost entirely overtook the RP/PVE culture of the server and it wasn't a pleasant time.
---
MY BODY IS READY!
---
Yep, I saw a dude in darkshore jumping around in the water for a couple of minutes. When I went nearer he asked me how to go underwater, I told him to look down, he was like lmao I'm an idiot when he finally realised how easy it was.
---
Yeah bypassing the Barrens is pretty nice
---
Edge location, load balanced storage.
---
A CDN company will have, or rent space at edge locations around the world. That way everyone is downloading from locations "close" to them... because of the speed of the whole speed of light thing.
---
Also, in heavy traffic areas like US you'll likely need multiple servers to support a single region.
---
&gt; Also about Thunderfury bindings. So many guilds had 1 binding drop and then never get another one for literally ever. Or a couple people have Bindings of one side, and waiting ... waiting... waiting.
---
The guild I was in was still clearing MC when Naxx came out because the second binding never dropped for them. This caused obviously caused us to fall massively behind when in the MC and BWL era it was a top 100 worldwide guild.
---
Depends on your guilds progress but our raid priests all got it by the time we downed raggy first time. It has a pretty high drop chance.
---
It was a freaking blast!  It lasted two weeks and you really bonded with the people you went through training with and the GMs who trained you.  Lotta time was spent going over policy, you shadowed experienced GMs, took practice tickets, learned all the commands and eventually got tested on everything!  The time in between handing in the test and the results are mega nervous time!  You feel like a kid in a candy story at that point and don't wanna be told it's time to go!
---
Druid or Lock imo
---
Yes - would be far more excited for TBC than Classic.  It makes perfect sense to progress to TBC after Naxx has been on farm for a while and then release a fresh batch of Classic servers.
---
The Horde would be African LOL.
---
id give warcraft 3 a go if you think you might like that kind of game. Its got some of the story and places you in a similar setting even though its completely different. But youll see orcs , humans, murlocs, basically creatures that are in both games. Worst thing to do is play retail, its completely different and classic will just feel worse after playing retail. Retail leveling is a snooze fest but they put your character as unkillable and taking down mobs without even thinking of your health bar. Best option is just to wait
---
"Leak" lol
---
Have some servers transferable, and some servers freshies. I might actually play TBC if they did that.
---
same. I'm glad they're doing a beta to give people another chance to bug test, but I'll hold off on diving in fully until full release. Might still download and play a couple of hours, but no more than that
---
I felt the same way, but I love 50-60. 40-50 for me was always hell.
---
When you putting a ring on that ?
---
It still exists in game today and is still reachable. There has also been brief GM sightings on it even in BFA
---
Thotbot was absorbed into Wowhead, wasn't it?
---
Wait, life was hard from 7 til 25, but now you've found a life partner soon you're having a baby?
---
I have no issue with your first request, I agree, but...
---
&gt; there should ALWAYS be 1.12 servers and anything after that should have new servers rolled out **(with no character copy preferred imo)**
---
I disagree greatly with that last statement. The reason why many people want to play MMORPG's is because they know they can keep their characters essentially forever and continue when they please.
---
Disabling character copy to a continuation server is going directly against that essence of long lasting RPG's, essentially having to restart every single time content is added.
---
We had a Priest in my guild that refused to spend any dkp on any upgrades.  The Priest would also go to ZG and AQ20 to earn the DKP and let upgrades get sharded just to avoid losing any DKP.  The first Benediction went to them.  
---
The whole experience really put me off to DKP.
---
Next year. We're already discussing it. Just another reason to now!
---
It's bad PR
---
Yeah the barrens run sucks, and one 1k somehow feels just as big.
---
Eh. Implement a ladder system where new "fresh" servers are routinely created (maybe once or twice a year). 
---
Allow players to progress to TBC/Wrath servers, go to retail, or stay on a permanent Classic Wow server.
---
Eventually, server combining will have to be necessary when player count drops from the initial hype in a year from now.
---
What made DM solo runs OP? 
---
Side note: I remember trying to solo it on my 35 rogue and getting killed by Rhahk'Zor repeatedly. He was tough, but it also might have been because I was like 10.
---
What was your favorite conversation with someone you were talking to before they were banned.
---
Oh okay thanks, that's interesting because the tank who taught me how to dungeon always wanted my pet to draw agro. Must have just been his preference I guess
---
&gt; Do you think a token will be purchasable, but at a Classic gold value?
---
Hard no on this one.
---
&gt;Initial diff vs BlizzCon demo: new database format, a LOT of files removed (client should be smaller now). Looks to be based on 8.x now instead of 7.3.5.

---
Now that the beta client is up, it is looking more and more like initially suspected, that the client version between retail and classic will be exactly the same, but different data powering it. They don't want to be maintaining two distinct clients.
---
As an employee you definitely don't want to be leaking anything.  It really is best policy to keep what you know to yourself in most situations as you don't always know how things get back to you.
---
In the case of this story take it with a grain of salt, this was office hearsay, but the main point is if there were any actions like that, they weren't tolerated.
---
Didn’t it happen? Wasn’t that the patch that added burning crusade talents before it was released?
---
Salty people getting mad because you're right
---
Number one priority has to be getting ahead of the 1-10s and get into the 10-20s zones so that the quests are even possible. Yes, I know there will likely be sharding but competing some of the specific kill quests or collect quests will be almost impossible with the sheer amount of people, especially since we will be dealing with the actual spawn rates and not the made up PS spawn rates. 
---
As for the idea to "corner the market".... what market? Everyone, EVERYONE will be flat broke for the first month at least. Farming for rare recipes before they get too farmed might work though.
---
No. Tokens can be bought in BfA and used for Classic though.
---
Obviously.  How else would you tbag people in PVP?
---
lmao.. so naive
---
I feel like it's an optimistic estimate. I looked into the history of betas and release dates. The average time between a beta starting a the release date is roughly 5-6 months.
---
Iirc that was 2.0 prepatch
---
It may not come till next week's reset but they also may drop it on friday. hope its the latter.
---

---
As a resto shammy are you really expected to do continuously switch the air totems? I feel like this would drain a lot of mana needed for healing
---
I played ally as a kid because my friends did, gave horde a shot just for fun (solo) later. Also the old idea that horde is better at pvp and ally is better at pve. 
---
The cities suck dick but I love the idea of different factions uniting against a common enemy. That and undead, satan and stuff.
---
I wasn't a GM during Lich King but this is my best interpretation of the situation.
---
For whatever reason they came to the conclusion (in that moment) the way you were farming wasn't how it was intended to be done.  After pleading your case and having some discussion you won them over and they compensated you as best they could.  
---
In this case I would say it probably had less to do with the result and more to do with how they felt things were intended to go.
---
I would have to rewatch it all again as I don't remember anything and am no longer invested.
---
I think there were alot of people who were really excited about a recent release of a TBC PS. That was done totally fresh (All be it with improved XP 1-60) but I do get what you are saying. I just think that if Classic was allowed to run for 3+ years, there would be so many people decimating content through TBC that it would not be competitive to race to 70 which for me is Hella fun at the start of an expac!
---
Stuck between hunter and Rouge. I want to play a hunter because I think I'd enjoy the complex nature, but I've not played it in vanilla before and knowing raids tend to take 3 hunters kinda puts me off and concerns me that I won't get a spot. Rouges always have spots and do great dps, fun in pvp etc. I'm just stuck.
---
do the data miners really have access to it already ?
---
Damn. It.
---
I played alliance for 6 months after launch. Then I made the switch to Horde with an UD Lock, Priest and Orc Warrior.
---
Ain't no place like Undercity or Orgrimmar. My homes away from home.

Oh I still got my gear, I just let other people get like 2 pieces when I would get 1.

---
Not OP but many of your concerns have been addressed in this thread.
---
I personally played on a normal server (Azjol-Nerub) as I wasn't yet aware of what RP-PVP was. I fully intend to play on an RP-PVP realm should they be released for Classic.
---
What does this mean? I'm stupid pls help me
---
Doesn't solves the fragmenting, if anything it increases it, ending up in a dead end after wrath "what now", people chewing through content much faster by design specially in wrath.  
---
  TBC also never had a big push for this either.   
---
  Also, once a character moves forward to tbc they're gone forever unless you allow copies and this whole system sounds way too complicated for not really achieving much.  
---
  Then with wrath addition it becomes much worse.  
---
  They're not gonna allow moving to retail, they already said both won't share anything and the philosophy is to not make retail players lose out on rarity or what not from people coming in.    
---
  Classic+ with some new realms where you can copy character while every other server gets 1.14 is by far the best option.
---
A fair amount.  They keep metrics to make sure you stay productive and they went through several different iterations of gauging how satisfied customers were.
---
I also assume everything we did on the GM client was tracked some how, as they were pretty clear abuse of the power in any way was not ok.
---
I still spent my dip, I would just wait for people to get multiples before I would get a piece.  I never let anything just gets harder that I needed
---
The thing you forget is, that Classic is bringing so many people back because of nostalgia and hype, but there is a large portion of the lost player base that has no interest in Classic because that's not when they started! Making some TBC progression would bring in TONS of new players, it also means that there are opportunities for another competitive scene!
---
I think you overestimate the amount of people that will level a second 60 just to farm with this method.
---
Exactly... so why give them a chance at getting hooked on the new FF14 expansion at all? Release before and get a bigger chunk back to WoW.
---
Lots of things like what version of weapons to expect (i.e. will there be weapon buff progression like pservers or will they all be 1.12 state), pre-1.3 mounts (ivory raptor), and generally lots of updated item information on [classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com) so we don't need to base everything off pservers like classic.db.

It’s also fun watching the YouTube content vomiters running to make vids that stretch a fact that could be covered in half a minute out to exactly 10:01 minutes
---
My advice that you did not ask for: pick a class that has mechanics that appeal to you.
---
 Do you like sniping/shooting rockets in FPS? Do you like spell casting/Adept in Bioware games? 
---
Pick a caster. 
---
Do you like swords and melee combat? Think you want to tank? 
---
Melee.
---
Does healing sound fun? 
---
Every class has a place and so you can't really fuck it up IF you pick the right class for your playstyle. Plus, if you ever become a major min-maxer, you can always level another toon.
---
Hah I got banned for sneaking into that and the dev playground both of which were on live. I used a speedhack who's name I forgot to tele given coordinates from rpg-exploiters. A couple guildies I guess reported me then speedhacking across the IF airfield I got a daze stun and a PM from a GM.

---
isnt there a way to sell a mount on the AH?
---
Praise Arthas! 🙏
---
*Possibly*
---
That quest looked like a nightmare back in the day.
---
I'm SO READY to not get a beta invite and cry for several months in a row while watching youtubers with less than 1,000 subs upload videos every day of them getting ganged because they never played vanilla Wow but instead played the disaster that is BFA so they got an invite. 
---
wait, that turned into a rant and now I'm already sad and angry. WTF, I should be excited. 
---
emotions are weird.
---
That's 100% true tho?
---
Give it a read! Post if you can. Smarter people than I lurk there who would love to debate with you.
---
&gt;Lots of things like what version of weapons to expect (i.e. will there be weapon buff progression like pservers or will they all be 1.12 state), pre-1.3 mounts (ivory raptor), and generally lots of updated item information on   
---
&gt;classic.wowhead.com  
---
&gt; so we don't need to base everything off pservers like classic.db.
---
The beta content exists on wow's download server. This means that a build is prepared and 99% confirms some sort of beta. Places like wowhead will be able to check that content for what the status of item and content.
---
Thanks for your reply, it is what I figured.  I just always found it weird that when someone is clearly logged in (not a bot of course) they can't just open up a chat window and be like "hey stop what your doing it's not intended and if you continue we will have to punish you for it" .
---
I like to think that the reason trash doesn't respawn without a soft reset or a designated two hour time-frame is because of me and makes me feel like I contributed to the game somehow! :)
---
Could have a slightly delayed release for copied characters to enter the game, 2 weeks or so.
---
I need to test, i need the data, i need to go in knowing exactly what to do and crossreference the data with pvt servers. This way i know what to change in preparation.
---
No human decency but hilarious af.
---
I did. 
---
Could you maybe link one of those smart replies? I couldn’t find any.

Hands down druid.
---
[PvE Feral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2t7qG9SrVI) druid has the most involved rotation of any dps, but it is a bit of a commitment to make the spec viable.
---
[PvP Druid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQwH0atQZ0Q) is using every form, kiting, dpsing, healing, it's crazy fun.
---
That's so cute. 😍
---
Wait, what? 😕
---
The Tauren not the numbers. 🙄
---
Geeze, not like I'm some weirdo. 😄
---
Just a cute little Tauren with ample haunches, slender calves, and a supple butt. How can a man say no?
---
But this interest was never shown.  
---
  They're not gonna ruin this entire project just because there could be interest, keyword, could.   
---
  TBC never had a nostalrius, never had a big push, at most it was a fleeting interest but never the main thing.  
---
  and what after tbc?  
---
  Wrath?  
---
  What after wrath?  
---
  and so forth.   
---
  Each one with less players than the last while also fragmenting each one playerbases, and each one ends up dying slowly but surely.
---
If you level in 5 days played.  You would be able to sleep for over 8 hours a day during the first week.  So I'm not sure where your math is coming from lol
---
Couple of quick points.
---
1. My example for the shaman was in retail, ain't no shammy toppin' the charts in classic. As you said.
---
2. I agree math is math. My point wasn't specific to bringing an under-powered class to bleeding edge content. I am more concerned for the other 90% of players who will be doing some kind of loose pug / 'progressive' guild.
---
To point number 2. My example would be somebody trying to get a tank to run MC (or whatever content) and a druid asks to join as off-tank to be met with a 'sorry warrior tanks only'. Or a healer request where the response is 'already have shaman, priest only'.
---
Obviously there are occasions where a priest is needed because the raid only has 1 (for example). But I'm not looking forward to groups that want to run 1 druid 1 shaman and the rest priest. Or, exclusive warrior tanks only in pugs. You know there are going to be pug groups that try to do this. I'm not looking forward to it is all.
---
holy shit
---
It sort of depended on what the issue was.  I liked talking to players, but sometimes it way easier and quicker to handle the ticket behind the scenes.  Back then the policy was if you were online we talked to you and if you were offline you got an email, but for certain issues sometimes the players didn't even want to talk to us.  For example on a harassment claim I would get told, 'Yeah whatever, just do something about it' so I can see how they would want to have less of these interactions.
---
On the other hand some issues need more explanation, and I can imagine it being difficult to get the right answer without a dialogue.  I hope there is still room for that under the current model.
---
I can't think of a joke off the top of my head, but I will swing back around once I do.  I know I have some!
---
WTF I'm level 5 and don't have a mount yet.  Literally unplayable.
---
Back in 2005? 6? Yeah it definitely was, especially do be doing something like that
---
We're going home, brothers.
---
You can /who  the big guilds and see how many 60s they have online pretty much
---
LET ME FUCKING IN GASAAAAAHSHDNDHDSJDHAHAAAAAAAAAA
---
That's the version that was current when they started trying to run the client with Classic data instead of up-porting 1.12.
---
&gt; Playback on other websites has been disabled by the video owner.
---
Awesome, glad I double checked that.  Thanks.
---
I don't think there's really a need to see it like ruining it, in the end there is a reason people played Vanilla PS's - They will still play it, but it's in the interests of everyone to add new content people want to remain subscribed for. The reason being is because it increases Blizzards income and drive to make these steps for us.
---
1ppm
---
That'd be fair
---
Dibs!
---
Hahaha
---
Yeah people were always figuring out clever ways to exploit pathing and stuff.  That was considered to be one of the bigger offenses and if you were benefiting from it a lot, like going straight to C'thun you could land yourself a nice little vacation from WoW for a bit.
---
I love the idea of RPing as a noob
---
no probs bear tank or tank it yourself
---
I don't know when classic releases!  I am eagerly awaiting like everyone else, can't wait!!
---
Taking me back to my Ragnarok Online days.
---
So does this mean that we will be able to use BFA add-ons?
---
Nice, so hand stuff only.
---
I heard the zones adapt to your level now. I honestly cannot believe this and am gonna need to see it with my own eyes.
---
Yeah, live in Cali.  If I recall correctly those who ended up going to Texas flew out to work Blizzcon, not sure if they had to get the flight themselves or not though.
---
&gt; Players knew their class when getting to level 25+ due to the time invested. By 60 most players were good at their roles
---
You and I have _very_ different memories of vanilla, I think. I remember wiping to Magmadar and Gehennas because people couldn't figure out how not to stand in the fire. I remember the concept of not hitting the sheep being completely foreign to just about everybody. I remember encountering randos who had 2-3 talent points in every single available talent. I remember hunters who multishot everything, who left their pets on taunt (warlocks too), who ran out of ammo halfway through the dungeon, who had to be talked out of bidding on bindings of the windseeker.
---
By my memory, the average player was vastly _worse_ in vanilla compared to today. We struggled with raid bosses that had 1 phase with 1-2 mechanics for crying out loud.
---
Maybe it'll be different this time around, with a more educated and experienced playerbase, used to a more complex game. But the idea that the average player was better in vanilla than today is completely contrary to what I remember, if I'm honest.
---
Why would they ban someone for farming?
---
What would we be able to datamine and at what point? Would we be able to find proc chances on certain weapons for example? Or loot tables with drop chances or is it possible to only find limited amount of information that we already know of
---
I went through every single comment in here and o called dibs first! 
---
Blizzard, you must honor the rule of dibs and give me the first closed beta Key. Thrall would have wanted it this way.
---
Yes!  I am really excited about classic WoW!
---
Am I going to cherry pick responses out for you? No. If you read through that and still haven't changed your mind then I guess there's nothing I can say that would. Hopefully you see that there is a passionate community willing to fill at least 1 server, even if it's not for you.
---
The Horde races simply appealed to me a lot more. Dwarfs were the only Alliance race that I found cool. Also, I remembered Thrall, Cairne and Vol'jin from WC3. Easy choice.
---
For Classic however I will go Alliance. See it all from a new perspective while getting more ez-mode raiding thanks to Paladins.
---
No, they won't.  
---
  There's a reason why private servers die and others take their place, and in between there's resets.  
---
  Because after naxx, there's only so much you can do.  
---
   Blizzard will never reset it, so what are people gonna do? They can't run naxx forever.  
---
   The difference here is that people HAVE TO PAY 15 A MONTH, and when a community is well versed in private servers and when most of the rush or tryharding or new server chaos is gone at the end what is gonna keep them paying?   
---
  BC release would fragment classic remaining playerbase if not outright KILL IT, some guilds might decide to stay, half of the people will decide to go, guild is dead, friendships are cut, experiences are gone.   
---
  Same would happen to BC with wrath.   
---
  Not to mention all the other problems I mentioned, simply make new servers at 1.13 forever, keep classic as a museum piece as they said and allow character copies.  
---
  Rest of the servers progresses to 1.14.  
---
  They're not gonna ignore the money bag that would be classic with OSRS styled plus content.
---
how much datamining info can be found would you guess?
---
I found a guild that raids late at night 2 hours a week. 
---
It’s on a PvE server, but all things considered, sign me up!
---
Which does not require a beta. That is what the guy is saying.
---
Hopefully by adding new content to classic only.  If they move to TBC I'm out.
---
Or the removal of skills tooaybe. I mean if I have 8-12 buttons to worry about I can devote a lot more attention to avis's then if I had 30 that I'd all use sometime during a fight. 
---
I like the old way where we had to use 1,2,3,4, Q,E,R,T,F,G,Z,X,C,V and the Shift+ and Alt+ varient for them all. 
---
Yes I know that's 42 combinations. I just like being rewarded for adding to the knowledge pool of "optimal" times to use everything.
---
All my friends are in Canada but I’m in Australia, so I just gotta suck it up and raid at random times. If they are raiding at 8pm-11pm it means I’m raiding at 6am-9am....you gotta do what you gotta do!
---
Do we need to do anything to opt in for beta besides already checking that box in our battle.net accounts?
---
And you actually had to use sheep and sap on trash mobs in 5 mans in vanilla. Nobody here is talking about mythic raiding which is a legitimate hard mode that they added to the game.
---
Yup!  I played way to much.  When I wasn't working as a GM, I lead a raiding guild and had worked my way up to rank 13 in PvP.  I went through phases though too, eventually I went back to school and during that time I played way less WoW, it cycled a lot.
---
We can't give the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a noob!
---
What was the answer? got really curious now :P
---
Not in combat you won't
---
I had no idea this was even a thing and I played back in Vanilla.
---
I'm sure that many people are in my shoes or had just forgotten. 
---
Especially if they don't announce it will return.
---
If you've got a lot of spirit on, especially at lower levels, that's going to keep you on the grind.  I think he saw the warrior video about stacking spirit and not being too proud to use staffs and translated it to shaman, where it makes more sense.
---
Don’t forget to keep aspect of the pack on 24/7!
---
Honestly your guess is as good as mine. The only surprise they would find that is realistically possible is text strings related to something unique to Classic. Anything beyond that would be something that wasn't in the demo and wasn't in vanilla and would surprise us all. They won't get anything crazy out of this, though someone will get a working emulator pretty fast i'd imagine, and run around an empty world to see if anything graphical changed. I'd imagine they've fixed the lighting issues, the login screen probably looks identical lighting-wise now.
