On runescape you can scam by putting in items, accepting, and removing an item and re-accept in the same tick and people don't see it leave the trade window and accept the second screen(if they don't doublecheck). Still possible to do too.

maybe I am misreading this post

Experienced players &amp; Pserver players who already knows and done all the raids will be re-forming in Classic. I am in one of them, I can stay with them and be in EZ mode doing all the raids. I left during AQ opening, but they already cleared all contents. So during classic - most of our members knows what they need to do.
---
I am hoping to find, new players who never done MC/Ony/BWL/ZG/AQ, etc. Even though I know most of them, I wont be sharing them my knowledge. But these players will also have the same hardcore drive to clear these dungeons w/o the help of an experienced player leading them or watching guides/videos. 
---
I would like to find these players. Finding a dedicated guild who are seeking NEW PLAYERS who too wants to do hardcore raiding and experienced the entire struggle, yet progressing more than the casual guilds
---
Yup. Xrealm sucked the fun out of PvP completely. Much rather sit through 30 min wait times again than have instant queues that weren't even fun.
---
I don't think Blizzard cares what your argument is, or is at all interested in arguing with their playerbase. They are explaining their design choices, and then the playerbase is arguing with itself.
---
You want to auction anything of the following suffixes:
---
___ of the Bear (STR/STA)
---
___ of the Monkey (AGI/STA)
---
___ of the Owl (INT/SPI)
---
___ of the Eagle (INT/STA)
---
These are the most sought-after bonuses. You can usually disenchant the other stuff. The only greens worth vendoring might be weapons, if you want quick cash.
---
Yeah 15 bucks a month

Battlegroups were present by patch 1.12. They are a vanilla thing.
---
Not gonna happen like that. 
---
They expect the classic launch to be huge. 
---
Which is why they’ve implemented sharding. 
---
They also (rightfully) expect people to get bored and quit. 
---
See, if they decide on day 1 to open more servers then what happens if 90% of the initial player base decides they don’t actually want to play classic and quit? Suddenly those servers only have 10% of their original populations. 
---
I expect any new servers to come after the initial hype has died down
---
I got rank 13 playing about 8 hours a day for 3 months in vanilla, so your numbers are way off.
---
That reminds me that Raise Ally used to turn you into a ghoul lmao
---
How is it? Maybe I'll start sucking around on a tbc server depending how tilting league gets after a few games

Yeah, this rogue knows his job.

It's an addicting grind unlike anything I've ever played before.
---
You people don't realize how hard is to get  **High Warlord/Warlord RANK,** it takes month and months of PVP, not only that you have to play 24/7 to achieve it becouse of the PVP RANK decay which is very harsh.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I played retail WoW Classic, and only 3 people on my server achieved **High Warlord, and maybe 6 or 8 people achieved Warlord rank.**
---
All of them shared the accounts, so always there was someone PvPing...
---
I don’t think CoR/FF stack right? They’re like sunder/EA - the more powerful one overrides the other.
---
No. Listen, I'll try to explain it from yet another angle:
---
All items in Classic will begin with the stats that they ended up having in 1.12.
---
Items that did not exist at the beginning of vanilla will not be there at the beginning of Classic, either. They will be made available in the phase that corresponds to the patch in which they were originally added.
---
This can mean one of three things, and they haven't said which:
---
1) Both the level 58 (1.4) and level 60 (1.11) versions of the blue PvP set will be available from the start. This seems silly.
---
2) Only the 1.4 version will be available from the start, which makes it worthless when all other gear in the game has 1.12 sets.
---
3) The 1.11 set will be available from the start, even though they've just said that items are not added until the patch that originally introduced them.
---
The way they've explained it, the answer is #2.
---
The new blue PvP sets were added in patch 1.11. According to Blizzard, this means that it will be added to Classic in Phase 6 which corresponds to patch 1.11. If they're made available from the start, that's an exception to the aforementioned rule of adding new items only in the patch that originally added them. They have not mentioned any such exception.
---
The upgrades to the epic PvP sets do not consist of new items but rather changes to the existing items. Therefore these items will have their final, upgraded stats in Phase 2 (patch 1.4) when they first become available.
---
[This item,](http://classicdb.ch/?item=22267) for instance, did not exist until patch 1.10 so Blizzard will add it in the Phase that corresponds to patch 1.10.
---
[This item](http://classicdb.ch/?item=22868) did not exist until patch 1.11. However, "in reality" it should have been the upgraded version of an item that existed since patch 1.4, but due to a totally arbitrary quirk in the way they chose to upgrade the PvP sets, the item is not an upgrade of its 1.4 counterpart but a new item altogether.
---
I can try to use an analogy instead if you like:
---
In 1990, Steve borrowed 5 Deutsche Mark from Bob. Twenty years later, the D-Mark was replaced with the Euro. Does Steve now owe Bob an amount of Euros equivalent to 5 D-mark, or does he have to literally pay Bob 5 D-Mark in now-defunct currency that has no value?
---
perhaps they lost the very second they thought increasing their performance by 30-40% even means anything in vanilla raids.
---
you could tell them to not bother if they dont want to and just show up in greens and still crush molten core!

&gt;RP PVP servers are the best wow experience.
---
&gt;I'm sad that they won't have an RP PVP server at launch. Because very few people are likely to spin up a new toon once they decide to open one.
---
Why wouldn't people spin up a new toon for "the best wow experience"? If they were to launch with only PvE servers and then opened a PvP server six months down the road, launch day of that PvP server would be like Christmas morning for me.
---
&gt;Give a rifleman an old musket or someone who's never shot a gun before a newer rifle. The experienced person is more likely to succeed than the noobie.
---
So you're saying the guy playing 16 hours a day is more experienced and therefore better? Sure some people will always suck, but there is usually some sort of correlation between how good you are at something and how much time you've put into it.
---
Anyways, this is going off track. You asked why someone would bother being an "vanilla elitist" and I gave my 2 cents as someone who has been on both sides of the spectrum.
---
Why would you mail whites to alts? You mean if you are leveling one and the item fits?
---
That was definitely in the 90s. I think I had just started highschool.
---
Sure you can, I agree that it's perfectly possible in theory. My point is just that Casual will correlate with bad compared to hardcore, because hardcore raid guilds usually have built in elitist approaches to recruitment while casual guilds do not.
---
You can absolutely have a casual guild with an elitist approach to recruitment, but they will be a minority of the casual guilds.
---
\&gt; Casual implies lower time commitment not lower accountability or lack of tough leadership 
---
Casual definitely correlates to lower accountability and quality of leadership. That doesn't mean one absolutely must cause the other though, but the correlation is still there, and people who want to have a good casual raid experience should be aware of that so they know what to look out for.
---
Longer videos = more ads = more money. They do this to stuff videos full of fluff. Very few classic youtubers dont do this but the ones that dont are amazing.

---
The ganking happens, and I've had a handful of times when corpse camping was a problem. But, it was usually enjoyable. It was nice to get attacked randomly (yeti cave N of southshore) then come back and get into a nice fight. Before long their are Allies grouping with you and it's a great mini battle. Then it calms down and you keep questing. It really gave a real world feel, it heightened feelings of ill will towards the horde for me.
---
I remember the broken (akama) in warcarft 3. I don't recall anything about draenei till wow tbc.
---
I love how the PvErs have an aneurysm if a couple pvp blues that take hundreds of hours to get are better than some T1 gear, but the fact that complete bis PvP gear is 100% from Naxx on some classes is completely ok.
---
My parents picked me up but never put me down again.
---
Bolvar
---
Yeah, it’s been awhile since I’ve played it, but The Broken were definitely featured in Illidan’s TFT campaign.
---
I'm agreeing with you because I'm hoping that's true.
---
Ion's latest post about not immediately releasing an RP-PVP server because they want to try and control server population/sparity leaves me hopeful that cross realm bg's may not be required.
---
The entire reason they were brought in was due to server population imbalances and lack of population on servers
---
Raid bosses are just walking around wondering what their purpose in life is.
---
No, I mean whites as in trade goods. I would send all tailoring trade goods to 1 alt, leather to another, and so on. So if i wanted to help a guild member get bags for example, I could just jump on that alt and trade them the cloth they needed. I would save everything but greys. Just resubbed my account after years, I still have vanilla trinkets, and random collectibles that are now useless. I saved it all, because it can sell, trade, or come in handy eventually.
---
Where are you testing it? Just curious because I'd like to test some ideas out too
---
Where has this been specified? The itemization post today?  
---
It's not the modification of an item or it's stats during the course of the game, it's simply gating the "new" armored mounts until the phase they were originally added in and removing the old school ones.
---
Worst thing I did easily could have got me banned.
---
I made an alt with the name slightly misspelled from one of the servers biggest raiding guilds main raiders. I then sent an in game mail to the guilds guild bank character asking for something like 5 lava cores I think it was. About a day later the person who manages the guild bank thought I was legit, and sent the mats. I mailed those to my lvl 20 undead rogue, and then stealthed my way to the bottom of the church in SW city, and messaged trade chat saying first 5 people to get to me each gets a core. 
---
While the latter part was fun, the former part is fraud and I assume was/is banable. I truly didn't expect it to work, and kinda freaked out when I got the items. I could have sent them back, but I decided to give them away instead. I wanted to be sure the items were not in my hands in case a GM ever got involved, I can say I clearly didn't profit off my fraud.

AYAYA Clap
---
Where you going from 30-38? I plan on hitting desolace but can't remember the lvls there
---
This time around, just take my time and make sure I'm having fun. In vanilla I raced with my friends (leveling, gearing up etc), and I didn't take any time to soak it all up. I just want to stand back now and then and just absorb it all, read quests properly, follow the lore.. I basically want to sit back and relax this time around. That's pretty much it.
---
I mean the point remains that being a dedicated boomkin that farms consumables and is always there to raid will be taken over a half assed rogue with a tendency to flame anyone who implies he's not the hottest shit ever to grace God's earth.
---
The bottom line, for me at least, is that hybrid players should always have a healing set, but that good raid leaders will give them the opportunity to DPS on the appropriate encounters, when there's a surplus of healers online, or when content is on farm. The mentality that hybrid dps is not viable in raids is just as stupid as hybrid players refusing to heal (or offtank, in the case of bear druid).
---
Completely blind. Classic does a good job of giving you skills slowly, so you learn to use them properly. If I could wipe my mind and start from scratch again I'd do it.
---
Playing games blind during your first playthrough is the best way to experience the wonder and excitement they hold. 
---
Look things up in order to avoid being scammed or cheated by other players, and once you're 60 ;)

The old mounts are in the "Alpha" people datamined a few weeks ago, they didnt say anything about it yet.

No need to add anything to the game to figure this shit out, smh.

Vanilla wow was best wow
---
The mythical Blue Post is once again upon us.
---
&gt; Because very few people are likely to spin up a new toon once they decide to open one.
---
So by that logic all RP-PvP realms were dead in vanilla, because the game didn't launch with RP-PvP. People could and did reroll on them when they finally opened up in Patch 1.8, which was nearly a year after release. Furthermore, character transfers didn't start up until half-way through 2006, which was 8 months after RP-PvP realms opened up. So it's not like players just transferred across. 
---
I completely understand why people want RP-PvP servers; I played RP back in the day and am planning PvP this time around, so RP-PvP is appealing to me. But Blizzard have no idea how popular Classic will be, and neither does anyone here. Private server data is pointless because private servers are free, nor do surveys mean much because it doesn't cost anything to click on a survey. It's an entirely different matter for people to cough up dough every month to play a 15 year old game, and whilst I hope Classic will be wildly successful, Blizzard is playing things conservatively and that makes perfect sense.
---
They also can’t be stopped in most cases. They may not have a strike or be able to slow you, but they are going to be unceasingly running at you. They’re also exceptional at being damaging dispellers and healers. A ret paladin that knows he can toss freedom on the rogue and stun the healer is invaluable in PvP.
---
This.  My one friend is going to be playing for the first time ever, and I just keep telling him how jealous I am of him because he gets to play a 15 year old game, that is arguably one of the best games ever, for the first time on fresh, legit servers.
---
From what I've been reading and concluded it said " items will be as they were in 1.12 before tbc patch" so the mounts where items to...
---
Yeah smash meellee was the best smash.
---
Also your ability to read, evidently.

My **(me)** 60 rogue was crit with an Overpower **(from an enemy warrior)** for 2500 by someone **(the warrior using overpower)** with BRE **(the weapon used by the warrior who used overpower to crit me for 2500.)**

No that's Warstomp. Thunderclap is a Warrior ability.
---
Viable... how? Competitive with pure frost/arcane and fire/arcane (depending on raid tier) in raiding? No. Viable as a dungeon/pvp spec? Sure.
---
My response to riotisfuckinggarbage.
---
The best actually. Alachia's podcast on the Meta really inspired me as a kid. (Episode 13 of WoWCast)
---
&gt;If they released Molten Core with items having their original values, pretty much all caster and healing loot wouldn't have +healing or +damage.
---
So casters should get disproportionately screwed over for the sake of "purity" when clearing trivial content from the very beginning of the game? Not a great look for class balance if you're going to make Mages and Warlocks utterly suck for MONTHS.
---
&gt;Tanks wouldn't be able to reach defense cap. 
---
The ZG patch NERFED the defence on gear by 33%, making getting +def capped harder and not easier. Of course I'm sure a vanilla WoW #NOCHANGES purist like yourself knows this right?
---
&gt; I don't see how making the game easier is good.
---
Molten Core is easy regardless, it'd be easy with progressive itemization, it'd be easy with 8 debuff slots. 
---
&gt;I don't see why getting half your BiS gear until AQ40 from dungeons is good.
---
Utterly ridiculous hyperbole like this hurts your argument. 
---
&gt;I don't see why it's good that the fastest speedruns will be decided by whoever has the most rank 14s and not by whoever has the best coordination and skill combined.
---
The honor system isn't getting implemented until Phase 2, and will have no BGs at all. BGs are implemented in Phase 3 with the release of BWL, so you're unlikely to see a single Rank 14 until a month or two into this. By the time a single guild has a noticeable number of Rank 14s to speak of AQ will be just round the corner anyway. Besides, speedclears are determined by stacking world buffs more than anything else, and this will actually be NERFED compared to private servers due to Blizzard accurately implementing the server cooldown on buffs like Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer. Making them harder to plan your raid around.
---
&gt;I don't see why it's good for the game that we won't be seeing a bunch of exciting changes when each phase drops in regards to gear.
---
Yes you will. You'll see exciting new gear from Dire Maul and World Bosses in Phase 2. You'll see exciting new gear in BWL in Phase 3. You'll see exciting new gear in ZG in Phase 4. Exciting new dungeon loot, crafted items, and AQ gear in Phase 5 and so on.
---
Also how is it "more exciting" with progressive itemization? You log in when a new phase hits and the gear you had rotting in your bank for months is now better. How EXCITING!
---
&gt;I don't see why it's good for the game that epic items won't feel epic.
---
Utter ridiculous hyperbole that hurts your argument. Also there are plenty of epic items in MC/BWL that will be garbage regardless of progressive itemization or not.
---
&gt;I don't see why it's good for the game that by adding this change, there's less incentive to run raids due to most gear being obsolete.
---
Utter ridiculous hyperbole that hurts your argument. Even MC will be run constantly until the end of Classic for Bindings, BRE's, Onslaught Girdles, Strikers Mark, and all the other amazing epics that are hard if not impossible to replace. 
---
&gt;I don't see why it's good for the game that this change will make dungeons become obsolete forever once Pre-BiS set has been obtained.
---
Utterly ridiculous hyperbole that hurts your argument. Dungeon loot is overhauled in Phase 5 just like it was in 1.10, changing BiS lists significantly. And no matter what people are going to obtain their Pre-BIS lists and run fewer dungeons, but they'll still run Dire Maul Tribue runs, they'll still farm Librams, they'll still want resist gear, they'll still want to gear up alts, they'll still want to get materials for ZG head/leg enchants, they'll still want to farm Strat for Righteous Orbs, they'll still want to run Scholo to make flasks, they'll still want to farm for those rare recipes etc etc etc
---
Classic launch is huge. 
---
Doesn’t include RP PvP servers. 
---
What.jpg
---
I played vanilla going in blind. I didn't even know you had to pay a subscription after you paid for the game itself LOL. Probably the most fun I've had with a video game in my life.
---
I really wish Blizzard would make minor balance and itemisation tweaks to the Classic game to make this the definitive version of Vanilla WoW.
---
A few things I could think of:
---
* Give Paladins Crusader Strike as a baseline level 1 ability (Same properties as it was in TBC otherwise.) First of all, this is what the devs originally intended to do with the spec. Secondly, the problem with Retribution is that the spec does shit DPS until you get tier 2.5+ gear and then it gets to mid table levels, and even then good luck getting said gear when Arms warriors outclass them in almost every way. At least this would buff their DPS and make them more competitive with Fury. This would also help prot with maintaining single target threat and be a more minor buff for spell damage shockadins.
---
* Change Redoubt and Reckoning to proc on being hit. The devs changed this in the 2.0 prepatch because making tank talents proc when you become the victim of a critical strike is dumbfuck game design.  It’s also a critical reason why Prot Paladins never did more than tank dungeons in Vanilla. The entire point of tank itemisation is to stack enough Defense so that you become uncrittable, because if you take 200% damage from a raid boss, you’re probably gonna wipe the raid. The issue is that by doing this as a properly itemised prot pally, you will not benefit from these talents at all.
---
* Do something about the badly itemised tier sets.. Because nothing’s going to typecast a class into a single spec/role more than their tier sets only having stats suitable for one spec. Even if it means having multiple versions of the same tier set for each role, or using some of that modern WoW tech to make stats dynamically change based on your talent choices.
---
* Nerf Preparation to not reset Blind’s cooldown. This was a necessary nerf that was done in the TBC prepatch because skilled rogues were capable of exploiting Blind in particular to achieve absurdly long stunlocks in PvP to very slowly zero-to-death much more geared targets over a matter of minutes.  This would be an example of nerfing an overpowered and also un-fun PvP tactic.
---
Nah, it was always in the game but it was a crappy 2.8 speed 2h that was no good to anybody. In 1.10 they changed the speed to 3.8 making it compete with Arcanite reaper as a pvp wep(while being much less work to obtain). They did the same thing with both the epic 2h swords from Baron and General Drakkisath. Before 1.10 they had like 2.5-2.8 swing speed
---
It's unfortunate the links don't work now, it was still extremely useful information.
---
This is not necessarily true.
---
First of all, if you stay amongst the top honor earners every week, getting R13 takes ~2 months and 14 takes ~3. This is the minimum possible time. If you're always in the top bracket, it will take you the minimum possible time. If you sometimes slip a bit and fall down a bracket, add a month to the whole process.
---
Secondly, the PvP environment has changed since retail vanilla days. People don't just PvP for 18 hours a day and earn as much honor as humanly possible. The PvP community decides on an amount of honor that an adult can realistically make in a week, and that becomes the unofficial cap. If you don't adhere to this, you will be shunned from the premade community and unable to progress.
---
This means that you can stay in the top playing about 50 hours a week. It's still a lot, but it's doable while working full-time or attending college, as long as you don't have many other obligations than work and WoW. It has become a lot more reasonable because the people who play vanilla WoW today are adults who shaped the system to accomodate them.
---
Back in the day, it did indeed take like 18h/day to stay in the top bracket because you had to earn as much honor as whomever was earning the most, meaning any nolifer on the server could massively inflate the amount of hours it took to compete. That shouldn't happen in Classic, at least not on the servers with a serious PvP scene.
---
You can literally take days off nowadays while grinding for R13/14. You put in 8-12 hours a day. It's still not healthy by any means, but you don't have to sit in front of the screen from the moment you wake up until the moment you pass out from exhaustion. Things have changed.
---
If they don't want to do progression itemization they should buff the previous bosses in MC, etc to account for gear being in their better state thus indirectly nerfing that content. The bosses should be buffed to try and "recreate" the original difficulty you would have without the buffed gear.
---
Yeah the items don’t change. They’re removed. They’re adding items in certain phases so there’s no reason for them to not save the new mounts until then. 
---
The whole logic was changing stats on items being a PITA.
---
I know, what a waste of work, and the information is still useful/interesting even if the items aren't going to change.
---
I'd surprised if they don't work them in somehow. It's purely aesthetic with nothing to do with gameplay, and it is a nice 'legit non private server' feature they can claim and a nice nostalgic nod.
---
The issue for many is finding the perfect raid times. There is no guarantee the right type of guild with compatible times will be on your server.
---
You can spin up new (non-metal) servers pretty much immediately nowadays. That didn't exist 15 years ago.
---
Well, mounts are items but old mounts are completely different items from the new mounts, it's not like they kept the same name like weapons/armors but with different stats.
---
Old mounts are in the game in the 1.12 patch, they didnt completely disappear like old stats, I hope they make them available for a period of time, it would no sense if they didnt.
---
Yeah it was but that’s what I was jamming out to during vanilla.  Who am I kidding that’s what I still listen to
---
The point is that everybody and their mother play the viable classes, especially rogues and warriors. It’ll never be a flat out dedicated moonkin vs. Subpar Rogue. Since there’ll be 10 rogues waiting in line to take his spot. It’s been shown on private servers the problem isn’t finding decent players, since the average player is much more dedicated than back then and the % of people raiding is higher, due to raid times/days being less as well.
---
Viability st this point is relative. Otherwise 40 man raids are viable with only 20 people. That doesn’t mean people want to put up with that. The 400 dps Ret paladin is by definition also viable, but when a warrior can do 1k+ dps, it’s in some people’s minds not viable, since they want fast clear times and someone doing below 50% DPS of the best, while also not contributing in anything else, since you already got blessings from healers.
---
400 dps paladins are viable if you think of viability being if you can clear the content or not. The difference is that, for a lot of people, the game isn’t about if you can clear the content or not. It’s about how fast you can do it, within the internal rules the guilds set.
---
Phases aren't corresponding to 1.x patches.  They're corresponding to when they add dungeons, raids, and PVP.
---
210% blind. I remember the childlike wonder of making my dwarf Hunter and using raptor strike with my basic axe then "upgrading" to a Tomahawk, a white weapon from the vendor with higher attack speed. I thought it was better for that reason. It was a complete downgrade. Lol.
---
OK yeah just wanted to know if it worked at all
---
To be fair, it can be very interesting to see/hear someones first impressions as well as the thought process following these impressions. The problem isnt really about the style of content, but rather a lack of skills to adequately pull it off. These content creators dont have original thoughts.
---
All these year later I'm still butt-hurt that alliance get Shadowmeld AND Paladins.
---
fact: this is an indirect nerf to all endgame content.  everything will now be 2-3 steps down in difficulty.
---
It's a pvp spec. It's nice in premades where the extra burst of fireblast and blastwave is worth the tradeoff of losing ice barrier in a world with lots of dispels and heals.  
---
  
---
If you're playing mage to pve and are expecting cool fire/frost synergy and rotations you're out of luck.
---
guess this answers the question of how many allies does it take to kill a horde... buncha fuckin pussies..
---
This is the only acceptable answer.
---
If you dont like the comment, dont read it
---
I'd assume so. No reason to expect otherwise. The fact it's so juicy early in the game means i think we'll be seeing a lot more arena farms this time round
---
They clearly don't believe that the game will support a RP-PVP server after the hype has died down. 
---
Could it support a RP-PVP server at launch? Sure sounds like it. But they obviously think that after launch dies down and the people who weren't going to stick around left, the server population would not be large enough any longer.
---
As you know there were no RP-PVP servers upon original game launch either.
---
If they were lazy they wouldn't be releasing gear at the points they were released at originally. It is not fun for a player to have to google every piece of gear they get just to make sure it doesn't get buffed and become bis or worth using. Will it affect content difficulty sure but so does everyone knowing ever strat to every boss and dungeon. Classic will not be able to completely recreate every feeling ever from back in the day.
---
I fantasize about this possibility daily.  If they break my heart and move to TBC, I might quit all video games for good.
---
Actually your point reminded me of a bunch of people saying in the TBC-LK days 40 man Vanilla raids were tuned for 25 players and 15 slackers lol.
---
Are we supposed to just wait around and hope that blizzard maybe launces a rp-pvp server? That doesn't make sense. 
---
Also how are blizzard gonna decide there is need for a rp-pvp server of there isn't one to join in the first place?
---
As much as I want this game to be a true to form recreation of my childhood WOW experience, I can't find much fault in this post's logic.
---
Most quests involve killing mobs. You generally don't have to kill mobs just for the sake of levelling up (others will tell you otherwise, I've never once found that to be the case in Vanilla WoW however). In general three ways to level are:
---
1. Questing
---
2.  Doing Dungeons
---
3. Grinding
---
A combination of 1 and 3 is most efficient, but in my opinion 1 and 2 are the most fun. You can honestly just quest for everything if you don't mind travelling around a bit. Dungeons are super fun though and if you're not trying to speed run I highly recommend them.
---
In all honesty it depends on the kind of player you are. Classic takes a lot of patience. Pulling more than 1 mob or being in the middle of a respawned mob can send you straight to a 5-10 minute graveyard run. 
---
If you play new mmo's and like leveling fast and getting to end game quick. Classic isn't for you. I suggest leveling with friends and enjoy the journey to 60. Cause it's gonna take time.
---
Wait, how can I play gw1? That game had the best pvp IMO of all time, never had as much fun as the pvp in that
---
Just how they measured the demand of a classic version after TBC launched.
---
I never did that so you clearly haven't the slightest clue what you're talking about. You've become boring so I'm cutting off the feeding tube, troll. Good day
---
Spoiler alert
---
To be totally honest with you, I have misread the date. It also didn't help that it was one of his latest tweets, which gave me the impression that it was a recent one.
---
Atleast I checked if this has been posted here before. So yeah, it's old, but I think it's still worth being discussed.
---
It was for [Thistle Tea](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7676#comments)
---
A cooking recipe that was made BoP / limited to Rogues only in patch 1.3
---
I don’t care about original launch. The RP PvP community is large and vocal and Blizzard should launch with that server. Worst case they merge it into another one if it underperforms. It won’t, people love the server type.
---
There is nothing to cut off I'm not trolling you, you're just an idiot.
---
They want to avoid merging servers because stuff like that destroys the community aspect which is one of the biggest draws of classic.
---
.. That's not what I saying, was saying there's people arguing and posting about playing on RP PVP servers and this tweet is OLD and basically says no RP PVP servers on launch.
---
MC is a joke compared to many boss fights that came after
---
They literally said that last update.
---
OP I think you're missing something.
---
&gt;No. Listen, I'll try to explain it from yet another angle:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;All items in Classic will begin with the stats that they ended up having in 1.12.  
---
&gt;Items that did not exist at the beginning of vanilla will not be there at the beginning of Classic, either. They will be made available in the phase that corresponds to the patch in which they were originally added.  
---
&gt;This can mean one of three things, and they haven't said which:  
---
&gt;Both the level 58 (1.4) and level 60 (1.11) versions of the blue PvP set will be available from the start. This seems silly.  
---
&gt;Only the 1.4 version will be available from the start, which makes it worthless when all other gear in the game has 1.12 stats.  
---
&gt;The 1.11 set will be available from the start, even though they've just said that items are not added until the patch that originally introduced them.  
---
&gt;The way they've explained it, the answer is #2.  
---
&gt;The new blue PvP sets were added in patch 1.11. According to Blizzard, this means that it will be added to Classic in Phase 6 which corresponds to patch 1.11. If they're made available from the start, that's an exception to the aforementioned rule of adding new items only in the patch that originally added them. They have not mentioned any such exception.
---
Blizzard has stated this. Conclusively:
---
&gt;That’ll change once phase 2 rolls around and we add the Honor System, which will introduce Honorable Kills, Dishonorable Kills, and **PvP Rank Rewards. The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12.** Keep in mind though, just as it did originally, it will require a substantial time investment to rank up through the Honor System. For those interested in the Rank Rewards, earning epic gear will require consistent dedication over a long period of time as a top contributor on your realm. We don’t expect to see many people running around with these items early on, but we’re certain Hillsbrad Foothills will still see its fair share of action!
---
They said that then, and reinforced it today by stating that there will also not be progressive itemization in PvP. 
---
PvP rewards will be added in Phase 2, and will use the 1.12 versions of the rewards. PvP rewards that existed prior to 1.12 will not be used.
---
Not Vanilla but TBC. 
---
At early TBC there was an area above shatrah city that was undeveloped. It could only be reached by flying mount, but it frequently had mining nodes and herbs ready to be picked with just a small trip. I profited from it, but had a lovely idea as a true PvP rogue to leave one thing and then wait for any horde to take the bait. 
---
Funny thing was that it also had no graveyard, so whoever died there would soon find out that as you spawn outside shatrah city that you have no way to reach your body and you had to ress at the spirit healer.
---
There was this one infamous chinese guild though that was like an angry beehive; kill one and two more would take its place to exact revenge and more. They were unpleasant to say the least, and I had the whole guild on a KoS list. Oh so when I killed one of them, I was happily waiting for him to realize there was no way to ress normally and to pay the troll toll. But what happened instead was a priest came to res him instead because no way he would pay for a spirit ress. Thus I killed the priest. Two corpses now. A shaman tried next. Three. Then soon after had a full group out there scouring the area with a felhunter looking for me. I sat on the neutral line, laughing as they spammed /spit at me.
---
Felt like an evil genius for weeks.
---
4.... shit
---
The Draenei in WC3 or Vanilla weren't really like the TBC Draenei, they were more like if the Broken were even more corrupted and degraded. I think they're called the Lost Ones now in retail lore.
---
Praying for Reck Bombs? XD
---
What will be done with like Silithus cultists, NPCs and their quests (similarly for Arge…
---
Right now the only real alternative that I know is wowwiki, https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonskin_Cowl saying it was 1.10 - but itemization.info was way superior
---
ranking = a thing you get for PVPing after they add it
---
tracking = a thing hunters, druids and dwarves can do
---
Also weren't the Eredar the ones who corrupted Sargeras in the original lore? Not the other way around like it is now?
---
Totally agree they nailed flying in Wrath. And to be honest they probably designed the scale of the zones with flying in mind. 
---
But, genuine question here, are you really saying the purpose of Classic (vanilla) is just to let us recapture the time period and feel the nostalgia of remembrance? I thought we all believed vanilla had objectively superior game mechanics, which were steadily ruined by changes over time? I thought we all agreed not having a dungeon finder makes the game more fun? If it's objectively better, why wouldn't you want that in the other expansions? It would be such a new and interesting experience.
---
Apparently there are lots of different people who are excited for classic, for very different reasons than I am.
---
And let's be real, most of the items that were exchanged or changed because they were terrible to begin with
---
How can you possibly think that option 2 is even a remote possibility? They're not going to create a new set of gear. They'll give us the 1.11 sets, in phase 2, which is the PvP rank rewards update. Just as the PvE items they introduce will be introduced in their final form.
---
I'm not sure what this is in reference to.
---
Except entry level raids won't be harder for everybody because they were never hard from a gear perspective, they were hard from an execution perspective. People remembering MC being hard aren't remembering themselves being undergeared because gear was shit, they're remember players standing in fire or not getting out of the raid as the bomb and that type of difficulty will be very present in Classic.
---
With the recent news about item implementations, a truly useful (and long)  YouTube video about what combination of items is now bis in a given phase would be a reasonably useful and non-low-effort video. I agree with op that a lot of these videos seem to be extremely low effort and once youve clicked one classic related video you can't seem to get rid of the suggestions for more no matter what you do
---
Sounds entirely stupid. How many players are they expecting? They know full well they could fill at least 1 RP-PVP realm per region.
---
Ok, ya got me, I'm the one being an idiot here, and it's probably clear I've got a bias towards spell batching. You make a decent OP, but I'd still prefer to have the game work how it did Vanilla-MOP, for one it's just how it worked back then, and two it never really gave me any issues personally.
---
Genuine question: is the purpose of Classic just to let us bathe in nostalgia? Or do we believe vanilla had objectively superior game mechanics and forced reliance on community? If the latter, why not push those principles forward into the other expansions?
---
Honestly I hope they don't. If you're planning a class that can Farm gold effectively, it's that much easier by your epic Mount plus all the consumes need. If you're planning a different class, gather consumable materials like herbs or mining mats, and sell them for more money than you would OG vanilla. And end up with the matching need plus more gold figuring out faster. Win-win IMHO
---
It's a game. Stop projecting.
---
Can't stand streamers or the majority of YouTubers. They put themselves on a pedestal for, well, nothing really.
---
Nostalgia got me hard. I remember barrens questing on my pathetic tauren warrior while my boyfriend at the time would be farming mats or something else for his AQ raid that night. I finally just said aloud wheres mankriks wife? And he just started laughing.
---
Ghost wolf for shaman
---
Not 20 guys, but 40 guys in greens will do it about 9 days after launch.
---
Dragon semen has a long and storied history. Don't you dare besmirch the noble art of discussing big veiny throbbing dragon dicks! HOW DARE YOU SIR
---
jesus that makes it completely useless : /
---
I appreciate your replies. What about dungeon finder? What about heirlooms? These are convenient and save time for people who aren't 14-15 years old with no responsibilities, but they have a very real impact on community and the sense of satisfaction from time invested. By your logic, if dungeon finder is okay in Wrath, then why not in Classic? Surely people have just as limited time to play the Classic as they will the inevitable Wrath re-launch. 
---
Interested to hear your thoughts. Thanks!
---
Nah. Shadowmeld is great in pvp. You can time a meld to force an interruption on fears/poly that’s being casted at you. Or heal while melded behind enemy lines. Or if rogue, you can meld into re-stealth
---
At least there's only really one class that makes use of it, and it's a bit too fast to be an ideal PvP weapon. Silver linings, y'know?
---
You could summon bosses in Silithus.
---
WoW classic is video game crack.  I tested it out on a private server and within an hour I couldn't stop playing again.  It just triggers all the right sort of risk/reward/social centers in the brain.
---
Youre only half-assing your RP if it's not also PvP. It's so immersion breaking to be a staunch soldier for the Horde and encounter an Alliance dog in the world just to ignore it.
---
What are we preserving? Is the classic project just a time-capsule? Or did vanilla have objectively superior game mechanics?
---
Fair point. We should keep flying. What do you think about removing the dungeon finder though?
---
If you’ve never played alliance, keep in mind that it offers a boat load of quests and lore that’s not available to horde.
---
Then again... loktar ogar, brother
---
So... are you gonna suggest a fucking weapon or just jerk off? I'm sure people would like to constructive information.
---
For example, some relatively newer builds seem to prefer SoR, for both pve ret builds and pvp holy reckoning. Will Nightfall do more good than Ashkandi because of the spell damage buff? Is 1h ever better because of the speed and more appropriate stats, like Lok'amir? People want to know these things, not listen to elitist moaning.

https://web.archive.org/web/20050404001958/worldofwarcraft.com/realmstatus/
---
This is the first available snapshot from their realmstatus page. The realmstatus page wasn't really available upon launch so it's probably not accurate.
---
So I'm confused. Is the "Of Wrath" spell power gear in at the start or not? Like the "of Shadow Wrath" or "of Firey Wrath" suffixes. If not this changes everything.
---
Maybe you cant hit rank 14, but that's not advised for anyone.
---
If you're in college and you live in dorms then you absolutely have time to do literally everything else and still have time for your studies.
---
ok
---
Perfect time
---
Depends. What are we preserving? Is the classic project just a time capsule, or did vanilla have objectively better game mechanics?
---
If sharding isn’t used in starting zones. A lot of hunters will be made...
---
Me too, actually. The more I think about this, the more I hope they quit with Vanilla. Probably won't happen though.
---
Gimme a “B”! B!
---
Gimme an “L”! L!
---
Cheerleading blizzard for every decision because we’re starving for updates isn’t productive without thinking about what those updates mean. This one means that certain blue items will be BIS and essentially never be replaced for a year if you get an epic in MC that you might have used otherwise. I guess getting all your bis blues will be fast so we can just work on alts at that point. Everyone will be running around in BIS mismatched blues instead of tier gear.
---
its called war mode its Opt in, if u choose to go war mode you get more XP while leveling, and more rewards for daily quests on max level
---

---
oh my god
---
that's my go to lol
---
yeah that’s how raid difficulty works.
---
That's dedication. Are you one of the people with entire speedruns mapped out and vacation days saved up?
---
It's not usable in combat so no, it's really not useful in any of those situations. Really the only use is eat/drink -&gt; shadowmeld when you're worried about being attacked, and shadowmeld next to a base and interrupt them before it ends just to waste time till reinforcements come.
---
flurry axe vs ironfoe? Do extra swings proc consumables?
---
Lmfao, I have the wall scroll of this right next to me, got a bit confused for a second
---
On fresh launch most items are on the AH for vendor price
---
HELL YES
---
Show me the line where they say "exactly that".
---
They talked about how some items would be 1.12 versions like PvP items, yes. But nowhere did they say ALL items would be 1.12 versions.
---
Ironfoe seem to Outperform Flurry in tests. The extra attacks have Seal of Righteousness damage added to them, and both the extra white hit and subsequent SoR hit have a chance to proc the consumables.
---
palas with like tier 1-2 and some spell damage accessories do plenty of consistent damage!  not as high burst as others but its enough to matter
---
the whole point of palas is to out-last your enemy and keep coming like a terminator, not get 3 lucky crits for your pvp movie
---
What do you mean, create a new set of gear? I never said that.
---
They might give us the 1.11 set in phase 2. They might not. The 1.11 sets were added late in vanilla. They've said that items which were added late in vanilla will be added late in Classic.
---
There's a defining difference between an item whose stats were upgraded in some patch, and an item that was added in some patch. They've expressly said that they're treating the two differently.
---
If they give us the 1.11 PvP gear in 1.4, that's an exception to the rule they've just explained to us. An exception that they have made no mention of. Why do you automatically assume they will?
---
Paladin was my first 60 at release. I would guess Ret will be fastest spec to 60. It originally took me 15 days played to get 60 on pld. I don’t think seal of command was in the game until after I was level 40+. You will be able to heal ok but not incredibly well as rest. Blessing of wisdom is helpful to keep from going oom. Some fights will be harder than others to heal - especially princess in mauradon. Happy to chat if you want to PM me
---
I think there will always be a contingent of players who continuously re-roll on Classic Vanilla, even if the rest of the player base moves on to other expansions. We will have plenty of people to play with. I think when they launch BC servers they will simultaneously launch a Fresh Vanilla and the circle of life will start again for 2.5 years. 
---
I think you could re-roll 4 or 5 times on Vanilla over 10-15 years and be perfectly entertained.
---
Exactly. Regardless of what the best farming method is the economy will balance out eventually.
---
For stormwind especially this moment will be very brief as people will create ther bank alts almost instantly
---
not yet
---
can’t wait to gear my character in bis blues in two weeks and never step foot in mc or bwl because they don’t have upgrades for everyone. plus everyone will have the same set made up of half dungeon blues.
---
Dude. I did the exact same thing. As soon as you would summon them the fatigue or breath would start ticking and they would die.
---
There was a server famous moonkin druid guild leader at the time who basically ninja'd Hand of Ragnaros from her guild, her name was Retrodruid on Tichondrius Anyway, my warlock and hunter friend were going along with the troll and we killed a few people before moving to her. She died and we got a huge kick out of it because she had a lot of server drama attached to her and forum threads etc. Well, she messaged our guild leader (Our guild we were in was called ATF) and got me kicked from my raiding guild.... I don't regret it at all. If you're out there Retrojabba, I know you still remember it!
---
Don't be a poser roll Horde!
---
Oh i will for sure still play a lot but just can't hardcore it like i would want to
---
Yep.
---
As long as the items were in the game prior to the 1.10, they'll be using their 1.12 form. Just confirmed by blizz
---
classic is something that will happen once in a lifetime, you can always go back to college....
---
to blizzard.
---
Phat l00tz
---
Ret paladin is the ultimate pain in the ass.  
---
If you are keen enough to keep Schrodinger in your back pocket then you wont have an issue learning the class.
---
i’m not sure you’ve got your nose deep enough into their assholes. maybe you can still get it a little deeper.
---
Ummmm....I was in college when it was originally out. I no-lifed WoW on Saturdays for 10-15 hours and sometimes 8+ hours on Sunday. It can be no-lifed in college depending on your degree. If you are talking Accounting or something like that, probably not. I have a wife and 2 kids now, I'll be happy with 10-15 hours a week.
---
You are defining casual to mean "plays fewer hours." But that is actually the *opposite* of what everyone else is talking about.
---
People are talking about if it's good to run, say, ret paladins and moonkins if that gets people to play more, and casual in this context means "bad specs or PvP specs, but plays a lot and high attendance"
---
Which is actually the opposite of what you're arguing.
---
What happens after Naxx?
---
This just gave me shell shock....
---
yeah but some dungeon blues will now be bis til AQ basically. you’ll be stuck wearing a blue belt you got a week after hitting 60 for a year and a half.
---
Does the level of the character have any effect of the amount gained from defense? I hoped it would.
---
Sometimes I wouldn't buff random people walking by.

None of that changes what I said.  Nobody is going to handicap themselves for no gain.  The people who want the raid to be re-tuned want it to be more difficult for *everyone*, not just themselves. 
---
 It doesn't really matter where that difficulty came from back in the day, the point is that it was there and it won't be there now.
---
/u/magey
---
Make the content you wish to see in the world.
---
Raped and beaten to death im afraid.
---
There's two interpretations of the "final state" of the PvP sets, when it comes to the blue versions.
---
1) The 1.4 set will be in its "final state" from the beginning. The items never change. New items are added in 1.11 to replace them. Normally, this would mean that these do not become available in Classic until patch 1.11.
---
2) The 1.11 sets replace the 1.4 sets from the start, which conflicts with their explanation of adding items only in the patch that they originally arrived in.
---
Unlike literally all other items in the game, the R7-10 PvP set did not have its stats changed later in vanilla, it was replaced with different sets. They haven't made it clear whether they're going to make an exception for these specific items or treat them the same as any other, i.e. the 1.4 version will remain until 1.11 when the new version is added.
---
There is purely speculation. Don’t post this crap until it’s confirmed
---
Correct, and originally the Draenai were meant to be the name of the evil faction and the Eredar were meant to be the good faction. Chris Metzen unfortunately mixed it up during TBC, leading to the current naming.
---
Agreed! Games are meant to be enjoyed, whatever that means to YOU
---
After they added Auction Houses to each main city, Darnassus was my hub city.  It was so empty and lag free.
---
YOU, WHAT DO YOU OWN THE WORLD?!
---
Fairest system I’ve found was in my second raiding guild.  It was dkp but all epics were one price.  All tier set pieces were another price.   You would bid but highest dkp always won.  If it was a tie it was determined by /roll.   It kept guild members from screwing over their own team by purposely overbidding on items that they knew someone wanted or needed.  
---
It is a guild.  You should act as a team.
---
Forget world first 60, or getting the scarab mount, first one into SW or Org is the true winner.
---
Massively outperform? In any case good luck to the paladin going for ironfoe.
---
They were probably just referring to gear
---
So many guilds struggle to get a guild for 20man content in retail, I have no idea how anyone will do it for 40man groups. You gotta have a lot of patience, that’s all I can say.
---
I found hraling hard for a druid without NS for that oh shit heal. This is because you rely on rejuv so much and regrowth sucked up mana hard.
---
With my sub, yes.
---
I didn't play EverQuest (played EQ2) but my first MMO ever was EQOA. Was "training" a thing in EQ1? Because I believe that was my first instance of trolling in online games. I remember gathering huuuuuge pulls of bandits and then running them through groups grinding, while /yelling "CHOO CHOO".........to be young again.. 
---
who am I kidding, if you could train in classic wow I'd still be doing it.
---
Wouldn't kills on people that are grey to you not even net honor, since it would be a Dishonorable Kill? Or is it just a reduced amount of honor. That can't be worth the insane grind it would even take. Plus people are going to grief lower levels a bit anyways, thats world PvP on early wow
---
But there are no quest mobs in Stormwind, so the whole rationale of sharding to make launch more bearable wouldn't apply to that zone.
---
A nerf to the number of instances per hour would shut it down. I don't see a problem with halfing the number of instances you can do per hour. That also solves the mob tagging issue with rough dynamite.
---
I don't think it was missed.  I only casually keep up with classic news and this was a "big update" a month ago.  I was actually going to mention this was information that we already knew but you already pointed that out by mentioning the date.
---
I’m not gonna pretend you have to be “special” to play WoW Classic but I did introduce my 13y.o brother to the game.. 
---
He’s interesting to analyse because he’s your stereotypical teenager - part of the iPad generation as i’d call it. He grew up with the App Store and when he got an Xbox he treats 70$ games like an App Store freebie - he’ll play for 20 minutes and look for the next game offering instant gratification..
---
He was really interested in trying Classic and legit didn’t even make it to level 4 before he logged and doesn’t even like WoW anymore lmao.
---
This is honestly where MOST (obviously not all) kids of his age will fall. They want lootbox unboxing kind of experiences, for example titanforging in Retail would appeal more to them..
---
Classic MMORPGs are surely to grindy for a generation like that. Im not trying to get uppity, its just a very different reward system for playing.
---
They've already stated they are using the 7.3.5 API but with certain functions removed if they feel they are 'against the classic spirit'
---
Even though it wont be the same as then. Cz of the playerbase that has prepared and many will i am afraid go for the fast level optimal etc etc path. Go blind. Try to avoid parties and guilds that go for the fast track. Imo the levelling experience is the best experience in classic and never got surpassed by any expansion. Read every quest find your own way. Don't use any add-ons to help you find things faster. Find friends in-game with the same mindset. And i think it will still be quit an experience.
---
Actually a lot of what I remember loving was how overwhelming it all was. My first MMO, started playing knowing nothing except I liked RPGs like Diablo. Feeling lost, wandering, figuring things out. It was all part of a great early experience. You really feel like you grow as you spend time I the world. So yea. I wouldn't read anything.
---
Challenging Shout is Vanilla.
---
I wish all the people who take this 15 year old game so seriously that they only allow for a handful of specs to be played would just fuck off back to Elysium or whatever other shitty private server they come from so we can enjoy classic without them constantly complaining.
---
Waiting for Thazzrils pick will be a nightmare with no shards.
---
It's patch 1.12 unless stated otherwise.
---
Might have been Mocking Blow. I seem to remember that my fear and one of my Taunts could be silenced.
---
That shaman is glorious
---
Cross-realm BG's for low level brackets and max level brackets can't be compared. On low level a full battlegroup could have like 2-5 BG's active at once, compared to like 20-50 at max level.
---
The number 1 problem this loot system has IMO is adding people into the guild at a later date.    When do you integrate the new players ranking into the primary list?  If your guild has seen 2 Viskags and you are in BWL Patch when you see a third, does that new 2 week recruit fill-in get viskag because 2 other rogues put it was #2?    You could have a streak of bad luck with a class and the mage core you started with eventually rotates to all new mages.

Was active on irc and became friendly with a  hordie (was alliance at the time), we'd use /who or invite  players from our own faction to group and share their location with the other and then gank players for gold or just for banter on the forums. One mage especially I ended up following throughout the world for a good 2 hours. Ended up meeting the irc guy in his home country last summer, was like meeting up with a good friend. Ultimately i guess it's mostly a good memory to me
---
Don't. That site is run by scammers.
---
Good, let them come.
---
That struggle will weed out the weak and forge a stronger server community, if it happens. I'll be one of the people getting camped, I'm sure, but I'm there for the journey, not the epic loot
---
As that “Geared Gnome Warrior that runs lowbies through dungeons for free/escorts them through contested zones. Also that same warrior is the douchebag that controls half of the fish on the AH.”

I always turned on PoF when pugging ToC as  a 13yearold.
---
Thought i was pretty badass
---
They have a constant reactive role though.. Which makes them consistently the worst choice.
---
Best choice is simple, ranged dps like mage/lock. Just /assist macro and spam frostbolt and that's it, undivided attention to the rest of the raid and little movement to do
---
Does this tweet mean they plan to have one, just not right away?
---
Ironfoe wouldn't be any more difficult for a Paladin than a Warrior as long as you make your own groups and tank.

It’s so disingenuous and people just gobble it up because they’re desperate for any vanilla content. It’s so sad.
---
If they don’t recreate all the server names then I hope they at least make suggested clusters. 
---
I.e. a server might be officially called “Stormscale” but would state in parentheses somewhere, “Recommended if your original server was F-L.”
---
Except the user base of Vanilla was constantly and drastically growing throughout its lifespan. Classic will be different.
---
this is why I check Ion's replies, not his tweets, fairly regularly.  he doesn't tweet much of his own accord, just replies, and those don't show up in a feed. He just posted  a reply about classic again today!
---
Ya definitely enjoy college and limit your WoW time. I had switched from no-lifting to on/off by college, and decided to quit completely a couple months off at college as I realized it was going to be interfering too much in my social life. 
---
It’s a good thing I did, I really evolved a lot as person and had so much fun in college, and could not have with no-lifting WoW. You only get to do college once.
---
What's the original film called?
---
This still faces the fundamental problem of people not wanting to forsake the time investment and, more importantly, social connections they've made on their original servers. Especially if they wait any significant amount of time after launch to roll out said server.
---
Yes training was totally a thing in EQ.
---
&lt;The Druid Guild&gt;
---
I think Horde lends itself better than Alliance for this:
---
WC, obvious
---
RFK, rumours of the scourge corrupting the nature there
---
I’m on mobile but I could definitely come up with stuff for most dungeons I think along the lines of returning places such as Mara, BFD etc to their natural state of being, free from corruption.
---
Well they sleep in until 11 am most days. “Content creator” perks!
---
Actually that's a good point - I might even intentionally create toons with a few of the major streamer names on w/e server I join just in hopes they pick another server to play.
---
There's still a lot of MC items that will be upgrades. The phase 1 BiS for most classes will be half MC loot and half dungeon blues, which is fair enough. All in all, 1.12 creates more useful MC loot than true progressive itemization where T1 is total garbage for half the classes.
---
Whoops Commanding Shout is what I was thinking
---
Because it's absurd hyperbole?
---
I didn’t name names, that’s allll you &lt;3
---
The point is he doesn't remember if they were in 1.12 or not.  Wowhead things they arrived in 1.11.x, but I don't see them mentioned in any patch notes.
---
This company could no longer define difficult.   And to think wow classic was considered a game for casuals in its day
---
Bro, on my first character I couldn’t find the bucket of water near the well in the Tauren starting zone. The one that’s like 40 fucking yards from where you start. Such a little newbie back then
---
Yes. It looks good on female Human at least. xD
---
It was only funny the first time.
---
They know it, however if they don't open a rp pvp server it means the request isn't big enough
---
OP is retarded, he's basically pointing out that once Phase 2 begins, the R13 epics are on par with the T2.5 gear from AQ, which won't be released until **PHASE 5** so It'd blow every other type of gear out of the water.
---
It only seriously affects MC/Ony, and let's be honest, that was never going to be challenging anyway. Classic raids will be easier across the board, and 90% of it comes down to the fact that everybody can instantly look up the smallest details of every part of the game, video game difficulty standards have skyrocketed, and we're all playing with a rock-solid 60+ FPS and &lt;50ms. The stats on gear makes an insignificant difference compared to that. Unless they literally change the raid content (which I don't want), only seriously bad/casual guilds will be unable to clear raid content every week. Anyone remotely competent and dedicated will have a 100% weekly clear rate of all relevant content from T1 to T3.
---
Damn that reply was so good I could hear a class of 4th graders "ooooOOOH!"-ing in my head.
---
Same boat. I played horde the entirety of my wow career (vanilla through wrath, quit in wrath), but am slightly interested in experiencing alliance questing. But I think once I hit 60, I’ll wish I would have rolled horde. Also, I think targeting horde players trying to kill them in PvP would go against my natural instincts.
---
&gt; once you put in a server, you can’t get rid of it.
---
Except you absolutely can. Server merges are a thing. I know Blizzard doesn't like them, but they are an option, and one I vastly prefer to the cross-realm buffoonery they've implemented everywhere as an alternative solution.
---
This idea sounds fun, but it's going to take FOREVER to gear up.
---
How about instead of adding RP servers, they add RPPVP servers?
---
Yes them too.
---
Either way, deforestation, pollution and the Chinese are our enemies.
---
What is sharding? This is a term I've never heard before. But I didn't play vanilla... just the end of BC, WotLK, and Pandaria. So what does sharding mean?
---
Tips out did himself this time with a 24min video about a blue post that just confirmed what they already said last time.
---
[This](https://youtu.be/sug4QLrwk-Y) is the video that got me to play WoW back when I was a RuneScape addict. My friend showed this to me and I was oh Shit I have to get wow lol.
---
I will slightly disagree with everyone so far -- instead of going in completely blind, I would read up on the lore of horde/alliance and each race. Even if you're not a lore person, it'll take all of 5 minutes to get a brief overview of the universe, and maybe you'll find a race or class that particularly resonates with you. A tauren hunter who's out to survive on his own and take care of the surrounding lands? An orc warlock who can't quite let go of the demon powers? etc  
---
This won't spoil any gameplay, but it helps you get a vision for your character. It's an RPG after all.
---
k.
---
Happy cake day
---
It does
---
If you want to be a viable melee dps, roll a Warrior or Rogue. If you want to be viable tank roll a Warrior or Druid.
---
Not every class has to be good at every single roll in the game. In Vanilla every class has something they are best at, and an optimal raid/pvp groups setup contain atleast one of every single class.
---
If you want to play a hybrid Mage that can tank raids, play retail.
---
Hey, what's up, guys, it's Tips.
---
Maybe that’s not such a bad thing, if you have it at launch you’ll probably get a lot of people just rolling there because of the smaller que and not actually intending to RP.
---
Lol merges are on top of the ‘worst idea’ list for sure.  They absolutely decimate communities.  I wouldn’t 100% prefer to be on a really low pop realm than have it merged any day.  I feel like most people who have actually experienced their server merged would agree.
---
This is true for the easier raids like Onyxia, MC, ZG, AQ20 and arguably BWL but is definitely not true for AQ40 and especially Naxx. If you get to Naxx and even a quarter of your roster is meme specs, you're not going to make it through unless you change to something more optimal. That's just how vanilla and the power creep worked out in the end.
---
Seems like plan is probably not starting out, but as soon as there's need to add realms it'd be a candidate?
---
Depends. Regardless of everything, it did revitalize low lvl dungeons that were otherwise entirely unused, so there's that.
---
Man that’s fucking dumb, they should have at least one of each type right from the get-go
---
As a non native English speaker I just realized what pre paid actually means lol. We use the same word in my language but I never gave it a second thought

You tell them that you're here to have fun and help each other succeed. As long as you've got forty butts in chairs, you're going for it. Let those who are "too good" leave, and work to improve your dedicated roster and community. You're not building an optimized raid team if you're not enjoying it, you lose group synergy and start having issues with burnout.

And you do this because that's what a leader does. A good leader sticks by his people and finds compromise while solving problems.

Ok if anything gets a buff after all the NOCHANGES screaming from the past god knows how long it needs to be Mana regen for Boomkins, Ret/Prot Palidans, Ele/Enhance Shaman and fucking Shadow priests.

Fucking great, so are they gonna launch with four 5,000 pop servers and then two weeks later realize "awww shit, there's over a million people in queue, maybe we should add 2 more servers"???

---
dont listen to mrmalloc... just go ret until at least lvl 41. you can still heal any dungeon and you friend while leveling very well.
---
many recent guides disagree with going for consecration immediately, because it is very very mana inefficient for the damage. Just go ret. seriously.

---
People here love to hate on Blizzard, but they're a legitimately great company. They have had excellent customer service AND they actually listen to their customers for the 15+ years that I've been involved with them. You could say that they ruined modern WoW, but to me modern WoW is just what happens when you actually listen to your customers and give them what they want.
---
People don't know what they want. But I respect Blizzard for giving it to us anyway.
---
This is great. Fighting against Paladins is a major skill/class check. If you are the wrong class or the wrong build, or simply lack knowledge in the matchup, you will lose almost every time.  
---
If you are one of the classes that can destroy paladins 1v1 (mage/warlock/priest/shaman/rogue) and know what you are doing, the Paladin is probably the most vulnerable class in the game, especially without engineering.

---
First of all, we won't. Populations will fluctuate and there will be smaller and larger population servers and if you want to be on one but are not on one, you can choose to roll there. Unless you are concerned that you only have one more full leveling effort left in you.
---
Blizzard classic servers do not quote-unquote die the way people laughingly believed that private servers did.
---
Very standard pure PvE spec you have there, BoSanc isnt entirely necessary, youll need to coordinate who has it with other pallys in your guild.
---
Otherwise, Lasting Judgement isnt very good, Consecrate can occasionally be used in raids, but youll really miss out on its utility outside of raids in farming, PvP or dungeons, and hey, its only 1 point. 
---
Id also dump the last point in Lasting Judgement for Unyielding Faith, helps with raiding a bit and PvP as well. Also consider dumping 3% hit for Imp HoJ purely for PvP. 
---
SoL and SoW sound well and good, but in practice they almost never get used. SoW was more for when people came to raids unprepared and you expected a really really long fight. With mana regen consumes and pots/runes, theres no reason people should need SoW and if youre thinking, just put it on anyways since itll help, well it means the Paladin wont be playing optimally simply because others werent prepared for raids. SoL healing is inconsistent and marginal at best. Lastly 16 debuff slots may sound like a lot, but it can still get pretty tight, so often times you wont be using SoL or SoW.
---
No. Buffing those things actively changes the game. Tuning damage and health values just prolomgs fights.
---
Well at least thats something
---
Right. 'Cause we haven't been champing at the bit to play Classic for the last year and a half just like everyone else here.
---
We've no idea how long we might be waiting on RPvP realms. Most of us won't be willing to. So when they eventually come along we'll have to choose between the realm type we original wanted and the characters and connections we've made on our current servers.
---
Which, again, only delays the fragmenting of community they're ostensibly trying to avoid here.
---
Ive heard of loot list, but no experience. What you describe doesn't sound flushed out enough. I'd want the lists to be public and certainly something about taking into account the last time you looted.
---
Personally used loot council for 5+ years. Think we lost 2 players over it, though doubt LC was the only reason. Basically there was no room for biases. There was a set order of criteria to evaluate until we came to a winner. If it was a tie, used a roll off. Priority was: longest since last loot(down to the day), is it an obvious large upgrade for someone bidding(so obvious usually people would retract their bid for that person to get it), attendance %, performance in raids (only penalizing someone who's had obvious problems like dying every fight or afk'ing and holding up the group a lot)... in that order until someone bidding came out on top or roll off. 
---
Rarely it ever went past the 3rd criteria. On occasion when someone complained, I'd sit with them after raid and just go through the criteria list and where they stood on it. Usually that was more then enough to calm any worries. We were very upfront with how we came to decisions. 
---
I'd join a guild using LC for classic, as long as they had a clear ordering of criteria for handing loot out to be consistent. Though I plan to target a DKP system most likely. I like the idea of accumulating points for consistency. Though with some scaling system to assure DKP isn't overly hoarded. I've heard of a few different strategies for that.
---
[See this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bho23n/itemization_in_wow_classic/)
---
No more PvP servers. Just one type of server (not PVE and PvP), but some are RP also.
---
Your opinion sucks!
---
https://youtu.be/csxIX9XK20g Here you go, it’s Alex talking about it. Quickest one I could find since I’m at work atm, haven’t looked for a Tips pov
---
Here's what I think will happen:
---
Sometime in June we'll get a release date and a short open beta lasting until launch in late July or early August. They'll release the server list at the same time.
---
For the next month and a half, everybody starts planning their server and class and whatnot. This sub will be flooded with "[EU-Whateverdale-H] &lt;This Here Guild&gt; starting up, visit our site and apply!" Honestly, there will have to be a new sub just for guild stuff.
---
Halfway through this stage, it will begin to become clear that some realms are "destination servers." The biggest guilds from private servers (e.g. Dreamstate, Nope/Apes) announce their realm of choice, as do the big streamers. Everyone else will then be able to decide whether they want to be on a realm with a huge playerbase and community emphasis, or one that isn't filled to the brim with unbearably retarded twitch chat types.
---
This place will be drowning in polls asking what class, race, gender, region and realm classification you want to play. Then the game will launch and it'll turn out that none of those polls provided results anywhere remotely close to reality. You'll all end up choosing whatever your friends want three days before launch.
---
And then the big day finally arrives. We all pour our lives into Classic for two weeks and then it turns out that the servers that host the big guilds/streamers have become no-go zones for anyone over 30 with a mentality to match their age, yet simultaneously the only servers that anyone gives a shit about. A handful of realms per region will come to be considered the "real realms" which are taken much more seriously with regards to PvP, content creation and drama.
---
Anyway, it will quickly become abundantly clear which realms become megaservers because the big names will announce where they go, and their witless fans will follow.
---
People would pay good money to wipe their mind and go into this blind, I know I would.
---
Try the site in the way back machine
---
Depends how you plan/kill. You can make it to 60 without having to just grind, but many quests do have you kill a bunch of creatures, so there is a lot of that. 
---
Personally, my favorite way to fill in a few levels is by doing lots of dungeons. It’s fun to play challenging content with 4 other people as you get to know them, and get awesome, satisfying loot.

Honest question, do you have to rp while pvping on these realms? Do you have the option to world PvP or rp in a city? What’s the difference?
---
Or it means they didn't acknowledge the demand for it because they have it in their heads we're a niche community and nothing is going to shake that perception.
---
The only way to accurately gauge the popularity of RPvP is to have one such realm available *at launch* in each major region.
---
Otherwise the community will fracture as all the RPvP nerds who've been champing at the bit for this game for the past year and a half settle on other servers because we've no way of knowing how long we might be waiting for the realm type we want to eventually roll out.
---
Then when it does happen we have to choose between the server type we original wanted and the characters and connections we've made on our present servers. Thus ensuring exactly the sort of community fragmentation they're ostensibly trying to avoid here.
---
There's a fleshed out version of the game already with more races you can rp as. I don't want to sound like a dick but wouldn't RPing on the live game be better with all the shit they've added over the years? What is everyone gonna be walking around in grey quality twill?
---
Wednesday?
---
Maybe being unable to beat content without flasks just means your raid group isn't very good.
---
Judgement of wisdom gives free mana to mages, warlocks, and hunters. If mage isn't spending time evocation, they are doing more dps. If a warlock isn't spending time lifetapping they are doing more dps. If a hunter doesn't need to downrank multishot they are doing more dps.
---
Someone nerdier than me will have to come in here and do the calculus on this one, but I have a feeling JoW is worth the spot.
---
We will get a whole new generation of PvP videos devoid of fraps.com watermarks and the Microsoft Movie Maker newspaper overlay.
---
morning raiding?
---
Warmode killed emerald dreams world pvp culture. Shame.
---
You're exactly right; we don't know how popular RPvP will be. Thing is, neither does Blizzard.
---
What we do know is not having RPvP available as an option at launch will *guarantee* we never know how popular it might be. Because by the time Blizz gets around to rolling out an RPvP server a substantial portion of those who would have liked to play on such a server will have already established themselves on other realms, and a substantial portion of those won't want to forsake the time and, more importantly, social investments they've made there.
---
So they are going to do what private servers and original vanilla did which is appeal to the FRESH HYPE phenomenon.  Great, can't wait for people to leave my server to play on a new "fresh" server.  This will kill off many servers.  They are just repeating history now.
---
I had completely forgotten about this movie.
---
I wish it had stayed forgotten.
---
So all we have to do is wait another 12 years?
---
Great. I'll get right on that.
---
so should I not play at launch, and just wait till you add a RP-PvP server, or...?
---
&gt; Classic will be different.
---
Why?
---
I don't see that happening
---
8-12 pm central time zone
---
I mean if dying constantly and being ineffective is fun, more power to you.
---
Shadowmeld + drink is insane for any class that uses mana. If you try to drink mid-fight without Shadowmeld, the other team is going to notice and go out of their way to interrupt you. With Shadowmeld? You can drink mid-fight for as long as your teammates can stay alive without you. And you need to drink a LOT in Vanilla.
---
it is what we have decided on as of now it might change though.
---
Bravo sir. Well said! This is also why I am NOT going to roll a warrior (my original vanilla toon) because I am expecting the class to be grossly overplayed, and the last thing I want is for literally everyone to explain how my vanilla experience was wrong and I MUST do (fill in the blank) differently now, because pserver this, min/max that, blah blah blah blah...  
---
Leaves me wishing that Blizzard would implement changes behind the scenes only to make the game more difficult and different from what the pserver crowd expects. I mean, imagine if duel-weilding warriors carried an additional hit penalty that nobody saw coming, leaving them as a weak DPS class and forced to tank? Or what if paladins were secretly tweaked so Ret was a viable DPS spec?  
---
Those kinds of things could go almost unnoticed on the surface at first, while players struggled to realize the difference between their vaunted pserver experience and what Blizzard actually ends up producing. JUST LIKE IN VANILLA. #nochanges #youthinkyoudobutyoudont #backatyou #hownowbrowncow #hnnnnngh
---
12am? Just making sure so people don't get the wrong idea, haha
---
I don't think there will be mixed guilds. You'll have a ton of casual guilds and a handful of hardcore guilds. The two wouldn't mix because one player wants progression and the other doesn't really care because they're there to be social and have a good time. It's destroyed guilds I've been in because the casual players don't pull weight in raids resulting in the high dps leaving guild in search of better players.
---
Because you spelled it wrong?
---
Are they only having three servers though? I understand not wanting to have too many servers but I don't see why they can't take a server that would otherwise be PvP and make it RP-PvP.
---
Let's be honest here. It' very likely Blizzard doesn't want the extra work involved with a RP realm.   
---
I agree they should have them. But I would be anything they don't want the extra GM work involved.  But maybe after launch a few months later they will make some RP servers.      
---
I can easily see the Classic team (and the GMs) deciding to not make the extra work for themselves by having to address reports of players breaking rules on Classic RP servers.
---
Thank God... I've actually taken to scrolling through and downvoting anything remotely "elitest" or pserver related, just out of spite.
---
no changes means no changes
---
Yea sorry 8pm to 12am
---
Will that drop in the first phase tho? I thought that whole set was added in a later patch.
---
Bit of desolace, bit of ashenvale, bit of alterac, bit of arathi, bit of shimmering flats.
---
STV would be best of course but assuming it's a gankfest there's no point.  However, with the fact that the honor system isn't implemented in phase 1 it might make sense to try STV and see if it's that bad.  I suspect it wont be as bad as it is on private servers because of this.
---
this tweet was made a month ago.

Great stuff!@
---
The level 58 set was not in the game in 1.12 it was replaced by a level 60 set. We will get the level 60 set.
---
Since you're going melee, you can take the 5 points out of imp concussive shot and get Entrapment.
---
I cant wait to be playing Classic and OSRS at the same time.
---
I think it'll be a clusterfuck for a lil while. Everyone loves stv, especially the pvpers. So they'll def be there. It just won't be lvl 60s ganking it'll be 35-40s
---
I never said it was an ideal solution, nor did I say I'd prefer to be on a dead realm. What I *did* say is server merges, bad as they are, are a better solution than cross-realm shenanigans, which is the solution Blizzard opted to go with instead.
---
Server merges suck, but you come out the other side with at least the prospect of a newly revitalized community. No, it doesn't always work that way, but at least it's a possibility. As opposed to cross-realm crap, where community simply ceases to be a thing at all because you'll never see the same people twice in all your time playing.
---
My thought behind that choice was that the stun could be really helpfull to get into the melee range of casters, or do you think concussive shot/wyvern sting itself would be good enough for that?
---
This is really good news.  Start with few servers, bring new ones online (literally within hours if needed) as they fill up.
---
The expectation is that Classic will see an enormous population spike on launch, which will rapidly decline to a much lower, long-term population once people get burned out on leveling etc.
---
Blizzard is expecting this too, hence the decision to implement starter zone sharding.
---
Just opening a crapton of servers at launch and then trying to merge them once the population drops is a terrible idea; in fact it's such a terrible idea that it can be held partially responsible for the failures of several other MMOs. This is why Blizzard will do limited sharding, and why they'll be veyr conservative with releasing additional servers, particularly of the more niche types.
---
So from what I remember the pvp set was buffed at a certain point? Maybe they will leave it in its old “gimped” state until aq/naxx phase?
---
How are they gonna know the demand is high post-launch. All they can go by is word-of-mouth, and that’s something they have had to heard by now.
---
Cant wait to hand out rough bronze shoulders to noobs again!
---
Go in blind and you will understand the nostalgia that the rest of us will experience as you teach yourself the game.
---
Me and my friend have had Mastercard Debits since we were 15ish in Australia.
---
I don't understand. Can you please explain to me what you think I am projecting?
---
It's like pre big bang ms, slow leveling, you don't hit like a truck and everything is just generally harder.
---
Yes, being in a form makes no difference, the only difference is you can't see your mana (but a mod can fix that easily enough).

&gt; The purple PvP set -is- top tier, and you'll find nothing better until Naxx.
---
So?  What does it matter?  Are you afraid someone will grind 100 hours of PVP instead of 100 hours of PVE to get the BiS gear?
---
I’m afraid many people will have Naxx level gear long before Naxx becomes available
---
I hated that anime
---
&gt;100 hours of PVP
---
what, to get rank 10? i hope you dont mean rank 14.
---
Well give it a shot it only takes 20h or so to reach 20 depending on your choice horde or alliance that’s 1 or 2 dungeons you can experience to see if you even like it.
---
The best way I ever saw this work was in TBC. I raided as a BM hunter, hordeside. The guild organized the raid by assigning a group leader to handle their 5-man group. Each group leader was responsible for recruiting new players and assigning builds, etc.  
---
My group leader was a phenomal player with tons of experience. Within a few weeks, I was able to top DPS meters in the raid routinely, even though I only had a couple peices of tier gear. Everything else was a hodgepodge assortment of w/e I could get my hands on. (I'd like to thank Cheeky's spreadsheet for that).  
---
Most guilds would've looked at my gear and snubbed me - but because I played hard, prepped like a madman and had a PERFECTLY formed group, my toon was a rockstar!  
---
I never really got to know anyone in that guild outside of my 5-man group, and I loved it that way. We were a tight-knit group, and we played hard. (well, with one exception being the other BM huntress - she was kindof an idiot and even with far better gear I never "lost" to her, in either damage done, damage received or pretty much any other stat, but somebody thought she was cute so she got whatever she wanted). But I learned that each group in our raid team was like that, and it was sorta that way in the best Vanilla raids I had done, too.  
---
Building those small groups in raids is sooo much fun - and cuts wayyyyy down on the drama in the guild, because it's "just us" and in my experiences we were always proud of our contributions as a GROUP!
---
There’s a recruitment tab but no recruitment tab for classic so here I am. The guild (hopefully to be named) Ganksters is an alliance guild recruiting for vanilla in NA (PvP server) with a spot for everyone here. We plan on raiding Wed 8pm-12am central (I guess that makes us a moderate raiding guild) and doing guild pvp (premades and just organized world pvp) but if you’re a more casual player looking for a classic community you’re welcome as well. Check us out at discord.gg/bFkkKdu
---
When the top raiders get into AQ they will be completely decked out in BWL gear. When they get into Naxx they will in all the best AQ gear.  
---
Having a few members in rank 14 that sacrificed their health/job/family for 6 weeks to achieve is going to make absolutely no difference, they'll be running through that content like butter regardless. It might mean their first patchwerk logs are 1:30 kills instead of 1:40. Don't think I'll lose any sleep over it.

Such an exciting thought. No "expansions" just new content based in old world Azeroth. Unf
---
the only thing im disappointed about is no original AV; but i still dont feel like itll be zerg city even now obviously. and one disappointment amidst genuine effort to create a fun oldschool game is hardly a bad thing
---
Yea this point really needs clarification.
---
So?
---
The first guy who gets the Lionheart Helm recipe is gonna be rich haha
---
It wasn't meant to be technically accurate.  It was posing the question: why do you care?
---
the purple pvp set is roughly equivalent to Tier 2, not naxx.
---
evidence: [R14 gear](https://classic.wowhead.com/transmog-set=825/field-marshals-threads), [T2 gear](https://classic.wowhead.com/transmog-set=664/nemesis-raiment), [T3](https://classic.wowhead.com/transmog-set=666/plagueheart-raiment)
---
as you can see, R14 is about the same ilvl as T2, while T3 is 15-20 ilvls higher
---
I didn't steal from shops.
---
I stole my brother's credit card when he was asleep, wrote down the information on a place of paper, and placed his card back in his wallet.
---
He never found out.
---
In what order are harmful spells dispelled? First on first off, or last on first off? Does vindication have pvp implications based on dispelling?
---
 Dude most people showing up in greens wont crush motlen core. Unless there very good players who know strats to a tee and did MC before etc.
---
I was in a guild on a private server who repeatedly wiped in MC/RAG we all had half decent gear.
---
Your issue is 40 people and you need to get lucky grabbing people qho are not full blown retards
---
Concussive Shot is a 1 chance every cooldown, and it's 20% only, you'll be in melee range most of the time and you won't be able to cast it, Entrapment is better because you can drop a Frost Trap that will tick for almost a minute and can get you more procs, and you can have a uptime close to 100% because feign death is 30sec cooldown only, and it's also 25% chance.
---
Um have fun with that
---
Alright, thanks for your detailed reply!
---
I loved this post
---
for those of us that don’t know, what is the interaction?
---
To expand on this if we have more than one server which we will obviously that subset of the community will only be spread over a handful of servers. Honestly I’m making sure I don’t roll on the “reddit server” why? Cause you guys are a great source of info but I also don’t want to compete with every single 1% in here. I want to join a realm that’s not just pushing top end content because I know I won’t be for a while.
---
They've been saying everything will be 1.12 versions because that's the version they have.

---
No where there or in the rest of that post did they mention using anything other than 1.12 stats.   For some reason people just assumed they might as it wasn't stated they would. 
---
If they don't specifically say they are deviating from 1.12 for something then they are using 1.12.
---
That's because people want all the fun little things they remember as being cool.  It was cool when you could get pets that did neat things like that.  There are scores of fun little moments people remember, without being super nerdy about what patch did what.  They want that fun moment recreated.
---
He probably knows that, due to better itemisation it can be as good as or better than some naxx gear depending on the class. Some people just can't handle the idea that pvp gear may have some use in pve, it fries their brain or something (even though the reverse is true for basically the entirety of WoW for 14 years hehe).

You were right I was looking on mobile and didn't see it. Thanks!

It's the correct and only answer.

amen. if they think having to fight other people for hundreds of hours and sleepless nights over the course of weeks and months, competing against your entire faction the entire time, isn't "earning" the gear you have, cry more.
---
Go in blind but be willing to accept advice. If you are going in blind you are probably going to spec wrong and play wrong in groups. If someone brings it up, think about what they say.
---
YouTube program? Bruh windows movie maker is the only way to go
---
I kind of think the fact they have to address an RP-PVP realm means they might need one.
---
I hope so
---
I expect the server with esfand/staysafe on alliance side and tipsout on horde and some other small classic streamers to be big, you also have some guilds that will roll horde to balance things out, most of the Nostalrius and private server community will most likely roll on the same servers. As long as you watch people who stream private servers on twitch or is in one of the discords, you'll know beforehand which ones are going to be the mega pvp servers.
---
Nah m8 someone needs to reapply blessings. Why have a healer have to stop healing to do it?
---
I wish. I don’t make content or stream. I’m just an internet troll getting downvoted by internet trolls.

I will absolutely play a feral druid with a hybrid tank/dps spec. But I won't be raiding. My goal in Classic is going to be completing every quest, every 5 man dungeon, and max out my professions. Maybe I'll get in on a few entry level raids but I'd much rather experience the rest of the world and help other people level up. 
---
I'm kinda burned out on raiding.  There's this huge world full of content and everyone's focus is always on the end game.  I don't think I'm going to play like that this time around.
---
For a long time it wasn't. When TBC introduced Resilience and such, you would get globaled in PvP if you weren't wearing resilience gear. It was like this for many expacs after that.
---
How much?
---
I'm a pretty big weeb and never watched this one because I heard it had a downer ending, anyone mind spoiling it for me I'm curious.
---
This is great! Any plan to open source it? I'd love to see how it works
---
It's worth doing at least once just to experience all of the other zones, quests, etc. I started alliance and went horde. No regrets about playing alliance.
---
Real talk
---
Hi, used elder nightsaber 1.4, both claw and bite, using both
---
The Owl was slower, mainly down to being a 2.0 pet. Screech was useful but the higher dps of the cat won out. The difference was about 10% overall.
---
Yes r14 is strong. But it will never be "bis" for pve just a close version that will make it easier for you and others to get gear upgrades.
---
Yes weapons are strong. But you have to see it from another perspective. Some no lifer spends 20hrs a day for 4+months so you can progress gear easier and have less competition
---
Are you?
---
On the same page as you man. Thinking about Hunter or Holy pala. Only have time for One char. Hunter Will give me freedom to pve PvP farm etc with the same spec almost. Holy pala Will give me insta invite to pve stuff but its not as fun in pvp and I cant farm shit.
---
The guards were definitely in by 1.12. I think originally the neutral towns like BB/Gadget didn't have any guards and were just ridiculous gank fests but they added them in pretty quick.  
---
They did have little holiday events a couple of times where the neutral town guards were disabled for a weekend or something as a little ode to the old days, that might be what people remember. No guards at all sounds fun but would actually be a huge pain in the arse.
---
Calm down princess.
---
it'd be like the WoW southpark episode
---
What are the odds of there being Naxx pugs on Classic servers (assuming a normal/balanced server population)? 
---
Players in 2019 will have access to infinitely more information than they did 15 years ago, so I imagine it it will be much easier to find the gear/resistance/consumable requirements/expectations. 
---
On a slightly comparable level, our server would pug a fair amount of mythic bosses in Legion with our smallish server raiding community. It was fairly successful and fun. ^^^until ^^^BFA ^^^completely ^^^killed ^^^it
---
If you want to get invited to PUG raids... then yes, you will. You’ll be able to solo well, and PVP... but damage meters exist, people look at them, and through no fault of yours your number will be low. 
---
Have fun and play a warrior if you want to hit stuff.
---
This is getting kinda cringy.
---
Horde for life, I’d feel dirty rolling alliance
---
I have an eye of shadow (BOE) on my old priest, what’s the best way to sell it? I see that it’s possibly worth 1 million+ on TUJ, seems like a bit of a specialty item though..
---
I was looking to see when they were added but didn't see it mentioned anywhere for certain.
---
What are the advantages of an RP PvP realm versus a PvP realm? Back in the day I only played on a PvP realm so I never got to experience what an RP realm was like.
---
Hurrah for your answer. I appreciate it, and agree.
---
Eh people went back the entirety of vanilla just to get thunderfuries from MC for their tanks even when everything else was shard status. I think it'll be fine if a couple slots are no longer upgrades. It's not like it wasn't already like that with some pieces like devilsaur.
---
I don't believe the internet runs on Mountain Dew and Doritos - I'm fairly certain is runs on hatred, drama, and pure salt.
---
I see it happening organically if Blizz doesn’t do it themselves.
---
Yeah, the private servers that came out years and years ago. The modern ones are pretty accurate. Still some things that might change but I think it's mostly gonna be the peoyc chances of weapons like Ironfoe that is way off in either direction on private servers.
---
You clearly misunderstood the post and responded in the rudest way possible. I'm new to vanilla. I don't know what Naxxramas is. I was asking what WoW veterans think would happen once Classic has been out for roughly as long as WoW was still in its vanilla state.
---
Somehow, you managed to assume that I was one of the people saving up vacation days and mapping out a speedrun and then you call me ungrateful. I never begged for Classic and I could not be more excited for it. Unless I'm missing something, you have this completely backwards. I'm just some guy reading the original WoW manual trying to get the most authentic experience possible.
---
On another note, I'm not asking what to do after Naxxramas (whatever that is). I'm asking what OTHERS will do when they finish the game. If everyone just does a speedrun and leaves, it's gonna suck for the new players.
---
Me too. 
---
I'm sorry.
---
If the guy would release the code to the site or something that way the resource will still exist for people who still play on progressive Private Servers.
---
The joy is in the journey for me, I can take my time haha
---
*Almost* completely blind.
---
The only I would personally research would be the classes/specs. You definitely don't want to dedicate hundreds of hours into a class that you hate. 
---
Just look up the "Life at 60" posts on the subreddit and read through each class - decide on one that suits your personal style.
---
Keep the content up. We need our classic fix, we are already addicts again and game is not out yet.
---
Thank you for the entertainment while we wait :)
---
See I was leaning Alliance just because I like the Night Elf culture a little more than the taurens, and part of my dilemma was thinking why would the druids care about something like the deadmines?
---
Wow, I never knew about that. That is one epic retcon, to be sure.
---
What happens is that you’re now paying attention to something nobody can 100% know and is thus subjective which moves the focus away from the points that’s been trying to be made thar are actually legit. 
---
19%. 20%. 30%. 70%.  What matters is that people are gonna lose motivation. And this change is adding to that - not helping.
---
Yes this. As raid leader I finally told people that I was done organizing their fun. If they wanted to show up ready to go (including run speed enchant on boots!!), and correctly specced I’d lead the raid and facilitate them having fun. 
---
This worked out pretty well... we got server-first Sartharion 3-drakes, cleared TK/SSC before the attunement was lifted... 
---
In our prime we had a fully transparent loot council, and it was amazing. We’d kill a boss and everyone told me who got what loot since they’d all already calculated it. +1 for rational adults!
---
They stated no
---
There’s that word again.
---
Thanks. Must have missed that.
---
Sadly it was dying long before.
---
Too many "PvP bros" drove the RPers aka the people who created and nurtured the WPvP community of the server away.
---
By the time Warmode showed up ED was a shell of its former self.
---
Windows movie maker was gangsta
---
I don't plan on going crazy hard with Classic since whenever I go crazy hard, I end up burning out of whatever game/expansion and hate myself for it.
---
With that being said, my end goals are to achieve rank 10 via BGs, then maybe full t1/t2 or so - nothing too crazy.
---
What level did you test it at?
---
Get them servers ready Ion!!! You may need some backup!
---
Not really. Legion broke world pvp &amp; people stopped caring.
---
It's sad.
---
Same here.  I won't be using Quest Helper or any other addon that makes questing easier. My goal is to read and complete every quest. 
---
I'll use other quality of life addons, like Cartographer and Gatherer, but nothing that's going to hold my hand while I'm playing the game.
---
Basically: a pair fall in love in youth. But life gets in the way, and in time they drift apart. It's a beautiful movie though, despite being sad.
---
I think my server is one of the original launch servers. I recall it being quite low population when I quit playing at the end of MoP... I wonder if I'd even be able to sell anything on there.
---
Paladins are absolutely broken tier in both pve and pvp I don't understand how anyone would even try to contest this.
---
It is not so much the content, which is of course raping the obvious cash cow that is classic, which is whatever, everyone is doing it. It's the freaking thumbnails that get me. These are grown men making these thumbnails... just put the logo or maybe your characters in game on it
---
Don't listen to this guy. Drop college. No life WoW is the only way.
---
No changes except for the changes. Like 1.12 talents, no progressive itemization, etc.
---
This is what confuses me, and maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong but...
---
 
---
Didn't Ion specifically give Emerald Dream, which at one point was the largest and most active RP-Pvp server, a shout out during one of his Q&amp;As or some time he was speaking?
---
I can clearly remember that and it wasn't too long ago.
---
If I recall it was about phasing or sharding. He said something like "ED we hear you."
---
That leads me to believe knows peoples desire for this, please Blizzard... reconsider.
---
[the horribly slow murderer with the extremely inefficient weapon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1301160/)
---
Why do you need blizzard to seperate this? Just ask the guild....
---
Well it's a bit of a paradox because they're great in 1v1 and 1v2, but simultaneously a complete dumpster fire in pretty much all other scenarios.
---
When you see a ret in a BG you know for a fact they will spend all their time running around in midfield, getting their seals dispelled and doing white hits while completely neglecting to heal their team or use CC properly.
---
You said "We have fond memories of vanilla" but now your saying your new.
---
There's no way to back this claim up. We don't have Blizzard's codebase so we can't verify it, and anecdotally the bosses all still seem much easier than on retail.
---
For instance, you can kill Ragnaros in 2 minutes, in greens and blues, on *a major private server I cannot name* right now. That's not Blizzlike. The crushings alone should be 1-shotting the tank, and most of Raggy's other abilities should be 1-shots too.
---
I am going to be holy paladin for dungeons and will do for raids. What about leveling. I will mostly be with my warrior friend and mage friend we want to level together what do you recommend in this case?
---
I loved repentance,  It probably wasn't an ideal build but damn if that 1 skill didn't frustrate the hell out of people back in my old days.  The fun in playing Paladin was always tossing dispel over there, buffing this dude over here, Smacking the shit outta this guy then dumping that clutch heal to swing the fight.  I felt like my toolkit was so huge than only doing 1 thing was a disservice.
---
I like how you think, have an upvote
---
“Ohhh.. that’s a big boy, isn’t he?!” 
---
Haha
---
I'd like the option for free realm transfers once RP-PVP realms come in some way. Patch 1.11 included transfers because there are a lot of people who played on RPPVP realms back then and would like to again.
---
Not really? Nah, you're wrong. Before Legion people were pissed about all the toys being used in WoD. All while the server became more popular bringing in more people who didn't respect who and what the server was.
---
It was slowly dying and waiting for the final nail in the coffin.
---
Hell no. At least I hope not.
---
Go for Bjarn! I love going for that silver elite white bear on my hunters.
---
Solid tank that does any and all 5 mans (and BRD to the point of insanity for Iron Foe).
---
Ask nicely is the key, but not every GM is nice aswell. It definitely does work sometimes though, just ask for an hour or so and it'll be seen as totally reasonable
---
I knew you would say that. I was going to clarify. I do have fond memories of vanilla. My dad introduced me to it when I was 8 or 9. He was a hardcore player. I used to run around by myself (eventually with my friend) and whenever I got ganked my dad would come in and destroy the guy. It was really fun. I wasn't doing much (no dungeons, raids, or whatever you do normally). Just killing stuff and selling loot. I am new to vanilla in the sense that I know almost nothing about it, especially past level 20ish. Even if I did know some stuff back then, I would have forgotten it by now.
---
Not everyone is a hardcore speedrunner. There is more than one way to enjoy a game.
---
A positive comment about the ClassiCast? ON MY REDDIT??
---
I will ask you to leave this kind of behaviour at the door. 
---
But I love me some ClassiCast and all the different podcasts we have about Classic. Helps me do some more mundane tasks and temper my hype for the summer. (Hopefully not september!)
---
Yea while that stuff is worth a fortune, they can take months if not years to sell. When it does tho...
---
But yea, not worth trying to sell in a short time tbh
---
I’m curious if just opening up character creation and server choice before launch would solve some of these issues. Streamers, premade guilds and discord communities could sign up and and everyone else could make their decisions on whether they want to join, oppose or avoid those servers. 
---
There’s already been a ton of posts with concerns over choosing the wrong server for whatever reason. So many more variables this time around with social media, streamers etc.  Here’s how it could possibly work....
---
Servers would show a % full number, not faction balance. Blizzard would have its own internal faction lockout if one side reaches X%.  X would have to be enough to allow for some imbalance but not enough to ruin the faction dynamic. At that point the server would be available only to the other faction.  A number of servers that died before x-realms first suffered significant faction imbalance. The dominant side would have to wait forever for Q’s and the dominated side would have every flight point camped into oblivion. 
---
I think this would help offset the number of dead  servers down the road. Basically it could front load the server migration work that will inevitably happen.  Players could discover where the megaservers are and choose accordingly. And I’m sure Blizzard would prefer to any extra cost/dev time to be accrued before launch. 
---
Just a thought
---
Druid has a quest in the ST - it's not necessary for the class as it's just items, but they're good slot holders until DM is released.
---
Ashamed to say I did the same thing, only in Target.
---
I would pick up the box, place it in a magazine rack, then open the box and take the time card out all while pretending I was browsing through the magazine section.
---
People are excited for Classic for both nostalgia and game mechanics. Just because you have fond memories of younger years doesn't mean that those games were necessarily bad. Vanilla was a fantastic game with awesome RPG mechanics and a community that you don't see anymore these days. Though I believe the mechanics in vanilla are what made it great, I also believe the mechanics in TBC and Wrath are what made those games great and memorable. I think Wrath did a great job of balancing the game to make it a bit easier for players as well as retaining the tight communities that made it what we remember today.
---
What ever happened to that? I remember it vividly when death knights were new but I don't remember seeing in in MoP.
---
Oh you.
---
Well if they do add it later, they could give free transfers from all PvP servers to that RP-PvP server. Otherwise yeah, not sure how it would work out.
---
Mages and warriors are very good aoe levelers.  If you are ALWAYS with one of them you can level just fine as holy.  If you are mixed solo group, I would still level ret and just use int gear to do dungeons as a healer.  Wait to respec pure holy at 60.
---
Yep this is it! Wow these materials are really quite something, especially at that time in the game. It must feel really good as a hunter to slap this on Rhok'delar.
---
Blizzard confirmed that everything besides content will be in it's 1.12 state. So that wand "Should" be present.
---
lmao
---
Wait... so you can go into enemy zones and you can't be attacked in a pvp world? What's the point of a pvp world then?
---
The fastest you can get rank 14 is 3 months if you’re literally the #1 honour farmer every week. 
---
If you’re anything but #1 it can take waaay longer. The system destroys your spirit towards the end when you lose progress when only a few players out farmed you. It’s like you think people decked in this gear will be all over the place lol. 
---
The blue set will take most people that set their mind to it a month and is about the power of tier 1. Some pieces a bit better some a bit worse. 
---
Where is the problem here? It really seems like you don’t know what you’re talking about. Updated epic pvp gear is bwl level and almost no one will have it before bwl. Seems like you’d rather pvp gear be strictly worse than pve gear despite it being significantly more difficult to obtain.
---
On my Hunter in BC when Kara usually took a lot of guilds 2 nights, I would invite someone from some random raid I knew had probably stopped at curator, promote them to leader and hop into Kara, into their guild's raid ID. Then I would use invis pots engineering items and hunter FD to get to chess event and solo it. I posted the guild I took it from and the gear I got on our realm forums. I did this for like 4 weeks straight and everyone knew I was doing it but they kept falling for it and I never got in trouble from a GM or anything. 
---
Me and my friends used to do all kinds of raid ID stealing shenanigans when we were young little shits. We held a guild's Vashj attempts hostage until they booted a guy we didn't like out of their guild. They complied and we let them raid.
---
HOW DO YOU IWN DISORDEEEEEERRRRREEERRRRRR?!
---
Wow. You shower?! :D
---
Fresh is true. If it isnt catered to this whole thing is be for not. 
---
Try not to use “toxic” in anything. It’s a fucking over used buzzword and you look like a pansy using it.
---
Should I remove mine?
---
Oh, I didn’t know that.  I mostly just played on my twink.  That was so much fun grinding out gold and getting it ready and the. Just jamming wsg. I really enjoyed it.
---
I remember watching people drop money in the Freeport bank vault and locking scroungers in.  This was before they disabled dropping money.  Good times.
---
No guilty pleasures man, you own that shit.

Everyone is different, but to me college is the perfect place to be playing classic.  You may have visions of no-life grandeur, but there is nothing worth doing that you cant accomplish alongside your first semester.
---
Have a great time.  I'm excited for you.  As the other fellow said:  try and get out there and revel in the glory of not living at home for the first long stretch of your life.  
---
Dont get me wrong - Definitely play a shitload of wow, but set time aside to meet some college bros and bras.
---
From the top of my head, screech from westfall fleshrippers at level 15 or so. Dive is much later, I remember mid level 30s for that in arathi. Claw comes from alot of stuff. 
---
Owls are amazing, they can hold aggro on 2-3 mobs while you burn them with multi shot. Spend all your mana on mend pet and multi shot, send owl in to tag mobs while you drink and you are farming nicely. Very little downtime.
---
Yep.  Train to zone. Train to guards. Train to grief other players.  GMs would start getting involved if you did it too much.
---
They probably have data on this from vanilla-to-whenever, we know that it's the least popular realm type but to what extent. I don't think they are expecting to have anywhere near the popularity of the original wow launch, although I do think it may surpass retail in a few years. 
---
How many people will play classic wow sustainedly? Blizzard is probably not expecting a lot of people long-term. Rumours that subscriber counts for retail were dipping under 1M are years old, supposedly BFA release only pumped it up to 1.5M, and so I think they are being quite conservative on this and thinking about longevity. 
---
Think about how many people play each realm-type, maybe 50% pve, 40% pvp, 8% rp, 2% rp-pvp? Total guesses, but you can substitute in your own expectations. For every 100K global that's 50K pve, 40K pvp, 8k rp, and 2k rp-pvp for player distribution. Maximum concurrent players per server is 2.5k, how many subscribers does it take to reach capacity per server? Maybe 5,000-20,000 subscriptions depending on what % login daily equals a completely full server. You do also have regional releases, so realm populations will be localized and much smaller than people expect from private servers. 
---
Just some food for thought.
---
That's what I do :)
---
It is bwl level, not naxx lol. Do some research before you start bitching for Pete sake
---
It's weird because I've read the same exact thing. Longer video = more money, but in my experience all my shorter ones are much better. I think if people focus less on achieving a time and instead making a video they themselves like they will have more fun and do better in the long term.
---
You are entirely correct, that is a laughable under eatimate.
---
I mean somone who used Nothing but the basics...
---
Nightfin, mageblood, demonic rune, and major mana pots
---
Will have 15,000  yes that's 15 THOUSAND mana more than someone who doesn't bring consumables over a 5 minute fight.  during progression, most fights are a lot longer than that.
---
add in fellwood farmables, blasted lands farmables, ungoro farmables, weapon oils, potentially flasks and elixirs.
---
People who show up at a non farm raid without consumables barely qualify as half a player at best, and potentially beikg a millstone, soaking up more healer mana than they are worth at worst
---
Minmaxxers would literally spend 30 hours grinding just to a .01 dps increase.
---
The rogue on the ships in wetlands killing all who board.
---
This I can relate to
---
Remember reading quest text to figure out which cardinal direction to travel from the quest giver?
---
I think they changed it when blood began to tank
---
The last time I played was right after Cata released.  I resubbed just this week to see what retail had become.  It's.. different.
---
Reddit in a lot of industries is unblocked because it's a really good "resource" for IT. (and time-waster)
---
Problem is Classic will be the opposite of 2004... 
---
Most of the players will try Classic on release and leave a few days/weeks after, making it so Blizz has to create a lot of servers and  leaving many of them underpopulated
---
It is going to be a huge problem
---
Read the tooltip.
---
&gt;"Silences the target, preventing them from casting spells for 5 seconds."
---
Mine is Tier 0.5 Druid set. Never achieved it in vanilla and it's my end-game goal for Classic. Not planning on raiding because my time is limited, so 0.5 is my ultimate goal.
---
Taunt counts as a spell and cannot be used while silenced.
---
Classic has the potential to be very different from private servers in terms of the average skill and dedication of players.
---
Me too.
---
The one only 1 person per server gets? If so, I hope you're the GM of the top guild on the server, or GM of one of the guilds ringing the bell within 24 hours of it.
---
I can't really wrap my head around it. Is the gist of the post basically that classic items changed stats between patches so they're basically starting the item out with the stats that made the most sense after they balanced them?
---
People get addicted to fresh servers just like people get addicted to making alts. The world feels more populated because everyone is in the same lower level zones. It feels like you have a chance to "compete" to be the first or the best at something.
---
But it is all temporary, and once the feeling wears off people abandon fresh servers and go back to their tried and true, or they just quit the game because they have burned themselves out by playing the same content over and over and over again.
---
That would be a shitshow.  People playing classic strictly for transmog.  Rolling on anything and everything and then quitting classic once they get what they want.
---
Classic is launching with RP realms. They've gotten it into their heads that RP-PvP realms are too niche to support, despite the huge call from people who are some combination of too old to find youth culture funny, desperate to find SOME refuge from real world politics, and too dissociated from former friends to get together for a tabletop gaming session. 
---
As others have pointed out, delaying the rollout of a realmtype on account of "lack of interest" is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Ain't nobody gonna re-roll to the RP-PvP servers if they're unveiled two months after general launch. I'd go so far to say that if they opened RP-PvP realms even one week after general launch it would cut the population of those servers by more than half of what they'd garner if they were in general launch.
---
In case Blizz stays on this path, us dweebs should just designate RP-PvP realms from the list of PvP realms. One for each region. They'll give us a realm list before launch so we can just coordinate through here, twitter, discord, whatever.
---
I loved ret pvp SO much! Absolutely amazing. But then I’d fight a kiting class that kited properly and I wanted to uninstall for having no recourse to this asshole that maintains 11yards of distance. I’d try a net gun out of desperation and end up netting myself. Good times
---
I think you can remove your authenticator from your old phone if you provide irrefutable evidence that you are indeed the owner of the account (ie: government ID or something). 
---
Be careful removing an authenticator though, my buddy had his removed for less than a day while he upgraded his phone and his account was immediately stolen. Some fishy folks out there may already have your login info. You can ask them to temporarily lock your account though while you reapply your authenticator though, if you're worried about this.
---
Yup, one reason why I am playing a healer this time around. I want my guild to raid, and by it being successful I'm ensuring we have a raid slot for a healer filled by myself. I told my buddies to play whatever the hell they want and they'll get a raid slot regardless. Fuck that server first junk.
---
Yeah i think i will 100% find time for all of it but a part of me does wish i could not have to care about school at all like i do now.
---
Dat lv 20 seal of command. I wrote a paper about fattie soc procs in high school... My teacher told be she didn't know what the paper was about... Gave me an a on it anyway because if my enthusiasm.
---
wow that's huge
---
Nothing better than Tip on a pod talking about PvP for that sweet acidic Saturday morning tonic
---
Realistically, get your main tank and healers geared.....outside of that anyone can be whatever the fuck they want. Just do the most DPS you can without grabbing agro.
---
Tyrion and Varian died in such a dumb way just to try to create hype for the expensions
---
My friends want to play Horde, and pvp. So I'll do that with them on a pvp realm. I'll roll my alliance later on the new rp-pvp realm, which will give me a chance to focus on my first horde character.
---
I agree, and this is why down the road when classic wow comes out this will no doubt become a area of discussion.
---
However, there are too many examples too that have shown in the past that such a function can both be good or bad, Path of Exile is heavily based off this. WoW expansion content from TBC and beyond was heavily based off this. Private servers have demo'd peoples drive off this.
---
I feel at least acknowledging such a thing and being prepared for when the time comes would help whatever unexpected things that pop up be handled better.
---
which ones?
---
Yes, actually some people do handicap themselves because they actually like the challenge. It does matter where the difficulty comes from if they're trying to make a change to make it more difficult.
---
I'm /s hocked that this thread turned into a 'plxxXxZ change stUf lyk dis bliZzXZ' post
---
We only have their PR statements. We don't know what they really think, or their real motives. I would bet it's about saving money on GM costs.  They don't want to moderate RP servers.    
---
We know from the top of Activision and Blizzard management all of Blizzard departments have been told to save money.
---
My mistake about not having RP realms. Thanks.
---
Everything post rep farm is really simple if the full guild is behind it.  The major roadblock to the chain is the reputation grind.  You need over 16,000 fragments for neutral rep.  That’s about 40,000 elite bug kills.  You can buy fragments, but they’ll be way too expensive for a guild to bankroll.  Once you get past the rep, it’s just a matter of doing like 8 more hours of solo, sub 5 man chain stuff and getting some raid drops.  Goggles can be a pain, they don’t drop every mc clear.   The biggest issue is doing it with-in the same relative timeframe as others.  The window to ring the gong isn’t long in the grand scheme of things.  You could do all that farm, have trouble getting the crying goggles and be SOL if other players were able to complete.
---
That was the introductory quest for the "interacting with an object in the world" type quests. It was a real stumper. lmfao
---
&gt;Not becoming exalted with the bloodsail Buccaneers.
---
System of a down knows this all too well.  Where are they?   That's right, they've broken up.
---
This isn’t about casters getting worse. This is about creating an authentic experience without sacrificing too much of the core game play. Mages and warlocks sucks until AQ. So does Retri paladins and feral druids. I don’t see people whining about that though. 
---
Even if you gave warlock and mages AQ gear, they still wouldn’t outdps a melee in pre-bis in MC and BWL. So who cares? If you have to be 30% behind the melee instead of 20% in exchange for creating longevity for the game, then so be it. 
---
I’m sorry about the defense cap. I forgot that private servers were using values from affer that patch and not prior. 
---
You’re right. Molten Core is easy. I think retail is easy too. But you know what? Some people don’t think that. Does it mean we should make it even easier though? No, it doesn’t. That’s what happened to retail. 
---
As for the dungeon gear being 50% BiS until AQ40 was an overstatement to get a point across. I will take that back. The point with this was however that 1.12 stats means that rare items becomes more powerful and thus, chances are that once AQ40 releases, you’ll be wearing more blues than you’d otherwise have done if the stats had not been 1.12. It’s no secret though that some of those items are BiS until AQ40 and on average I’d say it’s around 3-4 slots pr class. That’s hell of a lot more than 1 or zero. 
---
You’re talking about PvP as if you know how long the phases are going to last.  I don’t expect phase 3 to begin 2 months after phase 2 begun. I - and many others, who are interested in playing competitively - expects this to be 5-6 months. Anything short of that means that the game doesn’t expect to exists for more than a year and a half.  Any hardcore guild will be dominating WPvP until phase 3. It takes 14 weeks to hit R14. Even if only as few as 2 people could be in Bracket 1, you’d be looking at 20 rank 14s by the time Phase 3 starts. That’s a problem. 
---
You also talk about wbuffs being oh so difficult to get now. Hardcore guilds are going to plan around it. Don’t worry. You don’t have to pop your precious head 10 minutes before raid start. You could do it 2 days before if you wanted too and make sure you got the buff. Hardcore guilds are even doing split raids. The only problem is WCB.  But even that will be timed and arranged around. Wbuffs and consumables are still gonna be a thing - and cooldowns aren’t going to change that, only make it more frustrating. So yes, the determining factor will still be the amount of rank 14s as long as the gear is this stupidly overpowered.
---
As far as getting a bunch of new items when a phase hits, you’re forgetting that when BWL hits and when ZG hits, more of the items that comes with those raids could have been useful if it wasn’t for the 1.12 change. More oppourtunities is better - not worse. 
---
The fact that you keep acting arrogant about some of the statements really goes to show how little you care about the community, and how much you care about you. Epic items felt epic in classic. It’s a point being brought up countless of times during the years. 1.12 stats will make a lot more epics obsolete and a lot more rares viable. That’s not making epics more epic. That’s making rares act as an epic.  The days of inspecting someone with full epic gear and be in awe will be much harder to accomplish with this change. Just because some epic items are already obsolete doesn’t mean we should be adding more to the table. 
---
But you’re right. I’m sure that players are going to keep raiding every week when they know only a few items are viable and you need to share them among 20+ players granted they do drop. Sure bro. Casual players are better off getting an epic every 8th raid instead of every 4th. They’re gonna love it! That’s why retail has become a game where you get upgrades every 40th raid and not by just logging in. That was just Blizzards idea.  Oh wait...
---
You’re right about dungeons though. Dungeons are probably still going to get run by a few people. But if PI became a thing, you would have seen more being ran. And that’s good. Not bad.
---
Very very bad post
---
There it is; thank you. I knew I wasn’t trippin.
---
It works the same as it does at any other point in vanilla except there are no bgs. Look up a guide on how the ranking system works if you want to understand it. Staysafe made a good video explaining it. 
---
The tldr of your question is that the fastest anyone can possibly get rank 14 is 3 months but it will take most that go for it much longer than that if they ever even manage to get it.
---
Some of his points were hyperbolic but he’s right about not getting better gear in some slots for over a year not being fun. It straight up isn’t.
---
“Can we do MC with 25? Hmm...let’s try it.”
---
New servers in vanilla gave the option for free transfers when they opened to help pad population.
---
Would they not still do this due to classic being "classic infinite", its still a low drop rate, but at some point there will just be thunderfuries laying around everywhere, vanilla raids, especially with world buffs, which they should not remove because that would be big changes, are not difficult. I think if people actually play classic for mechanically hard raids they are in for a suprise. It won't really get near the difficulty of doing retail mythic raids or other more recent MMOs raids (atleast pre nerf versions, mostly thinking of FF14 here). However buffing the bosses HP/Damage/armor, this tuning you advocate for, will only slow down boss kills, you just force tanks to wear full mitigation and make people sit around and wait until tank has to take twice as long to build threat. If you have any other idea of tuning that isn't "changing the game" do tell, but just making bosses bigger will just hurt mana classes and hybrids more than anything, and the only goal you achieve is change the game for tanks, well mainly healers if bosses start swinging for 80% tank hp, but DPS players which are majority in raid won't really notice a difference, except the game just became even slower
---
Holy fucking shit
---
Do you realize that were going to be going into molten core doing relatively 50% more dps than we would have done had everything been progressive?
---
Why do you people want raids that are post nerf of the boss, post buff from specs, post buff from items and straight up going to be easier becasue everyone will be better
---
No, you don't get me at all. You and I want to play Vanilla as it was and then there are people who want to play Wotlk as it was. If you deny those people and defend Classic to be as close to the original as possible even with its negatives it makes you a hypocrite. 
---
It is obvious Classic could be better but people want to play the old game. Same goes for many with Wotlk and Tbc.
---
I had a friend in Vanilla wow that worked himself silly to get rank 14 gear.  He was sinking an insane number of hours into the game every day.  Quit the game 3 days after he got it from burn out. I pity the people who farm that shit.
---
The RP designation is mostly to cut down on dank memes, politics spam, nonsense in /world, ridiculous alt-coded names, and assorted other assholery. It's so you can just be in the World of Warcraft. RP, like autism, is a vast spectrum and encompasses everything from "I don't want to talk about your goddamn fantasy football team while we're casting frost spells at a summoned elemental lord" to "LOK'TAR friend! Thrall requires heroes of the Horde to delve deep into Blackrock Mountain and foil the Dark Irons' attempts to bring forth Ragnaros, the Firelord!"  
---
There's a lot more to it of course, but the gist of it is things like repeating sick catchphrases and pushing MAGA/Hilldawg/YangGang/BidenBuddies/Brexit/Remainzit/BLM/ALM/LGBTQ/etc.etc.etc IS NOT WELCOME. Keep your bullshit and hangups out there in the real world.
---
Accept pvp as it is or roll on a pve realm
---
would it be nice to also see a visual representation?
---
2 guild colors above someone head. Normal Green would be experienced player or mix and a Yellow Guild name would suggest, it's a guild meant for new players who has no experience with vanilla. Then those yellows guilds will have their own casuals, semi hardcore, progression guilds. 
---
Not everyone advertise also, or has world chat on
---
Reminder that Paladins are inherently an alliance class and the lore gymnastics they did to have Belves be Paladin are sacrilegious (but I suppose same apply for the forsaken being able to use Holy spells). 
---
The class divide gave the game flavor and texture. The game suffered when it was homogenized. *In my opinion.* 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Merge it with what, and RP-PvE server or a standard PvP server?
---
Only because of Serj though. He wanted to make music just to make music. Once they got too famous he just sort of noped out. The rest of System have expressed wanting to continue making music, but Serj has always said no.
---
And as much as I love System's music it won't be the same if they got back together and made new music.
---
Yep.  vanilla is....  pure freedom...  totally un-normalized.
---
A player with the right build, and good mechanics, 90% pre-raid bis gear, proper gear enhancements, ie armor kits/spell threads/enchants won't do better than a casual... they will entirely eclips them.  
---
Add in full on try harding consumables  and it's absolutely humiliating.
---
This is what Classic does so well, it introduces the new player slowly and never overwhelms them. Worth these new MMOs I feel so overwhelmed in the first 5 minutes of the game that I seriously don’t feel like playing after that.
---
really cool helmets had a unique model (were ruined) on Trolls like in the image. I guess its so their tusks wouldnt be clipping through even though the long eared races and Tauren horns still clip through.
---
Yea, I accidentally threw it to a "friend" and he claims it never landed in his inventory... yea he has a fucking ghost following him when we takes SS
---
I dont think this idea is news to anyone, or will take anyone by surprise in the future.
---
I made a post when I arrived on the reddit asking if this was a new idea or if it has been discussed ad-nauseam.  The latter was true.
---
People are just excited for the game and theres nothing to do but circle up and gaze lovingly at the bro next to you.  And yes, I am party to the jerk as well.
---
Its exhausting enough just waiting for the release and I dont think many people are interested in going down the hypothetical road on something as large and far-off as this.
---
The content release could take 18 months before it's clear and top guilds have it on farm.  It could (easily) be another two before casual guilds do something similar.  And then when do they get bored after that?
---
Should we really dive into something that could be more than 4 years in the future?  I wouldn't put too much energy into this, although Im of a mind that the idea of it is exciting.
---
If there is demand for it in the future you bet your ass the classic community won't be shy about letting everyone know.
---
It's pretty obvious everyone allude to Tribute solo here mostly, but if you remove dungeon farming you just push everyone into playing mage instead of hunter for their aoe farming. Sure, you are out in the open world instead of an enclosed area, but if its blizzlike pop there will be time and places to aoe farm. but even doing 3 instances per hour wouldn't change a ton in the tribute farming because a run early on atleast, takes like 12-15min to complete playing it safe. Costs quite a bit of time running out if theres no logout macro that will port you to entrence (doesn't work on retail, so I kinda assume it won't work on classic)
---
I'm glad they're trying to keep the hype up, but reading the post word for word honestly made me want to stop watching.
---
Spend 30 seconds on a brief summary, then discuss what your opinion on it is and why you like/dislike something.
---
I wasn't warned about this movie's ending beforehand, and it hit like a truck. I watched it with my exgirlfriend when we were clearly drifting apart from each other but I was still in denial so it hit even harder at the time.
---
Nice meme though
---
Survival is a very strong pvp spec, not a meme at all
---
Love your vids by the way bro :) interesting find. I do agree with you, i made a few a while ago, and found that all of my better rated videos were ones were i actually were into making, instesd of stuffing it full of content stricktly for time
---
Illumination+Holy Power (i.e. when you finally respec to Holy at 55+) on a Paladin. You’re a god in the making. 🤲🏻✨
---
It comes from difficulties, and people who say if I clear it on LFR/Normal I've seen the fight, even if they havn't seen mythic phases, mythic only mechanics and stuff, basically the hard stuff for the people who wants an extra challenge instead of having one mechanic per boss
---
Amen x2.  I sure as fuck dont have the time for that.  More power to anyone who wants to 'big dick' from day 1 of HKs.
---
A reminder to OP that we're talking about the top 0.1% for highest honor per week.  That's 1 in 1000.  What is population cap going to be?  Do the math and figure out how many people it could be using this gear.
---
And once they have rank 14 gear you can be sure as shit they wont want to set foot in the battlegrounds ever again.
---
Serenity Now Funeral Raid
---
I can think off Padre's Trousers in DM West being very good until AQ I think, but I don't remember any blue being best all the way into naxx, Hand of Justice perhaps but it never had a change iirc
---
We don’t know yet.
---
I personally think trolls already look super cool without helms, I always hide helms on them
---
I don't think it's an unpopular opinion. Blizzard obviously agrees with you. It seems only the 10:01 video private server heroes are that concerned about it.
---
Fucking right lol
---
whoops...I was thinking of my neighbors dog for some reason :D
---
No. There are 2 modes. War mode on and war mode off. War mode off is the old PvE servers, stepping into enemy territory like Orgrimmar as Alliance will still flag you for PvP, make you targetable by enemies, and give you the 5 minute PvP flag once you leave combat. War mode on is the old PvP servers, where PvP is always enabled and enemy players can target you anywhere. The reason this was implemented is some of the largest realms have MASSIVE faction imbalance such as Kel'Thuzad and Sargeras being nearly 90% Alliance and Mal'Ganis and Illidan being close to 95% Horde. Those were the 4 largest US PvP realms prior to the implementation of the war mode system.
---
I know you are embracing the meme of it, but if you actually wanted to be effective without being primarily ranged just go BM and melee people.  You pet will do more damage then you, but I don't think that breaks the immersion of being rexxar.  He is a beastmaster in wc3, not a survivalist.  
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cVV0zggRpZ0Em0oh
---
Use the pet and intim as your closer, beastial wrath is your main damage dealer then frosttrap for entrapment against melee turtle with deterrence, monkey, and base parry while hopefully your pet eats them alive.
---
It’s like the plague though. One turns purple and they all start to turn with them.....
---
There aren't pvp servers or pve servers now. All live servers are both pvp, or pve. How you flag your own character will be which version you play in. If you want to stay pve forever, go for it. No matter which server you are on.
---
You speak though as if AOE farming mobs (in dungeons or not) or soloing instances is the only/best way of making money. Mining, herbing, playing the AH, tanks/heals selling runs, etc. I don't think those aforementioned things blow everything else out of the water.
---
There is a difference with looking up a bis list and feeling like you HAVE to look up every single item you find incase it gets buffed down the line
---
You're a God
---
Armor by this point is fairly correct, or atleast tuned around Maexxna's armor (3731), however as you point out elsewhere, if there is hidden mitigation or such is obviously unknown, but armor formula and armor amount is pretty well known at this point
---
Okay that’s awesome! But dat release date tho?
---
Once BWL is out you also have access to worldbuffs, previous "guildbreakers" like Vaelastrasz becomes a lot easier with the use of DM Tribute+Songflower and Blasted lands buff (all which are gatherable and without a big cooldown, like dragon slaying supposedly has)
---
If you had large tusks on your troll and wore specific full-face mail and plate helmets, the helmet would only cover the sides and back of your character’s head and therefore, result in the incredibly dorky picture; in my opinion.
---
Best raid leader I ever had was a hunter. He was able to pull agro and dump them onto the offtanks. Then he’d go back to auto shot and keep leading the raid.
---
the logic is that back in the day u weren’t clearing BWL with a 1.12 BRE. So it’s not the ‘true’ experience. But I mean we have 16 debuffs, 1.12 talents and 1.12 items so the content is going to be wayy easier now anyway
---
Yeah, leads me to think it was really early like 1.1 or 1.2 when their patch notes were a bit more dodgy.
---
&gt;nobody knew that items would change.
---
That is not an upolular opinion, it's simply true.  
---
But alas, there is no way to erase the memory of 4 Million players, and burn down tens of Terabytes worth of databases on webservers all over the globe. The downside of complete recreation: We already know what will be happening.
---
&gt;Did we do THAT during Vanilla? 
---
As a matter of fact, many people did. Plnning for the future, and being aware that things may change have always been things the hardcore and semi-hardcore players were doing. Same as the more casual players do not rely on such planning, even if they have access to the info. Bottom line, I wouldn't worry about it.
---
&gt;We all know that pro players will steamroll raids in greens anyway,
---
And fuck over all the non hardcore players in the process? No thank you.  
---
The moment you tailor exclusively to the needs of the minority, things go wrong.
---
The raids will be difficult enough for the majority. The logistics of getting 40 to organise alone is a challenge in itself.
---
Assuming Faerie Fire, Curse of Recklessness and Sunder stacks (faerie+sunder does atleast) and add annihilator to the mix (supposedly stacks based on old comments) even naxx boss armor reaches 0, BRE on Bosses in that case has no effect.
---
I too hate being so cool that I come to a subreddit for world of Warcraft to cringe at people talking about world of Warcraft
---
Paladins can get Consecration at level 20 and use it to easily tank dungeons on their way up to 60. I recommend this if you want to run a lot of dungeons because tanks are in demand. You will find groups much more easily as a tanking Paladin than any other type of Paladin. (That changes at level 60.) I would still keep a set of healing gear on me in case I ever need it.
---
Warriors don't shine until they're geared up at max level.
---
Yeah and I never argued that
---
I agree. But I wish they had the option to look cool with the helmets too.
---
Sometimes you'll run out of quests and have to grind a bit.  Sometimes you'll think you've run out of quests and grind a bit. 
---
Leveling is arguably the best part of the game.  I was in high school when wow was released and I would level to 60 and almost immediately reroll. 
---
For someone like me, leveling was the entire game.  Start with some friends or make some along the way and you'll have the time of your life whether it's a steady stream of rerolling to find the right character fit, or gunning for some great end-game content.
---
I was a MT in Classic and became a main healer in TBC. I’d say they are both equally as fun with the tank having an edge. 
---
I plan on rolling a resto shammy, so I plan on healing again.
---
Problem with just tuning up HP and damage is you just make mana classes worse, mainly mages and warlocks because healers would just have to prioritize their mana for tanks and less to warlocks life tapping, and hybrids (lol hybrid) would fall even further down in the "DPS Viability list" Dominating early classes like Warrior and Rogue don't really care because their resources are infinite, I concede Warrior might have to stop hitting maybe due to waiting for tank to build threat in absolute full hp/mitigation gear
---
What's sharing
---
You'd think reddit would be one of the first sites they block
---
Great contribution
---
People want to play exactly what they played many years ago, make it as authentic as possible, which in that case, why even bring it when you're going to change things that made it so memorable back then  
---
They have a hard job to do honestly, i wouldnt want that on my back
---
I played non-stop and I think only got to rank 8 back in the day. I’m not worried about this at all.
---
Hopefully it wont be possible for someone makes a battle tag auto grouper like oqueue
---
What always disterubed me about that scene, is the male-plastic blowup-doll tucked away behind the boxes in the upper right corner of the shot.
---
Yup there’s a new post here just about every day from someone stressed out by the thought of playing on the same server as a streamer because they think that means a raid group of people will constantly be stealing all of their tags. 
---
Seriously it won’t be an issue. Unless you’re on the same server as asmongold or some other huge streamer you’ll almost never have a problem, and even then the problem would be queue times.
---
To be fair, a big population doensn't necessary mean people on that server like PVP.
---
Frostmourne is the largest OCE PVP server but most people I know only rolled on it because it was the most populated. Maybe the original occupants loved PVP but as time goes on, the 'popular' server name spread and non-PVPers moved over just to get the population benefits. 
---
It also helped that it was the heaviest OCE alliance server so even if you were in PVP mode, there was so little horde that it didn't matter.
---
The horde alternative OCE server was Barthilas.
---
This is great advice! There's a big difference between analyzing bis lists and investing yourself in the lore. If there's enough free time available, pick up the warcraft rts games and play through them before starting Classic. I think Blizzard has them available in a bundle right now too.
---
Idk at this point I feel like youtubers have become pretty much door to door salesmen in a way and the constant barrage of people trying to force feed you their shit is super annoying.    No solicitors, you know what I mean
---
Ahh yes, I was thinking about this as well. My only doubt about this was that I feel like my pet could be easily cc'ed while I can use consumables etc. as extra things to free myself. Orcs also have the stun racial which makes me even harder to cc compared to my pet. Do you think this will be the case?
---
Can I find a job that doesn’t make me wanna neck myself send help
---
So you mean you're going to play on a different server than them? Or you are going to tune in to their stream just to know where they're leveling so that you can avoid that area?
---
Before clickable objects were shiny. What a time to be alive. Wake me up on release!
---
Yes, but to melee instead of shoot is the meme aspect of it to most. I feel like survival is focussed mostly on creating a distance between you and the target.
---
That streamar wont get anything done if he has 50 People following him. You think they all obey and want him to succeed? They will steal mobs mc,cc and just be destructive. 
---
And If he is trying to wpvp, fun sharing that honor. Also group 5 rogues and he will still fall if someone wants to gank him.
---
I think you are worrying to much about this.
---
RP PVP server will be DEAD ON ARRIVAL if they dont release it at launch. are they retarded?
---
At least for US Emerald Dream its long been a pretty active PvP server (bfa/war mode notwithstanding).  Do kind of agree with you but that same argument could be made of all PvP servers imo.  Also for a lot of people its not because they want to constantly PvP, rather that its at least possible so the threat of it is always there
---
&gt; seems only the 10:01 video private server heroes are that concerned about it.
---
Haha yea, gotta reach that 10:00 video length to get three video ads for more revenue, while ranting about topics to get views!
---
Another unpopular opinion, a true classic experience is 100% impossible if somebody has any experience with World of Warcraft. You are going into the game with knowledge you did not have when you went into the game the first time.
---
You don't have to stockpile those items you are talking about. You can choose not to do that.
---
Yes she was very insightful
---
I'm not saying anything against you, but in this sub specifically I see a lot of posts about how RAIDING isn't the only end game etc, but what else is there to do once you hit 60, its either raid or rank14 if you want gear improvement, it's weird how pronounced both sides are, but a middle ground is incredibly difficult to accept
---
I agree but it’s just two slots.
---
As for difficulty, the content is already figured out and the only way to make it challenging is to buff boss health and damage output.
---
We did wait over a decade to get Classic. Just let the people have it as it was for a little while. The OSRS way of voting for the future of the game sounds good to me though. 
---
I do also think that balancing in Vanilla was done with the correct idea in mind. It should be Class indentity &gt; End game performance.
---
I don't trust Blizzard to do it though. Vanilla had 12 patches Classic will have 6. Items were rebalanced many times during Vanilla they wont be at all in Classic. If Blizzard was a surgeon they would be opperating with a Chainsaw. We the players are much better at changing things a tiny bit.
---
You’re gonna die a lot.
---
 ”progressive itemization”  is only a thing while it is progressing.  Once it has stabilized, it is no longer a thing.  So you are concerned with something only in the beginning of the life of a classic server.
---
Would this choice of design negatively affect YOUR gameplay in a negative aspect during this window of play?
---
\&gt;  And always alt-tabbing and looking up EVERY item that drops, on ”item patch changes list dawt com”, and deciding ”ok this item becomes good in five months, I’ll keep it”. That would be HORRIBLE and not WoW-like at all! 
---
Aren't these items mostly BOP? so doesn't that make it even less of an issue?
---
IT people are under the same filters, they dont want ot take away their own entertainment
---
Blizzard: we are adding one small change of including realm transfers for a nominal fee
---
You don't actually need to respec though. You just need to collect more than one set of gear. All it really costs is bag space.
---
Depends on what day its released and how you count weeks, but the traditional "wow week" wednesday-wednesday (or tues-tues or thurs-thurs, whichever region you are from) changes a whole lot, like if the game is released on a monday, first week is bascically the week following that. No one would imply you would level on mon+tues and raid before wed reset then
---
that's a really good point hahaha
---
emphasis on need
---
I’m gonna be min/maxing pretty heavily for leveling but if I could wipe my memories and go in blind I’d do it in a heartbeat.
---
It's also inevitable a true that starting over every time leads to increased burnout, more you do something bless it triggers the happy fun chemicals in the brain, it's inevitable fact of biology. Private server developers and administrators know this, and they know people will keep coming back for vanilla in private server communities, because it's like a drug.
---
They have fully embraced the fresh hype dead shitshow that was rampant in the private server community, and which will not exist in blizzard classic.
---
Mages can AOE farm silithus air elementals (assuming they are spawned with classic from the getgo even if silithus has no quests), with improved dampen magic I think mages take like 1 damage per attack or something from them, making them able to just aoe farm them while they level for free rep
---
Iam not a mod, just a lurker. It's up to you.
---
Prot War.
---
I love listening to any kind of classic wow discussion, so I love the long videos where they break every detail down. Sorry Mr content policeman but some people like different things. Imagine thinking people are making good money from these videos lol... it’s next to nothing whether it’s 5 or 20mins
---
Fascinating way of looking at it. I actually agree! Min-maxing people who crush and rush all content and then whine aren’t right, and have only themselves to blame. They are the exceptiom. Most people will have fun and will struggle even with the 1.12 talents and 16 debuff slots!
---
Nobody uses a 30 yard silence to stop a warrior from charging. You are confusing it with mage’s CS.
---
Why would you use rank 1 instead of max rank? Bizarre.
---
A blizzard operated pserver sounds sweet. What are you even doing here?
---
This is something I have thought about a lot as well, bigger hp and damage would further restrict hybrids, mana users and would just introduce more wait time on bosses while tanks play full itemization no threat gear, its "easier" to do this kind of tuning in later expansions because you introduce things like Misdirect or Tricks of the Trade that helps the tank keep aggro (yes yes I know threat was made easier to produce in tbc and wotlk and further into the game)
---
A well built raid group will have 10-12 warriors and 2 hunters. That’s moronic.
---
You understand that when these servers launch almost every quest zone is gonna be crowded as fuck?
---
I leveled resto shaman many times.
---
It’s not as bad as people make it sound. I 5 man as much as possible
---
Spirit on early, unfixed warrior gear made it memorable? I guess so, but for the wrong reasons.
---
Reproducing the earliest, bad item values and fixing them over time would just turn off players. Do you really want to alt-tab and look at a website to see how every dropped item will change over time, to decide if you will roll Need or Pass? That was never how we player Vanilla. And THAT would be a HUGE, bad change. ;-)
---
This is depressing for me as a shaman player if it means there won’t be the level 58 pvp gear. The 58 boots are much better for elemental than the 60 pvp boots.
---
Isn't there quite a lot of those powerful items? Imagine getting Ironfoe first BRD, or talisman of ephermal power, azuresong, perdition blade, sure none of them are maybe at peak of power like BRE, but isn't that kinda whats fun? Even knowing that weapon gets buffed later people would be fucking nuts over it even if it was 1.4 version or whatever just to stash it until its good
---
Guards protect towns, other than that you're on your own.
---
Is it Mankirk or Mankrik?
---
- Alliance player who has never done that quest
---
My point exactly.
---
Plus, if I may weigh in from my perspective as a programmer, it does make a LOT of sense from technical PoV, to set the game to a fixed point in the patch cycle and have all items, spells etc. there.
---
People advocating for classic repeating the patch cycle, tend to forget that the purpose of patches is not to change the game, **but to fix it.** When I am patching in something that doesn't give more content, and instead only concerns content that is already there, I am doing it because I realized I made some mistake, and want to fix it. The items were never meant to be in their 1.6 or 1.whatever state, same as the classes.
---
This goes to all the people out there whining about no-patch:  
---
You are advocating for cars without seatbelts or collapsable zones, because that was how it was before, and that somehow sitting in a vehicle that actively threatens your life is a good thing.
---
And also like the terminator, all fights will you be chasing someone for a solid hour and getting no where closer to finishing the fight.
---
But I’m saying that they are just watching people get smashed in towns and doing nothing. Im wondering if people remember the guards being a little bit more active in vanilla.
---
That doesn't change that people have established characters, friends, and guilds before new servers open
---
\[TFW you realize you've been pronouncing Mankrik in your hear wrong for 15 years\]([https://imgur.com/gallery/WrKPhfd](https://imgur.com/gallery/WrKPhfd))
---
No disagreeing.  I'm just picking my battles, and this seems like the lesser of two evils.
---
Is that... Jeff Kaplan? 🤨
---
It won’t be a toggle in Classic. So your point is moot.
---
It sounds like they're keeping the 1.12 shield block in game, which is going to trivialize a lot of content. :(
---
I think source is Tim &amp; Eric
---
”Where is Mankrik’s wife?” ”Look at your 2019 QuestHelper.” Yep the original experience is never coming back. Back when even Thottbott lacked info! The good old days.
---
You do make an interesting point about ”then don’t look up how items will change, and just play the game in the moment”. Sure. But on the other hand, everyone who DOES look up the change-lists would ”know the future” which isn’t WoW-like either.
---
So there’s no way to reproduce the original experience. But the least confusing solution is to use 1.12 item values, so that items don’t morph over time (which would require external websites to keep track of, and take you out of the game immersion).
---
I mean I hate most of where modern retail went, but it was a good change. You get bonus experience, rewards and talents for having pvp mode on which encourages everyone to fight but you can turn it off if you want. I've let my sub lapse because pretty much everything else they implemented is a disappointment and they are insisting on ignoring the players and not fixing anything, but the first couple of months of BFA had more world pvp in it than the previous decade combined.
---
If you like keeping up with the shit ton of information required to support people, go paladin and revel in your massive utilitarian epeen while still killing shit. For the most part.
---
If you get boners from watching people burn to death, go warlock and enjoy the sheer hatred you create every time you press the fear button.
---
Are they relevant now?
---
Video game difficulty hasnt skyrocketed at all. The pandering to casuals is what has really skyrocketed, at the cost of challenging/punishing content. Old school games did not guarantee completion.
---
The best
---
To be honest, I'm glad. I'm part of the community that is in favor of facelifts where the game needs it and it makes sense, and I think it's a far better play experience. The gearing process was already a pain in the dick without having to worry about keeping a piece in the bank because it would upgrade overnight from shit tier to BiS. These are the type of changes I applaude. I don't think it's difficult at all to put yourself in the mindset of developers from that time and update it in ways that make sense. Old School RuneScape largely did that, and I'd argue quite well.
---
I'd be perfectly content seeing some specs tweaked and bugs fixed from the original to make a better Vanilla experience. You can make Ret viable without, ya know, giving out mounts at level 20 or reducing the leveling time frame by 40%.
---
Too real my dude.
---
Until you see the warrior you just snared get that subtle orange wreath of "Fuck your slows I don't care" pop up at his feet.
---
They are, they continuously spawn as long as the enemy faction is attracting them by agitating NPCs or players in the town. Even when you're 60 a bunch of constantly spawning level 35 guards will fuck you up
---
its not how its supposed to work but people are basing shit off the kurthalos lists
---
Yeah I'd like to, haven't decided which to do yet though. Maybe Thunderbluff, maybe the inside of black rock mountain with the chains and lava
---
This.
---
So? Both hunters and warriors have a place in an ideal raid, and due to the law of supply and demand the overall ratio of warriors and hunters trying to raid should be pretty close if not identical to the ratio of warriors to hunters in a raid comp.
---
Sounds like a hunter thing to do.
---
Yes. But it's too old . I can only read reddit/.compact
---
Apparently I gave them my phone number at some point because I was able to have a code texted to me to get logged in. So that's cool. 
---
Don't know what I'm gonna do though. I have zero interest in playing anything except Classic lol
---
If you've watched one, you've watched them all.
---
Oh okay I see
---
Blind is totally the way to go. There's so much stuff to see and interact with in the game that trying to rush through it by following guides just mutes it.
---
It's like reading cliff notes instead of the full novel.
---
Interesting perspective! Thanks for sharing :-) maybe I'll check retail out one day - I haven't played the game since Cata
---
Anyone who worships twitch streamers need to get outside and socialize.
---
And yet, it seems that I am prophetic.
---

---
Guards are gnarly and if you know how to make them work for you you can bait the enemy faction into some hefty repair bills
---
Of course, they might work slightly different in Classic than vanilla
---
What exactly sounds sweet about it, you could've played on a dozen pservers by now if that's what you wanted.
---
I guess I was a couple days too early XD
---
I'm really not sure how i would approach this, but thats just how i see it. I definitely agree on what you said for the most part tho. I'm just going sit back and see how it turns out in the end, if for the better or worse.
---
Being a nice, competent dude. Just like last time.
---
Hehe, very true. It must be a nightmare and an insult to be asked to return code to its early, buggy/unfinished state to please people who are so whiney that nothing can ever please them anyway.
---
I saw a funny comment today; ”I have autism, and even I think that the No Changes REEEE crowd can be fucking autistic.”
---
That's about half my plans for classic ruined if there's no RP-PvP realm. I was SO stoked that I knew what I wanted this time around instead of just having to join the server all my r/l friends are on.
---
Warrior is slow and painful if you don't have some utility from cooking, engi, and tailoring but it isn't AS bad as people think it is. Sure it isn't as fast as other classes but you'll be able to efficiently kill things hamstring kiting once you've got the hang of it. 
---
Engi bombs and trinkets are a blessing for warriors mid to late game.
---
I'd rather their rewards mean something tbqh.
---
That is again a thing in small scale fights, but if there are Shamans or Priests around these buffs don't last for long.
---
Classicwow yes! There is no better time. Stay away from retail
---
Sure but the retail servers can't even handle 40 v 40 in a battleground.
---
https://youtu.be/iz1_DLm3mCk
---
I am scared that blizzard is gonna rely on current server tech and it being a complete unplayable experience.
---
Just open one rppvp server. That's lean enough...
---
&gt;Imagine trying to get quests done, and some guy with 50 followers comes in killing everything.
---
Sounds like an amusing experience.
---
Esfand Im between Hunter and Holy pala. I like healing but Im going to play solo a lot because of my work times. Can you Hook me up a build good enough for healing pve and pvp, and where i can quest and farm a little ok?
---
So you're voicing an opinion on something you haven't watched, got it.
---
I think buffed servers would be a good idea. Some people never hit 60 and raided, some people won't have time for a buffed game this time around. I personally never enjoyed following a strategy guide for any game and would like to enjoy Classic the same way. I don't mind playing it at the same old difficulty level.
---
But in the case of meme specs versus premium specs you are looking at a musket versus a heavy machine gun. 
---
Or as I like to say,  "It's not the size of the boat but the motion in the ocean that counts. However it takes a long time to get to England in a row boat."
---
Yeah,  brother and I may have had a system. 
---
He cuts out all the cards from as many as he can get and I pick them up where he drops them at.
---
Never come in together and we don't look alike lol. 
---
Not proud,  but not ashamed
---
Cheers, I can see it from your perspective. Thanks for the discussion. See you in Classic!
---
Okay but what happens after naxx though? there's no more content
---
I guess this is a point. I'm still a bit disappointed because this will still make entry level content easier than it needs to be. And this game needs to keep people invested long enough to get to BWL patch and AQ patch. If people are full clearing MC after two months it won't be great.
---
Some will just choose the same server name they rolled on Vanilla (if available).
---
fuck sharding
---
Once they start getting their raid epics and BiS blues warriors are pretty much at the top.
---
I love it!
---
Seeing them mention TBC scares the shit out of me though.
---
Beastial wrath says, the pet cannot be stopped unless killed, this means that it is immune to CCs during the CD.  So you are far more likely to be the target then he is.  If people do CC your pet between the CD you can move some points around and get 2 pts into imp mend pet and use it to dispel off most CCs.   
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/BTMB_3pAAAM68BM
---
Both of BM and melee survival are sub-optimal, but the comparison in effectiveness is heavily in favor of BM.    
---
Melee survival dual-wield hunter will do damage on par with a healer, with bad mobility to catch people, sub-par defenses against other melee, and no self healing like feral/ret/enhance could use to even the odds.  Enemy hunters, mages, warlocks, spriests would kill you before you ever got into melee.  Enemy rogues, warriors, melee etc are going to triple your damage output in melee and melt you.  You would only ever hope to kill steal or perhaps in a zerg get ignored long enough to get kills.  
---
BM is not a meta end-game spec because IIRC it doesn't scale very well because the pet doesn't get stats off of you, but I do remember that early after the hunter patch happened and it first came out I could full CC lockout a BM hunter as a dps and if I didn't get a heal or have a defensive CD the pet could just kill me during BW.  All of your damage is in a small window, and you don't have great control(only that one intim), so you'll never kill a good healer or someone who uses their CDs, but BM can just 1button-win against low HP targets and/or bad players.
---
Ah, thank you for elaborating. I understand you now. I think I can get on board with this.
---
Warriors too
---
It seems the main worry is that 16 debuff slots, final talent trees, and slightly more optimized item stats will make raid content easier.
---
It probably will. So why not buff raid boss HP and damage output by 10% each? That should compensate nicely?
---
This is my opinion on the matters you listed
---
Talents and boss nerfs are bigger hurdles than old stat gear gear, almost all gear that was buffed was caster gear, so why not just bring more melee and less of casters, there is not really a shortage in warrior and rogue players in general
---
Quickly Going through Items looking at Phase 5 (AQ) I find few pvp items (Hunter PvP Gloves, Mage PVP Boots+Shoulders and Feral not being raid only items (Feral itemization is basically only dungeons because they have some fucked up itemization, i'm also excluding rank 14 stuff here) if I go further back to stage 4 (Nightmare Dragons + ZG) Its mostly the same except Hunters will use Cape of Black Baron/Cloak of Shrouded mists (Ragnaros cloak), Healer classes are still using Robes of the Exalted, melee dps still use Hand of Justice/Blackhands Breath, Holy pala uses DM North green healing bracers maybe? I wonder how your point about for Half of BiS gear is in dungeons holds up, it basically only applies to molten core?
---
Fastest Speedruns are decided by combination of buff stacking, coordination skill and loot, isn't that exactly what it should be? Rank 14 doesnt just grow on a tree, it still takes roughly 12 weeks to reach from scratch assuming you keep high standing (unless i'm wrong)
---
I somewhat agree with you on this point, but they would have to implement an extended tooltip or something that indicates this item will recieve changes in the future cycles, because else you will just make people feel like they will have to look up every item before they get rid of them incase it gets buffed, that is not good game design in any shape or form.
---
Epic items will feel just as epic as they always did during classic, A very large part of MC epics was never great to begin with. Warriors knowing how strong BRE is, or would become  would just not get excited about other 2hander drops in MC or BWL.
---
There is always an incentive to run old raids, Molten Core for Bindings/Band of Accuria/BRE - BWL for Elementium, Neltharion's Tear, Rejuvenation Gem, Drakefang Talisman etc, you get the gist of it.
---
Dungeons becoming obsolete is an unavoidable thing, How is it a valid reason that having gear change stats makes you re-run dungeons when you are already raid geared, you will just mega stomp the dungeon for just one item over and over until it appears, should we also make scarlet monastery relevant at 60 because that dungeon becomes obsolete for anyone who reaches 60? 
---
I'd be happy if you can correct any mistakes you find here, I really would, because I want to understand all sides of these type of arguments
---
I mean... it's honestly pretty garbage. Might as well check it out when you sub for classic since it comes free, but they actively hate choice at the moment. There were some good bits, MoP had all kinds of cool shit like warlock tank form and druid symbiosis letting them get abilities and give abilities like getting divine shield from paladins and giving them wrath or getting frost nova from mages and giving them healing touch. It wasn't anything like vanilla, but it was certainly its own thing and fun as hell - but these days it's the worst of both worlds, they've pruned every class into the exact same build and spend mold and they immediately gut any playstyle that pops up that they didn't intend.
---
I never did get this meme about Mankirk's Wife. I found her by accident on my first char while running down the gold road for the apothecary delivery to TB quest.
---
Well when gear comes, maybe a few items from raid and pre-bis, you can do mara farm. Use gathering proffesions.  
---
You can bring a healer and 2man DM:E jump runs or DM:E aoe packs. Devilsaur. Sell Tanking runs.   
---
I would not say warriors have an issue with getting gold, its like all the other classes. Once you know what is efficient for your personal preference its just like everyone else. You spend time, you get the gold.  
---
But that beeing said, asking a healer if he wants to farm some gold together is usually what i prefer, its fun and i enjoy the company :)
---
this - just have the email you used handy and perhaps the CC matches with the ID you provide them. If you were a kid and used parent's CC - inform them and hopefully the last name will be enough. Provide them the old phone #... basically provide as much info as possible to that old account and all the ingame names toons u had should suffice.
---
I was able to retrieve my account with no fuss on ID and toon names.
---
And on day two he is killed by a Horde rogue
---
Warriors are simple.  Absolute gods of destruction in group pvp, but lackluster solo.
---
Warrior can be rough but charge and intercept are some of the most satisfying abilities in the game. Warrior is the most played class in the game so you have some competition. Be ready to tank if you want to raid, and be ready to stand out above the crowd.
---
To further clarify I know warrior has a lack of self healing I'm asking how bad the downtime is just in open world farming or doing quests or whatever is like at max level with some gear.
---
Just adding to your list.
---
And if I had to answer, I guess I'd have to say yes. If its possible to abuse it to get an edge, it will get abused. Why wouldn't it?
---
There's also the fact that your spec doesn't mean shit if you don't know how to play. A good player playing a 'bad' spec &gt; a bad player 100% of the time, especially in raids.
---
Wow. I actually really like the sound of that. Makes it seem more immersive, but I think I’ll miss the toxic barrens/trade chat. There’s something about it. I hope there is an rp-pvp server for the people who want it though.
---
The painting itself looks miles better than the actual city
---
Lol I keep FAPs on deck because freedom is for my boys.
---
what edge though? Server first? 15 years after the fact?
---
If that were the case, why arent people doing that to Limit or Method every tier release.
---
Why tailoring?
---
Dude, NSFW much?
---
Wasn't most rank 12+ PVP gear upgraded in the Paladin/AQ Patch to be around same itemlevel (yes it existed) as AQ loot? A few players will have very strong gear sometime closely after BWL launch in that case, I do not forsee many rank14s without battlegrounds mingling about
---
Rogue??? No way man I eat rogues. I don’t even use bubble when I duel rogues because it’s unfair lol
---
Oh crap sorry BFA on the brain. I meant first aid. Editing
---
My friend played on RP servers back in vanilla, they used to make these kind of challenges to each others i suppose you could have called them  achievements.  
---
So even it they wont exist, players will create or think of something. Maybe you can ask around or find like minded people that wants to make a list of " achievements/goals" on their own.
---
Back when I started in vanilla, my very young brother also started playing. A guild mate called Lloyd was paying Hunter and I was on a druid. So we played a trick on my brother. We both quit the guild and made a new one called Lloyd's Pet and we pretended that I was a new type of intelligent pet that could talk. Believed it for almost a week.
---
Mankrik.
---
I leveled an undead warrior to aaaalmost 60 in vanilla and between cannibalism and bandages the down time wasn't bad at all.
---
If you switch stances appropriately, manage your cool downs, and don't over extend warrior down time isn't as bad as people say. Keep your weapon up to date and you're fine.
---
Big tip is as soon as you hit 51 do AV until you win and can get Iced Barbee Spear. Having that bad boy to level to 60 is a game changer. I was lucky enough to win the first AV game I entered as Horde.
---
No.
---
Everyone needs to remember that this is recycled content and no ones gives a monkeys about world/server firsts. If you and you played back in the day I pity you.
---
I don’t believe that people are worried about progression rather than enjoyment and nostalgia for this?!
---
As for clearing content, I played and cleared Mc with people who I found out later sat with auto attack while watching Tv after they admitted it.
---
Found at least 3 raiders YouTube channels of full Mc progression runs just recording and not casting doing anything.
---
Mages saying the top dps spot didn’t count  on first Raggy kill because the mage who topped brought consumables to raid.
---
Contrary to some people’s belief you can clear MC with retards, I know from personal experience. 
---
Therefore if you have a brain play what you want.
---
And for gods sake take your time to level, explore and take it all in.
---
I think most people actually did find her while running down. It does require you to look inside the tent, but still, is it not exactly difficult!
---
It is not a guide it is a humor piece.
---
Vanilla had Outland as an unreleased map, it was pretty complete and it had the floating mooshrooms over red soil like in WC2 and 3.
---
A raid geared warrior slays everything. They’re top dps throughout all of vanilla.
---
Yikes. 
---
That supply and demand is totally artificial, set by arbitrary values within the design of the classes. If hunters and warriors put out similar dps levels, then hunters would be more desired. It's important to remember that those values weren't actually designed intentionally, but rather were an accident of a particular design at a particular snapshot in time. A snapshot that changed throughout the course of Vanilla wow.
---
Most would agree that hunters should put out more damage, as they are a dedicated DPS class without the ability to tank. 
---
The fact that you think that it is good design for one class to be 6 times more desired than another says something about your priorities.
---
DMT blows everything out of the water. 2-3x more GPH
---
Honestly, that's fairly reasonable.  I do feel for all those RPers though, I know they'll be disappointed and I'm sorry about that.  But, long term has to be the goal.
---
That said, I can't see many people waiting to reroll on a rp realm once they've put in the yards to level.
---
If someone is no-life and has time to farm r14 gear, then I'm okay with it. My biggest problem with the current wow that you can have the best gear even without doing any raid or high-pvp content (Titanforged). If someone plays a lot more than me, then he can legitimately can have better gear than me. You want better gear? Go farm/raid then.
---
I disagree with people saying to go in blind. You're still going to have a lot of fun playing, everything's still going to be new. That doesn't mean you have to make your leveling experience take twice as long because you just didn't know how to efficiently play the class. If it's your first time playing vanilla, you're going to spend 8-9 days minimum of in-game time leveling to 60. There's no reason to make 11-12 days. There's a lot to do at 60 as well.
---
See you in the barrens?
---
Aren't Rank12+ like itemlevel 74-78? (field marshal &gt; grand marshal) which puts them at a stat budget around end of AQ loot ish? (Kalimdor's Revenge being 81 and Dark Edge 84)
---
They were updated in 1.11 iirc, along the addition of caster weapons.
---
Don't forget about all the incredibly rare mobs that just wander around. All the crazy rare hunter pets, rare mobs/bosses, vendors etc - free roaming.
---
The contrast between the classic devs and the live devs is huge.
---
Personally I've come to appreciate the fact that this was never really a communication issue as such.
---
The cause of the problems is that WoW was regarded as an MMORPG. Blizzard, however, forgot about this and started to design it as if it was something else entirely.
---
People are confused about the direction of World of Warcraft. We have to ask ourselves what WoW even is. In response to this Blizzard have started taking niche questions about various aspects of the game in isolation, but the bigger question of how WoW is an MMORPG has gone unanswered. 
---
WoW classic is unapologetically an MMORPG. We know what it is, Blizzard knows what it is. All we needed to know was that Blizzard recreate it as an MMORPG, with all that entails, and they are. Case closed, community is happy.
---
It really isn't that complicated, but I have to say regardless that this is a breath of fresh air.
---
Like I said I don’t think it should happen, I’m just wondering what people’s thoughts were on the system besides the “link ‘chieve for inv” part.
---
This is more a problem that a lot of sets are just awful in terms of damage, even on progressive itemization I don't think casters wanted their tier sets over just X item of Frozen/shadow wrath etc (talking PVE wise now)
---
Ah ok, thanks for the indepth reply, i'm definetly going to run this for the first few patches, since this will make soloing instances easier as well! After that i'll maybe still try the other spec but this sounds really promising!
---
this is what Barrens chat should be. it's what it *could* be.
---
I was agreeing with that there might be hidden modifiers, but you said it was speculated armor values being way off, most likely if anything they would be too high for molten core if we can assume armor scales with content. The math is known and an endgame boss armor is known, theres a screenshot floating around seemingly proving Kel'Thuzad had only 3k base armor compared to 3.7k (there was bosses in TBC with lower innate armor value, like Kaelthas so this isn't a one-time occurence in wows history)
---
Thought so but wasn’t sure if tailoring had something I didn’t know about.
---
and then you ignored the second sentence where i point out that they're going to be camping you because it's the only way to get the best gear.
---
SM is the first instance where you really need to pull properly if you do it at the appropriate level or else the group gets murdered.
---
It is the breaking point between typical leveling dungeons and late game dungeons. None of the loot in there is late game relevant (except for the key) but the mechanics introduced are a stepping stone in learning the game and preparing for the harder 40-60 dungeons.
---
How are ppl from private servers the bad guys all the sudden? Servers that had progressive itemization also had the biggest playerbases, and for a reason I argue. 
---
There are legit arguments for wanting progressive itemization. As some one mentioned is it fun not upgrading items for a year at maxlevel because dungeon items are better than raiding gear? Do we need to make raiding content even easier?
---
I sure do hope chuck Norris is a thing again.
---
You aren’t fighting really good rogues then.
---
I'm not really worried about leveling tbh--the real deal is endgame raiding and the consumes and time necessary to make it happen. (the reason why I  have zero intention of playing ret in vanilla, regardless of all the nightfall meme stuff)
---
Yes you are somewhat correct, There is a lot of talk about nerf this farm because only hunters can do it and people would feel forced to roll hunter, but im saying that you just push the problem around, yes I realize the DMT Gold is higher than the other options, but it doesn't change the fact that if you nerf the best gold farm, people will just go for the next best until everything is mediocre and bland. 
---
But since you made a nice list yes, AOE farming in dungeon or soloing them is most of the time the best solution for making a safe and steady stream of gold, it has very little factors that can affect its outcome.
---
Playing the AH will ALWAYS be the best money maker, but tanks/healers selling runs are dependant on others to perform, the worse the players you sell to, the slower it goes, impacting your gph (assuming we only do sell runs for gold, not for potential upgrades) Mining and Herbing also has a degree of variance to it, you could spend hours mining thorium veins without having many arcane crystals to show.
---
My point is that as long as killing mobs or doing something for a steady stream of VENDOR gold exists, it will draw a lot of people to it.
---
Another thing I didn't like about WotLK was that they brought back Muradin. I mean, if you know that he doesn't die, his supposed death in WC3 doesn't mean anything.
---
How come the Dwarves are even in Northrend in TFT when Muradin survived? Makes no sense.
---
Hi, /u/Boolean_Equals_True
---
I was actually one of the first players to enter Ironforge during a fresh server launch sometime at the end of Vanilla (December 2006?) during Patch 2.0. Boy, what a feeling it was to see that place deserted.
---
Blind is a staggeringly bad idea. Ignore all the people saying blind is good.
---
Classic WoW is a game where you can sink two hundred hours of game time into a character then find out it just can't ever do what you want it to do. Or where you can go broke sinking money into crafting professions that will never, ever be worth it. Or where you can be stuck grinding mobs for hour after hour because you didn't know there was an awesome quest with an awesome reward hiding behind a hill on another continent. Or where your can spend your talent points on the wrong things and be significantly underpowered for the challenges you are facing.
---
It's a game where the solo game does nothing to prepare you for the group game, and you can ruin four other people's day if you do things in a dungeon which aren't obviously wrong but which will cause a wipe.
---
This game is full of noob traps, and falling them isn't fun for you or anyone else. Read some guides, pick a class you know you will like, find a talent build that is known to be good, and follow a levelling path where you get the good quests at the right levels and you will have a lot more fun.
---
I'm pretty sure Darnassus was a ghost town even in the Vanilla days.
---
Well I do fight really good rogues, so idk what you mean 
---
Conc aura + reckoning + plate and shield makes it really easy to keep myself topped off.
---
Dont bother. Modern wow is garbage. I spent an hour truing tk talk to people just as a social experiment and I got maybe 2 people replying. Social aspect is gone. Dungeons are hack and slash speed runs. World PvP is non existent. Ans battlegrounds are fill of people or bots just there to dick around with no communication or strategy.
---
Lol darnassus is not a city. It's my ass
---
This to me looks like a RP-PVP doa. The people starting on lunch that wants RP-PVP are not gonna re-roll to a RP-PVP server if they are launched after release
---
This is a several weeks old twitter post. Don't take this as a statement about RpPvP servers not being there at launch 100%. They could have changed their mind by now with all the drama on the official forums and reddit.
---
Depends if it's needed in the devs eyes (having their own data on this) AND if they make the right decision - keeping like it is for release, or adding the buffs before it can turn out wrong either way.
---
Yes you are absolutely right that it is totally artificial. There is nothing special having 6 times as many warriors as hunters that makes a raid perfectly balanced. 
---
However let's say you buff hunter dps to parse almost exactly the same as a Fury Warrior (this is what happened in TBC). Now there is absolutely no reason to bring a Fury Warrior as some fights ranged classes have the advantage over melee while the opposite isn't really true, Warriors don't have a Tranq shot equivalent, and melee classes almost always take more damaged then ranged. So now you have to balance this by giving the Warrior additional utility. And this goes on and on until you have two classes that are nearly identical just with different animations. 
---
Would it be ideal to balance hunter dps (and all other classes) so that you are also accounting for its utility and external benefits so that you have 5 of each class while retaining all the unique elements of each class? Yes, they have not been able to accomplish this in almost 15 years however so I am not holding my breath waiting for this.
---
If it were the case that one class were completely unviable to bring to a raid, I would agree that this would be something that should be rebalanced. However, this is not the case in 1.12.
---
I doubt what you say will pan out to an extent. I played on average 8-10 hours per day back in classic. All PvP just for the rank. I got to rank 11 and exalted with the three BG factions. It took me months. I expect it will take less this time around as I know how the system works. 
---
Then again, so what? It's just gear. A full blue set will require some dedication to get those last few pieces. At least for the average person. Rank 10 is a time consuming endeavor for many.
---
That wasn't ever supposed to be on the drop table iirc, so I wouldn't hold my breath on seeing it drop come Classic.
---
Do they call it Darnassus because it's full of NElf chicks, who've got asses that make you say, "Darn!"?
---
Have a toggle option to turn in achievements, so people who want them get them, and the people who want no changes never see them.
---
Dude that's such a dead meme by now. Blizz are releasing 1.12 items on launch and pvp gear will be 1.12 when they become available.
---
Because right now blizzard has little to no idea how big the player base will be on launch, and especially in few months to a year after. Let's say they do only have 3 servers and one is RP-PvP, thus splitting the PvP player base up. Then in a few months the player base plummets because nostalgia only goes so far at $15 a month, now what? You're left with underpopulated servers which drives even more people away.
---
If the RPers are that serious about it they can play on a different server for a few months until Blizzard gets a better dataset on their medium to long term population health to know it wont be a detriment to open up new servers. Then people can start a character on the RP servers and carry on with their RP ways. They obviously know the RP community is a smaller subset of their population and determined it wasnt worth the risk on initial lunch.
---
The only reason I would switch is if they give out free character and guild transfers
---
You can always hope for someone making an achievements addon.
---
We will get them. We will have to wait a couple years until we get to wrath, but we will get them.
---
Sunglasses with +4 stamina +4 strength? Huuunnng
---
I know, Im just poking fun at people. Its about as fun as poking fun of christians who pick and choose what is biblical according to them.
---
Dude, if you’re here just try it. $15. If you hate. Bail. If not, see how far the rabbit hole goes.
---
Blizzard has already put down the horse, no need to beat on it further.
---
Yeah, and anyone who don't want be ganked by overleveld n00bs should rush to 60.
---
Dumbest shit iv heard in this sub so far
---
Maybe read a guide for a class you get hype about. Don’t go over board and enjoy the ride.
---
It's easy just play on the lower pop faction and laugh at the other side having queue times
---
Having played on Nost from launch week until its dying seconds, I can confirm this. Unless you're in a tip-top guild, showing up with half a brain will net you a permanent raid spot in a guild, especially once you've passed trial. Most guilds had players who were too stupid to stack on Lava Surgers, no matter how many times you told them to.
---
I'm not joking.
---
Everquest TLP servers (classic) ended up introducing a buff to raid mobs of about 20-30% in dmg and hp because the raids were trivial for the same reasons. Though Blizzard are putting in more effort to reverse modern engine/mechanic changes, I expect the same will happen in some form for classic.
---
These TLP servers are actually now Everquests highest source of income and how its still around after 20 years... wouldnt be surprised if it happened here too, though most of the $$ came from cash shop for xp pots and mounts (hope this doesnt happen as it ruined the economy and promoted RTM).
---
What’s the argument here? Do you think top guilds with players who know the game in and out will be stuck at any boss in BWL because they don’t have 1.12 R12/13 gear? Do you think the incremental dps increase from a few players with better gear will mean they clear it in the first instead of the second week? 
---
This is so dumb.
---
Werewolves and ghosts &gt; Ogres and plants
---
I think it's just very frustrating to lose to so people rage when they do. Slooooowly being chipped away at
---
This meme if fucking dumb (like the general barrens pop trololo), she's right next to the road ffs
---
It was exactly this. Just the name. My uncle bought me the game because he tried the game 2. when my mum saw him playing and seeing its not a game shooter or like we call it in german „killer spiel“ I was allowed to play....for one week until she read an article in the newspaper about how wow is the new drug of a generation and blablabla. Needless to say I always played at my grandmas place 😂
---
This post just proves how little shit pvpers gives about their characters. Unlike rpers who dedicated a metric ton of time into theirs
---
Lol, not even close to a relevant comparison
---
Are you just trolling? It's a 15 year old game that will see nothing but steady decline from the first week of launch as nostalgia wears off and people quit paying $100 a year to play the same old content. You'll be left with only the dedicated and hardcore who will eventually trickle off as their life changes, naxx is completed and nothing new to progress or play through is released, new games come out, etc. A year after launch the amount of new players on a server who make it to 60 each month will likely be countable on one hand, while the amount that quit will be tenfold.
---
Lol for real?
---
And if you're on a low pop server that just means you queue for 30 mins to play a premade in full gear and the match ends in 5m
---
That was the problem with PvP on my server, only 10% of the games were worthwhile
---
I feel this.  I’ve been Horde ever since TBC. But considering the amount of time spent in capital cities in Classic, it’s honestly enough to make me switch factions just so I can enjoy the warm coziness of Ironforge. 
---
But I’m set on playing shaman so the decision is made for me. It’ll be orange  dirt and canyon living for me
---
There's a rare ass shirt that drops in Scholomance. There's the achievement. Piccolo of the Flaming Fire from Strat. Having the key to UBRS. Any of the epics that drop from the end game dungeons.
---
You gotta show your achievements, not look at them on a list
---
I dont think that's really true. You'll see plenty of RP guilds and groups form up on regular servers, just like they did on classic. Blizzard will for sure have someone engaged enough to determine just how serious people are about trying to RP. Sure, it wont be the same count as a dedicated server but will be a decent enough indicator.
---
It's because Metzen literally forgot about it.
---
&gt;Right… To be totally up-front with you guys, it’s my bad, straight up. The obvious lore contradiction with Sargeras and his encounter with the eredar was clearly documented in the Warcraft III manual. I wrote those bits about four years ago, and to be totally honest, I simply forgot.
---
That doesn't change the fact that many people who are going to be playing classic have several years of experience when it comes to playing WoW compared to what people had back in Vanilla (with many having over a decade worth of experience playing the game). 
---
Guides will be more readily available too. These things will never play out the same as they did in Vanilla even if the recreate every single little detail exactly how it was.
---
Pirates beat all
---
The scythe is in vanilla, but it wasn't firmly connected to druidic rituals, and there were no druids of the pack.
---
Warriors are not good aoe levelers.
---
Since they appear to think that:
---
A) classic servers are retail servers with 100k plus ppl on them
---
B) classic will have fewer then 10k players (1 realm should = 2.5k player cap)
---
C) the "no changes" dead meme is still super strong with the dumbest of players that can't even look up itemization from 1.0 to 1.12
---
Regardless of witch, people keeps proving the absolute dumbest ignorance I have ever witnessed
---
I get that, but I’m thinking of little things like falling some distance without falling, reading every book in some series, doing 1000 quests, etc.
---
Damn! Get’s me everytime... the feelings...
---
The same way they knew after classic launch - people find a way to play the game the way they want to play it. RP only guilds existed before RP servers did and it's not a coincidence.
---
I definitely understand the charm in a simpler fantasy world, and a lot of Retail's lore is often muddied by overlapping information, but one thing I'm not sure I'll ever understand is the community's disdain for the Draenei lore from BC.
---
Personally, I find the story of the Prophet Velen and the Draenei to be one of the most compelling in the franchise. One of my favorite moments in the entire lore is the Horde's invasion on Shattrath, which was later visualized in one of the [Lords of War videos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6LIty6Uea4) Most of all, however, I loved how Velen and Kil'jaeden were characterized in the Legion expansion, with the latter showing some signs of remorse and hesitation over his role in the Burning Legion. He even has a [pretty touching moment with Velen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATg67eE7uL0) at the end of his boss fight.
---
Maybe it's because I started in BC and never really had the chance to appreciate the original Draenei and Eredar lore, but I much prefer what they are now over what they were then. If anyone could share their own thoughts on why they prefer the pre-BC Draenei/Eredar lore, that'd be great.
---
Wut u think daft cunt?
---
Neat idea. You should add dungeon locations to the "destinations" so you can find the optimal flight/boat/run distance to each dungeon.
---
What sense does this make?  What if the RP'er wants to play in the past?
---
I think you're underestimating how good field marshal's/warlord gear is compared to what's around it in the progression phases. 
---
On the plus side, if you dont no life the pvp system and are in one of the top 5 or so guilds on your server you will be jumping priority on a ton of shitty T1 and T2 because 2 of the whateveryouare in your guild need nothing but off pieces for the next year since they have BiS already
---
I guess it would be better to release 50 mediocre at best servers then deal with merging them later!
---
Hey everyone,
---
Here's a call I recorded today chatting with Nano (Nostlarius QA) and listeners Fredmunroe and Ante re: the progressive itemization news we got via the blue post today.
---
Hope you find the chat interesting, cheers.
---
\- Josh.
---
This and Rammstein
---
This is undoubtly a big thing if you extend boss fights, hybrids and caster dps in general takes a bigger hit due to not having infinite resources, like a powershifting feral will lose a lot of dps once he runs out of mana, darkrunes nad mana pots included
---
Are you gonna pay for the shit you ain't gonna do in classic? Fuck pvp realms since I hate pvp and there fore i should not have to pay for em, am I right or what captain dumb shit?
---
You seem mad.
---
Look at any live realm the PVP servers always have higher population
---
Yeah let me know what server you choose, I’m capable of being a lowbie that could use a run through a dungeon.
---
Go in blind. Pick the race and class that sound cool. Ask questions as need in chat. Make friends. Join a social guild. Do anything you feel like. 
---
You'll have the best time.
---
Thanks! I used to watch your videos actually. I used some info from your video about warrior sitting as a source in 1 of my videos and I found that blue tracker website because of you so thanks :)
---
bullshit. Survival has the best pvp toolkit to slow and root opponents, also the best defensive spells against melees while BM has ONE burst every 3min wich get weaker and weaker the more gear progresses because the pet cant kill decently geared people during bestial wrath.
---
Pretty much this. I’d give it a month or two. Leveling will be slow unless you make some friends who can show you around. A first time play through is pretty special but I think the overall experience is elevated if you’re not wasting too much time getting lost. 
---
The game changes as you level up and even more when you hit 60. Give it 2 months.
---
I’m gonna kinda disagree with everyone here and say this:
---
You could research as much as possible from now until launch and you’ll still be at a massive disadvantage gameplay-wise. You will almost-certainly never know as much about the game as those who have been anticipating this for a decade. If you want to be a bumbling fool and ask everyone you see a question, spend hours figuring out quests, and waste gold respeccing useless talents, then go in blind. *We veterans have all been there* and it was fun at the time. Personally? I don’t want that experience again, and I would put some time into researching the game to get a good basis of what to expect.
---
sweet mooncloth crafting for bigger bags to hold more food, obviously!!
---
No need to spec holy until 60 or close to it, so have fun with the other trees! Holy is still good first up for Consecrate while leveling though so I recommend starting with that before going for other trees.
---
That's exactly what I think will happen.
---
I don't think that's a plus though, from Blizzard's perspective. It feels really bad to not get upgrades for a full year. Most people will lose motivation in that situation and scale bank their playing time or quit.
---
Gear progression is very important in this game for keeping player engagement high.

Unfortunately, you can't even really do damage with a ret paladin. I'm not saying that they were the worst DPS spec in vanilla...but they were the worst DPS spec in vanilla by raw damage at the very least. Group buffs, survivability to take some pressure off your healers by not ending up a nuisance to them like the glass cannons, and being able to off-heal through tough parts of a fight were the Ret Paladin's real strengths, and none of that is going to kill your mob out in the open world faster.

PvE gear is currently more viable on the live servers for PvP.
---
This thread evolved into me switching between radio channels.
---
Sounds like they will start with 1 rp, 1 pvp, and 1 pve server and just shard. \*TinFoil Hat\*
---
I faded by the end of wrath.
---
Everything was about collecting shards and doing dailies.  
---
I joined a troll guild and would grief horde and alliance questing on the isle because of what it became.

&lt;YOUR BUMMED&gt; members of Stonemaul I miss y'all

I was going to say, the fact that most/all NE dr00ds are sensitive to the Emerald Dream both gives them a built-in unity with one another that's deeper than "we all look alike and took the same job", AND it can be used to justify just about any activity, no matter how sketchy the relationship to Teldrassil;
---
"For reasons unknown. disruptions in the fabric of the Emerald Dream are emanating from below Westfall. Our enclave must investigate."
---
I guess I prefer a more fantasy setting overall. Star wars has some cool stories but I don't want them in my Lord of the Rings. They and their architecture are just too alien. Also at times I feel like they are portrayed as too light following good people, instead of more good and bad mix.
---
Unfornuatenly your argument is not a good one. People are going to play the game in vastly different ways than they did in vanilla as a result of knowing things they didn't know then and knowing everything about the game.  
---
This is inevitable.
---
God no please God nooooooooo!!!
---
Yes blind is the way. Just read everything given to you in quests and the like.
---
I envy this fella. WoW for the first time in any iteration. Must be weird.
---
Only to be crushed by the damn undercity elevator at the end of the chase.
---
Took a level 1 horde rogue to iron forge (probably leveled to 2 by the time I got there) with the best enchants and consumes I could come up with.  I would wait outside for 60s to finish dueling, then sneak up on them for an easy kill.
---
Yes exactly.
---
"Vanilla raiding was so easy" --all the people who peaked in Molten Core
---
I agree with everything, but I'd also add that I'll be very glad to have Vol'Jin and Cairne alive and well again. They died stupid deaths and should never have gone.
---
Oh yes, and NO GARROSH YAY
---
If we can just get em to not do the cancer known as sharding we will be all set for a great experience.
---
For starters, that's a fairly large generalization to make based off of a single person's comment.
---
Furthermore, you're flat out wrong about me. From 2006 until I quit in the middle of Cataclysm, I spent 95% of my /played on a single character whose ridiculous name I still answer to almost as readily as my own. If you care any more deeply about your character than I did about mine, you probably have trouble separating reality from fiction.
---
All of that being said, I would be willing to lift and shift that character or even start him fresh to play on a server whose play style I prefer, because at the end of the day it's a fucking video game and I play to enjoy it. If RP-PVP is vastly superior to RP the way people claim, there should be enough of an exodus from the various RP and PVP servers to populate an RP-PVP server per region.
---
Saw a girl working at Walmart with a Horde tattoo on the back of her neck. Thought it was cool, then as I was walking out of the store I thought "I should have walked up to her and asked her if she can tell me where I can find Mankirk's wife."
---
I love this epic snark
---
It would be pretty cool if maybe after Naxx this time they pursued a alternate universe of how the word progressed.

So much for reliving my nostalgia on Emerald Dream Classic. I rolled my main character on Emerald Dream the day it went live :(
---
Make yourself an add-on. "Problem" solved.
---
I’d go in blind and explore as much as you want by yourself if you have the time to play slow. Read the quests! I wouldn’t stress about leveling quickly, take your time, enjoy the grind. It’ll get slow but try to stick with it because the endgame is great. Make friends and goof around. Ask for help when you need it. 
---
You’ll have a blast either way but if I were you I wouldn’t over research it.
---
elemental spec is totally viable for pvp
---
what do u mean how can u play gw1? download and play, game is still active, though PvP is not as much
---
Right? I want to make a horde alt just to give Cairne a hug.
---
Rise of the Horde was pretty much a companion novel to BC, so it doesn't really count as vanilla. As for draenei, they were originally introduced in TFT, with Akama as their leader. WoW also had some of them in the Swamp of Sorrows, with a few quests, but it's understandable that nobody remembers that You may remember one of them though - Kum'isha the Collector in the Blasted Lands, who wanted draenethyst crystals. In his dialogue, he was really arrogant and looked down on other races, which is a total 180 in comparison to BC's draenei.
---
Then BC retconned all of that. Akama's draenei in TFT became the [Broken](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Broken), the "draenei" in Azeroth became the [Lost Ones](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lost_One). They didn't bother to change the dialogue which really confused me at that time.
---
Globaled?
---
Is it confirmed that realm won’t be connected?
---
I find that really amusing. People keep going on about how PvP is the only way to play but then no-one actually wants to PvP unless they are on the dominant team.
---
Debuff limit should be fucked with, if anything were to be fucked with, on the reset after this round of classic wow finishes Naxx.
---
Id love to see what classic looked like without the technical limitation of 16 debuffs. But thats not NoChanges classic.
---
Is that an XC90 in the background?
---
Dragonmaw again if it exists.
---
Just to keep up with the stats; 
---
Tipsout with a 24 minute vid 
---
Esfand with a 17 minute vid 
---
Madseason with 5 minutes 
---
Defcamp with 7 minutes 
---
Frostadamus TBA
---
&gt; I find that really amusing. People keep going on about how PvP is the only way to play but then no-one actually wants to PvP unless they are on the dominant team.
---
Yep, they also have a hard time getting people on retail to actually bother turning on PvP mode. They give awards to the realm thats not participating to try and incentivize it. And overall you get like extra talents if you enable PvP. They straight up moved to a system where they give you bonuses to get you to PvP.
---
Inb4 "hurr da durr, dwrf prizt only or git gud" rather not complete raid content then having to do it with such mongoloids
---
"A lot of other people will be at work and as such not subject to pvp. I suspect rank 14 will take longer to achieve given most of the player base will only be around on weekends. Overall OP pvp gear will have less of an impact on the game."
---
I do not follow your logic in the slightest. PvP rank is attained by having more honor than x% of the players on your same faction and server that gained the minimum qualifying amount of HKs (like 10 or 20? Very small amount)
---
How would people primarily playing on weekends affect this in the slightest? How does you being at work matter to me? Why would Rank 14 take longer to attain when a set amount of Rank Points are granted based on your finishing place for the week? 
---
"Overall OP pvp gear will have less of an impact on the game."
---
And then this out of nowhere with what justification?
---
I really think this sort of thing will die down when the game goes live. These channels only take off because people are chomping at the bit for any and every scrap of classic wow content out there. 
---
Once they can just be playing the game instead of watching a video about it, they will.
---
If you are un experienced, there might be grinding involved, but usually you can just switch the zone if the quests are too hard to complete. If you follow a quest guide from the Internet, there is no Grinding involved even. But experincing classic for the first time i would not recommend to follow a quest guide, experience the game for yourself, you still can, many others already know everything, they played the same game many years ago already. But there will be a lot of traveling between zones and continents.
---
On one hand, you are totally correct, OP, in that the vanilla lore was a lot more grounded and better made. But it wasn't without its own flaws. It came with a lot of retcons itself, not to mention Warcraft 3, which retconned the entire orc race, and so on.
---
Also, while I don't know what they did to Illidan in retail, your depiction of him isn't vanilla either. He obviously doesn't appear in vanilla, but in WC3 he fought against the Burning Legion and against the Scourge, and was last seen getting beaten by Arthas. At that time he was probably the most interesting character, so BC turning him into yet another evil raid boss was one of the lowest points of that expansion.
---
The sad part is that so many new players are going to be completely shafted because of what less then 1% says is a have to, to be able to raid
---
You can run a similar argument for pet battles and toys.  They’re just a fun little distraction. When does it stop?
---
in my opinion you should go in blind that what id did in MOP and its more fun that way just my opinion
---
You're incentivized in the current system as a PvPer to kill anyone level 48+, and the zones to level from 48-60 are limited. 
---
I strongly suggest everyone do their damndest to hit 60 before phase 2. Trust me.
---
Dynamic Mob / Loot Spawns:  
---
They've mentioned that they're going to shard starting areas for the first few weeks. Creates bottlenecks later on down the line where there will be less players just due to slow leveling. Don't need increased spawn rates. 
---
Increased Debuff limit: 
---
This changes classic completely. Think of the DPS increase by adding double the amount of dots on a target. This would make raid content completely trivial.
---
It literally would be nearly no work to implement once they know the value changes for the devs. 
---
All your doing is replacing items based on patch against a spreed sheet. This would take maybe 30 minutes to write once the spreedsheet is done
---
Source I run my own software business and have made and sold video game bots including wow bots for years
---
Yikes, no ty.

Bangin’
---
Now I just wanna know about Sharding and Release!
---
Man I love this sub. On the one hand we have people shouting that Nost and other private servers proves there's massive interest in Classic and it'll be an enormous success, then we have the other extreme where apparently the game will be dead after a year. Make up your goddamn minds. 
---
Vanilla massively expanded the MMO market when it came out. Runescape OSRS by all accounts is massively successful and gaining new players all the time, and it's ancient. Who's to say that Classic won't be successful at getting new players into it? Who's to say that Blizzard won't be opening new servers in a year's time?
---
The point is we have no idea. Classic might be wildly successful and grow just like vanilla did. Classic might die down massively after an initial surge, just like you said. I don't know. You don't know. Blizzard doesn't know. No-one knows. We're just all theorising based off of nothing. This is all a gigantic experiment with zero hard evidence. To say that it's going to go one way or another is complete fantasy. That's why I said "why?". Because no-one knows what will happen.
---
Once AV comes out, you get a 2h that has equiv top end to any 2h except R14 and Ashkandi until AQ.
---
Anyone can get that Unstoppable Force. with R10 gear (not such a tall order) and filling in with PVP rep and dungeon blues you are quite formidable to most of the server.
---
U wanna duel mate
---
They suck solo, with a healbot they are quite good.
---
Dynamic spawn breaks the lvling process. AoE groups will power lvl and casual lvlers will get no mobs from these spots. Also, people will get stuck in tight spots like caves. At some point you will run out of mana and die or won't be able to eat before next spawn. That's not fun.
---
It's for PvP not for PvE.
---
It's not actually a realm specific reward, but the entire weaker faction. So if alliance had less players in war mode last week than horde, alliance gets a massive buff. That's logical.
---
Personally I don’t care I never set my heart on wow classic must have progressive itemization or arrrrgh I’m gonna continue to play my private server. I get both points of view but I think ultimately a vast majority of players will be happy to have a socially oriented game versus what retail gases become. Because regardless of if stats change on an item it still takes a bunch of players working together to kill the bosses to get those items. Sure it may not be your ideal version but I think the game will still be satisfying to play without progressive loot.
---
Whats amusing about it? Im sure those are 2 different kind of people with different opinions.
---
You're not gonna have epics without a loooong grind to exalted with AV or something...or raiding.
---
More videos from the 10:01 club, a group of private server heroes that were 9 when Classic was live. Can mods just move these off this subreddit.
---
They have said classic is staying for good, if tbc comes out I reckon it would be entirely new servers
---
If I was to give only 1 piece of advice to a new wow player it would be to turn your character with your mouse, not your keyboard.
---
Assign your strafe left and right keys to A and D.
---
I can’t believe we are really giving a voice to RP players, they are the furries of the wow community.
---
Ah interesting, maybe I played on a version where it was usable in combat.
---
...you were one of the better guilds on the server and you didnt kill Onyxia until patch 2.0 with 41pt talent trees?
---
What server was this?
---
You can try to bait them into civilians/npcs, its DHK + they yell for guards.
---
Why wouldn't Rhok'delar be available till BWL?
---
Savage glad chest in 1.12 is aq tier fury and will be available day 1. Banthok sash in 1.12 is on par with mana igniting and will be one of the very few spell hit items.
---
The main issue with this change is it benefits fury the most (savage glad and bre) and they were already THE top dps without that.
---
After Naxx, the 1.12 content comes out and we can finally world pvp in Silithus!
---
Everyone ^likes ^^Silithus, ^^^right ^^^^guys?
---
I mean, I have an hour commute to and from work every day, and oftentimes a blue post drops shortly before I get out, so I personally like having a YouTube video covering what it’s about so I have something to listen to while driving.
---
🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Probably my favorite post so far.  SeemsGood
---
The way I see it, if the Scourge would go on a rampage without its master they're free to do so because they're still stuck on the most desolate continent on the planet, and last I checked brainless zombies can't build ships.
---
&gt; This is what they fail to understand
---
Oh im sure they understand that. There will probably never be a RP-PvP server. The amount of players that would enjoy playing on a RP-PvP server are just not enough the effort/money it takes to launch a server. 
---
Classic might launch big but unless it really booms the playerbase will dwindle after a few weeks/months and im sure if there isn't a RP-PvP server at launch it the interest for a RP-PvP server will only be lower a few weeks/months after release thus no need for a RP-PvP server that might end up dead player wise.
---
How about you go back to your classic wow tutorial videos to prepare yourself some more, write out your entire plan from 1 to 60 and worry about the professions you're gonna pick you donkey.
---
Passive-aggression*
---
Err... No. Nobody has any gold prices will be far lower and you will make very little profit
---
lmao blizz has ruined everything they touched for the past 9ish years while earlier projects around that time had growing issues, the couple projects that had potential were quickly squandered and buried under incompetency, laziness and greed as is the case with HS and OW.  
---
  This is the first time in many, many years where they're actually listening and feels like I'm seeing old blizzard being passionate about their games again, not just pushing out a soulless product engineered to make money.
---
Well to be fair sometimes a video producer may know about other facts, things said previously, extensive or extra knowledge on a subject, etc.
---
While I subjectively like draenei myself, it's objectively awful to have one race that is completely good and literally aligned with the avatars of goodness, all while being part of one faction.
---
Well, that's something
---
You don’t need to respec. An enhance shaman (as long as they have some caster gear) or shadow priest can heal dungeons fine while leveling. If you look at 1.12 healing talents you’ll find that few are that game changing, especially before max level.
---
Hence sharding
---
Yeah its a decision youve got to make when the time comes
---
Ion is a twat. Wish they’d can him.
---
Seeing Ion talk about vanilla and then Ion talk about retail is like day and night.  
---
  I wonder what's the deal with that, even in the presentations he looks way more enthusiastic in the classic stuff.
---
People are going to quit in droves once they see what leveling is like and how long it takes.
---
Baby steps, for sure. I just hope they offer that possibility. Hence I think starting with a small pool of servers but dividing them into "Pure" and "Progressive" straight off the bat would be a good move (despite not adjusting anything for a while). I love theorycrafting and most of the class pool I'm interested in is hard stuck at the bottom after more than a decade of refinement. In one or two years from now, I'd love to see ever so slight changes happening to shake things up if just so the class distribution won't be so heavily skewed (won't be an issue at launch initially, but private servers show some pretty obvious favoritism for good reason).
---
Additionally, knowing a brief overview of what you can do with each class would be a huge benefit.
---
You can avoid spoiling yourself if you keep it to knowing what you’re going into.
---
Like, if you want to be a heavy solo player and roll warrior, you’ll hate your life and want those hours back.
---
I need it :(
---
It's not that hard to find her man, she's right next to illidans throne.

Imagine getting triggered about videos that you don't even have to watch.  Just don't click the videos. 4Head
---
There is no better time to get into wow.
---
You do nax the next week?
---
I'd try to go in blind but with friends that you can ask questions and get quick responses from.  That'll save you some frustration here and there.
---
This is likely their reasoning. But the same should be true of normal RP. It seams like even less interest for that yet the were gonna include that at launch.
---
Gold buyers are the real cancer, they are the only reason gold sellers exist.
---
Yeah. 
---
Remember that guild that gave the TBC legendary bow to a rogue because the only Hunter was on a trial??
---
Lmao....
---
Yeah let's design and balance our game around the lowest common denominator in our playerbase because this philosophy really worked out with retail right? You're vastly underestimating players if something is confusing they will rise to the challenge and overcome it.
---
Kazzak takes Stormwind.
---
"Intentionally creating bad gear is bad game design"
---
No it's not bad gear has to exist for good gear to exist. If we make all the bad gear into good gear suddenly good gear doesn't feel special or exciting to find. This is why gear is completely meaningless and just a number in your ilvl score on retail.
---
how does one fail without falling?
---
Do you have a link to that update?
---
It is fine, but you really should get healing focus. It is much more important than blessed recovery.
---
NO CAPES.
---
Imagine looting an item and having to pull up raidbots to sim every piece. Oh wait that's exactly what it's like on retail.
---
This was even the case in 25 man raiding in Wrath. You tried to fit in a bunch of key classes but otherwise you just took whatever you could get your hands on. I guess very high pop servers had more room to chose from. Still 25 man raiding was pretty open to a lot of people and it was much easier to just go and raid with a guild back then than now from what I remember.
---
You only get one chance to go in blind.
---
Im mad that they're adding overpowered 1.12 dungeon blues at the start. How many upgrades will your character actually have in phase 2 when diremaul gets released when you already have extremely powerful 1.12 dungeon loot? They're taking content away from the dedicated players who wanted to play this game 12 hours a day.
---
Yes, I will make my own list now to see what is available before Mc.
---
I think that is going to be fun.
---
Oh, thats more Advanced that the one i had! I had the one that you could click the player frames With different mouse buttons :)
---
Thank you for the clarification!
---
Are they killing my quest mobs, then I'll fight.
---
Are they fighting with another one of my faction, I'll fight.
---
Are they running towards me and I don't trust that they ain't going for the jump on me, I'll attack first.
---
How far away is the corpse run if I fuck up.
---
In scholomance the bat miniboss drops a belt
---
In 1.12 this belt has 1% hit rating making it pre-bis for casters.
---
Prior to this belt being upgraded the belt out of diremaul was supposed to be pre-bis but there's literally no reason to run the dungeon and seek this item out anymore effectively killing dungeon content for players.
---
This is a really lazy change that negatively impacts the game that was only made for time constraints and money.
---
If you like the idea of being a heavy hitter with a heal up your sleeve I'd say shaman (for pvp/leveling). I remember getting Princesses Scepter of the Princess in Mauradon on my Shaman back in the day and stopping for some pvp at 49. Oh man. Freaking destroyed clothies. I remember getting a windfury crit combo'd with a earth shock on a mage and literally killing him in less than a second. Not that the experience is always that way by any means, but certainly can be. Plus anytime things got right I could just through a heal on myself. Good times.
---
Depends, if they try to hide or some shit im smacking the shit out of them. If they are pretty low i might kill them once and leave. Tough lough ya know?
---
I agree with you, I played a non-meta spec myself back then, and the amount of spite and hatred I received by just existing was horrible. So I feel sorry for all those who'll pick a paladin cause they like being a holy warrior. It will require tremendous efforts to make a unorthodox spec to perform just a little bit better (and also a very thick skin). But, IMO, if a person likes to play a moonkin and also makes efforts to play a moonking well, I don't see why they doesn't deserve a raid slot.
---
Majority of the playerbase are lazy LFR raiders they don't want to farm out multiple item sets. Blizzard knew they could get away wit this change to save themselves money and development time and us pserver folks, the ones who started this movement in the first place, get screwed.
---
Red = Dead
---
it's the law
---
I've never been a big raider but I loved exploring, finishing all the quests, collecting all the recipes I can, and working on reps.
---
Although considering how much more important server community is in classic, I'm really just mostly looking for a nice family that I can enjoy the game again and RP with. 🤗
---
&gt;Dear Blizz, please introduce sharding, I mean it's truly awesome that now you cannot handle a simple outdoor battle, it's such an amazing thing that game masters need to stop events like that, also the crossrealm thing is super great, it's wonderful to meet new people on LFR as well, excellent top class social incentive, can you please also continue to release all the expansions in a stage that someone would call Beta and never do a complete expansion, we love the lack of content...
---
Well that subject changed quickly. Anyone else you’d like to undermine?
---
True but it was and they've said that their true intentions is to "accurately and fully restore the original game’s mechanics and stats to their final and most polished state" trying to revive the experience vía content keeping systems in their 1.12 state. I wish they do
---
It's always a red day in Azeroth.
---
Ok so just based off that they can create RP-PvP servers from the start.
---
Just unnecessary. One less reason for people to speak to each other. This is actually what I would see happening: 
---
   
---
Green person: "LF1M mage for blah blah blah"  
---
Yellow person: "I'll go! I'm a mage!"   
---
Green person: "Great" -- \*sees his yellow guild tag\* -- "...oh sorry we actually already filled"
---
I didn't even consider all the crafted gear made obsolete by this change in addition to just a ton of dungeons not being worth running anymore for specific classes. What a lazy route to take for the devs. Not very pleased at all.
---
Why the downvotes? Disagreement? I thought this was'nt /r/wowservers
---
If you save up a damage set you'll do just fine, with the added benefit of all the extra survivability.  Or go HotW druid and have the best of both worlds.
---
The one thing I see as an issue is the 1.12 upgraded PvP set being released in Phase 2, as they would be vastly overpowered as you correctly point out. The other one, it's a bit more difficult.
---
Was the 58 set still available from the vendors in 1.12? (I simply don't remember nor have I played on progressive private servers) Since you said they were replaced with a different item altogether, wouldn't it stand to reason that the level 60 blue gear would be available instead?
---
The primary issue I have with this decision is it overwhelmingly benefits fury warriors the most, and they were already the most dominant dps without it. 
---
Fury on private servers are already the #1 dps throughout the game. Now add 20% more dmg from lower armor(private servers boosted armor on bosses by as much as 100%, across the board 20%).
---
Now this itemization change also gives them access to aq tier chest day 1 (savage glad), bloodmail boots are bwl tier day one, and bre. That's not even mentioning ironfoe (depending on what version can be kt tier to bwl tier), and enpherean demolisher Kazak weapon can be naxx to bwl tier. Lionheart helm is bis all game.
---
All this adds up to world of furycraft even more than it already is on private servers.
---
Looking forward to this one! Thanks for the great content Josh!
---
Rogue is high skillcap enough that you can claim it should beat anyone but warrior.  But in reality it has a few more bad matchups than that.
---
Lol this was their plan all along implement baby mode vanilla to keep the forum whiners quiet while they continue to crap out bad retail content. This was a developmental decision made to save time and money and nothing else. This game is not meant to keep us occupied for the next 10 years. It could have been bigger than retail but they're not willing to put the effort in. What a shame.
---
Mankriks wife was laid by Ragnaros? No wonder she died
---
Progressive itemization was one of the last attempts to keep the game at least a tiny bit more challenging difficulty-wise. 
---
But at this point of how many changes we have already compared to the original experience - not having it progressive is just another drop in the ocean.
---
I like to get in there and throw a raptor strike myself from time to time, but doing so with one handers just feels so much less powerful than a 2H!
---
yass a weekend guild. can i get one of them.. discord invites?
---
If I was new, I would 100% want to go in blind.
---
Well if all the angry pserver guys banded together and said we're not gonna play this 1.12 item crap and we'll stick to our free servers then suddenly adding proper itemization does have financial value. This change is a big negative for the game this is a fact. This change was only made for time and money reasons. If blizzard isn't willing to put he time and effort into doing this right there's no reason it should become bigger than retail.
---
Kill all rogues, no questions asked
---
Otherwise judge based on their name and actions. If they have some dumbass name I'll attack. Otherwise leave most people alone if they are doing their own thing. If they attack me though, it's certainly on.
---
I hope it's like this too. It would be a huge bummer to all the people that hear announcements about Classic and then Classic updates to TBC or some other shit... Then why advertise for Classic in the first place?  
---
IMO, the best they can do is stay Classic forever and create new content for it. And if that content is good, looks outdated and feels outdated like Vanilla, it will make people that play on Vanilla private servers want to abandon them and go play Blizzard's version. Which will in turn bring all Vanilla players in one place...
---
I agree. I'm looking forward to Classic very much and at this point I will be playing at least launch regardless of what happens. That said, their current system is going to make PvP gear the end-all-be-all for over a year and that's not good.
---
The items that change in stats are generally easy to acquire items with the exception of a few raid drops. Like 5 man boss drops that you could get in one afternoon. Having the item stats change really isn't that confusing or a big deal for a new player.
---
We used this, the person who had the highest dkp got 1st choice but all items were one price - it stopped ppl bidding up items to force ppl to waste dkp on items. 
---
The way we awarded DKP was zero sum, so the dkp you got for each boss fight was the total dkp of all items that dropped from that boss - so dkp inflation what limited. If no one wanted the item we have a token amount of dkp for it but not the whole amount to stop far runs being used for dkp hording.
---
Seem to work quite well.
---
You don't have to the items that get major upgrades are all dungeon blues you could farm in an afternoon if you realized suddenly it got upgraded.
---
A warrior with 2 pocket paladin healers is impossible to kill, unless the entire team attacks the healers.
---
gg forgetzen
---
Chinese children have been my friend back in vanilla already. If anyone believes gold selling won't be a thing he's straight up delusional.
---
&gt;People here love to hate on Blizzard
---
Yeah it's not like Blizzard hasn't given us many reasons to hate on them, right? Diablo fans would like to have a word with you. And BfA is such a huge shitshow. Not sure about their other games.
---
With that being said, Classic team has been doing a great job so far. I'm not a hater and I can appreciate if they're listening like the old Blizzard used to do. 
---
Old Blizzard was my favourite gaming company by far and it makes me sad what they have become. Just because they're listening with Classic that's not even out, not even beta so we still don't know how it plays, it doesn't excuse them for the other shit in my book, I'm sorry.
---
I find it kinda ridiculous you blame everything on customers meanwhile excusing Blizzard.
---
"A ret paladin that knows he can toss freedom on the rogue and stun the healer is invaluable in PvP."
---
You know what's better than that? A Holy Paladin that realizes the same thing. 
---
Ret is shit. It's been shit. It was known to be shit 15 years ago, and if you roll a Ret Pally I hope you realize you are leveling shit.
---
Classic devs are doing great job compared to retail devs.
---
The "I was trolling" response, wost save in the book fam
---
Don't make me reroll later Ion you fucking cuck
---
This is a terrible lazy update that will have long lasting negative ramifications and a ripple effect throughout the entire game. Honestly I'm no longer excited for classic. I wanted to get really invested but everything will feel like a joke compared to nost. Blizzard took the path of least resistance and they know it. I hope they're ashamed of themselves.
---
Again...sounds like you aren’t fighting good rogues. Hopefully you don’t ever have to, they are rare as hell.
---
You seam retarded, did your parents drop you on your head as a kid or did you just sniff glue your entire high-school years?
---
An accurate analogy to the hardcore guilds' exclusion of specs is living with as a short person. Sure, you can live without noticing or caring. However, girls will treat and view you differently because of your height, meaning you probably have to work harder than the average person for success.
---
What about a survival build that uses ranged attacks as normal but is slightly geared / specced towards raptor/mongoosing people in the face when they get close instead of trying to kite?
---
All I remember is she's by a tent past a bridge down by the camp to the very south of the barrens lol
---
Using that alone I should be able to find her
---
I suspect that the Level 58 set won't exist on the vendors since it wasn't obtainable in 1.12, and instead it will be the 60 Blue/Epic sets. Which you're right in that they're rather broken and will be the best sets to get until at least Phase 5. Not sure what people aren't understanding about this. Even the dude who made itemization.info was posting about this on the official Classic forums back in February.
---
I feel bad for you
---
Yeah I love when Ret Paladins spec into Blessing of Freedom since Holy Paladins dont have it.
---
Wait...what?
---
Actually did stockpile tier gear because it was hot garbage, itemization was bad. Everyone assumed it would get buffed and it did. Do not really disagree with your point I just found that line funny because that happened in Vanilla to people I knew.
---
Yes this change is 110% an overall negative that has long lasting ripple effects throughout the entire game and it's a real shame they choose to take the lazy route. Ultimately they know it's gonna harm the game they made this decision for time and money reasons. If activision isn't willing to eat the bill and deliver us a finished and polished vanilla than ultimately classic won't overtake retail in popularity. I wanted nothing more than to see this project succeed and explode into mainstream success but if they're not willing to do the work and hold up their end of the deal then I won't play.
---
If you like rpg aspects like having to carry ammo and doing class defining quests and having a constant progress that means something and a community aspect we have not seen in years, then yes
---

Yes and this could be true, but it could also be wrong. The screenshot could also be tampered with. Im not saying it was, but it isn't definitive proof

If you can't make it to 60 before BWL gets released then your opinion on how the game should be designed/balanced Carey's no weight as you're not even gonna play enough for it to matter to you.
---
Lol
---
👍
---
*lava damage*
---
Nah they do not always luckily. The loudest voice are the strict „NO CHANGES!!11“-guys even though it doesn‘t make any sense in many ways and blizz is finding a good middle way.
---
3 stances, multiple gear sets, selects and audibles the focus target in pvp, only class with a major heal debuff in the entire game
---
Simple.
---
Literally the only reason I want to play on an RP PVP is so I don't end up with bags made by FartyPooPoo and Sagondeez.
---
I highly suggest you try this on a pserv beforehand in order not to ruin your classic experience if you realize playing a survival hunter is not as fun as you think it is...
---
You might like to play another cac class in that case...
---
This, it’s definitely not a good idea to go completely blind, research enough to pick a class with style that you would enjoy.
---
Interesting, I actually dont feel starved for updates - I feel like they are being pushed quite regularly and on topics which they know we think about. such as gear progression. 
---
The reason I wholeheartedly agree with this decision is that its the same way its been done on the private server scene for ages and it works. its tried and true. The fact that they come out and explain the thought process behind it as well is a cherry on top for me personally. 
---
I want to make it clear that it is not blizzard as a whole I have a lot of love for right now, but rather the team making classic wow who, in my optics, show care and attention to the details. 
---
For me this is something ive been waiting for pretty much since TBC came out so I dont take it lightly - however sad that may be.
---
So this probably means we won’t have armorless epic mounts :(
---
The problem about newer warcraft lore at least for me is the use of retcon. Ofc it‘s easy to slap illidan on a second expansion because he was always popular and make him a new character with a new backstory going on in the shadows etc. For me thats lazy writing and a reason I liked the story of panda even though I didn‘t enjoy the artstyle that much. It was something completely new. Needless to say wc3 lore and vanilla was great and unique and I‘m especially hyped for undead starting zone
---
What build are you suggesting?
---
No he definitely spelled it right, darn 'night elf' asses
---
You sound like a spiteful bitch. I bet you play Enhance Shaman.
---
If you are the the lazy type you may find it boring. I mena in vanilla wow there are no quest helper, dungeon finder and other stuff that make your life easier. 
---
You have to read the description of the quest that said "Head up North to..." or "... near something" to know where to go next. Ofc you can install addons and stuff but I think it destroys the game experience. 
---
You'll have to find the team for an instance using chat (Yelling in orgrimmal or use global channels). So yeah nowday's kids may find this dissapointing i guess.
---
It probably is haha but luckily for me that doesnt really matter.
---
That will all happen again. Time is a circle.
---
Ive managed to get some of my friends, who’ve never played wow, hyped for the community aspect. Not having the same luck with getting them hyped for the game visuals or mechanics, gaming is so different these days. Back in the day a 10 second clip of WoW would have been enough to seal the deal but times have changed
---
Funnily enough almost all of my friends who played WoW at some point are coming back for Classic though.
---
Judging by my exp on private servers Naxx will still be a guild killer if your roster isnt prepared enough, even with all the guides and shit out there people still backpaddle in 2019 and wipe on MC.
---
Man seems like a pretty efficient way to make money.  But seems mail fraud is even illegal in azeroth.
---
Madseason is such a great guy
---
Thanks for the suggestion, but i know i like the regular hunter playstyle in vanilla. Still I want to try something new. If it works decently i'll probably stick with it if not it's not a huge problem either. I just want to make the best effort to make it work and see if i like it.
---
Have you thought about somehow making this an in game add-on?
---
It basically depends on how pissed off I am. But I never graykill.
---
I also didn’t play it myself but I think part of the reason why there apparently only 1% of players who cleared it was that it was true last raid of the game before tbc came out and due to what I’ve read they rather waited for the next expansion since all the gear from naxx would’ve been useless as soon as the next dungeons came out. 
---
I think it will still be pretty hard but depends on what blizzard will do when the end of the expansion draws close, re-release tbc again? Reset the everything some kind of? Only time will tell
---
Imagine all the NPCs running arround like : " ok guys we have like 2 minuts left before they arrive , dont fuck up this time. Everything is ready ? "
---
So what you say is BM is probably better in the early days of vanilla because nobody is really geared, but the more time passes the better SV becomes?
---
When ICC came out my friend and I did tons of TOC pugs for gear on our alts. Groups would always hang out inside while waiting for people to join or arrive, and would stand around the guy you talked to to start it. If you started it there was about 30 seconds of easy to miss text dialogue before you were locked in and the bosses spawned. While waiting we would repeatedly start the event, run outside, and watch as everyone inside died. We somehow got away with doing this tens of times for every group, and the naive people arriving offset the victims who decided to wait outside afterwards.
---
After boss kills in cata I would stand with my back to the edges of platforms and lifegrip raid members that were moving. Lifegrip would cause them to face you, so if they moved forward at all they would fall of the edge. Since they were moving, delayed reaction/input time or lag or something gave me a really high success rate of shooting people into lava and the like.
---
For money.
---
Killed in a global cooldown
---
Up until level 10 so far. The difference is insane.
---
While you're right, the level 60 Blue and Epic set will be available in Phase 2, only the top 1% ranking players on any given realm will even have access to this gear, with the top 0.1% getting access to the weapons. So is it really that critical of an issue?
---
Jokes on you, I’m going to play a healer.
---
I really thinking that classic is going to be HUGE experiment for blizzard. With retail they are doing this " We know better whats best for players and do things our way". Obviously this isnt working too well, since subscribe count is declining and players seem to be unhappier than ever with on going expansion. 
---
With classic they are trying to do what majority of players want and listening to us. Sure they need to do compromises in here and there. 
---
Im excited to see where things go. If classic is succes, maybe it will change the mindset they have with retail and everyone wins.
---
With major trolls blood, some bandages &amp; food you should be all good. Not a whole lot of downtime imo. I loved warrior at 60, especially once you get some gear. Personally I found the late 30s and early 40s to be the worst on horde side, even with whirlwind axe.
---
When it comes to farming it's pretty easy. Can easily make 30-50gpm in farming areas like azshara, felwood, winterspring or Silithus by just killing things. I was able to farm the azshara satyrs for felcloth and runecloth during low pop hours and easily make 60g+ per hour with pre-raid gear, depending on the price of felcloth Ofcourse. If you happen to have herbalism I'm sure you could up that amount by a little. 
---
Point is that farming solo as a warrior is not hard at all, especially with some consumables.
---
Warrior is weak at PVP while levelling so I'd wait phase 3 to level this alt. Most of the PVP action will happen in BG.
---
Frankly anything PVE related (tanking, grinding, questing) is good on a warrior. People are pussies.
---
If you have epics you'll almost never stop while grinding (even with blues it gets very good).
---
Um sorry what now?
---
Learn to read, I’ve actually said that Feral is alright with dedication. Doesn’t change the fact that a lot of guilds won’t have any, that Warriors are better at its role and that it’s a one per raid spec.
---
Naxx was difficult for its time although big part of that was just players being bad at the game and it being really difficult to replace them.
---
Best guilds will clear Naxx within couple of hours of it coming out. Average guilds should be able to do it just fine if they can just keep a raid roster together.
---
Nah ban gold sellers and buyers and never let them back. I’d rather a small but risky market of rule breakers rather legalising this shit.
---
Came here to post this. Lok'tar.
---
Guards were working well in Vanilla, so you will get ganked outside town a lot and more rarely inside.
---
But if you think it's going to reduce ganking, &lt;insert sweet summer child quote here&gt; ... ;-)
---
*stealths by and saps that downvote button*
---
The second Best feeling is equipping a helm.
---
In Vanilla it's broken down by classes and rules generally, not groups. Your experience stems from 25mans, which is 5 groups of 25. Your expecting the same breakdown for a 40 man raid. 
---
It will be similar, but different all the same.
---
I was going to say this. Holy shit it’s one of my favs lol, even got the song on my Spotify. When the Tauren pops battle stance and charges into the battle. I was sold. Never wanted to see RS again.
---
Dude fuck off, seriously. There are gazillion posts like this. I agree with your point that they are doing well, but you don't need to go out your way to suck dick. " I thought we could use the time to express our gratitude for.." , you sound like someone who tries to make this about you. This is circlejerk at it's purest form.
---
Fuck \#NoChanges
---
Give me autoloot.
---
They didn't say they're doing it this way because they can't figure out how to do it the other way, they said they're doing it this way because it makes more sense.
---
I have the same problem atm. I dont know if i should go alc/herb or engi/mining
---
Potions are good when leveling, but so is bombs.
---
Tailoring is pretty much a must if you want to use the best gear during most content, and Engineering is a money sink but provides huge advantages in PvP. 
---
I’d say Tailoring/Mining during leveling, store the metal and stones required for leveling Engineering in your bank/on an alt, sell the excess ore. It won’t make much profit, but as a Warlock you get your level 40 mount for free and can farm better than most classes.
---
Naxx just told you if you were in a real raiding guild or a big group of friends with &lt;Our Name&gt;
---
More of a guild *maker* than breaker imo
---
hard*est* but not necessarily hard. Everyone will be able to find raid spots as long as they can provide the skill, sympathy and some gear. Don't worry about it too much, would be my advice.
---
Achievements are good for the game in the long run, take away all the rewards from them, and any that may affect economy in a big way, if there is any.
---
They give people some thing to do and keep them playing.
---
As you have to remember, there is fuck all to do in classic, 3 bgs and 1.5 raids, unless you can commit to serious raiding.
---
And also, how many raids do you see killing city boss, in wrath there were nearlyeveryday for a few months people wanting the achievement, helped wpvp.
---
But they won't t add stuff like this, this is one of the few games to be released that I think will stay true to its core. Normally games change to suit casuals after a while because casuals keep games running when 5%ers move to the next game, but as it is included in the subscription, the devs are most probably not going to cater for them too much, as that is what retail is for.
---
And I'm pretty sure somewhere down the line a addon might be created or something.
---
that right
---
That's good. Also refreshing to see the positive community reaction. Was expecting people to be like "THIS ISNT HOW IT WAS IN VANILLA"
---
At the end of the day, having the stats on half the items in the game change drastically after every patch would just be confusing. You would have to know the stats of multiple versions of an item, farm for an item that isn't useful at the moment, but will be useful in 6 months, and you would have trouble looking up the item on wowhead.
---
It’s still going to be difficult. The lack of experience is absolutely not an excuse. I was in a guild were some of the players, at the end of vanilla, had more that 365 days of play out of the 2 years (meaning more than 12 hours a day on the same toon...). we raided 3 times a week to do AQ and Naxx only. We achieved 12/15, missing the 4 horsemen, saphiron and KT.
---
It’s just that you have to be prepared, you have to be optimal and on the contrary of my previous guild, every player was ready to have a shitty skin in order to min max. Some player were spending 100 gold per day to respec and be optimal between raid and pvp.
---
Yes, definitely pserver players fine tuned and optimized a few things but lot of things were already known by god guilds at that time. But in vanilla you have the place to be a min maxer in a hardcore or progression guild, or be a casual in a progression or casual guild.
---
And then hiding it because it's ugly AF :)
---
Nope, on mobile and I'm lazy, it's in the content phases blue post.

---
It’ll take a minimum of 3 months to hit R14 from the day phase 2 starts. 
---
No one knows what the nerfed 1.12 r14 we will be like in pre bg honor times. The pre nerf system, it was pretty much impossible past rank 10 without an organized group and bgs—and I think on classic, there wasn’t a lot of time between PvP system and bgs arriving. 
---
PvP weps top end at 353, huge to be sure. But Ashkandi is 344 require much less effort and will be more widely available with them potentially entering circulation at th3 same time. 
---
If phases are in accordance with the patch cycles, 1-2 maybe no GMs/HWs will exist before the first Nefarian kill. If that’s the case, can we don’t have a 4+ month phase 2, then GM weps are fine. Marginally more powerful than Nef weapons, but a fuck ton more exclusive.
---
Grinding r10 for pve purposes was super common in the day, and being on a premade after raid and working towards R11-13 was common enough for the progression oriented players who raided. 
---
If you no life 18 hours a day 7 days a week for 3-4 months, you deserve the best weapon in the game for the majority of the games life cycle.
---
I'm not sure it's possible to get R14 without BGs. World pvp is very inefficient even if you farm flight points.
---
I know it's completely with good intentions but personally I'm just annoyed when people try to give me free stuff.
---
I want to play the game and collect everything myself, not given handouts.
---
They can be skilled, but you won't 40 people that are highly skilled.
---
That is reality and it doesn't say anything against what I have said.
---
You just can't comprehend that there are 40 individuals in a Raid, you just assume that everyone in a 40 man Raid is the same and has the same skill.
---
Casuals can be bad and good, because Casual raids don't look for skilled or bad players, they are just looking for people to fill their Raids.
---
Do you not understand what Casual means?
---
*sweats in sharding*

Kill Kel'Thuzad (and all raid bosses before him). Then move on to Classic TBC. :)
---
Going by Blizzard's old math, it's mathematically impossible to earn Rank 14 sooner than 12 weeks.
---
You can only earn a maximum of 13000 RP per week with a 20% decay each week. It requires 60000 RP to hit Rank 14. So assuming you were earning the MAXIMUM Rating Points per week, this is how it maths out:
---
* Week 1: 13000(Rank 4)
---
* Week 2: 23400(Rank 6)
---
* Week 3: 31720(Rank 8)
---
* Week 4: 38376(Rank 9)
---
* Week 5: 43700(Rank 10)
---
* Week 6: 47960(Rank 11)
---
* Week 7: 51368(Rank 12)
---
* Week 8: 54094(Rank 12 Still)
---
* Week 9: 56275(Rank 13)
---
* Week 10: 58020(Rank 13 Still)
---
* Week 11: 59416(Rank 13 Still)
---
* Week 12: 60532(Rank 14!)
---

If you aren't pushing your meme spec to the fullest you are roughly between 1/2 and 3/4 of a real contributor. It is very feasible that the MT will put out more dps than you.
---
When I say "real contributor" i mean a braindead moron that is spec'd properly. That's how bad most meme specs are. 
---
I have no idea why the playerbase chooses to focus its ire on people trying to play the game as opposed to its designers. That is where your real qualm lies.
---
&gt; Play what you want!
---
The problem with "play what you want" guilds is that the top players will leave and new "play what you want" players will join and soon your "play what you want" guild will be forever stuck un MC/Ony. Is that really what people want to play?
---
Early on there was a bug. I had a priest and would /duel people and if you timed it right you could slap a SW:pain on them right before they lost the duel.
---
They kneel but the DoT wasn't removed and they died. I did this outside of IF all the time.
---
I was on a PVE server so I'd duel horde all the time and kill them too.
---
If world PvP is as great as the proponents say why do all the PvP servers end up with such imbalanced populations?
---
Answer because they only like it when they win. So really world ganking is what they consider awesome as lone as they're the ones doing the ganking.
---
And in Stormwind you can hear in the distance a roar of men, women, and squeekers marching hastily towards the city. "RAAAAAAhh"

How much lore did WC1&amp;2 really have? Maybe it was all in the manuals but there wasn’t really a huge amount of lore in the gameplay, since unlike WC3 the only story was in pre-mission briefings.
---
I could implement this my self in under a day.
---
"Something that has never really been touched on this forum might be a incredibly important implementation in classic WoW LATER ON."
---
Yeah, "never really been touched on". :eyeroll:
---
Apart from talked to death, you mean? (Sorry, I'm not trying to be rude but you should have looked a bit more...)
---
Because classic experience is impossible to get I've played with the idea of Blizz rerolling the loot tables. That would make us re-discover the drop locations and and grindspots. Also bosses could be tweaked to get the same effect on rading/dungeons.
---
But this does go against the idea of classic. Perhaps that would be the (lite)osrs route some people argue for but I'll just wait and see what Blizz comes up with.
---
It’s content designed for over 1/2 your raid to die, and 1/2 those still living to hover around the 10 apm level. 
---
Most bosses have 1 or 2 mechanics. The world of Warcraft community has known the raid for 15 years. 
---
Outside of requiring naxx gear to not get 1 shot, Any decently competent guild could do 8/10 first night with all dps and healers at level 58.
---
A friend of mine leveled a holy paladin in vanilla with a furry warrior tank buddy. They mostly leveled by soloing dungeons (upto and including defeating Herod while he was red), which they were able to do quite well. So it's perfectly possible to do, if that's what you want. He did eventually get the character to 60 I think, all the while being holy.
---
This sub is just a circlejerk for loving anything blizzard pumps out. It was the same with sharding, loot trading etc; everyone changed their mind to like it just after Blizzard announced they would implement it. Anyone who disagrees with the decision is labeled a “troll” in order to keep this echo chamber rolling.
---
Anyone who attacks me first for no reason (ex. The red = dead buffoons) gets killed and then permanently camped whenever I see them again.

---
So servers that had progressive itemization were not popular because of the progression, most people I talked to didn't like it. Only a small subset of people like it and honestly all it adds to the game is confusion and gear scoring. It doesn't drastically change the difficulty of the raids...
---
I've created one. It's already full. ;)
---
There is no need for Blizzard to do anything. Remember the mantra? "community! interaction!" Talk to people. Advertise your guild in a way it makes clear what your goals and expectations are.
---
&gt;The moment you tailor exclusively to the needs of the minority, things go wrong.
---
Well that is not really what happened. The game changed in a way to cater towards solo/casual players. Everyone can do all the content now with very minimal effort and social interaction.
---
 In vanilla this was not the case. Actually there was a ton of official forum whining because of this. People felt entitled to being able to get high end rewards (epics) w/o doing the social thing and joining a raiding guild. There were regular posts of people wanting more casual content and how it was "unfair" that raiders got better rewards than non-raiders because they both pay the same price every month. I shit you not.
---
And that was what Blizzard gave them. But the issue is: Nothing really feels epic anymore if anyone can do it. Raid difficulty tiers feel artificial and anti-immersive. Killing a boss in vanilla felt special, partly because of the sheer number of players you had to organize. It felt epic.
---
Some people claim that the vanilla raid mechanics weren't as diffcult as the modern ones. I agree, but only under the premise that the information is spread. Doing first tries in BWL was actually difficult because of some of the weird mechanics in there. Having 40-60 or even more players on a certain gear level doing content together for that long was incredibly difficult on top of that.
---
Now the got more convenient and overdesigned. Now it is all about cosmetics, easy access to content, everything can be done alone. These aren't results of catering towards hardcore players.
---
I personally feel that Blizzard is going the right way with itemization though. It makes the game more polished. When I clear BRD and get my stuff from there I don't need to do it again after a certain patch. I think it will just feel better this way.
---
But don't easily dismiss the arguments of hardcore players. There still needs to be a proper difficulty curve for raiding to feel rewarding.
---
Here’s to hoping pservers got it wrong and less of those armor debuffs stack. 
---
Decluttering the debuff table would be nice, sunder or expose, faerie or recklessness, only 1 item prove for armor on boss.
---
I raided for the first time on Nostalrius. MC was super easy, ZG was easy. BWL was the first one that was somewhat challenging. I stopped playing before AQ, so idk about anything beyond that point.
---
Even before the itemization changes, gear from MC was basically useless. There are still some BiS items though like the Onslaught Girdle which makes it worth running.
---
I'm in this same situation. I personally am going Gnome Warlock. I really wanna level alchemy and herblore because that's the profession I enjoy most. But I also can't ignore the importance of Tailoring. While also acknowledging that I'm a gnome who loves pvp and probably needs Engineering/mining. I don't know what I'm gonna do with professions yet.
---
I can do nothing about that
---
Just 21 points in holy is enough to make the pally a great healer, and 40 points in Retribution gets you Repentance, plus more judgements to slow the enemy, a great aura and faster movement speed. Is this a ret pally or a holy pally?
---
Yup. Bombs add a lot of extra dps and control.
---
Same for rogue/warrior/druid
---
Hmm that's not a bad idea. Just seems like a hassle to have to move all those mining mats around.
---
You can only earn a theoretical maximum of 13000 Rank Points per week with a 20% decay each week. It requires 60000 RP to hit Rank 14. So assuming you were earning the MAXIMUM RP per week (being the #1 Contribution Point earner on your realm), this is how it maths out:
---
Keep in mind, to even stay ahead of the 20% decay pushing to Rank 14, it's required that you earn more than 12000 RP just to stay afloat.
---
A more thorough breakdown of the math covering far more than this is available here: https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_System
---
Taunt, all shouts (demoralizing, challenging and intimidating)
---
Nope, its because retail pvp is shit.
---
The guy who hard counters this guy.
---
Oh man, I did this to people. Was it the spike that you could walk out on? Would be funny if you were one of my attempted victims of boredom. Played on Garona and Skywall mostly.
---
Well that sucks. I had initially planned on making my character on an rppvp server. I'm an rp noon but I made one on one back in BC and bumping into real rpers was pretty cool. 
---
I'll never forget riding around in org and I went through some water that a troll was fishing in and he was like 'eyyy Mon you be scarin away de fishes!'
---
I'll probably go Tailoring/Mining, store all the ores on a bank alt, and drop it for Engineering at some point, maybe phase 2 launch.
---
Are they part of the development now?
---
The only thing sadder than the videos is people who make threads like this who get triggered by them.
---
I personally find that great. Items like this actually feel epic. BRD is a perfect example. Ironfoe, HoJ and the Gladiator Chain are all items you can wear for a very long time if not forever and they drop in a fantastically designed instance. For me an RPG is really not about upgrading all the time, in fact it feels better and more epic to have more space between upgrades.
---
This thread was limited to OP wanting to play melee-centric.  
---
For a normal player without any limitations survival is great.  I think in most pvp you would rather have scatter then wyrenn sting, but other then that the tree is very strong.  You just 95% play as if you were marks, with some more melee damage when you need it, added durability, and more control.  
---
With enough agility it outdamages marks even at range because of lightning reflexes.   Deep marks is mostly preferred in pve just for trueshot aura.
---
So RP that the old pacts are still in place, or go up and challenge every enemy you see.
---
What if they never changed the items, but instead removed the items from the drop tables and added a new item that represents the updated version?
---
In phase 1 it might drop the weakest version of Bonereaver’s Edge, but in phase 3 it instead drops Bonereaver’s Blade, which has the stat Bonereaver’s Edge would have had in that phase.
---
This way you avoid having to worry about items that might become better later, you make content difficulty closer to how it was in the specific phase and you simulate not knowing the item progressions in advance.
---
You can only earn a card cap maximum of 13000 Rank Points per week with a 20% decay each week assuming your realm had at least 250 ranking-eligible players in total for any given week's calculation, smaller realms could theoretically not have enough people to have a Rank 14 due to rounding down. If number of rank-eligible players (NR) is less than 250, the Rank 14 bracket will contain NR * 0.002 &lt; 0.5, rounded to 0 players. In that case, the top scoring player for the week will earn 12000 RP (top of bracket 13) rather than the usual 13000 RP.
---
It requires 60000 RP to hit Rank 14. So assuming you were earning the MAXIMUM RP per week (being the #1 Contribution Point earner on your realm), this is how it maths out:
---
People are going to be in for a rude awakening - The majority of Pserver players (most of this subreddit) think they're going to be Rank 13 and have Naxx on farm a few weeks after release.
---
Leveling is what I'm looking forward to the most. I don't have the time to do raids anymore, but spending months faffing about the world while leveling? Sign me up please.
---
Of course it is. The system is a comparison against other players from your faction. There is always a first and a last. And it’s as difficult to maintain first with bgs than without
---
Same here
---
"There's a saying in football "availability is the most important trait"."
---
Not very many hardcore WoW players suffer broken thumbs from raiding too hard.  High school kids cut practice, yeah I agree. I was one of them.
---
Players in the NFL and even NCAA are "available" when they aren't hurt. This is such a shit analogy that I'm upset I even addressed it.
---
"What they're saying is if a guild has a choice between 30 perfectly maxed characters and 40 capable characters they're gonna choose the capable characters first."
---
False dichotomy. What really happens is the 30 perfectly maxed characters cherry pick from the 40 PUGs and pick out the most ideal adds, and those 10 people are fucking ecstatic that they get to raid with a real group instead of their usual slew of idiots because, well, they are the 10 best people of the 40 and that's why the 30 hardcore guys selected them.
---
"there's no reason to feel pigeon holed into a specific spec/race/gear combo in order to see end game content."

Total strawman. Nobody gives a fuck if you play a DPS Paladin. They just wont invite you to their raid. There is this weird sentiment that minmaxers dont want you to play your preferred spec. Nobody gives a shit what you play. Experienced players simply feel obligated to point out that while being an Enhancement Shaman is perfectly acceptable for leveling, it will not work for the majority of your character's lifespan.
---
I dont give a shit if you play a moonkin at 60. I just want to give you every possible chance not to end up being unacceptable for raids if you intend to raid.
---
Many, many players leveled up as Ret and thought they would be able to continue as Ret in the endgame, and why shouldnt they? It's worked for 100+ hours, in 99% of games that means it works. In Classic it means you're level 50.
---
I'm in the exact same situation. Antone know how much it's worth?
---
From looking at the legacy videos I noticed that from the moment the ship / zeppelin moves to arrival at the destination its around 60 seconds. I agree though that 2 min overall might be a little optimistic! I'll probably have to bump that average by a couple of minutes or so - would be even better to have a live arrival and departure time, not sure if its easy tho
---
Amen.
---
You can only earn a card cap maximum of 13000 Rank Points per week with a 20% decay each week assuming your faction on your realm had at least 250 ranking-eligible players in total for any given week's calculation, smaller realms could theoretically not have enough people to have a Rank 14 due to rounding down. If number of rank-eligible players (NR) is less than 250, the Rank 14 bracket will contain NR * 0.002 &lt; 0.5, rounded to 0 players. In that case, the top scoring player for the week will earn 12000 RP (top of bracket 13) rather than the usual 13000 RP.
---
This whole thing will blow over as soon as people play the game.
---
Or at least I won't notice, because I'm busy playing the game.
---
Yeah. Gotta be a PvE realm.
---
The 1.12 version did physical damage, this is the version we'll be getting.
---
Lolwat, you think Classic is going to beat LoL/CS:GO/whatever tournament viewer counts?
---
That is how I’m looking at it as well! I’d like to have the freedom of being able to farm gold as mage too
---
"nobody is impressed if you top meters in decade old content because you grinded good gear and can spam 2-3 dps skills with the optimal spec that's been laid out for you in a guide"
---
When you kill the boss easily yeah, sure. Nobody gives a shit.
---
When the boss enrages at 19%, though, suddenly you look like a whole lot of fuckall at #22 on the meters, dont you?
---
This. I get that rank 12+ should have powerful gear, but It's a big balance issue if said gear is vastly better than everything you can get in PVE for a year.
---
I mean consider we get the updated honor calculations because of 1.12. Therefore ranking will be easier and multiple rank 14 at the same time will be a thing.
---
Yes. We survived not knowing shit and so will you.
---
If you have played other RPGs before you will be just fine.  Each class in WoW, Classic Especially, is heavily inspired by pen and paper RPGs.  So if you understand the basics of how hunter/warrior/mage stuff works it is pretty similar to how you might expect.
---
The biggest learning curve comes from knowledge of random systems, and those are easy enough to ask about in general chat or google at will.  Don't try to learn everything beforehand or it might get frustrating.
---
I think hunters are a bad example, having your epic level raid-tier gear be BiS is one of the best feelings.
---
I wonder what you base that on? The best guilds back in the day took weeks to clear, if they managed to at all. That place was rough and unless Blizzard nerf the difficulty its not gonna be anywhere close to "a couple of hours".
---
I would say it's still a better solution than having no RP PVP at launch, only to add it later. That will also destroy community aspects for the people who want to leave once the RP PVP comes and those who end up left behind, with the added bonus of having to reroll (I don't think they had transfers to new servers in vanilla, but I'm not positive)
---
Go in blind if you can. Wow classic isn't rocket science.
---
I did that once, but I do not think I have the patience to do that again. That's possibly the worst grind of the game. But man, I loove my saber.
---
On PrIvAtE sErVeRs iTs eAsY
---
Thanks! No plans at the moment, I've been working on this since Nov last year. I'm using Typescript, React Hooks, Gatsby, GraphQL and several other libraries for the modal, notifications, map etc. 
---
I originally wrote this with docker and kubernetes too but realised that my costs were more than my netflix subscription with that approach. I'm now using [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) which aside from its many other benefits, seems more affordable to host.
---
How so?
---
Yup.
---
Idk much of the pserver meta in pvp, but back then a t3 warrior as flag carrier was nice, otherwise i haven‘t seen much of them around
---
Unless there is a way to delete your knowledge about WoW there will never be a true Vanilla Exerience again.
---
But Classic is still the superior Version of WoW, compared to Retail.
---
If for example there were 200 people in a zone on a server they might split them up into 4 shards of 50 people, so that they can all get things done. if a 201st person shows up they would start another shard and fill that up next. They stated they would only do this for the first part of the game so there aren't hundreds of people in one zone competing for the same mobs. While its a good idea from a gameplay perspective, part of the magic of vanilla was that you were on a server with everyone else on that server all fighting and living together hand in hand. If  someone decideds to camp somewhere and hunt passers by on that spot all the time then you must get around them or kill them to pass. If you adventure around the same areas you will bump into friends who are in the same level range no matter how many people are in the zone. It was all one single world no matter what.
---
I remember this being a thing too, but it might have been added later.
---
it's because they want money
---
Kill if:
---
- its funny to do so
---
- you haven't killed them in the last couple of minutes (eg no corpse camping)
---
- they are your level range or higher
---
- you need their quest mob or mine/herbs etc
---
Basically i try to pvp a lot without actively being a dick, but often I'll just leave someone if i dont feel like fighting.  You can have fun non-combat interactions with the enemy sometimes!
---
Yes! I've been thinking of this too, it will take some time to get those locations and coordinates but its definitely doable. I would love to see this feature too
---
It will be, player know more and play better now days.
---
But ppl allways forget the biggest point, raid back then where buggy as shit at release.
---
And the insane numbers you hear ppl callout like 110 days until aq40 was cleared 1111elf, classic raiding is so hard, is because bosses where buggy as shit and unbeatable.
---
Its a trend that ppl forget until late BC Raids often where broken for the top 1%, and the top 1% did more shit/did know more shit then we give them credit for.
---
Maybe make it so world buffs don't linger if you enter a raid?
---
That way people don't have to worry about that avenue prior to actually going in the raid, as well as raising the difficulty in the process.
---
So you want a casual guild that only raids 8-10 hours a week, but clears all the relevant content in that timespan because its members show up prepared due to their efforts spent during non-raiding hours?
---
That's called a hardcore guild.
---
You mean the Antonio Banderas blow up doll that Cartman opened up and thought it was a gift for him? It was Cartman’s moms and was in season 3’s Halloween episode.
---
You are totally right, but missing the point.
---
To paraphrase them, "You aren't in competition against perfection, you are in competition with the general population ... and just LOOk at those mouthbreathers"
---
&gt;There are legit arguments for wanting progressive itemization. As some one mentioned is it fun not upgrading items for a year at maxlevel because dungeon items are better than raiding gear?
---
Then just pass when that gear drops and let some other poor sucker get stuck with it for a year.
---
Meanwhile you could set up your own progression plan where you only roll on gear that is only slightly better than what you have so that you can get the most fun possible by upgrading every slot the most amount of times.
---
&gt; And fuck over all the non hardcore players in the process? No thank you.
---
In vanilla content was tuned so that most people would not see it at the time, hence they were "fucked" but honestly that was what made it great. If you don't git gud you don't get to see content, that's good for all players.
---
&gt; Raids don't need to be super-hard, and they shouldn't be trivial either. Vanilla struck that balance very well.
---
Except based on numbers vanilla was tuned harder for people's capability at the time than anything else in history. 
---
&gt; To such morons I only have to say this: If you suck your own fun out of the game, don't blame Blizz.
---
&gt; Classic doesn't need harder raids. Classic needs right-minded players.
---
Textbook scrub. You think game should be played by arbitrary self-made rules rather than just rules of the game. This is wrong because everyone can have different ideas of those arbitrary self-made rules. Game creator can never please this mentality because these players never respect the game's rules, only their own. If the game mechanics allow raid clear by day1 in 20 minutes then it's the creator's fault, and it's the game mechanics that should be changed. Not "well I expected most players to play with their head stuck up their ass and make up self limiting rules on how to play the game and balance it around that" That's absurd.
---
He's thanking them because they made a private server so successful that it finally got the ball rolling to get official servers.
---
&gt;or maybe the people who run it are just a bunch of tools who took their ball and went home when they didnt get their way
---
that is an odd and unhealthy amount of aggression for no reason
---
I was a BS through and through and I can't say anything from 1-300 was changed.  I could be wrong though, it's been a while.
---
I'd love to go back to classic with no memory of it. Vanilla are my best memories of the game.
---
It took me a good 20min to find the exit of the Tauren starting zone because I was to dumb to read the quest :-)
---
The announcement was far too early. Hype has already died within my group of friends. I'm the only one that still read news, this subreddit and so on.
---
Guess I'll have to pick a solo class.
---
Go in blind 100% I even suggest turning off your screen!
---
No really, id want to read about classes and what there is to do in the game. If you havent played before I dont think you will spoiled by reading some guides.
---
JAMstack is definitely the way to go. 
---
I'm curious about the calculations though - I suppose you're using Dijkstra's to find the path, but did you have to manually time all the flight paths to find the weights?
---
&gt;On the one hand we have people shouting that Nost and other private servers proves there's massive interest in Classic and it'll be an enormous success, then we have the other extreme where apparently the game will be dead after a year. Make up your goddamn minds.
---
It's from that experience with multiple private servers we know that the interest is never higher than on the release day. It doesn't drop fast at first, but once KT is dead it really starts to plummet.
---
&gt;  Runescape OSRS by all accounts is massively successful and gaining new  players all the time, and it's ancient. Who's to say that Classic won't  be successful at getting new players into it? Who's to say that Blizzard  won't be opening new servers in a year's time? 
---
I think an important difference here is the general approach to the project. What OSRS is now isn't much like the " our aim has been to accurately and fully restore the original game’s  mechanics and stats to their final and most polished state from before  The Burning Crusade " attitude that Blizzard has towards Classic. The nature of OSRS having updates with actual new content makes act pretty much new a new MMO in terms of interest.
---
While we are indeed all just speculating, I don't think it's reasonable to say it's based off of nothing. It might be flimsy but it's not nothing.
---
Can't I be positive and enthusiastic?
---
Anyway it's not like they will likely read this... so not sure what you're talking about or what are you trying to achieve with your comment other than being hostile.
---
there are plenty of resources on google 
---
from memory retail nerfed the process several times
---
i actually think any collection profession will be a pretty big pain in the ass if they dont boost spawns (and i certainly dont want them to boost spawns)
---
vanilla was slow thats what we want
---
I've never made an add-on and I'm not great with LUA. However it would be fun to try once classic is out
---
LOL.
---
I used to go to Darnasus quite bit back in the day for the things they did have on offer. Of course I mained mage, so it wasn't exactly a challenge.
---
i expect , when naxx will come out, 3 months later if will be first time cleared.
---
Yes and he's downloading it to documents which was standard at the time.
---
That was pretty easily possible in actual vanilla.
---
Wed 5 man ony late Vanilla (and my guild never got past huhu) in t2 gear for the bags.
---
One guild on my server was very selective of who they trialed or membered. They would routinely raid bwl and mc with 20-30 people.
---
thats fair enough
---
lol "We have no idea what we're doing, just like in 2004. Honestly I'm surprised they're still paying me. I mean, I assume it'll all work itself out."
---
Now as a guy that really wants RP-PvP and even got convinced to join a podcast regarding it last night. (CTC if anyone needs to know specifically)
---
I firmly believe if they aren't present within the first week (RP-PvP servers) then Blizzard should never introduce them after that point the dedicated communities that really wanted them likely will have settled and their key leadership likely will have pushed hard passing the early level 40's in the level process.
---
Community is the main thing, many of us seem to comment about loving in WoW and thus it would be extremely hard to level a server after you integrate into it. We also don't want to be dedicating a PvP server as a proxy RP-PvP as then it restricts the community even further by removing the non-redditers etc from knowing its the proxy server.
---
Like every player here we want a home, we can love and for us its the differing options that RP-PvP gives each of us and each of us has different views on it.
---
Now obviously there are concerns say regarding server merges - this issue with any form of server merges is name concerns as it makes it incredibly hard for any RP server to ever be merged because it can cause chaos and damage to player's established characters. This is something that can never be avoided but in general a strong community led RP type server (RP-PvE and RP-PvP) will be the server where players constantly generate new content and new entertainment even if they have exhausted dev content.
---
Why is this downvoted? It was an answer to a question...
---
Heck i was a NE priest, supossively the worst race for priests but once i got my first raid invite and consistenly showed up for raids each week after prepared i was invited every time.
---
I wanted to play horde, and I think undead race is the coolest so I'm gonna play undead rogue. At least that's the first one I'll try.
---
See the best option is to learn if you want to - every RPer is always improving or slowly getting rusty i guess ;P
---
It just comes down to how that community is forged and who leads it - you want the more open Roleplayers and generally I believe they are more present on RP-PvP because it has huge options for reactionary RP.
---
Yup I'm using Dijkstra's here, some of the data is from add-ons and some from watching vanilla videos of people travelling. There are currently two ways I calculate the paths, one is weight on duration the other is simply the route with the least paths as this is sometimes preferable. When classic is out I'll go and check these times are correct and update them if not
---
Raid mythic top 20 us (or at a level where you kill bosses well before mythic guides come out) and clear a tier on retail and come back and say retail is a curb stomp. 
---
Vanilla is fun for a lot of reasons, brutally difficult pve raid combat is not one of them. Even naxx is mechanically simple, it’s just very tightly tuned. The hardest part about classic raiding will be keeping 50 or so people happy and showing up to raids for three years.
---
If you also suggest adding at a later date and offering transfers - remember thats basically like signing a warrant saying - damage your current server and its community and start a server with nothing on the AH etc etc.
---
Would you call a successful leader who demands top performance a neck beard if it were in any other aspect of life than a video game?
---
Planning on going 1h with shield this would be Ok i guess. Not the dps a warrior is used to ditch  out.  Your covered in CC's that share DR and no healer would be scared since the lack of MS.
---
This would probably be a "support" role, not a Good one since mages are better in both support and dmg and druid on capping flag tbh.
---
&gt; RP, like autism, 
---
10/10 start of a sentence, lol.
---
The one to heal the party for a bit on melee hit?
---
I mean, its not bad if youre in the tank group to give devo aura and have to go melee to reg some mana via wisdom and get the heals in inbetween ... but thats prolly to rare and to low to actually be usefull.
---
Important for that would be the 3% hit I guess?
---
I liked the undead (well, forsaken I guess) lore the best out of all the races, and I think I'm gonna try and play rogue because i think it kind of suits the whole undead theme.
---
My guild could only kill first 2 bosses in spider wing and the guy you needed to mind control adds for. Naxx was tough, we cleared BWL every week, ZG and got up to Twin Emps in AQ40 but for a guild like us(25 good players, 15 carries) it was too much
---
Blizzard designed bosses around specs that everyone played ignoring not working (not underperforming but exactly not working) specs and I don't see anything bad about throwing them under the bus. Just wait for TBC classic and play a hybrid if you are so addicted to boomkins.
---
&gt;The people starting on lunch that wants RP-PVP
---
omg it's a release schedule leak!!! we might not know the date, but release at lunchtime confirmed!!!1
---
I have a video of a shaman in my guild doing this.
---
There really wasn’t such a thing as “PvP gear” in vanilla. The “PvP gear” that you could get was just as usable in PvE as any other gear in the game. Concepts like Resilience and PvP Power that diifferentiated PvP gear from PvE gear weren’t introduced until TBC. Did you even play vanilla?
---
Oh, I thought they had joined the Classic team. I get it
---
That is probably a likely answer for some folks. Smashing face with bre when people are looking at Blackhand Doomsaw as a decent wep would be the most OP you’ll ever feel in the game.
---
"You can't look at a meter and see how having a Feral dps providing 3% crit to four Warriors, gives you more raid dps than just having 5 Warriors."
---
I genuinely wish this were true, but it isn't.
---
In addition to Blizzard's normal in-game Naming Policies  ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/naming-policy), [EU](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/naming-policy)), players on Roleplaying servers are expected to abide by the rules outlined in the Role Playing Policy ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/roleplaying-policy), [EU](http://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/role-play-realm-policy)).  In summary, players should: 
---
* **Create a name that fits within the World of Warcraft universe.** Remember that rules for Roleplaying servers are in addition to the regular Naming Policy ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/naming-policy), [EU](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/naming-policy)) . "Iwillcrushyou", "Roguesftw" and "Shammysrule" are examples of names that would be against the Roleplaying Naming Policy. 
---
* **Stay in character in /say, /yell, in emotes, or any other channel used for roleplaying.**  This means no discussion of real life events or people in these areas.  Players should also take the time to spell out words and phrases.  Refrain from using internet jargon and acronyms such as "lol" or "pwn". 
---
* An example of what is to be expected on a role playing server, using a pirate theme based character: 
---
*-Ahoy mateys! Ya'll never guess what loot was that ol' witch packin' into the treasure chest*   *-All beak and no bite as usual Salty, spill the beans or take a walk down the plank!*   
---
* Also, an example of what is NOT acceptable in a role playing server: 
---
*-rofl guys i just pwned 5 nubs in stv*   *-ORLY?*   *yarly!*   
---
* **Maintain a positive atmosphere for roleplaying.** Harassment of other players is never tolerated. 
---
Under certain circumstances, however, shorthand and acronyms are  indeed used. In combat situations or raids, "battle jargon" is generally  acceptable, as one would definitely evolve to convey the most strategy  in the fewest and shortest words. Directing parties using fully worded  "There is a patrol incoming, please move to my location", while  atmospheric, would prove less effective than a brief "pat inc, cmere".  Abusing "war lingo" outside of combat could be simply considered rude  IC.
---
I would at least recommend choosing a class based on what you want to do in the game.  Some classes are very good or bad at different things, and will largely be pigeonholed into certain roles for PvE content.
---
Burning terms of levelling guides or content spoilers, I'd stay clear.  You'll pick all that stuff up over time or when you want to do so anyway, but you'll never get the chance to see the game with fresh eyes ever again.
---
Grinding world quest is so fucking annoying and takes so long that instead of PvP being a fun experience that spice up your outdoor activities becomes another annoying fact making the world quests even a longer draught.
---
You would be a network engineer, but a shittier one.
---
The questing and leveling experience is amazing, because even in the worst expansions the art and sound design teams are always absolutely on point, and it's just so much fun playing through the new areas.  
---
Pandaria is gorgeous, even WoD (which is regarded as the worst expansion ever) was tons of fun before you hit max level, and Legion has some pretty cool class-exclusive questlines.  
---
All of that you can try out just by reactivating your account, no need to buy any expansions.
---
After that though? Don't bother, pretty much everybody hates BfA, and the endgame has reached almost mobile game levels of forcefully trying to keep you playing.
---
Spam shields on warrior tanks. Anti-rage generation, yo!
---
Nefarian is my endgame.  I never much cared for the AQ aesthetic, and Naxx will take a long time to get to.  If I can clear BWL, I'll have some everything I really want to.
---
Playing the auction house is way different to farming dungeons. Farming dungeons gives vendor loot so brings gold into the world. Playing auction house just moves gold around. You'll earn more playing the ah the more people are farming dungeons. Also means tanks and healers can charge more for runs. Both of those methods dont affect inflation like farming dungeons does.
---
Alliance are kill on sight.
---
I kill them one more time after they re spawn. I will leave them be after that unless they want to have another go
---
It's really hard being a guild of 20+ people who are all RPing in a world where they're hailed all as the one true champion. The general background structure of retail for RP is basically what it would be if all orcs were told they were the warchief when they made a char in Classic. I'm not saying retail RP is impossible, but if you want it to work there's shitload of crap you need to totally [overlook.](https://overlook.You) You would likely also need to plan out a leveling route beforehand because you'll otherwise find your character travelling back and forth through time pretty casually.
---
This is the reason why I personally have never liked PvP servers. WoW is still and always has been primarily a numbers game. You can be the best player in the world, you still aren't going to beat a fully geared max level player with a level 35 alt, or a 5-man gank squad by yourself. Hell even at max level gear can make all the difference causing an imbalanced fight. This is beside the point but from an immersion standpoint the whole kill on sight mentality pvp players have towards the other faction at times in WoW's history when Alliance and Horde aren't in open war with eachother has always felt a bit off to me.
---
It sucks that I don't get to participate in world pvp, which can be fun at times, but I don't take satisfaction out of uneven fights, in neither the advantaged or disadvantaged role. As a person who's primarily focused on PVE anyway, I'm willing to make that sacrifice and get my PvP fix in battlegrounds where the goals are more clear and the odds are slightly more evened out.
---
I think challenge in any raid won't be actual raid mechanics but to have 40 people who are willing to use their time to do all required things (farm restistance gear, attunments etc). People do struggle to get 20 people in current retail to raid so 40 can be quite challenging.
---
Do you mean tough love?
---
Yes
---
Why can’t you no life it? School isn’t a valid excuse; just ask all of the people here who played Vanilla when they were ‘in school’
---
Polymorphing someone in water would cause them to swim down. That was cause for lots of trolling fun in booty Bay. 
---
Kiting devilsaurs from un'goro to xroads was great.
---
Definitely getting your hunter pet cursed by hakkar and then dismissing it only to bring it out solely for meniacal purposes later on was great fun.
---
When I lvled a pal on a p-server I was asked more than once to tank dungeons, I also did dps.
---
I think in sunken temple we were like 3 Palas, doing different things as ret. 
---
I wouldn't worry about it as a Pala. 
---
However I also watched two seasons of stranger things on Netflix, because the playstyle as ret was boring. 
---
If leveling is your main thing.. You basically autohit and wait for proccs. Which I found very boring.
---
You can autoloot
---
Hear hear!
---
It’s possible, but retardedly hard. You need 4-5 warriors at level, and 4 or so locks, maybe a Druid. You need them relatively read  to get beat on by level 63s—all the tanks need to be 60. 
---
Dps is hopefully 60, but 59 could work. Healers can be 58. 
---
You could even argue that leveling a bunch of hunters, like 7-10 hunters could be useful since they level so fast and they do good damage with shit gear. 
---
They could get to cap first, assisting with the tanks getting geared and one farming fire resist potions. Maybe another on mining for enchanted thorium? Can you even get those built that few days into max level if no one else is 60? 
---
It’d need Method levels of organization and planning with scheduled sleeping and eating to keep people going and on task. It wouldn’t be fun, it wouldn’t be a challenge beyond proving you could have maybe survived Hell Week at BUDs.
---
Simple in terms of being "overpowered" or shit. They are OP in group fights, and pretty shit otherwise.
---
I am not staring at you. õ\_õ Just act natural.
---
You'd have to edit out disconnects and stuff, obviously, and probably also permission to run a bot. It would be amazeballs if Blizzard support it.
---
Sony digital is legit
---
You're sacrificing too much damage, you'll be tank as fuck but won't be able to kill anyone. I remember fighting prot spec'd warriors on my rogues on the past few private servers and they were pretty much a free kill, well it would take a while to kill them but they did 0 damage to me.
---
My endgame is levelling fishing to max this time around.
---
I am mimd of hoping for an alternate universe development path.
---
An eventual development in to TBC without dungeon finder or flying. 
---
Class balance was perfect then, except for &amp;_$+!#@ druids and their flight form, which no fly fixes.
---
5 man dungeons and heroics were brilliant etc...
---
Pserver players know what they're doing dude and aren't underestimating the game like most people on this sub LOL
---
Guides ruin games. Go in blind explore, read quests. God i miss when i first stepped into wow.
---
&gt;using meme arrows outside facebook
---
It certainly wasn't walls of text and tons of dialogue, but I've been frequently surprised just how much stuff from WoW has been around since WC2.
---
Dual spec would be a God send.
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
Hey, I'll play any warcraft title. Unless it's orcs \*in\* crocs, then I'm the fuck out.
---
I will kill everyone once, but I'm not camping anyone. Red is dead.
---
My vanilla guild used a loot council but we individually listed our preferred gear per slot and would get priority on it when we reached that content.  So some people wanted priority on MC gear so that they got a power boost early, while others wanted to wait to get it on BWL gear so that they got their BiS a bit faster.  And it could change per slit, so a rogue might have set their priority on an MC dagger but not on the armour.
---
It worked well enough for us.  I don't remember there being any loot drama because if it.
---
Pserver players know how difficult and time consuming it will be. People in this sub think they are gonna clear Naxx as a 40 year old gamer dad playing 2 hours a week with 20 boomkins in their raid.
---
While I commend you for your memory, this is a piece of detailed information that I could have spent the rest of my life without, and still be a happy man =)
---
AFAIK they are going for "authentic museum" kind of thing, not actually a playable game. For the latter you'd need a lot more changes than just buffing the raids. On top of buffing raids pservers have to had to do a ton of changes to make for more playable game.
---
Believe it or not, it’s actually a really good system. In fact, it’s one of the only decent systems in BfA. It works really well. Too bad the rest of the game is relatively bad (aside from M+ and raiding).
---
Lmao right I type 200 words to my girlfriend on my phone before my uber gets here
---
If we are getting items in 1.12 state like BRE i believe we will be getting rhok'delar aswell.
---
Players tend towards the path of least resistance. Same reason why players who hate dungeon finder will still use it if it exists.
---
This change happened gradually between when this sub had 10,000 people and today when it has more than 75,000.
---
Different class of player.
---
Go ahead, call me elietist because I think players having their ADD properly medicated is a low bar...
---
Who said anything about the epic quests being removed?
---
*cries in troll shadow priest*
---
I recently leveled on TBC private server and I can tell you what really worked for me was   
---
a) picking locations where not a lot of player are (i.e. not questing in STV)  
---
b) not engaging in PvP unless neccesarry, most of the times when I spot a player I just left him be and he left me be. Killing him would mean that he would be killing me back and it would be a waste of time for both of us.
---
One thing I’ll like is having day night cycle synced up again. I’d be playing in the middle of the day on Saturday and all the sudden it’s dark in game cause the server is located in Eastern Europe or someshit.
---
No. Not worth it. You can just go deep arms, have 10% critical bonus with axe, still getting stun resist. 
---
If you want CC bring a hunter or mage. Also, imp shield wall is a dead talent, 5 seconds every 30 min. Also passing on anger management for overpower seems bad.
---
Same here, have played hunter in vanilla and pservers but would like something new at 60. My only concern is the time needed to level a Pala and with my work schedule being so unpredictable I can't dedicate time to play with others because they will get ahead of me. A paladin seems good to me for my first 60 due to not buying Mount (not interested in a lock) and having the pre 60 option of filling all 3 roles but with all that said the hunter was alot easier to level whenever I had the time to log on...
---
all that weapon swinging drains the muscles of potassium
---
It is, but there's also the special circumstances of having 0 money at the start and being able to farm and produce most things yourself. I would have a pretty hard time gathering the mats for, and crafting, an iPhone on my own if I find the one on sale to be too pricey. In WoW there's literally nothing that others can make that I can't also make, given enough time.
---
It's funny how Bads think codeword casual is legit cover.
---
Like everyone and their brother can't watch the "casuals" waste 2.5x as much time failing a raid as "tryhards" spend picking up their loot.
---
No, rhok is from quest that was added in 1.4. BRE is just drop that has updated stats.
---
Yeah this is incorrect because people that lvl on a fresh server need every piece of silver and they know if they put the items in overpriced they will earn nothing because nobody has gold yet.
---
So all that work they did proving it with math, you disproved it? Can I see your source?
---
Watched a guild with several people in t3 wiping on patchwerk few weeks ago. Seems like most guilds will struggle.
---
I didn’t remember they did this. Kind of cool as I remember them not doing it for orcs and some helmets were ruined because your teeth would clip through their front.
---
You can do that in a day brotato haha
---
Pserver players have a more realistic view of how hard it is. Half of the guilds who clear MC on pservers fold before killing Nefarian. Even more fold before killing C’Thun. I would bet only 3-5% of pserver players clear naxx. Y’all just happen to see videos of the ones who do.
---
That was not even remotely the point though. So you're either to stupid to get it, or intelectually dishonest.
---
Skill level sure, but the average player will most likely still try to min-max to some extent, because that's literally what a huge majority does in about any online game these days. That's the 'culture' right now.
---
It depends, if by average you mean your gear and preperation to Naxx then no.
---
Sure this time compared to vanilla, more casual raid guilds will down more bosses but Naxx was not only a gear check instance it was also a much much more time consuming prepation instance.
---
If you really want to experience Naxx then its gonna be expected for you to perform above average.
---
you wont be trash tier because of that. The questline is amazing , but rokdelar is really average.
---
&gt;I would vendor anything grey, mail whites to an appropriate alt (1 for tailoring goods, leather goods, etc.), I would put greens and blues on AH, if after 2 tries they didn't sell I DE them. 
---
You realize this could've made for a 10:04 minute YouTube video guide right? why you givin away gold nuggets for free bro, get on it
---
https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641?s=20
---
You're right, we might not be getting Rhok at launch, but judging by this post made by Ion, we will get 1.4 content in Phase 2.
---
You need to outgear your opponent massively, talking two raid tier at least, to make any sort of impact. The impact in those cases will be doing little to no dps, not having rage because no one bothers hitting you, and using a stun on cooldown. 
---
Well geared warriors are decent as flag carriers in wsg if you lack a druid, and that’s about it. 
---
You literally can’t kill anyone who chooses not to be killed. In group pvp you’ll be ignored because all you have is a stun and zero damage. 
---
This is probably the worst spec in the game for pvp, and it’s fair enough that you ask openly, but all the clowns in this thread who claims it’s in any shape or form viable should never give advice on anything related to vanilla again.
---
Lmao
---
No not rly, hunters are so strong early that it's fine.
---
&gt;Textbook scrub
---
I have no respect for people who insult others because they can't defend their point of view, nor do I take such people, or anything they say seriously.
---
With that being said:
---
&gt; You think game should be played by arbitrary self-made rules rather than just rules of the game.
---
Clasic Wow is neither Poker nor Chess. It is an MMO offering multiple avenues of enjoyment, and multiple ways to play the game. There is no defined way to play it, there is no defined goal of the game, there is no defined End of the Game.
---
Therefore, your statements makes no sense, simple as that.
---
It's a game to experiment with, explore it, spend time in and have fun. You get to define for yourself what's important to you. I had a raiding main character, and another one that I maxed and then spent an extrodinary amount of time collecting everything related to fishing with. Guess what: I enjoyed both.
---
If you narrow the game down to a small path, that's okay, it's your decision. But if you believe your decision how to play it is the "right" way, and everyone who disagrees with you is a "textbook scrub", then you are just delusional.
---
I think CRBGs is the default expectation unless they provide hints otherwise.
---
Yeah, the first 8:39 are showing and reading the post. Why do people throw their pitchforks up without thinking?
---
Will do raiding and all that, but what I really am looking forward to is making twinks and wpvp xD
---
Entirely different roles. Compare dps to dps and healers to healers.
---
completely agree, the talk of min-maxing is going way overboard... although i dont see people pushing gnome mage for that int bonus though haha  
---
the VAST majority of people will not be pulling their 100% optimum dps with perfect consumables and positioning.  anyone who plays a weaker class (hunter/feral/ret etc) can do just fine in an average guild if you put in the time to play it well  
---
play what you fucking want, not what a bunch of neckbeards demand
---
If only it was that concise
---
Just to pile on, the same goes for food. Sometimes finding a vendor that sells the appropriate type is a real hassle.
---
I find trees to fix this problem. They either come to me or leave.
---
I can definitely agree with that but if it wasn't well received then as an alternative to that I'd suggest reducing the gold cost of changing your specialization at a trainer instead. Currently it costs 50g once it's maxed out; lowering that amount to 25g would still keep it as a gold sink but grant some leeway to classes that often have to change specialization's.
---
If you write first but no one else was there to see it, were you truly first? I miss philosoraptor.
---
Warrior FC is only decent if enemy comp is melee heavy, else it's dog shit because low mobility and armor doesn't do shit vs casters.
---
&gt; not plan ahead for what the game will become at some point.
---
Except that that will be the case anyway. All the content is old and mostly understood. People can plan to collect resources that might not be necessary in the early phases but are critical later on, unlike vanilla wow when what was required for certain things wasn't known until that content released. This complete transparency of the time-gated content is already going to majorly change how many people play this game compared to the original version. To think otherwise is naive, especially with the increased focus on min-maxing that's prevalent in online games today.
---
Also, there are issues with how items were changed over the course of vanilla wow. Some items became stronger only after harder content (and better gear) released. But with those items in their final 1.12 form from the start balance will be affected in the early stages. But Blizzard has given their stance on this so there's not much point in arguing about it. Maybe it won't really matter in the end and people will just get used to this slightly modified set of content. Just pointing out why people were arguing for progressive itemization in the first place.
---
That spec is very bad for PvP. In 1v1 it maybe helps you beat a rogue or another warrior, if you have better gear. In group PvP you do so little damage you’re basically irrelevant. Now if you combine this with full engineering toolkit you can do some flag running and flag holding. But druids are better at that too. It’s really a terrible PvP spec. But by all means convince yourself through experience :)
---
Fuck skilled rogues. The only way to fight one is to bubble hs
---
I love your work
---
And good luck on that boar playthrough!
---
is it me you're looking for?
---
Fuckin A
---
Pservers has 500-1000 extra armor on naxx bosses we know how difficult the raid is. It's hella fucking difficult but a really fun raid. It will still be cleared within 2 months for all decent guilds that still alive at that point.
---
Lol that’s not my style in any case but I think that would be more the strategy if you’re being ganked. I’m more referring to duels or open field pvp where I was pretty much always the aggressor thirsty for those juicy HKs
---
yea this, you dont even need skilled players but you need dedication and i argue dedicated players that sick with your guild are way harder to find then just ppl that play good.
---
Live servers are PvE now. Flag was in PvE realms always. They changed tiny things like only allow to switch it on on Orgri, switch it off on any rest zone without implied cooldown, add some incentive to switch it on.
---
It's not about changing the difficulty of raids.
---
As it stands, there's no reason to think we won't be getting all of them unlocked off the bat. They seem very set on 1.12 outside of raid releases. The only thing we won't see right away is the Darkmoon Faire of course.
---
I have Tinnitus so there's always something on in the background.  As far as the other gaming community YouTubers, I'm interested in the topics but can't be arced to be subbed to every game specific sub and follow all drama/news across multiple social media platforms.   
---
Different strokes for different folks
---
For sure it's a good time
---
I suppose it's the best time actually
---
There is a lot of guides on Classic so you won't struggle
---
This sounds worse than enhancement shaman or even boomkin. I will be so happy and confused if you come running at me to melee as a hunter.
---
Exactly. Private server min max players put tonnes of time in to prep.
---
I should post my guilds cthun prep list for each role from our discord. It’s huge and mandatory.
---
It can only be earned through pvp, so it's pvp gear, doesn't matter if theres a difference in stats.
---
Earned through pve? Pve gear
---
Earned through pvp? Pvp gear
---
That simple.
---
No need for nitpicking and feeling superior over other people because of your oh so sophisticated knowledge.
---
I'll keep in mind that we need to have this clearer on mobile. We spent very little time on that part so far. We just wanted to get this out the door so people could start using it. Thanks!
---
It’s irrelevant how gear is earned, what matters is that PvP gear is just as useful for PvE as PvE gear. How do you not grasp this?
---
I hadn't heard about sharding. How will that work exactly?   
---
It does, in a way, but what other alternative would you suggest? I'd personally rather raids be changed (health increase etc.) to account for the increase than go on with the debuff limit of 16 and continue having half of the classes unable to use most of their spells or talents due to such a limited design. I'm not saying it should be removed, just increased (maybe 24 if 32 is too much?). It's definitely something to consider.
---
aerie peak horde
---
LOL naxx has four wings, a dps check, two resistance checks, a tank check and a retard check. 
---
Two hours is stupid. It’s a two night clear for elite guilds.
---
Basically the ranking systen is not based on the total amount of honor but on how much honor you get compared to others on your faction. It's a slow grind no matter how much you get. If you are #1 on honor you gain the maximum amount of points, and going from unranked to r14 takes 12 weeks. But obviously staying #1 or top 5 for 3 months straight isn't very realistic.
---
&gt; Also, people will get stuck in tight spots like caves. At some point you  will run out of mana and die or won't be able to eat before next spawn. 
---
Very good point; at this stage I think I'd can the suggestion of dynamic spawns.
---
Being insulted? It's a term used to describe the mentality you demonstrate. You should look it up so you don't waste time writing paragraphs of irrelevant argumentation. 
---
All games have objective rules that apply to everyone, and ALL games are susceptible to scrub mentality. In chess or poker alike you can form an opinion that doing a certain play is "cheap" or "not fun" and then not do it. So you are just playing with your own subjective rules now.
---
However I didn't say you can't do it. What I said is that you are wrong from expecting everyone to play according to your subjective rules, and you are even more wrong for stating that the game should be balanced around everyone playing according to your subjective rules. There are objective rules available to everyone and that's the only rules the game should be balanced around.
---
'bout Draenei
---
the only thing is that they were known as Draenei in WC3, not a Broken Draenei
---
So we expected all Draenei look like them, not only corrupted ones
---
Prot  shield slam, think its called that, can crit huge, and potentially do more than arms. But... And its a big but, need full naxx block gear, so ain't happening any time in the next 2 years realistically
---
It's not about being stronger makes raids easier, it's about how unfair it is that PVP items suddenly is GOD level gear when it wasn't in vanilla.
---
You are right in some way, it is irrelevant because it's equally in terms of time sink to get equivalent gear from either content. What you fail to understand here, as can be seen throughout this whole thread and your responses to other people, is that, just because people KNOW how pvp works nowadays, doesn't magically let them overcome the huge amount of grind it takes to get that gear.
---
Well, I would go blind
---
Because I don't wanna hurry through classic, but to read the quests and stuff
---
It's the one thing I'm the most in-favor of; the fact that more than half of the classes in the game can't use abilities or talents in a raid-setting is quite frankly, poor design.  
---
As much as I love Classic, this is definitely what irks me the most and I'd be interested to see how it'd change the class meta just by increasing the debuff limit, since a lot of classes wouldn't be so useless.
---
Depending on the class, R14 gear is either BWL or AQ, some of it is even better than AQ gear.
---
Look at the swords, they are stronger than anything in BWL or AQ except for the cthun dagger.
---
Auto-loot is missed sorely.
---
Because it's not blizzlike.
---
I agree with your entire post, but my premise goes back a bit further in time than yours.
---
You are right to point out that designing for total accessibility is todays WoW problem (well, one of its problems). But it didn't start in Classic, no.
---
This design philosophy started in WotLK. And the reason it was spawned, was because of TBC. TBC was the pinnacle of "design for the elite". The raids were brutal, demanding, had a high barrier of entry and demanded a lot of time.
---
Fights like M'uru were not just hard...they were idiotic. It's not even a creative fight, the mechanics can be explained in a few minutes, and all of them are boring af. But it was tuned to be an absurd numbers game, that had nothing to do with being "committed" any more, but solely with being dickishly, over the top inflated difficulty, straight out of the asian grinder MMOs of years gone by, where bossfights could take hours...not because the mechanics were complicated, but because the boss had more HP than there are electrons in the observable universe.
---
Naturally, this design philosophy spawned the question how it is fun for the majority of players to be excluded from the raiding content even IF they tried, because they didn't try super hardcore.
---
And the answer is simple: **It isn't fun.**  
---
Raids should be difficult, demanding, and at times unfair.  
---
But the moment they demand you to kill other guilds raid-progress by ninja-recruiting every warlock and shaman from their roster into yours, lest you have no chance of progressing, something is very wrong with your design.
---
----
---
And now Blizzard being blizzard did what they always do: They did a 180, and started to completely trash the raid system, by piling ever more convenient roads into it on top of an already existing pile of accessibility. In doing so, they devaluated raiding as a whole, destroyed the reward system, made loot meaningless...everything you described.
---
I guess, my point is this:  
---
Whether you make your game too hard or too accessible, you fuck it up. Classic hit a sweetspot between the two, with the only problem being not enough time for everyone to enjoy the entire content, simply because the first extension came out and trivialized it.
---
Luckily, Classic Servers won't have that problem :-)
---
No it's just that it's not fair to reward r14 players with gear that's far better than anything available and it was never like this in vanilla so it's completely unblizzlike.
---
R10 2set bonus is BiS until fully AQ decked.
---
Totally get why they were but it's always been unrealistic and hostile to a large number of players. I would have liked to see a Classic revamp of both loot and content in order to keep the challenge vs reward balance true to Vanilla but that's also not realistic.
---
All in all this system is the fairest for all types of players as the item you get is the same item regardless of when you get it. 
---
Who knows, maybe they will change items later on. We shouldn't worry about power levels and such at this point.
---
&gt;All games have objective rules that apply to everyone
---
There is not a single rule in Classic WoW that says "This is how you have to play this game."
---
I am done wasting time with you. You obviously think you know better than everyone else, and you believe you have the right to talk down to others. I will not accomodate such behavior.
---
Therefore, you can consider yourself blocked.
---
I don't think that's true about the dungeons. In fact, i think it's almost the opposite. The fact that there's a lot of now BiS items dropping from LBRS, Scholo and Strat means people are doing those instances more regularly. 
---
When I played Nostalrius, I remember as soon as Dire Maul was released it was so much harder to find groups for LBRS/Scholo/Strat from patch 1.4 right up to 1.10. The only reason people ran them was for quest chains, farming orbs or the few hard to get BiS pieces like Baron's cape. Dire Maul/UBRS just offered more quality loot in greater quantity. This way, there'll be more reason for people to run those other dungeons because it has drops that can compete with DM loot. 
---
It's definitely a shame about those craftables though. Arcanite Reaper, more like Arcanite R.I.P
---
Couldn't agree more!
---
I raided with an inferior spec during Vanilla, dagger rogue. And although I never purchased a flask or seldom used buffs besides Mongoose and sharpening stones, I was always selected for raids in our guild that on paper had much better candidates to choose from than me.
---
Why is that?
---
I was reliable, showed up on time and was consistent in my attendance.
---
Even after I was fully-geared I helped other guildmembers run ZG etc.
---
I never slacked off, didn't matter if we progressed in AQ40 or cleared MC for the hundreth time, I always gave my 100% focus-wise.
---
I knew my class and the encounters to perfection.
---
We never fully cleared AQ40, so in terms of trying to be a hardcore raiding guild we failed. But that was not solely because of inferior specs, but rather down to attendance and people making individual mistakes due to a lack of concentration.
---
Also 15fps computers and atleast 1 people crashing in every encounter didn't help back in the days :)
---
It's the exact opposite it's funny.
---
With retail, they implemented everything the community "wanted" and what the people complained about to cater to widest possible audience and promote convenience over immersion.
---
With classic, they kept the original designer's intent and are re-creating old school RPG with mechanics that can be not exactly intuitive and inconvenient, but have indirect impact on better gameplay.
---
&gt;Would you call a successful leader who demands top performance a neck beard if it were in any other aspect of life than a video game
---
If my beer league team "captain" tried pushing us as if we were playing in the NHL he would get ridiculed to no end, so yes. People play games to have fun, winning and losing are both a part of that.
---
&gt; And don't give me the "success equals attendance" crap like op. Successful leaders lead to win. It's the ONLY metric for measuring leadership.
---
Success is dependent on what you set out to do. For my guild success means clearing content with as few wipes as possible in a reasonable amount of time, but focusing on cultivating a fun and relaxed atmosphere. For a true hardcore guild success might be getting the best MC clear time ever. Both are valid forms of "winning". I can tell you earnestly if I had to push my roster to the point that they weren't enjoying it, and even though we cleared a handful of guys didn't show up next week, I wouldn't feel very successful.
---
&gt;If I clear naxx with 5 fewer happy people who had to go holy in stead of ret and you wipe non stop after clearing most but not all of it, I'm the winner.
---
You WOULD be the winner, if this were some kind of PvP competition to see which guild could clear the fastest, but its not and you aren't. Winning for you might look like clearing MC in 30 minutes with a bunch of people who's enjoyment don't give a shit about, but winning for me will be building a community that looks forward to spending 2-4 hours a week together clearing content and having a laugh.
---
Please do. As someone looking to experience C’thun for the first time in Classic, I’d very much like to see it.
---
But at the end of the day there’s a beard on your neck, who’s the winner here that mentality is why girls walk the other way. It’s a game.
---
Please please PLEASE reinstate your incredible database site! Even without progressive itemization in Classic, your website was the best tool for confirming 1.12 item versions and (more critically for Classic) which patch they each item was added in!
---
you heal and dps as a holy paladin using tier 1 healing set effect. Let me know if you want to know the details.
---
Weird enough I watched this movie for the first time a few days ago, and I don't watch anime at all.
---
PVP is very broad you need to explain what kind of pvp you are doing.
---
Couldn't said it better
---
The music and the art is amazing, its sad but not that heartbreaking. I would recommend.
---
The gameplay had effectively zero lore, with the key exception of Lothar's death scene at the beginning of one of the final missions in the WC2 human campaign.
---
In the game manuals, both WC1 and WC2 had significant amounts of lore and backstory. For example, Garona was pretty definitively described as half-human, half-orc in the WC1 game manual. Human clerics were described as worshiping God (the light wasn't a thing until WC2). Many of the places in WoW were originally conceptualized in WC1 and WC2: Caer Darrow was where the original runestone was stolen from to create the ogre magi during the WC2 orc campaign, and Northshire Abbey was a full mission in the human campaign in WC1. And, of course, many of the heroes and villains of the world had at least some token backstory presented in the manuals, especially in Beyond the Dark Portal. Many of my grievances with WoW and, to a lesser extent, WC3, are actually how they changed the personalities and characterizations of several heroes from WC2 in comparison to latter renditions: Grom Hellscream was a completely different character between WC2 and WC3. The characterization of Kargath Bladefist was much closer to how he's presented in Shattered Halls during TBC than he is in WoD.
---
There's actually a very generous amount of lore from WC1 and WC2, but sadly much of it's been retconned into oblivion.
---
Actually, you can PVP seriously as a Melee Hunter but you will need late gear + tfury. (yes I am serious) Happy to talk more, just let me know.
---
Read up on lore and stuff but go in blind! If you can get your hands on an original game manual from the retail box, read that but no more. It’s just enough
---
If you want to actually win you will spec holy to heal. If the leader says no you can disagree but if they so too bad its too bad. You either want to be there or you don't. Also you ignored the last part of my post. You basically only bring meme specs because raids are too big. They aren't actually useful at all.
---
I know lol, just never cared about it back then :P
---
There’s two lists actually there’s the everything but cthun and the cthun only list haha.
---
They’ve also just put the naxx list in the discord with is 6-7 lotus PER 3 RAIDS PER RAIDER, as well as five stacks of greater shadow and five steams of greater frost protection potions. The full list is on a google doc and it’s daunting as fuck.
---
The community should just pick a PvP realm to be the defacto RP realm.
---
&gt; Tuning damage and health values just prolomgs fights.
---
So what you're saying is that it actively changes the game.
---
I actually had to upvote that even though I never did - actually seems like a good fit though now that you point it out
---
Quality shit post.
---
With every second guild describing itself as "semi-hardcore" whatever that is, yeah looks that way
---
I love these! Nice work.
---
Yeah, most of my vanilla experience was only the last few months before TBC. I think I started playing sometime during the summer of 2006. It was chaos in comparison.
---
...perspective twist. I like it
---
They always been viable, you should explain why they arent!
---
MT BRUH
---
&gt; player know more and play better now days. 
---
That remains to be seen. ;)
---
You are assuming a lot of things to be different between classic and vanilla which I frankly view as rather optimistic at best. I raided in vanilla and there were plenty of "player skill checks" back then in AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Did I miss Blizzard stating that they would change/nerf the raids to where you dont need prep/gear/knowledge/skills anymore? That would be sad face for me.
---
It's not uncommon for players of fantasy games to respond negatively to sci-fi elements introduced without proper foreshadowing or justification. People complained about laser guns in Might and Magic: Mandate of Heaven, people complained about "cats on the moon" in the Shadows of Luclin expansion for EverQuest, and people complained about "space goats" in TBC.
---
Is it a fair criticism? I'll leave that to you to decide. I will admit that I really didn't care for the demon space ships in Legion. I vastly preferred the traditional fantasy setting of the earlier Warcrafts; even Gnomeregan gave me too much of a sci-fi vibe. Goblin zeppelins and Gnomish flying machines were about my limit. With that being said, I do feel that the Draenai have some of the more compelling storylines out there.
---
No.  It fucks up the economy.
---
A+
---
Man I hope people participate in this because i have a hard time deciding stuff like this myself. Would be really interesting and helpful to know if some professions just stick out more on specific classes.
---
&gt;I'm as 100% Classic as the next person
---
&gt;wants dynamic spawns, balance changes and dual spec
---
You cannot be a real person
---
Realm transfers were introduced in mid 2006 during Classic. They were a thing in 1.12.
---
Gay, Hayven is a man therefore op loves men. Fake, No Changes.
---
It's really, honestly not
---
Achievements would spoil to you what's out there. It would ruin the "big scale" feel of the world.
---
Don’t worry, judging by this sub there’ll be more than enough idiots to make sure every Mc pug stops after the tenth magmadar wipe
---
Mostly this except I'll likely troll the greys into thinking I'll kill them but actually won't. For example when on my Rogue I'd open on them (cheap Shot, or even just Sap) to scare them, and then continue doing what I was doing without damaging them.
---
Also, if I see two greys fighting it out I'll probably watch out of Stealth, cheer whoever wins regardless of faction of its fair or if one starts using shit like potions/lay on hands that kinda thing I'll probably just blind them or something to even the odds.
---
*worth noting I probably won't be rogue this time around, I can't stand how slow it is since I've played through the expansions. I like spriest since I'll have utility and be able to heal if needed, but it's apparently the go-to OP fotm spec so who knows.
---
There really isn't a price tag for running a server beside the actual computing power it uses nowadays. It's not like they have to purchase four dedicated blade servers per realm like they used to at the beginning.
---
I think they really do worry more about the PR implications of having a dead realm than the cost to to actually run it. They just don't want to see guides that recommend to "avoid the RP-PVP realm, they are dead".
---
Kargoz is the only guy that makes decent videos about those news. He makes a 3 minute video summarizing the post, quickly goes over if this seems good or bad to him, then peaces out and puts the link to the post in the bio. A real gent right there
---
I really like this idea
---
The people who first made a 5 man group and cleared a dungeon like BRD or ST or a raid like MC did so with early game talents and balance, weird early game stats on gear and no late game items in the game. 
---
Don't you want to see how you stack up against those players? Well if you did im sorry Blizzard changed too much so you can't.
---
Objectively Classic will be alot easier than Vanilla was and i don't really know how i feel about this just yet. It might be ok or it might kill Classic for me. Would a game like Dark Sould be fun if you could turn the difficulty down to easy? I don't think it would be the same game anymore.
---
Are all these small differences from Vanilla there because they make Classic better or are they there because MC and BWL is suposed to be the Classic version of LFR from retail. 
---
BTW all the popular Private servers had Progressive itemization and that worked our perfectly.
---
What class will you be playing out of curiosity?
---
Ngl i think while for prepared people this gonna be easy i can imagine that many might struggle because retail isn't hard either. Like casual people
---
And why is Tfury required? Only because of the damage or is the proc irreplacable?
---
Lack of taunt makes it somewhat problematic on some fights though. Also having a finite threat resource (mana) instead of the warrior infinite resource of rage can pose a problem.
---
I see, never played horde in vanilla
---
as a tank no way. as a dps it is fine if its not a hc raiding guild
---
Dot them up and see if they live. If they do, they deserve to survive.
---
Yeah, it’s not a game known for attracting mechanically good players to say the least. Anyone who played on a private server can attest to how ridiculously bad people still manage to be in this game
---
My guild on retail wow has everyone in voice but it's not required to talk. Half the raid only communicates via raid chat and it works fine for us.
---
I changed my mind on dynamic spawns after I heard about sharding; we wouldn't need it if sharding's going to be doing something similar.
---
Besides increasing the de-buff limit (which would actually be healthy for a lot of classes, even at the cost of increasing the health of mobs in existing encounters), I never advocated any class-specific balance changes.
---
I never suggested dual specialization.
---
Good system or not, it isn't World of Warcraft.
---
didnt have internet also had to get it once i got the game
---
What else would you suggest?
---
Why would you say China three times?
---
On the opposite faction though, obviously. Not to kill them (well, you can) but to kill the endless morons that will follow them around).
---
what's the record atm for a game on twitch?
---
Organized raid will consist of raid leader, tanks and a healing officer talking. Some fights that require kiting or other special jobs might have the Hunter talking.
---
Most members will be tasked with not talking.
---
No Taunt doesn't make problematic if you know how to play as Protection Paladin and there are Offtanks who are going to do the job of swaps when it is required, even tho such Bosses have Abilities which makes Paladins able to Main Tank that Bosses.
---
Warriors in fact have finite Rage and they are in fact Rage Starving unless you base your personal Experience on broken Pservers where they get instant unlimited Rage Gen from each swing , while Paladins Mana can be infinite thanks to Demonic Runes and Major Mana Potions + Innervates + Mana Regen Buffs/Pots
---
Warrior Threats are in fact limited to Weapon DMG and their threats is increased by 10% while slower attacks makes them worthless, Just reminder to you that Paladins threats are Unlimited and they scale from : 10% by White Swings thanks to One-Handed Weap Spec and without suffering slow swings from Def Stance (can be increased by AP and Weap Dmg) , 90% by Holy DMG + One-Handed Weap dmg+Imp SoR (can be increased by SP and Consumes which provides SP) .
---
So you are wrong completely . 
---
Warriors are doing twice lesser threats than Paladins unfortunately for you.
---
You used to be able to ask for a 1-day sub to buy a token ingame, don't know if it's still possible.
---
It is not the knowledge that is going to keep people from clearing Naxx it is the slow gearing process many will face.
---
Oh sure the super try hard no lifers are going to clear Naxx in short order. But these hardcore guilds are not going to be the majority of players
---
 I'm betting most players that want to see and clear Naxx but have RL jobs and families will clear it someday, but the pace they reach and clear it will be very slow compared to what a lot of people in this subreddit like to admit. And that is fine, game wont be going anywhere so people can work on it however long it takes.
---
be brave to be a noob, one of a kind experience to slowly learn wow, i wouldn't prepare as much
---
OP, "Should i try crack?" 
---
Everyone else, "Yes!!"
---
I ignored it because you purported that success doesn't equal attendance, and then went on to say that raids were too big and that you had to bring meme specs because of attendance.
---
BiS until classic release
---

---
People who did play WoW would have loved to exchange places with you.
---
To be able to experience an unfamiliar world again... that would be awesome :)
---
Wouldn't the RP-PVP folks roll on a PVP server rather than an RP server? There's nothing stopping you RPing on a PVP server, but the PVP mechanics are different on an RP server.
---
Yes! So looking forward to gearing up and not having to worry or stress about expansions.  I'll be out there same as you, grinding away with what time I can spare each week. Wish I could try hard but RL just wont allow for it. We for time this time around.
---
I just want to be in a nice guild that raids, and make some new friends.
---
moving the debuff limit doesn't change anything. TBC's prepatch raised it 40 and all it did was mean that Warlocks used up even more of the extra debuff slots.
---
Keep in mind, of the 8 extra slots they added during classic, they all went to Warlocks, because they were and are the best use of them.
---
And completely unrestricted, you'd see over half a raid become Warlocks just for the retarded amounts of damage, zero threat issues, no required healing, infinite mana, all while in shit pre-raid gear and requiring basically zero effort needed.
---
You think 1.12 warriors are flavor of the month? You ain't seen shit if the debuff limit was removed.
---
The only reason things changed in TBC was because of a complete overall to pretty much all specs while adding new powerful synergies and halving the raid limit forcing you to choose your classes even more carefully than before.
---
In Classic, 12-14 of those raid slots are irrelevant what they are as long as they aren't actively screwing up the fight mechanics by blowing up the raid or wasting the healers mana standing in crap or not dispelling on fights where that's important.
---
It's not even fast enough a difference to exclude them if you just wanna get it done quicker, as long as they play well.
---
And debuff slots aren't gonna change a complete lack of mechanical and gear support for Spriests/oomkins/elemental ooming in 1 minute unless they downrank and play harder than the rest of the raid combined, which still doesn't make them optimal it just makes them better than they would've been.
---
Are you really gonna let a feral use a single bleed when any Lock dot is significantly better damage? Are you really gonna use a Spriest when a lock does everything they do, better, to the point that it's significantly more efficient to bring a healer with SW instead of a dedicated Spriest so you can use more of those debuff slots on Lock spells and bring another lock instead.
---
there are no quick fixes and every change ultimately will only buff classes who are already top classes and make it even more likely they'll stack those over an inferior version.
---
Even if you tried to force TBC "Fixes" to work in classic, you'd need entirely new gear, the content itself completely broke during the 2.0 pre-patch.
---
&gt; there must always be a Lich King, otherwise the zombies would start killing everyone.
---
This is what bothers me the most. By the time Arthas gets killed haven't the Alliance, Horde and the Argent Crusade already wiped out most ot the Scourge?
---
Oof
---
sad that the retail babies are so determined to ruin the game by adding cross realm back in, on one hand everyone admits cross realm ruins the community but then they shrug and go "whelp can't be slightly inconvenienced though"
---
No it’s not something to consider.
---
lol this is very well done. +1
---
When I said [the exact same thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/be6xen/dear_blizzard_please_reconsider_adding_rppvp/el3huwn/) I was downvoted into oblivion by the RP-PvP crowd because they didn't like the argument that RP-PvP is not as popular as they think it is, at least not on retail servers - and that's why Blizzard is not going to give it to them. Don't bother arguing with them, they're not interested in rational points, they really don't care about long-term stability or healthy populations on their server. 
---
"What people are playing on in retail doesn't really matter for Classic." - apparently it does, and I am so glad I was right about this.
---
while we're here i don't feel like waiting for a tank tbh, can't we just add cross realm dungeons too?
---
Yeah but 10 can be made by any casual pvpers.  So i did not mention it
---
People are going to have fun time getting those lotuses if they use the original lotus respawn time instead of the rigged pserver one.
---
Nostalgia is a powerful drug. 
---
Like i said, Everquest is still alive almost purely off the back of classic progression servers being released every year. WoW has many millions more nostalgic players that are potential returning customers. Its business and they will do whatever gets players paying subs - at the moment that is making it authentic for maximum nostalgic hype. When everyone jumps on and cries about X raid being too easy or that we all now want Burning Crusade progression, you can bet your ass they will 100% make changes if it will yield more potential profit.
---
Re-releasing old games isnt a new thing, its proven to be a way to extend the lifespan of the game with a lot less effort than creating brand new content (especially when there isnt much left to innovate without making a brand new game).
---
Many, many players will play classic and then reroll on another new classic server 1 year down the track to play it again 3-4 times over to try get those childhood memories.
---
I guess you thought this was funny?
---
This is really great. I remember when I had gotten my rogue alt to 60 and did Onyxia with my guild, when DPS meters were posted afterwards I was nr 1. The other rogues complained that I had been reckless, doing too much DPS and risking aggro. DPS meters in raids can be a cause for drama and problems, and I am not sure how appropriate they are for non-hardcore guilds, except for the raid leader to just look at and not share with the rest, idk.
---
I like the movie American Psycho and I felt this more than ever. I like this, no wait, I love this post. Well done sir/mam!
---
Is this a sign that blizz may be underestimating classic demand and is it a sign that at launch we will see ques and such for servers again?
---
It's not really as imbalanced as it might seem at first. I've written a guide on structured World-PvP a few months ago and detailed [this aspect](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903#advdisadv) but essentially, if I manage to get 40 people to sign up to 2-3 hours for no loot or gold as a reward, I'm already involved and/or at a loss here. 
---
The best thing you can do to win against a group like that is to not get farmed. If I bring 40 people somewhere and all we're killing are NPCs, I am the one who is losing here. 
---
Max levels can easily be killed by a bunch of level 40 players (spells get resisted but melee attacks can still go through) and gear can carry a lot, but so can Engineering. It's true that you probably can't do a 1 vs 5 alone, but it's World of Warcraft - go out and make some friends, 3 vs 5 is totally doable against most people.
---
A holy paladin is not going to be putting pressure on healers, nor will he have two stuns, nor will he be able to kill equally geared melee one on one.
---
Blizzard needed to fix faction balance, but they never did.
---
How? I dont know exactly but just like every other problem in the game since the beginning, try, fail, try again.
---
They never even tried to fix faction balance from my experience.  That was WoWs greatest let down for many people, people want to PvP, people enjoy PvP, but if you dont regulate them, they end up picking the OP faction/class/spec, etc, maybe it is the competitive attitude I dont know.  Personally I cant play the faction that is OP, it feels dirty, Ill take the underdog np.  
---
How would I fix this?  One option I would consider is Free Server transfers to realms where the faction needs players.
---
But maybe Blizz doesnt want faction balance, maybe the way it is makes more money.  Because I can tell you Blizz has people, people who crunch numbers, to rake in millions $$$$ each month, those people are not dumb.  If it would make Blizz money they would balance factions real quick probably.   How difficult do you think it is to send your data from one server to another?  HINT, you are sending your data all the time, non stop, to different servers.
---
Retail is such a joke now. They made it so pvp gear has no affect in bgs/arenas. Apparently pvers get enjoyable item progression, but if you pvp there is nothing rewarding to keep you going.
---
So I assume you have some sort of way to back up your claims of increasing the debuff slot amount "completely trivialising raid content".
---
I still feel like Resilience was one of the most anti-fun things Ive seen in a video game. The person with lots of resilience couldnt really even tell it was doing anything, and the person attacking just got to see their crits do 40% less damage. I get why it was necessary but I never liked it
---
I like this idea but it seems like it's the same amount of work.
---
Alternatively, you could make the all the updated old items change to a "Tarnished X/Y/Z" while the new item replaced it.
---
Either way I think people would complain about it deviating too much from the original game.
---
you can pre-bis yourself, both as tank and dps. As arms pvp. You wont have any issues. aslong as you respecc when its time to raid.
---
Awww bless. You tried so hard . . .
---
I would say this would qualify as a  high quality submission rather than a quality shitpost.
---
They gave me a 1day sub just to look at my characters a few months ago. Wanted to look at all my rare shit. Mounts Tusks of Mannoroth etc etc. didn’t want to actually play tho haha
---
R12 warrior legs is BiS until patch 1.10 but ok
---
ofc it's a thing.
---
haha this is the highest quality shitpost I've seen in this sub.
---
I'm speaking of protection paladins in general. Not the fringe super rare super dedicated cases like you are Killerduki. The regular-run-of-the-mill protection paladin will not do a better job than the warrior counter part.
---
This HAS to be the best high quality meme ever posted in here.
---
This guy is the only person I’ve seen regularly providing useful videos to watch regarding “blue posts” or Classic/Vanilla theories at this point.
---
Everyone else seems to launch some nonsense, half-cocked cam video with no idea what they’re going to ramble on about. This guy produces a fully edited video with detailed aspects, providing relevant information and even uses citations.
---
...sometimes the best things are worth waiting for!

Just change to the relevant realm you're on. Looks like the average price these are being posted at is between 500k and a Mil.

Noobs are always going to be Noobs , doesn't change the fact that Paladin is Viable and Optimal. 
---
When we are discussing about Classes and Specs, we discuss what Classes and Specs could do , we don't discuss Noobs!
---
I have to go... return some videotapes...
---
Weird
---
There's no spec that will allow you to pvp and dps in raids well.
---
You can however play arms and pvp with that, tank in dungeons with that and dps well in dungeons too.
---
Pre-expansion WoW is a complete game that leaves the player with more questions than answers while providing an incredible feeling of accomplishment with every gold earned, level reached, skill unlocked, talent point used, and every rare drop.
---
I was really excited to play with you, too. Oh well. You'll at least have fun on private servers!
---
Fishing from 0 to 352 skill unbuffed in 1 day? 24 hours? How?
---
So would something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSMzefQNA_AdDAA) suffice for getting pre-BiS, and I could tank all content pre-raids? Would it not work as an off-tank in a raid either or would I absolutely have to change?
---
&gt; Most members will be tasked with not talking.
---
I wish this could be stressed more.
---
but these legs are bis no matter from what patch they came from right, so buffed or not does not matter  ? its the 1% hit you want ?
---
within 10 hours even. I know exactly how insane the questline is, but I do have time and the knowledge. Just need to know when the release date is to decide to start pre-forming a guild...
---
What I meant in the comment above was how much patience is required to do that single winterspring quest 840 times exactly. Yea grinding the Nozdormu rep is pretty much as bad but.... well there's no "but", i'll be staring at silithid for weeks, listening to the sounds of them dieing
---
you mostly have to listen as dps, healer and tank may need to talk during a fight
---
Except for short progression periods in each new raid tier, I always spent a lot less time raiding doing it in hardcore guild than I would as a casual.
---
It's always more fun to raid with an entire raid of people that have respect for one another and thus will put the effort in to their character.  Wiping all night and failing is not as fun as killing challenging bosses.
---
Huh, is it? I didn't know, well shoot. I thought them being the same ilvl was good enough(assuming rated), we talkin trinkets and azerite traits?
---
\+A
---
I'd buy it twice if it was orcs in crocs
---
Utterly cringe, think im gonna puke.
---
If you cancel your Blizzard channel then you won't get all the damage for it.  Pretty straightforward like one would expect.
---
You cant raid with that specc in 1.12. But you could in vanilla i was arms tank in vanilla, but 1.12 changed Mortal Strike debuff from Medium &gt; High prio. so arms is not a viable raiding specc anymore
---
TBC was when they abandoned some really bad ideas, like the entire paladin class design.
---
I'll still never understand why people pretend like Warriors being the dominant class in the game is good fun.
---
Now I have a question about this. What is the driving factor that makes people want to play classic? Is it the nostologia, because if so I won't enjoy classic as much because I have simply never played it therefore nostologia factor would not be present for me. OR is it simply for the fact that it was just a solid good game? OR a bit of both.
---
I have played Maple Story and even if they brought back 'Maple Story classic' I would most likely not play it because they game was just not well designed back then even though I would give ANYTHING to go back in time to early 2000 to experience it again as a large contribution that made the game great  back then was the community. Nostologia is a tricky thing.
---
Hahaha. Genius!
---
If you arent leading or playing a key role(tank, healer) then most guilds would prefer you didnt talk.
---
I think you overestimate people
---
0-300 unbuffed. All the +300 stuff will take more time but I have done 1-300 fishing in a day plenty of times.
---
I love the sound of that
---
Dude you are a god amongst men for this.

"And there's nothing you can do about it," the Troll whispered.
---
What's the point of this post? Just scroll past it. No need to stir up hate.
---
Yes.
---
I've never grinded a single level in vanilla wow. You can definitely level without doing so.
---
That said, leveling exclusively by questing does involve a fair bit of walking around. And at endgame, you will probably have to grind not for levels but for materials.
---
Your choice but even if its MC, pugging it just seems like setting yourself up for a shitshow, ppl leaving mid raid etc. ppl not knowing wtf to do.
---
Why not try and find a good guild that runs it, make some friends etc. 
---
Playing Classic like Retail with its anti-social LFR pug system just sounds depressing.
---
Vote yes to late term 156 month abortions!
---
Who needs damage meter, heal meter is where you need to look at!!! \*waves ecstatically with her branches\*
---
Awww dont worry little timmy, you can play on your 5000 pop private server while the big boys play wow classic
---
Vanilla isnt crack. Vanilla is top grade 100% pure chinese heroin.
---
&gt;How would I fix this?  One option I would consider is Free Server transfers to realms where the faction needs players.
---
You're thinking to small there. People wouldn't be tempted by that. 
---
What would work would be forcefully transferring all rank 12 and above from the over populated faction to a server where they are underpopulated every couple of weeks.
---
Bit of both, I think. There's definitely a large chunk of wonky mechanics and bad design involved, mostly related to like half the specs in the game, but the gameplay itself I believe is actually genuinely good.
---
Not making any if those changes
---
It is, heck most of communication back then was just the raid leader or class leader writing to you in text form.
---
Tanking might become challenging though if you cant report instant statuses like you lost aggro etc. but dps and healer should be fine.
---
Hey man.   
---
I really appreciate it when people like you try to see it from both perspectives. I don't think I've ever typed as much as I did yesterday though. As I mentioned to another user - it's a shame that for whatever reason, the community is split between pserver players and non pserver players negatively. Instead of learning from one another, people tend to think that's it's too black and white and that only one can be right and not both.
---
One key element that people seem to forget is that the experience that the players who haven't been playing on private servers are going through when classic releases is an experience we've already been through. The "mistakes" that we're seeing Blizzard and the majority of the community are about to make are mistakes that we too, also made,  during our time on the private servers.
---
Essentially, what's great about vanilla is the replay ability that it offers if done correctly, because usually, the more depth a game offers the more replay ability it offers too. 
---
What we saw on previous private servers was that the game became boring or a waiting game much like retail WoW is when aspects like these weren't taking into consideration. That's not to say the game weren't great - but it could just be better. And it could, because as time went by, you'd come to learn the little things about the game and how much they actually mattered in terms of creating the feeling that we're all craving to accomplish.  
---
The top 5 things you're craving and expecting from classic will not be the top 5 things you expect from classic once you've experienced it.
---
The big problem with World of Warcraft Classic is that everything is mapped out. Everyone knows what each class can do, what gear is the best, what leveling route is the best, what strategy for killing bosses is the best and so on. So the depth of all of this is already gone out the window for a lot of us and it will be the case for many others too once they've done it. And that's when things like these changes ends up mattering. 
---
The game will not receive content updates and thus, the only way to keep it alive once the nostalgia trip ends for most people is to make sure the replay ability is there. A change like this takes away from that replay ability, instead of adding on to it. 
---
There is a reason that almost any person who's been active on the private servers throughout the years are heavily against this. It's not because we're some elitist jerks who wants the game to be how we want it to be because fuck everyone else - it's because we want the game to be how we all want and remembers so that the game can continue to be played for more than just a year and a half by people like you. 
---
It's a game we love and it's a game we want to stay active.
---
Most private server people are going to be playing this game regardless. These changes doesn't affect us nearly as much as it affects you with the exception of PvP items being so strong that it ruins a core aspect of the competitiveness in the game. We want you guys to stay after the nostalgia trip ends - not leave.
---
I could have gone over your points to my post and addressed them individually, but that's what I've been doing yesterday to a lot of people and I feel like it's become a waste of time and a bit of a circle jerk. Down the line anything is subjective and instead of telling you you're wrong, I'd rather tell you that this is what happened to us during the private server experiences - and we're afraid it'll happen to you now.
---
Due to the 1.12 patch? Why does this make it easier? In some cases it makes it harder. While you have 16 debuffs slots on boss, the def cap for warriors is much harder to reach. So it goes both ways.
---
And as for the items in the game, close to none of the items that will be in the game on launch is nerfing the game. Spread the info, people don't seem to understand what the latest blue post meant.
---
Molten Core was never hard tho.
---
except for the big dick lock who accidentally put on his full shadow resist gearset for twin emps.
---
I will enjoy seeing this post sore
---
That mage dps was all wands I bet
---
Upon release WoW classic will probably be the only popular MMORPG that is still legitimately an MMORPG.
---
&gt;Also just to clarify, WOW is basically the current WOW without patches/content updates etc. , correct?
---
Yes basically this. However current WoW feels like a completely different game.
---
Imagine 40 people trying to converse. Unless you're playing a leader position you ~~don't need to~~ should not talk!
---
Then again you won't "finally" get into MC. You can clear it in green, you will prob do it as soon as you hit 60 if you're not the tanks.
---
Do what you want to do
---
Uther, grant my bubble earth might!
---
I never looked at this from the TBC perspective. Great post.
---
Yeah meme specs are useless as fuck beyond filling a spot. If a real paladin applied afterwards the rettard would have to respect or get replaced.
---
You can buy tokens from the character select screen now
---
Sharding means that if there is too much people in a certain area, they will be split in 2 instances of that area.
---
Like 2 Elwynn forest with 75 people instead of 1 Elwynn forest with 150 people.

Crisp AF
---
Well I was a broke uni student, but I remember getting together some funds to go snuggle one in town and hurry back for raid night 🙃
---
yeah, the people who manage to have just reading 3 paragraphs with minimal commentary take 10 minutes and 7 seconds for the extra ad revenue
---
Chinese though?
---
For me, my prom date was my gift. Nice for you tho dude!
---
Exactly, so just make it a bit more challenging by having the old talents. It also means that players will have to figure out new specs which is a welcome thing for team private server. It also removes our advantage a bit as we can't rely as much on our experience.
---
WSG legs is better pre 1.10
---
Slightly cringey, but I'm happy for you dude.  Is she a Troll, Orc, or Cow?
---
Undead is against the law iirc.
---
supposedly their heroin is off the hook.
---
as dps or heal you don't need a mic at all. For tank it's kinda necessary.
---
This scene always makes me lose my mind and is possibly the funniest thing I've ever seen
---
Never did I think I’d see an american psycho and classic mashup but I’m so glad I did
---
Tell that to my guild that was stuck on it when Naxx came out back in the day. For some reason we could never get more than halfway through. I blame guild leadership though. That guy was a clown.
---
The only people who were going to do this would be playing in groups who understand what's going on and accept/expect it. I don't really agree with the decision tbh.
---
\+15 agility on gloves in stage 1?
---
For many of us, it is not just nostalgia. I never played the Warcraft RTS games. I was more of a Star Wars Galaxies player at the time WoW launched (MMO that pre-dated Star Wars The Old Republic, SWTOR, and was far superior IMO). I ended up playing WoW since all my friends and my flatmate were doing so at the time. 
---
I miss the socialization, some because you want to and a lot because you have to. I tried playing retail again recently. Made a point of getting my toon to max level and into some of the dungeons. Man was it boring. And along the way I met no one, made no new friends, did not find a guild to join (I was looking for an invitation after making friends with someone in a dungeon or something, not just accepting the random invite someone would toss to the whole zone of un-guilded people), and was so bored with it all that I quit again. 
---
In Classic WoW, things are difficult. You can do plenty on your own, but a large chunk of the game you will need a group to do it with, and you will need to communicate with them. The classes and their specs have fairly defined roles. One of the things I really enjoyed in vanilla and look forward to in Classic are the group mechanics. I loved running dungeons, with how the classes interacted with each other to accomplish their goals. Modern games don't seem to have this, retail or other games entirely.
---
So yea, there are things that appeal to me which have nothing to do with nostalgia. There's more details and tidbits than the stuff I mentioned here, but this is already getting long.
---
Hi, /u/Jesuissimpledesprit
---
That's a required response for a 4chan post but it's out of place here.
---
That's the problem with playing nelf, you already have the coolest alliance mount.
---
logs never helped a guild, but they killed many!
---
I whole heatedly agree. Now I want nothing more than to pay my respects to TB in game.
---
Why would you resub to look at something that might be wrong when the information is readily available online
---
didn't realize the pattern was an AQ drop. fixing, thanks
---
Sure, but the descriptor doesn't fit vanilla wow.
---
Wow, this is fantastic!
---
The reason why they kill him that fast is partly the 1.12 talents and the fact that furies do monster dps where in vanilla they pretty much did tank dps until 1.9 but you still had to bring like 6 of them to off-tank. Mages get 6% hit from their talents which they shouldn't do until Naxxramas, druids and paladins have almost double their healing throughput as well as blessings lasting longer and being more powerful. Also just the fact that everyone and their mother is fully flasked up and world buffed to the max. This will hopefully change on Classic.
---
The values used on Ragnaros are copied from guides that were written during vanilla. Using combat log extracts like the dudes from BigWigs did. They are very accurate, you even lose durability when attacking him, something very few even knew about.
---
That was changed in WotLK.
---
So I never got to try MC back in Vanilla as I hit 58 as the portal to BC opened, but I’m such a bad player you better believe I’ll do my best to make sure MC is harder than it should be.
---
Just keep in mind there will be way more people who have never been to MC playing than you’re imagining.
---
While I mostly like your idea for the purpose of a smoother item progression which won't confuse people, I doubt that Blizzard would be willing to add new items to the game. Not only because they're aiming for as few changes as possible, but it would cause some other minor issues. For example, should Bonereaver's Edge and Bonereaver's Blade look the same? If so, people won't be able to visually distinguish between the two when both items are in the game, and how you look is an important aspect in Classic since it indicates how strong you are. On the flipside, if Blizzard decided to distinguish them visually, they would in effect have to give that new weapon a new look, which they absolutely won't do.
---
Hurckle durckle that's why I'm asking before I do??
---
...pretty sure cow is also against the law
---
It honestly took me way too long to adopt this playstyle. Took me way too long to learn about keybindings too.
---
Even if it is the exact same 1-300 it’s still a stupid thing to do. “Hurckle Durckle”
---
You can't out-DPS Paul Allen. His water mark is pristine.

---
You must be blazed right now.
---
if i could i would give you an award, this is QUALITY
---
Molten core was nerfed several times during the span of vanilla, to make progression easier for late starters. But the major difference is the class revamps that happened to all classes during vanilla.
---
Have fun paying 15$ and wasting even more time for information that’s readily available. You are a moron on a level that goes beyond the average I see on this subreddit.
---
The way they're doing it just skipping to endgame. Might as well just release naxx on day one if they're gonna give us the gear for it right away.
---
"Have fun paying $15 a month to play a game" 
---
Tf you going on about lol.  You must be looking for r/Warframe
---
Yep and everyone's gonna be chasing those blues and not just the people who did their research and knew better.
---
For me at this point it's the fact that I'm aware of the fun that can be had in the game. Nostalgia is also a part of it, sure. I want to experience places like Teldrassil, Ashenvale and BRD again. But I also want to have new adventures, I want to group with new people from around the world, I want to tackle different classes and new challenges, and yes, I want to melt faces and MC people off cliffs.
---
I still remember the fun I had when exploring vanilla for the first time on my priest, and I'm hoping you'll find it fun as well.
---
Things like getting killed by Sons of Arugal in Silverpine, like stumbling unto Dreadmist peak by mistake, like getting Shadowform, like running Jintha'alor, like seeing Anubisaths in Camp Mojache, like soloing an elite disonsaur in Un'Goro and having an epic drop off of him, like fighting through BRD... those and more were amazing things to experience for the first time.
---
You'll also have to move back in with mom and dad. And go down to have dinner when your mom calls you, interrupting the dungeon/raid/whatever group activity you were doing.
---
“Was thinking of resubbing just to start mapping out to level it quicker”
---
Big yikes
---
ah i see, in classic they wont be thou, unless i grab exaulted before r12 that is ?
---
That’s awesome. I hope to be gaming in my 70s. 
---
Y’all should form a guild like the &lt;Geriatric Brigade&gt;, good for finding your comrades.
---
I know a few of the older generation playing but they definitely aren't the pvp server type, I don't know if they'd be playing classic either tbh. I should probably ask.
---
"Wtf do you mean people practice things before doing them?"
---
A true SP fan.   You have my respect.
---
Hey **guys**, its your boy RollingHammer here.

Today **we** are going to read the latest blue post on the Blizzard WoW Classic Forum.

For those who don't know what WoW is.....*one eternity later*

Now lets get into it. This post was made by XYZ who is a WoW Classic Developer, for those who don't know what a developer is....*one ternity later*

Don't forget to **SMASH** that **LIKE** button, **SUBSCRIBE** and click this button here and click that for previous videos and buy some of my **MERCH**, it's 40% off with the code *iamanidiot*.

I genuinely couldn’t come up with replies this stupid if I was going for that. If you genuinely don’t understand anything that’s been said your existence is a lot more sad than it already seems.
---
Well I didn't expect to witness such a good meme waking up this morning lmao
---
You'll quickly find a guild that understands!

It's really simple. Collision is clientside.

Imagine having 420 in your name,  attempting to berate online over a video game,  for them trying to speed up a long process.  
---
Lmfao.  You a 14 year old girl?  Cause you're being a real drama queen.
---
Thanks Frost &lt;3 
---
Can't wait to share these spots with some people and hopefully make some friends along the way.
---
To be young
---
Imagine not understanding the reference isn’t even to weed. Try a little harder dumbass.
---
The only person being a drama queen is you for getting that upset over someone trying to save your dumb ass 15 dollars and time. You are genuinely fucking retarded
---
This is the one
---
There's honestly not that much choice for wlock. Engi+Tailor all the way. Engi is a must for pvp and pve if you want to perform better and tailor is a must for bloodvine set whenever it's out. You can, ofc, use something else instead of tailor before zg patch, and obviously engi is not for leveling.
---
I'd go: leveling = 2 farming (mining, skinning, herbing); after leveling is done - drop one, pick engi; after zg is out - drop 2nd pick tailoring.
---
Very nice!
---
Isn’t Might of Menethil better than CA?
---
Not sure you can ever go oom spamming lvl 1 wing clip. Don't think there's any point in using higher levels since the damage increase on wingclip is negligible.

Do you genuinely think this reply makes any sense at all? Reread it, rewrite it and try again brainlet
---
No mate you're already moving this discussion into random stuff. So like I said, I'm done.
---
I love these videos Frost, but I have one question. Aren't the drop rates from vanilla unknown to private server developers? Arn't they just basing them off guesses? 
---
Because if that's the case, wouldn't that make all these types of guides obsolete for classic?
---
If they attack me, I fight back. Otherwise I don't interrupt my leveling or farming to PVP unless I'm ranking, in which case I'm not leveling or farming, I'm just searching for people to kill.
---
except noobs are 80% of the population, you get 2 noobs in a row
---
Shoot, why pay a monthly subscription to play a game if you can just look up all the gameplay online.  Just trying to save you money, man.  No need to be so upset.  
---
Genuinely curious what your life is like.  Go on internet, find random thread and just lose your mind like a child lol.
---
Yah they were definitely lost ones. There was was some swamp of sorrows and one by the dark portal if I remember correctly.
---
It will be much faster than that, as you know what is comming and can basically start from day one to prepare (which the most hardcore guilds will do). And alot of the players have cleared it lots of times on private servers or even retail vanilla, so they do not need to learn the fights, only to get the proper gear and consumes.
---
Nice.
---

Interesting level you chose there. Out of all the ones you chose...

most of the croud that will be those players from 2005 , who never touched WoW in the last 10 years.

“Why would you resub to look at something that might be wrong when the information is readily available online” was my original comment, doesn’t sound like I was losing my mind does it? But it bruised your puny little ego and you were a dick in your reply, probably because you realized you sounded like a complete fucking moron in your post.
---
You’re making these shitty equivalencies too like calling this dogshit plan “gameplay”, it’s a genuine shock to me that people like you exist in this world.
---
I mean... It IS World of Warcraft. What WoW has become. It's not Classic WoW.

This happened to me when I was playing my mage.  I was in blues, but a fire mage and asked to do Kazzak with the top guild on the server.  Again, I was new to raiding, listened, was told to stay alive, so brought heal pots, those little pods that gave mana and health, and just kept fireballing Kazzak with timed heals (bandages, included), mana pots, focus...    
---
The main tank posted the dps, and asked why a mage in blues could beat out the guild mages in BWL gear.  To be honest, I was happy at being recognized for doing great damage, but man oh man, I was not on the lead mage's "invite to guild" list. :)  
---
This was back when we were all just learning, and some of us loved being fire mages for PVP and PVE.  In dungeons, I was known as the hot damage person (I never ran dps meters because it slowed down my PC), but I also knew to play defense (sheep or nova), and how to pause and bandage myself.  Until I met "the tanks", it was hard as many said... "Do not aoe the elites!"  Meanwhile, I aoe'd all of Sunken Temple, could do all the \*original\* number of spiders in LBRS with pauses, bandages, nova's and blinks.  Wayyyy too much fun.  I loved that damn mage to death.
---
You nailed it, bro. And that's why I love Classic Wow. You CAN level alone, but if team up, its a much smoother experience. This sort of "forced/not forced" social aspect is what made Classic Wow for so many of us, and formed so many relationships/friendships. This aspect can never be overstated, and good lord I cant wait for this.
---
I hadn't read it yet so it helped me. And you could just fast forward.
---
except the current client no longer is 7.x but 8.x and I doubt they keep two API versions alive. My bet would be 8.x
---
I'm 54 and I  was there in Vanilla on a rogue as well.  It was PVP server (Thunderlord), wouldn't play this game any other way.
---
this is pretty awesome, do you sell these?
---
It’s called , a dps alt
---
We had a couple healers and dps that didn’t have mics and it worked perfectly for us. The trick is getting people to STFU during a 40 man.
---
\+A+
---
"Look it up on Google!"  Shoot, almost like that information could be wrong as well lol.  Hence trying to ask someone who might have played vanilla.  
---
"Just trying to save you money when you could just find money on google" 
---
Wouldn't resub until confirmation.  You're literally saying, "why play the game when you can just find the pathing online."  Why just play the game when you can watch someone else play for free.  Why waste money on video games?  Why waste you're time showing how weak your mental is on reddit?  Piss off ghost.
---
&lt;Over the Razor Hill&gt;
---
&gt; There is not a single rule in Classic WoW that says "This is how you have to play this game." Your statements are factually wrong. No amount of repetition ad nauseam will change that.
---
Maybe you should actually read what I said instead of making up what I said.
---
&gt; The contrast between the classic devs and the live devs is huge.
---
Fairly confident the contrast is activision involvement
---
Once classic becomes a money bag activision will milk the fun out of it
---
Okay dude I’m kind of over this conversation, you are genuinely retarded. Resub and hope that the information is still relevant while you don’t even have the recipes for the important things I really don’t care and you’ve proven yourself to be both a moron and an asshole, good luck in like dumbass.
---
So because a change has already been made more changes is fine? LOL!
---
You're arguing that smashing my windshield is fine because u already had a flat tire.
---
No clue XD
---
I mean feel free to say no or cancel trade. Idk if it’s common enough of a problem to be annoyed by, &lt;.&lt;
---
It's certainly the one into which the most effort was put, but yeah it's damn near perfect.
---
That's fine, I can see people wanting the old spell interactions back for a while - I'd just really like for people to see what the cost of it is, and open their minds to this being changed in the future.  
---
IIt
---
As can I see it from your perspective my friend! If LK were to have had the gameplay and mechanics that we had in vanilla, I truly believe LK would have been an even more superior game.  
---
I hope that Classic WoW and (undoubtedly) the Classic expansions that follow it remind Blizzard what made those games great. If they learn from all of this, we could see the retail game take back the throne it once had as a true MMORPG.  
---
See you in Classic friend!
---
Luckily we have a fleet of low effort Youtubers catering to this niche demand
---
$1 ring but guess it's the thought that counts
---
Same here.
---
This is sweet. But I still feel like a dope for not really getting raid talk. Been playing since 2005 and have never been raiding level or big into co-op play so this stuff always goes way over my head.
---
yeah no rogues are good i guess
---
Most of these don’t break anything down. At best they flat out read the post, then proceed to state some blatantly obvious facts about said blue post. Nothing new under the sun, nothing learned, 25 minutes wasted.
---
Great job OP. Very nice.
---
Forgot the healer check :p
---
*American Raider*
---
I do agree that this idea is good to prevent one item being BiS for too many phases that can be acquired in phase 1, it's still more work and maybe there's a simpler solution. Things like bonereavers edge &amp; the breastplate mentioned in the podcast weren't good in the early phase and no body cared about them til much later, and in classic they didn't hold the Boss title for nearly as long. So what all of these outliers simply didn't drop til later phase to limit their BiS time frame instead? It would feel the same as vanilla because you would only chase/desire these items til much later. Because even with progressive itemization, players would still be interested in the future BiS items even before they were good and that doesn't really match vanilla since no one knew a head of time and many of these items were DE'd.
---
Although some items that were there in vanilla wouldn't be til much later, it's not that inpactful because no one wanted at that point anyway. It's seems like the best solution to me to make classic feel more like the original and it may require less work for devs if they only address the few outliers. Plus it keeps it simple for the players since items won't change that fits blizzards stance.
---
Coming from someone who leveled to 60 as Holy. Please, **dont't**.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
It is abjectly one of the worst ways to level, unless you are thrilled with the idea of leveling through dungeons, and exclusively dungeons. If not, stick with Ret or Reckadin
---
&gt; impossible to target
---
Is there no tab-targeting? That's all I remember
---
/r/meirl
---
Remember the draenor MC event? Yeah that shows how awful players can be
---
&gt; not fair to reward r14 players with gear that's far better than anything available
---
Very, very subjective. In reality they have put just as much effort in as guilds who get to Naxx.
---
From what I read it's just the actual changes they did to the items that is not going to be recreated. All the items will be in the game starting as they were with stats based on 1.12. They will still be introduced during their appropriate phase though.
---
Yes, you will have to go back to Teldrassil to do your hunter quest at 10.
---
Not really no at least not as Holy, I'd say the better duo pair with a Warrior is a Priest. 
---
But Paladin is a great duo leveler with Warlock, Rogue and even Mage.
---
Damn, that's what I thought. I don't think it's worth it, I'll be joining him at level 10. Thanks for the answer !
---
"I haven't read the blue post yet, I don't know anything, here's an hour of me talking."
---
Once you do your hunter quests, you're good to go :)
---
With how long Phase 1 will be, and how surprisingly quick it is to level as a Paladin, if you just go Ret. You'll be able to cap both long before Phase 2 arrives.
---
I love to get the highest OH on fights I know we'll crush. Just so I'm the best at something!
---
Alexensual is a fucking moron and so is TipsOut, but to think that TipsOut might actually be a bigger moron than Alexensual? Wow. I'm genuinely impressed by how stupid TipsOut really is.
---
So for whatever reason people try to click on you.   Some players won’t but you would be surprised how many this works on. 
---
Also if you are with a group you are extremely difficult to target.
---
Actually only recently came across his channel due to getting back into WoW and he’s by far the most useful and enjoyable person to listen too, looking back at some of his vanilla vids really gave me nostalgia and brought back some good memories!
---
Collision detection was client-side in vanilla. They just edited the game files to remove some walls after the 1st boss.
---
People would also edit the files for Stratholme and create a tunnel leading straight to Baron. Shit was nuts.
---
This is the best meme I’ve ever seen in 10 years of playing WoW
---
What movie is this from? The meme itself is hilarious tho
---
Nost was a long time ago now, and it was free which is a pretty big distinction. Nost was also full of the hardcore and dedicated fans, as I alluded to as the only people who will be playing after a year. Your casual vanilla fans who didnt go out of their way to find and grind through private server after private server will drip after boredom, that's a simple matter of fact with EVERY game in existence and disagreement is just plain biased denial. The same way WoW subscribers would have slowly dropped down to fractions of retail amount if they never kept releasing new content. Casual people move on, and even the dedicated eventually have something that makes them do as well even if it's not by choice or boredom, we all have lives outside thos after all.
---
This is absolutely flawless. Top work my man
---
I understand, but I think you underestimate how many people are going to absolutely nolife WoW Classic. Especially streamers and their ilk. We're talking playing 14 hours a day.
---
Every time you, Asmongold or anyone else with a YouTube channel and an opinion say the words "quality of life" with regards to WoW an RPG element dies. Every. Time.
---
Don't fuck WoW up with your Dungeonfinder/LFR and whatever other "convenient" bullshit the masses want. Vanilla doesn't spoonfeed you content, and that's the way it should be.
---
Sorry for the salt, you hit a sore spot.
---
Class is only one factor. Almost as important is if the toon is an alt or main. Also if used for PvE or PvP.
---
For sure example gathering professions are more popular with alts. Engineering is often chosen only for PvP.
---
ThIs SuBbReDdiT hAS ToO mAnY mEmEs
---
I do. No problem.
---
It seems most people are annoyed by not having stuff when they start a character so they enjoy a handout of bags or other items or some money.
---
I'm just trying to show there are more than one way to play and enjoy the game and some, like me enjoy it differently. It seems people took offense. ;)
---
the problem is that dmt gives so fucking much. most classes can farm something for ~£30-50g/h. dmt is 100-120g/h. it kinda forces you into rolling a hunter alt if you want to be effective.
---
I felt like I just watched a guild officer meeting.
---
[This is what you are looking for basically](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-blacksmithing-guide-1-300/)
---
No need to pay $15 when you already have an optimized path for you laid out. If you want to pay for a month and dink around, be my guest, you can do whatever you like to do. However, personally, I wouldn't throw away $15. There is soooooo much information out there for classic that you can easily search for just about anything. 
---
If you really want to see classic stuff, you can always log into a private wow server and see that way. No paying for anything, just downloading their launcher.
---
Depending on what you want to do at 60 life is really quite nice. There is a big difference between PvE (non-raiding) and PvP however. 
---
If you want to play 5-man content don't expect to be able to join as dps as you don't bring any CC or enough utility to fill the support spot. Not saying it's impossible but it's just not as easy.
---
It's quite easy to tell the PvP warriors apart from the PvE ones and if you are competent and can play the class, and not the spec, you can hop between roles without a problem. You work up your name and brand and soon you'll have no problem doing whatever you fancy.
---
very nice editing
---
They haven't heard enough support for RP-PVP servers. To counteract that, the best thing to do is launch a campaign, flood their twitters, the forums, and fill out petitions that players want a RP-PVP server at launch.
---
Things were different back in the day.
---
Around 50 is where you can start looking at doing preraid quest chains for attunements and preraid bis items. You can also start farming the good mobs and grinding areas that give you rep, if you’re just grinding anything to try to get through 50-60 as fast as possible you’re doing it wrong if efficiency is what you’re going for since you’re going to have to do all that shit at 60 anyway when you don’t get so for it.
---
Get max level and hide in a cave somewhere giving random enchants to lower levels who pass by.
---
Haha what a whiny thread, some people just love to shit on others I guess. Do I smell jealousy perhaps?
---
The first time you put on shoulders too
---
90% of the time on this sub min maxers get shit on by people who can’t accept that some people like to play like that. Then they say that the min maxers are elitists shitting on people who just want to play their own way but in my experience the opposite is true.
---
What you could do instead until they launch is reach out to them via twitter, forums, and other social media informing them that you want a RP-PVP server at launch.  The more vocal we are the more likely they are to reverse on this decision.
---
Before I get into what I'm gonna say I want to say I respect you and I like your tone. You speak from a place of clear knowledge and your take on how this affects PvP is *entirely* accurate. I'm not trying to be combative, if I come off that way I apologize.
---
&gt; That's probably the best way to do it for PvE.  
---
I have to disagree for a few reasons. Is it the EASIEST way for blizzard to do it? Of course. Is it the most reliable way for blizzard to do it considering they say they only have the 1.12 db for information? Of course. But this is absolutely a bad way to go about this and effects PvE and PvP player habits in a major way. You've covered how this will effect PvP mostly so I won't be touching that really.  
---
&gt; It just limits the initial pool of items to such an extent that every other boss you kill drops nothing usable for any class.
---
Yes this is correct but the same thing is true of the new loot table as well. If we changed the stats on items it would incentivize people to actually do different content that was otherwise a waste of time like you said, this is annoying but good for longevity. Let's just take a single example of an item that got buffed that will now make it so many characters now actually see potentially LESS content. Prior to upgraded stats on Savage Gladiator Chain (epic chest from BRD) most pre-raid warriors had less options to get a chest piece than before this buff. Warriors basically had to get one of the following:   
---
- Breastplate of Bloodthirst (Quest reward, Everlook, requires UBRS and Mats).  
---
- Ogre Forged Hauberk (Tribute chest, DM-North).  
---
- Deathdealer Breastplate (Vault of the seven, BRD).  
---
- Cadaverous Armor (Several bosses, Scholo).   
---
All of those options are around equal, a warrior can go get any of those chests and be comfortably pre raid bis. After the buff to Savage Gladiator Chain however it becomes far and away the best fury chest until later raid gear. You can expect to see warriors spamming BRD arena as a result of this from the very first day they hit 60 and they will neglect all the other instances where only a chest can drop for them. This epic BRD chest is way too powerful to pass up in it's buffed state and easily outshines pretty much every other option to the point of them being "dogshit". Having a defined way better item, like the new itemization is going to do a lot of, is actually going to make us see less content because the best items are way more clear cut.
---
&gt; It'll be a gigantic shitshow for the competitive PvP scene
---
This is PvE too tho that they are fucking with. That insane discrepancy between available weapons from raid and PvP will make many players who are hardcore raiders focus on PvP to get r14 just for the weapon so they can push competitive DPS or Healing. The motivations of PvE rankers in PvP battlegrounds where their sole incentive is to rank and gtfo is not always the most healthy environment. Community enforced honor caps, Win trading, account sharing, r14 becoming impossible to attain for those that aren't invited to the discord or don't have friends in the group, all of these things that were already a problem will be magnified by people who will stop at nothing to be BiS. They will dominate a bracket and as soon as they rank, they'll disappear with their loot to never step foot into a BG again. This is bad because now all of the best PvE players (especially melee) that want to be BiS will need to also get R14 which makes PvP and PvE intertwined in a way that necessitates PvP for min/maxers.    
---
Another major problem that they haven't addressed here about PvE is that the gear we originally had to take down ragnaros and nefarion were the non upgraded "dogshit" versions of the items in vanilla. Are they going to increase the difficulty of Ragnaros and Nef to scale to our new improved gear? MC and BWL already aren't the hardest instances when you know the strats, is this insane overgearing going to make MC even more of a ROFL stomp? Has the difficulty of basically every instance except AQ40 and Naxx effectively been nerfed due to lack of progressive itemization?  
---
I hope blizz realizes this and tunes up mobs just a tad bit to maintain at least a little bit of initial difficulty, but I think we know that isn't happening.  
---
Anyway thanks for reading and have a good day.
---
TL;DR: it 100% will effect PvE in bad ways as well to do it like this.
---
This sounds awesome. I’m in.
---
Join a battleground, type "/e has marked you as AFK. To avoid being kicked from this battleground, type '/AFK not'.
---
Sometimes did this when i was bored grinding honor - you would usually see a few people getting kicked from their afk-status...
---
Yea, generally the trinkets from the new raid are far superior even after getting nerfed. As well as majority of the pieces with the ideal combination of azerite traits are better from PvE. 
---
Also add to that, that it's easier to get higher ilvl gear from PvE than PvP.
---
American Psycho.
---
No, they don’t
---
Not quite 57 but you'll find a lot of players in 30s/40s given the lag between when vanilla was played and now
---
I know the guild me and some others are building is almost exclusively 30+ because we're all Vanilla vets who were at university or working already when we played
---
Can't wait to come back either :)
---
PvE servers 😍😘🤩🤤👌🏻👍💯🔥
---
They’re completely pointless
---
Oh man, even more important to take a cursory glance at some guides. Funny story, the first class my brother and I played when we started in real Vanilla was rogue. He stuck with it and I re-rolled early on to a mage. But we didn't have a clue what we were doing, especially with our talent choices and how we wanted to play rogues, so we ended up just choosing the talents we thought were cool for rogues and ended up going subtlety so we could be even more sneaky and roguey. There's nothing wrong with that, except after levels 15-20, it just starts taking so long to kill mobs. Our ambush attacks started doing less and less overall damage, and that's what we were specced for. So our damage out of stealth, which is what you'll be doing 90% of the time, was awful. Then one day he got so angry with his low damage and whispered a random level 60 rogue for help. Dude told him to go respec to combat rogue, and find some swords instead of daggers. Instantly made the class fun again for my brother because he felt as if he was actually doing something. And then when he hit level 60 he changed it up and went back to being a subtlety and assassination rogue. If you want, I can give you a really quick explanation on why being a combat rogue was so efficient just so you have some idea what I'm talking about. 
---
One thing to note, your spec's efficiency for leveling isn't as important if you're always grouped with someone. But I still think it's a good idea to learn a little bit about what you're going to play.
---
American Psycho. One of the best movies of all time imo. Definitely give it a watch.
---
&gt; they really don't care about long-term stability or healthy populations on their server.
---
Except that is exactly what they want for their server and forcing them to splinter and adopt other servers from the beginning instead of giving them the home they want will only cause the servers they are on and may adopt in the future to be less stable decrease their populations.
---
This game is piss easy bring all the rets you want .
---
on the private server i play and i am not allowed to name the mc record was 21:44 in bwl gear. they split up in two 20 groups and meet at ragnaros at the end.
---
Everyone hopes so. On the unnamed servers everything stacks and bosses end up at like 400 armor. It's so stupid.
---
Naxx is a lot more attainable than Rank 13.
---
Could always go Dwarf hunter, because they are so darn cool looking and easier to start together.
---
Well they don't have jobs, and youtubes monetary policy is now 10+mins plus videos you can see what its all about.
---
That's interesting... I always imagined those pesky rogues being 14 year old kids.
---
Private server content simply isnt that hard. They arent tuned or scripted properly
---
Especially with a raid full of people hardcore enough to be playing for 14 years and endlessly grinding away on a private server.
---
The goblin and gnome steam punk has pretty always been part of the series since W2 but the dranie jumped the shark.
---
Private server droprates aren't soooo off from the originals - the original data is fully available on archived websites like original allakhazam and thottbot
---
e.g. this is the droptable for Burning Exile elementals in arathi on allakhazam as at 22/Aug/2006:

---
I want me and my friends to be known as a bunch of trolls tbh
---
Last I heard (years ago) blizz doesn't care about multiboxing as long as there's no automation, and 1 key press = 1 action for all windows.
---
When you right click report someone they are unable to use chat functionality for a period of time. Which means in a instanced PvP game you would be unable to call out incs or coordinate via in game chats. That's the edge; disabling enemy communication to increase your chance of victory. 
---
As far as their motive, obviously its to win. It doesn't matter if its a 15 year old game, people would abuse it because they are able to in order to rank faster.
---
 Obviously there are work arounds with discord and other services, which an organized PvP group are likely to have. Against pugs it would be much more effective. That's a side topic though. We would have to approach this concern as if players wouldn't supplement, because not everyone will  so we would narrow the scope to the least common denominator. 
---
Why wouldn't some people abuse it if its possible? Just because the majority won't, is that good enough to not look into it? 
---
I guess I don't understand the pushback your giving me. It obviously has the potential for abuse. Why not consider putting this concern on the table with the other items you listed? 
---
You and I both want an amazing Classic experience, right? This is how it happens; through voicing concerns and possible issues that could potentially effect gameplay in an unintended manner. The way I see it, this mechanic has a high risk of being abused.
---
I knew a guy that used to whisper “Dwarf” at every non-Dwarf priest he saw and then put them on ignore. He was a complete tool. He could never understand why all the night elf and human priests used to get invited to PUGs and he didn’t despite his clear superiority.
---
Anubisath Warhammer bro. Or if you wanna be early, a Felstriker. When those two pro s go off at the same time it's absolutely nuts.
---
I mean, does it surprise you? He thinks Vanilla dungeons/raids are harder than Retail.
---
This is just what happens when a playerbase gets older. A lot of people dont have the same amount of free time as when they were younger so they want to make sure their time played is actually giving them progress. /r/2007scape has the same things going on.
---
My favorite right now is madseasonshow. That guy have great information, interesting videos, nice editing and his voice drops my heartrate substantially.
---
Makes sense that someone cant SHOUT at you (or at any mob) while *silenced*, I guess.
---
If you play 5 days for an alt to get 60 you're wasting 2.5k gold if you're only pulling 20 gph, most classes can do better than that. Leveling an alt isn't really the efficient method unless you want to generate mountains of gold super long term, the time you use to level the alt is honestly enough for what you need for the pre raid and pre ranking time tbh
---
people still speedrun mario 1 which was released in 1983
---
Now it’ll be 70-year-old ‘Get off my lawn!’ dudes.
---
Come to think of it, can rogues use Wirt’s Third Leg and shake that about?
---
Me too, but our Alterac Valley win ratio would greatly improve :D
---
Boss hoss tank. I'm fixin' to run my own MC/BWL pug and make all dat money
---
New talents already make the trivial raids trivial. The hard part of vanilla raiding is coordinating 40 dudes and the grind, the raid mechanics aren't hard.
---
Hi, /u/JackRid
---
Isn't it the case with fire mages that the first mage to tick an ignite gets all ignites from the raid added to his dps or something along those lines?
---
I should note as it comes up in every thread about broadcasting; Multi boxing, broadcasting and botting are 3 seperate things and I am fully aware of the differences between each. I am talking about broadcasting and not multi boxing.
---
Very nice! Love the clip
---
Hi Frost, thanks for making content for this game I love your videos (I've even begun watching your videos from 3 years ago). It would be great if you could cover some good ways to make money as a group? 5 man, 3 man, 2 man, etc? Do you think the gold making potential as a group is more than solo? Or is solo grinding gold better?
---
Getting enough hunters to tranq the rage will be the hard part, or warriors who can rotate shield wall.
---
This is an S+ tier meme on god
---
The gear there isn’t replaced until 40’s unless you engineer/tailor
---
i mean when your dps rotation is literally one button then theres not much to brag about is there lol
---
All Paladins have access to BoF. Blessing of Kings is the talent specific buff, 11 points in the Protection tree.
---
In true osrs fashion anything they do better be polled or optional in some way. I expect they'll fuck it up after naxx though.
---
Love your videos man &lt;3
---
Oh you will be! The gaming bug is a virus, it is with you forever :) Love the guild name haha
---
Lol they gotcha with "NO CHANGES!"
---
My anus wiggles when classic is mentioned.
---
So yes. I am ready.
---
When was the last time you raided? Constantly got different frost mages bragging who got first in a raidnight after all of them just spammed Frostbolt.
---
I agree, but my philosophy on this subjet has always been that, I'm gonna be looking at a character's butt for hundreds of hours, better make it the best butt possible. And also shadowmeld on a sidenote.
---
That I'll have a life by then.
---
I have just a bunch of "rules" that I follow myself. The 2 major ones for myself are to never kill low levels and to respect 1v1s (respect 1v1 is situational at 60 tho).
---
As for leveling I generally don't engage fights myself, however I do obviously fight back when being attacked. 
---
Other than that I never attack low hp players. If I play mage I usually sheep them first to let them regen, then kill them once they're full hp. 
---
Overall it's all a matter of respect tho, so it really depends on who my enemy is.
---
hahaha, love the pic that conjures up :)
---
That's when it originally came out. The quest wasn't around when mc first came out
---
tbc release. tbc &gt; classic
---
Problem with zero sum is that people won't bid on slight upgrades because they want to wait for better drops.
---
Lean?
---
Making progressive itemization a thing in classic is not Vanilla, you didn't try to get gear that would get better later on in Vanilla. It's a private server gimmick that has no place in classic.
---
I understand the frustration... I havnt found a youtuber yet that makes good quality classic content. It just seems to be these 10 minute "I already know this since I'm on reddit videos" reading over an article blizzard posted.
---
I love how being "tryhards"means being babyraging teenager that yels at you in discord. 
---
Like there is no way a raid full of "tryhards" could be chill and fun lol. This sub hates on "tryhards", "elitists" or "p-server babies" (all names i've seen used on here lol) and according to them everyone of those guys acts the same. Its ridiculous.
---
Came here to say this. One of the best memes of all time in all categories.
---
Once I model swapped the campfire into a full Dark Portal.
---
I used it as portable stairs for exploration, I was smart enough never to abuse it or to get caught doing that shit in BG or instance otherwise I would have been banned for sure
---
&gt;doing too much DPS and risking aggro
---
Isn't that what KTM is for?
---
What totem quest is peak vanilla
---
You know i always got that mf thang on me
---
It doesn’t get any better than this, nicely done.
---
 Nice meme
---
Plenty of socks you can never have enough socks
---
hey thats me on a meme  
---
I made it to the internet mom !
---
Get him a potty box like the one in SP.
---
When you don't have those young twitchy reflexes anymore, stealth and stunlock help out a bunch.
---
ooh i see, fair enough
---
Hopefully they're wise enough to understand theres 2 separate audiences to capture with classic &amp; live, and keeps the division clear.
---
Im a good person. I leave lowbies alive and I don't attack people who don't attack me. Except rogues, all rogue must die.
---
Put me in the screencap /s
---
How it's average? You will be using it till naxx if you are unlucky in BWL (still didn't get since raid released in pserver currently I'm player on). So yeah..
---
The system they are pulling from does include a bonus if you have had an item on your LL and not won it. So I guess that's another bonus to attendance, in addition to the flat attendance bonus. 
---
Everything is made public the day of the raid. This makes sense to me, because otherwise it would be really easy to not submit your list, wait and see what everyone else put, and try to game the system by ranking things as low as possible while still winning them to get as many drops as you want.
---
Game mouse. One of the nice ones with extra buttons on the side. Quitting their jobs is pretty intense, wouldn't recommend it.
---
Actually bizarre. If you only ever cast 1 button then whoever did more dps didn't do it through skill.
---
Most dungeon bosses will drop 1 blue BoP when levelling. Stockades is a notable exception. Only 1 boss has a chance to drop any loot. lol. Not sure about RFC either. 
---
I reckon you'll get 5-10 BoE blues over your 1-60 journey.
---
Pretty much every BoE blue is worth something in classic.
---
You'll often keep a blue item for 10 levels or more since they can be so good
---
Resilience
---
Arenas (death of world pvp)
---
Flying mounts
---
Ehhhh
---
Now give me kara tuned for classic and you got yourself a deal and a boner
---
Genuinely asking:
---
How were the other two logs better than the first?
---
Total DPS on the first log was like 2.5K higher than the second, and the max DPS was almost 70% higher than their max. Lowest DPS on the first log would also have ranked fifth highest on the second log.
---
By all accounts, on paper it looks like Raid #1 far out-parsed the other raids.
---
Am I missing something?
---
Get the guy's rogue binder he posted couple days ago.
---
Warcraft3 cinematics, 4 hours long on youtube, if he doesnt like it, then he wont like wow
---
Why why?
---
I didn’t think this sub was capable of such HQ meme.
---
Hey! Thanks for the response! 
---
Yea I know - but they’ve saved a butt tonne of money for it 😂
---
So!I forgot to mention, he actually just spent over $3000 USD buying a new desktop, keyboard, tower (with all customised components, that he then assembled himself) mouse headphones etc. So gear wise he’s pretty sorted 😕
---
I hope TBC and WoTLK never happen.  
---
I hope small adjustments are made to the loot tables and phases and fresh servers to released.   
---
TBC and WOTLK killed Azeroth.   
---
(I know they won't release content for classic, Hyjal, Uldum, CoT, but I wish they would)
---
The thing is you are not taking into account that this is 2019 and not 2005. For many people wow was their first mmorpg. People are not new to the concept of an mmorpg anymore. They are gonna blaze through the content at multiple times the speed they did in the past simply because they know what to do. So even at the same content release pace the percentage of people that clear naxx is going to be way higher.
---
The hardest content in the game is not meant for everyone to clear. If someone does not have the time required to invest in order to clear all of the content then that's too bad for them. I can understand your frustration but there is nothing to be done. The rest of the world cannot slow down to your pace. It was the same for me back then but i am not complaining. 
---
The logic of making "the remaining vast majority of players" happy is the logic that turned the game into today's  easy shitshow kid game. You can be a casual, not clear naxx and still be happy. You did not quit back then, did you?
---
What happens after naxx is a different story.
---
TBC for sure.
---
Interesting how opinions can differ :p
---
I quite enjoyed Resilience/Arena's/pvp specific gear
---
Flying mounts killed world pvp in my opinion.
---
(I'm also hoping for a TBC release at some point :p)
---
😂 I’ve thought about this. I also considered adult diapers 
---
But I don’t think I could bring myself to do it
---
The original world of Warcraft guide books like the dungeon companion and the master guide. Might even be useful while playing since it’s been so Long since classic.
---
Silly me for assuming the “server environment” desired by people that chose RP-PvP would include Roleplay.
---
What exact server environment, are these people you’re speaking for, seeking, in that case?
---
Unreleased vanilla content that got absorbed into BC or not at all due to time constraints.
---
That’s actually a great idea! Maybe with my face printed on them so he doesn’t forget about me 😂
---
What if i told you that it's obvious you are trying to get attention from a known streamer ? You could clealy ask this question from anyone and get a useful answer.
---
Is there really more than the one person that posted here worried about people auto accepting quests?
---
No changes
---
Amazing! I’m going to google that now! Thank you 🙏🏽
---
downer if you're a virgin neckbeard.
---
hope i kick the habit and quit this game for good. haha
---
Halloween. I dont remember when that came out but everyone wearing jackolantern helmets would make me smile too much. Can you imagine if they went full monty and had the headless horsemen mount (obv not flying of course). So halloween and brewfest are my two favorite in game holidays personally.
---
I don't think they've said anything about multiboxing in relation to Classic specifically, but their general stance is that key broadcasting is perfectly acceptable as long as one keypress leads to one key input per window.
---
It's not like "trivial level achieved" and there is no further way to make it even more trivial.
---
I love to have as much confrontation as i can during my lvling adventures.
---
There have been a few posts about addons in general, that example just stuck out.
---
6 weeks? LuL. Try 4 months.
---
We will, don't worry.
---
Speed running a single player game that can be completed in under 20 minutes is hardly similar to running a 40 man raid to being first once every couple years.
---
Speedruns work because you have full control. You do not have full control over 39 other people.
---
All the autistic min-maxers get bored and leave, the game goes through a renaissance of people doing mass pugging and enjoying all sorts of different classes and specs, away from the "optimal" bullshit. You start seeing all Druid or all Paladin raids trying to do different content
---
Overall bliss and genuine enjoyment of not just the game but the actual people who play it.
---
By keeping 1.12 items, we are deep in Changes Land. A small edit to health/armor/resist to compensate seems like an attempt to make it more vanilla than less.
---
Is 36 too young for your crew? XD
---
Sadly you may be right
---
&gt;This is my biggest concern. 1.12 talents.  
---
1.12 items.  
---
1.12 nerfs.  
---
&gt;If they don't retune, its gonna be kinda trivial.
---
The mechanics of these early raids were never very difficult, but 1.12 talents and items makes them a complete cakewalk. At least it will finally confirm for everyone what a great player they are today compared to how bad everyone was before.. :)
---
Tbc in a classic sure sounds tempting aka a continue of the lv 60 content.
---
Tbc in general is very tempting also.
---
54 here too, started with a rogue on pvp server - but soon switched to hunter/lock. Still on pvp server but more interested in warriors nowadays - loves the sound of a successful block 😊
---
Molten Core on Nostralius was way easier than it was in retail. I'm fairly sure resistances didn't work properly at all.
---
How else can the world see my giant green mohawk?
---
lol, 2.5k is nothing. thats lionheart, edgemasters, devilsaur and mount. and then you haven't even spent a copper on consumes. if you don't level a hunter alt, you will have a hard time raiding as a warrior.
---
I remember my guild, 2nd best on my server, struggling for weeks on bosses Rag-&gt;Cthun.    
---
It was tightly tuned due to the items we had.   
---
These 1.12 items + Knowledge are going to make it a curb stomp.
---
Agreed. It’s not practical or realistic. Back when I was doing Naxx/AQ40 in classic we usually have 20% of the raid flasked on progression. It’s not practical or realistic with lotus spawns as they were.
---
its better that way and then u can go straight to goldhain with him. and leave that trashy dwarfen zone behind :P
---
Has to be paired with Alterac Cheese and Junglevine wine to really be OP :o
---
Nothing. this is Classic, not whatever crazy idea any off you can come up with.
---
I love me some Improved Kick on my rogue. Amazing talent.
---
Madseasons videos are one of the best there is
---
&gt; forcing them to splinter and adopt other servers from the beginning instead of giving them the home they want will only cause the servers they are on and may adopt in the future to be less stable decrease their populations.
---
How exactly? They're not a significant portion of the playerbase enough to matter to the overall RP or PvP servers whether or not they're going to quit because they don't like the missing PvP or RP element respectively. 
---
If they cared about the health and stability of their realms they'd take a long hard look in the mirror and acknowledge that they's not that many people interested in RP-PvP. They make a lot of sound but [this petition](https://www.change.org/p/blizzard-what-many-are-trying-to-achieve-is-getting-an-rp-pvp-server-when-wow-classic-releases?recruiter=false&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial.pacific_post_sap_share_gmail_abi.gmail_abi) that's actually been spammed in every Classic WoW related Discord server and forum that I know of for the **past month** - barely has 800 people signing it. If we're generous and say that all 800 people are RP-PvPers and retail brings twice as many numbers, it's barely enough to justify the existence of even one server. Just because they write long walls of text and make a lot of noise doesn't mean they have any actual numbers. 
---
You can even take a look at [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e7nMh8IaH5mNZ7MOx2it8MF7ULYdCIT0VqO6ubaUDq4/edit#gid=0) of most guilds that have announced their intention to play on Classic. There's only 9/236 guilds that are specifically tagged as being RP-PvP, split between EU/NA. I feel like most people talking about RP-PvP are just talking theory out of their asses and aren't really interested in playing on an RP-PVP server.
---
I'm not arguing out of spite because I really don't care about RP even in the slightest, I just don't want these people to make threads 2-3 months down the line after all the tourists leave and play something else that their server is dying and Blizzard "needs" to start making merges and other stupid things.
---
So you're going to invite everyone and expect to get something better than a PUG raid ?
---
This kind of guild never get passed MC (I mean the 2 giants at the entrance ;-)
---
WH OMEGALUL
---
That's what i look forward to in Classic, in Retail a guy like that could still get into raids cuz of LFR but in Classic word would spread quickly on the server that ppl were cunts.
---
Not really. As a warlock I really enjoyed being in control of my own bis. Solo farming Sunken Temple or doing start live runs for my bis felt WAY better then waiting for a raid drop only to lose it to someone else. Epics and raid items are overrated, bis outside of raids was one of the best parts of vanilla.
---
How do you sign up to potentially get an alpha invite?
---
I’m not upset at anyone, just trying to point out that a variety of opinions at play here and that we shouldn’t generalize.
---
I agree with you, I think we should give people as much information as possible.
---
That people will stop asking what will happen after naxx.
---
Somebody needs to crosspost this absolute gem of a meme
---
tell us if its good enough to kill some time :D
---
Classic TBC. Vanilla has always been my go-to version of WoW's peakness, I simply just love how the game is played with the old mechancis and all that. But I played through the entirety of TBC, raided everything, got my epic flying, etc etc.. and I want to do it again after Classic. The first phase with Karazhan will be freaking amazing.
---
The reason I don't want more content for Classic WoW is simply because:
---
1. It goes against the purpose of this entire project. Classic was never about adding content, creating new gear that never existed before and buffing raids. The entire project is about re-creating the experience we had back in 2005-2006
---
2. Adding content to Classic WoW will alter the entirety of Classic and might make it unrecognizable from what we know it to be. Do people really want to play a version of vanilla WoW where you end up having TBC stats (becuase it will happen, if new content arrives there has to be a purpose to clear the raid more than once and that is better loot).
---
3. Modern judgement. Like Ion himself said, the second they start making changes to Classic that was never a part of vanilla WoW.. that's when the entire project loses its identity because with Blizzard's modern judgement comes Retail WoW and with Retail WoW comes modern mechanics, changes to gear catch-ups, talents and specs might be buffed or nerfed, etc etc. This is not something I think will be good for the game at all.
---
I miss the old days with all the guild banter. I miss being excited to raid and stuff, all the old stuff you know?
---
When you say it like that, it sounds like nothing but playing an enhance shaman, ret paladin or moonkin can be fun.
---
How is it nothing if you're getting some of the most expensive gear you can get plus an epic mount?
---
I gave 2.5k as a low end estimate, if you get 2.5k and play the AH you're good to go, if you know how to do that it's better than leveling an alt
---
Because trash is Overrated.
---
&gt;all classes
---
Shamans are still waiting for their vanilla revamp.
---
Go in more or less blind. You can research classes/lore/whatever before picking your character if you feel like it, but it's not necessary. But just because you go in blind doesn't mean you should play the game blind. If there is stuff in the game you don't understand it's a good idea to look it up. 
---
The point is that you don't have to prepare much by researching. But researching while playing the game is still a good habit if you want to become a better player.
---
You must turn on war mode to attack or be attacked by somebody of the opposite faction, even on PvP servers.
---
Nobody cares how long it will take to implement. The reason for not doing it has nothing to do with how long it would take. Why do you keep talking about how quickly you could do it.
---
People who roll moonkins and ret paladins rely on others to carry them by playing more viable classes. That's just how it works.
---
Now that doesn't mean you aren't allowed to play what you want ofc, but don't try to say you're not being carried.
---
That's not much praise though.
---
How can someone just quit his job ?
---
What does he work and doesn’t he have responsibilities? 
---
Not judging but I am curious , also a huge wow fan
---
Wait, retail easy?
---
Fun fact: I got so used to keeping questgivers on my right side from having a bigass owl on the left that I still do it out of habit today. Bawk bawk
---
I was getting xp it was garbage. thats why i only played a couple gotta keep stuff authentic lol
---
Yeah - stuck out to me too in that I found it ridiculous and petty.  Like who the hell cares about the .1 second somebody else may save form not having to click the ‘accept’ button on a quest 😂
---
There's a difference though, isn't there?
---
In PvE, there's literally an entire world you can do instead.
---
In PvP you're limited. There's only going to be one instanced PvP zone for months.
---
I wouldn't mind for an opt-in queue though. You want to wait an hour to do a BG? Fine, I'll have cranked out 2-3 WSGs in that time on the  crossrealm
---
We both get what we want, and I'm 100% betting you'd pick the crossrealm queue
---
49 here and am hoping to reconnect with Gen Xer’s and older players when I get back. I was a stay at home dad with my baby girl during vanilla,
---
Looking back life would have been a lot easier without a girlfriend in college. So many times I was forced to play poker with her friends while I was dying inside from missing a raid.
---
If they are concerned with making the experience as similar to retail as possible then you're 100% correct, a decision to keep 1.12 items and talents means you need to buff the content to equalize it. The amount of dps/healing people could do at 1.12 was dramatically higher, and proper itemization on tanks and fixing talents made tanks better too.
---
Amazon games...no thank you.
---
Even if they weren't a bunch of tax-evading dickhead who treats his workers like slaves, i have no inclination to waste even one minute on a game that will likely turn out to be a microtransaction-powered (read: pay to win) PoS, no matter how shiny the graphics.
---
Yeah the group of people who wants progressive itemization is probably laughable small compared to the group that would be annoyed as shit to have to look up every item that drops and see if it will be useful at some point in the future.
---
Maybe ret is an extreme example, I don't know.
---
But there are plenty of sub-optimal specs that are easily good enough but for the 0.1% of guilds
---
Slight correction: Not just tax-evading. They're getting a 150 million dollar tax rebate this year on their 20 billion dollars of profits, which is a lot worse then just not paying anything and leaving a zero balance.
---
yes i am going to invite everyone day one because there will be literally no standards to go off of yet what
---
I'm not gay but I'm very attracted to your boyfriend right now.
---
thats the reason why guilds that look like no fun allowed exist. it is not enough that 1 guy wants to get the record but 40. as someone who is currently playing on a pserver i think this discussion is overblown. there are many types of different guilds on my server and it is not hard to find one that fits you. just like you can enjoy mario 1 however you want you can find people to enjoy raiding however you want.
---
No, u replace it with ashjretul wich give higher damage and slower speed. So rokdelar is good for mc, hence average.
---
&gt;Do you want classic to just be left alone with no more content patches?
---
This exactly.  
---
The biggest problem with classic content-progression, was that things were sped up too much around the time AQ was released. Both AQ40 and Naxxramas aren't mechanically hard raids, but tough numbers games, so most people did not get to experience them before classic became irrelevant.
---
I'd be perfectly happy with joining my characters in "MMO retirement" in an unchanging classic world.
---
If they proceed to TBC one day, so be it...but make that on separate realms.
---
100%
---
So we have done it before just quit and go travel for 12 months. I think the biggest thing for people is the fear of what ifs. Financially he has planned for it and a bit more. And luckily for him he has no debts etc to stress about and his apartment was rented knowing he’d be leaving so it’s month to month. But from experience, you can always make it work.
---
We just don’t care much for jobs more experiences, and that’s something he’s planned for for as long as he remembers so for him the value of that is higher than his job. I think it’s kinda cool. Very few people follow through on things they say they’d like to do.
---
You still have to get Pre-raid BiS, only now most of it will actually be replaced by the gear you get from completing higher difficulty content...which kind of makes sense.
---
One thing to be aware of is drop rates will be inflated on those sites for creatures that frequently drop nothing such as elementals. The early database collector addons couldn't detect empty loot windows.
---
You certainly did need other players - seeing the same faces day after day was great - also, knowing which people to avoid was great too, no  playing with an idiot and never seeing them again like it is now.
---
Not sure which server we will end up in, but will post nearer release, would be great getting an old fogies guild together haha
---
Im not seeing reasons against doing it if the development time is non existent
---
People get their biz lists already from websites and forums, people who dont look up bis lists will be unaffected as they never would have known anyways
---
Content will be made far more challenging for current content than it other wise would be
---
No reason to keep the bad parts of vanilla.
---
I remember finding the green helm grinding trolls in STV. Life just doesn't get any better than that.
---
I know I'll be doing Scarlet SM for orbs once crusader drops.
---
That’s kind of inspiring.
---
I am self employed and do my best everyday to earn as much as possible and that can be stressful. I don’t even allow myself to just play wow for a few days for fun.
---
Interesting view of life for sure you and your bf got there.
---
Mallie :D
---
Sharding is a deal breaker for me, I prefer lag and bad performance to not seeing everyone.
---
Hey Frost, wouldn’t your kill speed/gold per hour depend on your gear? In the video it looks like you are in full epics farming. Can you do a comparison with blue gear and epics?
---
Look at the number one DPS'ers in each log.
---
Now i really want a card with my dps printed
---
3-5 most nights, 5+ on days I can manage it without letting my life slip.
---
Don't act like every shaman and priest is on the ball with using their toolkit.

* Overtuned raids.

TBC was a great Addon, insofar as it was better than everything that came after. It also had great 5man content, the zone design is second to none to this day, and it's crafting was SUPERB.
---
But compared to classic, it had so many godamn fucking problems, **all of which could have been prevented with less lazy design decisions**, it was ridiculous.
---
# Classic &gt;&gt;&gt; TBC, hands down.
---
GO IN BLIND!!! I’m so jealous and wish I could unlearn everything.
---
I'm wondering if they will consider it unbalanced and nerf it for classic.
---
You mean. You see no damage on the meter so you never know whether the paladin is afk or not.
---
I think you should play apart until level 10 or so when you join at westfal. No need to play together from level 1, as it'll be only the first hours of gameplay, compared to the infinite hours you'll play at leveling and 60
---
If you want the stealthy rogue feel while leveling id go with a sub/assassination combo to boost Ambush damage. The goal of the build would be to guarantee boosted Ambush crits to start all fights. This should put mobs at half health after your opener. 
---
If you planned a leveling route focusing on low armor mobs and blue daggers it could be effective.
---
It has too many low effort memes
---
there's a video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrJqWag8cqs
---
I'm not sure -- this was back when BWL just opened.  And remember, if you were a 'raiding mage' the spec had to be frost. I was the only fire mage in the raid.   
---
When I raided MC and Onxyia as a fire mage, I kept up with the damage meters, not that many bosses in MC were fire resistant, and a few scorches on the bosses made them so much easier for damage.  If/when I had to switch to frost, I simply used an "increase magic damage" flask and kept up fine.  Granted, anything with +frost on the gear, I immediately passed.
---
1 night a week...
---
It honestly depends on what shift I'm on at the time. If I'm on nights I'm cool playing 5 hours on my off days since there's nothing to do at 2am anyway. When I'm on a days shift, shit maybe 2 hours a day?
---
If every DPS in your raid was elemental, moonkin, ret, enhancement shadow and feral, clearing content would be *very* hard.
---
Thus, the people who play these specs get carried when grouping with mages, warriors, rogues etc. That's just how it is. But if that doesn't bother you then ofc you can still choose to play it, there's no rule against it.
---
Well fair enough
---
If you roll mage and expect to do top damage from just casting fireball you'll be laughed out of the server.
---
BOOMKIN IT IS! SEE YOU IN NAXX 40!
---
Wait...you're saying...people would...no, you can't be serious....can you?
---
You mean...people would play a game...for fun?
---
Come on now, that' can't be right!
---
First of all, I'll say nothing. Classic is an important preservation piece, important to the history of gaming. Vanilla needs to exist in perpetuity as a historically significant work of art which helped define video games as a medium. Classic is kind of like a restoration project, to help preserve that history. And thus far the developer talks at events have indicated that Blizzard shares this vision for Classic.
---
But, assuming we MUST get more stuff... fill out Azeroth. I don't really want post-Naxx content, I want the stuff that was planned for Vanilla but never made it in; I want the empty zones on the map filled out; and I want the loose plot threads cleaned up. Some mix of content, more mid-to-high level levelling zones, more mid-level dungeons, etc. But all done to fit Classic - no level cap increase, no new playable races, no new systems.
---
Azshara Crater (and just finishing Azhara in general), Gilneas, Mount Hyjal, Karazhan, Uldum, the Blood Elf zones... these all had some related content and plotlines in actual Vanilla,but were never finished or fleshed out. Then there are all those empty spaces in the world, the spaces between zones that got turned into your Twilight Highlands and such in Cata.
---
There's plenty of space to flesh out the world we already have, rather than just relocating half the game's population to a different world or continent and leaving the old world deserted and meaningless.
---
Anyone who needs a team of dwarf priests, really is terrible at the game.
---
You mean the 5-6 people who don't know how to run away when they are the bomb? Yeaaah.
---
I dont know.  Some kind of x/x/30 build.  Can you swap gear during feign death?  If so you could pop up with a full melee gear set and bonk them lol
---
This is so refreshing.  I was expecting to come into this thread and see a bunch of 26 year olds complaining about being dinosaurs.
---
That's why it's absurd to me isboxer is allowed and hasn't been mentioned
---
People are legitimately complaining about not having to click accept quest but then when it's "well you can click one button to talk to the NPC on 6 characters and accept the quest with another, not to mention cast 6 spells at once with 1 button" it's not an issue?
---
It's never been a better time to get into wow.
---
Blind. Don't ruin a single thing.
---
Back in the TBC-WotLK days Blizzard decided that strict MMORPG won't be profitable in the long term, they probably watched trends and things like that and decided to slowly change WoW into another game. It's hard to say whether it was a good decision or not. They definitely alienated a good chunk of old playerbase and they definitely won hearts of many people who did not enjoy old game iterations. After all they are professional game developers, not amateurs and the fact that 15-year game still has million of subscribers and still #1 MMO subscription game means that they did good enough job.
---
For a fire mage, no, it's not one button. And if it's a fire mage, and the only fire mage in the raid, it's like a damn mini game trying to keep ignite up.
---
1. Great videos! Keep 'em coming.
---
2. What addons are you using? Is it a full UI addon that changes everything? Or is it a set of addons? I love the black bags and stuff.
---
Cheers
---
My claim to fame during BC was getting Armani Warbear.
---
In Vanilla, I like Anzu. I believe that’s vanilla
---
Then I'd find out what race/class he's gonna be. Each class, race, and faction has a really cool like sigil or coat of arms type thing. You can then find an etsy store or something similar for that. I personally like made gifts better so if you're the crafty type you could do a couple things.
---
Buy a basic color shirt matching his faction, get wax paper and cut the symbol out with an exacto knife then spritz watered down bleach on the shirt so it dims the rest of the color but leaves the logo emblazoned.
---
Or find fabric with the sigils/logo on it and make him a nice blanket. Either one of the knot edge throws or sewn quilt like thing for him to cover up with while he plays.
---
Are we getting the nerfed version of Molten Core from the start? Is that confirmed?
---
What kind of class revamps are you refering to? Did these impact the PvE greatly?
---
I don't want difficult content. Enough of that in retail.
---
One of the HQG mods recently mentioned waiting for Classic, so naturally I assumed this was in HQG - did not expect High-quality content in this sub
---
For alot of players there is value in going back to relive the challenges of Vanilla. Players like that would be off put by a Vanilla easy mode. 
---
patch 12 talents, 16 debuffs, optimized stats on gear, access to patch 12 gear earlier. I would not be surprised if you quantify all that early game Classic will be 50% easier than Vanilla was. 
---
14year old me had it 33% harder when he cleared MC. I am really not happy if that turns out to be the case.
---
So yea 20% hp/dmg buff wouldn't be bad but still meh...
---
Pfft, rogues are the only class that get base threat reduction. You guy start at .5% base threat. EZ mode
---
Wow. A lot of players are going to play more than 3 hours per day. Seems Classic will be the true hardcore game like in the old days. That's interesting...
---
I’ll be 36 in 5 months, so not quite there
---
That show is way too addictive
---
Sounds very good, but I really REALLY want to keep the mount inflation out of classic at all costs. I know, the rewards coule be anything, and it would feel epic to complete it, as was the true spirit of vanilla ♥️
---
Me too! He’s the best.
---
I thought about that, but they’ve discussed it and it’s pizza they want. 😂😂
---
I’m a chef so I was gonna make all their fave foods and make freezer meals for them. 
---
Why is this so hard. Maybe I should just get him socks with my face on haha
---
F R E S H
---
I work nights now 11pm to 7am. I'm switching to afternoons 3pm to 11pm just so I can play all night undisturbed 😁
---
Obviously someone wasn't decursing.
---
A really nice desk pad
---
Hmmm good idea! But I made him a Juventus shirt for Xmas... so I’m hesitant to get him another shirt. But maybe a sports bag or something like that - I will investigate race/class/faction. Thank you for all your help
---
This is the major reason I'm debating rolling a class I never really played in vanilla. Sure i knew what to expect against my opponents, but discovering the class as I level will be as close as I can get to the feeling I had at vanilla release. But I've also played all the classes I really loved in terms of lore and aesthetics.. so there's that.
---
What do you mean? Hen we can finally play the game !
---
In the description: "Classic WoW is getting released sooner than expected. " 
---
Source??? lol
---
Great to see older folks gaming too! At 29 I hope I'll have the same drive for gaming when I'm 50+. Keep it up guys!
---
Karazhan tuned as a 20man raid and reduced power on all the loot could be cool. Just remove or reduce Midnight dropchance to about Baron-is droprates. 
---
Properly tuned tier 4 items with options for the different specs could also  be a lot of fun. And they look amazing aswell as a cherry on top.
---
What do you mean I can only upvote once???
---
The real number 1 is the non-tank that needed the least healing.
---
Hell no, it's not worth the effort.
---
I mean, the Owl is awesome, but I'll get a cat to do more DPS. And he'll be tanky enough for leveling
---
Thanks for the suggestion! Is that the thing that goes under the desktop and keyboard etc, like the whole lot?
---
“Can’t wait to keybind life bloom to my ddr mat and dance my way to gladiator “

*laughs in frost mage ice barrier*
---
Wouldnt most people say that battle grounds actually ruined wpvp? I dont see how arenas made it any worse. Most people left wpvp as soon as wsg and av came out. And in tbc they even put pvp objectives in each zone to encourage wpvp. I definitely attempted to instigate more wpvp in tbc than I did in vanilla after battle grounds were released
---
For 5 man money making it is a solid way. Plus you can disenchant the blues that drops, and the last boss has a chance to drop Recipe: Flask of Distilled Wisdom.
---
Yes a big comfy nice looking one
---
The one who’s willing to save the most dkp gets it first. Then the second one and so on. Naturally the one who gets it first will have spend more on it. Always seemed fair to me. Also encourages attendance, even when you don’t need anything from the raid anymore.
---
Thank you!
---
\&gt;  If I run lvl 60 dungeons as a bear tank, and roll on healing cloth, will I piss people off? 
---
If you were healing a dungeon, would you be pissed if the tank rolled need on your healing gear?
---
It's an irrelevant hypothetical because many people tend to care about meters
---
&gt; If I run lvl 60 dungeons as a bear tank, and roll on healing cloth, will I piss people off?
---
I have no idea what you're talking about bud. I was alluding to Tips making half a dozen videos saying itemization would RUIN the game.
---
Check out Goth 2, StormX druid etc. Tons of great vanilla vids from the last few years, the skill increase is massive
---
I do NOT want to go to TBC, but some aspects from it like a retuned Karazhan as a 20man raid and stuff would be so cool! I basically want more stuff in Azeroth, not Outland.
---
Brilliant mate
---
I was just looking at my recommended.. Tips talks for 24 minutes about a 5 paragraph post, that literally only 1 sentence mattered in, and the rest was justification. 
---
Disgusting.
---
I'm not 30s, gonna play, hopefully with some chills dudes. Good luck to you man.
---
That's a huge red flag. You need to run. Zero exceptions. Or explanation
---
iirc MC bosses were immune to fire damage (stupid high fire resist), you can't raid MC as a fire mage unless you want to deal no damage
---
Retail has all the action in One zone, whichever is the newest. It also doesn’t feel like a world, nor the enemy players. I love world pvp, but there isn’t any to be found in retail wow honestly. You can go kill some ransoms, but there is no sense of war, of ganking etc
---
No need to respec, can heal as HotW spec, but he should go to that DG as a healer, not as a tank.
---
Leveling a warrior isn’t as bad as people make it out to be. You’ll have downtime but it’s not a big deal, also just make friends when you log in for whatever quest you’re working on. Classic WoW is very collaborative and there should be plenty of people to group up with as your make your way to 60.
---
Not classified anymore 😂
---
Spooky scary UD mounts.
---
Felsteed.
---
Paladin chargers.
---
The 100% speed Rams are also pretty cool.
---
So you basically want to get all the DG loot to you.
---
You better be the only tank on your server bro, because no one will like grouping with you and, with no crossrealm, you'll be knows pretty soon as someone that wants to sponge every gear from the run.
---
Scorn Furlbrow is aptly named.
---
I always lvoed the raptors.One of the main reasons my main back in Vanilla was a troll rogue
---
warlock 100% mount
---
This is a goddamn masterpiece lmao.
---
Besides you know... all those guilds with players who look at logs to perform better.
---
I predict their enthusiasm for pizza wanes after the 15th consecutive meal. Here are some things that I've appreciated lately: 
---
\- a strong headlamp that is rechargable. I didn't really wear one for 30 years and I've worn mine 3-10 times a week since buying it a year ago. So, so, so, so useful. So useful. So very nice to have laying around nearby to make everything visible.  
---
\- Chair - Staple Hyken - comfortable and breathable 
---
\- giant mousepad - $10 to $25 and about two feet by three feet on the desk. When everything is a mousepad life is better
---
\- three-jet butane lighter
---
\- a good 12V drill and a drill bit kit. [This](https://www.amazon.com/Bosch-GSR12V-140FCB22-Flexiclick-Driver-System/dp/B074GYX6XG) has saved me about 10 hours and much frustration so far, though if you are considering it you could do better than that price. 
---
\- electric toothbrush
---
\- [computer repair kit](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Repair-Kits/b?node=13825561) 
---
\- good German [alligator pliers](https://www.amazon.com/Knipex-8801250-10-Inch-Alligator-Pliers/dp/B000X4KPIU?th=1)
---
Vanilla is full of hassless like that, it’s part of the fun.
---
What about Truefaith’s Vestments from tailoring?
---
Nice
---
Amazing my dude.
---
Gotcha. Thanks
---
Dude you obviously play a paladin lmao
---
I really hope they do update this. I recently tested Herod’s Helmet on a Troll on a PServer and it looks really awful, like the helmet practically sits on the troll’s head instead of being worn. I’d consider rolling a troll Warrior if it was fixed.
---
Yeah, but the rest of the level 60 set is way better.
---
35 hère. Yep I think we are. Let’s let the old time speak together :p
---
Hmm I'm not sure how I feel about this. Thinking about it from a pvp perspective... I loved having everyone visible in the game. Guess I'll just have to wait and see.
---
Only 2 bosses are immune, the rest do have high fire resist as you say, but not to the point where you'll deal no damage. It will be lowered quite a bit, though.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure classic MC was almost all fire immune. I know this because I was playing fire all the way til 60 and then found out "Hey, your spec is worthless here". Thanks blizz!
---
Hahahaha man. This is exactly how it sounds every time Ion releases one of those q and as for retail
---
Well if it’s premade vs premade in bg his point is valid enough. Outside of that tho, yh I’m with you. Either way the initial slow, like frost nova, is gone for good.
---
Soar*
---
57 - Dwarf hunter will be back with the grandkids....
---
Rets have 2 stuns? Never played one in vanilla :P hammer of stun and?
---
Pretty sure Carapace Spine Crossbow won't drop until phase 2, so every hunter is going to want to get Blackcrow from LBRS. Slashclaw Bracers and Marksman's Girdle will also be decent +hit items from LBRS. I don't think anything else changes, unless the Hinterlands (Horde) and Sunken Temple trinkets are not in phase 1.
---
With modern tech they can double or triple the amount of servers literally overnight. Not going to be the problem they had last time where it takes months to roll new ones out because theybhave to acquire and set up hardware.
---
Every day I change my mind. I only know what I won’t be playing. That’s shaman Druid and Warlock. I wonder what I eventually will pick.
---
I think you're over-reacting. 
---
Most people playing classic won't give a rats ass about bis.
---
They just want to play the game and have fun with their buddies.
---
Grumpy Old Farts - hopefully has not been taken...
---
Some wood art from that guy https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bhq7hb/making_wow_stuff_out_of_wood_helps_me_pass_the/
---
That is correct, the videos are not based on Classic and the loot tables and drops rates will very likely be different.
---
Dwarf on a chicken mount is the greatest but getting gnomer rep sucks
---
I never think about the potential for that flask, so when it does drop it's a nice surprise.
---
Calling it now, you're gonna be a dwarf pally. Let me know in a few months
---
I'm 36, and I can't wait to play classic again :) 15 years ago I main tanked, RL'ed, and GM'em. My brother did the dkp. This time I'm taking it easy tho. Most probably on a ranged dps :)
---
I struggled daily aswel, I know I want to be Alliance, but either human rogue or human/nelf priest.
---
I’m think the human rogue because I then can farm items later easier, but spots for raids will be more difficult as dps classes will come in floods, tough choices ahead.
---
Nost is irrelevant. People need to stop acting like it was a carbon copy of Vanilla. It was the best guess that a bunch of amateurs could manage based on old videos and forum posts.
---
Yep. Give it a go and if it's not for you, end you subscription :)
---
You'll need to wait and see, we cannot predict how your servers economy shall be for this.
---
Agreed!
---
NO CHANGES
---
honestly, imo, rogue kinda shits on warrior too in 1v1s, if it's a really good rogue that knows how to use his cd's and properly kite in deadzone. There's been plenty of duel tournaments on vanilla servers lately with very skilled players, and rogue consistently destroys warriors. It's just that the average to good rogue will get shit on by warriors if he doesn't play the matchup completely correct, very good rogues that consitently do though, destroy warriors.
---
The fact that they didn't even acknowledge that is pretty disappointing.
---
I was hoping they'd compensate for it in some way, but I guess we're getting a watered down PvE experience :/
---
Getting to level 10 will be about two to three hours at the most...
---
There's really only one Hunter quest that you need to do anyway, and that's the tame beast chain.
---
It depends on what your goals are. If you are looking to explore the game and maybe play a little more causally going in blind is going to be soooo fun and a ton of people here probably envy you for being able to experience that.
---
If your goal is to be a top tier raider or pvper you are going to be at a significant disadvantage if you do no research.
---
Up to you.
---
I agree, I’ve basically set my mind to the notion that on the char screen, my gut will tell me what I want to really play. 
---
Troll priest or orc shaman is what I’m leaning to now!
---
Wolves were simple, but had great animations compared to Kodo and Raptor
---
If like to see more content released for Classic but not TBC. So some more dungeons and raids being introduced. All in new servers to what we will currently have without disturbing the sanctity of Classic itself.
---
I can't wait to read this thread again every day for the next two years.
---
Classic prices will be way less than private server prices so nobody can really tell you.
---
Yea I’m thinking roughly 15 hrs per week. Probably a good weekend push in there every once in a while
---
I managed to grind the rep to buy a Swift Frostsaber for my Gnome Mage. It was awesome.
---
Classic WoW is a recreation of the game as it was released back in 2004/2005 until the release of the first expansion pack (The Burning Crusade) in 2007. 
---
The modern version of WoW has had 7 expansions released, and countless patches, changing the game to be near unrecognisable from it's original form. One expansion (Cataclysm) even remade the entire world of the original game. 
---
So you could see WoW Classic as an entirely separate game. If you are ijnterested in it, go play it. If you are interested in playing modern WoW, go play that, they are only relatives of each other, not the same game.
---
-=xXx+A+xXx=-
---
You can just check this site ( [http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/) ) in a week or so as they're going to update it with the new BiS with the updated itemizations for Classic Launch.
---
Do you do commission work? I'd really like to buy the paladin one with my character name.
---
I’ll probably average 1.5-2 hours a night. I bet I average around 10-14 hours a week. Going to be weird feeling like a casual newb this time around....
---
Coooooooooool!
---
I played Classic in its entirety and I only found one or two pug groups which were really half professed guilds farming specific legendary items and inviting extra players. I doubt there will be MC pug raids. There may be some ZG pugs as the numbers are lowers. Even pug UBRS was a struggle sometimes to hold together.
---
Eh I use the chest and boots from 58 and the legs and hands from 60. Those boots prob don’t drop for awhile since it’s hit gear, I’d guess ZG patch. I also like the boots because of the ghost wolf bonus if I need to impromptu flag carry. I don’t wanna be switching boots constantly. I really hope they put in both sets of gear.
---
Strongest gear  
---
Strongest talents  
---
Weakest bosses
---
Why would anyone want this? I get that it makes life a thousand times easier for Blizzard, but PvE is gonna be a watered down joke.
---
Definitely agreed, but do make sure to find a nice friendly guild. Asking questions, helping each other out, the bonds that create are gonna last till you start raiding together and beyond. My old wow buddy may come to visit me irl for classic launch. He lives 3 countries over, yet I’ve met him many times the last 12 years or so. Can’t wait to do that over again
---
Great tracking! Mocha?
---
Yeah I didn’t take offense or downvote. Personally, I get it. I’m going to try and introduce my girlfriend to the game this summer, and I don’t want to start her off with epics, 4 bags, and a pile of gold. That would ruin the experience, even if it was helping her out. But I might buy her a level 5 wand to start. And if she makes it far, I’d consider buying her a sweet epic wep to show how it feels to be OP.
---
I’m 30 not nearly your age but I love that your family plays together.
---
is it hard to find a decent raiding guild as a holy paly?
---
i don't know what API calls would really be agenst the spirit of classic with how BfA currently is. maybe weakaura stuff gets limited? as anything else addon wise isn't relavant to classic.
---
you can argue some of the stuff DBM and bigwigs dose today but honestly that stuff was in classic aswell just some it was beta stuff.
---
r/HighQualityGifs is now monitoring this sub.
---
I'll probably aim for 2-3 hours once or twice a week and some time on the weekend.
---
Social life, exercise and getting more important things done will remain a priority....
---
And the other side of that is, we get to control how much we play every day, so we do get to control our burn out to a certain extent.
---
on my server prices are currently:
---
* Free action potion 1g.
---
* Superior Mana Potion 1,3g
---
* Superior Healing Potion 1,2g 
---
hope this helps

Yeah, flying mounts were the one thing that without a doubt was unnecessary about tbc. It certainly killed the world pvp we knew from vanilla. But in return pvp was competitive and waaay more balanced. If I had to chose between immense world pvp battles and a balanced pvp class system + arenas. I'd choose arenas all day.
---
Came here to write precisely that! Looked rather silly in tier 1, but bloodfang covered troll is awesome !
---
I'm 48 and was there for vanilla through about a month of cata. I also played a rogue on a pvp server, though switched to mage at some point. 
---
This time around I will be playing with my son (21) who remembers how I would NOT let him play in vanilla, though I gave in and he played a bit of BC with supervision (again, not happy about that!). 
---
Let me know what server you guys end up on.
---
Is 10 minutes and 21 seconds okay?
---
FRESH disagrees with you
---
Probably 2-3 hours Monday-Thursday then go hard Friday night and do some full day binges during the weekend. That’s my plan for the first couple of weeks.
---
I will enjoy seeing this content twice a week for the next two years.
---
everyone i knew farmed tyr's hand back in the day. because they were elites they dropped a lot of money and had far higher chance for cloth. they also dropped lockboxes at a decent rate and the place had a few spots where thorium spawned. the only downside was the constant pvp that was going on there for mobs.
---
the mobs themselves weren't that hard as most were casters iirc. some classes could solo them but even if you duo/trio them and fairly split the income it would still be very good g/h.
---
however nothing beats farming ore as far as g/h. i remember farming 1000g in a few days by simply running around winterspring/plaguelands mining.
---
TipsOut has a very informative video with Cadet. You might want to check that out, they talk pre raid bis among many other things.
---
you could keep your HS at dolanaar for a quick way back once you ding 10. And you'll have to make the run to wetlands/loch/dun morogh/IF etc at one point anyway, so might as well do it at lvl 1 (except you'll die a lot in wetlands, hehe). You'll lose some time for sure, but honestly i don't think more than maybe 15-20 minutes in the grand scheme of things.
---
Care to explain what's so bad about resilience? It was absolutly mandatory in order to make balance pvp apart from pve. If it wasn't for resilience, every change made in order to balance pvp or pve would have a significant impact on the other. Let's say dmg was too high compared to the lifepool, and we didn't have resilience, that would mean blizz would have to change literally all values in the entire pve content of the god damn game if they wanted to adress that.
---
No they’re obviously going to play a gnome mage.
---
Name some of those terrible, negative, lasting gameplay ramifications for us.
---
It has to do with the quality not the game itself
---
Honestly.. because we all know what we know.. everyone is going to be an Alchemist so I'll actually be staying away from it.
---
I bet you’re fun at parties.
---
I really like raptors, but Tauren can't use those, so...
---
Really? Wow that's insane! Absolutely insane.
---
I plan to partake in some instant 60 pserver shenanigans. I'm a TBC baby so I have no idea how each class feels in classic which is why I thought it would be a good test run for pvp/pve with these classes.

Currently debating between Shaman, Rogue, or Warr

I think this is a great list. However most of the time, I see "bis" lists missing out some alternatives. Good luck going for Savage Gladiator Chain. Or can Hunter's solo the ring? :O

Read again:  not all bosses were immune to fire damage.  You had to figure out which ones -- which were many.  For those that *were* -- you switched to frost bolts.  You could scorch the minions on Garr and then fireball them down single-handed.  Read up on which bosses were and which were not.  On Rag, it was frostbolts with a flask for max damage; on Onxyia it was the same thing.  Damage is also about rotation, knowledge and skill.

Gnome everything. If you can gnome it and you're not, you're fucking up.

Private servers are popping right now in anticipation

My full tier bloodfang rogue looked absolutely awesome.
---
They also look way cooler as combat rogues, while undead rogues who were obviously more popular looked  cooler as subtetly
---
What if i told you that I don't care what you think
---
I like the concept they have. However the lack of direct drop sources is troubling.
---
a retune would've made this comeback a hit but they just want to throw it out there with as little effort as humanly possible and never touch it again. whatever it makes in terms of cash is gonna be profit since the low maintenance costs on a team with no CS, no arts etc.
---
all the remastered(diablo, starcraft, warcraft) are made because activision will lose exclusivity over the titles if they don't actually use them, according to the new laws.
---
and the *bots* in this sub are so horny that they will take anything they can get.
---
so it's gonna be whatever :)
---
also fuck Kotick
---
I like the winterspring frostsaber best believe ima be farming it!
---
Without mp5 an average hunter can spam rank 1 clip for roughly 2 minutes before going oom. Rank 3 clip does 10 times more damage for just twice the mana cost. Granted its still only adding 33 dps instead of 3 dps before armor but still that'll end up being 3-5% of your dps in a fight. And ideally you would be using raptor strike on cooldown as well, so there goes some more mana.
---
respect for you.  I would love to play with family even just 1 hour a week even if we were different levels...just chill and catch up and build a mutual experience.
---
They’re going PVE cuz of this
---
If it was being widely abused, then why don't we see this happening. Atleast i've never heard of players in for example world first guilds getting silenced during world first races. I also think i've only heard from one high ranking PVPér who was saying he was silenced without reason. 
---
And this system is "live" now for several years, i'd say that if widespread abuse of this system to get a "edge" was actually happening we would have heard by now.
---
If you want those raids to be harder you should go in with 0 consumes and have about 3-5 people DC on the fight or have to look straight down so they can get above 5 fps.
---
What merges would they do its RP-PvP and RP servers Blizzard have been pretty resistant to merging or linking with other servers for the fact they are their own bubble. Now we are all aware many people don't sign petition's in addition I believe the previous poll linked to you should something like 1.6k people interested in joining RP-PvP servers, so a 50% rate of people signing a petition on a site which requires you to sign up etc isn't that bad.
---
As some have said in this thread, blizzard have even praised the old RP-PvP servers like Emerald Dream in the not to distant past. I obviously am aware of your distaste for RP-PvP after all we have all encountered each other on other forums etc.
---
Its classic and we all want our home. Which arguably isn't to much to ask even if it dies if we dig our own grave then we do but for others to act all high and mighty because they want to wax their Online Ego is a bit tiring. If it dies you can always say - They Think They Did, But They Don't.
---
Yeah well, I'm taking 2 week vacation in a cave somewhere with my brother, just wanted to be sure i can't play with him at the very start
---
Not surprised honestly. They won't get anything done on a PvP server.
---
My dad is around your age and plays. Cool that your his age and your dad plays!
---
Concur.
---
How would I get into one? Sorry for terrible question I haven't played in 10 years
---
I just tested, it takes 25min roughly to get to coldridge valley, and no need to cross wetlands, you can just follow the shoreline west of wetlands and drown somewhere north of ironforge and you can take the res sickness (or not) inside coldridge valley directly !
---
Yeah, I rolled on one to decide between mage and warlock.  I chose mage.  Now I am just practicing aoe farming.   I am also going to do some 1-12 runs to practice getting ahead of the pack.
---
If you have anything you want to practice I say go for it
---
&gt; The values used on Ragnaros are copied from guides that were written during vanilla.
---
Again, this is impossible. The codebase isn't available to view, so only the crudest elements of the bosses are visible (HP and ability cooldowns, basically). Damage and mitigation calculations are performed server-side and involve long equations that are not visible to us, as well as things like swing timers, crushing formulas and so on. 
---
The mangos devs responded to this challenge by adding very crude, very simple code in its place, meaning the bread and butter damage and resistance operations of every single boss in the game is both simplified and 'nerfed' from a difficulty perspective. 
---
None of the elements you mention compare at all to a scenario where a boss is dealing 3-5% less damage than it should and taking 3-5% more. That's what you're dealing with on private servers.
---
Coming from tbc you're probably used to shamans being highly demanded in raids on all 3 specs. Friendly reminder that only resto is viable in classic and both ele &amp; enh are sorta meme specs.
---
If you liked tbc war, you're like classic war. It's a fun class. Tho you gotta live with the fact that if you choose dps, you'll still have to off tank a bunch and always bring tank sets to raids.
---
Rogue is pretty much the same in pve, and more cooldown reliant &amp; less mobile in pvp.
---
What I meant is bumping 120dps to 140 doesn't change anything in a raid scenario. And you have access to mp5 anyway (blessings or totems and consumables).
---
PMed you

Bengal Tiger was never in vanilla. Do you mean the Zulian Tiger?

So, as you all know, I play a Shaman. I'm currently the best geared Shaman in the world and I have multiple world DPS records on WowMeterOnline. So I go into this Battleground because I feel like gracing my battlegroup with my presence, right? Everyone is cheering as I enter. They don't bother putting down a mage table or healthstone because they know that they're not going to need it--I, the Darkness, has come.
---
So I cast Lightning Shield on myself, because that's what Shamans do. They call down MOTES OF ELECTRICITY FROM THE HEAVENS and they SURROUND THEMSELVES with DEADLY AMOUNTS OF LIGHTNING! All of my teammates are instantly electrocuted to death, but me? I merely bathe in the energy; it is my plaything. Even though my teammates are now charred corpses, they continue to cheer, because they know that I can solo this. The gates open. I run in. With Ghost Wolf, my movement speed is increased by

They can hear the howl of my ghost wolf. They are all cowering--no, literally, they type the /cower emote and just stand there--as I cap the Stables. I cast WATERWALKING on myself--WATERWALKING, like Jesus, and I careen towards the Blacksmith. The Horde there see me coming and they just /afk the !@#$ out. I put down my totems before I start capping Blacksmith's flag. A Rogue tries to sap me--
---
BAM!
---
The Rogue is engulfed in flame as my Searing Totem SEARS him from the inside out! His leather clothing EXPLODES in a rain of fire that spirals around my beautiful female Draenei form as I continue to cap the Blacksmith. The fire rips through the Rogue's bones, but it doesn't even consider touching me--why? Because I've got

POTATOES. BOIL 'EM, MASH 'EM, STICK 'EM IN A STEW. AND HEARTS. SHAMAN DESIRES PALADIN HEARRRRRRRTS.
---
Just then, I see something through my Sentry Totem. It's the WoW General Forums! --People are complaining about how overpowered I am! They're saying that Shamans need to be nerfed. I smirk.

That's when I decide to take out my HAND OF RAGNAROS.

EIGHTY POINT FOUR DAMAGE PER SECONNNNND
---
I slam the Hand of Ragnaros down into the ground. Arathi Basin shatters like glass--the ground falls out from under me. The fabric of SPACE itself CRUMBLES beneath my feet.

I am a Draenei walking around New York--the cops try to stop me, but they forget all about me when they take a gander at my

42 here.  Can't wait.  Lots changed for me since I first played in 2005, but I'm going to try like hell to work classic into my schedule.
---
I have it all planned out. 
---
I’m going warlock main. I will have a warrior alt to level with my girlfriend and then have a mage bank alt who I will level to 35 so that I can get max tailoring
---
This is fucking gorgeous
---
Me too!  I'll be the first person on my server, BELIEVE IT!
---
Holy Paladins are top tier healers. If that’s what you want to play you’ll be sought after for raids and 5 mans
---
True.  Especially since, let's face, the Horde have some pretty compelling points to make about their own right to exist.
---
they arent tax evading, they are abiding by tax law.  Would you pay taxes you didnt have to pay?
---
So you're saying we'll be playing classic?????
---
Yup and yup. Can't prevent it and it's not something that I came across in my old battlegroup often.
---
You could make 3 coupons for a good clean of the whole apartment/laundry etc. this way you don’t hurt your budget and honestly it’s wifey material.
---
In the short term?
---
I'd like to see servers for Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath, as a sort of Classic-Block. 
---
As all three were still roughly following Classic design philosophies, even if each still have their own distinct flavors.
---
If they keep going, into Cata and beyond, I honestly wouldn't mind.
---
While i don't like other eras as much Vanilla or TBC, I do like SOME aspects of most expansions and wouldn't mind having the ability to play them in their original forms again, even if it's just to take a bit of a vacation from my normal favorites.
---
And I'm sure every era has people who consider it their favorite or never got to experience it with it's proper mechanics.
---
But at the very least, if the Classic project does well, I'd like to see the first three at very least.
---
The Rough Beginning, the Polished Middle, the Slow Decline of the Classic Era of design.
---
I'm not talking about pre-bis. I'm talking about the best in slot gear from outside raids until late BWL/AQ. Warlock for example you're looking at "Of Shadow Wrath" suffixed green/blue gear that is better than most of the stuff from MC. But the rolls on the amount of spell power are usually pretty random and it's an extremely low percent chance to get the highest spell power rolls.
---
Yeah I was attracted by the cheese windfury build in vanilla for PvP and the fact that I would have a highly demanded spot in PvE, but healing in 40 man is something I'd have to get used to. 
---
Warr was also my choice for its viability in both environments, but I guess the downside is having to farm for both Dps BiS and OT BiS
---
Rogue was always that class I saw people at high skill cap play well, and then I pick it up and spill my spaghetti. They look fun in PvP, and I'm sure if I put in the time I can learn it (like any class), but my main worry is the potential overpopulation of undead rogues...even in 40 man raids 
---
I wish druids were more fleshed out during classic because a tauren druid was my first toon in TBC. From what I've seen it seems like they have an awkward identity in PVP and PVE.
---
Every bit helps, and at a bare minimum its nice to not be behind the tanks on damage if you can help it. I'm not saying you can't keep wing clip spam up forever, I'm just saying its not as trivial and its not as cut and dry as "hunters are bis nightfall swingers". Not to mention there are fights like rag where you may not want to or be able to have a hunter in melee range to nightfall in the first place.
---
Yeah Zulian Tiger
---
I know people say like Ashbringer or Menethil are best but has anybody seen them actually? I mean, how are you going to convince 39 ppl that you are a better choice than a war or a hunter.
---
I make my first alt.
---
That's what happens.
---
Discord already is the same on pservers. It'll only be amplified on official realms with a much higher player base.
---
This thread is gonna be deleted but yeah I just started a shaman up on Fourthmail since I haven't played one before but I plan to main one in Classic. Name is Rahnza.
---
I work 5pm til midnight so from 9am til 4:30pm I have absolutely nothing to do so looks like I'm in the over 5 hour gang.
---
Thank you for the link. Was a good read.
---
It says where its dropped from and there is a big blue text saying "View on Wowhead" anything else you need?
---
And they're a shit class that didn't get any better until Burning Crusade.
---
right, if you are going to be using frostbolt for the majority of bosses that resist fire then why spec fire unless for RP purposes
---
That's not the problem, the problem is if you open too many servers on launch but most of the players quit after a few days/weeks because they were just curious and not really interested. 
---
This will leave so many servers underpopulated
---
No, you can skip ranks.
---
It'll even refund spent points when buying a higher rank of the same skill so you don't have to clear everything first.
---
Thanks!

As a lore nerd, the best WoW related gifts I received are 
---
* [World of Warcraft: Lands of Mystery (2006)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Lands_of_Mystery). It's ment to be a source book for the tabletop RPG version of WoW but nevermind that, it's filled with very interesting lore about the continents and the civilizations.
---
* [World of Warcraft: Chronicle (2016-2018)](https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft:_Chronicle). Those are the most recent lore books. There are 3 volumes with gorgeous artworks and hundreds of stories about the lore of Warcraft. The first volume focuses more on the creation of the world, the titans and the old gods. The second talks about Draenor and the invasion of Kalimdor, the birth of the horde and the alliance and the first and second wars. The third volume is about the third war, the Lich King and later expansions such as TBC, LK and Cata.
---
If he's a man-child he could also like one of the old [DC action figures](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_action_figures) if you manage to find one of a character he likes or the class he plays (if you know). Those are not too expensive, I think you can still find some on amazon or ebay for &lt;$50. Doesn't really matter if they are replicas and not originals, it's just a mold not fine handmade craftsmanship. The recent official figures and statues on the Blizzard store are ridiculously expensive.
---
Same here haha.
---
Scoping out guilds that start raids at 6-7PM EST is pretty difficult. And they tend to ignore our mandatory prune juice breaks as well.
---
Druids are the best flag carries in wsg and as such pretty useful. Feral is also really not too bad in pvp in general. In pve however you're likely being asked to play resto :/
---
So what ? There will still be many guilds that wouldn't be able to clear the content without the 1.12 buffs. This is like turning HC into NM and saying it doesn't matter for Mythic raiders. But it does matter for normal and heroic raiders
---
This! Maybe expand the time since TBC was only live for 1.5 year
---
This system just feels overly complicated.
---
Some version of list dkp, that was used in our guild was like every item is up for dkp bidding, except Tier items. It had a fixed low dkp cost and every class member would get 1 item, then the next on the list.

I want multiple alchemist at 35 eventually but not to make potions. I’m going to want to be able to make arcanite bars. I’ll probably go mining engineer so when DM:E launches I can farm jump runs for money and resources to fund the alchemist. This will be useful for being able to make that thinderfury 5 years later when I get both bindings.

Welcome to WoW: ~~Classic~~ Casual
---
&gt; Now we are all aware many people don't sign petition's
---
Didn't seem like it to me when 280,000 signed the petition for Blizzard to give us Classic WoW. Every RP-PvP guild leader worth his salt knows about it and still they barely managed to get 800 people to sign it. 
---
It's like I said, people make a lot of noise but when push comes to shove most of them either don't care or don't bother because they're not playing on RP-PvP realms. You can't expect to demand and receive a server when you can't even get 1k players to say they would want one to play on. 
---
&gt; I believe the previous poll linked to you should something like 1.6k people interested in joining RP-PvP servers,
---
And you are well aware of the populations from former RP-PvP servers I linked from retail/wowservers. I've no idea when they made that poll and who voted in it (I know I didn't) but there's a poll like that done every week on /r/classicwow. Even when Blizzard comes out and says "look, there's not enough people to mandate this type of server" the RP-PvP community will still act like a bunch of children and say that they know better, that they do have the numbers, etc. 
---
Just prove it because I really don't anyone is seeing it. That "RP-PvP loving community" Discord server from the last "sign our petition" thread had 60 people in it last I checked. Their petition had 800 folks (mix of RP-PvP players and just nice people) and just 9 our of 236 guilds on the list of known/confirmed announced guilds for Classic WoW. Their arguments are some poll done who knows when, who knows where - with almost 2k players which are nowhere to be found, neither in that petition nor in RP-PvP guilds. If I were to guess, it seems to me like the idea of an RP-PvP realm looks enticing because they see it as RP + PvP, but then they get a reality check when the best raiding guilds are going either PvP or PvE and they want to roll with them. 
---
It doesn't make for a very convincing argument - not for me, for but Blizzard.

---
Jea ignore the complete rest of my post where i describe why raid back then where hard for the top % and still will be hard for normal guilds in classic.
---
I dont ASSUME things its a FACT that vanilla and bc raids where buggy as shit and this was the reason more often then not for progress to stop.
---
And i also dont need to assume 1 wipe in vanilla is way more time consuming on the player )Gold , consumes etc) and the raid(Ress, buffs, etc) then on retail. Its a fact.
---
And where in my Post do i write that raids will be nerfed ? Maybe you should read it. 
---
Just one example Aq40 was unbeatable in vanilla for like 90days + proven mathematical back in the day by ion himself, that will be fixed since we use 1.12 Data.  Only to give an example of one very well documented case.
---
Blizzard said, so fact again, we will use the 1.12 version so alot of nerfs and bug fixes will be in, that made over the lifecyle of classic.
---
And if you want to estimate yourself how mutch got fixed over the years just klick around abit (Ofc you should take the patchnotes with a grain of salt dont thing they are 100% correct):

I think there is no need to explain why bwl and mc will easyier to clear.

Jea but the skill checks where not mind breaking or anything.
---
Its on a level of normal Raids in WoW Today, but in vanilla every wipe is way more taxing on the metal of the players and take way more time.
---
So a few wipes because someone of 40 ppl happen to make 1 mistake happen, and the worse you guild is the more often it will happen.
---
Yes!
---
The vanilla game is still very good, nostalgia asside.  Personally, I have very little nostalgia for WoW because my first MMO experience was Everquest, which I played for 2 years.  Virtually all of the "great memories" that you see people mention when they talk about classic WoW, I had with Everquest, not World of Warcraft.
---
But while I believe EQ was a superior social experience to WoW and the online world felt more real (for too many reasons to get into in one post), WoW was a much better-designed game in most other respects.  The introductory areas are engaging and draw you into the world.   Quests are basically just incentives to visit a variety of places instead of just grinding the most efficient generic mobs, but give good experience rewards and items.  The classes are well-designed at least from a PvE standpoint, with each class having a wide array of different abilities despite each class having its own distinct character.   All the instanced dungeons I played were fun, with interesting level layout along with satisfying boss encounters at the end.
---
I enjoyed the PvP experiences I had, but bear in mind that I quit after about 3-4 months (Level 45 or so), and only played right at release.  I never did battlegrounds and most PvP I had involved either isolated encounters or fighting off Alliance raids of The Crossroads in The Barrens.
---
I quit after a few months because I really wasn't willing to devote my life to another addictive MMORPG at that point.
---
The damage values are known. As for crushing hits I don't know, but his abilities have well known damage windows as have most bosses.
---
The Mangos devs are long gone, they haven't been working on it since Nost at least which is why the devs on servers like Vanillagaming were pure guesswork and often overestimated the damage and armour of bosses. 
---
Also, why do you assume that using the incorrect values makes it easier? It could be the other way around, as it was on VG where Ragnaros had something like 6k armour and 200 resistance.
---
Honestly wouldn't correspond with this account. He spams low effort videos in this sub.
---
I don't want anything to be added,  but if something absolutely must be added, I would want the level cap to always stay 60.
---
Add new dungeons? Fine. New bg's? Might be fun.  New raids?, fine, but always keep the top level 60 so end game gear will always be relevant.
---
If new gear comes up,  make it the Same power level as current end game gear. No power creep. 
---
That could be an opportunity to add gear for hybrid specs, to make them a little bit more viable without ever having to tweak talents.
---
I mean if you don't stay on top of dispels you get booted out of premade in the time it takes to lose a WSG.
---
I would recommend platinum WoW.
---
I was the guild master of Trade Chat in Smolderthorn. I lead a 230+ man raid on EK. It wasn't particularly a douche thing to do, but it was fun for a few hours knowing Ally couldn't use some of their major cities until I ALLOWED it.
---
Good times...
---
I actually favor the change.  Sometimes I just want to relax and do xyz.  Other times I want to fight.  Now I can pick and choose.
---
Ah that's the toxic WoW community I know and love
---
"So I decided to go to Empty Far Away Town, which is what they called Darnassus in those days. So I bitchedon the official forums, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost nothing, and in those days, nothing had pictures of the troll capital city on 'em. 'Why roll troll priest' you'd say...
---
So where were we? Oh, the important thing was that I was complaining on the forums, which was the style at the time..."
---
Grab your pitchforks, guys. OP can't use his weeb blood elf skin. THIS MEANS WAR.
---
RIP warlocks
---
Honestly it's probably more related to pve and server transfers. Big hardcore guilds transfer to server with high pop. Skews faction balance, more people join sever based on that because they want larger pool of people of their faction to play with. Small minority of opposing faction might transfer due to world pvp imbalance.
---
Classic WoW was legitimately more addictive than cocaine maybe not crack
---
Breaking ToS. Sorry not sorry
---
A world where Tirion doesn't get killed in a 5 minutes long quest so EVERYONE can get Ashbringer for 2 years, then throw it to the trashbin, like it never existed.
---
People that ask for this, is it one race in particular they are interested in? Or do they actually believe that all new models look better?
---
Amazing. Enjoy these memes while they last lads, once classic is out nobody is going to have te to make memes of this caliber.
---
This is some /r/HighQualityGifs shit. S+
---
There are a lot of funny moments from bugs, but regardless I really doubt they will re-create bugs.
---
I did. Leveled a Rogue to 60, did all the raids, got to C’Thun before I quit because I don’t want to burn out before Classic.
---
I actually disagree on one note here. Gathering professions are more useful in mains, as they are suited for being more out in the world farming, gathering etc. They have better gear and better chance of having the upper hand when ganks are possible. 
---
Especially important to have Epic Mount to efficiently farm herbs/mine nodes. You will never ever get a Black Lotus or a Rich Thorium Ore without an Epic mount.
---
Having atleast one gathering profession on your main is what's most efficient IMHO.
---
Enchanting on alts etc.
---
You could level tailoring for spesific purposes like Truefaith Vestments, but drop it for Herb/Alch or something similar later.
---
Video is older and doesn’t not contain information on the new itemization
---
While this is not specific to WoW Classic, I think you should actually look up effective keybinding strategies if you're unfamiliar with keybinding. Aside from that, don't look up specifics on game strategy or anything. Lore research is fine since it could really only enhance the experience by giving you more context to the world.
---
Vanilla used TS3 most of the time. I remember doing my first MC raid with that!
---
Thanks!  Do you train each new rank of Claw and Bite as you level or what do you prioritize? Additionally, do you train Dash and Prowl?
---
If CSC isn't available then Blackcrow will get the job done!
---
As someone else so elequently explained in this sub, resilience is a stat that I dont feel, and makes my opponents see 40% smaller crits. It's not fun for anyone.
---
Classic pvp was great. The inclusion of resilience didnt magically make pve and pvp completely independent. They still certainly had to consider pve when buffing the damage of a move for pvp?
---
Additionally, I would argue that arenas put a microscope on balance that simply wasn't necessary before them. As a result, things like resilience had to be introduced to "save the day" from problems that weren't present before.
---
Horde - Black Kodo
---
Alli - Rams/Tigers
---
Ram, Raptor and UD Horse.
---
And since I play Tauren I will waddle around on my Kodo. :/
---
The only hope I have is Baron Rivendare or ZG Mounts. lol
---
Rhok’delar is good but the attack speed is slightly faster than blue crossbows which causes you to clip shots in your rotation. If you are really min/max, blue xbow is better but usually you can use Rhok and still perform well
---
I'm a cat person through and through when it comes to mounts. Expect to see my human warrior in Teldrassil if I roll one!
---
Respec is expensive, I ran this on my warrior, you can tank, dps and pvp.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#LVhxkAboxzVZVV0co
---
Tanked every 5 and 10 man raid running this. Gl man
---
Minor speed enchant m8
---
It's all dependent on server pop, which no-one knows.
---
They almost definitely won’t bother saying anything about it. It was allowed in vanilla and has been allowed ever since. No reason to expect them to change their stance on it just for classic.
---
A true man of culture.
---
Only thing that makes me think they will is how ingrained those bugs are in the vanilla experience. Moonwalking especially.
---
I think so. It's not that we couldn't clear more wings, because of the difficulty, it was the TBC announcement that killed our Raid. That Naxx was so hardcore is a myth. Twin Emperors where way harder, than Anub.
---
C'Thun and Kel'Thuzad are still not someone you laugh at.
---
But you can do it, if you set your mind on it and have 39 people with the same goal.
---
Would small tusks prevent this issue and display the "correct" model? This could change EVERYTHING I've planned so far!
---
That's just the alliance camp at the edge of Thousand Needles and Feralas.
---
I probably changed my mind a thousand times. Which is why i just ended up giving in and trying out the instant 60 pserver.
---
Now I know for sure I will be a Gnome Warlock main. #Gnomercy
---
Horde or Alli? 37 checking in!
---
to be honest I don't see how this sub puts viability on a pedestal. Rather I see a more casual/relaxed (as opposed to hardcore/strict) attitude to be the mainstream. could you provide me with some pointers pls as to where in this sub the hardcore mindset is prevalent?
---
besides this, I 80% agree with your statement. being a dedicated player is much more valuable to the guild than being the "best spec/class"
---
however, I think it needs to be said that min/maxing does have a big effect on the raid. for example, if you look at what worldbuffs and consumables give you if you stack 100% versus 0%, the gap is huge. and just because private servers have rids clearing AQ40 and even Naxx on release day shouldnt give a false sense of raids being easy. you can still fail at bosses and wipe, and get stuck in progression. and chosing suboptimal specs isn't really helping this.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is: yes, player is more important than class, and maybe we should look at "viable player" rather than "viable class", but especially if you go more towards the casual raidstyles, going for suboptimal specs is only gonna pile up on the problems to progression that you might already have. however, if youu do have dedicated players who prepare (learn class, boss mechanics, consumes, worldbuffs), then class really doesnt matter that much anymore.
---
Apparently it’s all of them.
---
During early beta those were called bind stones. If I remember right those are where your ghost would go before all the graveyards were added. They also served as your recall location before innkeepers were added.
---
Did you seriously think swapping models was okay??? What did you think would happen?
---
"That's the World of Warcraft that You Play" did it for me back in the day.
---
I want to lead a WSG premade team. I want to be well-known on my server for my teams dedication and ability to pull off amazing plays. I was previously known on my vanilla server Smolderthorn for leading a guild with over 1000 members (600 active players, the rest were alts) but this time around I'd like to be known specifically for my team's PvP skill. I want each player on my team to be equal to at least 5 casual PvP players.
---
The only change I want to see is WoW Classic going from "Not Live" to "Live"
---
The dead kind. ⚔
---
Isboxer is just one of many ways to broadcast your keys/mouse. As a 40 boxer Idk why you keep saying 6x as efficient 😋
---
If they drop nothing except one item and the addon only detects it when they do, wouldn’t the drop rate show as 100%...?
---
We should make a old man guild
---
Guilds should usually recognize certain items as PvP items. I'd argue the people you'd compete with for might of menethil and ashkandi would be warriors for their arms PvP spec, or other paladins for their ret spec. 
---
However if you are actively raiding as ret in naxx it would surely be a guild that'd, you know, have you around for being cute and stuff and might reward you with the weapon if you'd actively use it in Pve. 
---
That's how it was for the enhancement shaman in my guild... Coincidentally called Menethil.
---
and yet they do. or perhaps its only the trees I move behind.
---
No, noone uses AV cbow when u have this bow in pservers and pservers are pretty much max min/max.
---
In addition to prot or ret being a better experience, as a paladin you really benefit from having a person to level with of basically any class. The best recommendation is to make friends.
---
You can keep a secondary set of intelligence and eventually healing gear and just heal dungeons even when not holy.
---
Red is Dead
---
Blood elf were not in classic :)
---
Because it is efficient in comparison to someone playing without the use of 3rd party programs that automate gameplay.
---
In retail I leveled up every class, except Demon Hunter that came out after I quit, to 80+ on Horde. Many of those were done during WotLK, so I experienced plenty of both the old world and the new one. I'm still going horde. Everytime I try to roll alliance I feel like the quest text is aimed at 10 year olds.
---
Lol not bad news for classic. Pretty much just bad news for you.
---
Mmmmm not so sure about that my dude
---
Someone didn't watch the video
---
That's because it's not true. You don't only use 1 button, but you use 1 button most of the time. Somehow people have confused most of the time with all the time. As warlock I use more than 50 buttons, but most of the time I use 1 button.
---
Honestly no idea if ill even end up playing.
---
Im totally obsessed by it and would LOVE TO, but I have like 4 hours a day of free time if I neglected everything completely including girlfriend, cooking etc, and from my teens I feel like this game is just not fun or possible unless nolifing, let alone all the guilt I'd feel spending all my time on it. 
---
Idk
---
I gotchu I gotchu
---
Its toxic to point out that you're being intellectually dishonest?
---
Sorry you feel that way. 
---
You know full well that he's comparing a dps to a dps, and not a dps to a healer. 
---
And if you don't, then as stated, you're not smart enough to understand nuance. And if that's the case, then it'd make as much sense arguing with you, as it is to argue with a rock.
---
***Improved seal of the crusader is not so much efficient compared to other talents in these levels in my opinion.***
---
That doesn't mean it's morally right.
---
World of warcraft is based on the universe where the big and by far most fleshed out story was all the major factions getting past their differences and teaming up to save their world.
---
I can't even decide on Horde or Ally. I was Ally before, so I want to go Horde for a new experience. I kinda wanna go Ally because I know it well though.
---
I don't know then. Don't get hang up on it though. Just tell yourself it isn't the case.
---
Working on it! The +8 str vs +1% haste part is very very tricky, but I promise it'll be done sooner rather than later!
---
I doubt Blizzard will give praise to a group that they actively squashed.
---
Noggenfogger and Deviate fish are here for you mate.
---
Can you pm me too 😁
---
All the people talking about how hard it will be to level and get gold and such are talking shit then lmao.
---
I was on Paladin Stage 1, and Wowhead doesn't explain where this item is from:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13969/loomguard-armbraces](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13969/loomguard-armbraces) 
---
On shroud of nathrezim, it does detail which boss drops that item. However, it's still inconsistent across each item.
---
In the same boat. If friends go a specific way I'll do that. Other wise...launch screen feelings
---
If I remember correctly (it’s been a long, long time) small tusks functioned properly and did not cause clipping issues.
---
I've really been looking at Locks/Druids or Priests, but it seems a lot of people are going Lock/priest so I think I will end up as Druid. I always enjoyed playing unpopular classes, and druid healing is the only healing I haven't done in WoW, here's hoping  I don't hate myself after 3 months lol
---
My NE on Winterspring Frostsaber will look crisp!
---
What he means is it changes the game to make alienated specs viable, he would like to further punish them by making fights longer
---
As a 26 year old, who feels ancient when talking to anyone ingame, I feel personally attacked.
---
Though that could also be made apparent that the Classic WoW Reddit Community is heavily made up by a specific subset of players, mainly coming from Private Servers or Players that quit WoW rather than those from the current retail circles.
---
With all due respect from the discussions i've had with the Retail RP server players. Their communities are current rather closed and while some are happy with classic others are quite hostile. Having No RP-PvP would drive hostilities further almost certainly.
---
Now I agree that on retail that RP-PvP is weaker as lets be honest only one server has never been merged and that is US - Emerald Dream which is the 3rd largest RP type server. Below Memeguard and Wyrmrest.
---
However, what also must be considered is that said servers started later into vanilla's life cycle and thusly had a disadvantage against other servers. Given the length of time since the original and now, it also gives people a time to change view points on what they are looking for in the game.
---
Now on the EU side all the servers were merged but that made it the 2nd largest RP server as the RP-PvP group for english speakers and the german block is the 3rd largest block for RP in the EU and the French RP-PvP block represents the 5th largest RP block.
---
Now obviously the biggest issue clearly on the EU side is multiple languages, I would argue if blizzard was massively concerned then just say well RPer's that want RP-PvP no matter what language must share a server. I imagine their current worry would be having at least 3 of them for each core language which i imagine is what they intend for flat RP currently.
---
Here's my take on it: If they wanted to make a game that wasn't like World of Warcraft, they could've gone ahead and done it.
---
But they did try, didn't they? They made Titan. And it was a disaster of conflicting visions and stupid design decisions that ultimately led to its demise. Dozens of veterans and hundreds of employees left Blizzard voluntarily in frustration. The people who remained then decided to apply all their talents to World of Warcraft.
---
"Expanding" World of Warcraft by undermining its core features seems to me to be a very strange thing to do. We can argue over subscription numbers all we like, but fact of that matter is WoW was growing until WotLK, stagnated completely during the latter half when LFD was introduced, and then started dying off. Nowadays there's huge spikes in server activity whenever they release content, because people want the story and universe of Warcraft, but they don't actually want World of Warcraft.
---
So yes, it's the largest subscription based MMORPG _as far as we know_. Question is how long that'll last.
---
Yes, I'm quite bitter over what they did to WoW. :p
---
Sorry I'm blind. I thought seal of the crusader improved seal of command. I also thought you put points into vindication.
---
Sup blood. I've been looking for something very similar. Hit me up on discord and we can chat! Space Cadet Bear #3461

You shame the name of moose.
---
Moral has no place here. It does however mean that your taxsystem is pretty bad.
---
Brother I have done nothing but try keep it on topic while you went on a tirade about personal attacks, passive aggressiveness, and projection. I hope you find your peace.
---
So they should remove or delay the Lionheart Helm plans from dropping then? Because that doesn't get replaced ever.
---
Maybe they should move the Aged Core Leather Gloves to AQ/Naxx instead, after all Dagger Rogues will never replace them.
---
Onslaught Girdle? Way too strong for MC, better stick it on C'thun's loot table instead. After all, it's not fun if you're not getting better gear in some slots for over a year.
---
And all of these items are MASSIVELY more common than Bonereaver's Edge btw.
---
I cringe so hard at these massive (trillion) dollar companies not just buying out a game publisher. They try to make these awful games.
---
Apple Arcade? 😂 
---
Amazon Games? 😂 
---
Google Stadium or whatever it is 😂
---
Uh alright, anyways...
---
Multiboxing probably won’t be a problem in pvp because /follow won’t work and there is no diminishing returns on aoe. It’s not very useful in farming gold for 99% of people since mobs/nodes can only be gathered by 1 person in vanilla. Dungeons are hard and most multiboxers suck balls at the game and won’t be able to do them. 
---
Even mass multiboxers that try to grief in pvp can be instantly wiped by a group of 5 with sappers. 
---
People hate multiboxers and they will likely spend significantly more time getting camped than anyone else lols
---
When I Moonfire a male Orc to death and he just plops down, face in the dirt, arms and legs spread out like a green starfish.  Gives me the giggs every time.

We really need to rename Ret Pala to CHAD. The CHAD leveling guide! .. I'd watch that again..

---
Literally this. I am beyond excited to book out and grind yetis and shit while staying up all night pretending I am 15 again.
---
They could just let a boosted version have a chance to drop after a certain phase, so you can possibly get an item that has extra stats in the later parts of classic. Call it something like warforging or titanforging or something.    
---
/s please don't kill me in my sleep
---
A couple points:
---
First that wasn't me you were responding to. You're probably more of a "rock" than I am.
---
Second the "wait...what" is pretty indicative of a joke. Taking a joke as a literal position and calling someone stupid is pretty standard iamverysmart material. It's also condescending and toxic.
---
Idk what your point is. It will take multiboxers way longer to level and making gold will not be anywhere near 5x as efficient or whatever. They have that much more in then way of expenses.
---
Why would you want to play a Blizzard game then?
---
Gnome mage is BiS so makes sense
---
I know, no worries you don't have to apologise.
---
Changing life really would make no different. People don't quite get that. The mechanics are fundamentally easy.
---
Unless you want every boss to be a gear check ("Can the collective raid do a least X dps? If no, wipe.") There is no fixing content.
---
Just hope for new content post-naxx that can better cater to the modern gamer.
---
"I was definitely planning on breaking the ToS before I found out that they are enforcing it"
---
I don't think you'll find much sympathy with that kind statement.
---
The stun resist is why people roll Orc.  But yeah, only your melee warlock build will benefit.
---
It's helpful, but not required to be successful.
---
Sincerely, 
---
 A gimpy handed gamer
---
You're also looking at the reddit community. This will be no where near the actual average play time.
---
Also, a lot of people in this pole are saying they will commit 5+ hours a day, but when push comes to shove I doubt it. Maybe for the first 2 weeks or so
---
Yeah I'm going PvP so I really hope my buds go alliance instead of horde. The LAN parties will be pretty awkward if it's my guild camping everyone at the LAN party.

---
Since you're probably like me and watched the video 4 times on low quality without seeing anything happen, at roughly 12 seconds when the trumpet blasts the gnome equips a shoulder item. shoulders are rare in classic while leveling so it's a good feeling.
---
Did you get banned for changing models? Did you actually think that wouldn't happen?
---
The gear in the video is not that op. The t3 shoulders are for looks, true-strike shoulders might be a better choice there for pure fast grind. IronFoe and offhand from ZG as weapons, AB blue boots, ZG Gloves and some other pieces of gear to match a black outfit. Basically the gear is slightly better than a pre-bis setup.  
---
After all you're killing mobs 4 - 5 levels lower than yours. The numbers should be similar if you hve the spot for yourself.
---
Hi, /u/akbrag91
---
Literally top kek.
---
And if you are alliance that quest with the item that turns you into a Furbolg.
---
Du du dudu du duuu....hey guys, madseason here...
---
Yeah I agree his videos are very therapeutic actually if I think about it.
---
Heal meters are only half the job of a healer, and encourages them to ignore the other half of their job in order to increase their epeen. Wiping on Baron Geddon because half the dispellers are padding their heal meters is no fun.
---
I don't think its little reward. 
---
If its done perfectly, you'll be able to get a Raptor + Melee Swing in for each Aimed Shot you fire over the course of a fight.
---
That obviously depends on fight and execution. I'm curious to see how reliable it is even in perfect conditions.
---
It's enough to make Hunters more competitive at the very least.
---
&gt; The damage values are known.
---
They are not. There is observable guesswork based on combat logs and there is public information released through guides etc. Neither are correct. Damage values in WoW (and most MMOs) are based on extremely long formulas that incorporate many other stats and unusual mathematical formulas coefficients, often created for server optimisation reasons - for instance, it might seem crazy that a boss would resist melee damage based on fire resistance, but by introducing a minuscule amount into the damage equation, then the encounter can draw down fire resistance stats faster when the big fire damage move happens.
---
&gt;Also, why do you assume that using the incorrect values makes it easier? It could be the other way around, as it was on VG where Ragnaros had something like 6k armour and 200 resistance.
---
It's a fair point, but there are two reasons to assume the opposite: 
---
First, because making an encounter more difficult could break it, and patching can be difficult for private servers where there's no Q/A.
---
Second, the example you gave (6K armour and 200 resistance) is the perfect example of how crude private server code is - in Blizzard's codebase, there would be an additional dozen lines of code on any boss's defense and mitigation programming, all *adding* to the boss's resistance by necessity. None of these are available to the devs. With these stats being set to 'blizzlike' values, it inherently means the bosses are considerably nerfed. 
---
Finally, you mention the mangos devs are 'long gone' - they're not. Nost was controversial because the original devs demanded that Nost release their own code as part of the original open source license, which Nost wouldn't do (it's all tenuous given the piracy we're talking about). But more to their point, their original work still makes up almost all of the private server code. And we know that because Nost never went through the extensive testing that would be required if the basic code was being extensively amended. Every single private server out there is a custom Mangos job, meaning they are limited in what they can change. Most customisation has been in the realm of pathing, anti-cheat and admin-level tools.
---
There are already many guilds recruiting. Check the latest Looking for Group Monday post. Very likely you’ll find a guild that appeals to you.

wow you sound like the best wow player ever xd
---
It seems humanly impossible for you to reply without filling your post with ridiculously over the top hyperbole. It honestly makes your opinions hard to take seriously when you make sweeping, over the top generalisations that come purely from emotion and nothing else.
---
I asked you to not bother replying without examples, and you have provided none.

Works great with Mage, that's what my missus and I have done. Righteous Fury yourself, Seal of Righteousness, BoM on you and BoS on them, and judge Justice if you've got tightly packed humanoids who like to run away. Works a treat

I laughed way too hard at this. 10/10 I'm already watching again!

Engineering is the absolute best profession for all classes for PVE though.
---
I soloed it on a private server.. So I am wondering if its soloable on classic. Took me around 45 runs I think to get it.
---
What up? I'm Jared. I'm 19. And I never fucking learned how to read.
---
You have obviously never multiboxxed.
---
I don't have exact numbers for WoW classic but let's use some numbers that are probably going to line up with most games
---
Money earned per hour 100 gold, money to get geared 1000 gold, expenses per hour 5 gold
---
So you play one character for 20 hours, you earn 2k gold and pay off your gear and expenses and are left with 900 gold
---
You play 6 characters for 20 hours you earn 2k gold each and pay off your gear and expenses and are left with 5400 gold. This is also including cost to gear characters, each hour after this skews heavily in the favor of the person farming more efficiently.
---
Why don't you make a 10:03 youtube video about the point of this post and not needing to stir up hate

---
SotC judgement makes SoC do more damage, but it's not enough for regular mobs since they die too fast. I'd personally put more points into imp SotC because it's better than SoC if you have a fast weapon.
---
Depends when in the cycle. Mages get tailoring for Robe of the Archmage during MC/BWL, but they only need it to craft the thing. They can drop it and pick it back up when Bloodvine comes out.
---
Everyone needs Engineering though.

37 here :) 
---
Excited to relive the summer of 2005 :))
---
You won't be getting raid recipes on alts as often.
---
Yeah mate. Sounds truly.
---
If his game chair is on a hard surface, get him some roller blade wheels for his chair.  I think my set was 35 bucks on Amazon.  It lets you roll around smoothly and silently. 
---
 Best purchase I've made in a long time.
---
This is exactly why i stopped making videos. It just seems redumdant to put out information that will have to be remade.
---
You people just dont get it because you havent played the game recently. Early on, sure doing a 4 hr MC raid with people in greens and no consumes is fine. But in later stages, you are wanting to do MC , AQ40, BWL and multiple ZG and AQ20s all in one week. It is a nightmare to get this done if your MC alone takes that long. Even with highly optimized runs its alot of content to get through. Its not like retail where you just stop doing MC when BWL comes out. This is where putting effort in to speed up runs really helps.
---
There's always gonna be clipping bud
---
When it first drops it's gonna be ridiculously fucking hard.
---
Got 34 days of PTO so might as well use em.
---
And yes, I've got runs and routes planned out and tested.
---
Because that's how I enjoy games. I over level JRPGs. I spreadsheet clicker games. I like to know how things work so I can make them work for me.
---
I, too, was mulling over the idea of breaking the ToS since this part is rarely enforced.
---
lol so much for that!
---
As a prior Maplestory/Ragnarok Online player, join.  It'll be a blast, between questing and just grinding on some mobs in an area for a bit to get a level advantage.
---
Sometimes it's fun to have a mutual cease fire and help eachother. If I have the opportunity to help someone do a harder quest and then kill them after I'll do that for luls. Otherwise I follow a pretty simple formula.
---
My #1 targets are people playing optimal pve class/race combos. I would rather help pvpers, which I guess is a bit ironic.
---
#2 is hunters/locks since they basically have training wheels on while leveling, no sympathy. If they are gray I'll just kill their pet.
---
#3 Mages who are doing aoe pulls because I'm jealous and petty.
---
I agree with this. Duo leveling with a shaman is nuts. Windfury+sweeping strikes+ cleave+ whirlwind. Big pulls and windfury means you actually have the rage to do it all.
---
Enjoyed this video more than the last thank you! The Chinese gold farmers farmed the first area because they were bots and dead wind was basically deserted and they could do it without getting reported. The active ones often farmed at Tyrs Hand.
---
I'm a bit sceptical about your dad's ability to stunlock at the age of 70
---
For my part, I hated resilience because it just felt so... game-y. It hurt immersion by outright acknowledging (in-game) that player characters were completely different from NPCs. If Resilience at least worked on other humanoids, I'd have been fine with it, because then it's an internally consistent world. There were weapons which did bonus damage based on the enemy's creature type (Demon, Beast, Undead, etc.), so armour that protects more from certain creature types (in this case, Humanoid) would have also made sense.
---
You roll Orc for the stun resist...
---
People living mid raid is the toughest part.  And after a few bosses most people won’t want to get locked in.
---
That... would be exactly why he wanted to mod it in.
---
I never played EQ but I always hear things about how brutal it is. That's a wonderful example of such brutality.
---
3 rogues??? Scum!! All of you.
---
Just kidding sounds pretty fun.
---
I wish they'd use the same server names so I can find all my old raiding buddies.
---
&gt;As someone else so elequently explained in this sub, resilience is a  stat that I dont feel, and makes my opponents see 40% smaller crits.  It's not fun for anyone.
---
A stat you don't feel? How is it that you don't "feel" the damage mitigation coming from resilience, but you do "feel" the damage mitigation coming from armor? I am a bit confused here. You're overexxagerting btw. It's not even close to 40%. It's more like 20% and most people don't even play that much resilience in their optimal gear. And even if it were 40%, how is that different from armor mitigating your crits? Or resistance lowering your spell damage/forcing partial resists. Care to explain?
---
&gt; Classic pvp was great. The inclusion of resilience didnt magically make  pve and pvp completely independent. 
---
It sure was great. But it was different. You can't really compare classic and tbc pvp, because they both go into completly different directions. Classic pvp was purely fun based and not competitive or balanced by any means. Obtaining rank 14 also had literally nothing to do with a player being more skilled than others, it was purely a time investment. 
---
Don't get me wrong here. I liked classic pvp, and still do. It's fun. But that's all it is. Fun. There is no system in place to measure skill in classic. And even if it were there, it wouldn't work at all, because classes weren't designed to be competitively viable in pvp. Oneshotting or stunlocking opponents to death sure was fun, yeah. But was it a skilled thing to do? Hell no. 
---
&gt;They still certainly had to consider  pve when buffing the damage of a move for pvp? 
---
Looks like you got me wrong there. Might've been my bad tho. English is not my native language tho I might've argued in a wrong way. Yes, obviously they'd have to do that. What I meant was that they could adjust the resilience values of new items in order to adress class balance issues. Not that they could change class mechanics without having to consider both pvp and pve. They could also do changes to resilience in general. Remember when dots where a big problem in tbc pvp? Good we had resilience, because that allowed blizzard to nerf dots (in pvp) as a whole without having to mess around with class mechanics. 
---
&gt; Additionally, I would argue that arenas put a microscope on balance that  simply wasn't necessary before them. As a result, things like  resilience had to be introduced to "save the day" from problems that  weren't present before. 
---
I agree that resilience wouldn't have been necessary in classic. But that's not because those problems weren't present before. Because they certainly were. They just weren't an issue because classic pvp was not meant to be truly balanced or fair. It was meant to be fun based on the way it was played. It was fun for warriors to oneshot things. It was fun for rogues to stunlock things to death. And that's fine. Nothing wrong with that. But tbc took a different approach to tbc, making pvp both fun and competitive. Which you prefer is personal preference. I personally like both, but on long term I'd choose fair fights where both involved parties trade strategic attacks back and forth, trying to find that opening and punish mistakes, over the straight up overwhelming that happens in classic. In classic many fights are decided without the other being able to do much. In tbc that simply does not happen. Both parties, at all times, are responsible for what is happening and can react to certain actions being made. 
---
Was resilience 100% necessary to implement in order to achieve this? Absolutly not. Was it bad to implement it? Absolutly not! You might think different, but I don't have less fun in a pvp fight because I see a 2,2k crit instead of a 2,5k crit. It's the end result that matters to me. Also I liked that you could play purely pvp and wouldn't be at a disadvantage. If resilience wasn't there, pvp players would be forced to play pve in order to compete at the highest level. This wasn't the case with dedicated pvp gear. Setting a solid foundation for all players to compete.
---
the wait what is obviously refering to the fact that holy paladins can do the same you twat
---
I think you're really underestimating how easy it's gonna be in blues. Once a decent bit of the raid has T1 yeah it'll be a cakewalk, but before that ehhh...
---
&gt;Recent retail ban is bad news for classic
---
No it isn't.
---
Unless, of course, you want to break the ToS (which you have to abide by) and illegally mod your game - then yeah, I get it is bad news.
---
For you.
---
That's the joke tug yer nuts
---
I highly doubt there will be Naxx pugs.
---
That's what I was saying. They can start with say, 5 servers and then add 1 or 2 more per week or day or month(probably need at least a month to see the trends imo) to have enough capacity
---
The groups I PvP'd with in Vanilla had a WW2 veteran in it. He was 82 back then.
---
So most of the players can't access the game ?
---
As someone who played Legion because friends begged me to I believe the reason they deleted PvP realms from existence is because they broke the world. There aren't set zone levels because shit now scales with your level. Want to fully explore the Burning Crusade content but can't because you out level it too fast? Not anymore! Now you can level there regardless of being 60 or 90!
---
And lets not forget that being a fresh max level you get one shot by geared max level people. Stupidest shit I had ever experienced, I was a DH tank and was **still** getting one shot at max level.
---
Having things scale only invited an ass whooping and the sheer gear difference also made it to where a geared 110 could just rofl stomp a bunch of fresh blues 110's. People were tired of getting fucked.
---
True, but how many of them do you actually need? I mean, how many crafting profs are actually efficient.
---
If you're minmaxing to the fullest, Engineering and maybe BS/Alch/Tailoring is better, but horribly to grind for without an alt with Epic Mount, and now we're talking absolute endgame
---
Between pally and druid, running a hybrid spec where you can heal dungeons or even MC while also being able to do pvp as ret or feral, which class would be able to do this better? I've been discussing this with a few people and have heard it both ways
---
&gt;a lot of players in 30s/40s given the lag between when vanilla was played and now
---
Yes, and I will be i of them. It will be interesting to see the community culture develop with many older players returning. I'm hoping it will be more relaxed and friendly, less drama, and a whole lot more funny.
---
Soon™ er
---
Raptor. No contest. I'm rolling either paladin or shaman, though. The latter is going to be either orc or tauren, so unless I plan my leveling to get a head start on darkspear rep, no raptor for me.

As a BM Hunter from the TBC era, I know that feeling all too well. It was always the same complaint: "Your pet is doing all of the work!" I mean, come on.
---
Pretty simple really. Double the debuff slots meaning you'd be doing way more damage, you wouldn't have to pick and choose what debuffs you had on the target so you'd have every single person with all of their dots, curses, or bleeds up there which would probably cut boss fights down by a considerable amount of time. Boss fight times are a majority of the difficulty in classic since healers run out of mana. Tanks run out of cool downs and dps starts to slow down even after the first few seconds.
---
Basically if you speed up boss kills you take a whole lot of the difficulty out of the kills.

Khadgar - Alliance
---
Nokken from &lt;The Fellowship&gt; and then later &lt;Legacy of Honor&gt;
---
I'll never forget the day they changed the disc priest talents and power infusion changed the server meta. 
---
So many mages were my best friend that day lmao.
---
Also lvl 29 twinks facerolling players who were getting their first taste of wsg. 1 shotting casters was pretty fun.
---
30 y.o. here as well, turning 31 in two months!
---
&gt; You have obviously never multiboxxed. It very much is 5x more efficient 
---
lol in fact I've multiboxed retail for years, pay for 40 accounts to multibox, and have spent hundreds of hours researching for mulltiboxing classic!
---
You 'obviously' dont know what you're talking about. For the overwhelming majority of multiboxers it will take at least 2-3x longer to level 5 characters to 60. You are just talking out your ass because you refuse to let go of your opinion on the matter.
---
45 yr old here. Just don’t have time to keep up with all the releases. I’ll be glad when classic comes out so I have a fighting chance to not feel totally behind.
---
I really don't understand how anyone could be against being able to change hairstyles, it's an extra goldsink that doesn't affect anyone else
---
.. the joke is ret is bad cause holy is better.
---
you fail to grasp that he's not giving a shit about how good holy is.
---
there's going to be ret paladins in your BG's and no amount of shaming is ever going to stop that.
---
people who play ret wont play holy, because they dont like it. Get over it.
---
just like there will be arcane mages, ferals, chickens. All of it. And when you REEEE at them for playing it, they will mute you and keep having fun
---
a) better than having too many servers and having dead ones in 6 months.
---
b) for the #nochanges crowd this would feel like Vanilla launch where servers were constantly full with queues or crashing repeatedly
---
c) they can easily spin up new servers _immediately_ if needed so if queues are extraordinarily large they can do that.

No vanilla launch  was different, the playerbase grew overtime which is the opposite of classic

Everyone should be able to play on release. The best option is to merge the servers later imo.

---
Not really classified if so many people farmed the ogres.
---
While I can deffo see #nochanges, I don't think I'd hate it if they decided to just go ahead and buff "off-spec" tanks and damage dealers, and then if needed also buff the encounters to compensate. Vanilla is great, but balanced it was not.
---
Kodos baby!  Gonna get my Hummer back.  Looks so, so good with an Undead riding on top.  Was Black War Kodo (from PVP) in Vanilla or BC, cant remember...  Either way, I'll grind Thunder Bluff rep to get one somehow.
---
Sure
---
He may have only played after Cata.
---
Early 40s here
---
Yes, thanks:)
---
Did you do a lot of twinking? I was considering dabbling in Classic.
---
Laughs in Pally talented into lasting judgment that bribed RL into letting him keep up JoL up the entire raid.
---
  &gt;Best guilds will clear Naxx within couple of hours of it coming out.  
---
  You have no fucking clue what you're talking about dude.  
---
  Naxx is absolutely ruthless, it needs an insane amount of preparation just to start raiding it and a single wipe can ruin hours of work.  
---
  Then there's several off the wall things like the 8 tanks, which is not just getting 8 tanks but having 8 tanks perfectly geared for naxx, which often meant that guilds would steal tanks from each other.
---
\&gt;  Just image a normal raid from wow today and ever wipe cost you like  30min-1h farming time most guilds will just break from it, not to  mention how impossible it is so replace players quitting. 
---
So true dude.
---
You put that so succinctly man, kudos. I feel the same. I wrote a bit of a rambling post a couple days ago about this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bhd8ql/my\_favorite\_part\_of\_classic\_wow\_is\_the\_lore\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bhd8ql/my_favorite_part_of_classic_wow_is_the_lore_and/)
---
Rogues shouldn't duel.
---
They wait for the paladin to engage something else then attack.
---
Hi, Satan.
---
If you would like to continue discussing the problems of the "I do because I can" philosophy, specifically in the context of a game played with other members of the community, then I am here whenever you are ready.
---
This already is a change you twat
---
Yeah I can see that! I just remember getting my raptor and being like “whiplash”
---
Kind of even, both are pretty generous in terms of flexible talent points. Both are pretty good for that
---
I recommend it, but I guess I'd also recommend getting a taste of World PvP if you haven't experienced Vanilla World PvP. 
---
With WSG and twinking, I had my 29 rogue and that was it. It was pretty easy to get items as I was in a progressive guild. It was a massive money sink though (I think it was like 350/400g after I tipped my enchanters, paid the people running me through the instances etc). But, I can still remember certain events with my rogue in wsg years later so it's definitely worth it if you can do it right.
---
I am seriously considering rolling an alt first and seeing how things play out before I settle on a realm, faction, race, class, professions for my main. I want to see some realm stats first.
---
Shitty as it sounds, if i wanted a quick run or something i'd definitely be guilty of doing this.
---
49 here, and once I heard Classic was going to be a thing I knew I would jump back into WOW again.  Played Lock/Priest/Pally up until just after Cata was released.
---
I believe if you talk to the quest giver, he has an option to click that gives you more information on her whereabouts. Anyone remember this?
---
&gt;Also, while I don't know what they did to Illidan in retail, your depiction of him isn't vanilla either. He obviously doesn't appear in vanilla, but in WC3 he fought against the Burning Legion and against the Scourge, and was last seen getting beaten by Arthas. At that time he was probably the most interesting character, so BC turning him into yet another evil raid boss was one of the lowest points of that expansion.
---
I agree with this completely. They took every major TFT character and wrote them out of the story:
---
Kael'Thas
---
Lady Vasj
---
Illidan
---
TBC lore sucked so much.
---
The difference is between what's good for the Raid isn't necessary what's good for the individual player.
---
LC is not designed to reward each player in 1 evening, maybe not even 2. But give the overall Raid a greater success of achieving their goals.
---
This looks like a well organized LC, I wouldn't want to join LC that just randomly gives people Items. You need some sort of statistics in the background.
---
I will never join a DKP Raid again. Most of the Classes will do the Loot Council themselves for the Set Items, so they don't loose too many DKP.
---
They will not get smaller upgrades, because they hoard their DKP for Trinkets and Weapons and maybe sometimes this little bit more Damage or Heal, could be the difference between a wipe and a kill.
---
People tend to only look out for themselves when DKP is involved.
---
Which makes a lot of sense for this system.
---
But LC can be tricky as well. I will do some long talks, before I join a LC, but this looks pretty great to me.
---
If you don't trust your Guild, who do you trust in WoW Classic? Elves?
---
I got into playing shortly after BC released so wPvP was slim to none 1-60 but when it did occur, it was a lot of fun. So I'm really excited to soak that up this time around when everyone is restricted to the ground and the same zones.
---
S-tier meme
---
When thwy vanish, their dentures remain
---
lol they're super bouncy that's for sure
---
Cool, now all level 60 early content will go from sort of easy to RoflcopterFacerollLFR level ez.
---
Seriously, just buff the early lvl 60 content / lvl 60 5-mans blizzard to account for 1.12 talents + massively buffed itemization!
---
In b4 “No Changes” 
---
Cuz we can’t have any changes to counter these non-blizzlike changes cuz &lt;insert brain dead idiotic reason here&gt;
---
Good to know 100% my class, race, looks and spec the moment i learn of classic
---
the real choice was my primary alt mage or hunter
---
went for hunter because aspect of the cheetah and a alt with a pet is pretty cool
---
oh god i can see the shit storm that would cause.
---
\++ :D
---
I mean that was his closing question, usually people end with the kicker
---
Hah I had a rogue named Cruz on Gorgannash and I used to kill hunters with my gun it was pretty funny
---
Fair. The drop rates in classic might be slightly higher or lower. But all the items shown in the guide will still drop. The purpose of the video was to show some background lore surrounding the location and a potential gold/hour to be made. Which I believe is going to be very close.
---
merging servers is an _awful_ idea. It ruins communities, economies, and achievements.. imagine you're on a low pop server and about to get Scarab lord, then Blizz decides to merge you into a bigger server where another guild is 5 steps ahead of you... you'd be pissed! Better to just trickle the servers out over time.
---
It operated as a ghetto vanish for a few xpacks around...  I wanna say Wrath/Cata/MoP?  I'd have to check.  It didnt wipe aggro or remove from combat properly in pve though.
---
My friends and I all have plans to make it into the same nursing home once we're old and decrepit.  We figure by that time the days of Bingo and Horseshoes should be long gone and it'll be like a 24-7 LAN party.
---
If you're in a PvP zone and I'm in a PvP zone I'm attacking you. You might be level ?? to me I'm gonna hit ya. You might be 10 levels under me I'm gonna get ya. 
---
It's just a good time.
---
Better than not being able to play at all
---
Why not 19 bracket?
---
Not in this case because you can always go play retail while you wait.
---
Hi, original "Wait...what?" guy here
---
"there's going to be ret paladins in your BG's and no amount of shaming is ever going to stop that."
---
Well I plan to be Alliance, and I also dont really PUG when I do BGs, so no. There will not be a Ret Pally in my BG. 
---
Because Ret Pally is objectively bad and no amount of whining you do will change that.
---
I don't see how a few months can be that relevant considering most of the surge of new players happened during TBC/WotLK, at least that's what numbers and surveys indicate. There's truckloads of PvP servers started before and after RP-PvP realms that have died off entirely.  
---
&gt; Their communities are current rather closed and while some are happy with classic others are quite hostile. 
---
All the more reasons to believe the RP-PvP community does not have that many members and would be better off playing on either PvP or RP realms - from a healthy population perspective, not an "me and a few buddies want this, please give it" perspective. 
---
I get people's feelings on the matter but there's rational decisions at stake here and I don't think Blizzard is very keen on starting any servers under the likely premise that they will die in 2-3 months. Their hostilities don't mean anything on any significant scale, no more than the hostilities of the hundreds of people who were crying for changes on the forums for instance. 
---
&gt; Now obviously the biggest issue clearly on the EU side is multiple languages
---
Lol I wasn't even factoring that, it would be damn near impossible to release it that way.
---
Learn as you go.
---
?????????? it doesn't work like that lol people want to play classic not retail.

It‘s hilarious how people suggest that WoW is a skill-based game. I recommend checking out pservers where duels are literally decided by ignite rng procs and tidal resists. Btw, feel free to duel me with any class on an arena or duel server. I‘ll show you how good you are :)
---
Thank the light!!!

[oh lawd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsRjQDrDnY8)

You sound like one of the people that preordered Anthem. Don't start sucking dick until the game releases.
---
Agreed. RIP TB.
---
Dynamic spawns outside of the first couple weeks of launch is a hard no from me. Dynamic spawns were introduced on pservers to accommodate their inauthentic high populations. I want authentic populations. Sharding in starting zones for the first few weeks of launch will in all honesty provide this better than dynamic spawns and overcrowding will.
---
Increasing the debuff limit increases overall raid DPS, which further trivializes content. This is already  a point of debate going into early content with later patch itemization, threat, and debuff slots. While this might make more specs a little more viable but it would be at the expense of the actual content and authentic experience. I would counter by suggesting people be team players and learn to contribute what the *team* needs.
---
Well too bad for them because that's exactly what they will do. They aren't going to release a fuckload of servers, they'll shard the starting zones for release day then taper it off and only make new servers if the demand stays steady. Anything else makes zero business sense.
---
Blizzard went from fleshing out their own stories, to stuffing them chock-full.  
---
I think a lot of it comes from the urge to constantly top what has already happened. They seem to think every raid and expansion needs to be bigger, more world-ending than the previous.
---
When Ret Pallys qualify is DPS I will. They are much more comparable to shit tier healers than shit tier DPS
---
Get the fuck out of this sub..
---
A....summoning stone?

no it doesn't.... classic tosses a bunch of nonsense abilities at you that you can and will waste time using.

He means Repentance, which is not a stun. He also seems to think a Ret Pally is going to put pressure on healers.
---
Basically he has never played the game and hes a big Esfand fan.
---
is that really one of your best memories of the game??? good lord.
---
I can't wait to play this game again and *not* be retarded. I don't get all of this nostalgia about everyone sucking hard. the game was great and it will be even better with a good head on my shoulders.
---
\&gt; access to patch 12 gear earlier
---
They said they're only gonna release gear (which wasn't in the launch game) on the same patches that the gear was added to loot tables/vendors.
---
Ventrilo and IRC, im kinda happy about discord beeing in the picture today, its a good "merge"
---
&gt;I definitely was planning on texture and model swapping

So you were "definitely planning" on violating the TOS you agreed to when installing and starting the game, and now you expect sympathy?

You gotta be kidding.

TBF, people that are not interested in RP may join RP servers because they tend to have a more laid back attitude as far as with things like progression and less silly names that might break someones immersion. Blizzard likely isnt thinknig that EVERYONE in an rp realm is going to rp. Though they are likely assuming that the people that are joining RP realms for the community attitude arent interested in pvp. IDK if thats a good assumption or not, but I can say that the only reason i might pick a pve server over a rp one is for pop size.
---
It's very cool. But that's nothing.
---
I didnt realize that. If it doesn't come out until BWL that's honestly a pretty big blow to Hunter itemization. Getting your Phase 1 bis bow in phase 3 when the chromag crossbow becomes bis seems...detrimental to the experience.
---
I have universal basic income so.. A lot.
---
I mained a rogue then, main a rogue in retail and will play a rogue in classic. That parts easy for me. Professions on the other hand...
---
Nightsabers, best looks and perfectly smooth animations.  
---
But I’m going Orc Shaman so I’m filled with false hope for a Zulian Tiger
---
I think he’s talking about the summoning stone
---
That, too, though having the Surgers charge around was a far more common issue for us.
---
I love posts like these because I always get to say
---
YES! Classic is the perfect opportunity to get into the game. New players breathe life into wow, especially when it comes to vanilla
---
Do you play on a certain illegitimate server that rhymes with Gronos? They changed the game for terrain and knick knacks like trees to cause LoS. This was not in Classic. A house can be used for LoS, a tree cannot.
---
The entitlement is reaching new highs and spilling over from /r/wow
---
People act like the only thing you do in a raid is press that frostbolt button against a wall .
---
You have to move, decurse, know when to pop potions and CDs.
---
Will my next spell overaggro? Can I use frostbolt or should I wand /scorch to stay on low threat?
---
Do I have mana to cone of cold/ firrblast while moving, thus trying to use all my gcds?
---
There are so many little things that make great dpses the reason why they're great dpses.
---
 &gt;Multi boxing, broadcasting and botting are 3 seperate things
---
Wrong.
---
Multiboxing and Botting are 2 separate things.
---
Broadcasting Keystrokes is simply a technical prerequisite for Multiboxing, which is **perfectly okay as far as Blizz is concerned**.
---
There simply is no rule prohibiting you from running 6 instances of the game client from the same machine. And there is also no rule prohibiting you from changing what DirectX sends into those instances input buffers, as long as that doesn't result in you automating any tasks (Which would be botting).
---
So you may as well quell your rage, young one, nothing good will come from it.
---
.
---
They already stated that they weren't going to mess with community aspects. I expect no xrealm BGs until phase 6 if ever.
---
Ye Classic-Wowhead needs to get updated you could always check the items on Classicdb but ya I can see how that isn't as convinent.
---
Yeah dog horde or alliance? Do you remember Vires Veneratio or The Mediocre Men?
---
There is so much information available and there has been so much time to absorb it, yet here we are a couple months from Classic and this sub still thinks Ret Pallys (and Enhance Shamans for that matter) are worth a shit in BGs.
---
Get to 40 and sell portals!
---
&gt;drown outside of Orgrimmar, run through Felwood - jump down at horde base in Bloodvenom Falls. Run to the boat and when you port you'll be ressed on the boat. Try to run through the tree, you will get killed by guards - run through the tree portal as spirit and continue to the graveyard by the inn
---
We're talking 2 deaths, and I was at the dock in Auberdine at 22min. Then I was killed and ran from south Darkshore, over the water and through the tree. So a little over 30 min.
---
Nah
---
Not yet, but there appears to be some demand. I'll PM you when I get ready to do so. :)
---
They unbanned everyone so that shows it is. They don't really care as long as it isn't affecting things like looting nodes or changing anything other than your model.
---
No was on the light one. in ashenwale particulary
---
Alchemy and Herbalism.
---
Oh no, I shall do .2 dps less than the engineer. What a tragedy. \*sob\*
---
If you'll excuse me now, it's time for my daily money shower. Also, my epic mount collection gets sad when I don't visit my mansion at least every other day.
---
same dps as rogues without buffs, in similar gear.
---
Nobody did. They reverted all the bans with a "warning" because they actually don't give a shit about model edits just for characters.
---
You're gonna be drinking every 3-4 pulls most likely, but you can conjure it so take solace there. It sucks (eating tbf) a lot more on something like a warrior.
---
I hadn't planned on it, but there seems to be some demand so I will probably do some for the people on this sub. I'll PM you when I set up a way to do so!
---
♡
---
Just did it again on \*\*(rhymes on Southscale) - run over the water in spirit form, then you can run through the tree and ress in Dolanar. What servers have you tried on - done this so many times on so many hunters?
---
Curious to see if Tier 2 drops from Molten Core as it did in the earliest days.
---
''You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor'' I love southpark :D
---
Play warlock if you want a caster. Pet tanks the mob and you can life tap if you get low on mana. Priests with spirit  tap are efficient too.
---
Dude he cleared it on his european pserver. He clearly knows what he is talking about.
---
I drink, therefore I am mage.
---
Here endeth the lesson.
---
&gt;in fact I've multiboxed retail for years, pay for 40 accounts to multibox
---
I also multibox except I don't pay for the accounts because I earn so much gold, sounds like you do indeed not know shit.
---
Even at 2-3x longer you're still playing 2-3x more efficiently than others and it isn't near that. It is often faster.
---
if you wont ever see one, why do you act like it matters what others do?
---
Did I miss some post about WOTLK classic? Why all this talk about Naxx?
---
Thanks :)
---
I'm sorry to hear that. Might I ask why you bother to continue this conversation with minimal effort if you do not seek discussion?
---
Ret paladins casting freedom on anyone but themselves?  That is a rare occasion indeed.
---
Sure, just need a little time to setup everything. I'll PM you when I get everything going!
---
Eh, an hour or two to grind the gold, then buy the mats and get 300. Not too bad. 
---
*You* probably don't need every recipe, but it's always nice for the guild to have one crafter of each kind.
---
So good
---
Right, I've never tried a melee class so I'm guessing eating after every other pull is annoying also.
---
1 The only good horde is a dead horde
---
2 Don't kill fellow druids. The Cenarion Circle don't like that sort of carry on.
---
3. Greys aren't worth it
---
You havent seen pirates of the caribbean? They dont need boats when they can walk on the seabed :D
---
The dead be comming... It just takes a while
---
Can someone explain the efficacy of redoubt, shield specialization, and improved devotion aura? In both pve and pvp.
---
Improved devotion aura is less than 200 armor. Is that like 1% damage reduction? Who knows how armor works... 
---
Shield specialization increases block value by 30%, which is flat damage reduction when blocking, right?
---
Sounds decent.
---
We understand that tanking raid bosses isn't smart, so let's not talk about different defense and crit. But redoubt might be good for 5 mans and aoe, and it leads to shield specialization.
---
Bottom line: for the paladin that wants to put points in protection, and do some normal activity, pvp and 5 man tanking, is it better to get imp devo or spend 8 points in the shield talents?

Oh yeah, there's a reason they can create it. Haha. Even creating a mana gem can feel like a 2 minute process. *Make water, drink, make gem, drink"
---
There are caster options with less down time, Warlock is probably one of the strongest options.  You lifetap all your mana, suck health out of enemies for more lifetaps, drain mana directly, or suck it out of your summons.  They don't have any down time.  You can chain pull mobs until you pass out.
---
Priest with spirit tap is manageable, but nothing like a Mage.
---
I want to be known as the friendly mage charging really low for food/portals. Charging low will give me more customers which then will lead me to become insanely rich while being known by E V E R Y O N E! Constant invites to dungeons/raids for being friendly will be great.

It's a far fetch but I want to makw a reputation for myself!

We are creating a guild focused on older players.  7pm - 10pm EST raids.  Let me know if interested!

hey great post.  we are building a guild focused on older players.  pvp server, 7p-10p raid times.  let me know if interested!

Oh, I figured it's because noone gives a flying fuck about these long-haired, jobless, self-proclaimed  "Content Creators" who create videos about literally nothing.
---
But no, I see now that I am wrong and it's because it'd be *redundant.*
---
It's really up to you. The pattern is hard to get and in a less-than-optimal dungeon in my opinion, but it's definitely a good long-term goal.
---
I probably won't be bothering with it though. Too expensive in time and resources for my taste personally.
---
Baron mount as a holy paladin. It is a perfect match for I am a dwarf!
---
When raiding you buff the group arcane intellect buff twice, on two groups, then you have to drink up because you are oom. Repeat 4 times. Then you are done buffing up.
---
If you spend 30 seconds making waters before a dungeon, you’ll have so many that you can freely blow through them without worrying about how much they cost or stressing that you were stopped mid drink because the tank pulled—my pet peeves on my priest. It’s lovely in comparison on mage.
---
Get up to date with the wc3 lore... Or better yet, play wc3 untill classic. Great story, great game.
---
Other then that, go in blind
---
Playing wc3 also help to get a feel for the races
---
&gt; I also multibox except I don't pay for the accounts because I earn so much gold, sounds like you do indeed not know shit.
---
So you also know that loot is now shared among 4-8 characters, and that herb / ore can be shared by anyone who loots within ~10 seconds and that's like 100,000x different and more lucrative than in vanilla, right?
---
What happend?
---
EU or US? Horde or Ally?
---
 I’m 30 and I’m looking forward to the reunion of the classic players who I assume have “grown up” a little, at least for the better.
---
Idk if you are trolling or not but fwar is considered the pinnacle of dps in vanilla. Making them useful always in any group almost
---
Early on you're going to want to be pulling with frost bolt and then using your lesser/greater magic wand to kill enemies. Later on you'll be able to clear entire areas with AoE. You'll also be able to run and drink at the same time so you can cut down your drinking time between pulls if you spec single target.
---
Ohemgee has a really good video on higher level WSG strategy
---
Not sure if troll, but Naxx was originally released in Vanilla. They retooled it for WOTLK because very few players were able to experience their finest work.
---
Haven’t seen something this great since:
---
https://youtu.be/aBKqNt5ysq4
---
40 level 100 people wiping on bosses with little to no mechanics for 2-4 hours
---
I get this as a parent with kids who only ever want to play fortnite. 
---
 I actually took a picture of them at the computers the other day Incase there is a ever a “fortnite classic” remake in 15 years time so they can show it off on Reddit.
---
Was Naxx in Wotlk a joke compared to Vanilla?
---
Lol im balding 24 and have a full time job putting rebar in like a monkey.  I wish i had hair and i wish i could do youtube fulltime for a job.
---
You seem extremely mad its a saturday bro relax
---
I had never played WoW before and I started on a private server and I loved it.
---
They’re in demand for raids and you won’t have trouble finding a spot. And they’re a blast to raid with, I hear. They even offer support to the tanks like each doing a sunder on pull so tank doesn’t have to spam it. 
---
For dungeons during leveling however the fact is if you are unwilling to tank there is a strong chance your whispers may be ignored. I’ve tanked 1-55 so far as 2h wep fury and later MS spec because the fact of life is a warrior forming a group is less likely to bring someone who’ll “steal” all his gear at none of the effort of tanking instead of a dps who is cloth or leather. 
---
There’s no excuse other than someone just being uncomfortable tanking dungeons. That isn’t an inherent bad and you can either go about your life as a leveling dps warrior getting into groups (but not every one) or suck it up and get tanking basics down. But you’ll get lucky if it’s a Druid tank, they won’t care at all!
---
You're a fucking idiot.
---
On private servers, if I get ganked by someone that is 10+ lvls higher than me, I will log into my character on opposite faction and kiss ass and compliment them and then they usually leave me alone after that. For example: “Hi fren, I am
---
That little homeless undead mage that you absolutely slaughtered 5 minutes ago, could you please spare me? By the way, you look super cool in that awesome armor and mount, I hope you have a wonderful day fren.”
---
It's the 7.3.5 client which doesn't support 8.0 features. It's like saying Vista should continue patches from Windows 7. It doesn't work like that.
---
Shit I love sad movies. I must watch this. Nothing better than romance anime lol. I’m too old and married to like this shit but I do. Sigh haha
---
Personally, I'm not against them expanding Azeroth. Draenei and blood elves could join, as long as they can't be shamans or paladins. Likewise, they could expand incomplete zones like Hyjal.
---
Check out Kargoz on YouTube. I think he had some stuff on doing warrior, paladin duo leveling suggestions.
---
I think the way I would think about doing is thinking about how you can enable the warrior to do as much damage as possible and keep them alive? I suppose doing a holy/ret spec would be good. Maybe something in holy/prot but more focused on enhancing the warrior. Keep in mind that the warrior scales up in damage if he doesn’t have to worry about his health and gets a lot of rage.
---
this is retarded
---
Right. That’s what I assume - but I’m a little more interested in spells like Mind Flay or Arcane Missiles. I thought at one time, Blizzard was going to make a “que” for spells, so the last tick of these spells would go off before starting a new cast, eliminating clipping. 
---
Now, I haven’t played in years, so I wasn’t sure if that mechanic has changed or not, so with the new client I was hoping it would still work the same as it did in vanilla.
---
I always draw the same parallels spot on.
---
This is really good advice. Remember OP, you can tank basically any dungeon as Fury/Arms (Prot might be smoother at first when you're max but it still isn't mandatory) as long as you keep a 1h+shield on-hand, so having the option is really helpful if you aren't against the idea of occasionally tanking. It will help gearing up a shitload especially at max, if you're willing to offtank UBRS or tank a share of your BRD runs or whatever.
---
Don't worry about changing factions, I started in wrath as Alliance then went to horde in MoP and stayed horde since then. Even now with 12 lvl 110 and 2 lvl 120 on the horde side, I will be playing Alliance on Classic, mostly for nostalgia purposes. I still remember walking in Stormwind back in Wrath being in complete awe. I necer felt that with horde and I want to feel it again when I start my character in Classic.

Me either!

I wish boomers would self identify in game somehow so I can corpse camp them al day. Fuck boomers.
---
tbf, if you hate downtime, vanilla wow would be a hard bone to swallow for you. 
---
the game in general is quite slow paces with a lot of downtime and waiting, in many aspects. not only classes individually and leveling, but gameplay in general. traveling, gathering groups, waiting for people, waiting for quest bosses etc. etc.
---
vanilla isnt an action rpg game (which is modern wow), its mmorpg.
---
Horde of course!
---
No. I’m asking a legit question. I’ve only been a priest. I know that warrior dps is huge. For me, it’s more a question about tanking and the ‘role’ of a warrior, about whether people will say ‘you should have rolled a different dps class if you don’t feel comfortable tanking.’ That’s the comparison to SP. Back in vanilla, people would ask me why I didn’t roll a lock if i want to dps.
---
Additionally, if you have a good/trusted healer buddy, tanking leveling dungeons with a two-hand weapon is actually a lot of fun, though it’s a little more advanced and you should you have tanking basics down with a knowledge of threat gen and enemy tabbing. Whirlwind axe crits give you hella rage, although it’ll be a little trickier when you don’t have prot tree additions like defiance, and shield slam for stuff like ZF or Mara. But entirely doable, and people are often impressed. And of course sword and shield for bosses or oh shit pulls.
---
Me and a buddy play games every night on teamspeak typically aram on league of legends. We are and will be awaiting classic to play. We will roll alliance and we play pretty much 7 days a week after work 12-3 am. Eastern time. We are night owls. If your interested send me a pm!
---
What percentage of honor, compared to a lvl 60, would you recieve from that same person if they were lvl 48?. I hear that the later 55-60 zones might suck more in that setup but wouldn't BGs release in phase 2? There's no way any coordinated effort would reward more in world pvp grief farming over a bg premade, once bgs are released. 
---
I also feel like the amount of people that would focus honor farming in WPvP camping is small compared to the other groups of people that will be dungeon farming or gold farming or profession farming or any other plethora of things you could potentially spend your time on. I think a certain level of the WPvP of vanilla as an experience needs some level of griefing. All of this is also only an issue on a PVP server, not PVE. I really don't think they need to change anything related to it
---
Depending on what you expect from the set. Pvp set has basically more stam Overall, so will still be a bit above dungeon level item in pvp. However it’s going to be less interesting (appart a piece or 2) for raiding as you don’t have any piece with +hit, which is the main star to obtain
---
Don't believe everything that is on internet.

I'm sorry this wasn't more clear in the original, because I feel like I wasted your time.

No because one person gets scarab lord but with time and patience and time and more patience you can get thunderfury. I don’t understand being downvoted for having a plan to be able to fund my warrior MT and his gear. Seems a bit petty but I don’t expect any less from some of the shitbeads on this subreddit.

This is genius, but I didn't expect to see my name in the dps logs. Shoutsout to Symposium!

Just go through the raids on here. Take a look at where warrior places. Tends to be at the top.
---
I wish the above website was pinned just to reduce the number of posts like this :P.
---
I mean people will say that regardless. For the most part groups will take 1 melee dps, maybe 2 in certain dungeons. Rogue vs warrior is a toss up. Tanks may get uncomfortable with you, I don't like fwar when I'm tanking cause they fight me for gear.
---
And you cant understand why you've been downvoted.
---
the blue pvp set is a little better than tier 1 for most classes.
---
I'd be interested, if its horde and PvP.
---
Was on thunderlord too. Forgotten horde.

Did I miss something?
---
&gt; I doubt there will be MC pug raids.
---
On private servers people pug MC, Ony, BWL, ZG, AQ20 and AQ40

I was downvoted by said shithead. Mad because someone has a plan that they think is dumb. I’ll play my way you’ll play your way.

Uuh, do I need to have watched that movie?

At least 2-3 hours per night most nights. Long days on Sunday.

use a wand with 1-2 frostbolts
---
&gt; If you were to give a new player suggestions on how to join a premade what would you tell them?  
---
1. Follow instructions e.g. listen to your target caller.
---
2. Focus objectives.
---
3. Always think ahead of the enemy (try to predict their next move).
---
4. Communicate.
---
5. Know every class - their strength and weakness.
---
6. Be independent when necessary.
---
7. If you are a melee, don't overextend during mid-fights.
---
8. Evaluate after each fight - what worked and what can you do better?
---
9. Think before you make any actions e.g. sometimes its wise to just ignore, say, an enemy healer if you can see he is oom, even though he might also be in execute-range.
---
10. If you are leader of the group, always make sure to fix your groups e.g. shamans and warriors goes in same group for WF, etc.
---
11. Learn to pass the flag to your flag carrier, and if you are the flag carrier, learn to pick up the flag. Again, communicate.
---
12. Always have an eye on your flag carrier and alway assist him on mid and when necessary.
---
13. Same as 12. but for your healers.
---
14. Guide your flag carrier - call out incomings and let him know where to run.
---
15. If you are the flag carrier then learn the map, learn to juke the enemy, and let your team know when you are in danger. Call out repicks if you think you are about to die.  
---
These are just some basic tips ontop of my head so it's no way near a full list of things to consider when playing competitive. These tips are not in a prioritized order, as all of them are equally important imo. Anyway, I hope this can be useful for somebody, and I should probably elaborate some of the things but eh.. should be pretty self-explanatory most of it tbh. In the end its just a matter of learning by doing aka. git gud.
---
You can run while drinking if you have excess inventory space for a bunch of water:
---

Sometimes i /wave and just let people be. Sometimes i gank lowbies. Totally depends on my mood tbh
---
You don’t get last stand not spend 1 point into improve shield block? Are you only tanking adds in raids?
---
That's awesome!
---
99% of fury warriors only do marginal OT duty in raids. Some tanking here and there far and few between like tiger boss adds in ZG, maybe a corehound, Garr's elementals, majordomos adds. So in most raids it's one to three bosses you tank in part of the fight until you switch over to the boss when the adds are nuked.
---
However in dungeons you are better suited to become DPS when you have a guild you farm your preBiS with. In a set group with a dedicated resto shaman a warrior DPS is more desirable than a rogue due to the rage mechanic being favored by windfury totem. 
---
In pugs it will be harder but not impossible. The thinking of a pug tank will be: "Eh, I most likely will have to bring one melee to appease the clothis so they dont bail immediately or go into the run discontented. So I better bring a warrior as he has better damage with WF than a rogue.". Just be aware that you will never be allowed to roll on tank gear, while the tank will  most likely roll on fury DPS gear and tank gear while roll need on some shield here and there for "nature resist gear", when in fact the 3g just look juicy and he knows he can get away with it.
---
Uhh.. 30 yr old looking for raiding/pvp guild with those exact raid times. Been planning to main a horde druid for heals since classic was announced : )
---
Yes there are levels where grinding mobs for exp is more efficient because of quest availability, notably levels 45-60 involve a fair amount of mob grinding
---
I really REALLY hope they don't use sharding... I can't wait to see 100+ humans running to goldshire day of launch...
---
Kargoz has some original content. Good dude.
---
Vanilla was the only time I played horde and I want to do it again. Alliance races all look the same and I only play it because a friend of mine who got me back into the game after I quit the first time was alliance. However alliance has better zones so I'm conflicted. Like Dusk wood alone is better than the top three horde zones put together.
---
They only unbanned everyone because the initial wave unintentionally caught a lot of innocent people who were not using it for the exploits they mentioned. They have since said that if you use it going forward, they won’t be nice about the punishment.
---
Yes and it will Be soon enough. So OP you should not worry to be trash as you will need to clean MC until domo and have the chance to loot the leaf and be the first one in the guild to have it... and all of this before the beginning of phase 2.
---
American DPSycho.
---
If they release it late its a massively screwing over communities that want to roll RP-PvP now - we have waited for official servers long enough and all of us want to play at our home.
---
You have no evidence that they will die in two to three months - if anything RP-Type Servers have always been stronger communities just smaller in general.
---
I read somewhere that 1.13 is based on the 8.x, so why should the API be 7.x then
---
These are really helpful responses. Thank you for taking the time to post them.
---
This post is really ~~smart~~. By "increasing time" it takes to do a raid, you're by definition increasing the difficulty. Longer fights, bigger gear check, more likely that players make mistakes etc etc.
---
Just call it what it is - you want to buff raids. And it won't happen.
---
Thank you, BeaStanellosGhost!
---
If you are not willing to tank dungeons then you'll have a harder time gearing up because you can be sure most tank warriors will refuse any DPS warrior to roll on their loot while they are doing all the efforts.
---
That will be the case sometimes during leveling but that's definitely going to be the case most of the time when it comes to pre-raid BiS. Tank warriors are the kings, they make their own groups and rules and DPS warriors and rogues will rarely get a spot because they compete for the same items.
---
I'm set on Priest as my main and after that I'll make a Paladin.
---
Nah you were downvoted because of your post was completely a waste of space and just shows how uneducated you are about the differences between Vanilla, Classic and Private servers not to mention your terrible attitude. Happy Redditing..
---
I tried really hard to play as a dps war in vanilla.  I was always required to keep a tanking set in my bags and I used it fairly often.  The best thing to do is get into a good guild early that plans on raiding and become THE dps warrior and make sure everyone knows that when its time to start doing raids.
---
It doesn’t, blizz was already pretty clear they were releasing gear as 1.12 versions a month ago.
---
Their latest just clarified to what anyone paying attention already knew.
---
Use K R O N O S bis lists. Their itemization on k3 is the same as classic wow.
---
This question could be relevant if fury warrior and shadow priest was in any way comparable in terms of raid setup. Most raids run 8+ fury warriors while only 1 shadow priest gets to join *some* raids, and that generally only happens once warlocks become powerful later in the progression schedule.
---
How much would you charge for something like what is in this photo?
---
What faction, and how many nights per week are you thinking?
---
Undead Warlock with a Mohawk and his tongue hanging out is the only real option.
---
Yeah, what others have said, plan on sitting down to eat/drink every few pulls.  Your best bet would be warlock for least downtime, using lifetap + drain life to not stay at 100% hp but kinda hangout around 50-70%.  If you alter your rotation sometimes you should have a lot less time spent drinking.

I can only talk for me and share my experience but I have played horde from Vanilla close beta to end of BC. My Wife, who was playing on the alliance side repeatedly asked me to join here but I felt the same way, a treason of my friends and the horde.
---
Since LK I decided to join here and found my place in the Alliance with new friends, and discovered another part of the game, like the second face of the game. 
---
Not sure this will happen to you but this is my personal experience
---
Now 30yo, then 15yo..
---
I just realized that majority of the player base will be around the age of 30, according to a poll I remember seeing.
---
Which can only mean that majority of guilds will also be of the 30 age pool, with a good amount of older and of course younger as well. 
---
*But*.. this gives me hope for maturity in groups. Classic WoW may just be an entirely different game then what it was, based on maturity alone! There's hope people, there is hope.
---
That's amazing
---
Yeah but let's see him do it on his mage though.
---
If 28 counts as older for you, that sounds pretty fun! Do you need a sub for the vanilla servers?
---
I'm waiting till Classic WoD, I know 10 year is a while but I hope it's worth it!
---
I'm in a constant battle between dwarf priest healer or dwarf warrior tank. Have played both to max. Just.. torn..
---
I've gone with priest healer tho for my life being different than what it was 15 years ago. You know, adulting, responsibility... bleh.
---
You can invest in getting a good wand or finding a quest that gives a good one. I think at level 20 you can get a really good wand from a bfd quest. That alone will help alot in mana. One of the biggest things that will help you on this is finding people doing the same quest as you and grouping for the quest. Not everything in vanilla is soloable like in retail wow. But if you want a class that doesn't have tons of downtime go hunter or rogue. Rogues have some downtime early on but once they can start stunning they don't have as much downtime and becomes alot less eating intensive.
---
No. You pay a wow sub to play wow.
---
I would fucking hate a clown like you. 
---
I refuse to let fury warriors in my 5 mans. Regardless of my class, a warriors first job is to tank, for if no tank we don’t do an instance which makes your fury spec fucking useless. A warrior can tank any 5 man in phase 1 as any spec with a sword and shield on...if the warrior tanks, and I refuse fury warriors in the group...the warrior gets all the prot and dps warrior gear. And if you refused flat out to tank I’d kick you from my guild. 
---
Want to be a fury main? Great. But your first role is tanking, if only 3 warriors show up for raid—sorry bud, you’re a tank tonight. Same with spriest. If we run 11 healers but only 9 show up, my spriest is healing. In naxx, many of your warriors will don their tank sets and sword and board in fury for trash or even OTing bosses. 
---
Dps warriors are needed and desired in pvp bgs. Big health pools, snares, ms and big dick Dps.
---
This is classic wow, not bfa learn to play your class, not your spec.
---
Dorf ladies are crazy thicc though
---
Rofl, from my previous guild :D
---
Okay so making alchemist alts is a bad investment why? If I have the time to reach 35 boost them to the point of being able to have multiple arcanite bar transmutes that’s a legitimate strategy to make gold. My mention of my goal to be able to fund a MT and generate the resources for thunderfury aren’t wrong and yes I know it’s not a guaranteed drop but if you keep working for something occasionally you get it. Why discourage someone from playing the way they want what good does it do does it just scratch your suppuriority complex?with attitude like yours I’m sure you’ll think oh look at this noob he thinks he’s just going to get thunderfury with no work but clearly I didn’t say that. I know it’s not something every warrior gets but I plan to work towards it and all my goals for classic wow even if it takes years why because It’s what I want to do and will have time to do. Have a good day I’m done replying to you.
---
Maybe try and bribe Blizzard into making gnome hunters a thing in vanilla then.
---
Nope not at all dude
---
&gt;However, I really don't have the money to pay for a subscription of a 15 year old game . 
---
If you have never played WoW, does it matter how old the game is?
---
I know, but we're talking about classic, and that's the way it behaved in classic. You also don't need these macros at all, even if its toggleable or not, because using an ability (with or without having enough mana, rage, energy) will start an attack.
---
Tbh I would imagine that's just PR talk so they don't have to say otherwise. They've "let" people use it for years without anything. I don't use it, nor would I, but I don't think they care honestly.
---
I feel like I have no patience for tips. He just always seems like he is the worst about pushing for time

Get a job. $15 a month isn’t much

You can play for free until level 20 then it's $15 a month. Per hour it's a pretty good deal as far as entertainment goes.

They gonna shard stormwind.....

For what shitting on the people actually doing something for the community instead of doing nothing but complaining like you?

Get a job. My first job was @ 14 and I saved up and bought my first gaming PC so I could play Diablo 2. If you want it bad enough you will do what it takes to get $15 a month.

Oof. But then you have to play a gnome

At launch strat and scholo were not 5 man dungeons.  Possible but not without an amazing group.  Packs were huge and very close together.
---
You guys aren't alone.  My dad will be joining my brother and I for classic, he is 63.
---
Have an upvote that made me laugh. Yah whippersnapper b
---
Im laughing so fucking hard that you think you'll be able to buy your way from 1-300 anytime soon when servers launch. Thats a riot
---
Turning war mode on gets you nothing but ganked if you're not the dominant faction. If they inbuilt a wintergrasp style buff to counter the faction imbalance that would be something but as it is today war mode is just a giant failure.
---
It's not subjective to want the powerlevel of PVP to be how it was in vanilla.

You may

op is obviously trolling us.  this is a baiting flame.
---
No, there isn't.
---
The only alternative would be to gold farm on modern WoW and buy out WoW tokens. The $15 sub includes both games, so if you know how to play the AH or can find some really effective gold/BoE farming spots, it'd be easy. 
---
In NA, WoW tokens are ~120k, which isn't all that hard to get in 1 month. I have a feeling the prices are going to jump quite a bit when Classic comes out when all the die-hard Classic players dump their gold stack into tokens.

no better time
---
Who said anything about server start?
---
Negative. Barrens is the superior 2nd zone.
---
I go to barrens I don’t leave till stonetalon, ashenvale or alterac.
---
I show up in West fall and I’m bouncing between there and loch Modan and redridge.
---
No dude they’re all just reading the post word for word then blankly staring at the camera for a few minutes to hit the ten minute mark. Absolutely disgusting behavior.
---
r/socialism ——-&gt;&gt; that way
---
I mean, why not? We're all adults, making small exceptional changes just because an item name sounds funny seems rather petty to me. I just think it's sad.
---
Barrens has cool memories and nostalgia but you cannot seriously put it in the same league as duskwood.
---
Was name changed all the way back in 2008. And with good reason.
---
1-20 sucks on a Druid. Gets better. 
---
Lock, Druid, faction specific, and priest are always the 4 least played.
---
But given how verbal some folks are regarding how shit hunters are in exclusive late game pve content, I’m interested to see how often hunters are rolled.
---
To play legal wow it cost 15$ you will be getting two games for that sub fee while I understand your finicial situation wow had always cost 15$ a month.
---
Your argument was that it's not fair. Something being fair or not in one's opinion is very much a subjective matter.
---
That's just natural selection
---
Why do you bother stringing the conversation along if you do not seek discussion?
---
Expect a lot of downvotes from the feelgood “play what you want” crowd, but you are 100% correct. 
---
If you are not willing to do anything but DPS, roll a DPS.
---
Totalbiscuit.
---
Mail boxes
---
Just have those on an alt and have actual beneficial professions on your main.
---
Since we know it will be on patch 1.12, it will be "normal" 5man, that was farmed for orbs, like featured in most of the gold farming guides.
---
As a leveling zone, duskwood actually sucks. As an aesthetic, it is very cool.
---
Over half the quests are on the other end of the zone. The green dragon area makes it a roundabout journey. Most of the spiders and wolves are so low level you can’t kill them as you run as they don’t give xp. If in the graveyard, it’s actually faster to run to sentinel hill and fly back.
---
Mace drinks a lot, it’s one reason aoe farming is so much better on them since you’re killing 6+ mobs between drinks instead of like 3.
---
not just here....this is right up there with the Vince Mcmahon/bodybuilder gif as the gretest of all times
---
The average of WoW player in 2005 were 28.
---
Mental maturity may vary regardless.
---
I’m 31, but was 17 when I started playing wow (around the 1 year anniversary of the game). A quick google search shows this would have been patch 1.8. It is going to be surreal traveling back in time to a game that hasn’t existed since very early 2007. I bet there’s going to be a lot of people playing in their 30s, 40s, and 50s.
---
Your spell ranks for conjure water/food are always slightly behind the vendor equivalent until lvl 60. So while leveling you not only will have to drink after everything you do (even after conjuring the water), there will be some level brackets where the water is woefully underpowered and slowing you down.
---
Mage is a great class with lots of tools but drinking is a constant battle.
---
Ah thanks
---
This will be our generations version of "old people meet once a week to play boule"
---
18 is the level where rogues get ambush, turns them from a noob into a proper ganker.
---
Well then Barrens sucks for questing too because it's too big, comes before your mount, and had too wide a level range.
---
Only keep what useful, sell everything else on auction house and use that to buy better bags.
---
The bank Alt / Mule
---
Play whatever class you want. But learn your class. Don’t learn 1/3 of it and walk around like you’re good—cause you’re not. Wanna be enhance? Great. But your class is a healer first, if needed your first responsibility is to heal. Wanna be fury? Fantastic. Keep a prot set handy, you WILL be called upon to use it.
---
Were we specifically referring to premades?
---
You're right that you will probably run out of inventory space while levelling if you stray far from town. This makes bag upgrades really valuable, especially if you have a gathering profession.
---
Generally speaking, when my inventory starts to clog up, that's a good sign that I might want to stop by a vendor to sell gear and repair. If I'm far away from a vendor, or don't want to stop my questing for whatever reason, I just try to estimate how valuable the various items are per stack, then just trash the least valuable items to make room for higher value stuff.

You all are welcome to join us! Our Discord link is https://discord.gg/cKTzVz

If you don't plan to use Discord I can still add you both to our roster. I'll answer any questions you have!
---
I'd expect competency in a premade, but I don't think those were specifically mentioned in the post I was replying to.
---
I would agree, except for now that addon has been altered to allow it exploit things they won’t allow. So the bad actors who morphed that addon into what it is now have ruined it for the innocent people using it for their RP/whatever that Blizzard tacitly allowed in the past.
---
Linking the nicker in chat is an important part of the vanilla experience. No changes
---
The guy who saves AB matches from being headless- chicken-HK-derpfests.
---
Not sure why you'd need a classic suffix since the game will be a separate client. You won't be able to see realms that aren't classic.
---
But I do feel they should be named the same as the original.
---
Barrens gives you quests that often allow you to complete other quests on the way or on the way back. Barrens has superior leveling circuits. I can typically find yellow mobs to kill while I run. 
---
But again, I’ll agree all day how much better Elywnn, Westfall, Redridge and duskwood ‘feel’ in terms of rpg, mood, setting, etc.

"Classic WoW is getting released sooner than expected."
---
Why is that in the description? On what basis? Most are expecting August/September at this point.
---
it seems you might want reword that to "Classic WoW is getting closer upon us" or something, as that quoted line is pretty misleading.
---
Lol? 
---
That’s like saying your love Seattle/NYC/LA/Houston traffic because it lets you know you’re not alone.
---
Oh... Just read the news! Looks like I have some work to do! 😅
---
I'd say that this is the best opportunity ever to get into WoW if you never tried it! This is the game that changed the entire gaming scene and kicked off the MMO craze back in the days, and you get another chance to experience it if you missed out back in 2005/2006!
---
For someone who never played WoW, I can imagine that it's easy to think that Classic/Vanilla is a "bare bones" version compared to current WoW. Nothing could be further from the truth. It blows my mind how complete the vanilla experience is. The world is filled with content and there is just so much to discover that it may take you years to "master it"/"see it all"!
---
On my journey to 60 (Warrior and Shaman) I never felt I had to grind to level. My quest log was constantly 20/20 full and I didn't even bother to quest in several zones. Still hit 60 no problems. I'm looking forward to leveling to 60 again soon! :-D
---
I hope I'll still get to thrust my [Large Slimy Bone] in someone's [Lifeless Skull] in chat.
---
So your a speed leveler. You basically don't really play the game to have fun. I do, and that's why duskwood is better.
---
Yay! Finally some more changes to implement! :-D
---
Most likely not.
---
You need to watch the movie because it's phenomenal.
---
nope
---
Not in the spirit of vanilla imo.
---
This is true, pugged all recently on a mage except aq40.
---
Something about a slippery slope
---
ya, its funny how quickly gamers, who are normally pretty normal right wing, turn /r/accidentallycommunist when it comes to paying for their games
---
Really?
---
Is he dead?
---
I don't think it will be as cut and dry as you expect. There are lots of people who have already completed MC and remember everything about it, but there are just as many that don't remember a thing. 
---
There will be some hardcore guilds that only recruit people who practice raids on private servers and they will have Ragnaros down in record time. But most guilds will be a mix of players all with different knowledge, experience, and skill. It can be a hassle just to get 40 people to show up on time every week, and so sometimes you take what you can get.
---
There will also the cocky bunch that think they are ready and that it will be a breeze, and so go in too early, undergeared, and receive a big wake up call.
---
There's no queue.  You can easily cancel your last tick of those spells if you don't time it.  There will likely be [no channeling] macros to help you out with the new API but who knows.
---
It was tightly tuned due to how bad everyone was. Mc and bwl allowed for roughly 1/2 your raid to be dead and get a kill. The first nef kill on my server was 25 min, because most of the raid died early. We routinely did ony as a 5 man once we were farming bwl. 
---
The allure of classic endgame is aq, naxx, and pvp—im playing the first year so A) I’m geared for aq when it comes and B) so I always have the most ideal loot to face in alliance heads. If I wanted 500 wipe mythic raid bosses, I’d just go back to retail. But everything outside of raid hours in retail is a horrible experience.
---
Yep, the name was changed during TBC so The Blackrock Slicer shouldn't be a part of classic
---
/signed
---
You know, a 2 second google search would have answered your question
---
Or you could just tell me..
---
Cool, I was afraid you abandoned the project.
---
Sorta? 
---
I know I do not want to play a Paladin or Shaman unless they change or tweak numbers, so they're out. I don't want to play Warrior first because I'd rather have another class leveled with money so I can supply my Warrior so it's not TOO harsh. I've never liked Druid so that's out. Hunter is cool, but my friend said she absolutely wants to play Hunter so I'd rather not double up on the same class. 
---
That leaves rogue, mage, priest, and warlock. All 4 of those classes also have utility built into their class so making friends and helping other players would be super simple to boot. I don't like Orc, Troll, or Dwarf models in Classic either, so I know I'll be playing either a Gnome, Nelf, or Undead. So from here I just have to decide; if Alliance, Mage or Warlock Gnome. Rogue or Priest Nelf. If Horde, Undead whatever.
---
Druid is the easy choice for me
---
Just older, not more mature
---
This is cool, bookmarked for my classic fix.
---
Because even in Classic, fire always did more damage than frost.  I still had my nova, my instant AOE, and all that fun stuff -- but I just did a ton more damage in the instances, pvp and even raids.  It was just like the old "need at least +45 FR before you go into MC!"
---
Tbh I'm not sure why people are hating on 10-20 bear form leveling so bad. At that level range mobs die pretty fast even in bear form, and you will literally never die as a bear. 10-20 is not fast, but it isn't specially long either, especially since you have 0 downtime as a Druid (kill mob, unshift, heal yourself, repeat), even more so as a bear.
---
5-10 was way more painful to me back during leveling. Goddamn ***Swoops*** in Mulgore would win 1v1 against me sometimes, because of that terrible stun stopping me in the middle of Healing Touch and dealing way too big damage. 10-20 was easy. Past 40 though, using Bear is infuriating because you take like 40+ sec to kill a single mob. Horrible.
---
Fury Warriors are important raid dps and capable of topping meters.
---
&gt; Do 5 man groups ever take a tank and a dps warrior?
---
It can take a while to find a tank (warrior or feral), so if the group is sitting around waiting to find a tank then it can be very frustrating that the dps warrior refuses to equip a shield and tank
---
Please stay on xbox. Far superior platform.
---
Can't really compare wow to traffic.. Plus I don't drive.
---
What's the point of a mmo if you can't group up?
---
Good guy mod looking after us, as always :)
---
Im going horde because no blood elfs!
---
I always liked the Belf starter zone and Silvermoon. The player base, not so much.
---
I’m going horde since I’ve been alliance 90% of my time played because I want a different experience in not only a class but the lore and zones I’ve never experienced
---
If you make a Warrior and balk at tanking 5 man dungeons, you are shooting yourself in the foot; it would be like buying a Truck and never using the truckbed to carry things. You get WAY more opportunities to gear up yourself when you can form the group with no one to roll on your items. You're basically a walking dungeon finder. Message a Healer, and boom - you found a group. Now you can just fill the other spots with clothies and you're set.
---
Sure, in raids you'll be smashing face, maybe even in some 5 mans you'll meet some nice Druid who likes to tank - but it's going the path of the most resistance. It's possible but it's really going against the prime strengths of the class where you can utilize one aspect of your class to strengthen the other role. Even if you were a Shadow Priest you would be best served healing some dungeon runs to better yourself, not only in gear but in the ability to fulfill all the capabilities of your class.
---
Folks also treat you like royalty when you show yourself willing and able to be flexible. As a DPS Warrior it's already a challenge to compete against folks for gear, or even to find a spot in a dungeon group can be an ordeal - it's like hearing a Mage grumble about folks asking them to make them a Portal... when you could make some gold or make a friend, it's just going against the grain to not fully utilize the most sought after role in the entire game.
---
Classic DOA /s
---
"So you wanna duel, eh?"  
---
"Yeah, let's see what you got!"
---
"Beats them down as a holy priest..."
---
"Man, you're good."
---
"Yeah, and I'm 45, now bug off whippersnapper!   You just got PWNED by an elderly person!"
---
lol I thought this was a punchline joke.  all the time
---
You can play fury from beginning to end. You will always be less useful than the fury beside you that is willing to tank when he has to but you will still be there. They want you to dps they will take you for dps. You will probably not have a single issue not tanking unless your guild has some no shows one night. More likely in naxx than anywhere else.
---
I think about that a lot. Old people today didn’t have any technology or half the things we have today and so they mostly just sit in a chair and knit or fish or something “boring”. 
---
Fast forward to when millennials are in their 70s and 80’s,were all gonna be playing world of Warcraft and hooked to the internet and shit while the kids of the 2100’s are all robots and hooked up to cloud consciousness powered by google.
---
About 40 of us would app to this guild right now.  :)
---
Nothing wrong with two warriors in a five man on paper, problem is tanks usually dictate groups because they can basically pick and chose, they are always in demand. A dps warrior who bothers to tank is t going to want another warrior to compete with for five mans.
---
the last 4 ish point can all be interchanged to what u want
---
I understand that pain.
---
&gt;If they release it late its a massively screwing over communities that want to roll RP-PvP now
---
And how many does this community count? Can you find any substantial proof there are enough players out there to make this worth it? I don't see the thousands on retail servers giving much of a fuck about it, and there's barely anyone on the upcoming RP-PvP guilds to matter. 
---
If they announced they were going to remove PvE servers as an option tomorrow, you'd have 20,000 signatures on a petition in a few days and people would be losing their shit over it. If they announced they were going to remove PvP servers, we'd make it to the front page of Reddit with how much QQ from everyone. 
---
They give out all indications that we are not going to see RP-PvP servers because there aren't that many people interested in it and you get... 30 more signatures on that petition and a few hundred upvotes on this subreddit. 
---
Speaking as an outsider, it doesn't seem like there's that many who give a fuck. If there were, they would probably listen. 
---
&gt; RP-Type Servers have always been stronger communities just smaller in general.
---
Yeah but it's selfish to think your feelings and your community is enough to make a server work, because you need a constant influx of new players in order to counter the natural, normal, predictable flow of players quitting/taking a break from the game. You can't have a healthy server with 3-4 active guilds in total and maybe a thousand players after all the tourists quit the game 2-3 months in. 
---
Back in the day people were constantly starting out and so you always had people out in the world to do dungeons with - with Classic, we might see a surge of new players at the start, but after 2-3 months there won't be as many people picking up this game from scratch as there were 15 years ago when the MMO/gaming market was very limited. That's why we know, from private server experience, that something as low as 1000 players will not cut it. New players don't go to small realms - nobody in their right mind right now says "yeah, I'm going to skip going where most people are playing and/or where the best PvE guilds are for *insert any activity here/RP-PvP*" - history shows us that big realms tend to get bigger whereas small realms tend to get smaller. If you start out small, you will end up dead in a matter of months.
---
Improved Devo aura affects your whole party, not just yourself, which is why it seems weaker on a personal level. It reduces physical damage based off the following formula: 
---
&gt; Reduction = (Armor / ([467.5 * Enemy_Level] + Armor - 22167.5)) * 100
---
In 5 mans, redoubt just means that when you are crit, you will block more hits for 10 seconds/5 blocks. Block is pretty basic when you take bosses and uncrushability out of the equation. Mobs the same level as you have a 5% chance to crit you, and that will lower based on how much defense you have and increase based on the attackers attack rating.
---
In addition to the other advice people have (mail boxes, bank alts), I'd add the obvious  --  never *ever* ***EVER*** pass up a chance to vendor your trash.  Make use of every random vendor NPC out in the world to dump your unneeded junk at literally every single opportunity.
---
Personally can't wait for world chat to be less toxic/trolly
---
 * Make one or more "bank alts" that you can mail valuables to. There are way more mail boxes in the world than banks, and it could save your main character a lot of travel. (also useful for AH listing)
---
 * Keep track of which "vendor trash" items don't sell for much (there are addons for this too) and start destroying the lower valued items to make room for higher value items.
---
 * Pay attention to quest items that linger in your inventory after you don't need them anymore (I'm looking at you, Lieutenant's Insignia) and destroy them.
---
 * Sometimes you can process crafting materials to reduce the space they take up. For example you can turn 2 stacks of Silk Cloth into 1 stack of Silk Cloth Bolts.
---
 * Profession Bags (and warlock soul pouch) are a wash unless you carry enough mats to keep them full. If your choices are an 8 slot bag or a 14 slot Herb Bag but you only keep 5 slots of herbs then you are losing out on those extra 3 slots from the normal bag.
---
 * Sort your inventory while traveling so that you can quickly vendor, bank, or mail everything once you reach a destination. Empty your bags every chance you get.
---
 * Buy bigger bags every chance you get. You only get 2 extra slots per bag per tier but those 2 slots can quickly pay for the price of the bag upgrade.
---
I dont get it?
---
By he sounds of this post u want to play human warlock?
---
I think I'll play Ally. But I don't know what class. On the one hand I would like to play warrior because I liked to be a tank in WotLK with my Prot Pala, but on the other hand I think I won't have enough time for this class. So I'll likely take a gnome mage or rogue.
---
I was listening to an episode of BluePlz from 2005 and it really struck me how incredible the contrast is between the social atmosphere of the internet then and what it has become. 
---
Things went from "deal with it, pussy" to "OH GOD did I offend you? OH GOD NONO NO I AM SO SORRY!" in just a decade. An incredible shift.
---
Because it’s not funny and thinking so is insensitive to racism
---
You’re that guy that called the cops on the party for drinking huh
---
Other people play games different ways, it doesn’t make anything less fun (maybe not fun for you?). And they maybe just might even have differing opinions then yours. Just sayin
---
I want to play Warlock. I don’t know if I want to be Horde (Orc) or Alliance (Human)
---
Im not sure what you mean but to play classic you wont need to buy any of the expansions. You will need to pay for the subcription only so its not that bad.
---
Less neo nazi guilds for sure.
---
I remember a majority of 20-26yo in the poll, which surprised me since I assumed we would only be old farts :o
---
By his logic a zone that had nothing but quest givers who accepted immediately returnable quests for xp would be the best in the game. Do you agree?
---
&gt; and I think Classic would be a good time to explore the story of the other side.
---
"and I think Classic would be a good time to explore the story of the other side."
---
Horde if you'll primarily PVP. Racials. 
---
Alliance if you'll primarily raid. Salvation from Paladins.
---
Or get downvoted because the classes are made with specs. Saying a class a "JOB" first just because the devs didn't understand how to balance is just silly. What if someone likes how fury/arms plays? I don't want to play a combat rogue. I don't want to play a Caster. Don't wanna play a Ranged. I want to play a melee DPS and Arm/Fury is that. 
---
"yeah but tank"
---
It was changed because it's used as a substitute for a racial slur and it's an irrelevant weapon anyway. But you already knew that.
---
Some blue pvp pieces will become the pre bis for sure.
---
Rr/conspiracy would have a field day with the one to the right.
---
About 10 hours
---
But but... it won't be an authentic vanilla experience without Chuck Norris jokes in Barrens chat :(
---
Yes, he wished cancer on other people then got diagnoses with cancer and died himself. But he really liked video games so everyone forgave him when he got sick.
---
Not a native speaker here, can someone explain what's funny about the name ? \^\^
---
A few translations tools give something like "laughing behind someone's back".
---
As long as you are willing to tank when it's needed I'd say go warrior if that's what you really enjoy. I'd say the same thing about shadow priest and healing. If you aren't willing to heal when its needed then just go lock. You don't want to be that guy that prevents people from doing things when you are more then capable. I say this as someone who likes to play dps warrior too, but I absolutely tank when its needed dungeons and raids.
---
This brings about the question: what about the slavedriver's cane? Is that going to be in classic?
---
Throw shit away if it gets that bad.
---
Whys that?
---
Wow, uhm. Karma I guess?
---
Frankly how many R13/R14 do you expect to see on a server ? 20, 50 max ?
---
Many such people come out of the woodwork when this topic is discussed.
---
Fury warrs struggle for gear bigtime but do dps so easily.
---
It was the equivalent of 20 2018 dollars a month in 2004 AND you get access to retail. I think the reason Blizzard is bundling the two products is to get crossover between players, so I doubt they will release any separate way to play classic.
---
Nice! I played a gnome mage back in the day ... theres a good chance you killed me at least a few times either in the open world or in BGs lol.
---
Can't wait until I retire at 65 and just killed Onyxia for the 3000th time.
---
The classes that don't have downtime take longer to kill mobs as a rule of thumb.
---
I've spent about the last year trying to talk myself out of being a Gnome Mage. It's what I played in Vanilla, and I'm actually a pretty damned good Mage, too. Literally the best arguments against it I can come up with is Class Scarcity and tier gear looks like shit, and those are fairly bad reasons not to do something.
---
Only Priests on Horde can dispel magic. So your polymorph is going to stick alot. Polymorph is insanely strong. That applies to slows and novas, too. And sure, Felhunters can dispel on an 8s? cooldown and FAPs can be used, but you'll never run into a Paladin and Priest just spam dispelling each other and their surrounding teammates like you will on Horde side.
---
Because
---
Hat is so confusing about 1.12? Brs and strat were retuned before most classes even had their new talents.
---
Yeah same here.  I hate the idea of players just disappearing out of thin air.  Takes a bit of the MMO out of MMORPG imo.
---
Blizzard has a “Character Recustomization” option for $10 ($15?) that allows you to change your gender and other features not changeable at the barber in retail WoW. I wouldn’t be surprised if they made that available for Classic!
---
666, goat horn... Who the fuck knows :D
---
I was barely 12 years old when I started in 2005 and my longest serving memory was me wasting 8 months as a lvl 14 troll mage in Tanaris trying to kill mobs around gadget. My first char I deleted my HS as a lvl 6 ud Warlock and went to epl and couldn't get back...
---
Same. I have always played horde warlock but I have a soft spot for the short little guys. I’m just gonna play what my heart desires
---
And you're every guy complaining he lost his license for DUI, because
---
* It was only this once
---
* I am a good driver when I'm drunk
---
Most rules exist for a reason. Whether or not you agree with that reason is irrelevant.
---
Private server guilds will flock to classic and cause tons of havoc in the world so it won't be as nice as you think but generally better
---
Frankly if it could give a lesson of humility to pserver loudmouths I'd be OK to get a retuning so massive that I would wipe for a year in MC !
---
I'm a man of simple pleasures :o
---
I think Heart of the Wild / Nature's Swiftness 0/30/21 build for Druid is really strong for both.
---
Misconception.
---
It's the people who think this should be allowed who come "out of the woodwork", because guess what: You are the minority position here.
---
see your flaw there is praise has no monetary value
---
I'll only engage if they're close to my level and aren't fighting a mob. It is sport. I don't see the point in engaging when the odds are nearly 100% in my favor, just to be a dick.
---
With ranking, which I'm not totally read up on, this could change.
---
I work at a desk arguing with your boss as to how much it should cost to have a monkey like you install rebar. Having inane classic wow videos on in the background is nice when I am tearing through massive spreadsheets or looking a building plans, etc.
---
Every guy has a slightly different take on a 15 year old game. I’ve got hundreds of days played on pre Cata retail and pservers, I’ve likely played as much, if not more, than most content creators, and I disagree with their perspective on a shit ton of things involving wow. I dunno, I guess my point is they are no more useless to society than ESPN is, yet I see that in every bar in town.
---
Looks great, thanks for sharing.
---
Same here, think I will make a change from vanilla and go for UD rogue instead of Orc like I mained back in the day for that sweet WotF. I’m going mining/engineering for professions, mining will be nice for a steady income from AH and engineering since it was awesome in pvp
---
The multi-region was the best multiplayer experience I had but I could be lucky about it. I made friends for life in mostly Asian guild and that would never happen without pservers. I wish multi-region will be possible in the future for official games.
---
&gt;So what I want to talk about is this. If we didnt have a choice and would be forced to have a cash shop, how would we prefer it to be implemented?
---
In a magic fantasyland where servers are powered by Unicorn farts, because if they ever implement such drivel into Classic, my Subscription is immediatley gone, and millions of people agree with me.
---
Activision are an evil corporation, but they are not idiots. They know that the audience for classic doesn't lend itself to the milking they get from the brainwashed BfA players.
---
At least 1 RP-PVP server please. It is what I would roll on if it's an available option.
---
But that’s a small chunk of people, relatively speaking, diffusing over a much wider selection of server choices. I don’t mean to say that there won’t be assholes on Classic servers either. That’s part of the point of the community is that it does have its share of bad apples. But I think the private server community will spread pretty well over all the servers, unless most guilds choose to bombard one in particular.
---
Am I the only one refusing to play private servers or even simply play retail wow so i get the maximum nostalgia rush?
---
I think the FAP CD is 2 minutes.
---
You could FAP up to 30 times times an hour (playing a warrior :p ) ==&gt; 30 G / hour.
---
The components for FAPs are a bitch to farm : stranglekelp is underwater and you need 2 fishes per potion I think.
---
Shit, MC was like 15 people pulling 25 nose pickers most of the time in PUGs.
---
I’m looking forward to no world chat too. There are open channels you can make, but they only allow 50 people max, I believe.
---
So that also means more people in cities, going to /trade.
---
Tigerstrike Mantle dropped off a mob while levelling.  BiS twink back for a bunch of classes.  Sold it for like 2g on the AH, thought I made out like a bandit.
---
Hunter not topping dams get meter. Def not realistic
---
That’s a good thing. If I hadn’t started before, I wouldn’t be playing now. So keep on holding out!
---
Good day to you then. You know how to find me when you are ready.
---
You earn enough gold to pay for multiple accounts so that means you know what you’re talking about and I don’t know shit? Wow what a great argument! 
---
Since you want to measure dicks I have 50 million gold on retail right now but don’t bother paying for subs with gold lols
---
Multiboxing on retail and classic are very different stories dum dum. It seems like you don’t realize that loot quests are easier with a group on retail while on classic doing a loot quest with a group of 5 will literally take 5x as many kills and will involve half an hour of waiting for respawns. 
---
Getting angry and telling people on the internet how big your epeen is doesn’t change the fact that you have no idea what you’re talking about lol
---
I'd bet my house that 95% of people give no shit about what models players are using on their own system or that they broke an arbitrary rule.  
---
Topics that stray into human puritanical and/or OBEY THE LAW self-righteousness territory draw such people with their ears steaming.
---
That's instant unsub from me. Greedy companies are half the reason triple A gaming industry is shit. The other half is fans putting up with this shit.
---
Okay, stop.
---
I don't care. Just stop. RIGHT NOW! :-)
---
Yes I can agree with you, lets just hope blizzard opens up the right amount of servers
---
It’s a random guy not affiliated with a news organization or blizzard themselves... who cares if people who haven’t been reading blue posts on their own are mislead.
---
I feel bad even typing it after all the good work they did uncover Hillarys weird munch habits.
---
after a while there will be about 1-2 new ones per week per faction
---
Not to derail this too much, but the TCG idea I personally don't mind (you paid blizz irl money for ingame item) because buying TCG packs for WoW items was just an archaic version of loot boxes.  The issue I have was number of items available in Vanilla, which was really low.
---
I lost the list again, but it's a couple tabards and a few cheeky consumables iirc.  Mounts like Riding Turtle and Spectral Tiger were TBC.  So idk what the point would really be.
---
They're around.
---
They may be more like unicorns but they can be found.
---

Undead epic mounts. Prob gonna play gnome though
---
I was 16 when I started and 31 now so this post feels pretty accurate. There will probably be a lot of older people playing considering that back then a lot of the people I played with were in their 20’s or early 30’s and now this time around I’m going to be that “old” dude.
---
Oh it was you that were always leaving our dungeons groups because mom called for supper ? :D
---
You're trying to sell me Alliance Chad and I'm not buying.
---
If you put in the work that's necessary to become a competent DPS Warrior you'll be able to find a raid spot as a DPS Warrior. As a heads up, people will constantly ask you to come tank dungeons for them though and in my experience, the guild leadership will notice if you're not willing to help other people/the guild out.
---
The reason being what exactly, that the item name shares a bit of phonetic similarity with a common racial slur?
---
Outside of the SJW facebook-bubble, how's that a reason?
---
Should we ban the word "bigger" too?
---
My friend was an Alliance Chad he played a NE cause Swifty
---
Unless you're concerned about endgame rush only, there's a somewhat easy way around it. Come up with all races, classes and names now. When the game launches, make all of them customized to to your liking and once entire list is done, pick the one you feel like playing the most at that time. 
---
If it doesn't stick, you only lose few hours per character, chances are your second choice will become your main.
---
Theres a “bag vendor” in Crossroads. Hordies will be alright! 😛
---
2 per faction, 52 weeks a year, so in 2 years we would have 416 R14.
---
Add 90% of burn out and my first estimation was correct :D
---
They put WoW items in the TCG decks to get people who don't even care about TCG to buy them.  It worked incredibly well, basically first iteration loot boxes.
---
Wasn't a problem back then, why would it be a problem now?
---
They won't. They will look at all those subs and think "wow, all we have to do is keep servers running. Huh."
---
They don't have to create content, balance, etc. Just server maintenance and engine updates. The game will print them money. There's no need for micros.
---
If they do, I'll be out as I'm sure many will.
---
&gt;Fellow gamers, we'll have to accept a cash shop in Classic World of Warcraft. You're a REEEing idiot if you don't accept this inevitability.
---
&gt;However, I really don't have the money to pay for a subscription
---
Then get a job.
---
Hehe no.. that was my computer being slow to reboot..
---
If you play wow classic, make sure you have plenty of time to lose
---
I think his view was that barrens  has a more logical leveling path, "you're wrong I'm right " isn't really applicable when you are talking about opinions.
---
I’m blanking so hard, where is this clip from? Is it American psycho?
---
Ok I will buy that
---
&gt; Also, while I don't know what they did to Illidan in retail, your depiction of him isn't vanilla either.
---
I think in a quest Malfurion talks about Illidan. Iirc he says Illidan went insane while sitting on his throne in outland.
---
What's the point of this video : it's not a leveling guide it's just a talent template proposition ...
---
&gt;I'd bet my house that 95% of people care not a bit about what models players are using on their own system 
---
Wrong again.
---
Player models are one thing. Next stop is map textures, and hello Nurse, I'm looking through walls in WSG.
---
Manipulating the ingame models enables certain forms of cheating. Most players who are not looking for lame excuses to justify their sense of entitlement to do whatever they want, are not willfully ignorant of that fact, and this agree that it is a rule that makes sense.
---
It is worth noting that both of the locations mentioned in the video are highly known about and were heavily camped out during Vanilla. Your actual gold per hour will be nothing like what was mentioned in the video because of the high competition for relatively sparse mobs.
---
It depends on the release day. But I'd like to do one raid progress then stop completely. Playing the most of my free time as possible
---
If it stops dumbasses from spamming racist shit in chat then why not.
---
&gt;$15/month barrier to entry: Personally, I wish the sub cost was lower for Classic, but I'm just glad to be able to play it. Meanwhile, many who think the game isn't worth that at all, or would only play it if it was free, are going to be barred from playing.
---
The crucible that burns away 98% of the cruft. I've played subscription games and I've played F2P and it's like being amongst two different species.
---
Be the best fury warrior you want, I won’t be inviting you to my 5 man’s. If you want to play your spec and only your spec, retail is a great experience. 
---
If instead you strive to be the best warrior, you’ll probably have to tank sometimes, but you’ll actually get access to the dank fury gear you actully want.
---
Barrens being faster for leveling and worse at everything else doesn't make it better.
---
Big brain take right here. People were using it in a negative way so they got rid of it. That's it.
---
The name itself hold no significance so this really is a non issue.
---
&gt; If we didnt have a choice and would be forced to have a cash shop, how would we prefer it to be implemented?  
---
**Here's how:** Any way that they want because I'll be playing F R E S H on the second era of private servers.  
---
The amount of data we'll collect with Classic will mean private servers will be more blizzlike than ever before. The only missing ingredient will be the population, which Blizzard will hand deliver if they put anything like cash shop or game tokens in Classic.
---
&gt;however nothing beats farming ore as far as g/h. i remember farming 1000g for epic mount in a few days by simply running around winterspring/plaguelands mining.
---
So you were the guy running 2-3 minutes in front of me hence why I had a hard time farming thorium ?! :p
---
We could continue this "you're wrong I'm right" stuff and entwine it with a speculative debate but I'm right and you're wrong so I really can't see the use.
---
I'd rather have human hunters !
---
What movie is it from?
---
I'm sure you put a lot of work into this but uhh..1 hour with no written guide or timestamps. Going to be hard to get people interested.
---
If we allow the actions of assholes to limit what all of us are allowed to say, do or think, then our society is royally f\*cked.
---
2H Fury warrior is viable on Horde side with WF Totem, especially if you have a Bonereavers Edge
---
2h weps are really just for PvP. Warriors can make a 2h spec work ok on horde for t1/2 but by naxx every dps warrior will be 100% dual wielding.  
---
For PvP arms is warrior's only spec. While pally's main premade spec is Holy, Ret is pretty good as well - it's definitely not a meme spec like enhancement or moonkin.   
---
I guess that means warriors probably do get a higher preference to 2h weps over ret but it's not huge, really it probably comes down to how many pvp'ers are in your guild. If your guild stays together clearing naxx for a few months it should be pretty easy to pick ashb or MoM up.
---
That sounds amazing. Hopefully there will be a guild which I can call home like in the past.
---
Yep I’m thrilled it’s $15 a month.  This is a good thing.
---
&gt;but I'm right and you're wrong so I really can't see the use in continuing.
---
Your opinion has the backing of some angry cheaters who now no longer have accounts.
---
My opinion has the backing of Activision Blizzard and most of the playerbase.
---
Therefore, you may yell "I am righT!!!!" as often as you want if it makes you feel better, but you are not convicing anyone...not even yourself :-)
---
Nickers sounds like Knickers which are a type if leg wear.
---
Or the tank, too would also prefer to be dps, but someone has to do it. The selfish one is the dps warrior who refuses to tank—yet has all the capability to do so. 
---
We could have lived in a world where there’s two groups one with the existing tank and another with the fury warrior stand in tank. Now each warrior gets all the loot and 5 more people get into the dungeon overall.
---
USER HAS BEEN ELIMINATED
---
Wait till the Barrens Chat activates
---
How much does mowing neighbors lawns pay these days? It seems like one day a month of minimal work could easily cover the cost of a sub.
---
You can't reason with people who refuse to listen, they're mostly here to circle jerk each other and feel good about what they're going to enjoy.
---
The thing is, you won't convince them of anything and you'll just get downvoted endlessly even if what you're saying is true.
---
Just leave them be, they'll face reality eventually tbh, and those that won't will probably just end up ganking low levels or soloQ bgs because that's the only thing they can do.
---
Chill out Socrates. Its not blizzards job to mold society. Its their job to create an ideal environment for their customers to play/enjoy their games. Renaming a random blue weapon with no significant lore to it in order to significantly reduce in-game toxicity is a no brainer.
---
Of course you know all this though.
---
Says the warlock who does one thing and only one thing.
---
I for one would like to do both pve and pvp on some characters, or alternatively not spend a crap ton because my raid needs me as a healer.
---
This is not saying I won't pay for a respec, but it would be less likely.
---
Those who downvoted me act like they won't change a damn thing, you know they are, as long as it is kept to a minimum, and QoL is improved the game will be better for it.
---
Go play private server if you want Zero changes. I would like QoL stuff.
---
That is my point
---
I am like 99% certain
---
I have it narrowed down to priest, warlock, or rogue. I plan to start all 3 and rotate between them for the first few days until I settle on one. I like leveling alts anyway so I will eventually cap all 3.
---
&gt;I'm playing female gnome warlock with pink pigtails for sure. Going to mainly focus on pvp and become a cute little monster.  
---
&gt;I'm torn between a rogue and holy paladin alt because I really want to heal and stealth gank @ enemy cities. I'll most likely end up with a rogue as my 3rd alt.
---
People from other regions play on US servers all the time. It happened in Vanilla, it currently happens in Retail, and it will continue to happen in Classic.
---
You either mixed up the pictures or the text.
---
Dude, what did you even try to accomplish with that respond?
---
I think releasing Classic servers with the old names is going to be a mistake.
---
I'd say the same but I don't lol
---
Yes! I was also worried about the Alliance thing, but after playing and doing PvP on the pserver, Undead are really not that bad. Deathcoil works well, and felhunter silence can help take care of casters. 
---
You also get greater satisfaction when you win a 1v1 versus an undead as a gnome warlock.
---
Yes and private servers are not the same are they, they're hard-core gamers who have gone massively out of their way. Of course they're more likely to pug a raid.
---
What faction you trying to play as? And any class ideas?
---
The thing is that Vanilla has 40x40 world raids too. Or more. Think of Emerald Dragons, for example.
---
Play how you want just go into it with the right expectations.
---
In this case, your expectation should be to have the following conversation a lot.
---
Party Member:  Hi!  Welcome to the group!  Are you able to tank?
---
You:  I'm only Fury, I don't tank.
---
Party Member:  Seriously?  You can't just equip a 1h + shield and try?
---
You:  No.
---
Followed by you being kicked from the group.
---
As long as you're cool with that scenario playing out over and over, knock yourself out.
---
Yeah it's not really aoe levelling like mage, where you spend hours grinding the same packs over and over. It's more like cleave grinding where you just plough through quest mobs.
---
Now you are making me doubt horde. Aghh back to the drawing board
---
The vast majority of people I've spoken with who are under 25 years old are inculcated with this mentality. Our society is royally fucked and is going to become very authoritarian as a voting bloc primed to fear wrongthink give away their rights.
---
Lol ok
---
Sounds incredibly slow.
---
I fucking hope so but based on the toxicity of this subreddit I'm doubting it.
---
'Course I do, I am just too lazy to continue on my code right now, and dinner isn't ready yet, so ya know...using Reddit the way god intendet it to :P
---
OK thanks.
---
Do not have ungood think goodman, all is doubleplusgood in new world, all hail Ingsoc ;-)
---
That's true. I actually had an arms warrior do exceptionally well all into naxx. He had a few little tactics, but mainly fished for procs of sword spec and windfury by spamming hamstring while wearing the gloves reducing its rage cost, then would jump to 100 rage after a proc and use spenders.
---
Its likely that his method would be higher dps than 2h fury, but also basically restricted to horde only.
---
I almost wish I was going horde so I could do exactly that. Maybe in the future...
---
Eh fuck it. Have an upvote for being otherwise based.
---
Banking alts.
---
To nick something/someone means to make a small cut or slice, so a synonym of The Nicker could be The Slicer.
---
"Nicker" sounds similar to another very offensive word for black people, so people with the mental maturity of a 10 year old think it's hilarious to use the item link to make racist jokes.
---
Played warrior back then and I loved leveling up with sword and shield and protection spec. I didn't care one bit that it was slow going because it was just fun to block, dodge, and parry everything. Plus it was easy to find a group as a tank.
---
I would depending on the times u play. I will be playing a pally I play na and a night owl. Me and a buddy play everyday on league currently while we wait for classic. We play 12-3 am everyday. If that works pm me!
---
American psycho
---
Go do one to two hours of work for literally anyone you know. I know I could definitely come up with 2 hours of yard work for a 17 year old to do once a month I would definitely pay $10 an hour.
---
I had played vanilla and raided with some RLFriends, come BC, they stayed with this one guild that I was never invited to. Now in BC, they needed a few bodies to fill a gruul raid. I'm in all blues and I'm arcane fire, but not max in either, in all blues. This was also when you could stack elixirs, and being an alchemist, and knowing the exploit, I used everything I could stack. Still not sure how much of an impact it had, but if it was, that's on them for now showing up prepared.  Topped the damage meters, died no more than the other mages in full epics. They wanted me to join, and I reluctantly did, but not to raid, just to be with my friends. I was always resentful to them for not letting me raid with them in vanilla. I do like damage meters, but people that use them as the end all be all metric are dumb as dog shit.
---
Pretty sure this was planned as the raid after Naxx.
---
That will work for me, what time zone are you though
---
If you use Joana's guide and don't go super hardcore, you can do it casually in about 90 hours.
---
27 year old. Not old but happy to play and absorb your wisdom.
---
If it’s your first character—yes. 
---
In classic wow quest givers (sometimes npcs, sometimes drops from mobs, sometimes random clickable items in the world) are not made readily appearent to you all the time. There are a shit pot of “hidden” quests. 
---
Not knowing where those are will seemingly create quest droughts. 
---
That said, playing it like a real rpg and exploring will help you find a lot of them.
---
difficulty is a loaded word meaning different things to different people.  If you say you want to make things more difficult, you'll be met with the obligatory "things will be easy because of reason X - things are already known, 14 years of experience, etc".  That's happened in every re-tuning thread.
---
Buff raids?  If you can call it that.  Make things more "difficult"?  I'd say I'm not.  
---
Either way, the very essence of Vanilla was time.
---
If banning words would stop assholes from being assholes, we would live in an asshole free society.
---
Alas, it doesn't. And never has. On the contrary, such idiotic attempts at somehow shoehorning society into being better by "forbidding" certain words, only results in the assholes doubling down, AND using your attempt as propaganda to justify them being assholes in the first place.
---
Wanna make society less racist? Then start by punishing police officers who shoot people for being black. Round up the KKK and throw them in jail until penguins wear ponytails. And stop voting for assholes who use racial digwhistling to rile up their moron followers.
---
But banning words will not change a thing.
---
Vanilla WoW started a cultural phenomenon. It is THE game.
---
Best prot pally guide:
---
1. Roll a warrior 
---
(Made myself sad as I look at my pally main)
---
To be honest everything that everyone says they love about classic WoW here is just magnified in EQ yet no one really gives it enough credit. I know a few people who played on the classic EQ private server who came from WoW and had no EQ experience and ended up loving the game. One in particular went from being such a terrible player that no one would group with him to one of the most powerful characters on the server.
---
The best thing about the grind is you can often watch TV shows and such on a second monitor when you fall into stretches of time you have to grind it out :)
---
There is almost nothing that only drops one exact thing, elementals for example might only have a drop 50% of the time, 30% of it being a grey drop, 15% for a white, and 5% for the crafting mat. So on those databases, it would show double for all of them, so 60% grey drops, 30% white, and 10% crafting mats skewing the overall results.
---
This feels pretty random. Next time you evoke this meme write out a list in a text editor over the course of a few hours. Like 50 things for each side minimum. Then pick the 5-10 best ones.
---
I can't wait to see all the enchanters with their macros posting all the time... The social aspect of the game was one of the best parts.
---
Maraudon was only a setback!

I really enjoy your videos but often I'm curious as to your gear setup in the videos from time to time. How well geared a character is can affect the kills per hour as well as some other things. For example, if it takes you longer to kill the ogres in the video then you'd also take more damage during a fight and therefor have higher costs for consumables and more downtime. I dont have the information to gauge if this would be important enough to consider.
---
exactly! And if people have problems getting a quest mob or w.e then they have to group up, forces you to be social in the game and make friends. Also too, some people don't realize that you can't just walk up to a mob slap it and it dies like in retail wow.
---
I think based off of Ion’s latest tweet, we will be seeing high pop realms. We probably won’t see 10k but I think we’ll see 5k. Also, it’s going to be really nice playing with one region, although I will miss some of the Euros

Gelkis clan UNITE

You’re right I can’t compare playing WoW to sitting in traffic. But I can compare attempting to play WoW but sitting in a 1000 person queue or not ever getting tags when i do get in unless I’m a mage with Fireblast because there are 400 fucking people in the same 1-5 zones as me. 
---
Don’t shard cities, don’t shard contested zones, but let Elywnn and Westfall shard for the first 96 hours—so that I’m actually playing world of Warcraft, not sitting on the 405 inhaling exhaust fumes.
---
This post made me feel great. Im 26 and get constant hate for gaming.
---
Is this real life?
---
If you use Joana's guide and play casually you can beat his world record lvl 60 time - yup sounds about right.
---
Yes or no.
---
Even in "absolute endgame" you're not gonna be able to grind out enough gold tan hour or two... are you fucking high? No profession in vanilla wow can you farm mats to lvl 1-300 nor farm gold in a few hours to buy your self that... This isn't retail wow bud.
---
Gelkis all the way. You get a ring.
---
Can't decide between female or male dwarf pally. I like the animations of both. I like being a rare femdwarf, but their bullet breasts look silly on a lot of armor.
---
I just remember feeling like a wet noodle—same with warrior in that range. 
---
On my clothies and hunter I feel like it’s getting easier all the time from 10-20 on the Druid I just keep eyein cst form
---
The tank is the hardest slot to fill. DPS is the easiest slot to fill. Do the math.
---
Thats...Thats alot of items
---
The Leveling Guides say to side with Gelkis and kill Magram, so there will probably be higher competition for people who choose Gelkis.
---
Well 4 weeks would be 160 hours, or 6 days and 16 hours.  
---
If you played reasonably efficiently and focused just on levelling you'd be lvl 60 or close to it after a month.   
---
I don't know if I'd classify playing the equivalent time  of a full time job as realistic for the average player, but if that's how you describe it then sure.
---
The joke is always in the comments.
---
I prefer a raid leader to be at range to better survey the fight.
---
I prefer the ranges to be a dps so they’re not concerned with the constant whack-a-mole of healing.
---
None of the above is required to be a good raid leader.
---
Pick neither so you can run around as a rogue and pickpocket both endlessly

Here is a chart showing how many real world days it will take you depending on how many hours per day you play and how many days /played it might take you to reach 60.  
---
Days highlighted green are what the community has generally agreed are average played times for the average player. The quote is often "people generally hit 60 in 10 days /played"  
---
Yellow and orange colors are times that deviate more away from that average.  
---
Based on this chart, if I play 8 hours per day on average, and I am a slightly slower leveler who reaches 60 in 13 days played, it will take me 39 days to reach level 60.  
---
Cheers.
---
In case this point wasn’t clear, let me put it another way.
---
You’re a fucking idiot.
---
I loved that axe, got out of my way to get it when i rerolled to a warrior back in late vanilla. I could not care less about its name. But I sure as 'blip' will get it again.
---
Swift Bengal Tiger, model swapped on any faction or race needed :) yes it does match
---
Gelkis since they intrude the roads between the demon area and Feralas more than Magram intrudes on the other roads.  
---
I wouldn't bother with either since they're neutral by default and don't attack you.
---
thats good advice
---
Depends on class of course.
---
If you're playing a good class and super optimize your route, you can finish in 6-8 days played.
---
If you're still serious about getting 60 quickly but still take time to do stuff like run dungeons, maybe do some fun quests with friends that aren't super optimal, you'll probably take like 10-12 days played.
---
Add time beyond that for any other dicking around while leveling.
---
6595 exactly :o
---
BG wait times were different for each server depending on faction balance. Servers with a large imbalance will have long queue times for the larger population. IE if your server is 2:1 in favor of Horde then Horde will have a longer wait. There are just as many servers where the population is tipped in favor of Alliance though. There is no way to know ahead of time.
---
If that just isn't the sad truth... I liked pally tanking in Bc and wotlk. Sucks they aren't efficient in vanilla. If it wasn't for they are terrible at tanking id roll one myself in classic.
---
I leveled holy pally in 2006 all the way till wrath, felt like a third wheel in classic but came into my own in TBC
---
I wish I could be a weeb neet and play wow full time damn
---
What the hell? I'm not playing this shit then
---
Of course you can, easily. Roll mage, grind 50-150g an hour depending on patch solo. 100-200g will *easily* buy the 300 tailoring you want for Robe of the Archmage, or 225 Blacksmithing trinket.
---
I wouldn't know about retail, I don't play it.
---
Meh, you had me until you mentioned your willingness to play with Europeans.
---
I stopped playing pservers the day I saw the Classic announcement, but it hasn't been easy staying away.
---
Enjoy the boat ride. It’s an epic run but it’s fun.
---
I sure hope not! My great great great great great great grand papi was a slave in Egypt... This would HIGHLY OFFEND ME!!!
---
no, you’re absolutely right. I hate the 5-7 days of game time I spend leveling, it’s an absolute chore—id rather work my job. I must be such a masochist doing things I hate like leveling multiple classes to 60 (6-8 now) between classic, prenerf bc, and pservers. 
---
Ignorant statement of the day goes to....you! I like leveling. I like it a lot, that’s why my list of zone preference is weighted towards the utility the zone has for leveling. By the way, barrens offers quests for horde and duskwood for alliance, it isnt as though I can skip duskwood and go level in barrens. And if I am human, dwarf or gnome, it’s unreasonable to NOT level in duskwood.
---
I dont doubt it
---
Gelkis. I just find that navigating the magram area is much easier and more spacious than that pit the gelkis live in.
---
Or just set yourself as "At War" with whoever you pick and continue to pickpocket ez
---
It's called the Wetlands Run.
---
For reference;
---
https://youtu.be/Jz8j-M3UuGw
---
This is really Impressive And it is Funny
---
Im laughing at you even more now thinking 100-300 gold will get you 300 tailoring or 300 of anything.
---
Indeed. I have Ironfoe myself. Did exactly this. Should actually be easier to farm as a Pala because every pack in BRD on an emperor run is just a massive aoe pull. Warriors struggle to deal with that until later gear levels.
---
The general consensus seems to be that they will have cross realm battlegroups to even out queue times for imbalanced and low pop realms - because that's how the game was in 1.12.    
---
    
---
If that's the case and the overall faction balance is ok you can expect queue times of 1-5 mins for both factions.   
---
If they don't have CR-Bgs then unless they have some magic solution for faction and population imbalance it's going to mean wildly different experiences for battlegrounds, pvp ranking, and queue times between the realms. In that situation if you're a serious pvp'er you'll probably have to wait a week or so to make sure you land on a popular and active realm.
---
The record for speed leveling during actual Vanilla was something like 4 days and 20 hours of played time. I think 8 days played was average for most people who like to do a few dungeons but were being semi-mindful about not wasting too much time.
---
OK, what would I know :)
---
Battlegrounds are Phase 3. Honor System and rewards is Phase 2. There will be an unknown period of time where the only way to obtain BiS gear for the next year+ is to world pvp. Level 48s give honor. The big zeros will likely be meeting more often in the Plaguelands and UnGoro this time around since they offer incidental honor bonus in sub 60s. 
---
Side note I still think Hillsbrad wars will be a thing.
---
Magram sounds cooler to me so Gelkis always die.
---
They still won't be able to promise longevity and security though.
---
Also, they will likely be highly unmoderated.
---
Lol dude so damn angry calm down. Duskwood is a better zone but Barrens has quests you can finish faster so you can feel better about yourself if you go there and get those sweet levels a whole day earlier than others. Woo.
---
Dont run through Wetlands. Die in the sea off menethil and rez in coldridge valley. Follow this guide to the 20 minute mark. It will take you straight to your brothers. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yMpJK-4fLFE
---
Well put.  To this day, when forming a group, I'll take a well-skilled and knowledgeable player who knows defense as well as offense to go into dungeons and hopefully, into raids.  I can't tell you how many times a well-timed nova or silence saved the group, how a sheep allowed us to bandage as the healer got mana, and how many times a hunter would continually trap one NPC so we could get through with the fight.   While I love damage, it's got to be timed right, and you have to have a skillful tank to hold that aggro that a fire mage can create.  And if I do get aggro?  I damn well better know some kind of a defense.
---
And I'm going back to the days when a sheeped mob regained health!  It was easier to regen mana and health via bandages and let the mob return to full health, than it was to risk someone dying and another repop happening.  Again, I played when the dungeons were full of npc's, and you had to pull, kill, move up, pull, kill, move up and continually move forward or the repops would getcha!
---
Some fun was had down in BRD, and in Undead Strath and Scholo learning our 'advanced' class techniques!  But it was fun, damn fun -- and it felt good to know that as a team, you could kill anything, expect more, and continue on.
---
The current record is 116 hours, done by the person who wrote the guide you are referring to. I wonder then how someone who is casually following this guide would be capable of beating the record by 26 hours.

Yeah man the private server crowd was atrocious to say the least. I know OP is trying to be polite by dancing around that point, but I can say I honestly loathed the free-server culture.
---
Nerds are gonna run Classic WoW not Chads :\\
---
Amen
---
Then you either should immediately start changing ur mind instead of telling urself something that isn' true or live with the fact that someone else might tank as paladin while u always wanted to be the one that does that.
---
Feel free to ask me anything about Prot Pally, i played one myself on private servers and van give u a lot of insight if u need.
---
Thanks Anal_Torpedoes!
---
How it fucks up the economy is simple, the less people are farming, the less that is on the market to sell. A vibrant and full economy is a good thing, regardless of the price.  
---
Considering how much they hate my comment about dual spec, you would be lucky if they are fine with any changes.
---
I do not disagree with you on this point, I just didn't find any easy way to account for that. I could have doubled the polls so that each class had a "main" and "alt" I suppose.  But that is why I was trying to take into account lvl 35 profession alts as well.   In the FAAAAAAAR future I plan to have every class at lvl 60 someday, so it is only a matter of time. If this is case with many players these polls will still wind up working. I plan to play the game for a long time.
---
Horde has its perks, primary one being their city locations and what that means for Mage portals. 
---
But when it comes to groups of players meeting up and trying to turn each other into Honorable Kills? Alliance just shits on Horde. People will argue, and say that there are benefits to Shaman over Paladin, and that AQ gear brings a new dimension to it, and they aren't wrong. But the Alliance group still has a significant advantage. 
---
Think about how trainable a Shaman is, versus a Paladin. Think about what a Horde group does when its Priest is walking around as a sheep and half of them are now sitting in a Frost Nova. And the Shaman is jumping up and down spamming instants until he dies because that's all he can do with even a single good melee on him, much less a few training.
---
The bubble. The dispels. The infinite quick heals. The plate. The buffs. 
---
Versus your entire class being eliminated by a Warlock with a totem stomp macro and his felpup. I'm not sober right now so kinda rambling but I'm telling you Alliance &gt; Horde
---
Even if we're EU based, &lt;CREW&gt; could be you crew :D
---
There used to be a saying in games when someone absolutely destroyed you. You would say “wow that person just raped me” and no one would bat an eye. No one cared even if you said “lol I just raped you”. Nowadays you will get banned for saying that.
---
&gt;I **think** the way I would **think** about doing is **thinking**
---
I think you're overthinking the thinking part here :D
---
The Rank 13 gear will be BiS until Nax, which gets released in Phase, what 5 or 6? While this gear will be available in Phase 2?
---
This just got me thinking - anyone have a list of all the factions/reps there are in Classic?
---
It is worth noting that while I understand the economy issue (see my above comment). I was one of those who during tBC, had to change my spec a LOT for my raid. If we were missing anything, I was the go to, to change, as I played a lot of the "Hybrid" roles (something I am not doing on Classic because of this) such as Druid and Pally. You couldn't quite be a true "Hybrid" though, in some of the raids I was doing, as such I had to spend a LOT of gold, and farm a LOT as a result.  
---
Reducing the price would have as many economy issues as dual spec, whereas it would be faster to do (instead of hearthstone, mount to trainer, respec, put in points, get summoned back).  
---
Even with dual spec, I imagine I would still pay a lot for respec, as needed. But as it stands now, I have issues with the idea of raiding, let along playing classes that can do this.  
---
Funny enough, I was thinking of rolling Warlock as my first go through, simply so I don't have to spend an arm, leg, and a few odd bits you don't need in raiding, to raid.
---
You cannot really blindly follow any of these "do not buy" lists. All of the lists I have seen are aimed at solo speed-run-style leveling. If you plan on doing any dungeons and you follow these lists then you will be missing spells and abilities that may be beneficial or critical to group play.
---
For example all the Warlock guides I have seen say to only buy books for VW and to skip curses otehr than CoA. You are going to have a rough time in dungeons if you only bought VW books and the only curse you have is CoA.
---
I mean Blizz changing an item's name doesn't change what you're able to say, do, or think. Besides, keeping teenagers from spamming cheap jokes in trade chat isn't exactly going to tear apart society.
---
Damn, you’re just a baby.
---
Definitely agree, especially with #1 and #2.
---
Retail vanilla was a really different thing than either current retail, or private servers. Servers only had a few raiding guilds and PvP premades on each side, and everyone knew everyone. You couldn't rename your character or transfer servers, and it took a long time to get to 60 so it wasn't a simple thing to just reroll either. So you were really tied to your identity in a way that just doesn't exist in any form of WoW that's out there now. That meant that stuff like ninja looting, AFK in battlegrounds, etc. tended to fix itself to a certain extent, especially on low-pop servers.
---
That choice is obvious. Any answer other than Magram is simply wrong.
---
I love Westfall and Duskwood too much to roll horde
---
But they are the Chads ingame!
---
While I agree with what you're saying u/frostadamuz isn't really that type of dude.
---
It later game warrior dps is incredible. In dungeons they do ok, since warrior is very gear dependant. But there tanks have an upper hand and "can" res. some items, even dps gear and if you dont agree with it, then you are out of luck.
---
But in later game they are top. A few days ago i saw a video about doing naxx speedrun around 2hrs on PS, and they stacked 13-14 warriors.. thats how op they are.
---
I remember doing this run, it takes a little while, 30mins or so, if I remember it’s free aswel because you don’t need to use the Gryphons or Hippogryphs to get there, but using boats, however it’s a long treck😂
---
Yeah me too
---
Sorry maybe I didnt formulate it greatly I totally agree with you on the fact that these guides dont consider things like pve group content or pvp and thats why I want to make this list to find spells that have literally no to very very nieche uses in all sorts of styles of play
---
\*So kinda extending beyond guides
---
I mean you can tell yourself what you want, they aren't efficient. And it is VERY true about pally tanks in vanilla. Paladins weren't that great at tanking nor dpsing until wotlk. There were some good dps ret pallies in bc but you had to have really good gear.
---
The reason for vanilla wow coming back at all is a ‘necessary evil’ guys, the hottest of takes
---
my prom date died from anorexia
---
This guy gets it. No sense debating with people who claim they have the “ right side of the law” their too blind to see any other perspectives. 
---
Better of arguing with a wall
---
DAD GAMERS OMEGALUL
---
I will be playing at least 7 hours a day. Thats low balling it.
---
If you want to quickly gear up in preparation of raiding, you should tank 5/10mans and reserve dps gear. Tanks shortages are common so you won't have much trouble. Once you're in most/all pre-BiS you can just DPS for a raiding guild.
---
Black people were listens to when they for decades told white people they didn’t appreciate n-word jokes? I mean grow a pair, it’s just gamer words, am I right??
---
Im 24 and honestly I cant wait to play with some older players. Games I play now like Rainbow six and stuff is full of these younger "troll" mentality players. I hope when I get into a guild its majority 25+ with a more mature outlook on the game. Not even raiding hardcore or anything but just more normal conversations than some of the people I play games with now.
---
I agree that his videos are much higher quality than average. His videos are not puffed up with "filler" per-se, but they are perhaps a bit too thorough for my personal taste. Twelve minutes to cover two locations is a bit verbose.
---
I found it helpful to try some class and race combinations on instant lvl60 servers. Feeling how much i like the attack/cast animations.
---
Serious question, is there anything you’d recommend for younger gamers to do now to keep their hands in good shape for the future?
---
Oh no the Shapiro fan club has LOGGED ON guys, this is gonna be epic.
---
Don't care. It's better than cash shop or token.
---
Where are you getting that number? 10k, 5k? They want to enable sharding from the start. It means that there won't be online queues. It would be pretty stupid for them to enable sharding for month and then suddenly enable 5k online limit and put rest of players into queue.
---
What will happen is that they just won't act at all. They will put fixed spawn rate and they will disable sharding after first locations (e.g. after westfall). So players won't be very invested into their characters (20 level is just few days of leveling) and can reroll if they want to play on small or big server at this point, and finally they will form servers as they see fit.
---
Probably in the end there will be one huge alliance and one huge horde server (PvP of course, LoL) and few small servers and everyone will choose the experience they want, either play on small servers or play on mega-servers.
---
Yeah, being overly verbose myself, I enjoy it. I've just accepted that the magical 10 minute mark is a staple of YouTube at this point, and I expect creators who put a lot of time into their work to get paid a bit for their time.
---
It might sound crazy, but i am really glad there is subscription for it. It  works great as a filter. The F2P model games community is pretty different overall and not for the better.
---
The best place to level on Alliance side is Elwynn forest. No matter what race I roll, I send all my toons there after the beginning quests, usually around level 6 😊. The journeys there are fun and immersive 👍🏻👍🏻
---
Shutup, you handsome individual.
---
Remember to set your hearthstone once you get there. You won't be happy when you accidentally hearth back to the NE start location.
---
Hey also planning a lock, but for myself first aid is a MUST while leveling. Getting those bandages will take most of the cloth that's gotten from normal questing, and that makes me reluctant to take tailoring at all.
---
Undercity and the Forsaken race are really cool. They were my beta vanilla experience, so I have fond memories of there.
---
But I like Darnassus, Ironforge, and Stormwind too much to ignore. Gnome warlock or night elf Hunter for me. Maybe I will play Horde later on the side.
---
The real big dick move is to be number 1 on both healing and overhealing.
---
It’s 2019 and the world is full of snowflakes, blizzard simply doesn’t want any backlash.
---
You create a night elf female, strip all gear, and dance on top of a mail box in the capital cities
---
Why not? I played horde shaman, because I'm not going to play horde in Classic, so I won't spoil anything and vanilla is just good game to play. Sure, it's better not to invest into your character that much.
---
You are right. I had just woken up when I wrote this, but to be fair I also tend to qualify my statements too much
---
The name doesn't sound "funny," it sounds "racist." Your confusing the two really speaks to why you made this thread in the first place.
---
U clearly did not play on private Servers. You just remember what vanilla was like back in the days, otherwise u would be convinced that whatever u just said is not true. But maybe u also think that Feral DPS sucks lmao.
---
Since it looks like right-click reporting will be in, the game will be much quieter and censored, that's for sure. God forbid someone have a conflicting opinion in a video game.
---
Do horses have pockets?
---
With my limited knowledge they are without a doubt the best pvp healers for the average player. A very skilled priest healer is probably best, but is much harder to play effectively.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Gelkis_clan
---
&gt; Originally led by Khan Gelk, the Magram situated themselves in the southernmost regions of Desolace when the centaur divided into five tribes and have remained there ever since.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; When the Gelkis clan spoke out against Khan Magra of the Magram clan's notion that strength was essential and the tribe’s survival depended on their fighting spirit, arguing that Theradras always watches over the centaur and will keep the tribes safe and alive, an eternal feud between the two tribes was born.
---
&gt; As such the Gelkis are more civilized — or as close as centaur can come to civilized - than their brethren, with an organised social structure and a firm grasp of the Common tongue. While the Magram only respect strength, the Gelkis respect nature and their birthmother Theradras, calling upon her protection and the power of earth to maintain their existence. Though the Magram view this as weak it would seem to be an erroneous view, as Earth Elementals can be sighted in Gelkis Village, putting an end to unwelcome intruders alongside their centaur masters.
---
Magram sound like they're jerks. Gelkis FTW.
---
That's true, plus who would side with a bunch of pit dwelling centaurs. Good luck reaching top speed or making turns in there. 4 hooved idoits.
---
I joined up, thanks!
---
Making your home next to an encampment of demons proves Gelkis are the tougher tribe.
---
R13 gear is about the same ilvl as T2 (BWL). due to stat weighting, some of the pieces are better than T2 and BiS for some classes.
---
i don't think that's necessarily a problem; there was another recent thread about the purple set and it seems i'm not alone in that opinion.
---
Gnome master race indeed
---
Prepare for the war effort, centaur 60 man raids  are coming
---
people upset over this ought to take a bit of their own advice and get thicker skin over an item being renamed in their video game
---
this is not a hill a purist wants to die on
---
"Like they used to"?
---
Did you even play Vanilla?
---
Overall faction population was something like 70% Alliance and 30% Horde. Most servers, besides perhaps 1 or 2 PvP servers, where heavily Alliance dominated.
---
All 3 servers I played on as Horde would have BG pops in literally less than 1 minute.
---
I suspect that Classic won't have such a huge imbalance, probably something like 55% Alliance to 45% Horde.
---
Alliance will still be the best for PvE progression, and Horde won't have Blood Elves to saturate population and queue times.
---
smoked a lil crack once. can confirm wow more addicting. 😳
---
S+
---
For raiding you should almost never down rank, the only thing you might downrank is Arcane Shot pulling, but even thats not really necessary. Serpent Sting is a waste of a debuff slot so it isnt used and you should never have any problems with mana. The only time i did was in BWL when drakonids had Nature weakness and i had to SS.
---
If youre talking about leveling, still dont downrank, you can regen while you autoshot and your pet does the work.
---
I also waste my time playing arams late at night while waiting for classic. Toss me a friend request. 
---
BenjaminJWilson
---
Not my name, my summoner name is one of my friends names that I play league with, Lmao.
---
first, to clarify, i think you mean spells to *never* buy -- as opposed to spells not to buy while levelling (which is a more common thing to discuss).
---
with that, i disagree with Sense Demons. this is useful for farming demons and detecting enemy warlocks -- there is occasional use. if you don't have any gathering profs, you aren't using minimap pings anyway so may as well have demons.
---
for warlock i propose *Create Firestone*, it's ONLY useful for meme-ing. also, dont buy any pet grimoires other than the max rank unless you need it for levelling. one more: you can skip *Soothing Kiss* entirely.
---
Hunters are ok until AQ40. Always good in PvP. 
---
After that you need max 1 for mark and kiting. That's about it.
---
&gt;if one starts using shit like potions/lay on hands that kinda thing I'll probably just blind them or something to even the odds.
---
I don't understand, how would that make it unfair?  Every one has access to potions, lay on hands uses all of the paladins mana making him just auto attack for a while. 
---
What about engineering items or other classes using their cooldowns?
---
I'm fooling around on a fresh private realm atm and people are friendly as fu**. 
---
Like, the opposite faction just rides past me on a pvp realm. Everyone throws me buffs, even the Warlocks throw around Underwater Breathing. If I ask for directions people help. If I ask for quest assistance people help.
---
If the Classic community ends up toxic I'm actually considering to stay on that private realm tbh.
---
That's a pretty softball way of wording, "I want to be able to say the N-word without explicitly breaking TOS."
---
Businesses are here to make money. The current sociopolitical climate of most first world countries does not support blatant racism, so Blizzard has every incentive to modify an unfortunately named item to avoid any notion that they support it, else they would lose potential customers. This item is only infamous explicitly because people used it in chat in place of the n word.
---
They absolutely have something to be afraid of: loss of revenue. They don't give a fuck otherwise.
---
They are not here to be the bastion of free speech as a concept vs free speech as a first amendment right, because doing so would lose them money.
---
This is a total non-issue for anyone that is capable of not using that word in their everyday vocabulary.
---
Funny though that no matter one which pserver the world chat goes always down the shitter during NA hours.
---
I heard it was $9.99, was that rumor confirmed false?
---
What kind of havoc please enlighten me
---
I'm just waiting for classic BFA
---
The whole game is a non stop grind. I was addicted to this game when I was younger, however I do not believe I’d want to invest that much time in this game again.
---
It’s a sign of both intelligence and insecurity - believe in yourself ❤️
---
Its more the MMO crowd compared to moba/shooter, has imo nothing to do with F2P
---
devilsaur mafias, redridge gank teams, streamer gank teams, Ninja looting community etc...
---
I like your videos, but I would think farming will be most important before you have Pre-BIS or even Pre-100% mount. How much slower can a fresh 60 be approximately farming these spots?
---
If something is worth doing, it's worth doing poorly. Going out of your way to reduce or restrict the avenues for an otherwise anonymous person to be racist over the Internet might not do MUCH, but if it does anything at all, it should be done.
---
This is a very easy thing for Blizzard to do, you're right. But you're not going to end racism in one giant piece of legislation. It happens over time via many small changes. This is one tiny one.
---
Also, what you've suggested to reduce racism and this aren't mutually exclusive things. Let's do both.
---
Horses dont, centaurs... You'd have to ask em.
---
three old lads, they come for blood and sport
---
Indeed. It's also why it's easy to make false deductions about people using given tools. Just because people use it doesn't mean it's good. I'm sure most would gladly take full T3 set if you got offered one after dinging 60 but it would absolutely ruin the game.
---
ikr, lol
---
I cant wait to gank cry babies like u all day
---
Because the old content is far better than anything they have released in years.  I would play/support a BC server.  Will also be playing classic.
---
The real play is not leveling in desolace.
---
Blizzard has said that a BC option wasn't totally off the table, but not currently planned, they're going to monitor how well Classic does, my guess is BC won't happen unless Classic does REALLY well for atleast a couple years.
---
I think it depends on the success of classic and the demand. I'd love for them to open up a BC server in a few years. I'm not really expecting it, but I'd certainly switch to it if they did.
---
Sorry, i meant it for F2P MMOs, not generally.
---
What is classic?
---
You're not a troll, you're just a moron.
---
Comparing me to some right wing nutjob whos still waiting for his balls to drop, won't give you credibility.
---
This may come as a shock for you, but even liberal socialists like me are allowed to think that the SJW - mania that has been gripping our society since the late 80s is idiotic.
---
"My personal opinion is so important that I can't keep it to the other 5 daily threads about this"
---
What would the rotation be then, aimed shot &gt; auto &gt; multi, rinse repeat?
---
And is it going to make anything, anywhere better for anyone?
---
If the answer is "no", and we all know it is, then what's the point?
---
TBC took everyone out of Azeroth, reset the gear to make Azeroth obsolete, introduced a bunch of easymode features, flying mounts, daily quests...
---
I don't get why people want TBC, but are against updates that are much more in line with Classic WoW like additional content that doesn't obsolete current content, small class tweaks to balance poorly performing specs, etc.
---
This is one of the reasons I'm really hoping that they announce servers well in advance.  Assuming they do we should get a fair amount of representation from guilds as to where there rolling and be able to see the landscape some.  Could prove useful when considering bg queue times, then again if they do cross-realm bgs that goes out the window.
---
DAE le BEING GOOD = le NO FUN XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
But what other area uses over 12 different shades of gray? Not stranglethorn I'll tell you that.
---
No but that would have gotten me to get a credit card lol
---
Everything has a prison wallet to pickpocket if you're brave enough.
---
Only like 2 classes actually use t1, for the most part it’s a horrible raiding set for almost every class.
---
Seems just as silly to ignore it altogether as it is to be worried about it, you can have some foresight without making decisions solely based on the future.  Everyone knows the timeline, there are reasons to look ahead when making any immediate decisions.
---
Dude, I'm sorry, but you seem to not understand the point. You're playing private server stuff, not early Vanilla. It's not gonna be that easy, the game is COMPLETELY different early on economically.
---
50-150 gold an hour... Hahaha the best one on a server won't be getting more than 50-70 gold an hour if they are lucky! There's no gold to SPEND that early.
---
A private server with 8000 ppl will make the gold flow alot higher. They have grinded enough mobs in the world... A fresh server doesn't contain one SINGLE copper. Not ONE. So they won't pay you 20 gold for that righteous orb you find, they'll pay you 7-10 if you're lucky. Cus they don't have anymore.
---
This. Once the big streamers and players get into the content these grifters are DOA
---
Even shitty Fortnite doesn't have credit cards. Woah this is amazing.
---
That's just some heavy sample bias. 18-25 year olds make up the majority of this website.
---
I don’t think it’s bad to discuss the idea of BC classic servers. I feel the same about wotlk. The reason I say that is because these were two pieces of great content that currently have no real value in retail. They are leveling zones their raids are ignored unless you want transmog. It can be argued that in their own right those two expansions were as loved as classic. However I do not think they should entertain the idea soon or in the next couple of years.
---
I'm not a kid anymore, what really interested me about classic is the fact that I can take my time and all my progress won't be wiped down because some expansion is releasing and making all past content completely obsolete.
---
I would be ok if they bring it up to the end of LK, but do so at about half the pace they did before.
---
It's included in WoW subscription, so I think in usd is 15.
---
maybe you, maybe someone else can just bare BC and some won't even do BC. Is it worth to split a niche community with every expansion?
---
&gt; might not do MUCH, but if it does anything at all, it should be done.
---
I absolutely agree with you, but here is the problem: This isn't going to do ANYTHING. At all. Not a single person suffering from racism will be better off because of this. No racist will be transformed back into a normal human being because of this.
---
This is just pointless "feel-good" symbolism.
---
STV offers 12 different shades of red, and a hint of green.
---
Classic will be included with the normal retail wow sub. 
---
Pretty much every single rumor during 2018 was false (as they almost always are, but people were starved for news and it made them very gullible).
---
Just have fun
---
The biggest for me is reliability. 
---
K1, 2 and 3 were Ddos’d. There are quests on every pserver that don’t work right. We don’t know armor values of bosses, for example. 
---
I’m reasonably sure it won’t be shut down and I know it will be moderated for quality (banning bots/gold sellers/buyers)
---
It will be nice not seeing people saying the N word and other dumb shit every 5 seconds, that's for sure. ._.
---
People always get upset about the videos hitting the 10:01 mark, but unless they actually insert an additional midroll ad, it doesn't mean anything.
---
Little premature it seems...
---
inb4 people trying to claim it's actually europeans trolling (exclusively during NA hours)
---
Water is wet
---
More at 11!
---
This was just excellent
---
Just because Classic is successful doesn't mean that BC will. Just because you like classic doesn't mean you like BC. And if BC is released the community not only would be splitting it would be getting shaved, because the people who liked classic won't be able to compete in BC with people with BC items.
---
And you could've just downvoted the thread if you think it's pointless.
---
Instead you commented on it, because you too think that your opinion is valuable, and absolutely must be heard.
---
So, pray tell, the difference between you and OP is...what exactly? :D
---
True artists pick one colour and then stick only to the shades within it
---
Because a lot of people consider everything "Classic" up until mid Wotlk and the introduction of dungeon finder. From then on I didn't consider WoW a MMORPG anymore.
---
That said, TBC and Wrath are generally considered the good expansions and I absolutely anticipate a classic release after 2 or 3 years.
---
ninja looting isnt exclusive to pserver in my 3years of playing on such I had 1 case of ninja looting in a dungeon that argueably wasnt even one because everyone has their own idear of ninjalooting I never had it in raids
---
devilsaur mafias wont be a thing because they need 2 things to actually work: 1st crossfaction collusion of hardcore players of both factions that are able to contest the spawn for literally weeks. Wont be a thing on a Blizzard realm because they hopefully down allow this kind of things. 2nd Idiots who are actually dumb enough to buy from those people. Its easy to sell your mafia leather on a pserver because people are competitive enough to say fuck it I pay way too much for this items because the guild I wanna join requires me to have those items or you can just sell them to the chinese who dont give a shit anyways. On a server that has a smaller crowd of people who speak the same language it will be pretty fast very clear what is going on and you can just stop optaining the items from those palyers. The entire mafia thing only worked because there where WAY too many people buying those sets. If people actually knew how easy it is to make this shit stop they wouldnt be so affraid of it. It just wont be a thing in classic.
---
When it comes to ganking I cant get behind how sensitive people are when it comes to this. Its part of the game and if you really thinks its such a big deal then roll PvE
---

---
Maybe, we used to do a lot of world PVP.  Boat wars when we'd take over the menethil boat.  We took over the tram one time.  Took us a while before we figured out we needed raid gear as much as skill.
---
 Auto Shot &gt; Aimed Shot &gt; Auto Shot &gt; Multi-Shot &gt; Auto Shot   
---
Auto shot before aimed shot because you wanna have the auto shot downtime durning the casting of aimed shot, if the fight allows it you can also weave in raptor/mongoosebite/auto attack between the auto shot downtime (this requiress a slow ranged weapon pref 3sec+)
---
you might think this is the dumbest \*\*\*t you ever head and I would agree. Until I heard prominent people from the community just saying this stupid \*\*\*t like alenxsual in his last video.
---
Neither of us know what the community will be asking for 2-3 years from now when classic is finished releasing content. And even then, if we do ask for it, it's not like it'll come out in an instant. I think it is safe to say that regardless of what anyone thinks should happen after naxx, everyone is going to have a whole lot of time with classic.
---
funny fact, almost noone was buying hots stuff after their facepalm lootboxes, rip hots 12/2018
---
Probably end up doing the same thing I did back when I started WoW. Level up few characters to lvl 15-20 and then decide which one will be my main. I'm not going to try to rush it to 60. Also what my friends pick will probably affect my choice. Don't have enough friends to get a full group but it'd still be nice to be able to cover at least tanking and healing.

---
I don’t understand your last sentence. But I do understand where your coming from on the splitting of the community. With that said I think it’s a bit disengenious to think the two games can’t go exsist and satisfy their respective fan base. There will be players that eventually get tired of classic and want the next step if they enjoyed BC. I don’t think the classic community should gatekeep them from voicing their oppinion on what they want because we had that done to us and it was not fun.
---
That’s why we need a glossary. 
---
In my opinion, Vanilla is not classic. But the classic version coming out is “Classic Vanilla”. If they were to do the same with TBC, it would be “Classic TBC.”
---
Maybe if you took 10 seconds to give someone the benefit of the doubt? Or do you lack imagination?
---
The option, imo, is either vanilla only, or classic progression through all pre cata content. As not only is there a cataclysmic lore event that physically changes the world to what it is today, but it also heralds a shift in game design.
---
Further it’s the clear point where WC3 and tft plot threads end. 
---
If blizzard is remaining wc3 memorializing its aftermath makes sense.
---
If blizzard is making wc4, cataclysm and beyond is either where you start the story or where you deviate and say wow is alt universe (thanks time travel).
---
It’s 100% a different game with different material quantities required to level you to 300. It would be like you buying smash brothers ultimate for Nintendo switch, because your trying to get better at smash brothers for GameCube. 
---
All the information is available to you online, subbing to retail and doing it there is not just a waste of money. It also won’t help you at all to path out your route as everyone said above, it’s all been changed years ago.
---
who is a lot of people? classic until mid wotlk?  NANI?????????
---
The only thing you really want to downrank for your DPS rotation is Multishot, and only if you can't help it.
---
It's still less toxic than r/wowservers at least
---
If BC servers were ever made they would be fresh your classic servers would still exsist.
---
That's my main worry about it being retuned to be more difficult too. I'd much rather it be left as is rather than overtuned and now undoable with bringing memespecs. We already have that difficult content in the form of Naxx.
---
As a Paladin you would be wise to go for Ashbringer over Menethil anyway, since Drain Life effects like you find on Ashbringer, Neretzek, Shadowstrike etc scale with 100% of spellpower. The procs can easily deal 1000+ damage with endgame gear.
---
&gt;complaining about splitting the community
---
You do realize that was retail's entire argument about why NOT to have vanilla servers? I've enjoyed vanilla greatly when it came out and I'm eager to see it again, but I'm more excited for TBC. That's just how it is, and complaining that it'll 'split up' the vanilla community is ridiculous in its hypocrisy.
---
You said “BC Classic,” and I think OP thinks that the term “Classic” can’t be applied to the other expansions.
---
If they remade TBC, it would definitely be considered “Classic TBC”, so people can decipher between original and new
---
I'd say the red art in STV is more of a community collaboration.
---
Im sorry but this just isnt true. On retail, you never see The Knicker being linked in global and leading to racists chiming off racial slurs and ideas. Every private server I've played, it happens almost daily. Additionally a new one I've discovered, being able to change the words in the link for Thunderfury. You can't do it on retail, and thus you don't get racists and ignorant people trying to get attention in global by putting in all kinds of offensive (yes, there are things that are offensive and just because I think so doesn't make me a snowflake) things in chat using the changeable thunderfury link like how I CONSTANTLY see on private servers.

---
yeah with half of the people on it.
---
Have you seen retail trade chat? It's not gonna happen lol
---
I disagree. Let's construct a quick hypothetical.
---
A person of color is playing WoW, and they're grouped with some people. One of them has The Nicker and starts making racist jokes using it. It's totally possible that having the item named The Blackrock Slicer instead wouldn't put the connection of nicker/n-word at the front of their mind and prompt them to try to make something they think is funny out of it. The initial player, if they weren't comfortable with racist jokes toward them, wouldn't have to deal with the situation of either confronting the guy making shitty jokes or trying to just ignore it in order to facilitate the rest of the group going smoothly.
---
Again, it's not a huge thing, but it's not like it wouldn't address a potential problem either. The dude who would make the casually racist joke will probably still be racist, but at least in this situation the POC doesn't have to deal with it when they just wanna play their favorite video game.
---
I get people are so against it but if it helps classic then I'm all for it so long as it's 100% cosmetic type stuff like TCG items.  There are plenty of reasons for Blizzard to attempt something to this effect and they don't all have to be money grubbing, that being said as soon as it veers into P2W/gold/etc. then that's a huge red flag.
---

Lol naw never been into the whole feel of druids. It’s gonna be war for me again!

I've been playing with that rotation on a private server a bit, and I still seem to be running short on mana pretty fast. Do you have any other recommendations for a scrub like me?

Discord sign ups makes pugging so easy in modern times
---
That's actually a pretty awesome idea, I love it. I never even considered splitting the raid group up to more efficiently farm and cut down on back tracking.
---
ZG Tiger baby, as Horde of course
---
You got a link for that podcast?
---
So just because the reddit user happens to be a streamer you cant ask him/her questions like with every other person on this website?
---
At this point I’d assume it’s the level 60 set. 
---
That said, they announced pvp developments separate from related pve developments, think phases.
---
So maybe we will see a pvp item progression post, as the reasons for pvp gear updates was different from why items in mc were added in 1.5 or why t2 warrior helm was buffed and beefed and buffed.
---
It’s more in line with why new gear was added in 1.10. If they agree with that premise, there is a good argument for pvp gear to start at lvl 58, for epic gear to be upgraded—I dunno how they make that work (I recall there was a vendor in vanilla for when it happened?)
---
A "faithful recreation" would pretty much be an oxymoron anyway. Some people are fine with changes here or there, and other people seem to want everything the exact same. But the latter group doesn't seem to realize that it's literally impossible to have everything the exact same, because the first time Vanilla happened, Vanilla hadn't happened yet.
---
Itemization is a great example of that. If Blizzard were to recreate Vanilla as faithfully as possible, then the problems we are discussing would happen. People would know which items will be buffed and/or nerfed in upcoming patches, and they will make decisions based on that. So even with a purely-faithful recreation, it won't be the same. And on the flip side, if they don't recreate it that faithfully, then *that* is also not the same. So either way, it's impossible to recreate the same thing.
---
I wish more people realized that Blizzard literally cannot bring back the past. When they make this or that decision on how to do something this time around, it isn't as simple as "Should we bring back Vanilla, or should we change things up for the fun of it?" Often, there is no way to bring back Vanilla in that regard, so they make the best choice they can.
---
He'll need to go back for his level 10 class quests.
---
I’m totally guessing with the 5k number. Ion’s twitter post is alluding to a “thin” realmlist which means more players per server and with sharding that will be possible.
---
indont think classic will stay a niche community. I also don’t think splitting a community is the right term. There will be players in classic that would love a true BC remaster it was their proffered version of wow. Why should any wow player try and gatekeep others from what they would prefer. At the end of the day we all love wow. Some prefer BC some want WoTLK. We shouldn’t j Alan brak them and tell them you think you want that but you don’t based on our personal preference.
---
I mean it is true, people will leave BFA to play classic. The difference is that a lot of people that don't even play BFA will play classic. Would there be a lot of people that won't play classic but will play BC? I doubt it. So, not necessarily the same situation.
---
Not true. PvP gear being retained after rank decays got added in patch 1.6.
---
TBC servers would not make Classic servers go away. So stop crying.
---
&gt; and leading to racists chiming off racial slurs and ideas. 
---
And now let me ask you something:  
---
Do you, honestly, believe that because you took away the opportunity to post this item, someone who has a racist mindest will be less racist than before?
---
My cat was born in captivity. She get's fed daily, as often as she wants. She has no need to hunt. She isn't even good at it.
---
But when she gets a hold of a bird, she will kill and eat it. Things don't change because you slap a happy face on them and pretend all is civil and nice. I may cuddle my cat and post pictured of her, and pretend shes the nicest, cuddliest, furriest creature in the world...but deep down, she's still a predator.
---
They outlined this in the [Classic PVP Content Plan](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049):
---
&gt;That’ll change once phase 2 rolls around and we add the Honor System, which will introduce Honorable Kills, Dishonorable Kills, and PvP Rank Rewards. **The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12.** Keep in mind though, just as it did originally, it will require a substantial time investment to rank up through the Honor System. For those interested in the Rank Rewards, earning epic gear will require consistent dedication over a long period of time as a top contributor on your realm. We don’t expect to see many people running around with these items early on, but we’re certain Hillsbrad Foothills will still see its fair share of action! 
---
It is a bit of a departure from their item release plan more broadly so I think they should have echoed this decision in their more recent post.
---
not me lol go on a date whip that bad boy out and the dates over faster than you can say virgin
---
I'd love to have that game-card looking visa card (the one with the female night elf).
---
Don’t remember which is which, but I chose the one on land instead of the caves. A lot easier to get to the quest giver haha
---
World of Warcraft is in the gaming hall of fame, can fortnite say the same?
---
There won’t be a world chat..
---
I'm not crying, I'm opening a medium for discussion you ape.
---
Unless she plays the same faction as you and she gets impressed and says "the gates are open for you tonight young warrior"
---
Why are you getting downvoted?
---
Mana potions and mana oils?
---
On top of that, one point I forgot to mention is that somebody getting banned for good reason never really happens on private servers. So much pure hateful unveiled racism, for example, that people love to have a space to spew it.
---
Imo picking the role which is highest in demand is the best. Tank and healer. Then later on level a mage/hunter/w.e and they can be your farmer.
---
The private realms will be shut down. Blizz did C&amp;D on the major servers constantly in the past even without a working classic model. Now that they have a working classic model it is in their best interests to C&amp;D every private server.
---
I remember when they were offered, but was way too young to even think about getting one.
---
If I had the opportunity to get one now, I would do it in a heartbeat.
---
definitely not
---
Doesn't every MPQ pack get hashed and sent to Blizzards for comparison during startup? They must have some source of detecting edits like these?
---
That’s kind of why I hope you can’t link professions. Encourages you to talk to the person, and makes the game more social. Then again, I won’t care if they change it.
---
Yes, that's exactly what I said. Nice quote.
---
My bank offers custom prints on debit cards, i could get something like this
---
That’s not what I mean and you damn well know it. You can’t fool yourself.
---
If you want to pvp then Alliance Warlock is not optimal.
---
It’s ok
---
if it were to be classic progression it would have made more sense for them to go with item progression I reckon.
---
imagine playing a human paladin with full t1. guess gates are pretty closed then..
---
I play paladin you dumb slut
---
Who’s to say that’s not inevitable. Honestly I feel like your making mountains out of mole heals and trying to drive a wedge in a community it doesn’t need. If BC classic came out 2-3 years after classic I’d probably just play both if I still had goals left on classic. The games not going to be never ending fullnpopulation. When the long term population declines maybe a year or two after NAXX you will see the population drop. It can be slightly mitigated by hosting fresh realms every couple of years but it will decline. So with that in mind why would it hurt you if they spun up a BC classic realm at this time. It’s not like BC classic comes out and your server will automatically roll over to it. They will be released like classic but as an almost separate game.
---
Or female underpants, if you're a Brit.
---
I hate fortnite but it is definitely in the hall of fame. It was a cultural phenomenon much like WoW was.
---
This kinda stuff is way too “Xbox” for me. we don’t need little awards given out for trivial stuff like falling 500 feet without dying.
---
Bank alt is the first thing I make and I mail him items constantly. Also getting bigger bags early on is a priority for me. They’re not bop so I don’t mind splurging on them.

I mean i can only imagine youre going OOM if the DPS in your guild are really really bad and your fights are all 10+ mins. At worst in long fights in BWL, you should maybe have to use 1 Major Mana Pot on either Nef or Chromag, i prefer using 2 Greater Mana pots for cost efficiency. Not really much in AQ40 to use mana pots on, Emps you cant multishot and C'Thun and Ouro you move around so much you usually regen enough.
---
You can use Oil and Sagefish for more mana regen but i rarely found it useful
---
I’ve been wondering about this for a while. And what about the slavemaker.
---
Pretty sure they extended this so you can just upload any image you want onto a card and have it made. https://i.imgur.com/tkaBaOf.png
---
That would be almost too convenient lol
---
So? They’ll just consolidate servers like EQ does. I don’t understand this obsession people have with “don’t change my classic!” 
---
We’re getting a 2019 version of the game that should be really fun to play. Just like back in 2004 people will play until they’re bored and then maybe come back if TBC or something is ever released. 
---
However, I’d love for them to keep the 60 level cap and just develop new Azeroth content but that’s a pipe dream. By that point many people will be crying for a “no changes!” TBC which is the obvious progression. 
---
So for people who want to stay and those who will want to go we’ll take what we get when the time comes. Why are so many in community so hell bent on getting only what they want? Smile and be happy friend, we’re going back in time :)
---
&gt;Would there be a lot of people that won't play classic but will play BC? I doubt it. 
---
Based on what?
---
It's true that it's likely that the overwhelming majority even of people who want to play TBC servers are likely to try out Classic. **Try out**. There is absolutely no guarantee that they would be any more receptive to the idea of committing full time to vanilla--they are just as likely to be tourists on Classic as people who started playing on any other expansion.
---
In the end, the overwhelming majority of people who want to play vanilla wish to do so either because of nostalgia or because they have enjoyed it on private servers. TBC private servers are very popular, and the overall population was higher during all of TBC (significantly when compared to certain points). All in all, logically there should be much more people who view TBC with nostalgia than vanilla. But of course, many of them also played vanilla.
---
You are absolutely in no position to determine what servers are more likely to be popular, there is almost no data on the subject other than the fact vanilla private servers were more popular than TBC private servers--which is a complicated statistic that is far more complex than just which phase of WoW was more popular. People who started in vanilla are likely to be older than people who started in TBC, ergo among people who work on a private server as a passion project, it is more likely that vanilla administration is older than a TBC administration. Data for vanilla is less complete than TBC, but vanilla systems and raids are much easier to implement than TBC encounters. TBC was released in one enormous bulk--two entire tiers were available from the get go, and the third tier opened just a short while after release in 2.1. There is less structure to a TBC release, and thus the hardcore players are going to burn through 90% of the content in several months, after which they become inactive until SWP, damaging the community's structure.
---
The absolute **only** indication that vanilla is more popular than TBC is private server populations. Which rely on far more than just the inherent popularity of the product.
---
The average player will take longer than 160 hours. 
---
If you’ve played wow, are decent, and have a second monitor with a database up you can probably assume 170-200 hours for your average player. 
---
I play the game a lot, and have for years. I don’t memorize routes, just play. My last warrior took under 8 days, my last mage under 6, my last priest under 7. 
---
Fastest I’ve done is 5 days and 10 hours, that was my mage alt on live before bc released.
---
yes i thought of firestone a few mins after posting the idea of the post is i want to make a video about "spells new classic players can avoid in general"
---
wanna make a video so i will have fun
---
Lol you are way off here bro.
---
mocking blow is quite good for tanking (i know u cant use it in defensive stance) but i think tanks will use it a lot while stance dancing
---
Umm I would play a BC server in a heartbeat. You don't get to decide what happens post naxx. If there's a demand for BC it will come.
---
Only warlock is blessed with infinite mana. Every other caster has to drink for 30-40 seconds constantly.
---
Started the get that feeling.  It's been so long I forgot.  Regardless chat will be cleaned up and I expect there will be much more productive chatting going on.
---
I've just been hitting a target dummy, no raiding or anything. Sorry, should have probably mentioned that heh.
---
For starters, a comment isn't visible to everyone who goes on the subreddit or browses /new
---
Same argument could also be made for your own comment, but I'm sure you knew that already.
---
First one is a bird. That's just your 12 year old brain coming out. Second one is boobs. It's a fertility statue/idol/carving that has been used in many different cultures for thousands of years.
---
The second one is a carving of a naked fat woman so yes you are seeing tits.
---
I want BC servers post naxx. Too bad
---
I don’t mean to say that Private servers are toxUC, necessarily. I think Vanilla encourages people to be good to each other, and none of the reasons I listed negate that. 
---
But also, I still believe that those reasons will help weed out the toxic people that definitely thrive because of those circumstances. Then again, Classic is unique in a way. It’s going to have a flood of people coming directly from BfA, so the playerbase will be ultra diverse. That could either be a good or bad thing in terms of community, but I believe it will be beneficial.
---
Idk, I’d almost plan on ddos attacks for Classic. I remember WoD launch, /shudder
---
Maybe you are using this post to reveal something about yourself. Congratulations.
---
I agree with the [wowhead.com](https://wowhead.com) comment saying that it reminds them of a bust of a pregnant woman with the belly and breasts, because fertility goddesses and statues venerating them were common.  
---
I cannot seem to see the war idol looking phallic, even though once again, phallic stone carvings were indeed also historically a thing.
---
You can roll another character if you're unhappy with your current one. /thread
---
lol, you're way more beneficial to the raid when you can afford to flask, pot and eat for every single raid. And not to mention, if you get rich, you can have the guild use your gold. Instead of you pushing out those extra 20 dps with engineering.
---
Tons of gold is way more worth than min/maxing your own two professions mate.
---
If you can provide all caster with a flask or pots due to you having herb/Alch, then that's a billions times better for progression.
---
Suit your minmaxing self of course!
---
&gt;Wiping on Baron Geddon because half the dispellers are padding their heal meters is no fun.
---
Sounds like you're not a healer, then.
---
The thing you aren't addressing is the definition of the term "Classic" as opposed to referring to "Vanilla", it allows for a very wide context for the discussion.
---
There are elements of TBC that certainly chime with vanilla somewhat, and to some small extent WotLK likewise. But I agree with the gist of your post, and I believe that one thing that makes this phenomenon of bunching these expansions together under "Classic" so common is that they are simply the older/oldest versions of the game of the more "classic" age of WoW, regardless of them objectively having quite huge differences.
---
Personally looking at TBC and WotLK I wouldn't mind seeing them reappear in some shape or form. The issue that then arises is what should they look like, should they be progressed into from then current servers or should they be isolated expansion servers in parallel to vanilla classic? I can promise you there will be the NOCHANGES crowd for both of those as well, and I don't actually desire to see them in the way they once were if I get a say in it.
---
In the end I would like a classic version of WoW that expands wider with the same true world centric RPG heavier model of vanilla, taking in TBC and WotLK into the vanilla mindset completely. With that noting that I simply don't want to see flying mounts at all, nor different dungeon difficulties. I don't want to see the progressive normalisation of classes and items that went on, I don't want to see the easy mode dungeon spam, teleports and LFG of WotLK. I hated what the arena focus did to PvP and resilience solved very little if anything and instead created a world of new issues. If that then means they have to add ground paths to all the flying areas, nerf scaling and adjust gear and dungeons then so be it. But just killing off flying mounts in them would already be a dream come true.
---
I'm assuming you have 5/5 in Efficiency, but no nothing else, in a raid you should have Blessing of kings/wisdom spirit buff, mana totem should have no problem keeping your mana up for the entire fight, unless you're weaving raptor/mongoose that will drain your mana but heavly increase your dps aswell.
---
Nice of people to make use of their [Children-Toys](http://karaokeforall.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Kids-CD-player.jpg) for YouTube Videos.
---
After classic they should do what they should've done in the first place. Release tbc WITHOUT removing classic. Considering most of the gear gets obsolete with tbc, you might aswell release tbc without the characters we made in classic. Or you give players the option to copy their classic characters to the tbc servers, similar to what you can do on a PTR. This way classic would be preserved and people could still experience tbc.
---
Usually they don’t allow copyrighted content
---
No no... has nothing to do with remembering anything or playing on a private server... They are trash tanks. Don't bring other classes into something about pally tanks. And if you have to bring it up, yes they are pretty low tier dps.
---
I was the heal lead. Which why it was extra frustrating. From the in-depth logs I was very aware of the "top" healers who neglected dispels and spammed HoT's on the raid instead of keeping the tanks up. They frequently had the best meters though!
---
Flying mounts are cancer and just like cancer it slowly killed its host, people attribute WoW's death to other things but for me this is it. If classic wow was anything else beyond vanilla, I feel the developers would have mentioned it by now.
---
I havent played since Vanilla and I'm certain my CDs are gone - though I'm guessing they will be erroneous.
---
Do we know what joining will cost in terms of purchasing the base game?  I'm sure there will be a digital download but i'm trying to gauge the pricing.
---
you gotta look at it this way too... young trolls have advanced and grown up... They've...Evolved.
---
Nah "high quality" just means head tracked captions and power user injokes on there
---
If it comes to worst, I guess this is the best solution.
---
I suppose that you are right, as long as they consolidate servers it should be fine.
---
Yes, it's really easy. Lots of the pre raid bis isn't replaced in MC
---
I play on private servers and have no idea what you’re talking about.
---
I'd run for sure if the guy can't even pay for a date without using his credit card, thats a no no.
---
Mine too, but copyrighted material is not allowed. No idea how anal they are about it though.
---
&gt;st this item, someone who has a racist mindest will be less racist than before?  
---
&gt;My cat was born in captivity. She get's fed daily, as often as she wants. She has no need to hunt. She isn't even good at it.  
---
&gt;But when she gets a hold of a bird, she will kill and eat it. Things don't change because you slap a happy face on them and pretend all is civil and nice. I may cuddle my cat and post pictured of her, and pretend shes the nicest, cuddliest, furriest creature in the world...but deep down, she's still a predator. Pretending otherwise just because her name is "Cuddles", would be delusional.
---
Could give a shit if they're less racist, because we can't change that, but I don't want to see it. Ideally all racists would be thrown in a box weighted down with some very heavy weights and sunk in the marianas trench.
---
Congrats on your 1-year chip.
---
Everyone assumes that BC won't come right away, but who knows, everyone literally assumes it and no conversation its taken place. It could come right away after every phase is done.
---
Yes, but they will reject most things with copyrighted images, at least in my experience.
---
Oh man, I totally forgot about the centaur clans in desolace... Always went Gelkis.
---
nsfw?
---
You’ve never seen unveiled racism on private servers? You could log on a popular one, turn on world chat, and find it in no time flat.
---
How they gonna do the launch (like sharding), whats server cap gonna be (therefore your competition for mobs). How many servers there gonna be and how long the queues gonan be. 
---
All these things we don't know yet. all these parameters will drastically affect how much it gonna take to level.
---
With dynamic spawns on private server, if you follow a guide, it takes like 6-7 days played for a normal/average, not best but not retarded (familiar with games) gamer. 
---
6.5x24 = 156 hours
---
156 / 40 = 3.9 weeks
---
So ya count it as a month best case scenario or month and a half an upper cap.
---
plus since you can play 40 hour a week you get some rested xp working on you. compared to ppl that just nolife through it.
---
But you know if they have a bigger server caps and no dynamic spawns, it will be very hard to level in your style.
---
Haaaahahahaha lmfao. I wasnt ready
---
Maybe on rare occasion. Maybe you’re just easily offended?
---
https://itemization.info/news

The talent system was changed for all the classes (well, maybe not shamans according to the post above), and the spells were changed. The overall effect was huge, the single one that affected raiding the most was probably the priest one in patch 1.10. On alliance side, paladin patch 1.9 also made a huge difference, since they got their 15 minute buffs instead of 5 minute buffs, which meant that they could actually do something else than just buffing.
---
true artists don't accept grey as a color :P
---
The reason we can get these blog posts so clearly is because they have a clear goal to complete. They know exactly what Classic should be and what it should not be.
---
Retail tho... not so much. They have no clear vision. 
---
For instance flying mounts they have split the community so hard that everyone is mad. First they gave flying mount. Then they completely took it away. Then they took it away for a long time and gave it after a x.3 achievement was done. Is WoW a game designed for flying mounts these days? They cant even answer that. 
---
Or how about raiding. What is raiding? Well, they just try to please everyone by having 4 different difficulties. If you ask a retail player about their experience killing Gul`dan, everyone will give a completely different answer ranging from completely unmemorable to the most epicly challenging and satisfying fight in the history of raiding.
---
Retail is like a comedian trying to make the whole audience laugh.
---

MS paint really needs a spell check
---
8 days as an average for semi serious players sounds legit today but during vanilla it's got to be way off, can't remember any non hardcore player clocking that kind of time
---
I still remember having a character I'd invested maybe 50 hours on at that point and wishing I'd picked another hairstyle, so I submitted a GM ticket and tried my hardest to create some rational reason why it was in their best interest to fix it. I don't remember the conversation anymore, but the dude had to have been laughing behind the screen.
---
just don't pick a meme spec and you'll be good
---
Most are still going to play on their own regions. It's not like the other Blizzard games where you can just choose and switch the regions. To play in US region you have to buy the US version and sub to that and if you do then you can't play in the EU unless you pay twice.
---
So now your just rampantly speculating on nothing.  Got it time to disengage from this thread your obviously very stuck on what you want you can’t see other peoples points of view or logic.  I tried to have a decent discussion and all you do is keep acting like j Alan brak you think you want BC but you don’t. Quit trying to be a gatekeeper man people want what they want some people would love a BC classic server I don’t see a problem with them wanting that and blizzard eventually providing them a way to play wow the way they want.
---
If this subreddit is any indication, definitely not.
---
Don't go giving anyone any ideas!
---
It's been ages since I played. Does/did the server tell you the approximate Horde/Alliance balance so you can decide where to roll?
---
They are perfectly fine for tanking all 5 man content right from Deadmines to Dire Maul, and it is a spec that allows you to AoE farm for some decent money pretty much straight away at max level once you throw on some plate gear in every slot. I had a blast playing this on private servers, and then went Holy for raiding.
---
If raid tanking is your thing, then unfortunately you will have to roll a warrior (ferals get to Off Tank sometimes).
---
&gt; First one is a bird
---
Oh wow, I always thought it was a fish =/
---
It's free with a regular wow sub
---
was there ever a WoW equivalent of "we like fortnight we like fortnight we like fortnight we like fortnight"
---
They've said nothing about having to purchase the base game afaik. They've always marketed it as a classic "server option".
---
Hi, /u/markbbbm
---
You don't have to buy WoW for Classic. You just make a free "Starter Edition" account and then add a subscription to it. There is no need to pay twice.
---
This happened to me
---
For something like the savage gladiator chain or ban'thok sash would it be a better experience to just remove it from the loot table until a later phase? (all the way until phase 5?)
---
&gt;Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort. Prior to the Ahn’Qiraj unlock, most of the drop rates and locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with exceptions—there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations.  
---
&gt;One example of the many items we’re planning for is: Titanic Leggings, which is a world drop that first appeared in 1.10. We can confirm that it will be controlled by the same content unlock that restricts the other 1.10 loot changes.   
---
&gt;\--[Classic Content Plan](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346)
---
Is there a set of items where re-itemization led to such a significant change in power level that they deserve to be delayed?
---
49 here .. will be watching this thread.👍
---
Number 4 is going to have a pretty big effect. Global servers means that there are no proper "off hours". It's kinda nice in a way that there're always people to play with. Then again no off hours also means that there's a huge effect on the server economy as things are farmed and contested constantly. I personally loved grinding during nights when I would most of the times be left alone and I'm looking forward to that again. Nights also had chill chats in main cities.
---
Probably, and guilds that have players that are new or haven`t played the game in a long time, will probably spend alot more time than the fastest guilds
---
shadowpriest run out of mana too fast in battlegrounds to be useful, they best part they bring is prayer fort and dispell. Fury arms warrior are beast for dps, MC and BWL youre gonna smash the meters if youre good.
---
I never said that I wasn't speculating on nothing. I do think if they come up BC classic servers without touching actual classic servers would be a solution. And it is not about gatekeep BC, I just don't want to see classic be replaced by BC, I don't think its fair and I wouldn't be playing classic if I knew that was going to be the case.
---
How is this nsfw?
---
I had one of these. I think I got a free month of game time or something lol
---
the second image is obviously boner-inducing
---
İt's kinda sad for me to see people happy about it filter people because of price. My countries exchange rate is really bad , so as lots of countries and it is really expensive for us as 15$. Some good players and good people will be filtered as well just because there is no  payment option for their country.
---
It was a bit higher for players who started on Day 1 Vanilla, but Classic is launching with 1.12 itemization and conveniences. For example, the Flight Path to Camp Taurajo was not added until 1.6 during Vanilla but it will be there on day 1 of Classic.
---
how on earth does that follow
---
Daaaang, these are cool. I’d jump on these if I ever had the chance

I would use this today. I want to see who is willing to call me out

I will do all that in the Beta and then write it down to remember it correctely. I also have to write down what Names I want to save. 
---
And I'm kinda worried about the Server-Choice. I don't want to pick the wrong Server that ends up being dead.
---
If wow released today and wasn't considered outdated I think it would be a huge thing. World was as fully integrated into the internet back  then and gaming culture was different.
---
time for me to find out how picky my bank is about fan art lol
---
Classic wow can include all the expansions in their own isolated way. Ie Classic wow, classic wow:BC, classic wow:wotlk. They can be their own seperate thing under the banner of classic wow. I get your fear of well what if they progress my server to BC I don’t like that but I honestly think the chances of that happening are slim to none and I also think the players that would prefer these different flavors of vanilla would prefer their servers to be their own seperate fresh starts to enjoy the game the way they prefer.
---
thanks for the straight up reply, loveshisbuds. it’s much appreciated.
---
Picking a main is easy, just roll Ele Shaman.
---
I had this problem big time on the server that began with the letter "e".
---
The one that began with "k" on the other hand did not have this problem... unfortunately is was less popular and buggier.
---
Can you upload a document with all the items from phase 0-6 somewhere? I'd love to have that.
---
For a months it was hunter, I'm gonna roll an orc hunter, for the last week nope, gonna be an undead mage. We'll see how it is next week.

We get it, you hate women and minorities

I believe it's a mail chest and ring for G and a back piece for M. I saw a post about it and it seems G likes you more cause there willing to propose but M is the boyfriend that gives you a hoodie and I find it cleaning out after college and toss it lol.

"Specs" are a retail thing that started in cata. In Classic your talent tree is much more flexible, you can even tank with zero points in the prot tree.
---
Well I'm ready to go. I also tinkered around two hours for the perfect Tauren style. 
---
The only thing left is a name now. My og name is so original only my character uses it.

But I want a very short name this time around.

I'm stuck at names right now. Go og or pick a new one...
---
I plan to play Feral tank in raids, but I wouldn't think for a second I could get away with not having a healing set.
---
Well, sure, that's why you get it on your alt(s). No need to waste your profession slots on subpar professions on your maind raid character - leave the gathering and non-beneficial professions like alchemy to the alts.
---
&gt;If you want to play your spec and only your spec, retail is a great experience.
---
So is Classic WoW, it plays differently than Retail WoW and I enjoy playing melee DPS but I do not want to tank. I 100% am behind you in your right NOT to invite DPS only Warriors to your groups. In fact, I understand why you don't want to, it's a 100% personal preference and a stance I understand. 
---
But I don't think we should /spit or look down on people who don't want to tank for whatever reason. Not everyone is going to be a min/max raider or look to be the very best they can be. Some will fully enjoy leveling and getting to 60 just as much as you might enjoy raiding and being optimal.
---
&gt; And is it going to make anything, anywhere better for anyone?
---
&gt;If the answer is "no", and we all know it is,
---
Well yeah it actually makes trade chat better because that's one less shitty "joke" that gets spammed every day.
---
PvE warlock alliance wins for salvation

PvP warlock horde wins for WotF or the orc passive
---
Flying mounts was just another symptom to me... The issue I see it was Blizzard essentially placating every grievance we had with the game, whether or not we knew as much as we thought we did about what we really wanted. 
---
Getting around took too long. Flying mounts. Now PvP is weird and the world shrank despite getting bigger. Even social interactions like getting portals was now pretty rare. 
---
Finding groups took too long. Dungeon finder. Now we don't need to advertise for group but no one knows each other. 
---
Finding raid groups was too hard. Raid finder. Same as the above. 
---
And then the social killer to end them all, sharding and the idea of a "server" being its own ecosystem disappearing. 
---
Each one of these was typically met with more enthusiasm than disdain. Little did we know what we were being robbed of. Pretty much every change Blizzard made to make the game more friendly had the adverse reaction of killing the idea of being social in a game that was meant to promote social situations.
---
Flying mounts was literally the stone that got the ball rolling.
---
True, there's always that
---
2 large streamers played Alliance Kelthuzad.

More or less. But people are prone to forgive him -because- he himself got sick I guess. I don't think he was an asshole or deserved to get sick or anything morbid like that. But Reddit really likes the guy and will do pretty much anything to silence anyone who reminds everyone that Total Biscuit went around wishing ASS CANCER on multiple people on twitter and other social media sites even for people who just disagreed with him. Then he himself got rectal cancer and unfortunately passed away due to this.

edit: automod! Now I have to type my response out again, apologies if it seems like I skimped a bit on my response. 
---
I agree with you guys in not inviting those players to your groups, Guilds, or asking them to leave if they refuse to tank/heal when they have the ability. When I played on &lt;insert certain banned word here) pservers as a spriest, I always healed anyways because I understood and accepted that me healing would benefit the group and I'm a big carebear who likes to help people. 
---
And you are technically correct, the best kind of correct that Specs didn't release until Cata, and that talent trees were what we used to have. But c'mon, they still kinda follow the arms fury prot archetype. If someone CAN tank we shouldn't look down on them because they WONT tank. 
---
Ask them to leave the group, don't invite them to parties if they tell you before hand, and never invite them to your guild. Sure. Just don't look down on them because you never know -why- they're acting the way they are. Maybe they're nervous about leading or maybe they are a kid who WANTS to get into and enjoy WoW too.
---
In 1.12.1 all druids have Innervate as a base-line ability so Moonkins have that.
---
Some people will say "play what you want" and I agree. If you want to click one button (starfire) over and over while spamming expensive consumables and doing half the damage other casters do the Moonkin is the spec for you!
---
Umm , it's not the mic, Camstasia seemed to be the problem here (program i recorded with), i didn't config it and uploaded it straight afterward which caused this unexpected sound issue which i was not aware of. 
---
Now it is little late and took me lot time to fix it , bit exhausted.
---
Engineering is best pve profession.

In 1.12.1 Innervate is a base-line ability for all Moonkins.

I will not comment on Moonkin viability because I don't want to lie or get downvotes.

Moonkin do less damage than Mages and Warlocks and their spells cost crazy amounts of Mana. By all means play what you enjoy but you will probably have a hard time finding a group as a Boomy.
---
Which one do you guys prefer? (Maybe was a bad question...)
---
give it 12 Month when everyone is attached to their characters
---
It was my favorite time. It didnt necessarily have the best raid or even class mechanics, but as an immersive world it was definitely the best. Its too bad the world was really replaced and reduced rather than expanded upon in TBC

The guy's name is three different blatant dogwhistles in a row.

when this guy makes a thread concern trolling about item name changes.

Take my upvote. No more boomie discrimination

All we need is Classic, BC, and Wrath.

I totally agree. Especially with #4. So many people with obviously foreign names (to my own) and I try to invite them to group for kill quests we're both on and usually get ignored. You get the occasional "no thx want to solo" but generally people will group if the area is contested.

Some people use their credit cards only and then pay them off right away. Just an FYI

Don't forget The Eye of Divinity &amp; Ancient Petrified Leaf ;)

Back in wrath my guild leader who was like 8 years older than me took me out to get pizza and I asked to suck her big tiddys and she said no the age difference was too much. I was 17 and she was 26. Damn women gotta ruin all the fun.
---
Oh my god, it really feels like that sometimes!
---
my buddy played spriest throughout all of vanilla, had no trouble at all finding a raid slot and getting into pugs. raid leaders need warm bodies more than anything. they arent too particular at all, due to how difficult it is to fill a 40 man raid.

God, I still remember when that surfaced on the old wow forums for the first time. Thought it was goddamn hilarious.
---
Wow classic graphics suck ass in comparison to BfA. Now that being said, I doubt that people are willing to play classic for it's graphics.
---
was that in og classic or just something they did recently?
