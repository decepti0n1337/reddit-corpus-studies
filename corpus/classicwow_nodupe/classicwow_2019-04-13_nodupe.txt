If you had alts, this is a good time to maybe pick one of the classes you kinda liked and try giving one a full level. I'll probably go priest or rogue depending on which there is less of, but either way I'll be able to find groups because I like to make friends and I'm a try hard
---
---
---
That’s what ignore is for :)
---
For me it was "they're only chasing safety" by underoath while running through the NE Forest and searching thottbot for quest comments.
---

---
What a crazy time it was back in 2004. Using CDs.. plus Spotify didn't come out til 2006 :P
---
“Why are you booing me? I’m right!”
---
LOL, no.
---
I liked the undead mage you fought at the end of that wing, his voice was so cool.
---
"No rest for the angry dead."
---
Leveling weapon skills
---
Gnomish SatNav at its finest
---
Black Rock Mountain is going to be an open world arena.
---
Its kind of a wash between those two.  Depends if you have +sword or +axe mostly.  Some argue that Axe Spec &gt; Sword Spec, some argue the other way.
---
IMO Mace Spec is the best for PVP, but maces are kind of rare.
---
Pfft your purpose is to lie, cheat and steal your way until you get t3 then you raid. Only raid, all day.
---
Why the next two weeks?
---
There's about 4 hours of arguing about Trump on trade every single night on my server. I have at least half the people on ignore, and it still comes in
---
Then you my good sir, is better than most of us!  
---
I'm happy if i even make it to 60 lol.. See you in Azeroth!
---
if you cant get BRE for PVP, then you take what you get, haha.
---
I'm glad Kevin has been so receptive to podcasts.  He's been a great source of trivia and hype for Classic.
---
Private servers have small populations, most of which understand the game like the back of their hand while classic retail will have plenty of naive noobs ripe for roflstomping with meme builds.
---
I have had easier times in 1v1 situations against warlocks than a mage
---
bottom left action bar only. no need for others. keybinding and all other settings can be configured beforehand
---
You can’t overwrite a higher rank, but an untalented/ low +healing spell can overwrite the stronger one because the game prioritizes duration over strength.
---
That’s why your most geared Druid is the one who goes deep resto.
---
As a warrior?
---
Thats just classic tho, many classes stuck with their best most viable spec for endgame.
---
  
---
I like shaman because the leveling is amazing in classic and even at max level you are a highly well rounded class.
---
Also very underrated in PVP, you will still need you majn healers but the utility is crazy in classic.
---
Yes
---
That is next to no explanation and grossly over exaggerated for the most part.
---
I love how you can go from Auberdine to Gadgetzan without running into a single loading screen.
---
I want one of those.
---
ur in for a fucken ride m8 . no need to prepare, just load that bitch up with three lines of coke once servers hit
---
Did you ever feel like you could take on a mage? Sorry honestly trying to make my main you know lol
---
Have you played on any recent pserver?
---
And those people will never have the satisfaction of cleaving a max level party with your epic High warlord sword to 10%hp in one crit
---
I plan on making at least 1 myself.
---
I love Illegal Danish. If only they did their last episode.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also when I was 13, I was like in regards to the title "why are the Danish illegal?".
---
Couple follow up questions. For horde, you’d recommend a Wind Serpent from ~20-60? The ones in the Barrens are like level 21-22. I heard the advantage of owls was their AoE taunt, meaning you could fight multiple targets. 
---
This feels like a really basic question. You have to learn every rank of every pet skill if you want your pet to learn it, right? I leveled a hunter 1-60 on a private server, but I believe you didn’t have to do it on that server. So, like if I’m leveling a cat, I want to stable my pet, and learn each rank of bite and claw? Or do I go back and do it later?
---
Thanks for this, helped a ton actually! I’m still kind of on the fence about it but I got some time to decide since it’s coming soon(tm) anyway.
---
I’m very glad I could be of assistance :)
---
Alex was making all kinds of gains...... Alll kiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnndddddsssss.....
---
The only thing that comes close is warlock summoning, but it's still not exactly what's described in the article, which states you'd need different spellcasters, when in reality you just need a warlock and two other people.
---
You've got a lot to learn
---
Run to Enemy starting zone and start level 1 Dueling fight club
---
It depends if the beta client keeps all my settings and macros or not.
---
Well Soul-Link is a good specc for 1v1, but its not viable for PVE at all, and it starts beeing strong in pvp with BWL-T2. As to beeing kited as a warrior, watch MonkeyNews that warrior is a real example of kiteing skill, a warrior who kites mages and hunters.  
---
So it comes down to skill, but yes Engineering and Free Action Potion and all all consumables for that matter is a must for pvp, on all classes. Or you will be at a disadvantage.  
---
And who gets the opener also matters in wpvp, warlock getting opener on warrior, favors the warlock. Since you get dots up, he charges and you coil his charge. Then what now ? And ofc the otherway around. Warrior gets charge on you, immunes your fear, fear your void. now you cant sac-sheild or have to coil without damage to get him off you.
---
Holy fuck lol... I lost access to my first account ages ago, but there it is... http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/9515003 ... and all the old members of that guild too http://www.warcraftrealms.com/guildexes/174693 bringing back some memories :P
---
Yeah if I got the jump on the mage I was somewhat confident but if it was the other way around I was discouraged
---
Thanks, was wondering where to go for the Alliance side. Cos the classic.db ain't showing anything but the Orgrimmar one.
---
I didn't follow games to much back then being younger but I had just started getting into MMOs with daoc and ffxi. I think it was when I bought wc3, the CD came with an insert that listed blizzard games and it talked about wow coming soon. I kinda flipped out. My friends weren't really gamers so it was just me and my brother getting excited and setting up a gaming center. The hype was low key until I went to the midnight release at game stop and that's when I knew this was going to be big. 
---
Got to play a total of like 4 hours for the next week since the servers kept crashing and then they took the one I wanted to be on down completely for 4 days. That was a rough week.
---
.....reminder to self: turn off 'that item isn't ready yet' shit tonight.
---
It's even worse right now since something triggers it when I fucking log into the game.  Every damn time.  Augh.
---
As already said movement impairing effect is a completely different class of mechanic to stun.
---
I might make an alt I'm not going to play just to be a dick and steal 'shamwow' from some poor horde bastard
---
Did you do some research this time Josh? or are you just going to wing it?
---
Warriors will always be the scissors to a good frost mages rock.
---
If you pop a FAP, a decent mage in a 1v1 scenario will just sheep you and CC you until it wears off.
---
You could still put up a fighting chance as the 30 second immunity is quite long, but in reality your weakness as a warrior will always be a good kiting class.
---
Fuck that, shotgun it!
---
Same. And I still wanna do powerlifting. I have no idea how I will squeeze wow in.
---
Wolf’s howl boosts melee DPs for his group.
---
On which topic? Sometimes I do my homework, others I don’t (clearly!) Time is short sadly!
---
LET ME IN!
---
while i think SFK is one of the coolest dungeons with the best atmosphere, i dont think its that hard like sunken temple for example.
---
I’ve already come to the conclusion that it’s going to be casual fun. I killed myself in my teenage years and that’s not happening again.
---
I’ve already told my friends I will not be present for 50% of the raids and I expect to be handed trash gear.
---
The correct answer is move immediately to your first quest giver and start your grind.  You can adjust your toolbars while auto running to various parts of the starting area.
---
Also, cmon, quit playing with sound.
---
Well, I believe there is others.
---
 than just paladins on ally side :P
---
Trash guilds kite on Razorgore. If your DPS is not able to kill the adds in a timely manner, find a new guild.
---
You will be expected to control the adds anyway tho. You're still gonna be slowing and intentionally taking aggro to make it easier on the tank when too many mobs spawn. Distracting shot is quite useful.
---
How difficult is it to craft if I can find a guild that would let me ret prio it? On pservers rn I’m seeing over 10k gold for just the sulfuras hammer..
---
I misinterpreted your first reply, sorry!
---
That is exactly how I remember it.   To the point where we would test after gear upgrades, to see whom had the strongest rejuvenation, and that person would keep rejuvenation up on the tank.
---
At least in my guilds.
---
Kiting is a pretty normal strat especially early. Of course when your guild gets geared to fuck you can melt adds more easily but almost every hunter that’s raiding seriously will kite on razorgore at some point
---
You can swiftmend his rejuvenation off and toss yours in lol
---
Which vault? Warcraftmovies seems unreliable, and I don't know of anything else. Well, YT apparently seems to be reliable, as this vid has been up since 2006. The only other route I can think of is downloading it and sharing it P2P.
---
Lol
---
Unfortunately, even on PVE servers, you have to go to contested territories to level. So you're not free from the beatings. :D 
---
I've had my fair share of high level characters, especially Rogues (I'm usually a Cloth wearer) rolling up on me and rocking my world while I'm beating on tigers or whatever. As I'm sure we all have.
---
No one likes being ganked.
---
Glad that my repost helped
---
They are quite powerful, especially early on in the game with a good pet. If you spec right you can get deterance and scatter shot which will give you good CC options. Viper Sting is a menace against healers/casters and they'll have to waste most of their GCDs dispelling it or they will go oom quick. Hunters need to have a keen awareness of their positioning because their weakness is their deadzone, you either want to be in melee range or shooting range but never in between.
---
You can never catch the dragon (you might think you did, you might even cut its head off and hang it over the gates, but somehow it's back in its lair talking shit next week waiting for you to chase it).
---
They made 1 major change, exp gains in pop. That killed twinking.
---
This was done way after vanilla tho
---
Drizzt is a character from the Forgotten Realms books that are written by R.A. Salvatore. He’s a Drow Elf Ranger, who unlike 99.99% of Drow knows right from wrong. Drow society is ruled by women, so during his early years, he’s constantly abused and put down by the bigger stronger women, so he leaves his home, the Underdark, to go to the surface where nobody trusts him (because Drow are entirely evil). Drizzt joins a band of adventurers where he uses his pair of scimitars and pet panther to help defeat many evil creatures, and word eventually spreads that he’s *that* Drow. He becomes famous across the Sword Coast, then all of Faerun, and he no longer has to worry about City Guards trying to kill him on sight. 
---
From a character perspective, he’s a “Mary Sue”, meaning a character that’s designed to be more special than everyone else, and in pen and paper RPGs, that usually means the player wants special treatment. But, he’s a badass “misunderstood loner” and that speaks to a lot of people, so he’s often emulated in RPGs. Also if you read the 5th edition DMG, his swords are in there.
---
Armor has an effect on all melee attacks
---
Ted Nugent has trash DPS because he uses a gun.
---
...what? I know we downvote in this sub just cuz but come the fuck on. Every Horde character needing to kill Zhevras at level 14 doesn't slow things down?
---
Hunter’s always shoot incoming target making it impossible to LoS pull.
---
Blizzard Library.
---
I'm going to be interested to see if these preconceptions are going to be a thing come Classic. Most people are basing their ideas of DPS on Pserver numbers which we know are most likely inaccurate. We have some idea of DPS from Vanilla because of footage, but people played completely differently back then, I doubt more than 1% of Hunters knew their actual optimal rotation. Hunters from Vanilla to Wrath were one of the highest skill cap classes because their rotation was so varied. I have a feeling if played optimally Hunters will do high DPS in Vanilla.
---
One does not simply level up alt during phase 2.
---
Ahh yes I was mostly talking about late game. Where mages are decked to shit and so are warlocks. Honestly same goes for warriors and rogues too. It’s just hunters are bad at scaling for dps in raids so I was wondering if a Naxx feared hunter can still be strong in PvP
---
You can heal dungeons and raids but in the latter check with rl
---
Can't wait to roll PvE server
---
The only one I remember is the serpent ward one by the river. I remember it because it was the same totem Vol'jin uses in WC3; I thought it looked really cool in WoW.
---
I love when video games look like video games, if that makes sense.
---
I still think the Super Nintendo is the greatest console ever made &amp; the graphics on those games all still look great to me. Nowadays, some games are trying to have that retro look, some with great success like Stardew Valley.
---
I dislike how some video games have tried to take a turn to more realism, especially in like modern era first-person shooter games. Even in the commercials they hammer home the GRAPHICS as a big selling point, never mentioning the gameplay &amp; half the time just showing cutscenes.
---
Maybe I'm just old, or weird... but a big part of the appeal to me in World of Warcraft, back when it launched, was that - although colorful - it still felt like a video game.
---
When there's a ton of high res textures &amp; whatnot, like in many modern video games, it actually makes it really hard for me to see. Like, I can't play a Call of Duty game. There's just too much going on.
---
I think his point is moreso that vanilla let you decide how you wanted to spend your time doing critical tasks whereas modern WoW is more prescriptive.
---
Yep, Hunters are useful in premade PvP throughout the entire game due to their CC, Viper Sting, Flare, and Hunters Mark on Rogues.
---
where's Pandaria dude?
---
Around level 20 for the Alliance, towards Redridge is the most natural linkup between races imo
---
I like your plan to split tasks!
---
He doesn't need to - dynamic respawn is a factor on most pservers that you need to allow for when testing your classic routes
---
AS A HORDE I AM CONFUSE
---
I would run your shit foh
---
Ca me he re for th is
---
No. You kill the adds from day 1, or concede your guild to mediocrity. Failing to kill the adds is not an acceptable failure on part of the DPS. They will kill the adds.
---
It's about setting clear expectations. Slacking and incompetence will not be tolerated. And if your DPS can't kill the adds, it is slacking and/or incompetence. You don't need BWL gear to do it. The months we get in MC and Onyxia will be plenty.
---
Nice! What about raw damage? Can they still blow up clothes with an aimed shot crit? Maybe even a rogue ?
---
You can burst kill mages in a few seconds late game. 2k+ aim shot into 1500 multishot with 1k+ white crits
---
Actually if BRE is 1.12 itemized (you get a buff ignoring enemy armor instead of putting a debuff on your enemy) you want BRE over Ashkandi. Some of the absolute best pvp warriors in vanilla right now prefer the 1.12.1 BRE over asscandy for PvP. BRE is also better in PvE. Getting 2 or 3 proccs up will shred other warriors like they were in leather and clothies.. well, yeah they're gonna die too.
---
Nerubian Slavemaker doesn’t fuck around around then, huh?
---
Brah you're gonna have widescreen support jesus, go look at the Demo.
---
There are plenty of options for leveling. Generally people will pick a high dps pet and one that will have access to plenty of focus dump spells. Owls, Cats, Raptors and Wolves are what you'll see most Hunters level with.
---
I have a soft spot for Boars since I love their Charge mechanic. It feels great to have your pet able to rush in to combat straight away instead of having to wander in.
---
I hope your blacklist is as bottomless as my mug of ale.
---
Seeing as Im not screaming into the void, I'll try to be constructive: 
---
1. If you do a podcast on content that is still in the game, do a tour with someone who was there at Vanilla. I listened to the AQ stuff, some of which was good. At times, it was obvious that you, personally, had no idea.
---
2. A topic that you have brushed against a few times that might be worth expanding on: Player Fame and reputation. With no server transfers, you get to know who the top guilds are on your server and you would occasionally see players from those guilds around ironforge (or equivalent). They looked so cool. Their gear was amazing. You could see people just camped out in front of them staring and inspecting. Grand Marshals (HWL) were around. Some of them were assholes, obviously, but not all. It wasn't unheard of to be in a 5 man or a 20 man with these guys and you could see first hand just how good they were.
---
 I imagine these phenomena were more pronounced in PVP. It would include the opposition.
---
 People would look after their reputation. Ninja looters were known and reviled.
---
 Eventually all this went away and almost all people you saw around were strangers. That guy you did a 5 man with levelling up, you may see again but you never bothered to remember him in the first place. Back in the day, you were much more likely to remember and respect people.
---
I'm out of time.
---
Warriors are the worst solo world pvpers in the game.  Add a healer, however....
---
Pre 60 dungeons? Yeah you can
---
That’s when i knew we all grew up is when even the MMOs were inescapable from politics. 
---
I fucking hate politics
---
I skipped all  tier 2 on my hunter and only went with Giantstalker (tier 1). The multishot bonus is awesome for pvp too. I out dps-ed tier 2 hunters in raids...not sure how much more I wouldve done in tier 2. What i'm saying is that tier 2 isn't really necessary -- my hunter was great in PvP.
---
Is it possible... to... purge pally bubbles ?!
---
Waste of a prime ++ keybind feelsbadman.
---
I totally appreciate where you’re coming from - I say on the show a bit that I didn’t raid. Ever. So my ignorance will 100% shine through on some content we discuss, I definitely do research before this chats but nothing that will ever replace experience, so I’m sorry that my lack of knowledge my run some people the wrong way, I totally understand what is a highly valid note about the show. I’ll see what I can do in the future re: point #2. 
---
Thanks so much for the feedback, I really do appreciate it!
---
Wtf i love priest now
---
Basically in the same position as OP except I've always been Alliance. I always fancied myself an UD Priest or at a push a Tauren Shaman. Thing is I just feel like the Horde is so half assed. Trolls and Orcs are butt ugly, aesthetics matter to me. Taurens make for badass warriors and stewards of nature but despite the lore they make more sense as an Alliance race imo, with their personalities and affinity to nature. I think they did a real nice job with Undead, their models are great, armour sets look good, lore makes sense. 
---
Alliance is easy, humans are.. well us. Dwarves and elves have been written about in various fantasy literature for centuries. (As have Orcs but not the gimped goofy version here, I was hoping for real mean nasty SoB's when I first started). Alliance cities are incredible and are bastions of strength to each race (Fuck noams), Orgrimmar is shitty, plain and ugly. Mulgore is actually cool as hell but kinda awkward to get around. Undercity.. where?
---
Horde are a rag-tag bunch of ugly looking bad dudes, whereas Alliance are all the normal races you wanna play in a fantasy game. 
---
I too have tried to start alts on Horde, Mulgore is cool, Tirisfal glades is ok, but the Orc place? God it's so shitty and boring to look at and roam around.. then the famous Barrens.. more desert. That's as far as I get. With Alliance you get glorious forests, lakes, snowy mountains, the home of the elves.. it's so much better thought out. I feel like WoW was all about Alliance then someone said 2 days before release "Hey we need someone for these guys to fight".. Tada.. Horde was born and hastily written into the lore.
---
80-120g for orbs is the inflated Pserver price where the population is 5-10k depending on the time of day which means way more people farming vendor loot and inflating the economy. They're not going to be that expensive on classic with server pops of 2-4k active assuming they go with the regular server size from vanilla.
---
Well, to all of you who wanted the classic wow experience, here it is.  Long delays and no known deadline while they make sure everything is done right was a part of the old school Blizzard production.
---
In all seriousness, wouldn't you rather it was done right than quickly?
---
Ugh, who moved??? RIGHT CLICK AND STAY STILL
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༼つ SUMMON THE RELEASE DATE ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༼つ
---
Why would they do that and not hold it until 8.2 has aged a bit and people are screaming for something new. It's not like they have never backpedalled on a release... season.
---
I say October.
---
It was the episode “make love not Warcraft” that peaked my interest and I got the game the next day.
---
I was in the best premade on nost, at the time. We set the brackets, and would typically be done farming by Friday, or Saturday morning. 3-4 days of the week we only had to keep tabs on other rankers to see if they were attempting to bust a bracket. My final week required a bit over a million honor iirc, because a Chinese player was attempting to take a br1 slot even though we were giving him a br2 slot. So we just went high enough no one else ranking at the time could compete with, but other than that it was smooth sailing. Everyone respected the brackets and it made everyone's lives easier.
---
"Sounds pretty bfa to me"
---
New classic slang
---
Mining and engineering imo
---
I'm really curious how building Classic off the modern engine is going to affect pathing in dungeons. Soloing Scholo for fun &amp; DM West for gold was a ton of fun for Warlocks, but was entirely dependant on some pathing interactions.
---
Well nowadays people more often than not know how to properly kite people, but it still is fun to be honest. 
---
Had a blast on nost running into allies while farming stuff - just don't let em see you first!
---
Why would you have an alternative character.
---
The private server player base is toxic to everyone. r/wowservers has to be one of the most toxic subs I've ever been a part of. Don't take it personally. Sure, many of the private server players and the users on this sub are looking for the nostalgia, but I imagine there will also be a fair share of new players, especially kids that didn't play the first time around.
---
Gonna run skinning/mining while leveling.  Will sells the leather to vendors and hold on to the ore.  Once max im gonna drop skinning and take either engi or blacksmith.  Still undecided.
---
It was. It was pretty decent pre crusader nerf. The fireball would proc a lot.
---
Not a bad plan
---
Mining/skinning while leveling, drop skinning for engineering whenever you want. Some drop it at 40 mount, some at epic mount, but it’s your preference. Personally I’ll drop it once I get tired of not being able to use gadgets to level the pvp playing field, whenever that happens.
---
Engineering/Armorsmith. Enjoy the grind
---
I was wondering the other day just how many minor differences we're going to notice. I know pathing after WotLK is totally different than in classic, but I don't know by how much.
---
Ah well, at least we'll have DME. That was done with CC.
---
Its strange, I’ve always revolved my WoW gaming around a core group of friends I met during Vanilla. I’m planning the same for Classic. But for the first time I think I’d be down to jump in solo if it came down to it. 
---
The initial plan was to form a guild with the core of us, but a part of me is thinking it could be a whole lot easier to just join another guild with the few of them that are as committed as I am.
---
I ranked while obtaining a master's (writing a thesis), working 20hrs/week as a GA/Lab coordinator, teaching courses, AND holding an outside internship for a government organization, which totaled a 40hr work week, in addition to my own coursework.
---
You can very much do it if you are in the defacto top premade on your server. We were done ranking by Friday/sat morning. Typically had 3 or so days off, where we just kept tabs on other rankers. We set the brackets and all that, which were typically lowish (made everyone's life easier, but still unobtainable for randoms), but everyone played nice for the most part.
---
The premade schedule worked very well with my schedule. 
---
Tldr: you can do it
---
Hah, of course not. But blessing of freedom needs to be purged in WSG or you’re gonna have a really bad day.
---
Some people like to play different characters.
---
If you fap a mage will just sheep you, hunter scatter into trap, druid run away whenever he wants, shaman purge it, rogue blind +++
---
Its not a "i win" potion.
---
It's weird. I know there are other sites with a virtually identical funcitonality and site layout, because I remember adding myself to one a few weeks ago, but I wasn't on this one.
---
I’m half expecting to get smacked in the face the first time I try the DMW ramp trick on the treant packs. Will certainly make farming the BoE shadow resist necklace off the ghosts there a pain.
---
Probably the best option. The beauty of Classic is it’s designed so well that the experience you gain leveling is all you need.
---
It’s not to dump on retail, but the leveling experience there is incredibly bad right now, so it’s not the best time to jump in. A rework for the leveling process is definitely coming in the near future—likely for the next expansion.
---
Check out Bornlesszero on yt. I think he's leveled 10+ druids to 20 in the last couple weeks. You might not be going druid, but his routing is probably pretty good.
---
Hey, fantastic maps. Looking forward to when you remove Storm wind Harbour and Acherus. Where is the Than'dol Span that sits between Arathi Highlands and Wetlands?
---
I was excited and nostalgic to see many things I recognised. Did anyone else go through, zone by zone, saying, 'Yep, that was there'? So amazing seeing Thousand Needles as it was, Barrens unsplit and the whole of Stranglethorn Vale. :)
---
Well he did ask for pvp and weapon skill doesn’t matter there. Not sure who argues for axe spec though. 
---
Mace spec plus TUF ooooh we.
---
This was a great and comprehensive write up! Thanks a bunch!!
---
Always go for stats if you are dps. Many warriors use leather, hunters leather... if you are rolling a sham elemental you need spell pen so your spells don't get resistated and I believe that is pretty much only on cloth items in AQ40. Ele Shams have the unique position that they are a caster that can wear 3 armor types, take advantage of that, if a piece of gear has good stats use it no matter the armor type.
---
😂
---
Down with Fortnite and Apex Legends!
---
Why armorsmith instead of weapon?
---
You're not going to need more than the 12 action slots for a while in Vanilla/classic with any class, right?
---
Fine I’ll say it. 
---
I don’t get it.
---
yeah in a few instances its pretty critical things go exactly in the same spot
---
one would hope they have the ability to import the old mobs not re make them from scratch
---
i was trying to test the mage dm grinding route the other day on that lh personal server but there was elites in the wrong spots making it not possible. they prob did that intentionally to stop people doing it.
---
just an example though 1 mob out of place can change quite a bit
---
If you Horde than other Horde are your allies.
---
Honestly I wouldn’t mind if it was reposted every few days.
---
Hell let’s get a gofundme to take an entire page ad in the New York Times.
---
Welp my interest in shaman just went to zero.
---
am i remembering correctly this was a short animation from something like south park?
---
is there an animation or just this pic
---
The zone is also really far out of the way and higher level
---
drop in and sperg ouut
---
I know this is extremely irrelevant, but boy howdy are those class icons hi-rez!
---
But on my private server with made up numbers that TRY to emulate true vanilla enhance bad, not enhance good!
---
Hemo rogue with a slow mainhand and fast offhand was always a blast in pvp.
---
Username checks out
---
My suggestion would to be to play Alliance, but not as a Paladin. Switch it up. It’s your chance to forge a new path. See the game from a new perspective.
---
I have. And I've gotten to rank 14. I did it just like xantek said. And what he said encompasses essentially what the grind will come down to. Either you are able to have a solid group that can set the bracket that requires decent time investment. But nothing absurd. Or, you'll have idiots that break the bracket because the either don't understand they gain no additional benefit or they just don't care. In which case unhealthy amounts of play may be required. Or your server is so big and the premades don't agree on brackets which can cause problems.
---
Easy one. Start off skinning and mining. Vendor the leather, bank the ore. Eventually drop skinning for Engineering. When you drop skinning is up to you, but don’t do it before you get your lvl 40 mount.
---
Dude, remember, it's not Josh's opinion that counts, but YOURS!
---
Personally I think he's nailing just the right balance of knowing enough to prompt good questions and keep the interview moving, while speaking from the perspective of the 99% of the player base that never got the chance to kill, say, C'thun.
---
Hey no problem, glad you liked it! It definitely wasn't perfect though, I made several mistakes and I think a couple of aspects of the route could be cleaned up. Feel free to use it as a jumping-off point.
---
I was Herb/Alch for the entirety of Vanilla WoW. I feel like I used to find more than one Black Lotus at a time in Winterspring and EPL on occasion.
---
My favorite part was when agerock asked how much longer until the warlock was done making his movie.
---
*It's time for a little blood!*
---
Actually let the retail players have their fun with 8.2. Then the true classic players will play in peace. If they release it when the content is well repetetive then everyone would want to try it and the launch would be a disaster. Too many people logging in.
---
I say good luck to whichever guild attempts to break through a choke point at world bosses. Hunters, especially night elves are excellent skirmishers. Engaging the opposing raid in a pre-battle for control and space. The side with the better, more coordinated and more numerous hunters will have a very real advantage over the guild with two more rogues in the back instead.
---
Bringing 2 hunters is not wrong, especially on horde side where you can call upon shamans to provide the nature resistance. But i say, truly excellent hunters is a resource to the guild you will appreciate. And if you end up with 5, it's fine. Raw DPS is not everything, and you will find your hunters taking 1/10 the healing your melee is taking anyway.
---
So why do people raid exactly?
---
For the North American beta, it was great. Everyone helped everyone. Hardly anyone was playing during beta as it was mostly family and friends with a select few people. You would be lucky to see 3-4 people in a zone.
---
Hardly anyone had any talents (I remember priests getting talents just when hunters were a thing). Everyone's talents were all over the place along with no BIS list...or quest list/guides out. I remember at 50+, quests were scarce and you pretty much had to grind it out to get to 60.
---
The hype was there, but MMORPG's were very few and far between. I think the big MMO's at that time were Dark Age of Camelot, EQ1, Star Wars Galaxy and Asheron's Call....all solid MMO's at the time.
---
The only 'ghost' launch was them doing a 'sign up to (I think it was mmorpg or some other website) website, subscribe to it and get an invite'. I think the invite was for only 2-3 weeks but they later announced within this time that they are inviting those who are the top 2-3 per class per server. I won this tournament and it was the same one Joana went into as well (in fact, I think we were on the same server).
---
This is the only 'ghost' launch they did, but it was very well known that they were releasing wow when it came out. Advertisements were everywhere.
---
BFA and Classic appeal to very different markets, with the decline in players and the WoW refugee narrative that has been making the rounds I suspect that Blizzard will release the two side by side and report to their bosses that they had a massive jump in subs for that quarter. 
---
Then they will release the first round of raids for Classic right around the time the first raid for Shadowbringers opens, quarter 1 of 2020 they will push out a raid tier for BFA. Summer is a tough time of year for any mmo and with WoW already bleeding subs to FF14 they are going to be looking to slam them between the anvil of the more casual content of live BFA and the nostalgia hammer of classic.
---
Exactly. Just gotta make sure it works.
---
mmm, good old daoc :)
---
Been loving the show, Josh. It’s clear that you’re coming at this more as a host with great interview skills who knows how to ask the questions that get experts to fill in the story. If you knew everything you could just do a podcast where you talk for two hours, but that would be boring and we wouldn’t get the varied perspectives your show brings. Keep it up, mate!
---
I have that same keybind. It just feels so natural.
---
Farming them scorpid stingers?
---
[removed]
---
And crack open another Monster™️ energy drink.
---
Also when Alauraeden joins the guild and Lyuba stops what he's doing to say "hie". 
---
He's so polite!
---
Well I don’t have any mathematical work to show, but just a hunch for a few reasons. It’s likely to release mid summer based on the “you’ll be having a Classic summer” comment. I could be wrong, but they are very careful with their words. So I think it’s likely to have a release mid July to very early August. 
---
I’d also assume that they’d give a 3 month heads up before release. That’s typical for Blizzard, but then again this isn’t a typical project. They are aware that people are taking time off to play it though, and that there is very real hype behind it. Too short of a time between release announcement and release would probably be unwise.
---
Also, they haven’t even mentioned anything solid about a beta, so I doubt we’re getting one. If we’re not, than that means Blizz feels confident in their game so far. News posts are also ramping up in frequency, so we should expect major news soon regardless.
---
Is there a way to do this from within the wow file folder? Without logging in.
---
M8, you're on a enjoy this so much. This shit is so good is Crack maaayn. You're gonna think about it all day every day. When you're at work at school or in the gym. You're not even gonna go to the gym shots addicting af.
---
Nope. One riding skill for all mounts.
---
I can definitely see the case for ST. That Place is tough. I’d still argue SFK is up there in overall difficulty, in comparison to how powerful your characters are at their level. I can admit ST is probably a bit harder, but I can’t think of many that are much harder than ST, SFK, and Uldaman.
---
You'll catch on quick then. Most of us started with RuneScape or nothing at all. I wasn't really sure what a "party" was, I didn't know the difference between healers or tanks, dungeons or raids, etc. 
---
While current WoW *would* help you familiarize yourself with classes and races and very basic game mechanics, I really really recommend going in cold and just doing Classic when it launches. It'll only add to the adventure and excitement as you discover everything.
---
Snort*
---
Enhance with super windfury procs too for fun
---
This is a spelling error that I don’t like. Its’ “cmon” friccin morons
---
Making my toon and logging in just to find every starting zone packed. Then I would say hello and wished everyone luck with questing. After that I would log off.
---
Yeah it's "Heroin Hero" from South Park
---
Blood Mage Thalnos?
---
Doubt that'll be in the game, it was removed a few months after release.
---
Oh, thank God
---
Tiger riding was a thing, iirc. As a Night Elf it was inherent, but all other races had to get to Exalted with Darnassus.
---
(That may have changed by 1.12, I'm unsure)
---
yeah its in WTF &gt; Account &gt; \[accountname\]  
---
[bindings-cache.wtf](https://bindings-cache.wtf) and [config-cache.wtf](https://config-cache.wtf)
---
heres the list u can add settings manually [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Console\_variables/Complete\_list](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Console_variables/Complete_list)
---
as u can see  theres no setting for enabling action bars which is really strange but everything else is basically editable
---
...Isn't the point of PvE servers that you aren't automatically flagged in contested territories
---
I do have friends, but due to my current schedule and responsibilities won't be able to reasonably play with them most of the time.  I'll have an alt on their server and faction, but my main will be solo on a random server.  The same way I started out all the way back in vanilla.
---
Looking forward to possibly seeing you in the world.
---
They did originally have their own riding skill, like ram riding, tiger riding, and the mount itself was the bulk of the cost. But we don't know how Blizzard is going to handle this as far as I'm aware. You make it sound like you want all the mounts on a single character, you still have to get exalted with the other factions to buy their mounts.
---
Yeah that’s a good point. I didn’t even consider world bosses. Hunters definitely seem like a key component in securing a world boss. And yeah having a good hunter is a rarity as well. Anyone can level to 60 as a hunter, but one that is truly knowledgeable and skilled can do a guild/raid WONDERS.
---
:(
---
This isn’t abuse, this is simple business strategy. You don’t want your player base split between new content A and new content B in the same week. Numbers look bad for shareholders. I’m just looking forward to playing through classic. I don’t care when the phases occur, just that they do occur.
---
Launch day was crazy. They had to add new servers, this game was super hyped from two sides: people leaving MMoRPGs like DAoC and people who had played Warcraft 3 and wanted a taste of more Blizzard games. It was right on the cusp of online gaming becoming mainstream enough to have a HUGE audience.
---
There was an Open Beta that was super full and where lots of people started to figure the game out, but was only up for a week or two before launch.
---
Wasn't it the other way around? Riding skill is the bulk of the cost and the mounts are cheaper? 
---
Yeah exalted is gonna be a grind, but should be doable.
---
Vanilla was about ordinary character's rising to do great deeds. Retail has the world praising the ground you walk on and feels contrived af.
---
Haven't done private servers. Are they free? Do you recommend one?
---
Go in completely blind dude. It’s a blessing you have that option, seriously! Treat it as a journey, not a race.
---
Even though it's a proper business strategy for Blizzard, I think that we as the players can still consider it an abuse of the release timeline as it's not beneficial to us.
---
Only because of the guide I have access to and the burning of vacation days lol. Good luck and happy hunting
---
I’m so conflicted. I really want to play an orc, but I can’t bear playing a warrior again and being main tank to be a punching bag. So, that leaves me with probably playing a Shammy...
---
Shamans are fairly decent off healers, but I don’t know if I can truly walk that path...
---
I rolled a few characters on a pserver, ready to invest in the real deal
---
What if you don’t like beig ganked but do like open world pvp?
---
Never healed in raids as an alliance priest before?  I remember having multiple ranks of different spells as to not over heal and maintain maximum mana efficiency.  Maybe my healing officer was an overheal Nazi but, it kept things interesting fighting paladins for raid heals.
---
Shouldn't it be the other way around? You're taking WoW classic and leaving behind your life
---
The specific patch notes are a pretty good read [Here](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20765138375#post-5)
---
That WF totem as main tank...couldn’t get any better than that.
---
Abuse still isn’t the correct word.
---
As much fun and as many memories as you have from WoW, the game is business. Blizzard has to make money or there’s no WoW. Period. 
---
So if you want there to be a World of Warcraft, then you should be more understanding that staggering Classic content with retail announcements is the best way of keeping players of either/both games engaged. Engaged players are paying players. Paying players keep the whole game alive.
---
Originally the mounts were expensive and the training was cheap, later on it was reversed. I don't know if Classic will do this or not though.
---
Op obviously didn’t play a shaman in Vanilla. In fact I don’t think he even played in Vanilla lol!
---
If they include the original epic mounts that were removed later, and the mounts are expensive and the riding is cheap, then it will be straight up impossible to get them all. That would suck.
---
I'm not sure if that's a good idea because by Naxx people are so overpowered that PvE is the only content that works. Already by AQ can dps classes one-shot eachother and by Naxx it's just a race for whoever strikes first. The gear and stat reset during TBC was desperately needed.
---
That said I would love for a separate server to come along with new content. Maybe throw in Karazhan as a 20-man or expand some of the zones. Hell even make the zones complete like in Cataclysm while keeping the vanilla gameplay and style. 
---
There are so many options which is why I kinda want Blizzard to just release the vanilla IP and let people run private servers like mods. Would be so cool.
---
Log off and create a bank alt
---
That was with Ashjre'thul and bwl gear =D
---
note to self... going to need a cigar...  Anyone know any good places around OKC?  Haven't smoked a good one in years, and this will be a worthy occasion.
---
The rogues of my guild back in the day did Scholo with 5 rogues. Just for fun. Good times :)
---
Then organize some sort of World PvP event in the game. Even on PvE servers, willing PvPers can still World PvP.
---
Jesus then I can only imagine what t3 hunter stuff can accomplish
---
&gt; It's going to be removed after a few weeks from launch.
---
People keep assuming this.  Yet blizzard has not gone out of their way to specify a timeline.  I'm not saying they will not remove it, but they haven't said they will either.
---
Lucky fucker.
---
Warlock. Super strong in pvp and very fun.
---
I'm doing mining herb and will drop mining for engineering after getting mats, epic, and pre bis
---
&gt; If you fap a mage will just sheep you, hunter scatter into trap, druid run away whenever he wants, shaman purge it, rogue blind +++
---
And you'll go blind, and grow hair on your palms. It's eeeeeeeviiiillllll!
---
thats probably what the intention of this thread is tbh..
---
I feel Horde will definitely be larger. As the game has progressed, I feel Horde has become more popular. Orgrimmar was popular in classic, so naturally people will want to experience that. Also, new players that want to experience Classic WoW, at least the ones I have asked, have overwhelmingly said horde.
---
I have never played an Alliance character, but all my guildies refuse playing Alliance, so I’ll be playing horde for the 100th time.
---
Going through this now.
---
Horde
---
Orc
---
Fuck...what class!
---
Fair point. I hadn't thought of it that way.
---
And this is classic WoW...so realistically you won’t have multiple lvl 60s sitting around.
---
Probably a 60, 42, and a 19.
---
Not to sound like a buzzkill... But couldn't that have just been extracted from the Carbonite add-on who did it a decade ago?
---
As one of players in the original raid, I believe this happened to be the first Onyxia attempt too.  Brings back a few memories of names I couldn't recall on my own too.  Really was a long time ago...
---
Legit moved family vacation to this past week from mid July to avoid potentially missing launch week. Wife thinks it was work schedule conflict related.
---
Priest.
---
Classic will absolutely be more forgiving because it's going to be full of noobs at launch. pservers are full of people who have been playing vanilla for the last few years across several fresh servers, they've seen and done it all. I'm looking forward to playing with people going in with fresh eyes.
---
read the first 3 words and instantly downvoted.
---
Been waiting for this all week. Appreciate the time and effort you and everyone you get on puts into it.
---
Cheers.
---
Yeah, that was my thought too. In this current scenario, he's leaving WoW classic and taking his life back.
---
Jesus I've never seen a meme so thoroughly dismantled in such a simple comment.
---
Well, I’m guessing it’s going to be mid to late summer. They want to crush Q4 earnings, so no better way than releasing Classic and shitting money for the few months before filing.
---
I DO NOT see them pushing it any further to appease shareholders.
---
Class is the most difficult one to answer. Melee or caster.
---
Just roll PvE carebear
---
Don’t forget turn off cloak.
---
In sure you're right but with only 6 phases over 2ish years I'm not too concerned
---
He puts players to sleep for 15 seconds and you can't dispell it (or bubble out as a pally), it's a real pita. If the healer gets targeted for the sleep you're probably going to wipe.
---
I wish Blizzard gave the world its own name rather than changing Azeroth to Stormwind.
---
Considering how many years we're gonna have to wait for TBC servers, there is no need to fuss about rested XP tbh.
---
They are always kings of world pvp and needed in premades.  Only downfall is lack of pve dps.
---
This guy fucks.
---
Would you really consider it more bursty if it takes 10 seconds for a 3 minute pyro mage to kill someone vs the 3 seconds it takes for Ele to melt someone?
---
In vanilla no one cared about "getting them all". That wasn't a thing. People had only one or two epic mounts total, throughout their entire characters life time.
---
Mount / pet collecting is an expansion phenomenon that will not translate back in to classic.
---
I fully agree. To expand on this: Engineering has a lot of goodies for a Warrior.
---
First of all grenades are very cheap and can make for the Warrior's biggest weakness of lacking ranged control compared to other classes. In general grenades/bombs/mines/sappers can be used for additional AoE threat or damage.
---
There are several engineering gear pieces that increase both the PvP and PvE utility for Warriors, like for all classes. Warriors don't utilize them as well as for example Rogues or Hunters who can get out of combat to swap around gear, but they are still very strong.
---
There are items that are specifically good for Warrior tanks like the Force Reactive Disk and other items that are nice for dps Warriors like the Battle Chicken.
---
It’s not about numbers and you can’t dismiss the fact that private servers have changed the meta completely. If you think it’s so different that elite private server players will suddenly hop into classic and become total noobs then you are in for a salty surprise.
---
Little did you know this meme is meant to help the recovering wow addict. Who in just a few months will need our support to stay clean.
---
Does he mean blacksmith which is armor and weapons? Is armorsmith a professional?
---
Wpvp is the only pvp that matters
---
If that's how you want to hide from facts, go for it.
---
Thats why I felt weird playing other mmos like FFXIV, every zone just feels like youre in a little box.. its an odd thing to explain but you dont get that feeling at all with wow
---
I see a lot of people saying ST, but I personally had more difficulty doing Mara (orange/purple). It took ages to complete, and the slime ooze things in there could easily wipe a group.
---
Yeah I can’t remember what the economy was like in vanilla so I’ll take your word for it. Righteous orbs will still be in high demand though.
---
Do this with pally blessings.
---
Yeah, it's a shame that happened.
---
Faction imbalance will make this issue even worse than we're talking about. It will obliterate one faction completely and certain servers will be handicapped permanently after a rough phase 2
---
Best comment.
---
I don't see enough dots
---
Garithos did nothing wrong
---
Uh what? It takes only as long as the server takes to batch the spell instant cast pyro macro and one shot almost anyone.
---
Ok, I'am going to be fully honest with you: Whenever I see a Warrior alone in the open World I see a free kill, no matter the gear difference. I personally played Priest, Hunter and Druid for an extended amount in vanilla, but it is true for almost all classes.
---
FAP can give a Warrior a couple of free hits, but many classes can just get away from the fight w/o dieing and re-engage. Warriors shine in fights where people need to commit or when they are surrounded by friends, not in 1v1 and especially not in 1vX situations.
---
World PvP basically comes down to two things: How well can you engage when in an advantage and how well can you salvage a disadvantageous position? Warriors can do the former reasonably well, but they honestly suck at the latter if alone.
---
However I'am not going to engage on a Warrior who is running around with a healer, except if they pulled a high amount of mobs or if the healer is OOM. Even a 2v2 situation can easily go in the favor of a Warrior there.
---
Basically my advice is to do either of those things: Don't run around alone or *strike first*. An aggressive Warrior is way harder to deal with, because they are already on their target with an applied bleed and slowing effect. This way they can edge out fights even against their worst enemies like Hunters and Mages.
---
Shamans nerfed before classic even launches.
---
Good ol' Blizzard
---
Thanks for responding.
---
I am moaning but I have listened to about 10 of the podcasts and appreciate that the subject matter is being covered. I like your voice and tone I enjoy that you vary your pitch so i don't fall asleep. 
---
I appreciate that your style has developed and having listened to the first couple, to begin, I'm glad it has. (lol, some of those jokes.)
---
Getting back to the tour thing in my first point above I have some more on that. I think you are going to get time for other content, given that that the start is still some way off. 
---
Video games like this do appeal to the more nerdy types, its true but the people that went through Vanilla back in the day have almost certainly evolved as humans. I feel that you may be able to enquire at some of the more emotional aspects of the game without making viewers and interviewees uncomfortable:  How did you feel?When you first step into Molten Core there is fear and wonder. Those first two Molten Destroyers (Giants?) that you pull across the bridge, seemed enormous. Corehounds in the back ground patrolling, lava all around and it was like you were on the edge of something about to take a step into the beyond from which there was no turning back. In many cases, (mine) there would be people who have been before that you wanted to prove yourself to. There was probably someone that vouched for you. He stepped up to the GM to say this guy is not an idiot. You didn't want to embarrass that guy. You may have experienced the joys of Ventrillo for the first time that day and now you have people barking orders at you as you are learning about what push-to-talk is. Don't get in front of the tank, wait for 3 sunders.  You prepared your gear as best you could but deep down you new it was a joke.
---
Stress. pride, anticipation, fear, comradery, happiness, awe,...... All emotions that can be brought up simply by standing at the start of the dungeon.
---
This is all pretty windy and general but my point was, that if the content still exists in the game, go there with your old vanilla buddies and stop frequently and make them tell you a story about what happened that time on the ground under your feet. Maybe it will be usable, maybe it will just be research. 
---
Good Luck, Don't stop.
---
Sounds like a fast run. With no non-stealth characters you could skip all the trash.
---
That's my reaction too lol
---
They also made you be able to stop gaining XP so even in the retail version of the game you can have twinks at each level.
---
most likely intended
---
Assuming it drops as one of the 2-3 items per boss and you've got enough dkp :P
---
Yes ofcourse but if the other side has Paladins and your side doesn't have Shamans or Priests to dispell you are in a world of hurt. Shamans specifically are there to neutralize all the insanely powerful buffs that Paladins provide and to add additional burst with WF and NS to get past their super efficient defensive utility.
---
July 16th is becoming an ARG at this point.
---
As long as we get BWL and ZG fairly early on all is good.
---
Shaman of course. Have you seen their tier sets?
---
Oh man I forgot about it taking more than one person to do portals lol
---
I don't disagree with you buddy. I was just arguing semantics. For example, if we used your logic, Prot paladins are the best burst spec because they can spam /sit vs a mob and then come up and one shot you in an instant. But would you consider reckoning paladins to be the burstiest class in the game? Semantics.
---
Maybe I'm misremembering. I recall playing on PVE servers (as those are the only servers I ever played on) and getting ganked while trying to level multiple times.
---
It was like fifteen years ago but I still, I know I definitely got ganked. I remember running back to my body over &amp; over &amp; standing there in spirit form waiting for the guys to leave so I could get my body.
---
HOLY SHIT NEXT LEVELLLLL
---
Huh, I wonder if we'll have modern friend/ignore list sizes or the old limits...
---
How did you set it to meters instead yards? :thinking:
---
I'm gonna give you the no-BS answer to what you said because I've tried it myself:
---
\- you can only ever raid as ele when you're wearing a tier above the current raid you're doing, so if you were doing MC you'd have to be wearing T2 and BWL you'd need T2.5, what this means is you'll only be able to do content not on progression.
---
\- you'll never out dps mages/locks on any fight that lasts longer than 30 secs, the only time you can do that is if there are targets for you to cleave with chain lightning and those are usually trash packs and very very few bosses.
---
\- you'll need to chug manapots/ dark runes/ demonic runes/distilled flask more than any other caster and will need to downrank LB just to not oom in the first 15 secs.
---
\-  At one point during AQ, the transition to T2.5 for mage and lock will scale so much so that you won't be able to compete on dps even if you had infinite mana and was able to cleave CL on cd, that's how strong pure caster classes' spell scaling is in classic.
---
However:
---
\- You can raid as 30/0/21 as a healer in most non extreme hardcore raiding guilds, you'd need to use slightly more consumables than full resto shams( more mana pots + mandatory mageblood/ brilliant mana oil etc, would still be less than 50g respec costs though) and you'd heal slightly less , since you wouldn't be taking 10% extra healing and none of the HW enhancers you'd be pigeon-holed into raid healing, spamming chain heal and maintaining the required totems for your group, but that's perfectly acceptable in most guilds who aren't really aiming at speed running for world records.
---
\- You'd gain the ability to actually kill things fast in open world, both mobs and players, a geared ele shaman is one of the stronger burst damage in the game.
---
\- Bg premade spots guaranteed, ele king of bgs.
---
&gt; for a while
---
But to answer @spongeytwo, it depends. Some classes do not need the extra actionbars until lvl 20 at least or a bit later but Classic uses way more buttons and spells than current wow if that is what you are wondering :)
---
And like scoowee said if you are playing a healer then you will be using a lot of downranking between different spells.
---
And in PvP with engineering and all the different gadgets etc.
---
You won’t need the warlock for dungeon summons. 1.12 has summoning stones.
---
"World of Roguecraft"  
---
Oh man, the joke actually survived the last 15 years.
---
I agree in every situation but Zuldazar in Battle for Azeroth. I know I'm gonna get blasted for this but just go sit out there with ambience up, I can SMELL the feel of the zone. Actually literally, it's kinda weird when you imagine a smell so vividly, I hope I'm not the only one that experiences that.
---
You hope it's over 2ish years
---
Great show Josh. Every segment was, as usual, cast with quick-minded and interesting people with something unique to offer. You do such a good job of picking out interesting guests. 
---
Man Nineteen27 is fun to listen to. Dude's brain is just on. This was very insightful to hear about other classes from a skilled Hunter's perspective.
---
There's some NPCs that are flagged for pvp &amp; hitting them will flag you, but those are the exception. Unless you somehow flagged yourself for pvp and forgot to turn it off
---
I don't care how many other people are playing the game so long as I get to play.
---
First: your English is perfect
---
Second: thank you! These are my favorite types of quest
---
You mean T2.5 geared, T3 shaman gear doesn't have any + spell damage pieces ( only + healing).
---
Doesn't really matter either way, tbh. I think we'll be happy with whatever we get, despite the desire for something a little different.  
---
I mean, we ALL want something better, but at the same time, we'll all be happy with what we get. So I guess my point is to focus on ways to enjoy what we get, and do like we did in the old days, and FORCE what we get to become exceptional and fun! =D
---
The lewt baby!!!!
---
I can see Sept being the next window :p it will release when it releases
---
NS + ZHC trinket + CL = more damage than pom pyro if CL crits ( lightning spells have higher crit chance and crit damage ), so an ele shaman can do what a pom pyro mage does  every 2 mins.
---
When you’re a warrior, virtually everyone will view you as a free kill. It’s hard to overstate how different the experience is. You will be attacked by everyone, so you basically need to charge everyone so that you’ll at least have some chance. Warlocks by contrast are left well enough alone by most classes. Really couldn’t be a more different experience in wPvP. 
---
You can definitely kill mages and hunters 1v1 if you get the initial charge and use cooldowns and engi and potions and trinkets. But it’s always an uphill battle and once you let them start kiting you you’re basically dead.
---
Could hunters solo DM tribute in vanilla? I know people do it on pservers but I haven't been able to find any evidence (video) of people doing it in vanilla.
---
So you respond to an obvious trolling comment with another obvious trolling comment. \*yawn\* I tire of your games, you silly nitwit. Go ahead and hate on true greatness - the might of the Alliance - while rolling around in the mud and muck of your barely sentient civilizations, blithely ignoring the upbringing of your own kinds offspring. Do us all a favor, and allow me the honor of raising your younglings. At least they may learn civility, dignity and respect. It worked for Thrall, maybe it could work for yours as well.
---
10/10 would fap again.
---
... Is it not Meters for everyone?
---
claim all the other names i might want on several servers
---
Playing vanilla without sound ? what sort of barbarian are you ?
---
For real. If my Night Elf doesn’t do a flip on the the first jump I delete it and make a new one. I know it’s weird, but it’s something I’ve always done.
---
You dont ever get the classic, dad!
---
I hope you're right. Because I tried a private server, and it was annoying and hostile. Granted, I was just goofing around and didn't even max level, so I have a limited perspective of the raiding community. Also the PvP community was dismal. Quite boring, actually. Nobody even tried at lower levels, and I rarely saw any max level players in PvP gear, or even que'ing up. Seems odd for a PvP server though.
---
Hell yeah! Looking forward to it as well random-internet-friend!
---
Guess most people are going to be standing still for quite a while once they log on, enabling all action bars , fixing keybinds/ camera options/ quest text speed/ wondering why they can't find the enable show debuff duration and enemy health for like 10 mins.
---
Scholo.  Pally tank.  Druid healer (me).  No priest (no shackle).  We still pwned it.  But omg it was hard.  And we loved it.
---
You will for a warlock and maybe shaman.  Should be fine otherwise.
---
If you think you’ll enjoy it play it man. You’ll have plenty of time to learn to heal effectively. Don’t let other people talk you out of doing what you want
---
The game is not that hard. You will be a fine priest. Just remember to bring lots of water to the dungeon.
---
Personally, i saw this for the first time today. So you were right :)
---
Great! And your right I don’t really care about being “the best healer ever” just want to have fun. Thanks👍🏻
---
The thing is, leveling to 60 takes so long, and there are so many dungeons and other group content to practice healing before you even get to a high level.  You will have plenty of time to practice, so feel free to play what you want.
---
Ignore folks that will rage as you learn, and add to friends those who help teach you as you go along.
---
I personally found priests to be a grind to level but worth it in the end-game, but of course you do you. It is better to find the class that suits you the best and by level 30 you'll know.
---
You will love it! Also everyone loves a healer and you will be able to find groups easily too.
---
If you want to heal But never played before I’d actually recommend leveling in holy spec (with imp wand). Yes it will take you longer to level up but in dungeons you can heal really well even if you make some user errors. Leveling shadow will be quicker but when you try to heal in dungeons, if you have never done it user error will hurt you a little more.
---
Either way go for it, end game priest gear looks awesome too :)
---
Downvoted because I'm deeply jealous
---
There is a lot of gatekeeping in the classic community, best bet is to just ignore them an find more reasonable players to play with while your learning.
---
My first character was a priest. After that first deadlines run you’ll figure it out!
---
True, but in retail if you stop your exp, you only get grouped with others who stopped their exp when you queue for BGs
---
Not at level one, no. This thread is about what you will be doing when you first log in, not weeks later when you're raiding
---
Right, I said graphics. Without a graphic toggle, all they have to offer me is widescreen support, which I already have now on private.
---
At 1? You have no pets. You have no tracking. You have what, shadowbolt for a warlock and some sword attack plus a bow attack for a hunter? Doesn't take 12 slots
---
My 1st 60 was a priest back in vanilla. Was I a pro? NO. Was I enough to get it done? For sure.
---
&gt; bring lots of water to the dungeon.
---
Or find a mage friend :)
---
Yeah I've always used q and e for strafe and my main dps spam ability at 2. Sometimes I don't even bind 1. I've never bounded the a and d keys to any skills though. I feel like there's too much potential for accident fat fingering having them so close to your movement keys
---
Private servers definitely have more lotus available. Typically there would be a guaranteed spawn in the field of strife of AV that people would race to and then ditch out with deserter and repeat.
---
Yeah I've always used q and e for strafe and my main dps spam ability at 2. Sometimes I don't even bind 1. It's much more comfortable and easy to access. I've never bounded the a and d keys to any skills though. I feel like there's too much potential for accident fat fingering having them so close to your movement keys
---
Vanilla WoW will be MUCH MORE forgiving!
---
Retail WoW: Right now, you hit a button and queue up to for a dungeon. You warp into the dungeon with a pre-made group within 2 minutes. You start bumbling along and wipe....okay, might have just been a fluke. Wipe again...this fucking tank sucks. *type in chat: fucking newb, you’re an idiot.* Okay, kick the tank. 1 minute goes by and Bam a new tank appears! This guy is on his shit, we rock the rest of the instance.
---
Classic WoW: okay, LFG...10 Mins go by.....LFG....another 10.....Okay got a group. Can I get a summon? Okay, I’ll fly and run.....10 mins later. Alright, let’s kick some ass! Wipe....it’s aight....Wipe....fuck.....Wipe.....*Internally thinking: Okay, low key this Tank blows. Has he ever played this fucking game? Fucking retail nerd. But holy shit it took me forever to find this dude, if I kick him now I have to find another tank, fly or summon him. Fuck that.* *types in chat: Hey man, I used to tank. You need to hit thunder clap and some shouts to get agro on you.* We continue down the instance helping the guy learn how to tank properly.
---
This is exactly how I felt in classic vs. new WoW. Everything is instant these days, so everyone is expendable. You don’t like someone, usher in someone new.
---
I like to get everything set up before I start anything. Different strokes
---
No, but I just like being prepared. I also already have my keybindings mapped out so I can set all of them up immediately and put abilities on they keybind I want as I get them
---
Playing priest isn't any harder than the other healing classes. You just need to learn how to work around the five second rule and how to use precasting and spell cancelling. There are youtube videos out there for all of this.
---
We also don’t remember what the fuck we were doing when we played this game. My warrior was geared out in mostly T2, but I don’t know if I can even tank fucking Ragefire Chasm.
---
I would highly recommend ZT Cigars
---
Go play with the Chinese then on P servers.
---
go to sleep because i've been up all day waiting to get in and lock my name.
---
You're counting damaging of CL to 3 targets, hardly the same thing. You aren't going to one shot an equally geared person with CL like you will with pom/pyro.
---
&gt;There's nothing better than fresh noobs in a dungeon where I can mold and teach proper pulling techniques/order, mobs to watch out for, etiquette and procedure, and just general dungeon fundamentals.
---
What terrifies me with this statement is we’re going to be getting the retail WoW kiddies. These guys are used to pulling 10 mobs at a time and defeating them as they watch YouTube videos about dabbing. Anyway, they are going to be like wild mustangs that need to be broken in! I foresee tons of wipes with retail kiddos.
---
It doesn't. Only mages can open portals. It takes a warlock and two other players to summon someone to their location.
---
"Small number" is the key here. In fact, its a minute number compared to the total.
---
I love barrens chat!! N1gger!!!!
---
From the three healer classes, I can only speak for Horde side, Priest is definitely the most straightforward, especially with other MMO experience. You will do fine. One thing though: when you level and kill things alone, get a good wand. :)
---
You’ll realize that us casuals will outnumber the elitists 1000 to 1. We were all hardcore players in our lives, but that time has passed. I’m bringing 4 newbs with me that have never played Classic and plan on teaching them every fucking thing they need to know....if I remember.
---
If it's about reserving names, you can do it without logging in at all. Just keep on making characters without entering world.
---
This is the right mindset !  Have fun bro
---
There's literally nothing I dislike about this
---
#\#NOCHANGES
---
Even with max server population you still knew what guilds were the best and the names of the players. I feel like everyone had respect in Vanilla that can’t be achieved today.
---
Anyone who is using a shammy as a main healer in a raid is an idiot. Shammys are some of the best off healers in the game and support classes.
---
What are you talking about? Occasionally, there is a person attempting to sell gold, spamming a website, just like back in Classic, but they’re rare. 
---
In no way is the server “full” of people or GM’s attempting to sell gold. I’ve never had a GM attempt to sell me gold. 
---
I’m not sure why you’re attempting to mischaracterize every private server.
---
14 years says usage otherwise.
---
We plan on getting a casual guild together with former hardcore players that have families. I’m going to grind it out till 60, but realistically will only be able to logon for raiding after that.
---
I imagine you’ll have no issue finding a casual guild filled with former hardcore players.
---
I'm talking more about the runs I do where people do mess up. They don't really get flamed at all.
---
I mean sure, but that's changing the game. I am not saying there isn't "fixes" to this problem, but we are the ones insisting on no changes.
---
Me either but I plan to build a PC soon.
---
I'll have to insert my Sweeping Strikes, Whirl Wind, sword procc if we are talking about 1vX as a warr. I'm certainly dying, but I'm taking one down (at the very least) haha. But solo warr is frustrating for the most part.
---
People have gone through a few bosses using vanilla combat logs and flat damage abilities like kick to calculate the armor of bosses, but by no means does it mean every boss. Those bosses that were tested had quite lower than pservers which is no surprise because pservers intentionally buff armor so that melees aren't even more overpowered. 
---
And yes the original bre stacked.
---
Since when is ranking about getting a pve advantage?
---
I quit 4 months after TBC and picked up the game after this last expansion. I hit the instant level thing on my character and queued for a dungeon. We must have made it 15 mins into this dungeon and we wiped. Next thing I know, people are yelling at each other, someone’s mom is called a ho, and people leave. I’m sitting there wondering what the fuck just happened after one wipe.....I remember in vanilla where we’d wipe 10 times, go back to city and repair, and be back at it.
---
dude I get a gold farmer every single time i log on and about every 15 minutes or so.
---
Just release it on July 16th and make everyone happy
---
"...a sense of scale the universe has never had"
---
One of the big points that is just completely lost in retail. The game actually feels like a WORLD, rather than a bunch of disconnected zones with a million teleports. Traveling around the world actually takes time, and that makes the world feel vast.
---
Yeah because this subreddit doesn't spam posts about potential issues with blizzard statements, no that never happened with literally every single thing that blizzard has said. Sharding, loot trading, AV etc etc.
---
That's what this subreddit does.
---
At low gear levels and while leveling, BM absolutely tears people apart. It just doesn't scale.
---
Just go to NPCs and in the filter for zone type the dungeon. Then sort by level to get the bosses at top.
---
Of course having a random timer makes it a lot more difficult to camp. We don't know if it's a random timer, none has provided any kind of proof of it, and generally things spawn on a specific timer, rather than a dynamic and/or random. So it's fair to assume it was specific. 
---
And the difference on pservers of course like I mentioned, is that there's 50-100 BL spawns in each of the 4 zones, instead of 6-16.
---
I want client side transmog to be aloud as an addon. Not to be a lvl 15 running around in full naxx gear, but to be able to equip mage t2 shoulders once i have them and never get rid of them. without that benefit I wouldnt even put frostfire on except if I was the last mage who needed them and then only in raids. I cant loot like a clown the entire game, honk honk.
---
T2 full takes 16 weeks of raiding maybe less. A few months
---
and hotkey qerfcxz mouse button 1 and 2, scroll wheel up and down,  turn off profanity filter, show combat floating text thing, target of target, buff durations.
---
done :D i think
---
Lmao what is this garbage I'm fucking dead 😂
---
Get a life dude
---
Lord Garithos is such a boss.
---
&gt; Eventually you wind up traveling through time to fight of an army led by space Hitler, Riding a T-rex.
---
I think we had this expansion already
---
There was 2 different mount systems in vanilla, one pre 1.12 and one after. 
---
The pre 1.12 the mounts were expensive, and you had to train to specifically learn a type of mount. You needed exalted rep with the faction(except your own) to train that type of mount.
---
In 1.12 training was expensive but you could use every mount, except you couldn't buy them unless if you had exalted reputation with the faction(Except your own).
---
&gt; The solution is to make leveling from 60-70 hard as fuck, make it so you need T2.5 or T3 to kill shit out there.
---
As long as it's open world, it'll be cheesed in some way
---
that he has to spend hours of his life earning the reagents to use to save SOMEONE else 5-10 minutes. FUCK THAT SHIT.
---
Warlocks summons are for emergencies only.......they've got heal-stones to make.
---
You only get 40 bars of rested so, two levels. Waste of time. Before logging go to inn. Grind rested and do quests when not.
---
Lol this is honestly just hilarious.
---
can pull the boss outside trhe room, adds dont hit you.  ive only ever seen this on pservers however.  though retail ive prob done uldaman under 5 times ever so idk
---
gnomer is brutal at the end if the group isnt high enough level or you ass pull all tghe way down the final tunnel
---
My first character was a priest. Turns out that if you spec correctly and find the right spots that priests are really good at grinding exp.
---
I actually ground xp on my character to level 52 or so then started healing dungeons.
---
I met some great people because I was a healer, if you learn your class and take time to get better then people will remember you or invite you to their guild.
---
I still talk to the guild mates I found through that character more than a decade later.
---
the punch card exit is alright cause theres a mob you gotta kill outside too iirc, get xp if your group is fast and you got all the quests. (which rarely happens lmao)
---
I hope if they do implement the old style mounts, they make their price an exception and keep them at 1000g, even with 1000g training.  
---
I don't want there to be millions of the old style mounts.
---
You are correct, but I think wotlk had the option for either or, but I can’t remember
---
Or just go Warlock and nuke everyone with your 10k shadowbolt crit.
---
Which one? I’m on one of the largest, and definitely get them, but less than one an hour. They also have ignore.
---
Go ahead - miss a comma, use the wrong ‘there’, even capitalize an improper noun in the middle of a sentence. 
---
But this. This way of spelling c’mon is the most annoying. It is a completely different word and reads as such. Gah
---
You think there will be events?
---
I hope so, that would be awesome.
---
Can you imagine the people wanting to try it out and be all excited and log in to lord Kazaak just rampaging every starting zone.
---
Priest is a fine class for a first character. Healings really not that hard honestly. You'll do great :)
---
Can you link me a build for the tank healer spec? I am intrigued.
---
well /fart of course.
---
Quickly log out so I can make my next character and reserve another name.
---
This is what the game is all about
---
For those a little downcast by this post, I played shaman all through vanilla and mained enhancement and raided and did PvP. Nothing top end but ZG, AQ20, MC and I think a little BWL (though not much). Can't remember what PvP rank I hit though.
---
eh, its a lot of clips of a very geared rogue using cheap shot, sinister to 5, kidney, sinister, enemy is dead because of the gear and wrong lock pet etc.
---
Fucking hell I actually broke with that 😂
---
Lol I play on N*rthdale right now, it's shit and full of Chinese, Vanilla wasn't meant to have a third faction, l*ghts hope was born from the GM's on Elysi*m spawning fake rank 14 characters and selling them, the P server scene is pure shit and deserves to die.
---
Nice!
---
Now alliance. :P
---
Chasin' that dragon!
---
Lol hey its lyuba from my first reading guild &lt;PVP Enabled&gt;. Man they sucked. But lyuba had mad skills and was pretty much the only one pushing boundaries like this in their time.
---
nope. You only got 1 skill up per node (though it did give you 2-8 chances to do so). But it's also kind of tedious when you're just wanting to collect materials. It was a common complaint that mining should work more like Herb and Skinning and give you all of the produce with a single gather like they did.
---
I encourage you to switch to K3 if that’s the case. I’ve been playing for years on their servers, and have had nothing but positive experiences.
---
Since people ranking only  to rank7 and never looking back after they got their 2pc.
---
By having a PvE incentive, you have even PvErs engage in the ranking in order to obtain very gooy PvE pieces. It is a win-win all around. PvErs get couple few very good pieces and the PvP scene does not dry up, because you have the same premades roll over pugs again and again. 
---
On Nost you had a fair chance of getting a pug vs pug game. On LHC and ND you played against prem after prem after prem.
---
Nost PvP &gt; ND/LHC PvP.
---
Only one I can think of that is missing is Captain Sander's Treasure Map from Westfall. Available to both factions despite being from Westfall. Fun quest chain too.
---
"The pet's size is directly related to the level of the pet. Many beasts will dramatically shrink right before your eyes the moment they are tamed, though they will enlarge as they level. Pets such as rhinos are large enough to be a sight obstruction in certain areas, which can be to the player's advantage (PVP) or disadvantage (instances and raids)."

Speed leveling Horde on a fresh classic server craft a Lesser Magic Wand, and then go for the Branding Rod in the barrens. When things settle down enough for BFD go for the Gravestone Scepter.
---
no it doesn't.
---
They were added in 2.0.
---
Most "vanilla" private servers are reserve engineered from a TBC core and have partial functionality of TBC features unless the server owner has been REALLY meticulous and about stamping them out.
---
Ranks doesn’t require skill though just time
---
You sound like a blast to hang out with
---
It's hard to say. The BFA playerbase is about a third of what Vanilla was back in 2005, and we can't reliably predict how many people will be revisiting or trying out Classic. If we scale down the numbers, I think there will be more desire to raid, yes. Youtube is full of guides on how to optimize your time playing vanilla, so there will be lots of aspiring raiders trying to clear Naxx. I will, and you?
---
I don’t mind ret paladins, I mind they think they are entitled to join every raid and dungeon group. That is up to the group leader to decide.
---
It is free and you're not forced, I'm just happy they will be annihilated when retail classic comes out.
---
I too long for the slower pace of the old days
---
This is too funny 😂
---
[It was](https://youtu.be/izCBaGfGJCg?t=2394), Mark Kern talks about it here (at the 39-40 minute mark).
---
The cap was roughly 2500 concurrent online players, they could crank it up to 4000 if they would've wanted to but at that point the servers wouldn't have been able to handle it.
---
Why would you make alts on a different server though?
---
Yes, exactly.
---
i’d argue getting ret paladins is worse
---
&gt; it will release when it releases 
---
Big if true
---
A lot of angry people due to copies being oversold. Screw you newegg, I still hold that grudge. Lost a week of progression due to that.
---
I just hope it's a slow burn. I don't want to rush through this.
---
Bringing a ret so that anyone who gets outdps'd by him gets kicked?
---
My god, you've finally found a use for Ret paladins in raids.
---
If you think they’ll go away, you’re fooling yourself.
---
im not in a hurry
---
The hype was crazy. I was 18 at the time. A winters day in a small town in Sweden. The day wow was released we went to the store to pick up the physical copy, you could feel it in the air something was up. Kids carrying bags with game store logos everywhere recognizing each other.   The physical manifestations of us did not resemble where our mind was. We were are already in Azeroth, smiling, with a small dopamine high even before getting home.
---
At home the anticlimax was real. New releases is often hard on the servers, this is old news. But we wanted to play so fucking bad. Of to the forums to flame Blizzard, oh wait, their site was also down.
---
Azeroth was not totally new for us since we had played the beta. But man, back in the day Blizzard really knew how to create games. For me Vanilla wow is up there the with Starcraft and Half-Life as one of the best games ever made.
---
Even then there was hard core min maxers. I remember questing in Loch Modan, and suddenly an undead rides by on a mount. What was he doing there, and how the fuck did he already have a mount and 40+? What was he doing that I did not?
---
The original experience cannot be replicated. But nostalgia aside, WoW is objectively one hell of a game. And this summer we get fresh original blizz servers once again. 
---
Tldr: Launch hype was real
---
They won't but vanilla ones will be for cheap people and Chinese so they will be totally irreverent to westerners.
---
Cuz you got that 10hr. Because Chad.
---
Wipe the tear from my eye and go ham. Settings can be done during auto run.
---
Totally agree in those regards. I just don't see the point of not improving on certain technical aspects. In any case this seems to be the path blizzard is taking and I'm stoked that the general old school community is heard. And yes fuck sharding. If they shard after launch (starting zones onky) I dont think I'll play. It's the one thing that ruined retail the most.
---
Esfand looks like a legit nice guy. No homo.
---
Classic has Sub-specs for a few professions.
---
Blacksmithing can further specialize into Armorsmith or Weaponsmith, with Weaponsmith able to further specialize into Sword/Axe/ or Hammersmith.
---
Also most of your 250+ recipes REQUIRE a specialization to use them. Especially most end-game patterns.
---
(Leatherworking has Tribal, Elemental, Dragonscale (mail), and Engineering has Gnomish (weird devices) or Goblin (lots of extra explosives).
---
Become a goblin, play the AH and help fund your friends. Maybe get one of them to stream their guild raids for you privately?

No.matter if they release em fast or not, there will be plenty of guilds that will be raiding and doing things at all level for a long time, and there's also alt raids for guilds. you'll be fine.

You have an ammo bag equipped with over 2000 ammo in it. Is that a rogue in a hunters body? :)
---
I mean it seems like your thinking about 1v1 situation which is fine, i guess horde have an andvantage but its still pvp. The better player is gonna win. The better more coordinated bg group is gonna win. The more players you bring to a world boss is probably gonna win.

I mean i really nice thing about a long leveling process is that you learn quite about your class before you ever step into a 20-40man raid. As a long time priest player on pservers its not hard at all. Even if all you cast is max rank flash of heal you will still come up average in the early raids.
---
I have a clip from early on in a server where a mage with low mana decides to get on me in winterspring, and I end up killing him without fap as a low geared warrior. in most cases mage wins, but it all depends on the situation, wpvp is almost never a clean 1v1 duel-like style fighting, there's always either people passing by, mobs involved or something unforseen in the terrain
---
Shadow Priest &gt; All
---
I love what you did with Mythic, Heroic and Normal. It’s just raiding, no need to divide the system to please the casuals and the more hardcore players.
---
Priest, at level 17 you will be standing in front of the entrance to a cave. 
---
2 hours later you will stand on the body of a villan called Van Cleef.
---
Now your level is 18, the has been passed.
---
Next!!!
---
They aren't dude. You can not complete any of the quests while being in a raid. Even the Endboss won't drop his letter in a raid environment.
---
I can't wait to be spammed with the most OP attack in vanilla, frostshock
---
It can’t be that old, the game only came out in 2004.
---
It's a week established fact that when there are hunters on full T1 and full T2 in a raid, the T1 hunter will do more dps, but the T2 hunter is bugging the dps of all the hunters.
---
Well. Im giving ESO a shot in the interm. The game launched with a level 50 cap. Three expansions later the level cap is still 50 with all content relevant. It can be done. Granted game isnt as popular as WoW but that's a really high bar.
---
Who would downvote this?
---
Haters gunna hate. Keep us your good work josh
---
Well I started playing in TBC and I first went with a Druid because I thought the whole ability to turn into various creatures was interesting, I moaned Druid up until wrath when I switched to paladin and I’ve maimed paladin ever since. The look and feel of paladin drew me in from the start of me playing, they just sounded awesome BUT I originally didn’t go paladin cause my brother said they were just bad warriors lol. But I eventually tried paladin and have been a pally ever since.
---
My suggestion is just play what feels right to you, eventually you will find a group willing to take you regardless of the class/spec you play.
---
OP, ya da real MVP!
---
Im going hunter because of worktimes, Im going to have to solo. I also like to wpvp so its an easy choice for me.
---
Think of the role you want to do first tank,healer,dps. Than if you will pve ir pvp most
---
Very, unless you're in a guild that's stomping bwl every week, or the top hunter in your guild that's clearing it.
---
Playing without sound... what is this blasphemy?
---
Not much , play what you like
---
If you tell people you're a noob upfront, then 90+% of the time people will be happy to give advice.  It's the noobs who don't want to get better that everyone hates.
---
For you.
---
It's what I played in vanilla and most of my time in retail. I've always enjoyed the archetype. 
---
In vanilla I tried a few classes, shaman, warlock, warrior, and rogue. Got my sham to nearly cap before I decided to stick with rogue and I played rogue for years after that. Rogue isn't for everyone but I really enjoy it.
---
Are you sure? Fairly certain that was a thing in retail TBC
---
Ive been told my players they would never play an ally rogue or magic user due to orc stun resist &amp; wotf
---
/inventory
---
Everything points to july 16 and it would maximize their profits.  
---
  Release 8.2 in early june and you have people subbing for both 8.2 AND classic.  
---
  Not even mentioning things like the classic summer and what not, it just seems like the perfect date, a september release feels like it would kill the hype.   
---
  Also a reminder they've been constantly saying it's progressing quite well and the date hasn't changed.
---
I think a lot of people that claim people only like it because of nostalgia are just mad that they see other people enjoying something they don't like.
---
You can't control the size of a player's monitor, but you can control the view distance.
---
I'd imagine the "rush-mentality" from retail makes it harder in classic, where you really have to be careful about what and how many you pull.
---
Thanks
---
Well we don't know what classic will be like so who knows, maybe some things will be changed that will make more specs viable.
---
There are a lot of jerks online. Block them and move on
---
Horde has better pvp racials in fairly noticeable ways. They won't necessarily auto win you fights, but they can swing fights heavily towards you if you're a good player.
---
But it's a vocal minority.
---
A brutal madman.

Classic is the real battle for azeroth
---
Did you think of mage? I am so stuck between hunter and mage. I have limited playtime too
---
When introducing some of the players: “He is white” ??
---
looking at map from vanilla, it always bothers me to see how much potential the map still has for new zones and content on the two first continents
---
*DK Ghouls were severely OP when they were introduced.
---
To some people it might take longer, considering how tough it is. I can see it taking some people 4 hours just because it's so excruciatingly painful.
---
It was super hyped. The initial servers kept filling up like crazy.
---
That people are telling you BS. We knew nothing when we started the game in 2005, why should you not be able to learn and become better over time?
---
Will you join the game and be as experienced as someone who has played Priest for the past 5 years on P-Servers? No. But you can be as good as the guy, if you try. The game was never meant to be a try hard game, WoW Classic was designed for a casual audience, because any MMO before was so much more hardcore.
---
Play Priest, you will enjoy the class.
---
Alts in p2? Just dual box and get it done much easier.
---
This literally ruined MoP. I had quit before Cata released, and midway through MoP I tried to come back because some friends were still playing. I couldn't stand it though, because MoP was just... so wrong...
---
What I like most about this map is that it takes about as long to download as any image file did back when WoW released.  
---
Ok, maybe not really--as that was about 4 years earlier, but thanks for the immersive experience all the same :)
---
What if it could be put on a smart-tv with your current in-game location?
---
When exactly was goblin/gnome engineering added?
---
I don't like casters, specially for pvp but Mage is a very good solo too, you can aoe everything drink and repeat. You even get invites easier then Hunter for dungeons and raids which is good for tight game sessions.
---
Make myself reeeaaaalll comfy cuz i aint getting out that chair anytime soon.
---
Yes. WF totem gives a 10s WF weapon enchantment and other air totems can be placed during this time window so melees benefit from both WF and AGI/Threat reduction.
---
Right now I would say WoW 2.
---
Its usually in yards :/
---
While Rose tinted glasses are a real thing, (see: People insisting that the first Pokémon games are the best), Vanilla wow has stood the test of time quite well and is still a genuinely enjoyable and fun game to this day.
---
1v1 Horde has the upper hand (usually). However world PvP is by definition skewed by dirty tactics. Such as attacking on low hp, while a guy is fighting a mob or whatever.
---
Alliance will usually win in coordinated PvP at higher levels due to paladins.
---
You also might add to the list this quest item:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1357/captain-sanders-treasure-map
---
Even though the quest item drops in Westfall, a Horde character can take the quest. The reward is a nice 8-slot bag. I assume it might be irrelevant for a player on a PvP server, though :)
---
when 2.0 came out, the amount of xp needed to hit 60 was reduced by like 10%. This was later increased in mid to late TBC to like -30%.
---
More importantly however, because players proved to be utterly incompetent about NOT falling into the 35-45 quest gap by leveling properly, they FINALLY broke down and added new quest zone to fill the gap. They also added a bunch of new GY and FPs.
---
They also tightened level banding so it was more likely that you'd finish zones in one sitting instead of coming back multiple times, as well as adding some nice rewards for old quests in some of the end game zones (the trinkets from Words of the High Chief being a fairly well known example). They also removed most of the elite quests or SUBSTANTIALLY reduced the player requirements (usually to no more than 2). (a previously 20 man raid quest in Sithilus could be 2-manned or even soloed by some classes, and Battle of Darrowshire was dropped from 5 to 2 man (or soloable for some classes)
---
if you played prior 2.3, then you leveled
---
These are the 3 I'm on too OP. Leaning towards warlock. Mained mage in Vanilla and shaman since wotlk.
---
His clicking game was so on point that he even clicked the character screen icon to activate Nifty Stopwatch.  
---
That's next level.
---
My birthday is 14 July so there os no doubt Blizzard will do this for me
---
I'll play, hunter, rogue &amp; warlock, why u ask, coz those are  the ones i like more and i actually dont care about the charts and doing hardcore gamestyle.
---
Stacking on Lava Surgers in 2006? You were and you're still ahead of your time 😂
---
My original character was a human warlock - it sounds super cringy, but I chose it because the description made it sound dark and edgy, which was cool when I was in my teens. I didn't care about fitting into groups, group comps, and didn't even know what "meta"s were - hell, my brother was a mage and my buddy was also a warlock. 3 cloth dps in 5mans? Yikes.
---
If we're talking about today/Classic class, I've been bouncing between hunter/warlock for a while now but think I've decided on warlock. This time, I'm actually thinking about my little clique - we need some summons and range dps, so I'm going to fill it in. 
---
Plus, I think its going to be super fun to compare my skill level today and my skill level ~14 (?) years ago on the same class.
---
WTS Dirge
---
Activate instant Questtext!
---
Luke is the man! I'll have to check this out.
---
What about the three in the burned out Inn at the entrance to dustwallow? The shield, footprint, and badge.
---
I am going hunter, Want to be a rich main, Lw + skin cap him at 60, get him geared enough, level a rogue for stealth herbalism later game.
---
Hunters arent the best raid dps. well they arent good at all really, but needed for tranq shot and kiting, so thats cool enough for me.
---
I dont have it in my head i see it in my spreadsheet sometimes, i think its 10 or 20% less damage penalty for the first 5 points on all glancing blows wich is 40% of your swings.
---
Of the 3 I only have experience with shaman at end game. I loved that character, so much utility felt like I could morph into so many situations and it allowed for a lot of variation to play style. It has an amazing leveling story arc with the totem quests. A great hero class and a serious threat in pvp when played well
---
I remember my first dungeon to this day. I entered Rfc with a friend and saw some mobs with a golden portrait. Awesome we thought... So after 2 corpse runs se understood we couldn't do it. So like noobs we asked for ppl in general. A guy replied invite, ill show you kid. We did and get showed up, we were in aww looking at him a 60 warrior almost full epic. We entered and he boosted us while explaining how dungeons worked. We loved that dude and after that everytime we went to orgrimmar, half the time we were looking for him. We didnt even knew how to use the who function.
---
That mind soul got us even more hooked in the game.
---
Lets just say its so good that someone with 305 skill will always outdps someone with 300 skill on paper if equally skilled.
---
SHOTS FIRED
---
Definitely a no changes thing! Getting r14 should not easy and obtainable for anyone but the most hardcore. Besides you can still get good PvP gear from r8-r13. R10 for example is way more obtainable and much much much less of a grind than r14. 
---
And the blue set is really nice for PvP even against T1 sets
---
Same boat as you, meet some of my rl friends via wow.
---
Whats wrong with asking questions in /1? Thats what chats are for
---
100%. And I think I'm also guilty of this. I can be a little anti-social but there's nothing in the current game that requires me to be - outside of my guild and raiding. If someone wants to group up, I consider it a hindrance more than a positive because I'll level faster alone than with a group. The reason why Vanilla is good is because the game is harder alone, thus forcing you to group up. 
---
However, I have delved into the popular private servers over the last few years and have found myself guilty of ignoring a lot of requests to group up, etc. So this will be a tough challenge for others also. There were a few differing factors for why this was the case. One is that I didn't play on these private servers expecting to stay or get to level 60. So friendships I made I knew weren't going to last. Another reason was that I was following Joana's guide, which narrowed my focus.   
---
Don't get me wrong, though. I still had great moments with people I passed in my journey (more so than in retail), where I helped them with a quest or they helped me, buffed them as they walked by, or even just given them a green I did not need. I even experienced a rival battle between me and a hunter on the opposing faction.  He ganked me and thirty minutes later I ganked him back. And in the next 3 weeks I saw him a few more times. He leveled faster than me, but it still didn't stop me from spitting on him and getting a level 60 to kill him for me.
---
So I think over time Classic WoW will definitely change the mindset of the current retail players. And even though my experience on the Private Servers were more anti-social, I think it was due to my mindset of being a tourist on the private servers. 
---
Which leads me to my last point and that's the retail players who will play Classic as tourists. I think the solo players will have the same experience I had, but will change over time from a few encounters with people after struggling with a quest, getting ganked, or finding a group for dungeons.
---
Anyway, I've been ranting. I don't even know if what I said is interesting. This is just my take on it.
---
*Vaporizes*
---
I'm outta here!
---
from the beginning if I recall correctly. Or very close to it.
---
the only real change to profs was adding the ability for LW/Eng to switch specs by dropping the profession and restarting it from scratch (BS can never switch their specialization), and much later adding a hidden book that let you drop the specialization for like 100g (just LW and Eng).
---
(Tailoring in classic has a psuedo-specialization, via the Shadoweave questline, but it's not a true specialization in classic. It just unlocks access to a special merchant with some pretty decent early/mid 40's +shadow damage gear patterns and a quest for a nice cloth wrist and hood). It did however gain 3 true specializations in TBC (as did Alchemy).
---
&gt; Molting?
---
I lol'd at work.
---
Mage and warlock are not going to be more popular. Warlock is among the least played classes, whereas shaman is on the most played with mage. Even the polls back this up.
---
I don't plan on using any addons except those needed for raiding. Played on pserver and a blast without any quest helper
---
Interesting. Thanks!-
---
RIP Trueshot Aura
---
I just thought about what I want to do in the game this time around, what I enjoy the most and looked at the classes I was interested in. I made sure I picked the class that would help me achieve my goals in the game. Pretty straight forward.
---
Back in the day, I wanted to start as a Shaman in my RPG Guild, but before release we realized that nearly everyone wanted to be a Shaman or a Warrior and that we had no Rogues. So I became the "Scout-Leader" of our Guild.
---
I picked that class by pure chance and I enjoy the shit out of it.
---
I think you may be referring to the Darrowshre/Marshal Red Path machinima, but I cannot seem to remember what its called...
---
That or Tales of the Past III.
---
I started out early TBC. 
---
I’ll play hunter in vanilla. I chose hunter because my focus will be pvp and I enjoy classes where it is really noticeable if your actually a good pvper or not, so pretty much skill cap. 
---
Supporting reasons are that I like their ability to Goldfarm and their overall playstyle.
---
So you're going to replace someone in a dungeon in Classic, which historically takes a long time to form a group for, because they take a couple minutes to smoke?  
---
The other players in the group probably think you're a giant knob for wasting their time.
---
At this point I could do with my husband thinking about another woman, at least I'd have some drama to distract me for a while as we wait for classic.
---
Mornings in our house:
---
Him: 'Anything on Reddit?'
---
Me: 'Nah babe, anything on the forums?'

Him: 'Nope'

Me: 😥

Healing will be simple enough to learn if you pay attention to how much damage your tank and other party members take. The real challenge is learning how to be careful with your Renew and Power Word: Shield timing; those spells cause a lot of unnecessary stress during pulls if you put them on the tank before they aggro the next group.
---
NorthD, and ignore function is like putting a bullet proof vest on after being shot. Once I have been spammed the ignore does little to stop the ever repeating spams from different names. I have noticed they don't spam you with the same name often to begin with. I have also relogged quickly onto dif characters and get a message soon after logging, I have a feeling they can maybe see new players log on with the /who function?
---
Are those the healing pants?
---
Hunters do great dps over 90% of game content. Not sure what you talking about. They only fall back at AQ
---
You guys want to go down nostalgia lane go to https://www.warcraftmovies.com/machinima.php and sort by most popular to see the great machinimas that were made back then.
---
I think they also made a short about paladin Zinwrath (Zinwrath the movie). I dont recall where it took place but that might be it.
---
I think we'll be seeing simple mods (threat/dps meters) in the first 48 hours and more complex ones (quest helpers, map mods, raid group/party frame mods) in the first week or 2. 
---
Classic is based off of the Legion client, so we'd be lead to assume that Classic will be using some modified version of Legion/BFA's API. Basically: Vanilla mods won't work at all - Legion/BFA addons will probably have to be slightly modified to work with Classic.
---
Just out of curiosity, I tried copying modern WoW addons into the Classic demo addons folder just to see if it would work and it didn't recognize any of them.
---
*cough!* probably over healing
---
This is great
---
Too bad that it's horde ;)
---
true, but the overall dps will still be higher if u can keep a very high uptime of ur cat on the boss. if u only manage to idle sit him for whatever reason though (boss mechanics for example) wolves are better.
---
As both a retail and vanilla pserver player i can tell you the level of toxicity is essentially the same, the only difference is it's harder to fuck up as a new retail player because of the extremely easy dungeons in early game, end game retail (mythic+ dungeons, heroic raids), compared to end game vanilla also seems to match up 1 to 1.
---
&gt; I dunno, bit of a rant. Just wanted to get it off my chest because I don't like being shouted at :'( 
---
You're going to have to deal with it, as much as i hate to say this toxicity is rampant with almost every game that requires coordination, cooperation or competition, you're simply going to have to learn how to use the /ignore function more often, it will bother you at first but eventually you will learn to deal with it.
---
Perfectly balanced
---
I leveled resto in TBC and loved it. Slower than normal but I loved being a raidbot
---
They haven't changed the reputation part, you still need to get exalted with factions that are not your own to buy their mount (retail).
---
I will do like Ron Swanson and answer all questions with a question.
---
Today we have discords which will make blacklists even bigger
---
then you fundamentally don't understand what open world pvp is.
---
Not even an extended quest log? That little window is to tight man!
---
Absolutely ;) you need a bank alt.
---
I've actually never had alts, to me wow is about my one character, so I don't think I've ever leveled an alt higher than 20-something. 
---
This time I'm not gonna have time for alts anyways, but probably wouldn't have one of I did. I'm gonna play my druid, and I'm find love it
---
gnome or dwarf anything is good
---
Can dwarfs play mage? Wouldnt a human mage be better then say a dwarf hunter at end game 60 pvp. With decent gear.
---
Dwarf rogue  
---
Gnome rogue  
---
NE druid  
---
Gnome mage *winks*
---
yes, those serpents have a ranged attack (lightning breath) which is nice for pulling/peeling, it also ignores armor as it is nature dmg so those pets have rly good dps aswell. another big benefit of those serpents is that they can eat bread (so they can eat mage food f.e.), cheese and fish so easier to handle than for example raptors who only eat meat. 
---
i mean owls are better overall but u have to go to the ne starting area to get one. especially when servers start there will be a lot of action there. depends if u want to invest that time. could be quite fun though if u are looking for outside the norm tasks.
---
ideally u rly want to get those ranks as soon as possible as it increases ur level speed. 
---
so leveling a hunter very efficiently is also knowing and managing where and when to tame other pets to get spell ranks while having ur main pet in a stable close by.
---
Oh, I’m sure if they’re whispering you, they’re using /who. I never get whispers though, as on K3 you have to have at least one character at 20 to talk to people outside of a group, so they use /yell
---
I'll check them out.  Their website is pretty legit.
---
You say ally rogue but orcs have 25% stun resistance so..??
---
Nope, but they can be rogues or hunters, which are good in 1v1 world pvp.   gnomes can be rogues and mages which are good in 1v1 pvp.   if you dont want to play these then just play whatever you want  cause youve already exhausted all the good options.
---
If you anit top, you anit notin' but utility my dude
---
Made a gnome warrior as a joke in TBC. Ended up taking her seriously enough to do 2v2 arena. From that I found her to be so fun that I mained her in Wrath. I was very successful as a warrior in Wrath and I can't imagine maining any other class.
---
This is literally the biggest reason why I want the old 2k/2.5k (active) server population limits.  
---
And I would PREFER balanced populations, but I guess that is highly unlikely.  
---
This will make it a little easier to ignore the badies/annoying/hostile/snowflakes... w/e you don't like, just ignore! And the rest of us will learn to be less bad/annoying/hostile/snowflakey so we can get along with whoever is left to play with, once nobody else is listening to us anymore.
---
It is beautiful on the inside.
---
Dwarf hunter is better then a human mage? Wouldnt mage be better in any case at end game pvp
---
Human mage is still quite good, but perception won't help much in wpvp, it's best in 1v1 when a rogue vanishes or in wsg.
---
Definitely. I agree with that.
---
Hunter is my jam, so it has to be that, at least at first. It's much easier to decide when you're way better in raids with a certain class!
---
Discs of Norgannon in Uldaman. I think horde also gets the quest.
---
You've got some class...  
---
I like your comment about the zones, too though. And personally, I always felt like many different zones were so much further away than they really were...
---
&gt;  it seems like the current player base is almost completely unforgiving  of any mistakes, and expects absolute perfection from anyone playing at  all times. 
---
By the time classic comes out itll have a much larger population than private servers. There are people who didn't and possibly still don't know they even exist on top of people straight up not wanting to play them. The reason this matters is because itll seem like there's a lot more elitists and assholes among a smaller pool. 
---
&gt; I'm just wondering if I can expect more of the same when classic actually releases? 
---
Yes, doesn't matter what game you play, elitists will exist.
---
&gt; I'm really hoping it'll be a bit more... forgiving? And I'll be able to  learn from my mistakes instead of being shunned and alienated because of  them? 
---
Itll be mixed, in my experience with most MMORPGs the vast majority of people I get grouped with either wont complain or will just leave. The people who are outright raging or the idiots who think they're good when they're not are far less common, but when they do happen, its never enjoyable obviously. Then there's my own small contribution to rage once in a while.
---
Yeah, MMORPGs may not be for you if you cant accept and deal with it happening on occasions. Its inevitable. Put em on ignore and move on, its not common enough where I would let people ruin my enjoyment. At least when i started...I was having way too much fun to give a shit, but admittingly nowadays my patients is much thinner. 
---
There is a bigger chance until you kinda learn to play the game at a relatively basic level that you will get more flak, but even just knowing enough to be able to fulfill your role and if you're not amazing at it, you'll see far less complaining, but generally most people are gonna expect you to know the basics at least.
---
azért vannak itt még magyarok, úgy látszik :)
---
Mages has no fears sleeps charms or stuns and you complain about horde racials? :thinking:
---
"Hey, I know you're in the Shimmering Flats, but I really need you to take this box of stuff to some guy on the other side of the world that will probably take you 2 hours to travel to, likely getting very little reward, and quite possibly dying three times on the way. Thanks!"  
---
Me: "AWESOME! ANOTHER ADVENTURE!!!"
---
Rofl
---
What do u mean
---
You could use this meme for pretty much every class lol. Depending on the scenario, many classes were relegated to one particular role because it was more optimal than anything else in a team environment.
---
If you put a PW:S on the tank, you will wipe. It does not generate aggro, he will be rage starved and not able to tank.
---
Dwarf shadowpriest Maybe the strongest 1v1 class in vanilla
---
&gt; Unbreakable
---
*ready, steady go! plays in head*
---
Careful that the "everybody needs healers, there are so little of them" might be a fallacy. Private servers generally show a lot of healers and not enough tanks.
---
No BL in Classic tho
---
I do not know about Staysafe or Esfand, but Tips gets a lot of shit because he mlre often than not is simply not saying the truth. He is misinformed a lot and doesn't do enough research.
---
Awesome then we will do a run with that being the plan
---
Easy. Stick with Paladin. Think of that sweet, sweet T2 Paladin set :)
---
What's the music at 7:14?
---
Undead and orc don't counter mages so it's not an issue if you plan on playing mage in PVP.
---
teal
---
BUT I SEEN A PALADIN WITH FULL WORLD BUFFS AND CONSUMES TOP A DPS CHART
---
So your saying mage is a great choice for ally pvp in 1v1 &amp; world pvp?
---
Jesus dude. 4 months and sleeping til 10. FML
---
Yeah it's pretty good, a lot of CC and burst.
---
There was some cons to being a dwarf priest in classic but i cant remember what they are. Do u knkw any
---
Probably 3-4 months a phase. I highly doubt they go through each phase and discuss the duration separately unless the community pressures them to.
---
I loved BC so much, it is no doubt the best game I have ever played. But that might be due to the fact that I started in BC and never played Vanilla WoW as it was.
---
Multi-box and do both
---
Send em off to Disneyland for a week my man, I booked a trip for my girl and her friends because that's how nice I am.
---
Never got this. IMO Stormwind &gt; Org. Mained horde for years but I always miss how nice things look on the alliance side rather than some shithole hut village.
---
I Will do All the settings after that roll a joint, smoke it and start the long waited Journey
---
fun fact :) would be cool if Blizz add it to the game
---
Quite liked this! Looking forward to some other profession guides :)
---
Mage is the least fun in raids and dungeons out of 3. The pvp is much more interesting in comparison but it has a very “on the edge” playstyle, since you’re so squishy and got no heals. At the same time, your skill (and engi items) will have the most effect on your success in pvp, the skill cap is high. You have limited resources in terms of mana and cds and you rarely just spam damage, instead either setting up for a kill (in small-scale encounters) with cc/cs the healer into nuke the target or being helpful (large scale), mostly peeling with sheeps and rank 1 blizzards/frostbolts.Mage bonus points are portals and free water.
---
With Warlock you get more flexibility in dungeons (sometimes raids), since you can engage in some memery with infernals/demo specs that don’t sacrifice their demons and micromanage those or play the minigame of keeping all of your dots up. Warlocks can afford to be more “bulldozery” in pvp, dot you, fear the healer, dot the healer too because fear never breaks, soul link or siphon life, healthstones and death coil, there isn’t much more to it. Keeping track of your pet is fun too. Or you can go the destro route and be a mage with worse survivability but better and more consistent burst. Bonus points are summons I guess.
---
Shamans are fun if you enjoy healing and bringing value you bring to other people. Totem game is fun and nothing better than seeing your warrior party buddies get WF procs. I find healing in dungeons more challenging and rewarding than dpsing, since you are the backbone of the group and sometimes get to decide who gets to live in sticky situations. In pvp you get nice burst that can overwhelm people, totems are your defensive tools with timings and correct placement of tremors and groundings, but sometimes you feel the lack of other defensives, cc and slows that are not on cd or dispellable. Btw, rogues can’t sap you in ghost wolf, so use it for capping arathi bases.
---
Early Happy Birthday! :)
---
[This is some good shit bro!](https://imgur.com/a/6mg7UHI)
---
The world will always need more healers.  As a tank I encourage anybody willing to take up the job.  Priests have a few extra mechanics to learn in the long run, but are needed just as much, if not more than tanks at level 60.
---
Yer, mage is a great choice for 1v1 PVP. Frost mage is incredible in PVP in the right hands.
---
I'll play hunter and warlock. Warlock was my first character in BC when I started playing, I chose it because I liked the lore and how it looked. I'm also rolling hunter this time because I think they are insanely fun and cool with the pet taming, I won't have time to be a top guild raid dpser or pvper
---
Harder to get a spot in raids as Shadow Priest, as most raids only take 1-2 of them. Other than that they are pretty solid.
---
Maybe mage portals required multiple mages to cast.
---
gotcha. damn thats a whole lot utility considering only one class can be top at any point. rippp
---
ROFL. I think feral was alright on Alliance. Biggest problem was that they sucked compared to rogues &amp; warriors on horde side because of WF.
---
I played every class in diablo 2 to death for many ladder resets.  In the beginning of wow I picked warrior because the D2 barbarian was the easiest to get rolling for me.
---
I ended up trying out a warlock alt at some point.  I also had a rogue, but never got too far with them in vanilla.  Warrior just stuck.  Sometimes the first pick just needs a bit of inspiration.
---
If anything they will just make a 1% drop rate gray item "Broken Talisman of Binding Shard" for shits n giggles.
---
I think you and I have wildly differing definitions of "a while".
---
I'm gonna predict a June 10th release
---
I believe the Carbonite addon included a map like this.
---
It means nothing if we dont have a good idea of by how much
---
This post made me think back to when I first started playing vanilla WoW.  I came over with my guild from EQ during the open beta and my first thought was instantly about the graphics.  I was like wow these graphics are so good ... but so cartoony it is kind of ridiculous.  Obviously I got used to it pretty quick because graphics alone won't stop me from playing a game but at the time the graphics for WoW were very good (EQ characters are blocky in comparison but with a more "real" art style) but the style was awkward.  I logged onto a client a while back just to see the world for a few minutes and my first thought was ... wow this looks bad.  Either private servers have bad models(unlikely) or it just shows how much time has passed.  It went from amazingly smooth graphics for models/world to basically being hard to look at.  Still going to play though.
---
So like 5% extra dmg?
---
except... its an annihilator... poor unlucky range dps
---
They think allies wait 15 levels and do Grey quests just to gank horde lol
---
They’re obsessed with us
---
That doesn't make any sense, for one you can't do much with a WoW name, and two it's been over a decade.
---
You said yourself that Horde has PVP centric racials. They were just ideas.  
---
Fine, eliminate rogue from my list.  
---
Any race mage: They'll get absolutely busted in half by shamans because of purge. So you can't be a mage, sorry.  
---
Looks like you're a druid. Have fun.
---
Actually tier 1 for hunter is actually better for pure raw dps IF you have a tier 2 hunter boosting your damage (with the hunter t2 8/8 expose weakness debuff)
---
Is druid better then dwarf Spriest
---
It means horde tanks has to use more threat gear and thus play more squishy. Or of course you can be wussies and force melee dps to be more careful. In general this mean the high end horde meta is somewhat chaotic and wipes happen a lot more than on alliance, though when mastered horde can have an advantage due to windfury dps.
---
Or add a vendor named  after the toon.   When you go to buy it, it turns I to the diminished blah blah blah.
---
And he's like oh no!   I've had that for 15 years and it never broke!
---
That would be a great way to troll people lol.
---
This is why I'll be playing tank with a healer friend. We can make the lowly dps summon us every time
---
Gnome &gt; Human for mage
---
They're not to be used carelessly!
---
If Classic were to actually dwarf retail the implications could be immense. Imagine a new expansion based on Classic that does not repeat the mistakes of the past. One can only dream...
---
I'm using that now thats amazing
---
If you want a really fun PvP spec then I say roll a mage and spec so you can use presence of mind and pyroblast. It's like game over for most. Except warlocks....
---
There will probably be some sort of closed beta or datamining before launch that will allow addon developers to get a head start.
---
Legend! Adding this to my list of classic resources ready for launch, thanks a lot!
---
So basically you made this post to argue to every reply that human mage is the better choice.  
---
Why did you even make the post if you already know what you're going to play?
---
Warlock absolutely destroys Ret, absurd comment. Locks scale out the ass.
---
Vs Noobs Freedom pot on a warrior is almost a instant win because they dont know how to handle it. VS a experienced pvp they will just control you or pop one themself.
---
But if u are planing on farming pve noobs in world pvp Fap warrior is fun.
---
No im just using counter arguments to gain perspective. Would u say theres a better option then human mage yourself?? I think dwarf priest might be the best but im not 100% sure
---
&gt;I don't know why Alliance players are always 15+ levels higher than Horde players in the questing hub of Hillsbrad Foothills
---
Because hillsbrad foothills is the only questzone in the game where horde and alliance quests at a signficant different level range. Hillsbrad is opened up for hordes at like 20-22 at lowest, and they have quests there all the way up to 35ish. Alliance on the other hand does not have any quests there before 30. So all alliance players in hillsbrad will be around 30, where as horde they range from 22-32.
---
I start to play this:.  https://youtu.be/dBnpughpVlk
---
And then off into the world with my shaman.
---
&gt; The reward is a nice 8-slot bag
---
Retail players on suicide watch
---
I hear you mean, I was playing Druid in horde side :(
---
At this point it isn't worth it for me to invest in leveling up and what not with classic so close.
---
&gt;Most specs in vanilla are viable but not optimal and unless you are having serious raid DPS or HPS issues those specs shouldn't be outright shunned
---
What defines viable and optimal. You can literally clear cthun with 30 man what a flametongue dagger shield enhancement shaman is also viable but not optimal because you can clear the raid without him?
---
Iirc these quests are not started by finding an item but given by objects in the world.
---
Empty spot can't steal your BRE that's why.
---
LFM MOLTEN CORE LINK ACHI OR NO INV
---
Not sure population wise but there are private servers not just for vanilla WoW but for all stages of the game.  People are interested in more than just one small section of WoW (sorry to disappoint you).  So the point is ... do people want Vanilla? Yes.  Do people also want TBC? Yes.  And WOTLK and probably other expansions too.  I personally want the versions I played vanilla and TBC and if I could only choose one it would be hard to decide but I would probably still go with TBC.  Classic vanilla WoW is the most reasonable starting stage for Blizzard to start "relaunching/remastering" their MMO.
---
You make it sound like if they never launched an xpac that people would never have left the game.  Sure some might have stayed 5/10/14 years but everything dies eventually and you can only do so much sideways progression before it feels like you are on just as much of a treadmill as vertical progression.  Also I am basing TLP off EQ because that is a large part of why EQ is still around (and still releasing expansions).  People like replaying their favorite parts of video games.
---
I guess really only time will tell how long the high interest in classic is.  I personally am excited to play but will also admit that I probably wont be playing it 10 years from now.  Will you?
---
Link Achievement, no curve no inv!
---
That + hide cloak, disable error speech
---
Hard to say. Druid is god-like, but shadow priest is entirely OP in vanilla. I avoided saying it because someone might be like "BUT UNDEAD DROP FEAR DOE"
---
Yeah or even pinned. The more people that sign up, the better
---
When you play it you realise that it's simply a better game then any expansion since.
---
Priest is rough to level but in groups everyone will love you!
---
Raiding as a healer seems like a big responsibility but in reality it's not that bad. It's the idiots that don't do mechanice and wipe the raid that people get angry at.
---
remember it doesn't matter about the overall experience of the game as long as it benefits OP
---
It could be, it's been so long ago... can't wait to jump back in, hopefully bit more informed now ;)
---
yes (Hi Lurp)
---
He just didn't think enough if he doesn't see any downsides.
---
This tells me you will regret playing alliance. I had a similar conundrum. Played alliance paladin on private servers only to deeply regret the time I'd invested by the time I was around level 30. You're Horde for life my Bro :)
---
If you want to win, just get good
---
Yup I agree, I like earning achievements but it creates even more of a toxic experience in the old world
---
plot twist
---
Oshit really? I rolled my shaman in bc and thought it was always there.
---
Blacksmithing is a waste of time unless you want to be the guild armoursmith/weaponsmith. Mining can be good though. Eng is great for pvp. Herb/Alch is underrated.
---
Basically I'd say either mining/eng, herb/alch, or just grab whatever gathering professions tickle your fancy.
---
Because they're Danish. No other reason needed.
---
“Liek” reminds me of PurePwnage
---
It might be worth cross-checking with the list of quest-giving items on [classic wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/items?filter=6;1;0)
---
Go with your gut if you're really undecided. You want to enjoy the character you invest days into.
---
RACIALS AREN'T THAT IMPORTANT! PLAY WHAT MAKES YOU THE MOST HAPPY AND EXCITED TO LVL 2 60!!
---
That being said, I'm rolling dwarf shadow priest, even though I want increased spirit, I can't say no to SF
---
That Warcraft 2 music made me nostalgic. What a masterpiece I forgot about.
---
I was thinking of rolling a dwarf spriest. I have 2 worrys though, can u let me know what u think? Raids usually only take 1 or 2 spriests, and its not noob friendly. I havent played wow in ages so i might be a worse player then others.
---
Hence "still quite good".
---
Gnomes are great because of the int bonus, but more importantly escape artist. Human mages are by no means bad though, and the rep gain is so underrated!
---
You are fucked in the head, aren't you?
---
Nope, I had several skill-ups on a single node for each successful mining. May be it was pirate server bug, but it was that most known server, so I doubt it. I did not found it tedious, I liked it much more than today single cast model, especially because it allows to people to mine simultaneously rather than trying to steal a full node.
---
I just don’t personally think it’s as much of a nuisance as you guys i guess? People get triggered over such small things. How is having a baseline expectation  of an achievement any different then asking people to meet on top of bank for an inspect? Neither are toxic in my opinion.
---
Yup, added in 2.0.1
---
On some fights you can, but on some fights no matter how excellent you are, your pet will not survive unless you pay a priest to heal bot your pet.  An excellent hunter can do pet jousting especially with pets that can dash but that will only take you so far.  Bosses with random AoE's like the rain of fire boss in MC, or high damage frequent AoEs like Huhu(unless your soakers are all scooting closer than your pet and don't die) your pet will eventually die from accumulated damage.  So yes your pet will live longer if you are an excellent hunter and micromanage it well, but on some fights your pet is just SOL.  Then again I haven't played in 14 years so I could be misremembering how many random/large AoEs are in the game.
---
We just dont want any small changes, that creates the possibility for other changes and thats what gave us retail.
---
I started out on Bloodscalp EU many, many, many years ago. Really got immersed in the questing experience of WoW. Grew to love the lore. 
---
Then this one time, (Right around the launch of TBC I think) I remember the server going down, so I went browsing for an alt server to play on and stumbled upon Roleplaying servers.
---
Reading the tooltip description immediately sold it to me. You mean I can get ***MORE*** immersed in this world? Sign me the hell up.
---
Eye of cthun from lbrs
---
How to get your post downvoted in one easy step.
---
Your pet damage basically capped when you go your best pet at level 60 since they dont scale with gear.  So in MC your pet might do 20%(?, im guessing here) of your damage, and it goes downhill from there.  It is not bad damage (basically a free DoT you dont have to cast and doesn't take a debuff slot) but that is about it even with BM spec.  Keep in mind that your level 60 pet has to melee hit level 63 bosses(?) but can't get any of the hit gear etc that other melee users can.
---
I'm just gonna sit down and cry by the joy of happieness for being finally home again.
---
Because it wasn't in Classic.  
---
The fact that sharding is on the table is a huge point of contention already. They're thinking about implementing sharding *purely* for technical reason.  
---
Achievements is just a crap system with no technical necessity.  
---
Go play XBL or retail.
---
I think you need to actually buy the game to play classic, I don't think there will be any free trials like they have now. If anything, itll be like the original free trials that only last 14 days.
---
Banning people from seeing content unless they've done it is the epitome of toxicity you fucking idiot.
---
Calling me a fucking idiot is toxic... I’m just talking about a subject I wasn’t even super opposed to or for... wanting more insight.
---
If u want to see toxicity look in the mirror because I’m not being negative here. You are.
---
I was sooo disappointed when I found out that vanilla didnt have achievements, and therefore there was no incentive to gather a raid group to do the [For the Alliance] and [For the Horde] achievements. That was literally the absolute best PvP experience I've ever had. Hiding out in the barrens, waiting for everyone to gather up before launching an assault on Orgrimmar/Stormwind was euphoric. Everyone was so hyped. 
---
If anything, please give us those achievements, and the black war bear with them. Please blizzard.
---
Thing is that there's a community in vanilla.  People remember and spread the word.  It's a different type of achievement to be known for something without a tag or notification in the game saying as much. If you think this is important then you clearly don't understand what everyone is striving for in vanilla.
---
WAIT I ALMOST CAUGHT THE DRAGON
---
Was leveling a Druid originally but then World of Roguecraft came out, so being a kid and all that, I naturally switched to Rogue and never looked back :D
---
Nice attitude, you must be fun to play with.
---
I hope this will still be possible on Classic. It's worth the pain for the Flask of Supreme Power recipe from Ras.
---
Yep.
---
I'd love to help, just start by breathing deeply my friend. You really think you can't handle leveling a priest? Christ for 12 levels you're spamming smite + 1 SWP until a Wand (would rec enchanting. Ppl need wands early, could be sweet cash early on in alliance capitols) in raids, yeah shadow priests might not be THE dps that is 100% on everyone's radar, but you won't have trouble finding a spot as a reliable guildy ranged dps (caster). You're no noob, believe in yourself. You wouldn't be here if you had 0 idea. Just breathe, and wait until blizzard provides a release announcement - like the rest of us slobs.
---
 I've NEVER leveled a priest past 30 or so, but that's why I want to do it! It's a new fun challenge where I don't need to listen to what others may deem as imperative. That's the whole point of classic - to immerse yourself into the great and wonderful world and survive + grow as a well-rounded player.
---
There is no perfect, right answer. And three more people try to perfect the process, the more time they waste while others are climbing and grinding to 60. Food for thought, I hope I'm not coming off as arrogant or cross - I'm trying to say that it's totally up to you.
---
Best part of that is no Mytich, no Heroic, no Normal just Raiding. YES
---
I tried to search but I've had no luck! Do you have a link?
---
not sure whatcha talking about, how is it 'great dps' if you lose to all other dps classes?
---
There is no capital attacks when disonerable  kills arrive :(
---
I will admit that the corpse runs are one of the few things I feel was better in TBC/Wrath. Dying in Un'goro is just fucking agonizing honestly.
---
I dont care about any title or reward, or even the achievement itself. I'm just saying that it will be a lot harder to convince 100 or more people to join a raid on enemy capitals when there's no incentive to do so. I'm sure people will still want to do it, but finding enough of them isnt going to be as easy as it was after the achievement came out.
---
Saved. Thank you.
---
Your not supposed to stun warriors anyways. I mean you can but then your fighting in the open and likely to get hit by some other player and die.
---
Of course you can just tickle the warrior and go.jnto stealth using backstab and crap like that but it ends up taking awhile.
---
Go Subtlety for PvP server leveling. It's better than people think. 
---
Use Big Sword and fast offhand. 
---
Vs a warrior here's how you do it. 
---
1. Pop evasion. 
---
2. Stealth. 
---
3. Shadowstep
---
4. Garrote. 
---
5. Target has 2 combo points (usually). Get third combo point from Evasion ability plus Setup talent. 
---
6. Use Hemo twice. 
---
7. Rupture. 
---
8. Vanish
---
9. Prep.
---
10. Do it again. 
---
Your only in combat for like 6-8 seconds and your dots will hurt a lot. Plus serrated blades scales with level and you've still got poisons available
---
Nice too see someone actually knowing what they are talking about, this was my first thought after they released the pvp timeline. But let them have it their way, hopefully they will realize they fucked at one point or another.
---
We will most likely have the updated version with proper looks, but no confirmation yet.
---
Jesus, how do you get through life blind?
---
People do things like this for fun not because some stupid title or mount tells you to.
---
My thoughts when launch server queue kicks in
---
Just play retail. You can be a achievement collector there.
---
Hey look a rogue player
---
You are toxic as long as i don't see your "Not a Toxic" Achievement.
---
Zinrokh is better and NOT very minor, in a nutshell their swing damage is about the same, but zinrokh got +28 stamina and sword spec.
---
stamina is very valuable for pvp, it also scales with percetage buff like kings or tauren racial and others. i'd take zin'rokh even if it had less damage, but it has more however you count it, so its for sure better, its not even a question.
---
this guy talking about losing dps on white attack is very irrelevent for pvp, its about weapon swing damage not weapon dps.
---
fits thematically.
---
You people are getting the wrong idea. It's not about the title or mount or even the achievement. I'm saying it's going to be harder to get enough people together without those incentives. I would do it regardless, but not everyone would be willing to do that same.
---
Can anybody tell what spec was used?
---
WoW was designed for people who never played WoW before. You'll be fine.
---
I don't remember anything explicit but consider this:
---
Classic is a server option/"freebie" for WoW subscribers. It's part of WoW, not a separate game. WoW already has trial accounts, that won't change. The most likely option is that you won't get any access to Classic unless you subscribe.
---
Quite a while ago an error message with "You can only access this realm with an active subscription." (or something similar) was also datamined, which reinforces this.
---
Have you been playing on any private vanilla see?  It happens all the time.
---
I played for a year on kronos and it never happened that I know of
---
It’s only really relevant to warlocks and warriors. Rogues/hunters/mages rarely have to worry about threat.
---
I played for a year on one and it never happened once that I know of
---
You must be proud of urself
---
The problem is that the game tells you what "achievements" are cool to achieve, rather than you just playing the game and doing what you want.
---
If we have to be absolutely realistic, all of this is *extremely* **subjective**. One person's opinion over another. There is no universal fact that A is better than B and vice versa.
---
So, with that out of the way, the fact that person A prefers Vanilla while person B prefers Retail are both equally acceptable but also equally meaningless for anyone other than person A or B.
---
What I'm trying to say is that we should simply embrace and enjoy that which fully excites us. In my personal case, I'd take Vanilla and just Vanilla. Do I regret spending hundreds, if not thousands of $ on Retail WoW expansions and gametime? Probably not, I still got my fun out of it.
---
But do I *personally* believe Vanilla is the epitome of what an MMO should and is? You damn fucking bet I do.
---
That Judgement armour really does look amazing!
---
And go oom instantly :(
---
http://i65.tinypic.com/2h6ej4n.jpg
---
Yep!
---
Idk about this. All the minmaxers will roll alliance as it's objectively the more powerful choice in vanilla.
---
This post again?
---
theres's so few swords in the game that warriors will be forced to pick up axes instead at most times.
---
Go with honor this summer boys
---
no water for you!
---
I dont see it that way at all. To me its just a record keeping mechanic, to remind you of all the cool shit you did. Itll help you remember that years ago, you and a group of a hundred alliance stormed the horde capital and slayed their war chief. I dont think it takes anything away from the game.
---
They haven't specifically talked about sets, but they are adjusting some extreme items to fit their initial release forms.
---
I doubt they would go as far as to release the T2 sets early like vanilla did as the changes made were done to bring the gear up to date with where it should have been at in the first place.
---
Most of the itemization changes they are planning seem to be to address items that were released or changed later with the intention of giving players a boost into the later raid content.
---
Of course every suggestion of introducing a meme item or a meme vendor referring to this is heresy.
---
#nochangenazi 
---
And about letting one player get it. How would you determine the server?
---
L m a o
---
Thanks for taking the time to write this! Good to know :)
---
What are you gonna do as a lvl 20? You cant play bg's as a free to play user.
---
I think the theory that Classic will be more than 1 month away from 8.2 is very likely.
---
Means they can get at least 2 months sub out of people that want to try both.
---
You're right. Guess I'm just going for the nightsaber epic mount if they include it. Having one mount makes it more special anyway, one of the things I hate about retail WoW is that you have 500 mounts and most of them you never use.
---
/1 Anal [Sinister Strike]
---
Here’s a really long post breaking it down.
---
Results:
---
Warlock main main (will level solo, and casual pvp and raid at end game) I played a warlock in vanilla and miss the 1vX potential/fear madness/killing people who gank me with stuff like soulstone/HS/void sac, and I know I like the play style. Good world pvp. Scales well with pve gear and I’ll have the time to get it, which will feel rewarding. I also know the name I want which will go well with my warlock, and there’s tons of fun stuff I look forward to like doomguard. Plus nostalgia!
---
Warrior 2nd main, will level with friend and also casual pvp and raid.
---
I’ve never tanked and it looks like this will give me a fun pve role as opposed to anther spam-a-button class like warlock,  and I like the idea of leading groups once I know what I’m doing, plus my friend will be playing a healer, and with the time I have, warrior scales well with pve gear which will feel rewarding. Stance dancing looks like fun and I’ve never seriously played a melee class, and will get different pvp than I’m used to.
---
Mage alt, to level after other 2, and maybe do actual ranking pvp with, as well as farming. From looking at videos, mage pvp looked the most fun and I realized I couldn’t pass it up! Very different mobile caster from my lock, and I have a good name for my mage too. Good farming, although warlock was already decent. It’s also nice that mage seems like a class that benefits more from pvp gear, because mage tier sets don’t have great stam, so I could go more for pvp here and pve with my other classes. (Warlocks tier sets&gt;mage tier sets for pvp, and mages benefit more from pvp gear) Not too gear dependent, so I can chill out here if 3 characters becomes too overwhelming. Great world and mass pvp!
---
Process:
---
I generally like ranged dps and care about pvp a lot, but also haven’t experienced vanilla raiding before and will have lots of time. Really care about world and solo pvp (as well as bgs) and getting in some 1vXs from fond memories winning against multiple opponents in vanilla with my warlock. Healing was lowered priority when looking at classes because I had already done my most serious pvp as a resto shaman in wotlk (plus some in bc), will probably play a healer some in BC if it comes out, and the burstiness of vanilla makes it seem like a good time to dps in pvp!
---
-Pally was knocked out because it feels like the most boring and stale and easy class in the game, and I’m going horde anyway. Was the only class I never considered.
---
-Druid seems somewhat fun but I’ll probably make one in BC for pvp and arenas if that becomes a thing, and it seems like they are the weakest vanilla class....when there’s so many I’m interested in, might as well pick something strong. Knocked out very quickly.
---
-Shaman knocked out quickly too, but only because I’ve already experienced it. Shaman healing pvp was my favorite and I loved healing and getting gladiator with my irl buddies in wotlk. Love all the buttons and complexity. But playing a shaman in vanilla would feel odd to me, missing so many spells I loved and depended on, like bloodlust and instant ghost wolf. I wouldn’t feel like I’m playing something new and exciting, nor reliving nostalgia when missing so many important spells. Even though shaman was my first character, I’ll be playing my warlock for nostalgias sake,(they were my 2 60s in vanilla, did almost no end game with either before BC) warlock has the spells I care about in vanilla, and my memorable world pvp from vanilla, and I want the rest of my toons to be newish explorations. Also, my friend will probably be playing a shaman anyway, and I might get to play it some. There’s also some chance I would play shaman in future expansions.
---
Now these classes got a bit more consideration:
---
Priest-If having multiple toons, one healer might be nice. Priest pvp with shields and dispels and silences looks nice and I haven’t experienced it, very different from the no-defensive-dispel shaman play I had. Some overlap with warlock though which is a priority for me, and healing is low enough priority compared to some of my other classes, especially when my friend will probably have a healer for me to try out. Might make one someday if I find I have the time. 
---
Rogue- If I’m going to have multiple toons, stealth seems nice, and they are the meme pvp class for vanilla, and there’s cool stuff they can do with Reagants in vanilla. Although worrying about those reagants might be lame...I think they had fun class quests? But some things dissuade me. I actually barely played a rogue at max level in BC and don’t remember loving it although it didn’t get a real chance. Stunlock/cooldown dependence seem boring in some ways to me, and I guess they aren’t great in bgs. I’ll have to choose between the better race for pvp, or they race I like the looks of, while for the 3 ones I choose they perfectly align, though this isn’t a huge deal. Ultimately warrior seemed to have more going for me to choose as my exploitation into melee, with tanking potential for pve, a great duo with my healer friend, and a pvp experience I hope I will enjoy for a longer time as a mobile melee, non cooldown dependent wrecking ball leading the charge in group play, as opposed to just focusing on the stealth gimmick i might get bored of fast. Might make one someday if I find I have the time.
---
Hunter-actually at first I thought I decided on 4 characters, with hunter being the 4th, but I realized I needed to narrow it down more. I like ranged dps, and hunter seemed like a great class when playing multiple toons. Besides being the best for farming, it can do a lot of fun stuff I won’t experience on other characters, such as certain soloing tactics/solo potential, kiting, etc. However, the pvp videos didn’t really look that great to me and seemed a little robotic. I’m also aware that hunter is great early on, but doesn’t scale as well later. It’s pve rotation looks fun, but not enough to push it over warrior. I wouldn’t choose it as my main pvp class compared to the more fun-looking mage. Nothing special to make it my main over my nostalgia warlock. I would ultimately want to play it early for its strength, but trail off to later characters. This makes it unappealing as an alt to level later, and I rather have my first toons I establish my name with be characters I’ll be predominantly playing later. Pet talents looked fun to me but I realized this was not in vanilla. Ultimately I realized too much of my interest was based off of being strong early and the rhokdelar quest looking intriguing, and that my other interests would have to take priority, and now probably wouldn’t even be my 4th choice, though I was once considering leveling a hunter first.
---
For the 3 classes I choose, my reasons of interest were stated above, and I was able to narrow it down to them by axing out these others! It’s also nice that I’ll be able to experience raid content first with my ranged, easy-to-play class in raids (warlock), where I can learn the fights and enjoy seeing the scale of things....and could then considering taking a more important Role in raids with my warrior, when I’m “progressing” in a different guild on that toon, but with experience. Of course my plans may change, but leveling my warlock solo, my shaman with a friend, and my mage slightly later, I think I’ll be able to explore my options and gauge how much i can manage. 
---
I also like the looks of some of my warlock and warrior tier sets I’ll be getting, but this is just a bonus.
---
Have you ever admitted you we're mistaken about something in your lifetime?
---
Any class in vanilla i beginner friendly to be honest. Priest is also one of the easier ones, imo. 
---
I do have loads of experience healing though.
---
I was actually just going to say that there is just raiding not 3 different difficulties, but then you just keep reading and its just 
---

---
Shammys are worse than pallys, change my mind
---
You forgot to mention that it fosters Hatred between the factions. Hatred is good.
---
it’s okay to be bad at something, especially if you enjoy it. 
---
Priest is actually a good class for beginners because they are pretty good levelers. Don’t let anyone else dictate what you play.
---
I think you can even make a perfectly fine argument for the first pokemon games. I think the only games which age poorly are those with horrid controls/UI. Those games you usually managed to get over the barrier to entry of not knowing what the hell is happening or how you're supposed to do anything simply by sheer determination and, more importantly, the lack of anything better. The first gen pokemon games don't fall under that category, so they've aged perfectly fine as far as I'm concerned.
---
There are still further differences in how well a game ages, of course. It's generally accepted that trying to have a realistic look makes it look bad after a couple of years, but even then I wouldn't say it detracts from the game. It's just that it'll look a bit dumber to anyone not already familiar to the game, compared to another old but heavily stylised game.
---
When I first played in 2005, on my brother's account, I was 12 and wanted to play a NE Hunter. I created a character and went to lvl 10 and then I saw my bro was already a NE Hunter... So I rerolled. 
---
Wanted to play shaman ! But no shaman in the Alliance ?! I was so disappointed. What was the equivalent in the Alliance ? Paladin.
---
I rolled a Dwarf Paladin, and managed to get 60 some weeks before TBC came out. I think I swapped specs like 20 times when leveling, and did 50-60 in holy spec. My bro gave me the BoE mace that sometimes gives an instant spell when you hit, so I wanted to use it.
---
My endgame record was 1 or 2 UBRS, some monoclass Stratholme, and went to MC once. We killed some bosses and stopped at Garr. Before entering the raid, I didn't know what an add on was and the very kind RL that accepted me in taught me how to install Decursive. Spent the night clicking 1 button but that was awesome ! My first raid ever !
---
To anyone who really played the game this was barely an experience, the leveling part really was a long journey but 11-12 yo me enjoyed every bit of time I spent in this game, and really loved Paladin. 
---
 
---
25 yo me don't know if he wants to be a Paladin tho.
---
Same for me. And then she starts talking about clothing. I wish I had time to just think about classic.
---
Corpse camping is fine. Just log off or get on another character. That’s how they spend their time playing WoW.

Wow.... Retail truly does suck, huh? Why would they remove a higher Skill-Cap mechanic from the game? Jesus.
---
You’re playing with bis gear I guess? Damage gets pretty crazy in Naxx. Really only palys can tank any hunters/warriors/rogues at that stage. As a priest you need peels, that’s basically it.
---
I think its the pants and helm of T2 that will be available on release.
---
Play retail. Idiot.
---
DUUUUUUDE......
---
19hrs a day, what a casual
---
It amuses me how jealous and bitter people are about them constantly. Can't wait for next 10 mins vid for the tears to flow.
---
So it's T2 and R14 gear I believe. Don't think there is anything after BWL and ZG in the mix!
---
But That makes sense I guess. I think peeling would be rather hard in the sense that I have been going 60% to zero in a Cold Blood Evis which is another reason I'm struggling because I'm unable to predict the amount of damage people are putting out 😂

Thanks for taking the time to make this, very helpful indeed.
---
I just gave several points questioning the bare judgement of you and other people's decisions, even topped it of with an astute analogy, and ending the post with "Why? I'm sincerely curious", and this post is all you could muster?
---
Are my points regarding PvE servers so *accurate* you can't even think of a single return, and just start calling people shit?
---
I hope we never see a PvE server, ever. [Here's](http://www.nickjr.tv/dora-the-explorer/games/casa-de-dora-new-adventures-1/) a more suitable games for children

I mean they weren't going to really beat anything except a ret pally on the DPS charts, but you don't say no to a battle rez.

Im gonna buy the game, but if I was still a kid without the ability to pay for that, id be making lvl 20 orc rogues that'd be ganking redridge. At least in a private server I had a lot of fun doing that
---
Preists are amazing chain pullers if you wand spec. Can put sw:p on things, wand them down, save all mana for self heals. Move on to the next group of mobs. Easy! Just walking everywhere so pair up with a warrior for an easier experience.
---
harsh but accurate
---
:( I got shit on big time when I made a joke about the "you think you do but you don't" guy.
---
I dunno how to use these things :D how do I change class and stuff?
---
I think achievements would be cool if there was no rewards (as in titles our mounts) and you couldn’t link them. This way people can get best of both worlds.
---
People wondering about the "atmosphere" and "community" that classic is going to have need to look no further than this thread to understand that it won't be what it was.
---
Toxicity isn't created by achievements or, in fact, any game mechanic imaginable. It's created by people who can't disagree with an \*idea\* like adults and resort to pointlessly childish and negative behaviour instead. I don't want achievements either but that doesn't mean I need to act like an entitled brat when I'm expressing that opinion. That's exactly the sort of behaviour that will create a toxic atmosphere anywhere, regardless of Achis, LFRs or anything else.
---
Honestly, look at what you guys have made of this thread, a completely inoffensive, if somewhat misguided, notion met with needless hostility, sarcasm and elitism. A pattern prevalent in far too many threads on this subreddit. Now,  why should anyone expect the behaviour in Classic to be any different?
---
Wastes everyone’s time by leaving to smoke while they’re trying to complete a dungeon
---
Gets kicked
---
“Wow you must be a real knob for wasting people’s times finding a new party member”
---
Oh my. Why did I never do this. NumLock is so annoying, especially on small keyboards which has the numpad in the main keys.  Thank you!
---
To any priests in here, can priests do damage in between healing or is healing needing to be put out all the time?
---
(Dungeons and raids)
---
I think you would benefit from the warrior section of this video. Keep in mind though this is absolute BiS and servers that cannot be named are not 100% accurate https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=boP-NdvY9os
---
Should give you a solid idea for 1v1
---
I recommend finding a supportive guild. Trying to depend on randoms is really rolling the dice.
---
Well ... not everyone.  I would really prefer August/September so I can take some time off for launch.  Already gone on vacation 1st week of July and the rest of July is booked so I can't get it off.  But yeah 99% of people probably would be happy.
---
its not rough, its absolutely mindless and easy. its just slow
---
Why? Because it isnt the way YOU like to play? Noone forces you to play in these brackets. Fights against other twink guilds were insanely fun and i will be coming back specifically for this.
---
My twink had to que for hours for one game after this update
---
Yeah unless you are hunter soloing tribute the only worthwhile farming to do is herbalism and any class can do that..
---
&gt; beeing an asshole 
---
It's an open world faction versus faction roleplaying game. If you can't deal with the idea of lowbies getting smashed by max level players, the PvE servers are over that way -----------&gt;
---
People are so fucking soft these days. Getting your ass handed to you over and over by people who are much higher level than you, much better geared than you or just much better than you is what breeds that desire to improve your character/skills and feeds that burning contempt for the opposite faction which is a big part of the fun and immersiveness of vanilla.
---
I know for a fact that I and everyone I've played video games with over the years NEVER would have gotten so into games if it wasn't for getting griefed by someone in ultima online, getting pk'd in your tomb runs  or destroyed in a pug duel game by a good player in diablo 2, getting spawn camped in an fps, getting fountain dived by a 32-0 faceless void, etc.
---
Getting crushed 20 times in STV by Xsephirothx the undead male rogue in bloodfang is a rite of passage which fuels the community to play the game, fight over resources, massacre unsuspecting raid groups entering BRM, etc. Conflict and frustration and defeat are \*essential\* for the kind of player investment which makes vanilla on a pvp server so great and if people can't handle it, too bad. They can stick to the sims or hello kitty online.
---
See you in STV.
---
once you get vampiric embrace? or touch? i forgot what its called, you can use that and dot mobs for some passive group healing and small damage.   on small pulls you could pribanly just damage with that and mindflay, the passive heals should pretty much cover the tank.  if not just throw him a heal.  for raids i dont think so, its all healing as far as im aware.
---
Pretty much my thoughts... I’m like i get hella downvoted and bitched at for... asking a question I didn’t even make a firm stance on?
---
I honestly only asked because server first achievs appeal to me because i plan on trying to go hard the first 2 weeks if i can get work off.
---
Even if there’s no achievs idc... I’m definitely not an achievement junky.
---
If you were casually levelling and playing, chances are that you also gained a significant amount of rested XP that contributed to easier levelling.  
---
Prepare the poopsock! :)
---
Average if you are going quest to quest and a little hazy (not remembering where things are, having to read the quests, resetting ui w/e) 1-10 is like 2-3 hours also depends where you are starting. Planning on doing night elf war and don’t remember shit lol but if I was human I know that like the back of my hand
---
Pick up starter quest and start levelling.  
---
Everything else, including layout and settings, comes second. They are done on the fly.
---
\&gt;my question was how did you know back in the day?
---
I didn't know. I rolled a mage because I liked mages.
---
Mages definitely do have to worry about threat , you get rolling ignite and it’s a wipe
---
Thank you so much, Josh! I'm getting my party hat out for the next milestone episode, woop woop!
---
5 minutes tops to smoke. How long to replace a party member?
---
Games getting worse and worse is not a subjective feeling, its a fact.
---
The golden age of gaming has ended long ago.
---
Big studios listed on stock exchanges, run by marketing guys not passionate devs dont have the drive and time to develop good games anymore.
---
Just look at titles that have been around over a long time.
---
Final Fantasy VII -&gt; Final Fantasy XIII
---
CounterStrike 1.6 -&gt; CounterStrike Source, GO
---
Diablo II -&gt; Diablo Immortal
---
Command &amp; Conquer -&gt;  Command &amp; Conquer: Rivals
---
Civilization V -&gt; Civilization VI
---
Every Single third part of Valve Games that dont get made because they know they will be worse and they cant create a game that is hype worthy
---
and ofcourse the best example:
---
Unreal Tournament -&gt; Unreal Tournament that stopped development and wont get finished because Fortnite is more important.
---
you see, like many people you make the mistake of assuming hunter is the worst dps class overall of all pure dps classes because thats what happens at AQ and Naxx Content releases.
---
this misses the point that once we reach AQ 80-90% of all preraid and raid content has allready been cleared.
---
now for those 80-90% of content phases hunter dps provides a very different picture.
---
in preraid dungeons hunter holds arguably the top dps spot of all pure dps classes.
---
once we enter the first phase of raid content, hunter is a contender for top raid dps. 
---
actual dps data raid parses for all classes for molten core / Onyxia:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wciSPO9zg&amp;t=
---
for phase 2 of raid content consisting of BWL and ZG, Hunter still is a top choice for dps. again actual dps raid parses:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb34GdHv_Wg&amp;t=
---
and it is only at AQ and Naxx that hunters start to fall back. actual data again:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBSnGwxmOSU&amp;t=2s
---
this is why your claim is disingenious because like a lot of people your missing the point that once hunter falls back dps wise, 80-90% of all instanced content is done and for those 80-90% hunter is a great dps choice while other classes like warlocks need to wait for those 10-20% of content before realy beginning to shine.
---
Really good stuff, thank you for the effort!

Hahaha yeah those charges still stack up fairly quick in vanilla, given everyone's aiming for so much crit and some spells have talent bonuses etc
---
I really really need to get a six demon bag
---
You seem to like the word fuck little keyboard warrior. It shows relative to modern players how bad, in general people were. It was a very easy and common thing to do to bait a trinket out on a useless CD. Happy? You aggressive fuck.
---
Hey man. Is it possible to share your excel sheet? =)
---
Also planning on doing the same, just looked at videos about it and checking the database, but haven't done it on a pserver.
---
Don’t mages have a talent to lose threat? As do rogues and hunters? Which might be his point, idk
---
Just serves to remind me of how long ago I played this. 
---
Honestly even forgot rested XP was a thing
---
You don't need to buy anything, a sub is enough and it's shared (you can play both classic and retail with a single sub).
---
Even on retail you don't need to buy the game anymore, only the last xpac when it's current, when it's not it's given for free to all accounts (inactive as well).
---
I’m (hoping/assuming) there won’t be trial accounts at all due to the amount of exploits to use it for. 
---
(Summon alts, world boss spawn camp alts etc.)
---
Yes, this is the case now definitely. If there was ever some kind of reputation thing, it doesn't matter because it's not the case anymore.
---
We did it reddit!
---
Podcast with Luke, interesting. Thanks.
---
No. Definately don’t want achievements.
---
As one user already pointed out: link achi shit is NOT how people want it.
---
    Neither are toxic in my opinion.
---
Then you haven’t thought it through enough.
---
I can respect that. At least you weren’t disrespectful about it. And i can understand the point being made even if it doesn’t bother me personally
---
You can tell this is from that time, because of “zomg”.
---
This is so fucking cringy.
---
I love it
---
    you can be wussie
---
Interesting way of saying “unlike me, have a, and use your brain”
---
Omfg old memes were the best
---
It's TBC :)
---
Or maybe our definition of toxic is different because i define toxicity as a negative attitude that is only in place because you want to being others down and elevate yourself... or treat someone as a punching bag to displace your own issues.
---
Whereas using something like gear or experience to filter who you invite in order to have a higher chance to succeed as a group is not that in my eyes.
---
No rested XP that way tho?
---
If you login and straight out at least they'll be earning some rested XP while until you get round to playing them
---
Mage friends are nice but don't forget that the water they provide is almost always underleveled, meaning long water breaks....definitely worth keeping a good supply of correct water at all times in case of emergency "Im out of combat but I'm oom and things are coming my way" moments
---
Yes, especially getting into groups will be harder for hunters I guess.
---
You'd be surprised how long it takes to get to level 10. There's a lot of running back and forth. Then at 10 to 15 it goes a lot quicker because you get new spells and gear. Then at level 15-16 and up to 25-26 goes very slow again.
---
&gt;not ~~weeks~~ months later 
---
FTFY
---
I think quests were only a problem at the very beginning of the game before they added a few quest hubs for the later levels.
---
I don't think theres been a time in WoW existence where there have been enough tanks. Luckily there are polls showing that a huge number of people are going warrior....by that I mean a huge number of people will be quiting early on, so we won't have to worry as much about the dps slots being overcrowded.
---
For me, its making sure addons are right.  And the long long long painful grind to 60 with my warrior and rogue trading off rested xp and maybe a priest.  But focusing on my warrior.  My end goal is to dual wield servo arms in av for the lulz.
---
Maybe do your research about the topic before posting your own and being ignorant, this is been heavily debated for months and quite frankly any one that wants authentic classic are sick of these stupid discussions.
---
We dont know how blizzard is going to handle all the itemisation changes but from their plan it's safe to assume they are just going to give is the upgraded versions.
---
As for the models I think there's 0% chance we'll be getting those garbage looking sets, it would be utterly pointless and really lessen how cool t2 actually is.
---
I will definitely be pretty chill when I tank.  I know full well that 90 percent of the people are going to be used to wow zerg style which is fine.  I will reserve yelling for raids=D
---
I wouldnt take those distributions, and the ones from polls on reddit, too serious though.
---
The amount of Casuals is incredibly lower there.
---
I dont think we will see armys of Min Maxing Dwarf Priest running around.
---
Could be that Classic doesnt attract many casuals though who knows.
---
Yea I seem to recall a lot of LFM UBRS 2 heals
---
if you consistently played once a week, with full rested.  It's doubtful you would run out of quests.  Rested XP made a big difference in leveling.
---
Lok'tar ogar
---
You will just have to learn to embrace downranking certain spells.  And befriending your friendly mage and warlock.  And also treat your friendly boomkin nice.
---
Depending on the class too.. you can weapon train at 10 as well and for some classes this is more important than others
---
I’ve scanned all the top and recent posts none talking about this topic and i just joined this subreddit like a week ago so sorry if I didn’t know I’d be putting myself up for target practice for asking for others opinions on something i think is a reasonable topic either way it goes. Being tired of a topic isn’t a good reason to treat others like crap. It’s just the excuse people use to do it.
---
I have a high interest in playing vanilla but I didn’t start til BC. I had to google it to begin with to find out achievs weren’t in the game til wrath. And I assumed it was because they hadn’t thought of it yet because honestly having something like an achievement to shoot for motivates me to do it more. I figured I wasn’t the only one.
---
Listen, I fully agree with what you're saying as I'm also a believer that older games were simply way better given the time period.
---
But the fact is, there'll always be people who enjoy current games, even if we (I) don't like them. Which is why arguing whether a game is good or bad is sort of pointless, as is arguing about anything else, really.
---
Were they in vanilla? Oh, you already answered that...
---
Personally it would lessen the experience if people were "just" doing stuff to platinum the game. A little like tmog, but without the fortnite (skins) aspect.
---
Eh what, where do you get macro from. It just says autoshot.
---
While I could see some beta versions coming out that fast, I could also see them breaking just as fast...I could totally see some modder going "oh this legion system works on classic if I just tell it to work" and then it gets all the numbers wrong like threat being completely off or early quest helpers pulling up legion quests instead of vanilla quests.
---
I'm not sure all that is coming back.. it will not be as big as last time. I think...
---
&gt; I honestly do not remember a single point in the game at which i literally had no zone/quest to do,s omething that is also often mentioned around here. I would also like to point out that I was always a casual player, I think I played around two-three hours a day, often skipping the game entirely for days at a time.
---
As has been mentioned, it sounds like you would have got a lot of rested experience. Which would have helped you along. Also, if you did group dungeons and group quests, that's another way to get a bunch of experience that solo players miss out on.
---
PI is pretty fun to use, but yeah holy/shadow, same shit, you gimp a healer a little bit instead of bringing one spriest. The same way you'd have one mage going deep frost to increase all the other mages dps while gimping him a little bit at the same time. Same idea. Doesn't really matter, though, most guilds will bring the dude who gives the buff no matter the spec, he's not here for his dps/hps he's here to give the buff.
---
10 hours??
---
5x runs @ 3min ea = 15mins (Watch shedo's vid for proof)
---
Droprate = 40% 
---
Pummelers per 15min = 2
---
150min for 20 pummelers
---
Hmm I dont know about that.
---
Paladin vs Priest.
---
One cant run OOM at some gearlevel, the other can.
---
One spams almost exclusively 1 heal, the other has a hot, a shield, a group heal, multiple downranked heals.
---
One is very tanky, the other is very squishy.
---
One is a reactional healer with short cast times, the other has to anticipate and know the encounter.
---
I think it would be fair to say Priest is harder to play.
---
So basically you won't really need achievements because its Vanilla, its not sharded its not cross realmed, you are stuck on that server with every one else, this creates a tight community. If you hit 60 first or one of the first you bet your ass you will be noticed by most people on the server, regardless of any silly participation award. You don't need achievements to be noticed in Vanilla.
---
Seems like you had a lot of rested xp and/or did a lot of dungeon runs? I know for a fact i never run out of quests in vanilla becuase of the amount of dungeons i would run with friends :p
---
I had a lvl 60 dwarf hunter, lvl 53 Prot paladin, lvl 40 feral druid and most other classes around 20-30 before tbc came out... I started before the AQ patch. Some people absolutely hated level in vanilla so sometimes make it sound worse than it actually is. 
---
This time around im going for all classes lvl 60 as my main goal. :)
---
You can still solo scholomance, my man.
---
That's not it at all. It's about making the decision between playing safe and low dps, or going high dps with more risks.
---
I leveled 3 lvl 60's, 2 39 and 1 49 twinks, countless alts and test characters.
---
Every time I made one of the 3 capped characters it was a complete reroll and barely any rested XP was used.
---
I also never had to grind a level, there were always enough quests if you were willing to travel and look for them and two of my capped ones were leveled before Searing Gorge and Silithus changes.
---
First wave will be the powerlevelers. No or extremely limited wpvp as it slows down your progress. When you start approaching the tip of the bell curve, that's when it's going to be a shit show.
---
&gt; I had three 60s
---
&gt; I was always a casual player
---
Sure, there are people that are much more hardcore than that, but you must have had ~24 days /played.
---
How would I view the changes made in 1.12? Can’t seem to google find em, would appreciate the help
---
Druids actually still exist on Classic and can Deal Élysée good dps But have an extrem Hard rotation(incl. Consumables, that druid Head and shapeshifting in Rotation) but See yourself https://youtu.be/O_idQn9Vb1U
---
Which I’m fine with but my point is i was just interested in opinions. Not venomous retorts.
---
No matter what I’m almost certain some third party site will track progress and whatnot somehow. The interest will be there for it so someone out there will attempt to cash in on it like wowprogress, diabloprogress, masteroverwatch and other sites like that have in the past.
---
But something brought into the game made by blizz will always be better imo.
---
I’ll still do well either way because i plan on requesting work off for at least 2 weeks when it launches.
---
I didn’t think of level 10 as a big achievement so I never really calculated it. I do know that I got many toons to level 20 in around 7-8 hours.
---
I appreciate this level of honesty
---
I would say that blacksmithing is likely really good for early game gear as its so hard to get green items outside of dungeons and some quests. Since people are likely to be starting off as if solo for a portion of their time (even if a guild is premade and a guild blacksmith is determined, are they going to want to stunt their leveling by going back to town every time someone dings and wants an upgrade?)
---
It’s not as much about participation awards as it is about competing for said reward. Trying to be first even if u know u probably won’t and being proud when u do get it.
---
I think that's a fair clarification. Thanks!
---
R14 gear shouldn't be easy to get, the system is perfect for such strong items. Catering to the casuals is what ruined this game.
---
&gt;but also hurts other hardcore players
---
You are not hardcore if you aren't going for the r14 grind, lol.
---
Hard to have passion with 100 hour work weeks. The working standards in this industry are absurd m8. If you want creativity and passion back, we need to start there. Not that we can :/
---
Yes, on alliance side. They are at a significant disadvantage on horde because of WF, just like bears are. 
---
If your min-maxing a raid that is. I'm sure most casual guilds will have a cat or two running around.
---
This isn't exactly speed leveling community forum so if you want to post this stuff, at least explain it. Each bar is exp gain per mob and quest completion. You got 5 of them here (1-6).
---
I will swear up and down that this YTMND was a BC thing, and not a vanilla one... but, hell if I know.  Maybe that's just when I saw it for the first time.
---
Ah, my mistake. Anyways, if one searches for this picture in Internet, the earliest one is dated 2007, so it still isn't vanilla.
---
So you're playing Dworc?
---
Blacksmithing does NOT give you better upgrades than equivalent level quests once you factor in the time taken to level it. At best you'll enjoy Shining Silver Breastplate and an early green helm/shoulders. I've personally tried it and as fun as it is it's also a waste of time compared to simply leveling instead if your goal is to get to 60 faster or even more easily.
---
Priest is a great class to start with. Easy to solo level, healing means you'll almost never die once you get the hang of it. Healing dungeons is really easy, too. Only a few select bosses are kind of challenging for healers in the entire first wave of raiding content. 
---
If anything, you might find it a bit too easy/boring if you're used to healing in other MMOs.
---
I was looking into this last night, and it seems they'll be using a modern version instead of the scripted ones we had in vanilla.
---
This was the case in the demo anyway, and makes sense given they are recreating the game while using the modern engine.
---
There were many exploits that could be used with the old scripting and that's why they removed it. One such exploit was warriors being able to charge while in combat.
---
Personally, I loved the scripting capabilities brought in with later expansions such as castsequence.
---
A a few months ago dataminers found wow error 236 in data files:
---
https://i.redd.it/ebgc2yqzdpe01.jpg
---
Access to this realm requires an account with an active subscription or game time.
---
As all existing WoW realms can be accessed without an active subscription, so I believe this error is implemented for Classic realms.
---
Don't worry, you'll not have time to DPS.
---
Ok
---
Some retail peeps can't stand people communicating with each other. They prefer the single player experience where there is no need to see or hear other people.
---
I don't, I have 10 mains.
---
It's singlehandedly the things that makes alliance far superior to horde. 
---
In addition to that you have the human racialswhich are excellent for the melee dps. 
---
30% is not just 30% since the tank has bonus threat regen, and the overaggro range is 110/130%
---
Got to get them to the in first. Starting Zone has none.
---
I recognize you have several questions in your post, but this sounds mostly like a post regarding private server gameplay, so you'll need to try your post over at r/wowservers. Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
What am I looking at?
---
It's only warriors who benefit from it though. And it requires more skill to play at an equal level due to the added AP window 
---
It's not an overall increase if you need 7 shamans to do the same buff one paladin can.
---
5 mans you may get some wand or shadow word pain dps in but you’re there to just heal. You may have a very geared tank where you can sneak in more wand action on trash then normal but for the most part just healing. Raids you’ll be healing the entire time.
---
I was looking at the priest racials and I'm starting to think that Human Priest might be better...still has desperate prayer, but gets Feedback (mana burn anyone that casts spells against you, causing mana and health damage). Yes you are losing Fear Ward...but Fear Ward saves you from Warlocks (once) and other priests only (and they have other options like mindcontrol), whereas Feedback burns any spellcaster you might come across potentially making them go oom if you can drag the fight on.
---
As for normal racials, a boost to spirit is a good boon for a priest (discipline focused at least) and stealth detection might help you against rogues and druids.
---
👍
---
Healing model in WoW differs from FFXIV significantly. You won't be casting any DPS spells, it isn't required. Just wand things if you have nothing to do or try to snipe Spirit Tap by a carefully placed Mind Blast.
---
What you see here is a 5 purple skyscrapers. Each one slightly different from the next. What's truly interesting here is the tendency for each designer to incorporate slopes into their design. One designer included a very large mid-section rooftop garden, but still maintained the sloped design on the floors above.  
---
Truly interesting diagrams here.
---
There has always been just the right amount of tanks. It's just that people play tank/heal/dps ratios based on raids and not dungeons. If you have 1 tank for every 5 players on the server you'd have too many tanks as you really need at most 1/8 in raids. 
---
This is not as much of an issue in vanilla as almost every warrior will be willing to tank dungeons to farm their prebis.
---
In Raids you will usually be pre-casting heals a lot and you don't want to use mana on dmg anyway. 
---
In dungeons it can sometimes be good to cast some damaging spells, but usually preserving your mana is more important. It also means you need less time to drink in between pulls, which can make the run faster. Using your wand is a good idea though, a lot of players don't do it and it adds a decent amount of damage.
---
lol
---
Maybe it's worth to post an update in this subreddit.
---
Get to lvl10. Create my guild.
---
I know you say they're garbage, but back in vanilla when a rogue opened on you and you saw his generic red hood, you were in for some trouble.  
---
Just seeing the generic red hood struck fear into people.
---
30% is 30%. Whether it's 110, 130 or 278. Tank generates 100 tps, you generate 101 tps, you'll pull aggro eventually. With salv you're now generating 70.7 tps and never passing the tank.
---
hunter in rogue body? But yea, wasted slots for sure...couldve just done 1...maybe 2 slots worth of shot and been fine (or maybe 1 shot and 1 arrows just in case you find something later)
---
Spotted the wussie.
---
We already talked about this : instance reset are capped at 5 per hour.
---
So you will still need 10 hours to get your pummelers, even if it's not 10 hours continuous play time.
---
Feral does hunter dps so yes they will beat way more than just ret pally lol.
---
Wow reading this made me hyped again. Thanks. I wish that they would've added those spells that required mulitple spesific caster classes to cast.
---
Oh dear, my eyes!
---
Generic red hood or badass unique bloodfang hood, I think we all know which one is better.
---
Thank you for taking the time to reply.  
---
While this surely isn't a speed leveling community, there might be people here who find the data relevant or are intrigued by the problem space of the effort and would like to collaborate. Votes, hopefully, will tell.  
---
I admit my labelling was lazy. In the future I'll be sure to make my graphs more expressive.
---
Needes the Trolls feet
---
Correct, just look at tank HP, 10k pool was around TBC mid T4-T5 content
---
BoW over BoSanc? Doesn't sound right at all.
---
Yeah you really need all the help you can get to reach lvl 2.5.
---
Good luck with lvl 59 to 60 :D
---
Yeah lol. She still gets up to feed every 2-4 hours in the morning but she's definitely a morning sleeper. Of course that'll change when classic comes out,  naturally.
---
For sure. I’ll pray for you
---
Arguing and voting with your wallet are basically the only thing that helps and isnt pointless.
---
If people wouldnt have absolutely destroyed the Diablo Immortal trailer, the next game would have been even worse because they can get away with it without backlash.
---
There will still be many people who play it, or who watch Star Wars for example, doesnt mean we have to accept that they are ruining the hobby of millions of people.
---
On a higher scale isnt politics just arguing too, I dont know if you would call that pointless.
---
You dont have to have a professional debate about games, one downvote is all it takes.
---
Played perfectly a mage will not get hit a single time against a warrior.
---
LET THE BODDIES HIT THE. .... FLOOOOOOOOOOOOR
---
So I guess my first action will be to right click ignore you then.
---
If you are going for "same same but different" maybe try Warlock to keep a pet around? Being a caster would be a different experience, but it would probably still be nice to have the pet taunt/dps depending on which you have summoned. Also you could finally abuse the Orc pet damage bonus....if thats a thing that people actually pick Orc for....I have no clue...
---
Yeah but has blizzard ever released any of there games at the same exact time as any other game?  I know with wow it's different because.. well it's 2 different versions of wow and the same sub.. but they really don't release anything on top of eachother.
---
If you play on a PVP server you'll have plenty time to lvl dozen of alts while your main is camped during phase 2 :D
---
0/21/30 is entirely reasonable as a PvP spec, so long as you're taking scatter shot over wyvern sting.
---
I remember this.
---
God memes were shit tier back then
---
5-10 minutes? Thats how long it takes if you are allready close. Getting to Deathmines from IF easily takes 20+
---
A diagram of a particular, and widely known, vanilla player's leveling progression computationally extracted from a low-resolution video.
---
I didn't say either one was better.
---
We will see how it goes. It can fail after the tourists or ir can even be next big thing if it gains traction at twitch.
---
I just know my bow hand is sweating and my pet is salivating for some orc booty.
---
Ramstein 24/7 it is
---
so, if i got that right, hunters lose to all pure dps classes in BWL
---
as for MC they lose to warriors, rogues, and are neck-to-neck with mages assuming there won't be spellpower and spellhit items at launch? and even then top dps mages will win over top dps hunters
---
so to summarise, u won't be anywhere near the top in bwl dmg meters, and in mc u will mb get into top 10 'cause u'll lose to all fury wars, rogues and to most top dps mages, and that's somehow good dps? are you kidding me...
---
Underrated comment
---
Glad to hear you are enjoying the game! I wish I could go back and play this again completely fresh and in the blind :) Cant wait for the summer!
---
I can sense in your post that you are a bit worried that if you do nothing in wow, the rest of the group will be thinking that you are slacking off.
---
While all other opinions in the replies were absolutely correct, keep in mind that the majority of the 5 man groups will not expect you to do any dps. In fact they will feel that you are slightly reckless, unless the run is starting to be extra boring and some challenging and/or speed are needed.
---
Yes you can throw a little dps here and there, but you would look more normal standing still doing nothing if no heals are required.
---
I hope this answers your concern.
---
Tank with 143% increase does 500 threat and gets  715 threat in total.
---
Ranged player a without salv but warlock T2 will overaggro at 930 threat, meaning he can deal 1163 some DMG to overaggro at range 
---
Player a gets salv. Now he can deal 1664 before he overaggroes. 
---
1664/1163 = 43%. 
---
30 is not just 30.. 
---
Next time give your proof so I don't have to waste time.
---
&gt;How much offensive magic should I be casting in 5-man content as the group's healer against trash pulls?
---
Nobody expects you to, that's why healing 5-mans in wow has always been very chill. I enjoy it.
---
Tales of the Past series was epic.
---
Things also got easier with new content patches that brought news quests.
---
Originally I was a hunter because being a dwarf with a big gun and a bear just seemed like a superior option. It was my first character and I was horrible at it.  Then later the guy who introduced me to the game rerolled as a Horde druid so I went rogue to sneak around with him and fuck around. The rogue playstyle really spoke to me so I retired the hunter and rogue was my class. Then one day I saw a dude fighting some murlocs with a bunch of weird totems near here, and when he overpulled he just....ran over the top of the water to the other side of the lake, turned into a wolf, and peaced out. I knew then that I had to try this strange and incongruous class. I actually took a break and never got around to playing a shaman until WoD. I had a lot of fun on my Goblin elemental shaman (I'm gonna miss those animations and totems.) and my pandaren Enhancement shaman. I ran a Tauren elesham on a pserver and had a lot of fun, but I mostly played that because I wanted to keep enhancement fresh for me since that's what I decided to main as for classic. A strange, suboptimal spec? This sort of thing speaks to my soul. I haven't decided between Troll for dope 2h animations or Tauren to be a hero shaman tank of legend.

https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.0
---
Clean UI for the time, impressive.
---
Again, 1.12?  Because before then it was pretty shit.
---
7 shamans? How many melees are you running around with?
---
I keep screaming but God won't listen
---
for the hordeee.. although I'm gonna play alliance hahah
---
__As all things should be.__
---
Hi, /u/berginion
---
Literally the best priest since you have fear immunity on a 30 sec cd.
---
It happened all the time back in Vanilla and it was failing 100% of the time :D
---
Wow, usually I get a bunch of down-votes
---
So that's how vanilla female dwarf looked like.
---
Blizzard, you think you don't but you do
---
For sure, and mana pots are critical to bring too. Never know when a little boost will be enough to clear instead of wipe.
---
This time it reflects the reality. 
---
I wanted to roll a PvP server like in Vanilla, but I am frustrated that the experience won't be the same. I've convinced myself while playing a little on private serverers.
---
I am only left with the PvE option. Now my absolute fantasy is to play on an RP PvE server.
---
Fair enough. I was thinking the OP didn't sound like the "speed" type based on their wording, which generally means either forgetting professions exist almost instantly or making sure the professions are closely matched to your level. Either Blacksmithing would be a nice addition in this scenario, possibly making up for any gear you didn't get from quests, or being left to the wayside until they want it at 60 anyways.
---
Tranquil air applies to everyone in the group.
---
What kind of scuffed ass math is this. You could have just said 
---
&gt;1 dps = 1 tps                            
---
&gt;with 30% reduction in tps, 1 dps = 0.7 tps                    
---
&gt;which can also be written as 1.43 dps ~= 1 tps
---
My point is that 30% threat reduction is 30% threat reduction. It has nothing to do with 130 or "increased threat by the tank" which is obviously already taken into consideration when looking at his tps output. 
---
This literally has absolutely nothing to do with 
---
&gt;since the tank has bonus threat regen, and the overaggro range is 110/130%
---
Some items give +AP like [Ashkandi](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19364) (which is obviously a hunter weapon :o ).
---
Is this bonus extended to range AP or will it only boost melee attacks ?
---
While I haven't played a ton of WoW (scattered bits throughout the years) I've always had a rather okay time finding a healer, and then a depressingly long time trying to find a tank. That and my stance on the warriors still stands.
---
I hate it
---
One of my best memories in vanilla was enhancement shaman lvl 28 and going to duskwood to wpvp with friends. Never experienced a 60 enhancement :(
---
It’s irrelevant to point out that fire mage because it’s an outlier and not actually his dps.
---
Is it worth it to level a shammy to 60 for enh?
---
I'm going Warlock because of work/family and FRESH server. I feel like I'll be more self sufficient/better soloer as a lock AND I feel like it being my first 60 will help with overall gold (free mount?) across my Vanilla characters
---
The feels 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yb5CINrC5E
---
&gt;There has always been just the right amount of tanks. It's just that people play tank/heal/dps ratios based on raids and not dungeons. If you have 1 tank for every 5 players on the server you'd have too many tanks as you really need at most 1/8 in raids.
---
I have a feeling that’s going to throw a lot of people for a loop.
---
You’ll enjoy it, I’ve been playing priest for years and it’s one of the most rewarding classes. If you want to improve just take 15-20minutes every couple levels and really look over all your spells. Take note of their mana costs, cast times, ask people if you are not sure what some of the effects or wording means. You’ll quickly pick up on what’s efficient and it will help make you a solid player
---
Addons existed in classic plus you can still find the old classic versions of the addons if you look around enough, so I don’t see why not.
---
No, it's because obviously you will be able to twink a character and it's been discussed time and time again on this subreddit. No one gives a shit about your twink-boner.
---
Can confirm was a prot warrior, health pools in the 10ks still makes the most sense to me
---
"Life Tap:  This spell now benefits from effects which increase your spell damage.   At rank 3 and above, the base amount of health lost and mana gained  will increase by 80% of your bonus spell damage effects.  Talents and  items can further modify those values.  Rank 1 and 2 receive reduced  effect. "
---
Holy shit I would not want to lifetap for 5 minutes before being able to throw another shadowbolt.
---
In general most buffs stack - if there is something withthe same effect it might not stack e.g. power word fortitude and scroll of stamina. MotW not stacking with kings/demon armor whatever is something I've never expierienced and sounds rather buggy to me
---
Great info dawg
---
As i rember right, this was a list of bugs that COULD make Reckoning drop, not allways have.
---
Switching weapons did not drop the stacks all the time (I played with a pala until naxx release and he allways used to do that, i even rember dueling on his acc and switching weapons and then dropping the stacks and be totaly confused).
---
CC did cause it to bug out to sometimes.
---
I think the context of the post was explain some things where reckoning could dropp not should drop.
---
Nah .... preraid bis had around that level - propably even more with raid buffs
---
Has overnuking ever been a thing post vanilla/tbc? I don't remember ever having to hold in dps in cata and beyond.
---
a Dork
---
But there’s no shaman? It’s just saying that hunters are afk autoshooting. Since there’s pally and no sham it’s almost certainly made by a vanilla Alliance player
---
Is there a map without all the names of all places? Just cities and dungeons?
---
I played a holy Priest in classic up until Twin emperors in aq. Never was it in my mind to dps in healing downtimes. 
---
Now in retail wow i Play a resto druid mostly in 5 man content and try to dps as much as possibly in healing downtimes which would otherwise considered as Bad play if i would not try to squeeze in extra dmg. It is just part of the Role.
---
In classic however i do Not remember it that way. But maybe we were just really bad back then:D
---
Spotted the 11yr old
---
No problem
---
&gt; plus you can still find the old ~~classic~~ vanilla versions of the addons if you look around enough, so I don’t see why not.
---
Which wont work in Classic.
---
&lt;grunts in pain while on the toilet, sound of an object dislodging and splashing in the water below&gt; for the alliance!
---
Only Leper gnome meat isn't kosher. They are rightfully considered unclean. Regular gnome meat should be good to depending on how you slaughter the gnome.
---
We're all in our 20s or 30s on this subreddit. Don't have to be young to think that you're a dumbass for thinking that playing "safely" and capping your raid dps is a dumb and anti-fun idea.
---
Naxx doesn’t only drop t3. I was referring to elemental fury, sapphiron’s eye etc. They would also be wearing some t2.5, but bis would include a lot of naxx loot.
---
Yeah downvoting for fucking annoying click bait red arrow.
---
What's the Hunters role in WSG? Can they make a good flag carrier? Better on attack, defence, supporting flag carrier... just jumping people in the middle?
---
Well this is embarrassing. Looking at the Aszhara map, I never noticed there was an area inside the mountain south of the main road...
---
I don't know whats there, and what its for. But now I must explore it come classic. This cannot stand any longer.
---
I always say play what you want to play - it should be a game after all. If you don't want to be a member of the top pvp guilds/premade raids you'll be fine on your own. People using the best possible specs available might take you down here and there but I wouldn't think all of your pvp experience will be just running back to your corpse. There'll be new players, you'll be a part of groups, playing with friends, sometimes even your WF procs at the right time.
---
Pretty much this. All it takes is a bonus 1 or so levels per 10 to make it seem like there is always quests around.
---
That's cool. From my experience, BS really doesn't help pad out gear for warriors short of going seriously out of your way to keep it leveled, so I don't want OP having wrong expectations.
---
That being said, sharpening stones and the mace equivalent aren't bad to have, but I still couldn't justify it outside of taking the profession for the sheer hell of it.
---
&gt;and say "you know what? Fuck it, we are going to make alternative history DLC" that keeps as much of Vanilla "rules" as possible while still making "new" content.
---
I realistically think Classic will end up having a bigger concurrent playerbase for quite some time after launch and leave retail in its shadows. If Blizzard is smart and the financial analysts allow them to, they will most probably start a spinoff expansion series just like you mentioned.
---
However Classic should remain just Classic.
---
The ones you mentioned are supposed to stack. The main ones that don't are like Elixir of Greater Agility and Mongoose for example.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Awesome as usual Frost! Keep them coming!
---
damn, playing a hunter i vanilla gets worse the more i know
---
It absolutely was. They've since made threat a joke but threat meter mods existed for a damn good reason back in the day.
---
I love speedrunning data. I don't know what I'm looking at here.
---
I liked it very good didnt remember half of the mats
---
Yes, because theres just too many things that are so much smarter/simpler/faster/easier/BETTER with addons. Raid frames... timers... HoT/DoT management. Everything is personal preference, as well.
---
This. This so hard.
---
I was playing twink a few months ago and they removed that,you now get grouped with anyone
---
http://endgamewowraidingpart2.ytmnd.com/
---
In terms of questing, no. At least not for my first character to 60.
---
I’m so grateful to the people responsible for this. The regular people who came together to sign that petition and populate Nost. The faces of the community that used their platform to speak to Blizzard. Jontron, Soda, etc. And also the people at Blizzard, current and former, who pushed for this, like Mark Kern, who hand delivered the petition to Blizzard.
---
I can’t believe that wall of no thing ever existed. I’m glad people realize that people just want to *play a damn game*. I’m kind of worried there will be a TBC wall of no. Flying sucks, dailies suck, it will shatter Classic, did I mention flying sucks? Yeah, but we still just want to play the game without using some shitty private server.
---
Ive played a raid healer in both FF14 and WoW. Youll almost never have time to DPS and should almost always be hitting a healing button in WoW. Maybe some downtime in 5 mans or if youre overgeared (which doesnt usually happen while youre leveling) or to regen mana, but nothing more than the occasional DoT/wand.
---
If I really know the fight and have a good feel for my group, Ill drop a DoT into my healing rotation. There are certain classes where standing in melee range to whack in between Global Cooldown is beneficial, but priest is not one of those classes.
---
Support more indie games since they often create things out of passion and it really feels like almost all triple a companies have lost their passion for development
---
Yet here I am trying to make a guide going through STV/ Redridge getting chased and camped by 60s. I swear the worst sound in game is an Orc laughing.
---
You run out of mana killing your first mob. Its a pain. But gets progressively better/faster/funner.
---
Then I’m sure people will specifically remake / fix things for classic.
---
the EU client probably has meters
---
Hunter just looks right with axes. And they probably get last dips on melee weapons anyway. Give em to the hunters!
---
If it takes you 5-6 hours to get to 10, you’re doing it wrong. It should take around 2-2.5 hours
---
/r/2meirl4meirl
---
Getting to level 10 without competition is 2 hours or slightly less if you know what you're doing.
---
I won't touch them and I honestly think they make the game worse. 
---
At this point weakauras can order you a pizza while it tells you exactly where to move your character and what buttons to press if it turns out the kitchen is backed up.
---
Is questing with a friend viable? I've never played but I was under the impression XP is spit 50/50
---
I tend to find keeping your mana up to be more important to keep killing non-stop. Especially when tanking, as long as the healer is doing a good job, BoW means I can pull new packs much quicker as the healer keeps my HP topped up. No BoW means I have to stop to drink much more often.
---
What gear do non raiders have against T3 sets? Is there anything that compares?
---
The big thing would be Level 20 Warlocks for camping and summoning raids to World Bosses. You could be logged in on your trial account(s) while playing your main at the same time.
---
The only way to heal in retail 5 man is to act as a dps and send some offheals towards the tank now and then, otherwise its mindnumbingly boring.
---
It's me, ya boi. Yeah, I signed that petition. I made this possible.
---
Donation button is on the left.
---
Hey! we had a ret pally in Naxx
---
Yep, retail and classic will share the subscription. So you can buy 6+ months of gametime now on retail and have gametime for classic when it comes out this summer.
---
there is another ritual totem that drops from the furlbogs in winterspring,  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=20742](https://classicdb.ch/?item=20742)
---
The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis is progression within a level in percentages. Would adding more labels with discreet steps fix the issue?
---
Not by default
---
In premade groups hunters sit back on defence with a rogue. Traps, flare and the mobility of hunters make them great at guarding the flag.
---
Ammo bag? Looks like going from the left Small black pouch,travelers backpack, Ulda quest bag , black silk bag and standard bag he just has over 2000 throwing knives....for some reason...
---
Context is everything
---
I never used addons in vanilla or any of the expansions, but I like the idea of them for convenience sake. That being said, there are a lot of things we might want for convenience sake but they fall into the “no changes” category. So I’m on the fence about addons. If some of them can give players an unfair advantage over players who aren’t using them, that’s when it becomes a real problem.
---
So one can farm on retail to pay subscription for classic, awesome bfa finnaly has an use.
---
If i farm a little bit on the weekends i can pay 1-2 months out of the year with ingame gold. Thanks shity bfa
---
Dungeons you are not expected to dps, however if people don't die, you are not slowing down the pace by being out mana, and you are sneaking in dps... go for it.  
---
You won't get the chance to do so in raids.  
---
Personally I would only throw a dot and wand.  I want as much mana as possible when the pull dies, to keep the pace as fast as possible.
---
If all he did is level, then no
---
Unless they don't have a beta for it
---
Can just get the best of both worlds.
---
Keep classic servers. Release TBC servers, add the option to copy your char over so you can play either one.
---
It might be a boondoggle for Blizz to support it (along with future expansions in the same way), but it'd give everyone what they want
---
Don’t need a beta for it, can be done post launch.
---
I suppose I've been so immersed in this and, as excited as I was to share some results, I did myself a disservice by not accounting for the bias of my own context in the matter. Definitely something to learn from.
---
Have they acatually confirmed this?
---
Not always. Longer dungeons tend to have a boss that's lower level than some of the later trash.
---
Copying a level 60 character over to the TBC server will just lead to an empty world on the TBC server because no one will be 1-60.
---
yes
---
https://youtu.be/97-oagzamaQ
---
Best for other games?
---
Any pc today can run wow vanilla. You could buy a pc at the 700-900 range for some more years.
---
No! No! Down, boy! DOWN!
---
S-s-sorry.. my dog really wants to eat your post.. it's indistinguishable from a mix of vomit and garbage.
---
Can you link the source? 🙂
---
For what I remember you can't, specially with the big groups of mobs on tunnels
---
its not perfect but its damn good. wish you could remake wow with larger and better areas.
---
Spotted the guy in his 20s or 30s
---
You are correct.
---
I just want to say that I really wish Blizzard had figured out itemization much sooner than they did. It pains me to look at the BIS and pre-BIS lists commonly used and see a bunch of Leather crap for Hunters (and [Fury] Warriors which I'll also be rolling). I don't want to wear stinking leathers like some Rogue!
---
Oh well. At least we get back FD+Drink.
---
I highly recommend Joana's Leveling Guide. It'll really help your leveling out and it includes stuff like this.
---
Had to enable Flash to view it.  Damn, I'm old.  I feel so old.  I'm old, man.  So old.
---
My first guild had a stealth crew that would wreak havoc on Darkshire in our downtime. 
---
The main focus was Blackrock Mountain and pick off stragglers or BRD groups.  A lot of us had rogue alts we would leave in brm and log on them to pk before raid time
---
I tanked BFD as a warlock and it was pretty easy, I used VW aoe taunt to keep aggro off the healer.
---
I could see this working on Gandling if you all know how to avoid his arcane volly.
---
i fuck your mom bitch.
---
Man was hoping this was a different solo vid.  Been looking for over 10 years for a certain lock scholomance solo vid. I'm sure it doesn't even exist anymore ;(
---
Yeah you can do a lot of dungeons without a real tank.
---
Any pc can run it yes, but I don't want to be playing in 10 to 20 fps at best.  I can get an Intel i5 650 @3.2ghz for free from a friend, not sure on the board but no ram hd on it. PSU is very old so maybe get a one. So if I go from there maybe RAM, PSU, graphics.
---
***Has Science Gone Too Far*****?** 
---
*IS THIS IMAGE REAL OR FAKE?*
---
Yeah for sure, but it will be a while.
---
You need to update the stat priority manually.
---
If you read class guides they'll usually say things like 1 mp5 is worth 5 healing, or 10 spirit.
---
In which case you make the stat priority of Mp5 = 10, healing   = 10/5 = 2 and spirit = 10/10 = 1.
---
The gear points will then be ranked based on those stat weightings.
---
That make sense?
---
The beauty of this sheet is it let's you make that decision, rather than going off what everyone says is the best in slot.
---
Meh maybe the low level ones but not Ulda, ZF, Mauradon etc.
---
Lol damn, pure DPS class rivaled by a hybrid
---
We did it in vanilla without the need for any achievement or reward. It was very much about guild and realm pride. My guild raided horde capital cities numerous times, mainly as a challenge to the top horde guilds to come and stop us. And routinely, without fail, those top horde guilds would stop mid-raid to get there and put up a fight. I don't know if today's playerbase will do the same, but I do know that it definitely has been done by many just because it was fun and they wanted to do it.

Don't remember saying anyone Pallys get a free epic mount. Their level 40 mount is free though, and they have a quest chain for the epic one.
---
I've done a lot of WC runs rogue tanking or having a hunter use his pet. It's not ideal but it works. The higher lvl ones are harder, but I guarantee they've all been done tankless before.
---
So one axis is %lvl and the other is 52min something something seconds. Does that mean that the first purple staple hit a %lvl in 1min? What is a %lvl btw? And what happens after 53mins? This is an enigma rolled into a mystery, eaten by a cod and pooped out in the middle of the Atlantic
---
Yeah I’m really torn on that. At the end of the day, any solution will be problematic to some people, but as long as they release the game in spite of that, I’m happy.
---
The issue with copying is the whole mats/gold stacking thing, I’m sure there’s a way around that. The issue with transfers is it actually leaves Classic as a wasteland, as some are worried about. And the issue with making everyone level up is that everybody is a fresh face, nobody is going into TBC as someone with a reputation or history, which is antithetical to the old tight knit community feel.
---
The only way to do it with minimal blowback, is to launch a Fresh server 2-3 years from now, with the clearly stated intention of it turning into a BC server. Giant red letters, THIS SERVER WILL PROGRESS TO THE BC EXPANSION. And if anybody changes their mind and wants to stay in Classic, they can transfer their toon to a permanent Vanilla server before it transitions. 
---
It would mean BC is still 5 years out from today, but I can wait if it means doing things right.
---
I remember them being around 80g in retail.  Crusader was a super investment enchant
---
You get a free lvl 40 mount tho.
---
So imba.
---
For level 10, I'd expect 3-4 hours depending on race/class. I usually measure to level 12, because it's when Horde goes to the Barrens. I did a Tauren Warrior in 3h40m pretty consistently, and a Troll Hunter, sub 3. So, 5-6 hours for level 10 is a huge exaggeration.
---
Did you complete one quest throughout the process? If yes which one was it?
---
in all honesty this is all i did, i never even touched aiding...ubrs was as far as i got. :D
---
i loved leveling and as soon as i hit 60 i pretty much instantly started planning an alt...if having three 60s as a casual player seems impressive then consider that (as mentioned before) i obviously had lots of rested xp plus the characters were hunter, warlock and a druid...if im not mistaken all these classes are considered the easiest to level.
---
This question comes up a lot, and there's no word from Blizzard on minimum or recommended specifications. The best we can guess is the answer we [have in our Q&amp;A](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow) which is that you should aim for BFA minimum/recommended specs. Please try r/buildapcforme or r/buildapc for other tech-related questions.
---
Can we have a classic map with names of areas,  flight path hubs and leveling range? I will use it as cheat sheet wallpaper while I level up.
---
I dont remember using any addons in classic and im pretty minimalist now so i probably wont.
---
If it’s EXACTLY like vanilla, yes. I will get Cartographer when it’s available. Because only having the map full screen and not being able to run / see where you’re going while looking at it is bullshit.
---
Cartographer existed during vanilla, and I used it then too.
---
In classic wow the 5 second rule exsisted which means if you don’t cast for 5s you start regen on mana. This is what you should balance against In a 5 man. Try not to over heal because in leveling dungeons healer mana is the biggest factor on when I pull as a tank. Also you can downrank spells to be more efficient. Healer dps is so bad in mclassic you honestly waste mana trying to dps. Sanding is acceptable if no one needs heals and you want to fish for spirit tap.
---
T3 was a different category all together.
---
This is why I think they should have taken the chance to remake wow from vanilla with the updated graphics/models, some of the systems (e.g. limited transmog) whilst getting rid of others (e.g. sharding/phasing) getting rid of all the stupid shit (e.g. ridiculous mogs, mounts, effects), keeping class identity (homogenization is just the worst).
---
BFA looks looks and feels great but is just 'meh' in every other area
---
The lowest level dungeons 100%, I have done it myself when we couldn't find a tank and decided to just find another dps instead. SFK and up is probably not worth it though, simply just faster and safer to have a tank.
---
I tried to figure out what the graph is supposed to mean based on the title for a while and have concluded it makes 0 sense. I’m even more confused after reading your explanation lol
---
Aka wat
---
Your memory is off. It’s slower if your not rested it’s even slower. There’s several places where grinding before next quest hub will make next zone smoother.
---
Having a label of "time played" or "time" on the horizontal axis would be enough I think.
---
Ytmnd was around prior to wow entirely, so probably both
---
How do I downvote someone twice
---
Thank you for showing your interest in the topic and sharing detailed insight! The picture attached to my post definitely is sub-par with regard to cognitive ergonomy, and your reply should prove to be most valuable in fixing this.
---
Yes, but at L30ish onwards you're really going to need one.
---
This legit 2006, they from khadgar us
---
Wow was a cultural phenomenon the first time.  There wasn't anything mainstream like it.
---
There used to be a video of 5 mages doing ZF. 4/5 were frost spec, so if they got aggro, they'd wait for the mob to get close then ice block.
---
No because we still get the LINK ACHIV OR NO INVITE bullshit
---
Some think they get epic mounts at 40? 😂
---
I think they were able to skip a bunch of it, but they also sometimes had to wait for cooldowns. I wouldn’t be surprised if their untalented stealth was also a problem at times. I only really experienced this from guild chat and my brothers tales later. I used to play a Druid.
---
One thing I remember vividly was them discussing a rotation of who is tanking.
---
No-one will ever be mad at a healer for not doing enough dps in wow. It's simply not a thing.
---
Holy hell I was like "why these names familiar, then I seen guild name. I'm Monag from The Last Guardians, also been with Heroes of TFK and OG TFK.
---
Instant quest text. Hope addons are out ahead of time. Setup addons while attempting to tag boars.
---
I don't see what's wrong here? Dwarf females were always part of the Alliance, never the Horde.
---
you can grind old dungeons and sell everything on ah and still get sub easily
---
I’ve never raided in vanilla or retail outside of LFR, so I’m not sure if I’m going to get into raids. Luckily in vanilla levelling is the majority of the content, so I’m going to play what I consider to be the most fun to level: Druid. Played it in vanilla too so there’s the nostalgia factor.
---
If I have time for alts at some point, I will play hunter and rogue too.
---
Where I live, June is considered the first summer month
---
I fully expect to be ganked, but when you see a ?? with epics come up on you somewhere and they stop and wave and not automatically paste you...it's a worthwhile social experience. It's nice to be reminded that just because someone CAN do something doesn't mean they always will. I remember a few times I've been fighting a quest elite and I turn the camera around and see a gnome mage run behind me and start casting. Welp, I'm dead I think. Nope, he frostbolts the mob and helps me kite and kill it. He gets a wave and a salute and I earn grudging respect for the players of the other faction rather than just blind, boring hated. At 30% hp, fighting an elite, you're basically a free kill for a mage. Instead he chose to do the honorable thing, which is much rarer and such a more interesting gameplay experience. 
---
Basically I think killing grays is a dick move and people can try to dress it up with whatever RP reasons they like, but the truth is: they enjoy the powerful feeling they get when they're shooting fish in a barrel. At least be honest with yourself. People aren't killing lowbies because it benevolently helping the server stay alive or to "help" the other faction create alts. They're doing it because they're power tripping and it feels good to them That's fine. It's a pvp game on a pvp server and when I get ganked I expect it and don't complain about it.  But I hold myself to a higher standard and I'm pleasantly surprised when others do the same, and those kind of interactions add so much to the game.
---
I’ll be teaching in dungeons moon means sheep. Skull dies first then x. Other than that never pull and stay behind me. Most newbs are gonna probably for in fine with me.

raid starts at 21mins have fun watching, all you haters eat my fat sulfuras
---
Should not be able to copy.
---
Go engineering, it's a must have for tanking, and really useful for PvP. PvE DPS you also get your chicken, but that's not a 100% necessity.
---
Why do you want to powerlevel your first toon? The journey is important in classic WoW and you will miss out on a lot of content (like many instances) if you’re only concerned with speed. It’s not like modern wow where endgame is literally the only thing that matter. Try to stop and smell the roses a little!
---
It also is a good weed out mechanic if you have someone that won’t start moving towards dungeon after filling you start wondering if they are worth bringing.
---
\[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]
---
2nd best mount in the game .
---
whats sad is i have to wait till phase 2 to get it. when ill probably have forked up the gold already for a standard epic mount.
---
I like all the dots on the boss
---
In tbc demon armor and motw did not stack iirc
---
Depends, if 1v1 against a mage, I'll usually trinket out of nova and intercept, then I'll skull of impending doom to prevent sheep. If you get a crit Mortal Strike, a Mage is 1shot. If you get a big deep wounds proc, you can usually just run away and watch them die from 40 yards away.
---
40 yards is 36.58 meters
---
Indisputable proof.
---
&gt;5th best DPS class
---
But there's only 5 dps classes.
---
Fury warrior with that wind fury totem...oh boy.
---
Runecloth is easily farmed, arcanite bars are like 10g each max after a while, arthas tears arent worth much and strat holy water can be farmed easily too. So its realisticly only 400g
---
I was actually thinking of going the way of Ryzen earlier since getting a separate GPU would be an option at a later time if needed. Every time I sit down to work up a shopping list for parts it is always a different list.
---
Thanks for the suggestion.
---
A shitpiss.
---
Well you cared enough to comment, so did numerous other people, If i knew the answer to the question I wouldnt have asked. Although now I cant wait to make one so I can kill salty noobs like yourself :D
---
Cool. Out of interest, if I read the data correct then the ”plateu” on lvl 4 is some traveltime somewhere I guess?
---
I'm not sure that's true. How are they going to hit if the warrior uses FAP and keeps running straight for them? Intercept has a 25 yard range, so at most they could get 1 frost bolt before having to go to max range, but if they want to use instant casts, they're inside intercept range. If the Warrior uses Skull of Impending Doom or Nifty Stopwatch, they at least get intercept and 1 white hit (and hopefully a Mortal Strike).
---
No worse than how it was first time round? Plus you'll at least have Belfs and Draenai levelling.
---
Worst DPS out of the non-meme specs but still isn't a meme spec at least :\^)
---
Looking forward to it! Took me forever to figure out a class but I like Shamans.
---
Blessing of protection, yes. Divine protection no.
---
Effective threat / tooltip threat. Are you arguing that the effective threat reduction is 30%, less or more?
---
Fel Dworc
---
I don't remember ever having threat problems post TBC except in the first 1-2 seconds of a pull.
---
You should just wand in 5 mans and maybe try to snipe killing blows with Mind Blast to get Spirit tap talent to proc. If you as a healer go out of mana in a dungeon the whole group has to wait for you get it back and it just makes the dungeon take longer, so focusing on doing as much dps as possible as a healer in dungeons is not encouraged.
---
Nova jump (lol spell batching) the intercept to stay away from melee range and wait out the 1s stun while he sits in the nova. FAP has to be popped before the nova to work so if he FAP+intercept he may get one hit in but you'd just blink sheep to wait it out.
---
If you play perfectly and put him in combat before he can charge, he's completely out of options after the first FAP intercept into blink sheep. Every subsequent intercept can be nova jumped for 0 damage if done perfectly. 
---
I may be slightly exaggerating but not by much.
---
Darnit I wanted to level with mining and engineering, but this video makes me want to lvl herb alch.
---
Yeah I won't be tagging into 19 BGs my man, I'll be too busy playing the actual game at 60 to even notice you.
---
Look at his bottom bar, it says "Bags: 46/60", then add up his bags, he has 4 bags and an ammo pouch.
---
Also people will find some way to game the system if you copy instead of move.  100 people pool gold to 1 player before he copies.  then they hand around 100 players worth of gold on the vanilla realm before each one of them copies over.
---
No matter what system you design people will find a way to abuse it.
---
Just goes to show how dumb you are. Try again. Can't wait to farm retail normies like you haha
---
The beauty of classic is that almost all the mats you can get from the very beginning can earn you some good gold IE: Copper bars sell for a lot, linen, etc. Nowadays not so much because everyone and their mom has a huge supply of it.
---
Druids can tank the shit out of leveling 5 mans. Often better than a warrior.
---
Cringy?  This pic was a classic back in its day
---
It will boost both melee and ranged
---
If your prepared with free action potions and a skull of impending doom along with any number of other helpful trinkets and items you’ll do well in world pvp solo. 
---
Most people you’ll see in the world will suck. If you come up against another Boy Scout packing the same level of consumables and naturally counter you it will be a problem. If that happens you just have to pray to the ring gods that you get some nice crits and finish them off before they break free.
---
I feel you, this is why I don't like pet classes, and hunter even less than lock. I don't like micromanaging a pet. Feels like I have to bark orders to bad AI to stop it from doing dumb shit constantly.
---
Will certainly use DBM and threat/DPS/HPS meters. Auctioneer is also likely.
---
[Here.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw-AsX4JqnULqKdXu2NPAqw)
---
Intercept is a 3 second stun. I just remember back in 2005 targeting Mages specifically because if I got the jump, they were a free kill. I'd usually one shot them if MS was up, so I'd charge, Beserker Stance, white hit, they'd nova, I'd trinket, intercept, mortal strike, and execute spam until they were dead. But yeah, if the mage gets the jump it's a whole heck of a lot harder. The Mage's lack of HP and armor can't be overstated.
---
Greetings,
---
Let me tell you what I did, and hopefully you'll find it helpful. I was saving for Long Boi, and had over 1.5 mil, but it was taking forever. I decided that I've hed enough of retail, and need a break from WoW till Classic launches, so I bought 9 tokens (EU). When you buy a token, you have an option to exchange it for game time, or 13 € of BNet balance. I exchanged it for the  €, so now I have 117€  on my account ready to spend on WoW Classic Deluxe edition, if there is one, and also game time. Hope that helps. Cheers.
---
I signed that petintion back then
---
I used the shit out of add-ons in vanilla, and I will in classic too. My only hope is there is a beta so they can be ready for launch.
---
Forgot the most important one which is that horde are not made forcibly effeminate by having bleves pushed upon them (and without it even making sense story wise). In other words no forced leftism!
---
But level 20 our of 120, is not the same as doing level 20/60.
---
Huh?  I play a huntard and know how to LOS pull.
---
Those people are also the free honor for the ones who are after HK's.
---
Well I will give you some upsides from what I remember (played hunter from open beta through twin emps in vanilla, then all of TBC). 
---
PvP is strong.  World PvP you have the advantage of being faster than most people pre-mount.  Track humanoid.  If you get an aimed shot off to start a fight you are probably going to kill that person.  You are relatively hard to gank (track + you should be full hp due to pet tanking).  In BGs if you are solo queueing you are probably going to feel great, especially in AV.  You have a long range and with good gear you can near instant delete people wearing cloth (aimed, auto,multi).  If you can't delete people just try to viper sting them to oom then watch them flail around until they die.
---
PvE well you get tranq shot and you dont ever have to worry about threat unless FD fails 3-4x in a row.  So you are at least necessary and have an interesting rotation (not spamming fireball/frostbolt 500x in a row).  You should also be able to gear fairly quickly.
---
So yeah you won't be winning DPS meters and your pet is basically there for interrupts after hitting 60, but you will do just fine/good overall.
---
The other blessings are OP too, especially Kings. Fear Ward also nice. Not to mention needing way more shamans in your raid all to do less than half the amount of paladins, forcing horde to use less Priests.
---
It kind of makes sense though, a sort of storytelling powercreep.
---
You were ordinary and did great deeds.  But next expansion you had those great deeds under your belt already before you started more great deeds. 
---
The problem with all the quests you've done being cannon is eventually you can't ignore just how much incredible shit you've accomplished and you really stopped being ordinary.
---
It almost certainly was his point, but he’s still wrong haha.
---
I thought I wanted a Shaman, Paladin or Druid back in the day. I rolled a Horde Mage in Open Beta knowing it’d be wiped and I wanted a different experience. My dumb/young self read in General Chat about Paladins dual-wielding and decided based off that misinformation to be a Paladin. 15 years later, I am still regretting that decision!
---
Ended up being a Resto Druid in TBC because I loved healing so much.
---
Thank you !
---
So you think BfA is shit but haven't actually played it?
---
At least you got to roll for it instead of it going to the "loot council" lol
---
We had a tank Druid in BWL. I was just looking if I still had a screenshot for proof, but sadly he is in none of them :(
---
I swear it’s true! Our main tank was really a fury warrior at heart and switched places with the Druid whenever possible. I remember the Druid stacking equip with tons of armor. He got crit sometimes, but didn’t take much damage from physical attacks otherwise.
---
I almost want to roll tank Druid come classic just to try it.
---
A Predator
---
Anything starting with /run won't work
---
When i'm pulling, they'll shoot skull and it no longer pulls to where I'm waiting. So I have to leave my little corner in order to keep the huntard/healer from dying.
---
Nah, you still get rested xp when not logged out at an inn, just at a much much slower rate.
---
The last time I remember having to watch my threat in a raid was in Cata, though to be fair one of the tanks I was raiding with was really bad.
---
Currently mobs stick to even bad tanks like glue (unless it's Skittish week in M+).
---
Possibly.  I believe I only ever got a threat/dps meter because it was required for guilds I was raiding with.  I might get those again but I doubt any others.
---
What server? I want to join.
---
Warfronts are the shit what you talkin bout?
---
SOUND was apart of the wonder that was classic
---
It's a fantasy game, please don't bring that RL shit in.
---
I remember people discussing politics a lot in WoW growing up. Especially in BC
---
I mean.. You're clearly exaggerating for comedic effect and I get the point but it's 3 short levels where you might have to use a few melee abilities or drink some water and eat food to recover between pulls
---
It is very much viable. It does split your xp, but the sheer difficulty of vanilla makes that a worthy sacrifice. You can kill mobs quicker, tag important quest mobs better, finish quests earlier. Long as you keep killing everything as you walk from quest objective to objective (should do hat anyways) you will have a smooth experience. There are those who swear by it being the optimal way no less, try YouTubing for it.
---
I used the simple stuff; AtlasLoot, Recount and some stuff to move bars around. I think I will only get a hunter auto attack timer this time around.
---
What I am most worried about for Classic is that people will develop some kind of gearscore add-on that will not only be pushed by the upper guilds as mandatory use if you want to complete serious content, but also that it will create some kind of gate keeping which is totally not like the Vanilla mindset (other than inspects on IF bridge). But who knows, maybe I'm just seeing things that aren't going to happen.
---
Lok'tar
---
Also Lok'tar
---
We had one as well, they definitely existed and honestly I think they were fairly common. They just didn't keep up with warriors when it came to threat on the horde side because of WF.
---
Not more popular on horde but when you count allies there will be more locks. So you'll see more locks than shammys in a given battleground both sides considered
---
Now I understand.  :)
---
Teach them that they're not allowed to DPS until after the mob reaches X mark.  
---
Or you don't tank it.  ;)  They do.
---
This is the evidence I needed, thanks!
---
Exalted in just a few months with all factions on your side for the epic mounts? LOL
---
You pay them back?
---
In vanilla, you were able to level up to 20 as a trial account. 
---
Someone answered above that there might not be any trial accounts though, so great!
---
So you beat some bad mages? I don't get your point. Frost mage is the definition of a counter to warriors. They literally have an answer for every single one of your gap closers and then some. Can't one shot anyone if you're perma kited. 
---
Like, intercept into nova jump, if you trinket or have FAP active he blinks into sheep and you're just done. Next gap closer is met by the same answer every single time and only if he fucks up the timing on the nova jump can you even hope to get a melee hit in. Which would be a one shot only if you're super geared and he isn't using ice barrier.
---
I'm legit confused as to why I have to write this out. It's pretty well known that warriors can't do shit to mages.
---
Yes, no, kind of: at 21:47 into the first video in the series, Joana starts running around waking up peons and collecting cactus apples for two quests in the Durotar orc/troll starting area. Those two jumps in progression you see right after the plateau are XP rewards from those two quests.
---
The "staircase" up next is him grinding Vile Familiars for another quest. Even by eyeballing it, one can tell that those two other quests were worth doing: the XP over time was much greater than grinding that same period would have been.
---
I'm playing hunter so I'll need an auto shot timer. 
---
Snowfall keypress. Some kind of map mod for coords.
---
&gt; In the future I'll be sure to make my graphs more expressive.
---
Better labelling on the graph would be nice, but the best thing would have been to actually make a post in the thread telling people what they're looking at and why they might care about it.
---
Never even ate shit, yet claims it doesn't taste good.
---
Gottem!
---
I played a warlock because in Lineage2 I played a phantom summoner and I love caster/summoner classes.
---
I played a priest because I love healing and though it was a close call between druid and priest (though WOTLK and beyond I became a druid main) I chose priest because I thought they were the true healer (PW:S is an instant cast front loaded heal).
---
I've always preferred casters to martial classes and I love healers and summoners regardless of the game.  It seemed pretty natural.
---
Dont forget getting a group for the dungeons.
---
I see an Orf.
---
Hi. Former FFXIV White Mage here. No, you are not going to be expected to deal a significant portion of the group's damage in Classic WoW. 
---
Unlike modern WoW and FFXIV, in vanilla WoW there was much less of an emphasis on clear speed. In the former two games, healers need to dish out as much damage as possible to help the group beat content with a timer. In Classic, you should probably wand or throw out a DoT in the encounters that don't require constant healing (5 man dungeons, especially lower level), but that's really all the damage dealing you will be expected to do.
---
The level 40 mount is 1 gold or 90 silver or something iirc
---
Had a level 19 Rogue tank VC just fine once. I think Gnomer is the first dungeon where the armor and stat difference really starts to catchup to you.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
warlocks also got a free one. Kappa
---
also you wont get into raids if you arent a dwarf priest, just have to be a dwarf priest you know, ret paladins do a decent dps, not the best but decent you know,  and they are good in pvp at least Kappa, prot paladin is a viable spec, restodruids are a good healers, rogues are good at leveling cos they got stealth, you know,  profession are very important while leveling you can craft your own gear, you know. what else? oh yea you need to farm a zillion consumables to do mc. warlocks without highend gear are good at pvp. undergeared shadowpriests MELT FACE.
---
Acti/Blizzard lump ALL WoW subs in the same category. So that doesnt matter for share holders. Plus, WoW in itself is a very, very small percentage of the total revenue for the company as a whole. How it looks to shareholders doesn't matter cause its the same sub.
---
Each phase will be 3-4 months. They could release it at the same time as BfA stuff and it wouldn't really matter. Different dev teams and probably even different server techs/devs.
---
Don’t know about horde side, but skarmtank has a couple of videos about alternative views on tanking high level content and he definitely seems to like Druid tanks for threat. He plays alliance, though.
---
Seen that general consensus is that hunters dps is less than war/rog/mage post bwl, then my questions is why are hunters still the best at farming gold per hour?
---
Don’t know about horde, but skarmtank on YouTube has some high level raiding views on tanking and he really seems to like druids for threat on alliance side.
---
If nothing else has been said always assume 1.12
---
Survival of the fittest
---
Trashmob wandering over to AFK hunters....yup 100% accurate.
---
I can’t count how many times I had to dispatch the offtank to go save a dumbass hunter.
---
Of course but I guess what really matters to most is how popular your class is on your own faction, as that is the factor that really makes difference. Shammys make up like 12-15 %of Horde, whereas locks arent that much.
---
Hell no.
---
Why not? Doesn't take long. Maybe they were discussing dirty jokes or something! Or OP did it at the time of screenshot, not knowing it would be posted 14 years in the future
---
no need to get upset buddy.
---
let me get back to your very first statement which i addressed with my reply:
---
"not sure whatcha talking about, how is it 'great dps' if you lose to all other dps classes?"
---
first of all the data i presented clearly shows that this statement is plain and simple false. full stop.
---
now that we got this out of the way lets get to your other claims.
---
"so, if i got that right, hunters lose to all pure dps classes in BWL"
---
ill just give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you understand how statistics work. so normal distributions, arithmetic means and ranges are not unfamiliar to you.
---
with that assumption you can see that at BWL Hunters are easily able to keep up with mages and warlocks. ill just assume your able to comprehend that an arithmetic mean is different to the top end of a statistical range.
---
"as for MC they lose to warriors, rogues, and are neck-to-neck with mages assuming there won't be spellpower and spellhit items at launch? and even then top dps mages will win over top dps hunters"
---
ah yes the nit picking starts. so while you are sufficiently pleased with the average dps of warriors and rogues beeing higher than for hunters you seem to have a hard time to accept the average dps of hunters beeing above mages and warlocks. thats rather wierd. at this point it seems like your just struggling in face of your initial claim "not sure whatcha talking about, how is it 'great dps' if you lose to all other dps classes?"
---
"so to summarise, u won't be anywhere near the top in bwl dmg meters, and in mc u will mb get into top 10 'cause u'll lose to all fury wars, rogues and to most top dps mages, and that's somehow good dps?"
---
yes absolutely. the data clearly shows that as a hunter up until BWL you will be absolutely fine dps wise and more than able to compete with other dps classes. again let me repeat your initial statement claiming hunter dps is garbage compared to all other dps classes: 
---
"are you kidding me..."
---
no, im content with proving you wrong. thankx.
---
I am going to compare salvation to tranquil air and explain why tranquil air is very rarely used.
---
So firstly shaman totem are limited to party, meaning it can’t go to whoever so unless you have 8 shamans you have to be picky about what party
---
Second shaman totems share an “element” totem. Tranquil air is shared with wind fury, probably the best thing about a shaman as far as concerning Melee tanking and DPS.
---
The only time you might see tranquil air is that if the raid has too many shamans and they put them in the caster group.
---
Should we just close down the sub now?
---
Yeah. Like I said I think they are way more viable on Alliance side. My opinion is that Alliance has the more balanced raid roles overall. Shaman really skews it in vanilla imo.
---
Deadlines - the one dungeon playing WoW won't help you meet.
---
I can't believe you wrote something this retarded and thought it would be good contribution
---
Are you debating with a meme?
---
This is accurate as hell for a mostly empty server. It matches pretty close to what I have gotten for my 1-10 and 1-20 times not using rested xp.
---
Times will be longer for congested zones and if you get distracted from straight leveling of course. Still good info man. Thanks.
---
Yup, someone dies, especially the Tank and your throwing any offensive spells will be severally frowned upon.
---
Oh of course, I was just putting out there the question we can wonder about. I don't think anybody tried to fill their list in the demo. Besides, I have never gotten past 2 ignores (as the scam people get deleted eventually anyways) at a time.
---
you can be arrogant all you want, but it won't change the fact that you're completely delusional about this and that hunters are the worst dps class
---
The problem that I run into a lot is not that there aren't quests there just aren't quests worth doing.  If you're on a pvp server there's some quests that are going to more for personal experience than the character's experience like in STV.  If you can get to STV early you might have a chance to power through it, but if you're on the bubble of players there's no way those quests are worth doing if you're just interested in xp/hr.  So you end up grinding raptors in dwm or something.
---
Even with my own shortcomings considered, you just may not be part of the target audience.
---
What a rip off.
---
For hunter pets, loyalty is CRITICAL. Reason is that the formula for training points is level\*(loyalty-1). So you won't get the full number of training points until your pet's loyalty is up to 6 (Best Friend). And since you spend training points on the pet's abilities such as bite/claw/armor/stamina/etc., your pet's abilities are severely gimped until it's at maximum loyalty. It's for this reason, that you want to keep the same pet with you, switching pet's only if there's an overriding reason (in the opinion of the hunter). Some common reasons for switching pets is finding a new pet with a faster attack speed (useful for caster push back, no actual effect in DPS), useful ability (for instance, only Boars have charge. If you want charge and have a cat, be prepared to change pets), etc. Also pay attention to training your pet. The pet trainers can only teach you growl, armor, stamina, and various resistances. EVERYTHING ELSE, you have to learn on your own out in the wild and then teach to your pet. And just like the abilities that the pet trainer can teach you have different ranks, so too are the abilities you can find out in the wild. Basically, whenever you reach a multiple of 12 in your level, you're likely to find the next rank of an ability available to learn.
---
Mage and aoe level my way
---
Absolutely. My friend plays a tank and will kill me if I dont install a threat meter.
---
"im gona liek toly like pwn u liek"
---
Copper and linen only sell well when everyone is too poor to pay much of anything for them...
---
Fucking 1g??!!!! What do you think I'm MADE OF MONEY or something?!!
---
Well, 3 people were able to down Onyxia in vanilla, so I'm sure the right class makeup properly geared can 5 man UBRS
---
Night elf all the way, see you in ashenvale you stinky orcs
---
Fairly sure the dens have stated they will break any addons that remove/automate key components of game play. IE decursive, weak auras, etc.
---
Bfa is shit, I dont like shit
---
Notice there aren't any dps warriors, because for the majority of vanilla they did crap damage.
---
Ah alright, so you are just another braindead drone.
---
Its kinda amazing I still know that despite not having quested in that area in nearly a decade. Try ask me stuff about any random quest from Cata or onwards, I couldnt tell you shit about it.
---
Not as good as a warlock, very slow to start. Leveled both back in the day and priest wasn't nearly as streamlined of a process being able to chain or pull quickly.
---
Both are great endgame, though, IMO. Leveling a bit slower on the priest.
---
Thanks.
---
Speaking of auctioneer, do u know if tsm will be available? I hadn’t thought of it til just now
---
I've seen some folks 2-man some 5 man dungeons, as well. I'll have to dig up the 3 man onyxia - think it was 3 mages? I forget it's been so long haha!
---
What kinda addons u use while leveling and for endgame?
---
My first character was hunter, but after I started my ret pally never looked back till wrath.
---
Love the class fantasy, having good utility, having basically 3/4 lives with lay on hands, divine shield, heals, etc. Sure the 'waiting for auto attacks' was mostly the thing but using/judging different seals and changing blessings. Was glorious when you smashed someones face in with seal of command proc with both criting.
---
I pvp'd hard got my unstoppable force in AV and maybe like 2/3 other epics before BC started, I did some raiding but I was healing with a ret/holy build, changing gear around and removing debuffs heaps.
---
I'm super super tempted to play hunter or paladin again, but I've decided to try other classes that I didn't really play back then instead.
---
Might end up going full holy paladin this time and mess around with ret pvp when I gather some offspec gear.
---
Drone because I share the same opinion as many? So you are also a drone because you share the opinion of other many?
---
Cata was shit I played cata
---
padaria was shit, played pandaria
---
Wod was shit, played wod
---
Legion was shit, played Legion
---
Bfa is shit, i got fooled enaugh.
---
Yes Im brain dead for being fooled and believing on something gone many years ago.
---
You like bfa? Awesome keep playing as I Will keep saying bfa is absolute dog shit.
---
Nah. For now I want nothing but just classic. In 3+ years, I wouldnt mind them doing Classic+
---
Survivability of pet+kiting+losing aggro through FD
---
I hope this comes back in full force. The weather effects were simply amazing.
---
Im still standing strong on my opinion that Imba is far better than "op". 
---
It just roles of the tongue better.
---
Yeah I didn’t play til end of bc but I remember the inspections on top of org bank b4 invite
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20050220103710/http://www.thottbot.com/?m=28523
---
Yeah i was going hunter too I think.
---
In bfa they reduced tank threat gen from 900% to 350% iirc. This made it so that if a dps went ham it was kinda hard to rip off of them. Nowhere near vanilla ofc, but still dps would have to wait a hot second
---
there was a secret hole up in the caves at the wailing caverns entrance that only gnomes could fit through to get inside
---
It just didn't make sense. So you make a character and at like lvl 1-10 (depending on your race) are told "oh shit, death wing just broke everything, we gotta fix it! Then you fix it until you eventually get to the plaguelands, where the Argent dawn is like" hey we killed the lich king, help us clean up".
---
Then some dudes in Blackrock mountain say "ragnaros is gonna kill you all and we have dragons too!" but you recognize the Blackrock orcs as the mobs you killed at level 2 in Northshore now. You shrug and go to Outland and chill for 10 levels because deathwing and lvl 60 raid plot don't matter anymore, followed by northrend to stop the already-dead lich king.
---
Then you come back and see that deathwing didn't go away, and ragnaros, Onyxia and nefarian are back to take revenge on you for not killing them. You ignore them because killing 20 boars at level 86 gives better gear than raiding old content.
---
You realize WoD and Pandas are next, so you just queue for dungeon finder instead.
---
Then legion comes and you get a quest to go to dalaran over kharazan, but also dalaran is over the broken isles, but also dalaran is still you hearthstone location from back in northrend. You ignore the pop-ups of dudes who keep telling you to come talk because you think they're playing a trick: why do they make me get all of these dumb "artifact weapons" that can no longer be powered up and are going to be thrown away after 2 hours of dungeon finder?
---
Congrats you just made it to BFA, where every piece of loot you get for the rest of your playtime looks the same, isn't special, and gets replaced in 20 minutes.
---
If someone was properly geared they wouldn't be running UBRS...
---
Monkeynews is an excellent player with the best gear available in game. This does absolutely not represent the experience that the majority of players will get.
---
It really depends on your level relative to the dungeon level. With no true tank you can still do it if you’re on the higher end of the level range spectrum.
---
Friend overwhelmingly want to play horde...I want to play Alliance.
---
Here’s to playing horde again!
---
How many levels are slow to start on a priest, when does it pick up?
---
Your gear is your achievements, mate. As it should be.
---
First char i made was mage, got to 44 until multible friends had begun playing and they picked different server. So had to reroll since none of them wanted to level up to 20-30 again, so i capitulated and made a druid on their server which i played until the end of vanilla. Why druid, main reason was to afk in IF as in the different forms, did not dissapoint.
---
Except the blood elves, Draenei, and people who started after it opens
---
2 min. CD though :o
---
No never talked to the guy again.
---
I noted your name down, orc. See you in tarren mill
---
So because you don't like something it makes it shit? And yeah, you are braindead spending the last 10 years paying for a game you don't like.
---
Fuck off.
---
And HunterMM is bellow? What?
---
Got any more drugs?
---
1. Private server
---
2. Probably a short fight. Mana is the issue, not the dps
---
Early Happy B-Day. :)
---
This is the type of post I would expect to see *after* classic comes out and meets expectations, not before.
---
Definitely shaman. Great healers and you always seem to be needing more of them than you have. Their healing output scale really well with gear.
---
Just a few things....
---
This is a private server and its all about min-maxing and it works just like any other private server. In order to get to the top list there you have to deal dmg for 5 minutes so its pretty objective.
---
It is 5 minutes fight. Used runes and mana potions...
---
You’re absolutely right it doesn’t require skill, there really isn’t that much in this game that strictly requires skill. But as in most things of life the more time (practice) you put in typically the better you get. There weren’t many players who put in the time and effort to get higher ranks that just completely sucked. There’s a fair correlation that your statement seems to entirely dismiss.
---
I know it's a joke, but the class mounts are actually so cheap in actuality, that even if you just buy the right skills, and take a passing interest in gathering, as well as selling all your grays. You will have well over the required amount to purchase the mats, and both gold requirements and have a little left over to upgrade your main rotation abilities to max rank. 
---
Arguably the most difficult, and lengthy part is finding a DM &amp; Scholo group as a Ret Paladin.
---
You don't need to learn every rank of an ability. It's OK to skip a rank. In general, you tame a pet that you actually want, and you'll keep that pet as you level. But you'll ALSO purchase a stable slot. Then whenever there's a higher rank of an ability available, you do this process (about to be described in entirely too much detail).
---
1. Put your current pet in the stable.
---
2. Grab a throwaway pet to serve as a tank for any encounters you may have en-route to your destination. As a hunter you NEVER want to be without a pet.
---
3. Travel to where ever the animal is that has the ability you want to learn.
---
4. When you find the desired animal, abandon your throwaway pet, and tame the desired pet.
---
5. Use the desired pet's ability that you want to learn. Pay attention to your chat log to see the notification that you've learned the ability. Just in case you didn't notice the notification (it happens) check your known abilities from time to time. Generally just takes killing a few mobs.
---
6. Travel to the nearest stable master and retrieve your pet.
---
7. Teach your pet the new ability/rank.
---
You can get up to 2 stable slots, and in theory, that means you can have up to 3 pets. But because of how you learn new abilities to teach your pet(s), the reality is that you can only have 2 permanent pets while leveling. I'd recommend either just having 1 stable slot and 1 permanent pet to make things easier. If you want 2 permanent pets and keep their training up to date, get 2 stable slots and be prepared to juggle the pets to keep their levels matching yours. Keeping 2 pets matching your levels is a bit of a pain if you're actively questing while leveling. Reason is that the XP gain needed for the pet is 1/4 of the XP you need for a level. And the pet only gets mob XP, not quest XP. So to level up 2 pets, they need to get (in total) 1/2 of the XP you need for your level. And when actively questing, your mob XP and quest XP are roughly equal so you can see that there's not much margin for error there. When one pet levels, you have to quickly get to a stable and swap pets if you intend on keeping both up to level. Now if you're not questing and instead are simply grinding mobs, you have a lot more leeway in swapping pets since you'll be generating twice the mob XP needed to level both pets. If you do want two permanent pets, I'd recommend deciding what roles you want them for and select them accordingly. For instance PvP/PvE, Single Target PvE/AoE PvE, etc.
---
I'm not sure how the epic set compares to T3 for PvP. I think it doesn't. That's one reason why naxx is the last phase. 
---
Untill naxx I believe epic PvP is the best set for PvP but that's just what I've heard.
---
Fighting more than one mob at a time isn't efficient as a priest. Shadow word pain doesn't deal enough damage to make up for the extra damage taken by having another mob on you.
---
Fireplaces.
---
I'll give it a watch when I get home. I like watching your videos even if I sometimes disagree with things. 
---
I greatly appreciate the time and effort you out into making good quality content.
---
very niec boob
---
So as everyone's saying yeah you aren't even expected to be on the meter. That being said, if you do dps while running dungeons, or pull even close to tank dps and people aren't dying. People will think you are amazing and you'll speed up runs quite a bit. The flip side as some people mentioned, if you are caught oom or dpsing and people are dying you'll get blamed.
---
I don't know much about hunters,but maybe the one who did the best dps there so far isn't actually the best.
---
This is actually completely true, doubly so if they're not shit.
---
im arrogant yet your the one getting upset yet providing nothing to proof your claims.
---
have a nice one. but bring something to underpin your arguments next time.
---
Priests don't tend to do multi-target pulls. The efficient part of leveling with a priest is the lack of downtime. Front-load spells and then wand the mob to death; 5-second rule and spirit tap means very few stops for drinking. Plus the tools to heal/bubble yourself. With a warlock, you can use a pet tank while you DoT and wait for them to die - then life tap/bandage and move on. With a priest, you're just slowly wading through a zone killing mobs one at a time pretty much indefinitely. Not as good as a warlock, but still one of the most efficient.
---
Dungeons are considerably easier with two healers. You can get away with a lot of mistakes and even a suboptimal tank. The two healer setup loves it when the damage is evenly split among the group, so one tank who takes it all might not even be optimal.
---
Now add in natural CC (sheep, trap, voidwalker tanking, seduction etc.) and only a handful of bosses may cause an issue while leveling.
---
In general I would advise anyone to go double healer if possible for an almost guaranteed smooth run. 
---
Like, stay in that ret or feral specc, but be flexible even if you come as dedicated DPS. Be open about off-healing on certain pulls, the lack of damage is almost never the reason for wipes.
---
This is also better done early. Maybe grinding a lvl 4 to 5. Then a 10 to 11. Then 19-20. So on.
---
Not OP, but you have to realize that BFA is the worst state WoW has ever been in.
---
So, as you said, the more spirit you have, the more mana you start to regen after 5 seconds of not casting anything. As a priest or druid, you passively regenerate a small fraction of this even when casting. So, some healers like to maximize the amount of time that you DONT cast, so you get that full 5-second mana regen uptime. 
---
In the meantime, if you want to min-max in a dungeon, you can wand the creatures, help things die faster so you have to heal less. Maybe if you're at 100% mana and you don't want to waste a tick, cast a shadow word pain on a mob or two. Other than that, I'd solely wand when you feel safe, and never cast.
---
In raids, though, damage is so spikey and abrupt, and wand damage is gonna be a drop in the bucket, so you should really just stay focused on healing in raids.
---
I honestly think it’ll surprise us. You’ll have most of the ex-players returning and bringing friends who have never played into the game.
---
why would i be getting upset:D
---
according to the data you provided hunters lose to all pure dps classes in 3 major raids and only win over locks in mc while being neck-to-neck with mages
---
i mean, even an idiot can deduct from that, that they are not great dps, i don't even have to argue my point
---
It was a warrior tank, pally healer, and hunter dps, iirc.
---
Coming patch 8.3: Lightforged Orc
---
Learned not to click from other games before playing wow, but would probably have clicked if i hadnt.
---
Thats so awesome when people see people they used to play with. Now Kith.
---
5 minutes lol
---
There's one hole only they can fit in, but its a sure fire way to piss off an ogre.
---
I leveled a Warrior on a pserver about a year ago and tanked every single leveling-dungeon multiple times and had the most trouble in 3 dungeons which were SFK and ST.
---
In SFK I wiped multiple times with multiple groups on the Ghost Wolves that split into two mini-wolves as they'd just chew through me like butter. The only time we got past them smoothly was when we had a Priest to shackle one and good enough DPS to burst down the other big wolf before he could split.
---
In ST we had a few wipes to some of the bigger pulls when people messed up their CC and when that patrol surprised us from behind on the circular corridor. Also a few wipes due to people overpulling by accident in the Dragonkin room and lastly a few wipes due to Eranikus sleeping me (the tank) resulting in people getting killed one by one while I slept.
---
We actually did one completely wipeless run there, but had pretty much a perfect setup for it CC-wise and a Shaman healer so he was able to use a Grounding Totem to absorb the sleep Eranikus uses.
---
For a pet reference, I'd recommend looking at [Petopia.](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/) Also, the biggest question is what you intend on doing? For instance, if you're focused on PvP, Broken Tooth is a good pet to have due to its attack speed of 1.0 (fastest available). The fast attack speed causes more caster push back for PvP. But Broken Tooth is a rare spawn that camped by a lot of hunters as well as some ... assholes ... who simply kill him to annoy the hunter attempting to tame him. If you're focused on group PvE, a wolf is good for the Furious Howl ability which buffs melee attacks. For solo PvE, pretty much anything will do, but I prefer Boars for their ability to charge. But take the time to examine the Petopia site.
---
Can’t wait until “cringe” goes the way of “zomg”
---
Great answer to the question
---
I'm quitting when TBC launches if they don't keep a classic server. I think there's a wide variety of people who are into the classic vibe, no need to poo-poo anyone's preferences :)
---
Haha! thanks for the writup, what a mess they got themselves into!
---
Quite the opposite.
---
Gnomes have shorter jump height, so you can't get up to certain places like goldshire inn roof or SW bank fountain
---
The stairs of the bank (I think) in Orgrimmar. Now you need to get in Orgrimmar as a gnome ;)
---
I can only speak for the warlock one, but it's even cheaper if you can rope in another lock who has already shelled out for the items (even if you tip them 50g it's saving you like 350g+)
---
“Kyle no stop this isn’t funny liek at all. It’s liek kinda dumb and I’d liek to maybe get my computer back so I can do some real stuff you know.”
---
Did I say BfA is flawless? OP is saying its shit when he hasn't touched it, which is fucking stupid. 
---
On this subreddit though you can't praise BfA, only jerk the flawless masterpiece Vanilla. Bfa bad.
---
PSA: If you are a casual (Like me), make sure to go back to town before logging off for the day. That rested XP does wonders!
---
Only fools can't decide. For the Alliance!!!
---
I don’t think anyone knows what will be available. Not even a PTR yet.
---
I think more people want BC than not, so maybe launch BC as usual but launch a classic-only server alongside it and allow transfers?
---
That's a PS bug. That's WHY people said it was largely pointless to have Mining work differently than herb or skinning, because you could still only get 1 skill point from the node, but thought it was silly that herbalists and skinners didn't have herb/skin the same node multiple times to get all the product.
---
Also...no it doesn't. Only one person can access the inventory of a mining node at a time, no matter how many ore gather's it will produce, everyone else will fail and have to restart their gather (which they can't do while someone is accessing the inventory). And one can, and often does, get all of the ore, unless they simply decide to take one and walk away.
---
Alchemist need greater fire protection potion recipe from ubrs.  I ran it close to 70 times before it dropped for me.  I made a huge amount of money with that potion recipe.  In both MC and BWL they were ised bt most raifing guilds.
---
m8 on this sub u get downvoted for all sorts of weird things, it's annoying
---
mind you you are very wrong about most of these being 'myths'.
---
Not bad. With my current gaming routine I can hit 60 in about a month and a half. As expected.
---
it was the 2.0 patch though so not quite vanilla.
---
It’s all about the trip to get there, not the destination.
---
I definitely remember raiding, but can say that my memories from leveling stand out more.
---
Why not? Quests alone get you to revered, then it’s just a matter of cloth turn ins
---
True
---
As a late-FFXIV player, throw any idea of role similarities between it and Vanilla, completely out of your mind.
---
Where healing is the most difficult role in FFXIV, it's pretty much the literal easiest thing to do in Vanilla (at least in PvE). So much so that you might find yourself falling asleep on the keyboard if you play a Holy Paladin. 
---
For an example, imagine mobs dying at about the same speed as a 4 mentors queuing for Sastasha, with 2 of them being RDMs. The only difference is that you tanks in Vanilla are nowhere nearly designed for mass-pulling in the same extent as you can in FFXIV, particularly in early levels. Dungeon layouts are also much more expansive, and teeming with mobs. So the average clear is a lot slower.
---
So, no. You don't need to do any damage, whatsoever.
---
I don't get it - I just see you selecting a fem dorf warrior?
---
Nah, this image was in fact from vanilla. It didn't have the shaman bit originally.
---
And you've just exemplified type D above. Yes, a cat will have higher DPS over a wolf and this higher DPS is to the hunters credit. But the Furious Howl the wolf gives will increase the DPS of EVERY melee attacker on the boss. In a raid, that's quite a boost for the raid as a whole.
---
I can’t remember which it was but there was a blue post where they mentioned it being the 10man version.  Post wasn’t directly about this and was only mentioning it briefly so I don’t remember sadly.
---
Classic WoW was fairly popular at release, but I can almost guarantee that these servers are going to have a higher population than original release.
---
STV is going to be a blood bath, but hopefully the community comes together and protects lower leveling players.
---
I played horde in vanilla, during BWL blizzard said they were going to address the salv problem for horde.  We just assumed they would make a rockbiter totem that gave a weapon buff similar to WF but gave you crazy increased threat but then they made TA and all the horde were like . . . thanks, I guess?
---
It’s still 4-5 times cheaper than a regular epic mount
---
I'd love to see some stats how now many consumables you had to go through and what gear your using. Planning on taking up Resto shaman again once vanilla rolls around, would be nice to have something to build towards.
---
You might find [this](https://www.engadget.com/2007/09/11/time-requirements-for-hunter-pet-loyalty-gain/) useful.
---
wand spec all the way baby!
---
I think it’s the social aspect that’s different. With gear there’s more of a story and you have a chance to explain yourself and also on top of your gear your reputation and guild is considered. But with achievement linking you cut through all of that. That’s why people do it in retail. It’s quick and easy. It requires no discussion.
---
When you get wand.
---
There’s videos of a hunter soloing most 5-man dungeons, including Dire Maul North. It’s called Hunter Vs World.
---
i think more people need to be aware of this, even as tanks and healers you can still make money.
---
&gt; molting
---
Fucking dying over here
---
There was another test server where everyone had everything and from what I remember there was a combat rogue that pushed 2100 dps for the entire fight. The fact that an elemental shaman is over the combat rogue is weird, I mean there's a reason guilds stack rogues and warriors(warlocks/mages) for Naxx end-game. 
---
Pservers are simply unreliable, the stats are completely off and made up which the Nost dev explained on a podcast. So I'm pretty sure the stats are different from server to server, especially when it comes to these kind of instant 60+best gear pservers which is why we see such a big difference.
---
Basically,I used every consumable that exists 😁
---
For hunters, pet loyalty is critical. It both controls how often you need to feed the pet and how many training points are available to spend on pet abilities. After it reaches maximum loyalty (6, Best Friend), you generally only feed it every few hours (more often if the pet dies).

Spotted the spotter
---
From rfc till pretty much sunken temple we ran a 2 hunter 2 lock priest group.
---
Then mara killed that dream.
---
It works for small mob groups.
---
Well the list of players with their dps might be off because not many ppl test their dps there and I think some rogues can push it over 2k dps, it's about the skill and theoryrafting :)
---
The speed, and simplicity of your leveling will mainly depend on your class, but you're right- people do hyperbolize leveling in Vanilla. If you play even just a few hours daily, you will **absolutely** reach 60 in under 2 months
---
You also have more then enough quests to get you to 60, if you plan a route, sprinkle your leveling with a few dungeon clears and are prepared to travel to and from zones every so often. I cannot tell you how many people skip Loch Modan, Wetlands, and Desolace. It actually confounds me how they got to 60, because I've never actually grinded ever to reach cap.
---
You can pretty much play do nearly everything in Vanilla surprisingly comfortably, even with casual playing; **except** reach R14... that's not gonna happen, even for people who are no-lifing it.
---
You’ll be fine. You’ll never have to worry about finding a group!
---
Just watch some YouTube videos on how to heal and spec for leveling.
---
Yell:”I’m playing classic WoW! Holy shit!”
---
Live to win!
---
So level 5 with the lesser magic wand if you can manage?
---
Is auto-run in 1.12? I don’t remember.
---
I wish I never played wow before , I wanna experience the game as a new player again :( it was the best experience ever
---
Fix my settings and put on some history channel documentaries...those puppies got me in the zone back in the day!
---
Widespread ganking lowbies = Great.
---
Are you masochist or sadist by any chance?
---
Also you have to wait until Dire Maul releases.
---
Druids are probably the best for 5 man raids. Prot warriors have an edge for 40 man raids due to their Tier set, but with a good Druid you can be a main tank.
---
Epic Mounts cost about 700g
---
Paladin mounts are half price. 
---
Its not free, but its damn cheaper than the alternative.
---
i gladly rather do a quest and pay 300g instead of the normal 700g
---
False, Zappyboi is a human  paladin.
---
I think arcanite bars will be more expensive this time around. More people will want them instead of wearing dungeon gear etc.
---
You forgot one.
---
Group jumps to take shortcut. Hunter forgets to dismiss pet before jump. Pet takes the long way and trains many many mobs to the group.
---
IMO they should do a horizontal expansion. More BGs, raids, etc. there’s no reason to increase leveling caps.
---
This shouldn’t happen until 4-5 years down the road though. I think they rushed TBC and barely anyone experienced Naxx before they moved on.
---
You Must Construct Additional Pylons
---
When I joined my friends back in 06 they all told me I’d get a free Level 60 mount so this meme relates to 12 year old me
---
* how to delete someone else's post *
---
That was the price on a 10k average players private server
---
BC destroyed the game for me. Took away server reputation, communities, gear became plentiful, etc.
---
I stopped playing 4 months into TBC.
---
That is only if you are honored/revered and are rank 3, and then it would be 780g
---
Private servers aren’t perfect , yes people back than weren’t as good as people now due to all the information and guides out there for vanilla nowadays but even nostalrius even admitted that they got a lot of things wrong due to the fact that vanilla was so long ago so they had to make some guesses on how some things were back than .
---
No one has ever said you get a free 60 mount. You get a free level 40 mount (training included) and VASTLY cheaper 60 mount (training also included).
---
This isn’t classic
---
Its one of the best ways to make gold as a warlock, sell mount services.
---
Freaking lifetap. Had a warlock in my raid which drove me *bats* using this at the most inappropriate times. Sometimes paid more attention to healing *him* than the tank, which caused Bad Things to happen. Never told me what he was doing, never responded when I'd ask, always got mad when I didn't heal him through him going all the way down to zero health because he's *lifetapping during a spike phase.*
---
I'm still salty.
---
Not all hero's wear capes!
---
Headphone warning
---
Everyone else walked the same path, you can.
---
Summoning can and should be reserved ONLY for emergencies. Having to do a consumable run mid-dungeon. Or being mid-run and someone having to drop (since you've got to hurry or you'll get respawns and pretty much have to redo the dungeon minus boss-loot).
---
Those are acceptable uses of summons.
---
But the rest is potentially dangerous as it breeds laziness. Forgetting to repair your gear, forgetting to restock on consumables, refusing to go and pick up FPs for dungeons/raids you're interested in running.
---
yes, those things happen locks or not, but it does occur much more likely if people get used to such conveniences.
---
ESO has its own faults for not being as popular as WoW Classic. Those faults are not related to the level cap.
---
Blizzard should be able to put their heads together to figure out a horizontal progression.
---
That wand is powerful on every class that can use because of its amazing dmg during 5-10 lvling. From there it's not far for next wand upgrade +wand spec dmg.
---
Triggered boi.
---
Mathematically, it evens out with all the other epic mounts. Because it's not just gold... it's time and time is money in wow. An epic paly mount requires completion of a very long quest chain that takes many hours to compete (need to run 3 instances and do unique things while there). In that same time, most players can farm the gold they'll need too buy there's.
---
Around 30 Gold is the going rate on the one I played on last summer. Cannot say what it was but it was the a server that, for some stupid reason, was split into two servers and attracted new players towards the dead server that had less players because the realm list said it had MORE players.
---
Cannot wait for legit servers. :)
---
You don’t get conc shot until 8 and I think even with auto-retreat-auto you can get 4 shots max before the mob is in your dead zone
---
TIL about people hating error speech. I played TBC through MoP and dipped my toes into WoD and Legion, but I always played with the sound off. I never considered it an issue.
---
Rofl amazing
---
And god bless u/drhodge13 for the headphone warning
---
Don't worry, you'll get it when the server shuts down.
---
Ahh I got you
---
I think 1-10 is terrible but mf-rejuv-bear is REALLY strong. All your mana regens by the time the mob is dead, and usually another rejuv will top up your health as well.
---
Yea ok, but you've got 4 badass races: Brutal orc, brutal trolls, undead, and cow men. (Dwarves are pretty cool too)
---
When you're a skater metal head in high school and all your friends are crust punk, you roll with the Horde.
---
I played in the most recent expansion for like a week and they fucked everything up in Cata.
---
It made me sad revisiting old areas and having no clue what they used to look like. And I got stuck in a trench in the barrens for like 5 mins...frustrating as hell.
---
Agreed. Vanilla has a lot to offer to the 'casual' player who doesn't 24/7 on the game. Plenty of content to do and plenty of alts to level to experience the classes and leveling paths.
---
700? I’m fairly certain it’s 900g.
---
You can't pay for Classic now.
---
Comedic effect? I'm serious though... 4 hours for 3 levels is not that much of a stretch. It could take them an hour and 20 minutes or even longer per level.
---
You can two man farm stuff with a geared warrior as a resto sham. You add so much damage to a warrior and your heals are top notch. I believe you can duo dm e jump runs and make good gold. You could probably also farm dm e lashers using fire nova totem, stoneskin totem, mana spring totem and lightning shield. Works well if your an herb
---
I too was stuck in that trench for a good 5 minutes.
---
This was roughly two years ago before Classic was announced. So when I saw they had ruined all of Silverpine and the Barrens, it left a hole in my heart.
---
To think: I only played because I wanted to see the wall to Gilneas finally opened. But what fun is it when you don't even recognize the wall or the zone anymore?
---
Well you can't pay for Classic now so, yeah.
---
Is this including warlock debuffs? Is there any base nature resistance on these target dummys? I thought two big reasons ele shamans suffered was mana and the fact that warlock curses didn’t boost nature damage/reduce resistance. I’ve dpsed as ele in 5 mans before and have done great though.
---
Paladins tho
---
Yup. As a casual there’s no reason you can’t spend 5 years in the game doing stuff.
---
Get your main to T3 and level up your alts.
---
Realistically, it frustrates me how like 5% of each server had full T3 and Blizzard made the decision to make a new expansion nullifying all that gear. Their reasoning was probably “how are the new players ever going to catch up?” Who cares? Noobs that missed the original release looked up to these players and wanted to do everything to get their gear. Release new content that allows new tier groups or BGs...Just a moronic idea.
---
What’s the point of working my ass off for gear when everything is going to be completely different in a year or so?
---
I can understand and even agree with you there... like I said I'm not pushing for achieves to be in classic... i was just asking... i didn't know so many people are salty to the point that they are just down voting my reasonable responses to spite me lol. But you bring up a good point here about the being able to explain yourself situation.
---
As the guy above said, the servers will shut down.  Not only that though, not everything on private servers is 100% blizz like. To me, there's also always a better "feel" having your characters be on the real, official servers
---
Classic servers should be really well run with proper balancing and bug fixing. Classic (should) be really polished as they have better resources compared to a private server.  There are also a number of factors we don't know yet about the community for classic. It could be a lot bigger for classic. Numbers could be a lot more balanced in certain places. We don't know what official blizzard support could do to the longevity of a server. Classic servers should have much better user accountability, so problem users can be more easily dealt with and there's stricter conduct guidelines.  I dunno, I think there's a whole host of reasons someone might decide 15$ a month is worth it. Especially if they're already used to supporting private server with money somehow.
---
I'm torn.  If there \*is\* a release date, I feel like we deserve to know.  I mean, if they've really been sitting on a date dictated by suits who don't care whether or not the game is ready when it's released, only that it arrives at the right point to shore up 2nd quarter earnings and dovetail with their retail development cycle, then I think they should absolutely let us know.
---
If there is no date, and they really don't know when it's coming out, I don't think they should feel pressured to set one arbitrarily.
---
I want the game to come out when it's ready.  I don't mind waiting for a beta test, I don't mind participating in a beta and logging bugs religiously.  What I would mind is being expected to pay for the privilege of doing their QA testing in a bug filled live release while \*simultaneously\* trying to get to 60 in a game filled bugs.
---
TBC servers will be ghost towns unless Blizzard FORCES everyone off of the Vanilla servers simultaneously like they did in 2006
---
With 5 mages you can just sheep 5 mobs if you’re fighting 6 lol
---
People forget how hard it is to gear a warrior at 60, and that they are absolute balls for months
---
Glad he can do the things he enjoys again but I always wonder how people end up married to people who detest and condemn them for what they enjoy, how could anyone think that would be good idea to commit to someone like that and follow through?
---
All of this is pretty irrelevant, we have raid dps parses for each class which gives the realistic and too end of what's actually possible. None of these are realistic or useful in any way lol
---
I totally agree with people that say to leave Classic like a work of art. You don’t see the Mona Lisa being altered every year, and being overhauled to fit the new specifications of modern art. As crazy as it sounds, Classic is a work of art and should be preserved.
---
Or when you can't afford to buy anything because the economy is completely fucked due to gold sellers
---
Because you should support Blizzard for finally giving us what we want. Imagine the private servers stayed up and everyone kept playing them. Blizzard and the BfA crowd would say “See? They don’t want it after all.”  Classic would shut down and you could forget about Blizzard listening to the community ever again.
---
I dunno I leveled a hunter in vanilla and honestly I don't remember it being that bad. Granted I never made it to 60 because I already had 3 60s, but 1-10? Pretty sure rogues can't even dual wield until 10. That was my main back then and I remember that fucking sucking ass.
---
Right, i forgot that its usually if you are revered its a bit cheaper. I could be totally wrong, i just remember it being cheaper the better your standing with your home town mount vendor.
---
Oh is that common? I have bought gold on legit blizzard servers back in the day.
---
Torn on your videos, sometimes they seem like mega clickbait.  While some have actual content in them.  Hmm.
---
I think with TBC it was more like the planned content which they had but didn't ship with Vanilla. They talked about having Outland as a separate zone at level 60 but was eventually left for TBC. The sudden and immense success of Vanilla must have excited them so much that they went and launched their first expansion soon after.
---
Who the hell would like to praise dogshit?
---
I see, why is it must have for tanking?
---
You DO know how long it takes to farm 500+ gold, right? Bruh
---
Lost it at "My son plays 19 hours a day, what a casual" :D
---
Claim 10 names, run my Alts to bank/mailbox in major cities.   
---
   
---
Ready for fast leveling
---
What bothers me the most about all this is that people are mindlessly down voting things just because they see red instead of actually considering the words that are being written.  
---
People are stuck on this "Link achievement or no invite" side of things... when my post literally mentions that nowhere and honestly i hadn't even thought of that aspect of achievements because i don't even care about it. I said "The server first ones in particular" and it's not like anyone is like "link a server first achievement or no invite" lol  
---
People are such sheep. I fully suspect that this will be down voted too, but honestly i don't Reddit enough to care about my karma... Most of the posts I've made don't even say anything that bad. It's frustrating that people can be so "Toxic" while calling others that same word. It's almost as bad as the political atmosphere here in the US. Pretty lame.
---
I have payed blizzard thousands of dollars. I somehow don’t feel bad about messing around on a private server.
---
There is a discount not sure it goes as low as 700g though. I'll look it up
---
It includes all debuffs that are normally used in raids(no Stormstrike),even the Thunderfury debuff which really helps. But still,around 5-10% of my Lightning bolts get resisted. Another thing that helps dps is searing totem which is affected by warlocks curse and other fire mage's debuffs.
---
As a hunter I will be installing my cat.exe to wiggle my mouse every 2 minutes during a fight to make it appear I’m not AFK.
---
300g and 6x arcanite bars(the rest is basically free or easy to get) isn't THAT bad. Definitely significantly easier to get than 1000g.
---
I think even the solo leveling experience will break them in. Keep in mind the reactions people had just during their brief experiences with the Classic Demo... Countless deaths and realizations that multi-pulling can easily turn fatal.
---
If they haven't learned by the time they get to a dungeon, they probably won't make it at all.
---
Not OP, but I used the question one(don’t remember), and threat meter as a tank. Threat meter was mandatory so I could yell at the warlocks.
---
I can see both sides of the issue.   The experts that freak out if you have to pull 1 extra pack in a dungeon are super annoying.   But then again, I played a healer on a private server and a lot of times the bad play made my life miserable, the dps attacking different targets, no attempt to CC, leaving me with no mana after every pull and then not waiting for me to drink.   In the end i'd just let the dps die to see if maybe they could listen and stop being dumb.     After, all I could think about is some poor healer without as much experience as I had running with the same group and hearing "ooo this healer sucks, kick the healer!" when it's really the dps's fault, which it nearly always is :)
---
Beta males man..
---
People who aren't mentally ill and can understand that things can have positives and negatives
---
Because they love them, I think. The thing is people often try to transform their SO/wife/husband as they like and does not accept that they are just different... instead of just accept that difference. This is a common (and fatal) mistake.
---
Force Reactive Disk turns AoE pulls into a joke. Sapper Charges and Grenades also help with threat.
---
When I was in gnomer the first time, I had no clue. I was like, omg there is no end. And I was hoping someone knows the way out.
---
Well that’s your choice. If you’re unsatisfied with the game you should unsub.
---
Of course,I know that. But many ppl think that shamans can't really dps,this proves they are wrong. That's all 😊
---
10% off for honored, 10% off for PvP rank 3 if I recall correctly. So 810g I think. It's been a while though, maybe there's another 10% off at exalted? I forget.
---
And I have for the last two years
---
As a speed leveler myself and an engineer(we use plots often) this graph is utterly terrible at getting any of its points across
---
I have too. Now they’re listening to us. What’s the problem?
---
For my epic mount I farmed the slime caves for a week straight to sell the pet which went for a few hundred gold at the time.  Also, I was always way jealous that pallys and locks got quests for their mounts.  I helped both classes complete them and those quests are a blast.
---
Sounds about right. But even though my info on pricing is incorrect, it really strengthens the arguement that its not "free" but it is a lot cheaper. Even more so since my memory failed me.
---
Dungeons are a fun but not efficient way to level. Questing and grinding provide much higher xp/hour. Dungeons can be worth doing once if they have enough quests, and picking up gear makes questing much faster. Id recommend duo questing with your friend if you are looking for fast. Warriors (fury) partnered with a class that can heal speed up leveling a lot
---
I’m not sure. Do you have a problem?
---
Nope
---
....
---
the dps gain of all melee in ur group is a bit lower than the dps gain of a cat on a boss with high uptime for ur pet. if u dont understand this stick to wolves or do the research before u trash talk.
---
Bad warlocks spend all their mana and then life tap all the way up again. And then die to random raid damage. 
---
Funny thing is that on many bosses the healers compete for sniping the warlocks' health for the meters because there's so little raid damage in MC/BWL.
---
Pros of horde in classic: Every race actually looks very different. On Alliance you have humans, taller and purple humans, short humans, and really short humans. 
---
Pros of Alliance in classic: Paladins&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Shaman and their cities and zones actually look good.
---
I mean, I see that it's bigger; I know it is, and yet Ashenvale still feels longer to run from end-to-end than The Barrens.
---
In short your a star bet is questing and grinding while throwing in each dungeons once when you have all the quests. Dungeons are great xo with a few quests thrown in.
---
You rang?
---
So if your pet has rank 3 claw, you cannot teach it rank 5 claw, correct?
---
Running dungeons is a lot more fun than grinding gold though.
---
If you think bfa is good, you're braindead
---
Weeks if not months. I'd say the average paly begging people to help him with his mount quest might have the same issue. 
---
The other thing I thought of is leveling a paladin is fairly tedious and slow and that also makes a difference in the end since you really only start making good amounts of gold when you hit 60. I'd be curious to see how it all works out practically when the servers are live.
---
Would you recommend doing green quests over just grinding yellow and orange mobs?
---
RFK is 30, and RFD is 40
---
Lol what?
---
Embarrassing
---
Classic won't have Kul'Tirans
---
Well your problem is you're playing ret
---
Unfortunately some of that stuff might not be possible on classic.
---
They’re super buggy. It’s painful at times.
---
I mean, they aren't really wrong. Elemental shamans can't dps in raids because they cannot keep up with the mana, simple as that. Enhance shaman dps is also poop compared to a rogue, mage, or warrior. These aren't really debatable, the numbers have been done
---
No, it's a common thing to say pallies get a "free epic mount" even though they don't.
---
I can never remember which is which
---
Ahh like how I killed someone in a duel yesterday 😂😂😂
---
EL OH EL
---
My point was he's saying time is money and the quests take time to complete... they don't take as much time as it does for any other class to farm the gold needed for their mounts lol
---
we're not 12 anymore. I don't think anyone is going to get excited about camping lowbies unless you're mentally ill.  
---
Good players will be in plaguelands world pvp
---
This trollbait is actually terrible.
---
Oh I was agreeing with you buddy.
---
lmao imagine being this delusional
---
Id definitely stick arms and with a healer comp youre completely fine with yellow q’s. You only have to go deep greens if you dual wield fury meme (which has insane misrate along with missing big whirlwinds, overpower crits, and ms)
---
Not at all.. they sell well when everyone's too rich to bother farming them.
---
It won't be as fast. If you're REALLY good, and you're tanking and your friend is healing, so you're only depending on the DPS to do their job and not be idiots, then maybe you can get it close. I think that overall the perception that dungeons are terrible for levelling is mainly due to how much can go wrong. Like, you're way more likely to wipe once or twice in a dungeon and have to do a long corpse run than you are out in the world. But I think eventually one day the playerbase might get good enough that dungeons serve as a viable alternative, if you can efficiently get to them with a group. That's the other thing with dungeons is it can be time consuming to find a group for them. As a warrior and shaman you'll have a slightly easier time with that than others, since any class can DPS. So overall, it's safe to say that it'll take you longer than questing, but if that's what you want to do it can still be fun. 
---
With all of that said though, you miss out on a lot of the fun by not questing. 
---
Also at 60 you'll have a blast doing dungeons with your friend to gear up.
---
You always quest over grind when available assuming you know how to quest and what you're doing. Grinding is done while traveling and to make up exp needed between quests
---
Did someone say 60 boost? Keep that crap where it belongs.
---
6 months for phase 1? That's 1-2 months longer than back in the original game, considering that Dire Maul (1.3) was released in March 2005, PvP (1.4) was released in April 2005.  Also, with your plan, phase 3 would be released at least 10-11 months after the game is released, whereas it was released within around 7 months back in the day (BGs came in June, BWL in July). It seems a bit too long to me.
---
Usually when grinding you want to be killing enemies within 1 level of you. Green quests are fine, but you usually want to do yellow quests
---
Ill be doing pvp in all brackets :P
---
I finally understood the karma system on reddit.
---
Can't get the damn things to work on a mac.
---
Look forward to seeing you in WSG :D
---
Pvping as a warrior.

Clicking for stance dancing and weapon dancing isnt effecient or effective for me.

Classic wow is a server option for retail, it’s not a separate game. You won’t need to buy the game, only the subscription.
---
This is not something to worry about.
---
bfa bad
---
One thing I remember is the Dwarven bunkers, only Gnomes and Dwarves could fit through the windows, the bunkers in AV are actually modified to have much larger windows so all classes could fit
---
Not if they do it in a pyramide scheme with 1 TBC server for every 5 Vanilla. And maybe one Wrath server for every 2 TBC. simply gauge the remaining interest.
---
Cool guide! I remember originally playing this with my college buddies and at the end we thought there was some trick to opening that final door, we all touched the 4 torches at the same time in unison thinking it would work and it spawned all the adds at once, the next evening we got it right and felt so satisfying to fully clear that place for the first time.
---
I'm talking about Deluxe version with bonus digital content. I'm sure they'll have one.
---
The pvp aspect alone in classic wow will be worth it! I can't wait to hear my name all over the internet for ganking the retail playerbase :)
---
Yes please
---
WoW &gt; Nookie
---
&gt;September release would kill the ~~hype~~profits
---
They want Q3 and Q4 to finish out strong for shareholders. How else to destroy expectations by having possibly 2+ million subs?
---
nope it's completely free. You literally just talk that guy who gives you most of your 20+ paladin quests (or all pre 50 ones if you're human) and he's like here's a mount.
---
It was only added to the trainer for 1g around late TBC or Wrath.
---
I verified my email, reset my password just so I could comment: thanks for the cringe!
---
Are there any differences between the factions that actually matter? Like what content is restricted (not necessarily early stuff, because that's probably not as important) that should be understood before choosing. Most people I remember chose because of friends, or "this one is more cool / cooler people", but never got to enough endgame to know what mattered in terms of faction restriction.
---
Labelling the axis would help a bunch for sure. I look at data all day, but if you're not telling us what the data visualization we're looking at is we're not going to be able to interpret it.
---
Oh man. Good point. Am I going to go back to dual subs again? Wew
---
This is obviously just my opinion.
---
1. If you have friends who are going to be playing, coordinate with them so that Day 1 you are on the same faction and servers. The most fun I ever had in WoW was duo-leveling with a friend.
---
2. I highly recommend going PVP. It's a matter of taste (and it can be frustrating if you get a pair of filthy nelfs camping your corpse in Stranglethorn), but I've played both and PVE realms are both boring and sad. There's nothing more disheartening than questing in Elwynn Forest (it's embarrassing to admit, but I suited up as Alliance for my then wife) and someone in chat says, "horde 60s in goldshire" and someone else responds, "r they flagged 4 pvp?" That is a question that should have to be never be asked. Whether you are "kill on sight" or "/wave and keep questing" there should always be that element of danger when you see the opposing factions. But if you're really into RP or just want to concentrate on questing, go PVE.
---
3. Don't get lured in by trying to level a bunch of alts, but since you're new to the game, try one of each class/race/starting area for a few levels. So, for example, you might have a Human Paladin, a Night Elf Hunter, a Dwarf Priest, and a Gnome Warlock on your Alliance server. On your Horde server, you might have an Orc Shaman, Undead Mage, Tauren Druid, Tauren Warrior, and a Troll Rogue. You can't really say for sure if a class speaks to you (especially tanking and healing) until you've played your part in a 5 man instance, but by level 10 (or sooner), you should have a feel for which class really speaks to you personally.
---
4. Gold can be an issue, so don't waste a bunch of time or money at the AH. Go there to sell, not buy. Quest for what you need.
---
5. Level up your professions as you go. At the very least, get two gathering professions (like skinning and herbalism) and first aid. But if you enjoy fishing, cooking, or you want a crafting skill, do those. If you want to If you want to blow off some steam at the end of the day, you could do worse than playing a low level Tauren druid in Mulgore- leisurely questing, skinning plainstriders, making yourself some armor, and cooking up some freshly caught fish.
---
6. Don't be afraid to ask for help. There are people who will be dicks, but there are more people who will be glad to stop what they are doing and give you some advice or even join you for a bit. My first toon was a Tauren warrior. I was utterly clueless and arrived at the Crossroads with the most miserable and inadequate gear. Another player saw the condition I was in, stopped me, and made a new set of armor for me, free of charge.
---
7. If you don't know what to do, do your green quests first. If a quest goes gray do it anyway, because it might lead to another quest.  Look everywhere for quest givers. Make sure you've been in every room of every building, tower, pit, balloon. Everywhere. I cannot emphasize this enough- **look everywhere.**
---
8. Try the battlegrounds.
---
9. Don't waste your time with guilds unless they actually do something besides jibber-jabber in guild chat- unless it is explicitly a casual, social guild. When you get to 60, go looking for a guild that is already full of 60s and is doing things or seriously preparing to do things. Join a guild that has standards and expects things of you.
---
10. Don't do anything that isn't fun, including playing the game itself. Don't let it suck up or ruin your life. If nothing else, get up, bathe, change your clothes, and go outside everyday.
---
Good luck. :-)
---
Herb and alchemy was always useful if you plan on wpvp or raiding.
---
Using healing potions was always mandatory with the healers were distracted, and selling mats kept me from bankruptcy.
---
Free MOUNT. They said.
---
the epic mount didn't even exist till a later patch.
---
Epic is never mentioned ANYWHERE by anyone, unless they're a moron or deliberately trying to troll someone.
---
I haven't! I would love to be an elemental shaman for the fantasy, but I also want to be taken to raids. Likely I will roll mage or lock since my playtime probably will be 20 hours or less each week.
---
Lol let's hope not for you. I would like a date soon so I can put in vacation!
---
Still better than retail. ;) Pun intended.
---
Got to agree with the majority of the comments here. In Vanilla healers healed that its. If a healer has to do damage to kill a pack of mobs or boss then the problem is the DPS not the healer.
---
&gt;I honestly do not remember a single point in the game at which i literally had no zone/quest to do
---
You're absolutely right about this point. I levelled a human mage to 60 and a tauren druid to 60, for neither of them did I ever run out of quests. That point for sure is super overblown. 
---
With that said, the journey to 60 is quite a long one. Took a few months for me with each of those characters.
---
It's actually free. You just talk to a guy and turn in the quest.
---
Lock main here, it's also relevant that your mount spell can be counterspelled/spell-locked/etc and you'll be locked out of your holy/shadow tree for 5 seconds. Personally I still stick with the spell, you only really notice the 5-second-rule if you're really looking for it.
---
Ret paladins are excellent for 5man groups. I dont know why people are so opposed to them. In fact any hybrid is always better for 5man than a pure class just because you wont have 4-5 resto shamans/holypaladins providing all the buffs like you do in a raid.
---
Wanna see what a Gnoren looks like
---
This was the quest chain for the epic one. And you had to go through some bullshit to get it on top of paying for it.
---
800g with honored+rank3. Still quite a lot more expensive than the class mounts.
---
I don't know anyone who had 300g as soon as they hit 60. Nor the gear to do DM &amp; Scholo for at least a few weeks.
---
You every play Vanilla?
---
Short version: You can use X cats and gives X hunters a little bit more dps
---
or you use X wolves and increase your raids dps by 27-40 per wolf 
---
a cat is a little bit better than a wolf for a sim monkey. it increases your dps a little bit
---
a wolf gives +4.5 to +5 dps to every target it buffs. So on a regular melee group with you standing close to the melee you buff 6 targets every 10 seconds for a total of +27 to +30 raid dps. A cat doesn't get anywhere near to that. 
---
On a full hunter group you have 10 targets available (as the pets also buff each other). While you have some overlapping there - even if you try to min max the rotation - mainly due to the slow attack speed of the hunter's auto shot swings. You get an average of +40 raid dps out of that - per wolf
---
We can't stop at Classic! TBC and WOTLK servers are next! Bring back the best versions of the best MMORPG ever made.
---
Naw man. Hardcore usually refers to raiders. If he just levelled up a few characters and didn't raid, that's not "hardcore" by most people's definitions. You're right that he would've had around 24 days played, but over the course of a couple years that's not too crazy. Heh, one buddy of mine legit hit a year /played pretty early on in TBC (poor bastard was waaay too into it).
---
We've both played a ton of wow including vanilla, so we are experts at both. We had just planned on carrying DPS classes through dungeons.
---
All the quests and stuff we've seen many times.
---
Yeah. With 1.12 talents and itemization, priests are not hard to level. They're basically average- any class that is a "good" leveler is better than a priest : druid (sustain, movement speed), hunter and lock (pet classes with high sustain), and mages (portals to get to quest hubs)
---
Not really a good point, because doing the quest chain will also earn you gold from just playing the game and getting drops in the dungeons you need to complete. Farming gold for regular epicmount means any gold you farm will be put towards that mount.
---
So in reality your logic dont hold up.
---
I’d like to see them take an osrs approach to classic and just start creating original content for classic
---
Did you not see the other items required? Hint, they're NOT free. Let's take a look at what's required:
---
There's a total of 10 quests, those quests include running Dire Maul, Stratholme, and Scholomance. Overall, then gold and items you need to collect are:
---
350 Gold
---
40 Runecloth
---
6 Arcanite Bars
---
10 Arthas's Tears
---
5 Stratholme Holy Water
---
1 Azerothian Diamond
---
1 Prestine Black Diamond
---
The Runecloth should be pretty easy given all the instance runs you're doing. Just don't sell it. The Arcanite Bars require Alchemy and mining to produce. The transmute had a 1 day cooldown in Vanilla. Typical price was 15 to 20 gold per bar. So call it 90 to 120 gold. The Holy Water is BoP, so grab it while running Stratholme. The Azerothian Diamond is a fairly rare item to get. It's quite likely you'll have to purchase it from the AH. And guess what? THAT TAKES GOLD. The Black Diamond? Call it 3 to 5 full clears of a high level instance (Scholomance, Stratholme, Dire Maul North/West), or save some time and buy from the AH for yes, more gold. Overall, the total cost for the Paladin Epic mount is just about equal to the other classes epic mounts if you consider the actual gold spent plus the opportunity cost of the time spent (that could have been spent acquiring gold, but instead was spent gathering materials and running instances).
---
bfa good
---
&gt;I’m also a father now and I wouldn’t be able to keep us with my friends
---
Come play with us. It’s a big group of dads that only have maybe 2-3 hours to game a night.
---
Good thing it's Vanilla, and a 5-man at that, which means you can just put on +int gear and heal.
---
People suck at math.
---
Honored and Rank 3 each give 10% discount.
---
The base cost is 1000g.
---
1000g with 20% discount is 800g.
---
Yep, and this is coming from someone who has actually played it
---
Not really, the only thing to worry about is getting CSd by a mage, which actually pretty devastating to start a fight with no spells as a Paladin and no Shadow spells as a Warlock
---
Don't, Alchemy doesn't make any money until you're level 60 and have some good recipes.
---
Any popular pserver will be plagued with gold sellers. Hard to stop them when accounts are free to make.
---
And some even claim that admins sell gold themselves
---
you still get the different attack speeds. but all the other benefits that were normalized with 1.9 won't be in the game (lupos, arthorious massive health pool, wind serpents from the sunken temple won't be immune to fear, frostwolves won't have epic mount runspeed - that sort of stuff
---
Yes I did and I have been playing private servers since the original E lysium launch
---
It was the blue post about loot trading. Reference the fact it was technically a raid group, but loot trading wouldn't apply as loot trading is only implemented to raids with lockouts.
---
The difference is, Blizzard wasn’t making the gold and duping accounts.
---
I wouldn't call healing the easiest role in Vanilla, but I agree with the rest of your post.
---
The difference between a good healer and a bad healer is how adaptable you are to your circumstances.
---
That means being ready to (as a priest for example, because that's the class the op is playing) mind soothe the closest unit in a separate mob if you venture to close to it during a pull, or if a fleeing mob is running toward that pack.
---
That means knowing when to use your AoE fear to prevent a wipe without chain pulling more packs.
---
Or knowing when it's more efficient to use Prayer of Healing rather than individually healing each party member.
---
Or knowing that if you're oom, when it is more helpful to wand dps that last mob rather than squeeze in that last downranked heal.
---
unless you're running with a regular group and know what fights you won't need to heal much at all (like just throwing up a renew or the occassional flash-heal), generally want to want to be cautious till you've got a feel your for tank and stick to wanding if the damage isn't too spiky.
---
If you do know 100% that no healing will be required, fill free to lay in with spells to help end the fight faster.
---
Though priests use the 5-second rule a lot, so you definitely don't want to be using mana spells without a good reason unless you're at a full mana and need to cast SOMETHING.
---
Which parts do you think? Do you expect the damage numbers to be very different?
---
These are good tips, thanks!
---
At a grander scale this is still pretty sad.
---
Yep, this sounds like the rate I am used to for the past few years as well. Keep in mind that while the population will be lower in Classic than private, the number of players that need arcanite bar in relation to the the alchemists able to craft will likely remain relatively the same.
---
So 30g can be expected.
---
Hah, yeah don't worry brother, this will be my third warrior 1-60. Tow previous were leveled in 2004-06 I'm well aware of the fury meme and how arms is vastly superior with sweeping strikes and cleave, it's how I've always done it.
---
First classic Warcraft video, feedback welcome. Cheers
---
Hybride races
---
Did you just read the title and post this? I'm curious lol.
---
ew
---
Why do you think male dwarves drink so heavily?
---
On the upside, you can instant cast the mount if Hand of Edward the Odd procs.
---
I love this so much!
---
The sense of performance and character attachment. Pservers come and go so there’s less attachment to characters
---
considering that you've burned through multiple of those on one big farmraid evening it adds up quickly.
---
this also played a role in the sad story of thoridal. initially it gave hunters merely an average of a +100 dps boost and saved money (due to it not requiring ammo) then with the steady shot patch (3-4 months after the world first thoridal drop) it gave you no dps bonus over the bow from the twins and was only a money saving option. (#sadhunterlegendarystories)
---
They can solo mauradon easily. I used to have it down to a science.
---
That said, though, I think mages get better at farming gold once dire maul comes out
---
Vanilla is bad. This is coming from someone who has actually played it. 
---
Damn making arguments like an absolute fucking retard is really easy.
---
All of it because youre losing a lot of those buffs stacking especially during MC. Fury tanking with no shield might not be possible at all without enough buffs on you, we don't know yet. It comes down to how much and often spike damage actually happens and how much a bear or non shield tank can take.
---
not many...though you're much less likely to die when falling into water. (where as Tauren have a tendency to get stuck on stuff and potentially die falling into water if it's somewhat shallow). Though you also do tend to get dismounted in water pools that someone else could ride through with no problem.
---
Most of the replies here have pretty covered most of what I was going to say. Basically if you have mana to spare and your group isn't taking much damage feel free to help DPS but a lot of the downtime between pulls is waiting on healers to drink so not dpsing and saving your mana to reduce time between pulls will save you more time overall than trying to help DPS mobs down faster
---
I loved how in classic that even though how geared someone was, they always had at least one blue item that the better item of that just hadn’t dropped for them yet.
---
So long.. I do not have the patience ..
---
You’re missing the point. Getting a group together for those pally quest runs is hard, as a dps, most people will laugh at you. If you form the group as heals or tank you can probably get the group somewhat easily.
---
Could you elaborate why it didn't work in Maraudon anymore ?
---
Didn't we kill that dead horse down in some cellar while standing on a pile of bones for 100 times to get all these mounts for every Pala in the guild? I think I felt like living in that cellar for a while...
---
Nah, they’ve made it clear they’re committed to keeping Classic a thing, since the announcement. It’ll only ever be BC and Wrath in *addition* to Vanilla, not a replacement.
---
I'm guessing that was a rhetorical question.
---
Running in Org and instantly seeing the gear of everyone...I miss that.
---
It was more the time investment in dungeons, i think solo grinding is about double the xp and grinding with a good priest/shaman is probably around triple. Pally slightly less
---
I hope Blizzard will take a more flexible approach to deciding when each phase should be released. Coming up with a fixed schedule and sticking to it without taking into account things such as how fast content is cleared, how fast people are getting bored, how fast people level up, the ratio of hardcores and casuals etc. seems stupid. 
---
They probably already have a tentative schedule that they're talking about in private. But I hope they just give us a ballpark about how long each phase should last to get our feedback, and announce dates one phase at a time. 
---
Personally, I think the following timeline would make sense:
---
Phase 1: 4 months 
---
Phase 2: 2 months
---
Phase 3: 3 months
---
Phase 4: 3 months
---
Phase 5: 4-5 months
---
A hunter's biggest job is keeping track of the flag carrier. Pinging the map and calling out where someone is headed is huge for keeping someone from getting past mid field.
---
They can be decent at flag carrying in a pinch, but druids, mages, and rogues tend to have more success. Hunters are really good flag carriers in earlier brackets, though
---
Even on Pservers whereby the debuff doesn't stack it nets the same raid dps as a full t3 set if only 3 hunters are around to get one proc per minute. on 4 hunters its already pulling ahead.
---
T3 was initially meant as a joke (and that is not meant as a joke) and in its release form it is a convenience set. It helps mana revocery - but hunters already managed to handle their mana throughout the entirety of classic.  The initial t3 8 piece bonus was announced as 'You enrage when your pet dies'. That's correct. The initial set bonus was supposed to : hey you are bad your pet dies, here have a goodie...
---
They never took hunter T3 serious because they knew they had a rework for hunters in the oven for BC. (and while people never consider it a massive rework. I do. Half the attack power gain and viper to cover for the constant mana potion usage)
---
You think all the shit sites from back then are still up. Thats adorable
---
That's ok, you can say it's bad because it doesn't bother me, I couldn't care less what strangers on the internet think. See now was that so hard?
---
That's a fact I've become painfully aware, but I was referencing the premise in the previous post, so that if my additional explanation did not shed any light on the issue but, in fact, confused the reader even further, they might need to do some independent research before approaching the scope of this topic.
---
Warlock and Paladin both have quest chains for their epic mounts, it's the level 40 ones that are practically free on the trainers.
---
You're welcome
---
Dude you are wrong.
---
Everything you listed is incredibly easy to obtain compared to straight gold. 
---
You only have to run strath once to get what you need and arcanite bars are easier to get than you make it out to be. 
---
The Mount quest is not even close to being as much money or time as purchasing your epic mount
---
personalmente no creo que haya servers de habla hispana, pero ya veremos.
---
Watch the first 5 then, sums up why the dude is a fool. At 26min there is a tldr.
---
can you make one for every class please! thanks :D
---
Lmfao this guy has obviously never played on a private server before.
---
I could never do the Lyceum as a low level group. I love all the strategizing it takes to get it done though.
---
Yeah, those ghost wolves suck too. I pretty much always bring a mage to an SFK run. Not only do sheeps and decurses help, but 2 arcane explosions is all it takes to wipe those puppies out. Every second they’re up, that’s like 40% of my HP gone if I’m tanking.
---
Lucy.... aged well
---
My first character was a mage I levelled to 60. Honestly, mages in vanilla just aren't that exciting in my opinion. I found the warlock and druid to be WAAAAAY more fun. The class quests for those classes are outstanding, there's so much flavor! I've heard shaman is somewhat similar that way.
---
So I'd say warlock or shaman. Between those two I'd say if you like the idea of healing at 60 go shaman, if only interested in DPS go warlock. You'll have a blast with either of them.
---
Drowning where anyone else would just run through
---
If your pet is level 32 or higher and you know the Claw Rank 5 ability in order to teach it and if your pet has the training points available, you can teach your pet Claw Rank 5 regardless of any lower ranked abilities your pet may have. There is no need to train any lower ranks of Claw, although having your pet with a lower rank of Claw won't hurt anything either.
---
There is absolutely NO need to know every single possible rank of an ability to teach the higher ranks. In fact, for boars that are the only pet that can learn Charge, there is a bit of an oversight by Blizzard in that there are NO boars in the game that know Charge Rank 4. But there are boars with Charge Rank 5 and Charge Rank 6. And you can easily train Ranks 5 and 6 to your Boar.
---
Yeah there's that but the main reason for them being shit was because prior to their rework the only thing they were good for was tanking. 1.12 + gear makes them way too overpowered.
---
Eewwwww
---
Why wouldn't I? Which talents do you need as a PvP holy paladin that also aren't a part of the cookiecutter PvE build?
---
What ever you say type D. Meanwhile I'll take Mark Twain's advice since it's rather obvious you have a lot of experience.
---
It keeps you in range of your own wolf buff and to soak up a battleshout
---
you are in range to use sapper charges
---
you can dive in for a raptor yes (although you won't do this all the time. One prime example is when improved aspect of the hawk is up - the timeframe between autoshots will be too short and you'll lose dps this way)
---
Very based on population like everyone has said here. You gotta remember that us hardcore players have grown up and can only commit 2 hours a night to the game (maybe). You’ll be battling others like yourself who can put in the time, but I honestly feel it’ll be much better this time around than the original release.
---
I’m looking at having a fun time around and not destroying my life like last time.
---
who?
---
Because they will probably shut down soon, some have downtime,  but mainly every server end up adding pay to win. Even Chronus the the main Nostalrius competitor ended up adding pay to win on every single fron of the game.
---
You should never "need" to DPS trash. Unless you get comfortable doing it, it can risk a tank death. If you just sit "afk" waiting for an opportunity to heal, people won't really care. Maybe just wand for a bit if you get a tryhard group that asks if the healer is afk or something, when you're just waiting to heal.
---
&gt;I know that any cast stops my spirit-based mana regeneration, so I am not sure when the "correct" time to be doing DPS is.
---
You can skip casting a spell and just wand. It won't mess up your regen and is better than nothing. I don't imagine people will complain that you "only" did 50% of your potential DPS output as a healer. I've certainly never heard of it at least. The "correct" time comes with knowledge and experience. If you do a dungeon for the first time (especially high lvl ones), maybe be a bit passive on the DPS front just to learn the mechanics. Once you're comfortable, start finding places where you can assist with DPS.
---
&gt;Is it ever acceptable to just sit back and wand if there is no "healing/cleansing" that needs to occur?
---
This is ideal imo. If a priest starts wanding in my dungeons, I think of them as a better player. Well, so long as the tank doesn't suffer for it, of course. An active player trying to finish the dungeon through their full toolkit is better than one "just" fulfilling their role.
---
You're correct, honored and r3 are the only rebates available. Lots of people think you get more rebate with better rep status, but that's bullshit.
---
Played vanilla wow......
---
It's not that hard. 
---
You don't have to min/max and the people who do usually suck at actually playing their toons
---
I'm hoping Uldum for a super hard end game 10 man raid.
---
Because giant Dino’s aren’t enough to worry about. And those stupid plants. Lol
---
Mr. Tumnus!
---
Not true, there will be blood elves and space goats leveling up! :D
---
Pretty sure that was for their level 20 weapon.
---
What's the profit incentive? Blizz would need new subs to justify creating a whole new server type.
---
Alot of the p severs shut down numerous times or reopened and the server you were playing on died. This meant you lost everything and needed to reroll. This happened about 4-5 times depending so you needed to relevel and regear 5 times. Then there were really scummy business practices in most of the server except for nost. Selling rank 14 accounts gold and etc from the server hosts themselves through gold sellers. People just want an authentic classic experience without all the bullshit and chance of losing your time and progression. $15 a month is nothing for that security and honesty.
---
YARLY!
---
Is there a source or something on that? I keep seeing it repeated, but I don't remember hearing anything from blizz about price other than the sub price being shared. It's very possible that I missed it in the last couple of months in which I fell off the hype train a bit.
---
Yup, I remember when I was a child farming copper and selling it for a pretty penny a stack and ended up with 250 gold as a level 25 pally. It wasnt much but it was honest work.
---
I should run 4 warrior and 1 Ret pally group for the diversity
---
And you gotta remember that the hardcore player mold wasn't broken 15 years ago. A lot of 18-24yo players in the surveys.
---
Worse, the lvl 45 water for you...
---
Honestly it could be a bunch of fun man. I'm actually somewhat jealous of you. Sooner or later it's gonna happen: people will eventually add dungeons to their speed levelling, because if everything goes well (finding a group, getting to the dungeon, not wiping) dungeons can be efficient. Right now there's just too much risk involved for the reward for it to be appealing to speed levellers. I think you two could have a blast. Don't expect to be the first to hit 60, but you'll get there within a few months like most people.
---
lmao I bet you are just jealous cuz your ret pally can't do that 🤣🤣🤣
---
I feel like "not including crafting time" and being entirely dependent on server econmlomies gives an incredibly misleading potential gold per hour. It should be an estimated range if say 20-45g/h instead of a hard number.
---
This doesn't even include compeititon on resources.
---
You're gonna need about 3000 stacks of runecloth. Have fun.
---
Yeah. Auto run has been in since day 1.
---
True, but he won’t be battling against “seasoned veterans” and instead will be battling against newer players that never played Vanilla.
---
My buddies who are complete noobs are about to pour their lives into this game, but they have a ton to learn before they start kicking ass.
---
About 8 hours. That's how long. 
---
If you can't make 50+ gold/hr in WoW you're not farming effectively.
---
Because shamans cant sustain dps. They aren't wrong shamans have strong burst and then they oom. Many raids have nature resist. Shaman pvp is crazy raiding not so much.
---
go back to fortnite
---
Not my experience after playing 3 Paladins on private servers. People will take whatever they can get.
---
Thanks for the clarification. 
---
Wonder where all this "700g" talk is coming from. There's a fair bit of it in this thread.
---
Wait have they actually said this explicitly or is it interpretation on your part? I've been watching announcements closely but I might have missed it. This is huge for me if it's true
---
I will say this again,starting buffed with more than 8k mana and using runes and mana potions you can easily deal damage for 5 minutes just spamming LB.
---
Will auto attack with a bow work when right clicking a target, or will classic have the old way of needing a ranged auto attack bind?
---
I think the joke about hunter was the fact they were afk auto shot because they were always OOM and therefore could not do anything but auto shot. (Appart feign death and drink...)
---
As far as memorable videos from Vanilla goes. This one is right up there with World of Roguecraft and the Oxhorn machinimas.
---
In 6 mans, the way I see it is if everyone stays alive, you can do whatever tf you want with the rest of your mana.  I imagine this PoV would change based on who you are playing with. 
---
Raids are a different story.  You will always be mana hungry, and healing/heal cancelling/mana conserving will be pretty much all you do.
---
Corpse maker? Of course. I wouldn't be a warrior without it. Then whirlwind axe, then quest reward in plagulands
---
Classic won't be the same as vanilla in terms of timelines though. When Blizzard announced the phases they said something along the lines of "Classic will come out with phase 1 and we will move on to phase 2 when the players are ready".
---
The first phase is always precious which Blizzard knows so they will let the community decide when phase 2 gets released, which is the reason I think phase 1 will be at least 6 months long.
---
Few months? Nah we plan to try for 5-6 days played within the first two weeks
---
One has live pigs, the other has dead pigs

1. Blizz can produce a more authentic experience, as they have the entire 1.12.1 code--all the tuning, resists, etc that people have only been able to guess and attempt to emulate. It's known that some of these are off on pservers, and some may be off by a lot.
---
2. Pservers have a tendency to die. Admin drama, stealing donation money to pay for private bills, generating gold and r14s to sell, court orders to shut down, you name it, a server's closed for it.
---
3. Living in North America, an NA based server is simply a better option. There are no NA pservers, they get taken down right away once discovered. Ping isn't particularly vital in this game, but being able to shave off 300+ ms is nice.
---
I was kinda hoping the smack would be blue posts.
---
900g(800g after honor system release)
---
there was always enough quests to hit 60...if you did them in the right order.
---
aka doing most of the zones by level instead of following the regional path.
---
A lot of people by the time they started 30+ zones were ~8 levels lower than the game expected them to be, which is what creates the 35-45 quest gap.
---
it's also why the level banding of some zones seems off...it's actually not, you just came there MUCH sooner than you were intended to, so only a fraction of the quests are available. (some of which require starters from other zones you should've done by now to begin).
---
And that's at RELEASE. over time they further fleshed out 45+ zones with additional quests to make it less punishing for people who messed up and were scavenging xp from quests that were supposed to be getting them to 60 to fill the 35-45 gap.
---
(Keep in mind it wasn't until 3/4 of the way through TBC that the 35-45 gap was completely removed via revamping dustwallow to give you the 6-7 levels you were probably missing if you brute forced through a single region instead of visiting basically every region by level).
---
Yeah, don't know much about resistances on certain bosses in other raids,but it works great with Patchwerk and all the raid debuffs and buffs. What burst are you talking about??? You don't do burst when raiding cuz you oom fast,you spam different ranks of Lightning bolt and just sometimes when it's needed burst with CL and shock.

All I really need is Bagnon, or some other addon that merges all my bags into one window. Maybe I'll use Recount and AtlasLoot as well.

Oh ya I recall the priests and other caster classes wanding when they could to regen mana.
---
As someone who forms my own dungeon pug most of the time, anyone who *laughs* at a ret Pally for a 5-man is a tool. It’s fair to say, well, the Warrior tank wants most of the good peices so we’ll pick up a different dps for the moment. But not inviting someone solely on their spec is laughable for a 5-man. 
---
Obviously you have to think about your group makeup, still. You need to evaluate what CC you have for the dungeon, what loot competition will be like, and what kind of utility you have. Specifically for UD Strath, a ret Pally is great. Repentance for the caster elites, and an AoE stun for pretty much every other pack. 
---
Just as well, a ret is tanky enough to handle a mob without stressing. In raids, where you have to put out X dps in Y seconds, sure, you probably shouldn’t raid as ret and expect a good time. But 5-man content is fun because it brings out the utility of each spec. Like, even a boomkin is a solid choice for a 5 man. High short term dps, with innervate and battleres to save the group from a wipe.
---
Oh. Lol nevermind then. Don't do dungeons, at all. Quest and grind is the only way to do it in the timeframe you have specified.
---
Of course, but then again- that's not why I went Ret, now is it.
---
Consider the 300g you have to pay to be tax for people putting up with you.  Not the paladin class.  The class is ok.   It's a tax for the players the class attracts.   🤢
---
I dont see much changes tbh, fero bite scales with AP - thats certainly big, but hardly enough to take them from lowest tier to viable? Am i missing something - the haste changes they mention benefit ferals somehow?
---
Word of God is retail and classic will share a sub, so I'd have to say that yes, your tokens will pay for classic.
---
You may be interested in retail WoW, where you have have healers who incorporate melee attacks into their healing rotations/priorities.
---
After playing a lock and a paladin there were times where the only reason I died was because of the mount Mana cost. So yes, its free but can hinder you in some situations
---
Spamming dungeons from 13-60 is not fun, trust me.
---
nah fam druids have way way way more tps than warrs and ive mained both. druids meed to farm manual crowd pummelers and it gg for threat.
---
Yeah I can’t remember I know I went to 1-2 physical launches after digitals started, it was always fun to nerd convention inline
---
10 man
---
Sure, you could form a 10 man raid if you’re in blues, but it isn’t that hard to tune mobs to being a fair fight for a t3 lad and retardedly hard for a fresh 60
---
Okay that's what I thought. Ty
---
THIS is what the game is about.
---
Honestly, I feel like 500g isn’t THAT hard to get if you’re doing dungeons efficiently while you pick up your BiS or whatever tasty loot you want. Random mats, greens and grays, and floor money normally gives me anywhere from 10-20g in a run.
---
I’d say, the harder part is *keeping it*. Shits so damn expensive and all that money you earn goes right out the window when you want to work on professions, buy those skills you never bought, and repairs from that aweful MC pug. 
---
I always look at the money I make after a slew of dungeons and feel satisfied, until I go to buy more mana pots :/
---
But for today's standard you got to admit it sounds so damn fucking cringy
---
I didn't say that's a bad thing, it's funny to look back at old memes
---
Pepega
---
If it's even the same numbers as retail that'd be insane and would get the execs thinking maybe this microtransaction terrible bullshit isn't effective.
---
Ahh ok, I really like how much utility they have with totems.
---
Devilsaurrrrr hell ya gotta farm me some of that
---
I don’t know, I have this vivid memory of Blizz changing buff stacking in TBC, because we were progressing Karazhan at the time. Or was that just potions?
---
Since we actually had a BWL bear tank, I’m guessing that BWL, AQ40 are viable if it’s very much the same game as it used to be. I used to heal said bear so I think I had a pretty good feel for how much damage he was taking.
---
Could be wrong though, it’s been a long time. And I didn’t end up running AQ much.
---
They made you say those things, didn't they? It's a god damned conspiracy, I tell 'ya.
---
Farming 500g does NOT take weeks or months...
---
Can't mess you combat daggers rogue rotation, backstab and slice and dice. All. Day. Long.
---
The forgotten villain of WC3, he's awesome.
---
Yeah I remember crusader orbs running 50-100g in vanilla still pretty high price.
---
Only if you’ve been loading up on gamerfuel dew and Doritos for 6 meals in a row.
---
That's right... I distinctly recall that the majority of people were getting there epics when Naxx was released... man those YEARS flew by!
---
I don't care what they said, it was/is common to say they get a free epic mount even though they don't.
---
:D
---
In vanilla i played hunter with T2 equip 😊. now i want a different gameplay and roll shadow priest. 
---
i miss my hunter but now its time to choose a different way. can i beat myself will i fail in pvp 
---
this are my worries at the same time i am exited.
---
&gt; I do not want it to seem like I am ever "doing nothing" 
---
From my experience in classic WoW no one ever thought badly of a Priest that was "lazy" because they did not do any DPS. They would be upset if you pulled a small easy fight, then wiped because someone accidentally aggroed more mobs and you could not heal because you blew your mana on DPS. You have a wand you can use to add a little DPS in the downtime.
---
I have played and healed in FFXIV too. It's great fun mixing in DPS and healing when the content is not too hard. WoW just isn;t like that. Priest is still a fun class though, I enjoyed it.
---
&gt; I was wondering if we ran instances from 1-60 will it be as fast as running through quests (efficiently as possible)
---
Not even remotely. Dungeon spamming (even without taking the time to find 3 DPS, waiting on them to get there, etc) would take 2-3x longer than just running around killing things.
---
The only way you can do it in that timeframe through dungeons is with a dedicated group. The time you spend looking for 3 DPS will be so much downtime it would never be worth it. Plus with pugs you can never know if your run will be efficient or not.
---
As much as you want to carry, your gear just won't allow any sort of carrying, other than ensuring you hold threat. You need 3 skilled DPS who are dedicated to running the same dungeon over and over to make it work.
---
You might not want to wholly subscribe to that 2hander option, I just found out about this item called [Julie's Dagger](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6660), and it used to scale off of Spirit (according to some memories of how it worked 15 years ago). I read somewhere that "even many bosses couldn't break through the health per second that was achievable".
---
Again, not saying this is the best thing since sliced bread (because no one knows the exact scaling as it was in 2006) but if you get your hands on one of these things - give it a chance. Oh and it's a non-Unique item, so you can dual wield 2 of them!
---
Am I the only one who uses ‘r’?
---
“People who min/max usually suck” funny, but that’s not how it works. More often than not those people are better at the game.
---
Because I think subs will dwindle after a certain number of years of Classic. I’m gonna enjoy the hell out of Classic for 2-3, maybe even 5 years. But people are going to take a break at *some* point. 
---
Meanwhile, BC is stupidly easy to replicate, much easier than Classic. Therefore it’s an even lower cost, for a potential and likely profit. 
---
Keep in mind, subs *continued* to climb, all the way from Vanilla, to BC, to Wrath, to Cata launch, where it began to rapidly decline, and they started to rely on cash transactions rather than subs. 
---
Regardless of your opinion on TBC and Wrath, I think you underestimate the desire people have to play it, and overestimate how long people will play Classic for. Me, personally, I’ve got 2 fresh restarts in me before I’ll long for something that’s different, but still isn’t BFA, or whatever Modern expac will be out. And I’ll unsub, as many will, at some point.
---
And also, servers of any xpac won’t be ghost towns unless they make *too many*. We already know Blizzard is lowballing the demand of Classic, since they aren’t releasing rpvps. If they were gonna make
---
100 total servers, they would have enough slots to bump some in, but, like in 2004, they’re lowballing their expectations, which is a solid business decision. It makes sense that they would do the same with BC, and even if the BC subs *were* low, there would at least be 100-200k to fill out a small handful of servers.
---
A feral tank will often be first in damage too. You get a free additional dps.
---
Gold is classic was HARD to come by.  Even if you sold everything you're still going to be broke.
---
Sorry if I mislead. They didn’t say anything about BC or Wrath. But they did say about Classic, that they would keep it so long as thousands, hundreds, or tens of people play it. They are committed to keeping it on. This was at the initial reveal from Jay Allen Brack, right after the ice cream joke and the cinematic.
---
Questing is most efficient if you follow the quests by zone. You don't need to do all the starter areas. And you can usually skip 1 of the 5-10 areas. But the 10-15 and 10-20 areas, you'll generally want to starting doing all of them, in whatever order is convenient.
---
Mixing in dungeon quests can actually throw off the leveling path, so...prior to 30, if you're doing every single possible dungeon quest, you typically can be a little sloppy on doing every single zone, but by around 25+ zones, you are expected to be doing basically all of them and the dungeon quests don't really mess up the path anymore because your triviality threshold is increasing faster than you can do quests at that point (the triviality threshold doesn't start increasing till 30 and goes up 1 for every 5 levels there after (so at 30 quests 6 levels lower are still green. At 35 quests 7 levels lower are still green, and so on).
---
Generally, you should hit 60 (or be really close to it if you've gotten lazy on doing dungeon quests) before you even get to the level 50+ zones.
---
That was my general experience from leveling my alts during classic. It was a substantially smoother ride than the one my Main went through (who ironically wasn't even my first 60, since he was hobbled by the 35-45 quest gap and struggling to get the last 5 levels, while my Rogue and Warlock breezed through to 60 with no issues since i didn't fall into the gap this time since purely on a whim I decided to do zones by level instead of following the regional path like I did on my main.
---
That much? To get from halfway revered to exalted?
---
I don’t think they are bro. They have only really said they are doing a server option from all that I’ve read.
---
My wife asked me why I have seemed distant the last few days. My answer: "I'm dreaming of Azeroth."
---
She thought it was a vacation spot and looked it up. Even asked me how to spell it. Lol
---
What bonus content lol? There is none 😂
---
Excellent job debunking this! One thing that a lot of people don't understand is this was the time period where blizzard really, really knew what they were doing when it came to balance. It's inconceivable that blizzard would purposefully release a new tier set dungeon that was setup to be so difficult that it was virtually impossible. Can't wait to run it myself in classic!
---
Man, the best part of healing in vanilla is how chill the role is to play really, at least for me, and you are asking for more work to do apart from healing? For a first time player healing may appeal like a lot of responsability and hard work, but it's by far the less "active" role in a 5-men dungeon. Most of the time you just press a button every 5-10 seconds and that's it. I don't like tanking at all, simply because it demands too much awareness and fast reactions when people screw up with threat, ass pulls etc. so it kinda exhausts my mind being so focused on something for 2+ hours. For DPSs it can either be a chaotic gameplay if you are the kind of competitive person, specially because it's the only role that "competes" (on damage meters) with other people on every dungeon run, so the competitive mentality kinda grows on you unconsciously when you play DPS, or it can be even more chill than heals if you are a slacker but people will get mad at you for slowing down the group.
---
Here is the way I usually like to run dungeons as healer, you light up some real nice herb, choose any dope music playlist of your taste, open a secondary (or primary) other game/website that also doesn't requires too much of attention (reddit + pokemon showdown is just perfect if you are into competitive pkmn battles) then just go for it. When group is dealing with easy pulls or eating/drinking you just alt+tab to the other game/website. You may spend like 30-60% of the run alt-tabed if you know what you are doing and knows the place, no joke. WoW is just a way too slow game for today's parameters and this is one of the main reasons I love it.
---
Especially on a fresh server, 300g is more than most people realize.
---
&gt; Keep in mind, subs continued to climb, all the way from Vanilla, to BC, to Wrath, to Cata launch
---
Yes, any 99% of those subscribers who left and would potentially come back are going to come back for Classic Vanilla. It's really hard for me to imagine there's a TBC enthusiast (like me) who is going to sit out Classic Vanilla but then decide to sign up for Classic TBC. The games are too similar.
---
The profit incentive for Classic TBC then becomes one, as you suggest, in which Blizz tries to regain Classic Vanilla subs that have lapsed. But that total is going to be a small % of the total Classic Vanilla subs, imo. They might be able to fill a couple of servers but that's not really that much money. 
---
And they're certainly not even going to consider it until they see what kind of playerbase Vanilla has maybe a year after the final Phase. Because if there's a big dropoff, then that implies the expected lifetime of Classic TBC would be 2 years, tops, since there is far less original content in TBC than Vanilla.
---
I appreciate your real experience. I never cleared Naxx, but I had experience on every boss with the exception of Sapphiron and KT (NO real 4H attempts as we didn't have the tanks). My guild basically lost the will and player base to finish Naxx as TBC was imminent (I think it was like 1-2 months away when we were wiping on Loatheb). 
---
I've seen a bunch of people claiming how expensive it was to raid Naxx and I just never had that experience. I was an Herb/Alch and was rolling in gold from making flasks and elixirs for people while farming herbs and running dungeons.
---
Naxx attunement was not a factor at all to raiding Naxx. It was relatively cheap even if you didn't have the rep (But almost everyone had the rep already).
---
I remember the raid being brutally hard (at times), but I never felt like I couldn't afford to raid or required to be all world buffed and flasked, etc. for every boss/encounter. I recall using Heigen Dancing as a recruitment trial for new members (With some memorable failures).
---
I'm glad some of the misinformation is getting called out. I feel like there are a bunch of people misrepresenting themselves with regard to their Vanilla experience and just using Private Server experience to flesh it out.
---
1000g before your double discount.
---
I’m down with this under two conditions...
---
1, that they keep an original version of the game available. What if some Uber awesome dungeon comes out and makes a good chunk of original 5 man content irrelevant? You have to provide the original game for people who want everything from the *vision* of the creators. 
---
2, that they don’t *keep* pumping content in. Azeroth feels great because it doesn’t feel like a theme park. There are empty zones, claustrophobic zones, and everything is spaced out with attention to variety and atmosphere. If they add a new 5 man dungeon every couple months, that’s cool, but after a while there will just be *too much clutter* in the world. Personally, I think WoW Classic has room for 5-8 dungeons and 2-3 raids, and *thats it*. They really have to hang up the towel with it at some point, otherwise the original idea of the game gets brutalized in the process. 
---
It’s not even that I don’t *trust* Blizz, but more that there was a lot of thought put into the way the game works. Adding fluff for texture is good, but only to an extent, and 10 years down the road, if you keep fluffing it up, all you have is fluff.
---
Cool
---
While I don't think you got banned for no reason, those things happen.  
---
I would contact the reddit admins and see what they can do.
---
There is almost 0 chance that you will get to lvl60 without getting revered with your faction and will take at worst situation 2 weeks to get to rank 3 pvp.
---
Action Bars then removing Profanity filter
---
show bobby for 32000 rupees maaam
---
you will have to bind it seperately, melee is the default
---
Grinding in lieu of questing/whilst travelling and always for mobs 1 level above you if possible. Guide on fast levelling here if ur interested:
---
If I could I would. That model is awesome
---
Haha thats just not true. Try healing some +15s with grievous
---
Will try to do it... this was a lot of work haha

---
Added all of them! I don't know how could I forget the chicken escorts... most painful quests ever in a PvP server.
---
Added! Had no idea this was a thing. Thanks for the heads up!
---
No idea how that happened...
---
I think people who find positive things about dogshit are mentally ill.
---
Things start to pickup when you get Shadowform.
---
Yes, leveling dungeons are very efficient if you do quest runs. But even in terms of grinding XP, if you dont skip packs but just keep a steady pace, because of 3 reasons: Elite grants bonus XP, 5man groups grant bonus XP and a 5man group is more than the sum of its parts, if played well.
---
The reason why people shy away from them in terms of speed leveling is because it is hard to find good, efficient groups.
---
In terms of the Warrior spec: It is almost always better ot spec into arms, not fury, *especially* when partnering with a healer because of sweeping strikes.
---
Farm Dire Maul Lashers and Dogs. 15/g a run. 5 runs an hour. 75g/hr.
---
I got a Krul Blade and like 15 Traveler's Backpacks in the course of a week too. 
---
It's easily done. Just have to do it.
---
So then it's not really 900g. It's 900g plus the time it takes to get your discount. By simply trying to correct my post to a flat "900g/800g" you misrepresented the actual effort required in obtaining what was actually a fuck load of gold in vanilla.
---
King Gordok can no longer be separated from Cho'Rush the Observer in Dire Maul.

In 5 man content you won’t be expected to dps but trying to squeeze as much out of your class as possible should always be encouraged! 
---
You will have mana issues but you can figure out the balance. I’d say if your mentality is like that you’ll do great!
---
In raids, however, you won’t have time to dps unless you’re out-gearing the raid by a lot.
---
I have no doubt In my mind that at least *one person* at Blizzard is planning for BC. Kind of like how some people in Blizzard are planning for *the expansion after the expansion after* BFA. Not in a concrete sense, but in a preparationary and proactive sense. Gauging how much traffic will necessitate a green light or red light. Of course they won’t green light a follow up before the original is out though, that much is obvious. 
---
Also, I disagree. I think people who played Classic back in the day are going to be *the minority*. Many newbies will flock to the game to see what the buzz is all about with the original monster MMO. Some will unsub quickly, some will stay subbed, and some will tag along to the party towards the end of the life cycle. So long as there is fresh blood, that’s incentive to release BC. Also, I still think BC is profitable, even if a fraction of the Classic population will play it. It’s a very low cost project.
---
Hell, even if you spend the gold on getting the items yourself, having a second or even third warlock in your group is quite useful in keeping the bell, candle, and wheel running during the event.
---
There is no item there. The quest is started by an [object](https://classicdb.ch/?object=131474).

Glad to help! :D
---
It was never common to say they get a free epic mount. It's not common today to say they get free epic mount.
---
They get a free mount. A FREE MOUNT. That's it. Epic Mount has never been mentioned period. It was never common say that. Ever.
---
"Paladins and Warlocks get a free mount". That's is ALL that has ever been said.
---
Anyone who says they free epic mount, is and always has been lying. And is less than 0.000000000001% of the people who have ever played game, even counting the people trying to make it a meme.
---
PfUI hopefully
---
Yeah I tried looking there, but there are only 32 items, and almost all are missing :(
---
I've removed this thread as it doesn't really make sense and I'm struggling to understand what you're asking. There aren't GMs on Reddit or Discord, at all.

Well said.
---
Feels good to know that I'm not alone with my rage over these pathetic private server mongrels and their wannabe guides.
---
Though to be honest I don't get the call for tips out here. His content is basically no different. massive misinformation with the occasional news wrap-up
---
It doesn’t take weeks or months if you dedicate time to farming. If you just get the good passively then yeah, maybe that long.
---
It's pretty easy to make a macro that will tell you your current coords. No need for an addon for that capability.
---
why is there stormwind docks there?
---
This is a private server method that isn't confirmed to work on classic. 
---
The way you make money on private servers != the way you make money on vanilla/classic.
---
I personally did that for a while. Shaman + Warrior is extremely strong and fast because they synergize so well. The Shaman can spec into resto until he gets his tier1-3 key talents like Tidal Focus, Totemic Focus, Totemic Mastery and Nature's Guidance, these talents are extremely efficient while duo leveling. The Warrior can spec straight into arms to get Sweeping Strikes ASAP.
---
You want to do efficient quests together preferably in spots with high mob density. You can use your time while questing to prepare dungeon prereq quests and to find dungeon groups. Doing every leveling dungeon like 1-3 times is good for XP and income if you know what your doing and keep a high pace.
---
That's simply not true, as the other guy says. Rogues can definitely slaughter a druid within a stunlock, the same way Rogues can kill each other under a stunlock. Rogues and Druids have the same Armor if the Druid is not in Bear form, therefore the same survability in that case under a stunlock.
---
Instant cast heal is on a 3 min CD (Nature's Swiftness), the only Druid Stun (Bash) is on a 1 min CD and can miss, be resisted, be parried and dodged, so I personally don't land it on rogues like 30% of the time, and virtually never land it when the rogue has Evasion on. Root is removed by Rogue Vanishes (even under Faerie Fire) and it's not that easy at all to have a window to cast it.
---
In Bear form Druids hit like every 2.5 sec, part of which is parried, dodged, misses, so despite great HP pool and armor, a rogue will kill a Bear Druid 1v1 anyway. Go ahead and show us Druids beating Rogues in Duels on videos. I can certainly show you evidence on how they struggle to death in such fights, and eventually loose.
---
Ah you are talking mostly druids. I am probably going horde so it becomes less viable due to wf. Whenever I see his videos mentioned I immediately think his DW tank build
---
Stop stealing my 3 year old cousin's art projects.
---
minus ya know, northrend
---
I didn't watch the entire video, actually I quit a few minutes in because it felt it was just meme after meme after meme. Even the TLDR at the end is full of memes.
---
Really, sometimes less is more. I think a good content-to-meme ratio is something like 90% content 10% meme, and only if you think it's actually funny and fitting.
---
Thanks for the last few minutes of the video though.
---
at the moment you can only speculate, if private server farming will equal classic wow farming, i personally expect the most popular methods of farming on pservers will be cut down to bone in classic
---
Definitely gonna use auctioneer or the equivalent. Also something like altoholic to keep track of which alt has what item in their inventory.
---
3x slower, so 30 days to get 1.5 levels rested instead of 10 days
---
Did you have a libram? Was it in your bags?
---
Lol good point, max 1.5 levels, not really worth it at low levels :)
---
Peace friend
---
How does one recovers an account? I have lvl 60s
---
It still ends up been a lot cheaper than most other classes though.
---
In all honesty, you come across as a bit of an ass hole.
---
It's not hard to counter someone's arguments in a 'debunking' video without constantly calling them stupid and an idiot.
---
I'm not saying hamster wheel's video is  accurate or that you are wrong, but raiding difficulty is relative to how good the guild is. Top server guilds with good players are going to find it easy, while casual guilds won't. I don't see the point of the arguments going around about how difficult Vanilla raiding was.
---
But then again, it doesn't require a bag slot.
---
sounds like that raid needs new hunters
---
You get to lvl 60 by doing quests. Doing quests gives you rep. You can't be a lvl 60 without revered unless you've been pretending that you are playing some Asian RPG like Lineage 2 and was just killing boars with "Live to win" playing in the background. So, it's not an effort at all to achieve a discount for an epic mount because you will need a lvl 60 to buy an epic mount and while getting there you will get your rep.
---
That Mana is impressively low
---
What is word of god lmao you mean word of mouth? Unless Jesus himself announced some stuff
---
I don't expect it to be the same either.  If anything, I'm expecting it to be slightly faster over the course of all 6 phases, with phase 1 being similar in length to what it originally was. As I mentioned in another post in this thread, I do hope that Blizzard remains flexible in terms of the timeline and announce the dates one phase at a time. 
---
But the original timeline sure wasn't too fast, even back then when everyone sucked. Even in the EU, it wasn't too fast when there was only around 2 months between phase 1 and 2. That's because the content will still be there, even in phase 6. Most people won't mind if they can't do BWL for the first few months after that phase is released, because for them, leveling is the main content. 
---
Either way, as you said,  Blizzard will hopefully listen to the players so I'm fairly confident that they will get it mostly right, whatever getting it "right" means.
---
I remember farming alterac valley quests for an hour or two at a time back when AV lasted forever. Gives rep with all factions, even got exalted with blood elves in the prepatch before BC dropped. Day 1 of burning crusade I was an undead on a chicken.
---
You can kill 3 mobs at the same time if needed, but it will cost you more mana than if you just killed them 1 by 1. 
---
You need to use fear, shield, need to apply inner fire more often, you'll be wanting to mind blast on CD to get the first mob down quick. Your shield will break faster which prevents you from using mind flay (until you have focused casting at higher levels). 
---
The benefit is you can have 3 pains rolling at the same time but, it's not really worth it. You'll need to drink after you've killed 3 at once.
---
Ya I tend towards running dungeons untill the mobs are green. I'm a very experienced tank and my friend is equally good as healing. We will measure the exp per hour and decide from there.
---
It was Rattlegore and he hit for chunks, it was even somewhat hard with all 60s. I remember doing it with guildies at 70 and failing several times
---
Everyone saying that seems to think +600g, 750 maybe, perhaps even 800g, means 'free'.
---
Or that farming stuff means its also free, even though you could have sold it.
---
It takes alot longer for most normal players to grind the gold needed than it takes a pally to do the quests etc. Let's be real here, the paladins get a massive advantage with this, especially including the basically free 40 mount.
---
It isn't confirmed? I fucking did it in Vanilla what are you talking about? 
---
It's a 13 year old method.
---
Do you still need to buy the training though? I'm assuming not cause that would make the price way over a normal epic mount
---
And health impressively high
---
Thanks man. Wasn’t sure if that pserver I was playing on had changed that.
---
Couldn’t finish it- your obsessing mocking in the first 3 minutes was off-putting. No idea if it gets better later but not interested in finding out. If his video was bad, touch on a few points as to why instead of all the memes and then get to the point.
---
The whole dungeon.
---
This I dread playing without it
---
i like if this would happen, and if it does not. I bet the addon creators will just datamine them selfs once we can download the client.
---
I was going to play a Warlock but my friend picked Warlock first so I picked the other "Shadow" caster and chose Priest. He quit a few months later and I'm so glad I picked the Priest instead of the Warlock lol.
---
it's missing one little thing for perfection. the rogue sitting afk in stealth in a corner before the entire raid could see stealthed raidmembers
---
I thought people were saying that 1.12-TBC pre-patch AV was quick as hell so that's why so many people are upset about it.
---
Of course, it was hard to come by; but 450 gold by level 60 as a Paladin or a Warlock, is not really that much, and is more than able to be made.
---
You both are dumb, it's honored for 10%, and noone gets to lv 40 without it unless they're botting. So yeah epic mount is 900 phase 1, and 800 phase 2+, because some might get lv 40 mount without rank 3, but noone will get epic mount without it after phase 1.
---
I did single pulls when I leveled my priest. PWS =&gt; SWP =&gt; Mindflay until mob reaches you =&gt; wanding and no spells before next pull. If the mob is hard hitting you can use scream.
---
Don't use Mind Blast often. It is a good spell when you have surplus mana or when you want to drink anyways. Or sometimes the next pull is a bit far so you can use it as well.
---
You can pretty much keep both your health and mana continuously high with that style and almost never need to drink. It *feels* a bit slow but is faster and safer than Warrior, Shaman, Paladin and single target Mages etc.
---
I was there... 
---
3000 years ago
---
Seem to remember that dropping quite a lot for me last time around
---
*kick*
---
*laughs in rogue*
---
This. It’s poor argumentation to mock your opponent. Even if you are right, you look bad doing it.
---
I don't think anyone said they get a free epic mount.  THey get a free normal mount.
---
Yeah, I don’t know about the fury thing. I honestly wouldn’t trust most tanks to have the awareness to switch to shield when needed. 
---
I’m still on the fence regarding horde vs alliance. I might actually play shaman if I decide to go healing again. I don’t like playing priest or paladin, I used to play druid but I always regretted not having a rez, and I love being able to buff people with wind fury. 
---
Anyway, that’s just me rambling...
---
Joined start of TBC and end up maining a Resto Shaman. Thought about shaman again but wanted to try something new and didn't want to heal. Figured Mage sounds awesome and in all the expansions I've never mained one. I'm playing with 4 lifelong IRL friends and they're playing Warrior, Druid, Shaman, Rogue. Then I  played a priest on a classic private server to 22 and realized I love priest (also never mained one) and really enjoy and miss healing. The Druid friend decided he doesn't want to heal and the shaman wants to be able to tank. So the shaman friend switched to feral druid, Druid switched to Hunter and I landed on Priest. There's something so satisfying about healing and tanking for me, so I'm stoked to play a *Priest* and heal.
---
I feel like I genuinely sucked back in the day but have having played both BFA and Vanilla recently I realized I have such a greater understanding of the game and am much more analytical about what I'm doing nowaday. When I started I was a kid and just played mindlessly - which was just fine! But I'm excited to play though with a better understanding and skill cap now as an Adult. Y'know, actually think through what I do and why I do it; not just copy someone else's talents but read through and decide myself; duel and learn to PvP; Max trade skills, etc..
---
The middle way: Down Syndrome with tusks.
---
...and I would argue there STILL isn’t anything like it on the market today. WoW saw nothing but sustained and unprecedented growth until Cataclysm. There’s a reason for that.
---
As in make another post saying it has all the updates?
---
You can get under the Inn at Sentinel Hill in Westfall.
---
&lt;3
---
During late TBC, I created a set of alts of every class and leveled all of them to the mid 60s before WotLK released. I liked playing 5 of 'em. Warlock, Hunter, Druid, Paladin, and Priest. Hated Mage, Shaman, Rogue, and Warrior. So on Classic, I figure I'll see about getting one of my "fav five" as my main and then see about leveling the remaining 4. Although given some crying I saw in chat while in STV, I'm tempted to see about trying a mage again. Some rogue was crying and threatening in chat in STV that he was going to report a mage for "exploiting" if the mage wouldn't stop AoE grinding and pulling more than 3 mobs at a time. Claimed that pulling a lot of mobs and killing them was an exploit. I understand the rogue's pain since when I played a rogue I found it tough handling 3 mobs. But if he wants to kill a lot at the same, then damn it, pick a class of doing it and spend the time to get the skill to do it. But, I do want to get into end game raiding and of the "fav five", I figure that a holy priest has the best chance of being offered a slot and I enjoy healing, so it's likely that the priest will be my main, and I'll level either a hunter, warlock, or druid as my gold farmer. Paladins are rather crippled in Vanilla as compared to Burning Crusade and later.
---
I'd guess that you can't kill Cho'Rush, reset the king and then kill the King, but I don't think it's exactly that, as the [original video](https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=27092) was uploaded 7 months after that patch hit. It is mentioned that the footage dates from before the DM:E video, but that video was only uploaded a month prior to the DM:N one.
---
Either way, even if it is as I surmised, having Cho'Rush alive while kiling the King doesn't make the fight impossible, only harder.
---
Yes, concerning this information:

Dudes a jackass lol. I really enjoy your stuff Frost! Watched all of your profession videos over the last week, and looking forward to watching your twitch streams!
---
Will try to do Alliance when I get some more free time. Will take longer though, since I haven't really leveled as Alliance in probably a decade haha
---
Added. Thanks for the heads up!
---
When you load on a FRESH and forgot to download it. It's a bad day.
---
I didn't have a problem with quests, either, and I leveled my character within the first few months of release. I did however run dungeons multiple times for certain pieces of gear I really wanted so that definitely helped.
---
Hi, /u/Apollexis
---
Recovering accounts you've sold, everyone get in here!
---
Dont just forget the REAGENTS  please. All of it is really expensive. Its basically the same cost. Maybe 100g cheaper.
---
Yeah, some of the olde internete language was so painful.  When I joined this site eons ago, rage comics were all the..... rage.... and they were really painful.  It felt like the site was bein run by 8th graders.
---
Raiding guilds tend to look toward the next week, or month. Not the next year.
---
Getting a fifth rank of ferocious bite was huge as well.  Back then spells had ranks, and each rank was progressively better, rather than automatically improving every level.  So getting a much better Ferocious Bite that also scaled with attack power on their combo finisher really did raise their DPS quite a lot.  
---
It wasn't like they were superb DPS with the changes, someone in here said it was about hunter, which feels right, but without the changes... gee.  It's not Ret pally bad, but it really didn't feel good, y'know?
---
You are correct and I agree with everything you said. I was also in Naxx and we were never that hardcore buffed as the people do it on private servers and when you killed C'Thun you should be able to clear a lot of Wings.
---
But was it necessary to call someone stupid and an idiot 200 times? I think this is why you also get downvoted a lot, not because you are wrong. There was no reason to excessively smash someone over a fucking game.
---
I would also like to encourage you, to make videos from a hardcore player perspective, because I feel there is a lot of misinformation spread around from the P-Server Community, but drop the name calling dude. It just comes across like a mega douche in a not funny way.
---
You are the reason I get hated on for playing hardcore and it's annoying.
---
Sure. You have to be careful with aggro, since Pets are a bit meh on that front, but can work. As long as the pet is spec'd probably for the role. (Hunters are a bit better than locks at this IMO as hunter pets have more customization and you can much more easily tailor them to be a decent tank. Blueberry isn't completely terrible but he's definitely worse than some well spec'd hunter options).
---
A gorilla built for armor/important resistance/hp will do pretty well (Thunderstomp deals pretty good threat and helps in unavoidable aoe situations).
---
Prior to gorilla, pretty much any tanky pet without too much of a damage penalty will typically do pretty fine.
---
if you use something like a turtle or crab, they'll have potential aggro problems (they're fine for the hunter, since he can dump threat, but less good for party tanking). Scorpid are pretty good (if it's got scorpid poison, it can actually deal pretty decent threat despite the slight damage penalty). 
---
If you can teach it screech (lowest level creature with it is 17 in westfall), bats/owls/vultures can be alright, the AP reduction helps somewhat with survivability and aoe threat (and won't break CC like Thunderstomp does). (the vulture is tankier, the owl/bat deal better threat).
---
obviously the more CC you can use the better as it just makes things more controllable.
---
Where is the runecloth turn-in??
---
I highly enjoy your videos. Thank you, Frost!
---
Your 5 minute smoke is 20 mins wasted for party and you have ample time during flight / travel to do so.  Smoking is a choice not a necessity.  Your choice is not more important then the time of your group.  Breaks will be taken in between runs use that time for your smoking.  My time is a lot more important then your habit and if you feel like you NEED it then smoke at PC.
---
Yeah I don’t really appreciate their attitude, but I understand where they’re coming from. They’ve been burned before.
---
Dungeons will go faster if no one dies compared to 1 or 2 deaths and the healer getting in some dps.
---
Classic wow isn't something you buy it's included in the sub.
---
They've officially stated that.
---
Yup no pauses for smoking at my house.  You want to miss part of the movie that's on you
---
\&gt;not being a hopeless NEET
---
lol all your abilities got pruned
---
Same here. People talk about it as a marathon. Sure it took time to level to 60 but I never remembered it being agonizingly slow. As for the quests I think there was an adequate amount, but I had to grind some mobs occasionally.
---
Wasn’t the level 40 mount free?
---
What about warlocks? I know there’s a quest for it but is it as much trouble as the paladin one?
---
They've straight up said they'll share a sub. It's not separate. You sub and play classic and current wow
---
IF was the city people used almost exclusively in vanilla
---
The good part about vanilla is that there are so many like minded people to play with.
---
The beauty of being a responsible healer
---
Trying to decide:
---
1.Level with mining and skinning for mount money.
---
2. Level herbalism and skinning. Drop skinning at 60 for alch after buy mounts.
---
3. Just level herb and alch the while time.
---
Rattlegore was soloable at 70...
---
Raiding in vanilla was difficult for the majority because we didn't have the information that we had today. We've had years of farming these instances and raids now with near accurate statistics. We don't even know the true stats of most mobs and weapons so all of our information could change when it drops. Calling people stupid using hindsight is ridiculous.
---
Hitting 60 without going to Burning Steppes, EPL, Winterspring or Silithus is unlikely
---
This totally did not happen to OP....or me....or you.....
---
The balance you should be looking for is depends on the group and the dungeon.
---
* Sometimes the tank may be undergeared, overpull or the DPS are not waiting and have mobs on them which means you will be on ready alert the entire time. This includes casting a big heal and either letting it go through or canceling it by moving, because waiting until the big hit happens + the heal cast time might be enough time for two or three big hits to kill the tank. This is sometime to practice for harder content or hard hitting pulls.
---
* There may be some groups where everyone is doing their jobs well and you can more or less DPS at full capacity as if you were questing (while not draining your entire mana bar just in case) and that could helps boost the dps and speed. This is more or less the safer method. The only real risk is that the group might not be watching you mana and you might get a big pull when you aren't ready for it so self discretion is key. 
---
* Alternatively, if you feel like your group can handle it, you can ask them to be more aggressive with the pulls, and dedicate your time to just pumping out heals and chain pulling. This kind of depends on the Tank's skill they should be aware of what is a big pull and what's "too much" and when it's time to pause the action for mana users to drink. Good tanks will typically time this to coincide with a patrol or dangerous pull that needs waiting on anyway, minimising the downtime while maximizing the safety. For me this is the optimal way to go. Everyone is asked to play their role optimally, and everyone is playing to their strengths. It's also good practice for everyone for when accidental pulls happen and things need to be done on the fly.
---
A wow2 would be great. So although I think your conspiracy theory is totally wrong, take my upvote
---
The Vanilla world with full VR support.  Chromie's time combobulator splinters the time stream, and we're in an offshoot where the Dark Portal doesn't get opened.  Instead the Emerald Dream happens and they go from there.
---
Unwatchable. I can be a jerk when it comes to gaming debates, but I wouldn't create a video filled with my assholisms and expect anyone to watch it.
---
Paladins don't have seals any more.
---
Not like he has on his bar.
---
Oh man. I remember the first time I had to choose between a staff and a dagger for my Warlock. "Why WOULDN'T I pick the staff? The dagger is so much weaker!" ....... "Wait, what do you mean I can hold stuff in my other hand?"
---
First character. I was a silly goose.
---
“My account had gotten stolen that year, so the info may have been changed” 😂😭
---
VR would be good for mmorpg if it was rp only. Currently it's just bad for any other activity imo.
---
Farming to sell stuff means there are people willing to buy stuff.
---
At the end of the day there's no more gold in circulation than the total of what people are getting from NPCs (quests and merchants) and not losing (repairs and auction house fees.)
---
Which means the guy you replied to is right, a lot of people didn't have eic mounts because those people funneled money into *your* epic mount instead (by buying your stuff.)   
---
Not you literally, but those of us who farmed.
---
For a while now blizzard has been holding on the raids release dates after patches hit. So if the patch comes out at the end of May like Wowhead estimated there is no way in hell that blizzard releases Classic when the latest raid is not even a month old.
---
Was a good video, maybe a bit too long.
---
Copper funded my lvl 40 mount in early tbc. I ran around elwynn for hours, selling it at 2-3g per stack.
---
revered/exalted do not give reduzion. also the 10% scale off the base price, so it's 1'000g / 900g / 800g
---
The easiest way is to take a photo of your ID and submit a live chat ticket. Attach the photo of your ID and give as much description of your characters/realms as you can remember. You'll get a response in a few minutes. I was able to recover both of my accounts from over 10 years ago in under 10 minutes.
---
I remember the initial reaction of having the op soul harvester, then with time one realises that the trinket is a 1 time opportunity while the harvester can be replaced in the future.
---
WoW2 happened a long time ago, and it was called burning crusade
---
My axe is looking forward to it! For the Horde
---
nope. plenty of content. And it means you get to turn the majority of those 50+ quests into gold now that you're capped out.
---
of course you CAN go there if you want to, but I don't see much point, since those quests have generally higher xp, and therefore higher XP-&gt; gold conversion.
---
Also since you'll only have quests 48+ be still green at 60, you definitely want to do all of the 47 and under ones before then so that you get the most value out of them.
---
low effort post
---
Blizzard ruined the game
---
It was soloable at 60. 
---
If you played the right class.
---
Meh, all the bc stuff came out a month later. 2.0 was pretty much still classic. 2.0 pretty much only had talents, and honor changes, it was like classic + hybrids for a month.
---
Did you watch the video? He isn't calling people stupid using hindsight, he was in the 16th guild worldwide that killed KT during Vanilla and he actually dissects all of hamster's points about what make Naxx so hard (And actually goes on to call out what was actually hard in naxx and what wasn't).
---
Fuck yes, alternative classic patches/expansions would be amazing.
---
Hopefully. 
---
Though, while the Classic team seems pretty on the ball, I still think that Blizzard's creative spark has withered under the calcifying flow of finance and marketing people, their management bulges with Peter Principle victims, and culture/gender/race-war political ideology has infested their workforce. 
---
WoW had soul. I'm not sure if many of the people coming back to play a game with soul would be expected to patronize the cynical project that I think WoW 2 would inevitably be.
---
Yeah, it's harder to bring more Druids in general as horde let alone Cat Spec Feral Druids as horde because of how good Shaman totems are, so maybe I'm bringing/rostering 1-2 Resto and 1 Feral Bear-Resto(0/30/21). If I'm an Alliance guild I have 3-4 Druids in my raid/roster. 1-2 Resto, 1 Feral Bear-Resto(0/30/21, maybe 0/31/20), and 1 Feral Cat(14/32/5). 
---
Leader of the Pack is a great buff even though in Classic/Vanilla it was only 3%, this can be great in a melee group or helpful for overall raid DPS early on in progression when your tank is spec'd + geared towards more avoidance(lots of +def, +dodge, +block, +parry) but lacking gear in a lot of offensive categories(+str, +agi, +crit, +hit). That phase of gearing can last much longer than most people think, 2-4 drops per boss in Classic for 40 people makes for a lot of farming.
---
Why would I bring a Feral Bear-Resto(0/30/21) to a raid all the time? 
---
Horde: It gives you another tank that doesn't share loot with warriors(Plate, shields, weapons, T1/T2) and will allow everyone to gear up faster. They are excellent trash tanks, good OTs during most raid encounters, and later on can MT certain(not all) bosses in every raid instance. When they're not tanking they can function as good healers down ranking Healing Touch, so just like a Warrior they will need multiple sets of gear to benefit the raid.
---
Alliance: All those reasons above apply to Druid and would add that even though Salvation is benefited greatly Allliance side Horde tanks generally have better TPS(threat per second) as they get Shaman totems. Druid TPS is amazing and they are the best trash tanks especially with trigger happy  DPS(Ranged pre-casting on pulls, Rogues with big openers). 
---
Why I would bring a Feral Cat Druid for LOTP to a raid all the time?
---
Horde: Probably wouldn't? Shaman totems are just much better and if you're lucky enough to find a good player who is willing to spec into improved totems, totem twist Windfury-Grace of Air, and wear a Nightfall Axe I don't see a point in bringing the Cat. Shadow Priest/PI-Shadow Weaving will trump the Cat based on how many Warlocks you run Horde side iirc.
---
Alliance: 3% Crit is 3% crit at the end of the day and every melee/hunter group will want you, every mana user will want your innervate, and your Battle Rez can save a wipe. LOTP is great for enhancing DPS for a single group or raid DPS being slotted into the tank group(increase in TPS). Yes the Druid must be well versed in powershifting plus wear a level 40 Blue helm for their entire duration of Vanilla but they decided to fill this role and those are the requirements. This is a support class Alliance side where Alliance doesn't really have many options. While progressing the more class balance/diversity you have the better, adding another class where you already have a lot just makes it harder to gear up. Alliance side melee you're going to see more Humans(Sword/Mace Racial) this time around so Swords are going to be hard to come by, personal experience I saw more Bindings drop than CTS's, and 2H'd Fury doesn't really work as well Alliance side sadly. Gearing up a Cat Druid is actually very easy as you will be invited to a lot of 5 and 10 mans to tank, heal, or DPS so it is advised to have multiple sets of gear and a lot of willingness to do what is best for the group to get you all the gear you'll need. If you enjoy PVPing when the rank 10 set comes out is very good especially since you can ride that 2 Piece bonus for a very long time. Finally another very good OT for trash.
---
I see Apex is at the point where people think it's cool to hate on it all ready lmao
---
His call out was wondering why some of the prominent content makers weren't debunking false information about Classic, but then again at least the current content makers have the mind about them not to specifically debunk things they aren't actually familiar with.
---
Stop shaming dwarven females ffs, they are beautiful in their own way.
---
Sure, Would be great but i dont think so. Blizzard not really beliving in Classic. They do it because of often interessed and pserver but i think they totally underestimate the whole Classic Project.
---
I believe it used to be possible to somehow be in combat with one of them, but not the other. The way i would go about this, in general. Is to pull a pack of mobs with the hunter, and have the pet attack one of the mobs, then the hunter feigns death. That way, only one mob has aggro on the pet, and the hunter dropped aggro. Splitting the group.
---
The change in 1.9 likely made it so that engaging combat with one, also caused aggro to the other mob.
---
Wow, very convincing reply!
---
I sold my first account a few months into TBC. It's very tempting to recover it but I struggle with the morality of it.
---
This happened to me. I was young. Stupid. I bought an account for a T2 warlock just before TBC launched. I didn't care for the lock but instead made a warrior that I played all through TBC. 
---
One day, probably around wrath but I can't remember, I got kicked off the account. Tried to log in, but my information didn't work. I tried going on the website only to see the same message. I concluded that the guy who sold me the account took possession.
---
I still miss that warrior to this very day.
---
Just as convincing as his statement
---
19 days played to get to level 60 sounds about right with paladin.
---
At this point in time a "WoW 2" wouldn't be possible. The trust in Blizzard is pretty much broken and they'll have to recover before they could use the IP for a possible new engine WoW 2.
---
Furthermore, what would be different? Right now Blizzard appears to be pretty much out of ideas on how to improve WoW. They are kind of driving it against the wall. 
---
Classic is a way for Blizzard to get back players they have lost over the years. Potentially bringing in new players to the IP as well. At this point in time  a true "WoW 2" would be something like 10 years away. First, they'd have to let WoW die and then they'd need to let the classic thingy die. Because these things CAN NOT live together, they just can't.
---
And Kevin Jordan and Mark Kern are working on a Game of Thrones mmorpg sinceramente 2014
---
Windfury is the single greatest gaming mechanic I have ever experienced.
---
I highly disagree
---
You know, I normally don't enjoy just shitting on someone...
---
...But this time I actually thought it was pretty well done. You back up your arguments well, and you're right: that guy is talking about something he doesn't know about. In that case, I feel like it's warrented. You gotta shut that down hard. Misinformation sucks.
---
That said, I recognize that others might feel differently. To each their own. Personally, I quite enjoyed the video. Looking forward to seeing more!
---
Not true, I fell for it one time.
---
Does it matter? If a WoW 2 is anything like retail why would Classic make me wanna play it?
---
If you really want to optimize in PvP, should buy a real mount when you can. Or get the R11 one.
---
Did you, by any chance, take a single peek at the video?
---
&gt;How was your warrior in world pvp?
---
I lost very few battles in WPvP.  I'm quite good at attacking before people realize I'm there and escaping heavy CCing classes like frost mages by using mobs as weapons against them. Warrior charge is just such a great opener when people don't expect it.  World PvP with a warrior was quite fun.
---
&gt;Why was it more fun than in BG's?
---
People who are ready for warriors in BGs can after kite warriors to death, which isn't fun.  I'm one of the few warriors who could solo beat a hunter in a kite fight but it wasn't easy, but frost mages would have field day with me. Most fights devolved into multiple people attacking me, which as a warrior without a pocket healer isn't fun.
---
&gt;And what warrior spec did you play?
---
Arms.
---
Remember how Vanilla launched and there was Collector's Edition with ingame pets for everyone who bought one? Also Blizzard these days tends to add ingame bonuses for their other games with purchase of Deluxe. That's what I meant.
---
Correct, pally mounts come with training. lvl 40 mount+riding is the cost of the ability. Pretty nice.
---
Well no, it's literally rule #1 but fuck the rules I guess.
---
&gt;Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic. This is not a community for private servers
---
Not sure about shamans, but ret paladins benefit greatly from flasking. Their dps is limited by their mana pool, the more mana they have available the more they can use their expensive, higher-dps rotations.

Congrats, you're just as bad as the guy who you thought left a bad comment. Really setting the bar high for yourself.....
---
Or perhaps you never played a server at launch. The economy isn't healthy enough to sell the mats you gather for much gold in the beginning. Even if you get lucky mining, arcane crystals aren't worth that much until there's a large population of 60's with high crafting professions and good recipes.
---
I am in the exact same boat. Sold it over Craigslist to some girl.
---
That’s fine man, your replies aren’t really adding much value to the convo either.
---
It's big dick tanking.  I have a small dick.  So this what I must do.
---
BUT THE LOOK IS SO BIS
---
It's unclear whether hunters will be able to solo Dire Maul North. Mages are better on private servers in Dire Maul due to custom changes made to prevent hunters from doing this.
---
My buddy did the same. He never played wow again.
---
I'm planing on rolling an undead priest and I really don't like their mounts. Sure 40 I will get a horse but I would much rather have a raptor. So you are saying there is an easy way to farm rep for trolls?
---
That said in classic I farmed for the winter spring epic mount that was a fucking chore for 14 year old me. I only did it because you could have the same tiger as a pet (I was a hunter) so it looked soo cool when you were Mounted and had the exact same tiger as your pet beside you. When I finally did it I was so happy.
---
Not soon after there came a patch that made your pet disappear as soon as you mount since they occasionally would bug out and not follow you correctly while riding. I was super pissed. All this time farming for the mount for this specific reason and then they removed this exact feature. Still makes me angry haha
---
Ölli
---
Zero. At no point in classic should a healer be dpsing.
---
That seems great, you've lessened my worries a bit. I really want to play warrior but I was always worried about pvp because I hear a lot of people saying warrior is garbage without a pocket healer. I'm fine with playing warrior if it can do fine in wpvp like you said.
---
For me back in the day, I loved all the classes but would get bored pretty quickly. Druid was  perfect because I could have any playstyle whenever I wanted. I had self heals, I had stealth, I had on demand mobility... I was sold.
---
Simple kids we were back then
---
 Shagu said that he won't port it to Classic last I checked :(
---
The look is outrageously insane +1
---
In 5mans if the group is solid then you will have plenty of time to dps for a large portion of every instance. Most instances only have a handful of difficult pulls anyway. Bosses can be a bit too spikey in damage to risk going hard on unless your tank is overgeared. 
---
As someone who tanks a lot I can tell you that I actively court healers who know the limits well enough to dps. It's surpringly rare and I greatly dislike watching healers stand around with plenty of mana baby sitting me at 80%+ hp.
---
* Hunters could [solo DM:N](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXE_RR5XzE8&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLaWLJ5UhLSSLv-Z7pK7XO8QbZ6L6sLdnk) in 2006. [WCM link](https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=27092)
---
* Hunters found a workaround on pservers but it's much harder to pull off.
---
I remember a few of op areas gnomes can go in WSG, like under the horde catapults and a couple other places. Downside is they cannot do some of the wall hops, like on the Alliance fence in certain spots, so bringing some savoury delights are helpful for chasing
---
That's pretty badass. :) Grats on getting your paly back.
---
Yeah that free mount thing is overrated haha the first one at level 40 is a spell that you get but the epic one... with the quests, the crafts, the money... we're pretty much on the same level as others. The pally epic mount does look very beautiful though :)
---
What route should I take as an elf?
---
Teldrassil
---
Darkshore
---
Ashenvale
---
Stonelaton mountains
---
Desolace
---
Etc or move to the PvP Madness duskwod/STV/hillsbrad after darkshore?
---
I feel the same way. At least for the first month, I expect a lot of hype around it. And as a regular Twitch viewer, I am excited to see everyone talk about Classic and play Classic.
---
Character sheet looks nothing like that either, this is either an ancient ss or OP is full of shit.
---
I once had the pleasure of doing a dungeon with a rogue who was "dodge-tanking". I have no idea how that works, or what he was doing, but it did happen.
---
There were people like me who would reset the dire maul instance repeatedly and mine the nodes over and over again. I doubt that bug will exist on a blizzard server.
---
This is either MoP or WoD but this couldve been avoided if date was added to title
---
You must be here from after the Pristine Black Diamond drop rate increase. That shit alone was 1k when I was getting mine.
---
I don't think that will be a problem with the majority of people planning on lvling pali. Everyone who is new to classic won't realize how painfully slow it is leveling a Paladin. Slowest second to Warrior imo.
---
I hate all Battle Royale games equally. I am an equal opportunity hater.
---
Dude, you've spun a terrifying idea of how vanilla was. Now I hope you play launch so you can see how quickly you're proven wrong.
---
thats why they ask the playerbase. New original content added to vanilla is the way to go.
---
Haha sick burn!
---
Who would not use addons?
---
F
---
This is just misinformation. Even hitting all the 55+ zones you will likely run out of quests and be forced to grind the last 1/2 level to 1/4 level at 59. 
---
Nobody skips these zones and saves them for gold at 60, you need the exp badly.
---
Trinket is shit. Ye its a one of a kind, but you're never gonna use it much. It will collect dust in the bank, while Soul Harvester is actually decent
---
No-one has said that, ever
---
"Server option"? Not sure what you mean.  It'll be a separate game, so there is a chance of them adding a Deluxe version with ingame bonuses.
---
&gt;  You gotta shut that down hard. Misinformation sucks.
---
That "Was Old Naxx Really That Hard?" video has been used many times over the years as a primary source when people talk about this. It has influenced many peoples' impression of what it was like. And it's from a guy whose guild apparently didn't even see C'Thun and killed 3 Naxx bosses.
---
Not sure about alliance, but I tend to stick to zones close to a capital city. I try to avoid places like The Badlands at all cost.
---
However places like UnGoro are great even though they are far.
---
Good call maybe orc hunter. I like that.
---
We minecraft now
---
It's 1.12. 
---
Sithilis has maybe 2 quests there
---
Healers in WoW classic need not dps. 
---
If it’s trivial, you could swp a mob that’ll be up for 18s or more or smite/holy fire one that is up shorter. But your primary function is healing. Especially prior to 60 when you’ve got gear, wasting mana and gcds on dps can lead to people getting killed. 
---
In 5 man content, I judge my healer based on us not dying, and his mana never (or as infrequently as possible) hitting 0–so that we can chain pull. Your mana as a healer is the only thing preventing the group from moving faster—if you’ve got 60% mana, I’m pulling. If you would have had 60% but now have 30% cause you spent that mana on dps, we now have to wait for you to drink, since your a healer, you dps to mana ratio is poor. 
---
If the choice is between you spending mana on dps for a 2 god earlier kill but needing to drink after, or you not dpsing and pulling the next pack immediately you should always go with the latter. If you can do both—fuck it do both. But don’t slow down the group.
---
You only need honored, so the 10% discount would def be there.
---
Judging from pservers, arcanite bars usually go for 25g/each early on. So we'd be looking at 150g from arcanite bars. 
---
Or roughly 450g vs 900g. So that's half price. Not to mention that you don't have to get your level 40 mount, so that's another 90g saved. If you're not wasting your gold on skills you wont use when you level, you can typically hit level 60 with around 350-400g. And that's taking into account the 90g you spent on your lv 40 mount. 
---
So a Paladin should be able to hit level 60 and get their epic mount immediately.
---
That said DM is being delayed so might not be worth waiting for if you're a super serious player.
---
By the time you hit 60 without entering a 50+ zone AQ 40 will be out
---
Was beautiful. A few memes aren't enough to take away from 26+ min of well reasoned arguments.
---
The world would be a boring place if everyone followed the rules.
---
Nah man they said it’s a server option. It’s not a complete re-release of the game you can buy. The way we will play it is just by re-subbing. I seriously doubt there will be any deluxe stuff.
---
Well it would. Nobody would force you to copy to the TBC server.
---
Another thing to remember, is a person can only have one blessing from you at a time. So let's say a furry warrior is about to pull aggro. When you put Salv on him it'll remove your blessing of might as well. So you get the 30% PLUS what ever the might was adding to his damage.
---
Ya I always preferred SW though. The look and feel resonated with me I guess. I’m a human IRL so maybe that’s why
---
I came at with an elitist 2006 attitude. Would you prefer the same video with memes taken out instead?
---
Well if it was up to me, I'd milk the cow dry, so I wouldn't exclude it. But if there isn't I'll have more for the sub ;). Also could you please pass me the link to them talking about it being server option? Thanks.
---
Agreed. Previous iterations were much longer, I could've rambled on for a lot longer.
---
Level 40 mount was just a spell at level 40 like any other spell. Call it about 1 gold. Not free, but compared to the level 40 mounts other classes (with exception of warlocks) quite cheap. Additionally, the paladin and warlock mounts, both regular and epic, didn't take up bag space.
---
Thanks! I trued using a Paul Joseph Watson style I saw online once. I'm normally a nice person, really, but him talking out his ass on Naxx really made my blood boil.
---
Yeah, and suffering through the pain of waiting for another 4 hours. 😂
---
I don't know details about the implementation of the game, but I can imagine that there is a place where the drop chances are configured. Seems to me that you could update it as soon as the item drops, in order for the change to be visible across all servers. 
---
Now, it could be a problem to trigger the update upon looting, but since there are achivements related to looting, it could be as simple as adding another listener to the looting event.
---
Regarding the server, well... No server would be chosen a priori. All players in all servers would have a chance to loot the item, and as soon as the first one does it, it's gone.
---
From ALL servers that is.
---
Eh I just like memes. When I sent this to people for feedback it was similar to here, half liked them, half said too many memes. Future videos would be elitist still but not directed at someone.
---
Agreed on the pserver community. Once I get more information about the pserver raiding scene I'd love to make a comparison video of the two.
---
The more I think about this, the more probable it sounds.
---
It would basically be the only way to integrate retail and classic players under 1 umbrella going forward.
---
Easy now fan boy, take a step back. I’m not saying he’s not a good content creator, Hell this could be the best damn video on YouTube. I just associate the massive obnoxious click bait arrow with things like “Pokimane did WHAT on stream??” Or maybe “Ninja is a GOD” with maybe a picture of shroud clapping for him? Era of click bait is just annoying.
---
sorry this thread for staff users only
---
Can I get a tldr of the video?
---
Was NAX actually hard? I have some concerns that the content will be too easy.
---
And a meteor just happened to hit the southern most continent of Azeroth, unbeknownst to the horde and alliance, killing off any  and all would-be inhabitants (pandas)
---
I take it that you don't know how to get a free soul shard out of it. 
---
It can be pretty clutch.
---
Skip the first 6min and the memes are diluted. I go more into detail about certain topics like Frost Resistance Gear, consumables, etc.
---
You will want to make sure you get to whatever faction you're trying to farm as early as possible. In the old days I'm pretty sure your rep reward was diminished for being too high of a level. 
---
So if you want a raptor mount, for example, you'd want to do as many Darkspear quests as possible. Once those run out though there's only the cloth repeatable and very minor gains in AV if I recall. So you might need to wait a couple content patches for those things to become available. Also forsaken start at Neutral with everyone else so that's another 3k to you'll have to earn. It can be done though.
---
If there's other ways to earn rep I don't know them. Though there could be
---
Easy, make copied characters copy with only a very low amount of gold (let's say a 10g cap). People would probably try to transfer expensive stuff then, but that isn't gonna be of much use when the whole server has its economy set to almost 0. 
---
However, I'm not a fan of copying in general. Leveling in TBC was already very different compared to vanilla - people should have to level 1-70 instead of only 60-70. Just my opinion though.
---
Makes sense
---
If you run dungeons, gather ALL the quests for the dungeon
---
If I remember correctly, it was 100g for level 40 mounts so paying like 1g for it was basically free compared to other classes. You’re right about the epic charger for Paladins. It was far from free. The items were costly and the quest wasn’t easy.
---
The TLDR is pretty meme light for my tastes, but appreciated. Future videos will have wow specific memes, like this  [https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/388/361/531.jpg](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/388/361/531.jpg)
---
Rattlegore wasn't the problem, but if you had no decurse the quest event itself would wreck you completely.
---
Shaman, unless you want to cry every time you try to get into a raid.
---
Weapon skill suffers from diminishing returns significantly. The first +5 is the most valuable. Which is why the racials are viewed as so important. Odds are if you get to 315, especially without help from a racial, you've given up other stats you shouldn't have.
---
I wonder if they'll have a way for people to get the CE pets in Classic. You can't really buy a special edition of it, right?
---
WoW2 would be miserable. This isnt 2004. WoW2 would have everything that's wrong with WoW now. Group finder to steamroll easy content, pigeonholed and defined roles. Arbitrary grind for the numbers. "Activities". The days of letting the players have choice are gone.
---
Recap at 26min where it is condensed.
---
It will be easier, because boss strats and mechanics are known. Doing bosses like the 4h and trying to figure out how abilities and their cooldowns worked was amazing, best part of my wow experience.
---
Don't suggest a bad leveling spot lmao
---
Butthurt
---
I’d say best guess is that we’re only going to get 1.12 items.
---
In a pserver I hit 60 without going to WPL, Silithus or Winterspring.
---
Dinged 60 in scholomance after doing a bit of questing in EPL. I also skipped out searing gorge completely, and only did parts of the steppes and barely any BRD quests.
---
Biggest change from vanilla on that server is the rested xp rate. I couldn't get normal, was always rested after level 45. But you can achieve that in vanilla as well, just with more offline time.
---
arent you a smart one
---
I am not only excited for classic wow. Which excites me even more is the people who are excited about people being excited for classic wow.
---
Ez with a healer and 4 CC as long as the do FF
---
But you cant mount in combat 🤔
---
I’m so confused. I remember doing these bosses in WotLK. Did they just mirror that raid? I started playing in TBC and quit in Cata
---
Soul Harvester every time purely for the look.
---
I didn't suggest a levelling spot I listed 50+ zones
---
Nope. Both factions have the same end game content. Alliance has more variability in low to mid level leveling. Horde has the Barrens. Both factions have their own issues.
---
Horde:
---
Orcs - Overly entitled idiots. "We were fooled by some bad people and destroyed our world and started a war with you and lost. You have to share your world with us. After all, we lost. And as for that wanting to kill or enslave the rest of you? That's no longer our official policy. But there are some of us who still want to."
---
Undead - "The same people who fooled the orcs created the Lich King who screwed us over. We want to take our revenge against the Lich King and while we're doing it, we don't care what happens to anyone else. Additionally, because we weren't accepted back by our original people after broke free of the Lich King, even though we were ravening blood thirsty monsters, we want to drag everyone else down to our condition. And by everyone, we mean EVERYONE."
---
Trolls - "We got help from the orcs in defending us against other troll tribes. We support the ~~Orcs~~ Horde."
---
Tauren - "We got help in pushing back the centaurs attacking us. We support the ~~Orcs~~ Horde."
---
Alliance:
---
Humans - We're mostly good. As long as our finances are stable. Otherwise, we might screw you over a bit.
---
Dwarfs - "Where did we come from? Gotta dig up places and find out. Meanwhile, pass me the ale."
---
Night Elves - "Bad stuff happened to us 10,000 years ago and those who did the bad stuff were strangers. We don't trust strangers.... or magic... Go away."
---
Gnomes - "What does this button do? Oops. How about that other button? Oops. Maybe that lever? Oops. How about ... ? Oops. ..."
---
It's true.  I remember this
---
Yeah I took this screenshot awhile back when I first recovered it. My current sub is canceled but I came across the screenshot today on my Facebook memories so I thought I would share it.
---
My guess would be that hunter pets do really bad aoe threat and Maraudon is filled with bigger mob packs.
---
I loved it. It was very refreshing to hear somebody just speaking blunt truth instead of weaving a story or pushing an agenda. But I'm a guy who listened to a super niche podcast in TBC from top-tier raiders and enjoyed that they spoke unfiltered about goods, bads, and reality. 
---
Most people are acclimated to soft fiction from the first television shows they watch so they're not going to be used to incisive call outs. This probably won't be a popular style for the masses but I tossed you a sub and will hope for more. There's definitely a market for this. 
---
Also, I appreciated the editing. You obviously took a lot of time to pick out clips and to hunt down 3rd party bits to insert.
---
Bruh at least he's not alex or metagoblin
---
raids were solable at 70 iirc
---
Yeah I prefer (I think there names are) Frostomundis, and MadSeason. Those guys make great classic content!
---
Is this supposed to prove me wrong? You had extra rested XP and did quests in several 50+ zones.
---
Dude holy shit, that Snide guy he talked about came into my guild to main tank and raid lead to teach us how to clear faster. This was months after what staysafe said he did. But he was such an asshole, it completely ruined raid nights for everyone I believe. I dont know why our guild leader kept him around. I dont even know why he wanted to raid with us.
---
I have two things I'd like to point out while watching videos like this one.
---
1) Server economy can differ a lot, it's not possible to say "these will sell for 2g" or "you will make 60g/hour if you do this". Some things will sell for 4g on one server, 6g on another and 1g on a third one, it depends on the market of the server you are on.
---
2) People will not have any gold for the first few months, so there wont be much of a demand for material, and when the demand will rise it will do so slowly since other players wont have much money to spend. Prices on mats for professions will be "like we remember them" way later, when the server community have more money as a whole. Farming like this will not give you much gold at the start of classic, which is something that I believe should be pointed out in the video, as it is now it is quite misleadning.
---
 If youre average you can have 100g by 40, how do you not have at least 200+ by 60?
---
The Soul Harvester will be replaced with another weapon. The trinket is a free soul shard to be used however you want to use it. Yes, it's a minor item, but it's usable no matter what level you are and will still be usable at 60. Rather annoyed that Blizzard nerfed it.
---
Stockades is easy enough, I healed a group of all wars/rogues and aggro was all over the place, so I'm assuming there was no tank in that group =p.
---
Classic announcement-States there is a server option
---

The latter will have a lot of info about classic. Can’t remember if they talk in depth in there. 
---
Sorry don’t have much more time to dig further
---
Would probably be better. Elitist attitude is fine, but the way you were doing it sounded too personal against hamster wheel to be honest.
---
Shhhhh
---
Thanks, i hate it.
---
Definitely, soloed much of MC with an elf Paladin
---
Yes. 
---
Alchemy is a good alt profession. Get a toon to level 35 and if you can win/afford flask recipes, which are not BoP in 1.12, send them to your alch alt. Otherwise, just buy the alchemy consumes you need with the surplus mats you get farming for your engineering mats (engineers don't need arcane crystals). 
---
Engineering is OP but you have to BE an engineer to use all the good stuff. You don't have to be an alchemist to use anything important from alchemy. Herbing is probably slightly more lucrative per hour farming than mining, but not at low levels, and DEFINITELY not if you're trying to level alch. You can keep engineering up to date for the entire leveling process quite easily with very little "extra" time spent farming mats, you get several useful items even at lower levels, it's just vastly better than having alchemy on your main. 
---
While nothing in the video is technically wrong, the reality of making money in vanilla WoW is what every goblin tells you- it takes time. There are no easy shortcuts. Whether it's time spent farming mobs/dungeons (for the classes that can do it well, such as aoe farming DM, soloing princess, or live strat orb runs), or collecting high-level herbs or minerals, the bulk of the money you can make in the game comes from spending time *playing the game*. Profit margins on crafting potions, even flasks, from materials you dont' farm yourself are slim. I'd estimate 95-99% of the raw value of a flask on any server with a healthy population comes from the herbs- i.e. if you can sell a flask for 100g, buying the mats on the AH is going to cost 95-99g. Same with stacks of mana pots, FAPs, or anything that actually sells in enough quantity to have a liquid market. 
---
Frankly even the time spent leveling an alchemist alt to 35 for arcanite transmutes is debatable, the time and cost of leveling an alt to 35 and getting alchemy trained to 300 is probably better spent just making money with your main. Don't do it unless you have loads of spare time and your guild is willing to give you flask recipes in return for your crafting stuff for them.
---
Wotlk was quite similar to naxx 40 in many ways except you had way better gear in wotlk even after just finishing the 5man dungeon process.
---
In Finland one guy actually took legal action when the original owner who had sold the account stole it back using the secret question, and won!
---
Oh i thought that rank books location merely got removed, coulda sworn it was in diremaul. I raided up to a few bosses in naxx bk, when on the young side but i do recall mate :P   
---
About a hunter? I see. So it might be worth enough to bring one feral along for the buff then? My guild never did have a feral back in the day. We had a SP, but thats about it. Is ret pala that bad on DPS? I was horde so.
---
Just have to be in the area
---
Hardcore =/= playing a lot.
---
Keep the memes, if you like them, but I just thought the name calling was a unnecessary.
---
There are tons of people asking, about raiding scene. I'm sure your perspective would be well received if you do it without trashing someone. I thought besides those points, the video was absolutely great and accurate.
---
Private servers
---
As others said, in vanilla healers are just for healing. Since the subscription covers both classic and retail, you may consider trying retail - there, healers are given tools to deal some damage instead of just heal
---
They either don't know or don't want to rock the boat causing friction between themselves.
---
up until two week ago we were going to remake the same characters. i was looking forward to doing this again. He decided to play a hunter now..
---
Extremely efficient speed levelers can get to level 10 in 1 hour and a half nowadays. Average players can be expected to take around twice as much.
---
Only new and slower players would take 6 hours to 10.
---
Lol call me dumb in first sentence then expect me to read long ass post. You're the dumb one.
---
And I'm fairly sure that the PvP discount is only on the mount, not the training. Which was nice during launch because then the mount cost 900g but they swapped close to the end of vanilla and then it's a much smaller discount.
---
I'm not sure what mounts will cost on Classic though.
---
Honestly I'd rather work overtime for an hour or two than to play bfa for 10 hours or whatever it takes to make enough gold for a token
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHdM6Kwgfj4
---
It's not misinformation. I've DONE IT. twice. in actual vanilla.
---
The ONLY way you need a 55+ zone is if you level 1-30 in same region. and then cannibalize your 30-40 quests to try and make up the difference you're missing. 
---
PRIOR to the 45+ zones being buffed.
---
most people wasted 10 levels worth of quest xp over the course of getting to 60 because of an outright refusal to visit other zones, until they ran out quests in their current region. Which was TOO LATE. You already lost all the experience because you waited too long.
---
well if you sold your account back in vanilla/tbc when it was good money, now the owner propably left the game and you can steal it back eith a national id
---
This makes me sad irl
---
But have someone in the party / raid actually deal any sort of damage to the target
---
Mine was when I was leveling a holy priest during TBC. Was in a group for Dead Mines and our tank was a complete and total idiot. We managed to get to the Foundry, whereupon the idiot would always over pull and we would wipe. He claimed that it was impossible to past there without having a level 40 escort us. The 4 of us would them tell him that it was possible and try again. Just after another wipe and corpse run, when we go back to the instance, we found everything respawned. Asked the tank and it turns out that he had reset the instance. We were livid, but soldiered on to the Foundry once again. And after we wiped again, we complained about the idiot once again over pulling and he finally gave up lead and quit the group. Since this was well before LFG existed, the 4 us chatted for minute or so and the other warrior volunteered to tank. The cockles of my heart were warmed when I saw him pull out a gun to do a single pull of one of the goblins. The 4 of us then proceeded to clear the rest of Dead Mines, including VanCleef.
---
Classic will probably be that wow2.
---
lmfao you're actually paying and playing bfa yet you call *us* braindead drones

Great idea - thanks! I just made a post about it.

What

Not longer than your post, double-dummy.

but i mean the original game xd
---
Same here. I started playing in April 05' and I don't think I even hit level cap until WotLK. (didn't play much during TBC tho) 
---
My gnome rogue (one of the first characters I ever made) is lvl 56 and has 28 days /played. I just spent so much time doing random shenanigans. My classic experience had no endgame at all
---
Sorry yes, mages occasionally have to worry about threat in the last tier of raiding that 5% of people get to.
---
Tbh, while grinding mobs I found it annoying that it broke mana regen.
---
You can still kill the King even when his healer is in combat as long as the king is constantly moving.
---
I can be wrong so please correct me if I am but I don't think over healing added threat, just life gained from a heal.
---
Said trinket isnt that useful tho
---
I think this is exactly what I was looking for - THANK YOU! I'm actually out of town for the weekend (thus the slow response) so I will see if this works when I get home. Hooray!
---
I'm confident in saying Blizzard will never make another MMO again. They don't have the expertise. They were making an MMO for along time, Titan, then they gave up and turned it into a lootbox online shooter. They make so much money from those lootboxes and from Hearthstone, why would they even want to invest in another huge project like WoW or Titan again (from an investors perspective)?

I'm going for Neretzek the Blood Drinker, with Lifestealing on it.

Just a coincidence, but the last 2 druids in my deadmine runs have been completely braindead.

The (verb) in (rogue, new, sadness, etc) meme has overstayed it’s welcome
---
You're full of shit, look at any levelling guide they all take you through dozens of zones across both continents and still you end up short on quests at the end. You don't have some hidden route that nobody is doing, everyone hits multiple zones and everyone ends up questing in 50+ zones to get to 60
---
PvP and PvE damage are basically completely different beasts. Hunters excell at doing damage while moving, have superiour range and mobility than other classes which is what makes them generally good as a PvP DPS. The way their ranged attacks work is that they have a timing window where they can move between shots and then a window where they have to stand still. They are much less static and manahungry than other ranged dps in PvP.
---
Now there are many other factors too. Their stings can't be used in raids but are very powerful in PvP. Their multishots actually hit multiple targets in PvP. They have tons of instant cast CC abilities (traps, intimation, scatter, proccs, wingclip, counterattack, concussive...) these really help them to keep shooting at something constantly.
---
I played vanilla at launch. Perhaps things will be different knowing some strategy, but I wasn't able to buy my regular mount until level 45. The majority of my friends didn't have epic mounts for at least a few weeks after we hit 60. I imagine that's going to be the case for a lot of casual players, however if you're planning on being decently hardcore about focusing on grinding for herbs/ore/cloth/leather I'm sure it's possible.
---
Screenshots.
---
I've only leveled a priest in Vanilla to 23 (saving the experience for Classic) but can confirm that  since level 8 (when I got a wand) I've literally stopped to drink while questing literally less than 5 times for the above stated reasons. I would expect this is a pretty consistent experience to 60?
---
It's been a long time since Vanilla launched. 100g by 40 wasn't as typical as you make it sound, but I guess we're not going to be new players anymore. The majority of Classic players will have plenty of experience on the AH and what to do to grind gold. It's feasible, but not probable that everyone will be able to shell out for their class epic mount right away.
---
Are you from Jimquisition? I read this in his shrill annoying voice and am convinced you’re him.
---
And yes owls are the "best" pet for screech but honestly any bird of prey with screech will do if you want the aoe taunt. For horde you can tame a lvl 16? Carrion in westfall which is fairly easy and it will have screech.
---
That's how it worked, however it was changed in BFA, so twinks are in full force again.
---
This quest gets added pretty late in vanilla by that point I was way past the stage of the weapon ever being relevant. The trinket can be useful for soloing dungeons tho so it's pretty neat I guess
---
Gotcha bro, I'm more of a goof-off myself so I just love the image of a Tauren or Gnome Warrior dual-wielding daggers while tanking.
---
No Changes
---
Fucks off in mate
---
Basically what you are saying is that you will try to start kiting them, but usually the tank will overtake the mob much faster than back in the day.
---
Not if you make "The TBC server" just Outland. 
---
Put all the amenities (AH, trainers, etc) in Shatt and so forth. There's no need for a portal back to Orgrimmar or Stormwind because you're not going back to Azeroth. You're here to enjoy the BC content.
---
If you want to do Karazhan, we'll put a portal directly into the first room in the raid. Other than that, if you want to leave Outland, you can do so on a different character.
---
I've read a hard no some places, other people are saying you can toggle updated/original character models. So far I haven't found any blue posts to confirm.
---
Wouldn't that allow people to buy gold on classic? Give me 100gold and I'll had you a wow token on bfa
---
1. abuse 5 second rule
---
2. get weapon with max +spirit and switch for it for mana regen when out of mana
---
3. switch for +spirit weapon for innervate
---
4. get plenty of mana potions and dark runes
---
5. for some hardcore mana regen might wanna buy Lei of Lillies (epic neck)
---
6. for some extra hardcore mana regen keep some Night Dragon's Breath
---
7. pop mana and dark runes as fast as possible, so they cooldown faster
---
8. time your inner focus for some 5-second rule profits
---
Everytime before I join a dungeon with my hunter friend I tell him this beforehand to "remind" him. It's a running gag between us.
---
I'd rather have one free inventory slot, than having this trinket occupy it.
---
But it all depends on which version of the trinket we're talking about. The nerfed or pre-nerfed one.
---
I believe there was a comment about there being updated screen ratios (i.e., you don't have to play a 1x1 box screen) so in *that* sense yes. But as far as update spell animations, character models, armor models, etc. - No, I believe they will be the same as far as I know.
---
try it some time. Level by zone level, not by region.
---
And I've read leveling guides. They play just like like the average person does, except they recommending grinding rather than questing in other zones in several parts.
---
Which isn't nessecary if you plan your route better to minimize backtracking. Since you only have to backtrack if you visit zones before you're supposed to level wise, barring basically STV which is meant to be twice. once at 36-41 and another 49-51
---
WoW2 could be such a different game it wont need lfr and such.
---
Priest was my main in vanilla. It was quite a while ago and I did a fair amount of dungeons, but as far as I remember front-load spells + wand = almost no drinking pretty much forever.
---
You think that if they were planning on doing some kind of bonus digital content that they wouldn’t have announced it at Blizzcon?
---
Sweet 🤙
---
This is what I thought, however some people have mentioned they would be running classic on the updated engine.
---
It's not really fair to say that they lost their passion for development.
---
Otherwise you could say the same about Indie Devs who more often than not
---
1. Release an unfinished product under the guise of Early Access (which they will most likely never leave)
---
2. Rarely do sales for their game, thus leaving an unfinished product at +30 Euro/Dollar at times
---
Most of them don't bother with unique/innovative games anymore, There was a time where being an Indie Dev meant creating unique games that AAA studios are too afraid of doing as it would mean stepping outside of their comfort zone.
---
Indie Devs are now seemingly making the same games with just different skins and maybe slight mechanical changes or as I like to call it: The Pac-Man Situation.
---
Back then there were dozen of Pac-Man versions for the Atari and other consoles, but did you REALLY need all of those? most of them were inferior to the original anyway and displayed huge flaws.
---
With that said, there are still plenty of decent Indie Dev's around that are worthwhile to support (Tynan's Rimworld for one) BUT don't blindly support them anymore.
---
My steam library is full of failed products and false promises from those "Passionate" developers and I learnt my lesson in that regard.
---
Demo had improved foliage, slightly different shaders and new water (3 different options + vanilla water). Also it had "Classic" button, by pressing it graphic looked the same as 1.12. No new models, no new animations were in the demo.
---
There will not be updated character models. The graphics are somewhat improved though -- there is widescreen support, increased ground cover, textures look a little sharper, and (optional) new water graphics. So it still looks and feels like the old graphics but with a little more fidelity at the highest settings.
---
OK, it just means they have tethered aggro. I was hoping that was the case.
---
The solo trib run I had seen involved kiting both, the wording on the patch just seems really fuzzy.
---
Not necessarily. They could wait till launch date announcement, and make it available for purchase then.
---
From the sound of it, I'm thinking you dont have a lot of people over for "movies"
---
Updated engine != updated graphics
---
Profession based grinding is always more g/h than vendor grinding. Maraudon solo farming is about 25g/h, DM tribute (not until phase 2) solo runs are about 50g/h, both of these numbers *only* apply if you are practiced and do them efficiently. Solo dungeon runs and vendor grinding in general is convenient, safe and a good fallback option.
---
But a higher income comes from killing/looting/gathering the right stuff at the right time and using the AH and the server evolution to determine that. These things are often heavily profession based. The best hunter option is *easily* skinning devilsaur leather, because of how early they can solo them, their tracking abilities, mobility and high dueling power in the open world.
---
Ok, thanks buddy. :) Have a good one.
---
Just keep making up bullshit and pretending you're better at levelling than everyone else
---
Healers in wow don't dps.
---
Bad healers might have issues with mana but if you're chugging mana potions on cd and using dark/demonic runes you should pretty much never run out of mana.
---
There are a lot of ways a good healer can distinguish them self, from showing off on healing meters to clutch saves.
---
Healers are ultimately the biggest carry in your raid. Your goal should be to reach a point where your output matches that of two healers. Once you reach this point you can start bringing less healers and more dps. This makes bosses die faster = less time in combat = less damage to heal
---
You're on this subreddit, so I asssume you live with a thirst for knowledge and meaning in your life.
---
Further, you are self-aware enough to think about analyzing his insult from HIS perspective. 
---
You definitely read his entire post.
---
Hunters don't fall behind mages until T2 and then only about 10%.
---
Just upset at fake news. Him being so smug certainly doesn't help
---
Something to get out of my system I think. Thanks for the feedback.
---
Adding tbc is a huge problem by itself, now you have 2 stagnating clients.  
---
  It reaches a point where the so called wall of no is actually true and full of valid points, they can't just re release every single expansion.
---
Those chances are very slim. Someone spending good money on an account probably played until they forced us to use Battle.net accounts during WotLK. And yes, it doesn't matter what personal details the original WoW account had, you could link it to any Battle.net account.
---
It's a good point, i just have a feeling that they are not prioritizing that as much.
---
Well that's Deadmines, literally everything is different after level 20; and by extension Deadmines. There is no way I'd ever heal a run until level 20 for Flash of Light; and it's practically mandatory to bring along one out of 8 possible classes as a DPS, (mage), else you're asking for a shit run.
---
When I first started my friends were alliance. One was a hunter the other a warrior. So I choose a gnome mage. I levelled to 60 as a fire mage and that was slow going but I loved it. I was screwing around for a bit at 60, but my friends didn’t play as much as me so I was bored. Turns out my brother and all his friends are playing on Shattered Hand as alliance and doing raids so I decided I to join them. 
---
My second and my longest played character was a Night elf Priest. I wanted to do more dungeons and try a completely different area to level in. After a while I did not much care for the casting animations.
---
Leveling was slow, but healing was fun and not very difficult. I raided holy in vanilla but only was able to fully clear BWL before BC was released.  In that time I was able to level a bunch of alts. I had 60 warrior who I used to farm. A 60 resto shaman on a different server to see what the Horde side was like, and was even able to raid ZG a few times.
---
For classic I am going to go Orc Warlock. Though, I am probably going to miss having the felguard do 90% of the work after lvl 40,
---
300g? I paid 600-700 for the mats when I got mine. Still less than 1000 (more like 900 with rep discount).
---
It is reasonable but weaker than BM before you have raid gear.
---
But is that fun and interesting? My first iterations were response video style and ending up being excessively long and just me rambling. Different stokes for different folks for sure
---
Keep in mind Dire Maul won't even be in at launch, so depending on when Phase 2 comes out you'll have some time to earn some gold.
---
Yes, it does. It also procs blackout.
---
I met a BiS shadow priest that could kill me without attacking as a rogue. He just spammed shadowguard and killed me that way with nothing I could do. I was by the time he was at half. (Nightslayer/bloodfang mix)
---
10/10 would watch again
---
Yeah, what u/habsfan03 said. I believe a good analogy might be a car? As in, if you put a new engine in a car, it wouldn't change the color of the paint, only how the car runs. Things like character models and Spell animations are assets. Based off the presentation at last Blizzcon they are *not* using the assets (such as character models) from the 7.x.x client, only the engine it runs on and are specifically using the assets from 1.12.
---
Eh, MoP and Legion had flaws but otherwise were pretty good. Cata had the Old World revamp on top of adding content for 80 - 85 and the 80 - 85 content was lacking as a result. WoD’s content was fine... and then you hit max level and found out they ran out of content. BfA has a lot of issues between titanforging, dumb story decisions, a seemingly indifferent staff handling balance, ect.
---

Went on Retro-wow private server and tried some classes out. Messed around with different builds and shit, and picked the one i had the most giggles with. Im a troll irl, so ofc i chose Rogue. I love to troll ppl as rogue, and if i get caught or is about to get fucked, and somehow escape with vanish or something - i turn into a overexcited 24y/o kid. 
---
I live in a flat with my girlfriend and because of little room, i play in the living room - so my girlfriend often looks at me like im retarded. But im having a fucking blast being a ingame troll.
---
So try out Retro-wow and try out classes, and pick what makes you happy.
---
Since this subreddit is "r/classicwow", it seems safe to assume it's the pre-nerfed one. The Abyss Shard was nerfed with patch 3.0.2 (WotLK). If it were the nerfed shard, I'd agree that the weapon is better. But then again, by level 60, both would have long since become vendor trash.
---
Every other hunter does this in wPvP on the pserver I play atm.
---
Hi, /u/JupitrominoRazmatazz
---
people downvoting like crazy just because some said it's from TBC. oh wow..
---
Absolutely get a Troll if you care mostly about min-maxing. Their racials are much more consistent for PvP.
---
Oh I meant like he. And recover his old acct, still have to pay the sub
---
Im also pretty  sure you default to warmode being off
---
They aren’t planning in having the Token on Classic, so nope. It’s staying on retail, but because Classic and Retail share a sub fee you can pay for both with the token.
---
For playstyle changes AND raiding mechanics or just playstyle changes?  It will be interesting to see who will neglect helpful addons that are raid mandatory vs just fun helpful addons for ui changes or material help
---
Quest regarding Classic/Retail sub.. do I need to have purchased BFA as well to play Classic? Or just have a subscription? Thanks!
---
How is spell hit and spell damage irrelevant? I thought those were two of the highest stat priorities for warlocks?
---
My memory of vanilla (never played pservers) is that BM is only viable as a leveling spec and nothing else. Bestial Wrath doesn't enrage the player, only the pet, in vanilla. BM as a spec for anything except leveling up only became a thing in TBC onwards.
---
Eh, just keep denying the truth, if that's what you have to do make yourself feel better.
---
But you're still wrong. I'm still right, and surprisingly number of people who actually bothered to check, know I'm right.
---
BUT..as mentioned it's not the FASTEST way to level.
---
Should bring less healers then!
---
When I tried to look it up, there only seems to be guaranteed nodes behind one of the last bosses in the east wing that you have to kill. Did you need a certain class to get through to that point or was it just bugged to not need to kill the boss or something?
---
I'll add that even if this were a thing, you would be a 20 twink in a 29 bracket - where as in retail they are leveled and gear scaled to 29, meaning they retain most of thier OP stats. 
---
Also lacking newer skill ranks would also set them back further on the power curve.
---
Plus they will be grouped with paying account 29 twinks who would stomp them out regardless.
---
9 levels behind, 9 levels of gear behind, 9 levels of skills and skill ranks behind - pretty much just crutching on enchants and engineering - and still having to fight other twinks with that much more of an advantage?
---
I don't think it will be as big of an issue as you were thinking.
---
Doesn't get added until patch 1.8 if you're a raider you should have much better by than
---
This mentality would really only work on a PvE server in my opinion. With the way WoW culture is, you'd be losing levels and loot faster than gaining it once you get to STV / Thorium Point.
---
I believe they said they would allow people to toggle between modern graphics and original graphics client side
---
As long as you can keep cc you can do it, even some 60's dungeons if tried enough. I tanked lbrs as priest with mc up to spiders without tank
---
“and culture/gender/race-war political ideology has infested their workforce.”
---
Excuse me... what the fuck is this? Lol.
---
I think you’re just being a drama queen at this point. You got your answer as far as what the downsides are, move on.
---
Troll is the way to go if you can stand the looks.
---
I got that reference!
---
dots don't get any benefits from haste in vanilla
---
In battlegrounds, specifically. 
---
That doesn't meet 20 twinks can't run around camping others around Azeroth.
---
I used to play F2P 20 twink back in Cataclysm, and there was huge gaps between level 20 F2P twinks and 24 P2P twinks, yet that didn't stop hundreds to thousands from playing the bracket.
---
Don't do it to yourself man, it is rewarding but hard task to get used to intricacies of class if you're just starting.
---
It’s annoying as a lock because it’s nice to lifetap and then immediately mount. With the class mounts you need to wait 1.5 sec for the GCD, with a vendor mount you don’t have to. I used vendor epic mount and r11 pvp mounts in vanilla and have done the same on various private servers and will be doing the same in classic.
---
Found the warlock.
---
&gt;do I need to have purchased BFA as well to play Classic? 
---
no.
---
"free epic mount"
---
I'll take "Things nobody ever said" for $2000, OP.
---
I mean thats a pretty fast recharge lol.
---
I've never, ever had 100g at level 40 without stopping quests and intentionally grinding for gold.
---
So I tossed this idea around with another really knowledgeable warlock recently. The staff is pre-bis until you pick up a main hand from MC, provided you have a decent offhand. Obviously it has +hit which is huge for early raiding.
---
I never saw the value of the trinket, despite what everyone said about it. I’ve just never played in a way that I needed to use it, so I’ll probably go Soul Harvester.
---
Also, BIS looks.
---
Well we still need them majordomo, raggy, chrom and nef. But we've recently let a few priests (me included) to equip dps gear on the fights where less healing is needed. With our retri in the group boosting holy damage we actually do some half-decent dps. Not even close to the main dps classes, but maybe 70% or so. Might as well dps rather than just stand around throwing a heal once in a while.
---
There won't be any new models, new spell effects, new combat animations.
---
But the water could be updated because engine. Everything else will be the same.
---
Why is the an alliance majority? Is it due to popular twitch streamers or raid preference?
---
Agreed.
---
TBC fresh server down the road if they do TBC it would be the best bet. It does bring its own problems but still.
---
I don't get the "free soul shard" replies. The trinket takes a bag slot (assuming you don't keep it equipped at all times). You could just as easily fill the bag slot it would otherwise take up with another soul shard. Or you could use the bag slot for something that's actually useful.
---
I recently healed as a lvl 18 paladin, which went very smooth, but we had a group of 20's otherwise, and a good mage for sheep vs the goblins etc.
---
Once you get into ZG spell hit gets some serious help. The single point of spell hit doesn’t stand up to the raw boost from the Azuresong Mageblade and an offhand, or the staff of dominance from MC.
---
If it’s added phase 1, it’s pre-BIS till you replace it in MC.
---
Yea but if the token works for both then you can technically sell them on classic, cant you?
---
Of course you'd need the element of trust, but you prove you have the token on retail, trade the gold on classic, then trade the token back on retail
---
Agreed. Never really used it. If the staff is available phase 1, I’m taking it.
---
I know I can't stand how trolls look I feel like slapping them whenever i see one drinking some juju milk... undead looks cooler... but I want to 1 vs 2 or 1 vs 3 people in world pvp so I want the best racials  for it. Btw, i got one question about vampiric embrace does it actually heal a shadow priest a lot for full 25% of damage done? Or, is it more comparable to earth shield or equivalent to an improved drain life as a warlock?
---
Iv'e always wanted to play a class that can heal through damage so I was wondering if vampiric embrace is the best ability out there for it. Iv'e seen warlocks can self heal too through damage but I assume shadow priests are the best class at doing that. Or am I wrong? :o
---
The rep you get from quests doesnt change due to level, but the problem is that trying to hit exalted with thunderbluff or darkspear is significantly harder due to the amount of quests dedicated for those factions, on the other hand reaching it with forsaken can be easier, and with orgrimmar is a walk in the park.
---
Ty! Wasn't sure.
---
It's not hard to tune the mobs like that, but getting T3 is a colossal time investment and if you can skip it by just questing in a 5-man group pulling one mob at a time, people will do that instead of going through 3 tiers of raiding.
---
Raids can only be tuned the way they are because they're fixed size, this concept doesn't work in a setting where you can bring more people to make things easier.
---
There are a couple videos on the Classic WoW demo graphics.  
---
https://youtu.be/nVDhZ2YU9Cs
---
Seems like it has dynamic shadows, increased foliage density and foliage rendering distance, and the new water effects. All of the above can be disabled.
---
I think that's why I'm kinda confused. I mean the quest is available at 50ish? If it's pre raid BIS that's amazing and for a long time. I guess part of me kinda assumed most of this stuff will be in, but we really haven't gotten a clear picture on how itemization will work. Have to wait and see :(
---
He is absolutely correct though lol
---
Get proc. Kill mob. Mount.
---
There's no way \*I'd\* ever heal a run until level 20.
---
Or if they hard reserved Smite's Hammer for me, obviously.
---
Good luck getting an auto attack proc within the last 6 seconds of combat
---
So, he came there to teach how to clear faster and at the same time was shaming you for being "Fresh cucks"?
---
Smite's hammer was mine, so I had to go :)
---
I had 22 days with my first char (mage). Then again I remember doing ALOT of things that didnt gain me any exp whatsoever. Like participating in the TM-SS brawl when I was level 45, or wallclimbing in Ashenvale and Searing Gorge. Ah, good times.
---
The sub for wow is linked between classic and retail. 
---
that gives me a "legal" way to trade gold though. since I have gold cap on retail, I'll just be able to pay for people's subs in exchange for gold on classic.
---
Once you get t2 3set bonus, priest become a different class sortof. cos you start regening so much while casting (combines with talent). so play style changes abit also, class feels differently aswell.
---
But generally speaking, you just abuse 5 seconds, be intact with regen ticks, and precast-&gt;cancel all the time. so you can heal most efficiently and so you wont overheal and regen as much as you can, when its not needed, while at the same have stuff under control. being good priest is all about mana management and conservation, while keeping everyone up and healing at the same time.
---
haha i recently went to a private server to test up to lvl 20 and tanked deadmines. that part was alot harder then i remembered. we wiped a time or two but we were all having alot of fun because it was more challenging. hunter would shoot one mob and kite it up the stairs. SOO much better then retail when you can grab the whole room in heirlooms and not be concerned about dying.
---
So long as a Paladin got it, and not a dirty Warrior.
---
The mace has a high enough procrate with SoR that it should be happening fairly frequently. In any case I get the sense that you are just here to argue for sake of arguing and you are contributing nothing to this thread.
---
Not sure how you can get 450g during lvling unless you were doing a lot of grind during 1-60 on profitable spots and selling stuff on AH.
---
No need to buy anything, just a sub and you can play both versions with it.
---
Retail became so lopsided because the game became an easy mode solo grind and there was little to no reason for having even a single opposite faction player seeing BGs and Arena were cross-server anyway.
---
Classic will have it's side balance issues but this is offset by those wanted to actually do BGs ... and they won't launch if your faction greatly outnumbers the other. I've seen entire guilds change sides in retail Classic because of this.
---
You can still raid fine if your faction is 50% smaller than the other, but BG's launching 2-5 times more is one hell of a reason to stay on that side. If cross server BGs enter Classic, we'll have to see how this impacts faction balance.
---
Shadowguard will proc (use a charge) regardless of the source of damage that you're taking (melee, ranged, spell), however once a charge is consumed, there is roughly a 3sec "cooldown" before Shadowgaurd can use another charge. Shadowguard's damage will scale with your character's spell power and talents. As it is considered shadow damage, each charge consumed has a chance to proc Blackout if you're spec'd into it, as well as heal you for a % of the damage done if you have Vamp Embrace on your target, as well as proc Shadow Weaving.
---
Berserking affects your casting speed only, it does not accelerate the ticks of any DoT's you apply, nor does it lower the internal cooldown on your Shadowguard charges. So spells like SWP, Vamp Embrace, Bubble which are all instant-cast will never, in any way, receive any bonus with Berserking active. Spells like Mind Blast, Mind Flay, any healing spell with a cast time...those can all have their cast times shortened by berserking.
---
Keep in mind that Shadowguard can be dispelled off of you by any class that can dispel magic, so in reality in most organized/group PvP scenarios...your perfect plan of getting all these procs and stuff isn't like some 1v1 duel.
---
Will of the Forsaken is ultimately what causes some horde Priests to roll Undead, as it is quite strong.
---
I have played both a Troll and an Undead priest on the horde side, and found them to be quite comparable, and at the end of the day...the best advice I can give you is to pick the race you think looks better, and adapt accordingly with your racials.
---
If you seriously think you're going to run a 3 hour BRD without taking a break you are insane
---
Super low level mats like copper and linen only "sell well" for maybe the first month or so of a server. After that they drop off sharply and don't really sell for much of anything.
---
When it comes to "low level" items making lots of gold, they have to be things that are useful at max level, like Elemental Fire/Earth, Grave Moss, etc.
---
I would like a WoW 2 that was made with the design philosopy of vanilla/tbc. However Ion has said on stage at blizzcon that we have atleast 10 expansions (9 after BfA) to go, **atleast** implying that even if popularity drops even more than BfA we will see more expansions.
---
However anything said during blizzcon I think is not a guarantee, so lets say Classic is a major success. I and many others will be redeemed in our thoughts and voices, blizzard will see the potential customers they can get from actually making a good MMORPG again and we might just see a WoW 2
---
First, I'm not the smoker, so stop saying "your"  
---
Second, in the original scenario we are already past the group forming stage. This argument has been about learning the reason for the afk at the time that the afk happens. If I knew he was a smoker ahead of time, I'd take that into consideration upon bringing him. He'd have to be slightly more skilled than others to earn the invite.  
---
So you haven't really addressed the scenario. Which is, do you replace a smoker, or do you put up with him, upon learning that he's a smoker somewhere during the run?  
---
If the run has already started and you're inside the instance, you're saving more time by just letting the dude smoke.  
---
If you replace the smoker, the only way it would be more efficient is if you literally have a replacement party member on standby AND right outside the very instance you're doing.  
---
Anything else and you're wasting everyone's time.
---
I think you greatly underestimate how long it can take to get a good weapon in Vanilla. Potentially it may take you months.
---
The Harvester is not a bad pick, and lets be real, do you REALLY need that one extra soul shard from the trinket? It's on a 30min cd and it takes up a bag slot which you could have used for... drumroll.. Another soul shard.
---
You have to wait several months in IMO for low level mats to be valued, because early on, everyone is poor, and most people are around a similar level bracket.
---
Wow so assuming, i actually really like the weapon and intend on buying the first one i see on the auction house, i just doubt that the stars will allign often enough to be that consistent for mounting up
---
If this quest is in the game from the start, then Harvester is the obvious choice. Hit gear wont be easily available for a loooong time with their current timeline.
---
You're soloing a lower level instance for fun and profit. You don't have any soul shards and unfortunately you'd like one so you can summon your VW to tank for you. And gee, the mobs around you are too low level for you to get a soul shard. What are you going to do?
---
Most pservers that I've played were very close to 50/50, with alliance being the slightly bigger half of the population
---
Thanks for this!  Makes navigating between different filters really quick and easy to compare--
---
Interesting to see the inverse correlation between private server use and expected time to 60 in Classic. (To recreate: Look at private server use chart and select the various time to 60 filters and see how it changes.)
---
People who have not played on private servers it would seem want to take their time playing / be more casual in classic.  ...Or maybe are simply overestimating how long leveling to 60 actually takes, ala believe the hyperbole about how long it takes.  
---
Great tool! Thanks!
---
Maybe they're developing some new project that's expected to be big but I don't expect it's going to be WoW2 yet. We can only wait and see I guess.
---
The Pally Mount sucks ass. Not only does it cost a lot of Gold and the Quest is annoying as fuck, its also a Spell, requires Mana and you can get silenced while trying to mount!
---
That is in lbrs
---
For an isolated example and considering that you can't swap pets in the field, an unrealistic one as well.
---
Exactly. And in order to use the trinket, you need it equipped, so that means you probably have a different trinket with spell power, crit or whatever that you have to take *out* in order for Abyss Shard to go in, losing those stats as well.
---
Don't take the abyss shard. Ever. It's absolutely not worth it. If they changed it to "Summon voidwalker with no cooldown" instead of no mana or no soul shard, it would actually be worth something.
---
no
---
&gt;In my personal opinion this type of gear goes against the entire vanilla philosophy.
---
If they added catchup gear for every slot id agree with you, but as it stands the "catchup" gear in Vanilla are sidegrades at most, mean to fill your slots in case players have bad RNG with drops.
---
Catchup gear just isnt good enough to replace raiding gear in most cases, and it wouldnt make sense to have players starting really late in the game have no access to any gear better than what players that began playing day 1 had, because those players would never get to see the inside of a raid as there would just be a lot more better geared players to pick from.
---
Catchup gear is a good feature, as long as its not overdone like they started to do in Wrath.
---
I solo farmed it with my mage at 70 (maybe it was 80, been a long time)
---
How did you get exalted with the blood elves before BC dropped?
---
After you kill the mob, you're probably going to loot the mob, and also possibly skin it, the duration of the pros is VERY short
---
This is nothing. Ask a Druid to pick between Blackhand's Breadth and Mark of Tyranny
---
It's still pretty dogshit. If it was an instant cast on the summon instead of mana and soul shard, I'd use it. Right now, it's a vanity item
---
Then you plan better next time.
---
So since we in tinfoil hat zone im gonna toss in my thought to add to yours. Lets say its like you say to get subs and interest back,  ow the work on and eventually put out... World of Starcraft! Bring this out with the feel of classic wow, not fast paced stuff it is today. Now i know SC is futuristic and wow is the opposite but i think they are leaving an untapped possibility out.
---
This is correct. 10 levels and early raiding of the Soul Harvester is infinitely more valuable than the handful of times you use the shard.
---
The whole post is about leveling time.  It's fine to be about the journey, not the arrival, but that's not the subject here.
---
Only if you make it one. It would be nice to have a slider that shows population.. then again that could just make the problem even worse by making people choose the dominant faction.
---
I thought it was good. Tad long, but it needed to be. Cant believe how many contradictions the OP had...
---
Speaking from experience, spriest dominates every class except warlock. Having the extra dot and wotf will come in handy against them so that would be my pick.
---
Depends ofc why you want to do - an aggressive ”take-down” could create drama and the internet loves drama so that could give you views ofc. But will you have swayed ppl to your point of view? You quickly established that you didn’t trust the other video and for good reasons. But perhaps try to create more of a journey rather than a hard take-down - ”this first thing he said made me a curious” followed by ”I started wondering why he didn’t use vids from his guild” and slowly walk the viewer to a dramatic revelation - he’s a fraud!!  In your video you flash that straight away and then hammer in your points. 
---
Anyway, that’s just how I like it. You seem to have great technical skills and should do what you enjoy ofc
---
Generally you don't mount up unless you're riding more than like 20 seconds (keep in mind mounts have twice the cast time they do on live), so I'd say you're probably fine.
---
T2 3-set, Meditation talent and downranked heals make it pretty easy to manage mana. Make sure you have pots and demonic runes for longer fights.
---
You will control the mobs with aggro and slows. You won't be kiting all the dragonkin in a huge circle around the room like some guilds did back in the day.
---
Hunter kiting:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJeo90I7vNI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJeo90I7vNI) 
---
That is the kind of kiting i am advocating against. It should not be required. It risks transferring aggro to healers. Keep in mind the hunter does not only have to pick up the mob, but also have to keep adding threat to ensure none of the healers pick any of them up. Even the best hunters can mess this up as it becomes increasingly difficult to target individual dragons.
---
You should intentionally grab aggro off of the furthest away orc. In my guild, we had different hunters assigned to each sector of the room, so that the 4 spawn points furthest away from the center of the room were always picked up by a hunter. If it's a melee, the tank will have taunted it by the time it reaches the center. If it's a caster, you can disjoint the cast with a feign death. At which time, the pet will have more threat than the healer on the caster mob. Keep them off the healers, and keep them off the other DPS.
---
This quest is introduced so late in the patch cycle that you can and will easily replace the weapon with a multitude of things very soon.
---
Trinkets useful long term. Especially if you farm dungeons.
---
Preach. Legion and BfA are “WoW2,” and there’s no reason to expect an actual sequel would be wildly different. They’d never go back to non-homogenized classes. They’d never go back to making players spam others for dungeon runs. The list goes on and on.
---
If you need proof of how streamlining and casual play would be designed into WoW2, just look at every Blizzard game, patch, and expansion released since 2006.
---
Dude, the issue with current Blizzard is not social justice. They're still a bunch of white nerds making stuff for other white nerds, not to mention the blacks/gays/women aren't your enemy, its the money grubbing capitalists. You're delusional if you think black lesbian feminists requesting representation is the reason triple AAA gaming blows now a days. Its because of big data and big money. If any thong social justice enables creative work because it pulls from many sources while corporate boot licking pulls from one source, how you this piece of work can squeeze the most money out the consumer. I'd prefer to see what your straw man group could come up creatively then the data analysts and money men. At least then it would have a voice and be inspired.
---
isnt it the same for warlocks?
---
Can’t wait to see all these mages without a threat meter spamming frostbolts over and over and getting pissed off because of the “shit tank” can’t hold threat.
---
Classic WoW is likely to be a separate program considering it's using a different engine than retail (Legion). It should show up on Battle Net as a separate game but only require a subscription to play.
---
Lets just wait and see \^\^
---
Too bad they deactivated set bonuses on all tier sets before Legion (Or did they turn those off too?). Its pretty stupid.
---
You're being downvoted for telling the truth.
---
Those damn explode on impact plant things, and then the stone giants that stun... its possible but it just becomes such a pain in the ass
---
I’ve never said that it won’t be a different program
---
Why do you think there is a slight favorability for alliance? Paladin? Better in PVE?
---
I would like updated graphics. It should be client side, for weirdos who like playing with outdated graphics ..they can turn settings back to potato
---
Ziz Fizziks.
---
Thank you all for the responses. But, based on self-healing through vampiric embrace shadow priests have the highest total dps converted to healing in a pvp setting out of all the classes right? Or, does a warlock compete with their drain life, health stone, and siphon DoT... ?
---
&gt; Classic wow is a server option for retail
---
You just said it would be the same program. Retail means 8.1.5
---
Base vampiric embrace without 2/2 improved definitely heals you for straight up 20% of the shadow damage dame **and the heal can crit**.  I don't know for sure if improved VE then ups it to straight 30% but I would assume so. 
---
Both SL warlock and spriest work for that kind of outlasting but I don't really know which one has more effective HP in a fight. 
---
Biggest problem doing 1v2 or 1v1 as shadow priest is their mana usage but you can make it work.
---
I wonder what heals more after +spell damage +shadow damage scaling shadow guard or devouring plague... warlocks can dispell shadow guard but they can't dispel devouring plague because its a disease?
---
I agree completely, i just think it would be sad to force a certain topic into the chat, instead of letting it develop into its own 2019 self (or 2020 ... )
---
People are better now and actually use their utility in my experience. I can imagine back in the day lots of Paladins did not make full use of their kit and amounted to a crappy DPS most of the time, giving them a bad rep. But a skilled Enhancment Shaman who uses their whole kit because they understand they're also a support class are amazing. Sometimes you need extra heals or what have you in a pinch and classes like Pala and Shaman provide that.
---
What were you banned for? Just curious :p
---
My old Druid acct got taken back from the original owner after I had attached it to my battle.net acct. I hadn’t bought the acct, he let me play his Druid when he quit. Decided one day to come back and that acct disappeared along with the battle.net attachment.
---
Level up through AV quests. Honor, rep, XP and the frostwolf howler is beautiful
---
pfUI is pretty much elvUI for 1.12 clients. We should see elvUI in Classic.
---
On my enhancement shaman on Nost, I had around 400g upon level 60. I actually lost a bit of money on my profession on the way, but I simply didn't buy anything off the AH, and only learned skills that would actually be relevant while leveling. \
---
On my Hunter on [the first successor server to Nost), I leveled alchemy and herbalism, and did make a fair bit of money off of it. But I also took a strategy of not spending money on the AH or leveling skills I didn't need (which made people a bit upset in dungeons because I had my epic mount before aspect of the pack lol). I had a bit of 600g upon hitting 60.
---
You would be surprised what not learning useless skills can do for you.
---
Blizzard called it a server option, I didn’t coin the term.
---
Considering it was nerfed in a future expansion, I'm pretty sure we are talking about the classic one.
---
You do not remember the prices of the bars... it costed more than a normal epic mount
---
You didn't mention hex of weakness. While it's only 20% healing reduction, it is ranged and spammable compared to 10s cooldown mortal strike. Of course if your AB premade has 5 warriors you don't need the hex but it was incredibly undervalued racial back in the retail vanilla days from what I remember.
---
Yo this is seriously a thing now though.  And I don't get it because that would imply its a newer generation of gamers that are reporting, but we all know newer generations are the ones being most offensive and reportable... A very interesting situation
---
How would u know if it will be added later than at launch? Sunken temple is available at launch isnt it? Going by pirate servers timeline is a bad idea
---
Well yeah you didn't lose exp for PvP deaths in EQ either. You did lose all the money you were carrying to the person who killed you though, although you could store it in the bank. And if you were insane enough to play on Rallos Zek, the person who killed you could also loot 1 item off your corpse as long as it wasn't 1) In a bag, 2) A held item, or 3) A soulbound item.
---
EQ PvP culture was very different though. Most people followed the player-created "loot and scoot" rule, meaning you were allowed to return and loot your corpse without getting killed again as long as you immediately left the area. Most PvP in EQ was for territorial control. Most dungeons and cities in the game would be controlled by a single guild who would kill anyone who entered them if they weren't aligned with them.
---
It’s mostly because they are tanky, have Fel Hunter (constant spell lock outs), chain fear/death coil and shadow ward, not so much the health regen abilities.
---
Forgot to mention your other competition is other spriests, in which case undead is supreme (dot is a curse and wotf).
---
Is that something that they changed in 1.12 or something? It definitely used to. I even found an old note about it:
---
&gt;Reduction
---
This is the term given to the effect seen when a reputation from a mob or quest is lower because of the level difference. Once the mob goes grey, or a quest is six levels below you, you lose 20% of the total reputation possible for the kill/completion for each level. This goes this way for four levels, until you reach the minimum reputation gain of 20%. Example:
---
Morrowgrain to Feathermoon Stronghold is a level 50 quest. At level 56 it becomes grey. The level rewards look like this.
---
Regardless, what you said is definitely true. The orcs and Forsaken have a lot more quests that are focused for their reps. Same with Human/Nelfs on alliance. Trolls and Gnomes are probably the hardest.
---
I don't remember length of the AVs while I was farming blood elf rep (it's been a while), but I think either the item pickups from off corpses stayed for a little outside of AVs, or they still ran for long enough to get a decent couple of turn ins. It was a grind, but I don't remember it being terrible.   Although, I also leveled a character through felwood solely through furbolg rep turn ins up to exalted, so maybe I'm just accustomed to farming.
---
Me too man, this guy doesn't get that content in classic isn't just centered about rushing to 60 so you can actually play, classic is just as much the journey to 60 as doing stuff at 60, hope I see you in Wsg, and don't let anyone say you're playing the game wrong
---
Oops deleted my comment re: lock being strong against you.
---
I would like that too. I'm sort of surprised that the community is overwhelmingly against updating character models specifically. Especially since it would have no effect on the gameplay. Doesnt make much sense to me not to. I get it's about the nostalgia and all, just odd to me personally.
---
This is the real OOF. Personally I'd take Mark of Tyranny.

”Your way of playing isnt fun to me”
---
Not Wow2, D4.
---
That's what I am thinking. All signs point to a more MMO-like Diablo experience. They could be batting around the "which design do players like best?" A/B testing between Retail vs Classic to get a better handle on how to proceed in D4.
---
Tales from my ass hypothesis, but that's because we won't get a WoW2. We will be getting an end to WoW, though. Frozen WoW realms will be all that remains when they launch their next MMO if they know what's good for them. Classic and BFA.
---
Then if they are still viable farming strategies I expect them to start turf wars like the Devilsaurs for their leather in Un'goro Crater.
---
And at level 70 to boot.
---
Razorfen kraul (live) razorfen DEAD (ded)
---
It took old school runescape to completely destroy the player base of new runescape for blizzard to take notice.
---
I found that allys lvl 30-34 is by far the worst lvls
---
Huge hardcore crowd, therefore you have an overall bigger alliance population, because they are simply stronger in all ways to play an MMO properly.
---
Better in raiding.  
---
Better in group PvP.
---
Better in mass wPvP like emerald dragons and Kazzak
---
That being said: Lok'tar Ogar, victory or death!
---
So old school RuneScape
---
I don’t know you deserve coals for thinking they’ve been working on WoW2 since 2012. That was canceled and turned into overwatch.
---
I also didn't mention Touch of Weakness, which itself has a Shadowguard-esque component to it because it does shadow damage on proc.
---
I really don't think you can go wrong on the horde side, unlike alliance where if you're not a dwarf your own guild will chastise you.
---
I think it would be much better. Putting a meme here or there to emphasize some points or for comedic relief is fine. When you're putting 5-10s clips in reaction to half of Hamsterwheel or your statements, it adds up fast and makes the video a meme-filled slog.
---
As this stands, this video is half overedited garbage and half serious discussion. I don't mind overedited videos with memes all over the place, but I think it's better to go with montages of gameplay footage rather than a serious/semi-serious video. I think that you hit the balance between memes and serious content pretty decently at the TL;DR part of the video. The issue is that most people will probably stop watching before that. You're supposed to be calling him out (and you do), but you come off as mocking him much more than anything else.

I could be wrong, but in any case trying to maximize the rep you get from all quests will have you running all around the world clearing only green quests. Ive done it before, starting zone of orcs/trolls, then went to the undead starting zone clear those, then to mulgore, completed quests lvl 6 to 8 ob mulgore then back yo durotar then to tirisfal, did quests up to 11, then durotar  then mulgore, finished mulgore, finished durotar, finished tirisfal and headed to silverpine.
---
Its a fucking messs, but you will rarely have a hard time questing since you are always clearing green quests, and green or gray enemies, only trouble is when you get an elite quest.
---
If you got a friend do this, level together and clear all the quests on each zone at the same time, 1 can pick alch herb and the other can have engineering, mining.
---
So touch of weakness procs black out too just like shadow guard... does it scale with +spell power and +shadow damage too?
---
I don’t see a point for WoW2, classic was great and that’s why everyone is excited for its return, the changes with expansions is what ruined so in a way retail WoW is really like a WoW2 and classic is the original best. 
---
I say make World of Starcraft for exploration of new worlds and completely different story line!
---
That’s exactly what I did in MoP
---
Ah but you bought them separately so it was a 20% discount on 100g and a 20% discount on 900g, making it 880g in all.
---
The only way it would be efficient is if you had a dedicated group of 5 good players who know what they’re doing.
---
Sure but touch requires a melee or wand hit to be triggered which makes it extremely situational. If you are looking just for the stun you are better off spamming rank 1 pain.
---
Any added spell power from gear, talents, potions, etc will boost the damage of DP, which in turn boosts not only the healing received from the spell itself, but the healing further returned via Vamp Embrace. It's pretty good if you get the full duration out of it.
---
And yeah it's a disease, removable by priests, paladins and/or the dwarf racial Stoneform.
---
If everyone rolls from level 1 though, there will be a huge faction disparity as Horde are considered OP in TBC.
---
I, for one, loved the generic red hood.
---
Why would they have any desire to create WoW2?  They've continually added onto the original game by simply generating expansions.  If they were deadset on heavily updating the graphics or something, then it might make sense to actually start over from scratch, but why bother when WoW is still raking in money from millions of people in its current form?
---
My issue is the level of power of the staff is not proportionate to the difficulty of the quest. 1% hit is worth roughly 10-15 spell damage depending on how much hit you already have, putting the staff nearly on par with staff of dominance
---
https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=18842
---
This staff is a quest reward for a level 50 dungeon. If you prioritized it you could have this staff long before hitting 60. This kills the weapon slot for you before even hitting max level.
---
When I played on nost I used the rare epic dagger from mara all the way until diremaul came out. It's a shitty weapon but there's nothing better. Upgrading my weapon slot was great fun and really made me invest in my characters growth. It's just a shame that newer players or casuals who will spend a long time leveling will have this experience ruined for them by the introduction of items like this (and the 1.12 item stat changes that presumably will be live in classic.)
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=17780
---
It does scale with spell damage and I guess a lesser known(?) mechanic is that you can stack every rank of touch of weakness on you and then release them all with a single melee or wand hit which does quite significant damage actually. Problem is that each rank takes 1 global to put up and the buffs only last 60 seconds.
---
Agreed 100% which is again why, for horde, I think both races can excel. It will come down to looks for alot of people.
---
I dont think you understand what he is saying. At all.
---
Let's say a wolf brings a total of 50 extra dps to the raid through the buff.
---
A cat will do 60 extra dps over a wolf.
---
This means the cat makes the raid do 10 more dps. All you have to do is keep it alive. Yes, it shows up as hunter damage, but that doesnt matter because it is still more overall damage to the boss.
---
That is what the guy you are arguing with is saying, and he would be correct. A cat does more damage than the wolf + melee group buff.
---
In addition to that, if you have a resto Druid in a 5 man a dps shaman/pally is always welcome for a proper res.
---
I did this back in Vanilla with model editing lol. I couldn't figure out how to change the skins yet... later on I fixed it but the process was hilarious...
---
Nice video, thanks for posting. As someone who didn't raid Naxx back in the day, I was really discouraged by his video. Mostly the buff/mat farming made it seem like Naxx was completely unapproachable by anyone with a job. 
---
Your video has given me hope that maybe I will finally get to clear it in classic. I know that it will still be hard but it no longer seems impossible.
---
So thanks!
---
&gt; When the patch hit I got the training automatically for having an epic mount in my bag
---
That was because of the change that was made in 1.12.1 when the mount rework came. Players that already had 100% mounts got the 150 riding skill.
---
You never needed epic riding to use R11 mounts in the first place. Not even during TBC. I don't understand what your point is.
---
Great video.  I only went 11/15 (4h and thadius blocked us).  I think I got caught up in thinking Consumables were used so much, which I sure didn’t.  A lot of points you made brought back a lot of memories and some stuff I just don’t recall.  I healed as a priest and I hardly ever used many consumes. I think progress on patchwork was the biggest I’ve used them.
---
Thanks for this.
---
Out of curiosity why do people not like troll looks? I think they’re the coolest horde race.
---
Wow i dont like what I see in the comments. Maybe Classic won't be so popular after all.
---
Indeed, BfA combined with that dumpsterfire that was the Diablo mobile announcement should be more than enough of a roadblock already.  However, I would argue that Overwatch has also shown some pretty bad signs.  IMO, Jeff and the OW team have done very little to improve overall quality of the game.  Sure, they're happy to pander to the crowd with new heroes, maps, etc, but it seems like they'll do exactly as much as it takes to drum up business for OWL and nothing more.  In any event, it doesn't matter what they do next.  Anything new with the Blizzard logo on it is likely to face alot of skepticism, and Blizzard has little experience contending with that.
---
i think you just put into words why i will probably not be playing classic.
---
I was thinking a diablo mmo could be a more hardcore friendly mom in keeping with classics design
---
Amen brother
---
The survey is a small subset of the playerbase, and isn't realistic in the slightest. There is some serious selection bias at play here. 
---
I admire the work some people are putting into analyzing it, and I hope they're having fun, but the data itself is completely worthless. You really need look no further than some simple realm stats to see this:
---
* 71% of census-takers claim they will play on PvP servers, but in actual WoW from 2006 up to today it has always been almost exactly 50/50.
---
* 7% claim to want to play on RP-PVP servers, compared to 2% picking PvE RP servers. But realm populations through 2006-2019 show that the actual RP-PvP population is _not even half_ that of normal RP realms. The difference between survey (3.5:1 ratio) and reality (0.5:1) is simply staggering.
---
Reddit and forum-goers, even casual ones, are still way more "hardcore" and thus different than the vast majority of the playerbase. Seriously, if you're reading this, you're already more invested in this game than literally like 95% of people who'll ever touch the game.
---
I guess not learning skills really makes such a big difference. I can ignore absolutely useless stuff, like learning skills Smite or Holy fire as a shadowpriest, but ignoring even small utility spells of your class is too much for me, I want to have all the arsenal.
---
Berserking doesn't work for most of a Shadow Priests stuff. Haste on DoTs isn't a thing, nor on channels. Meaning you only benefit from Mind Blast. That being said, you can still use Berserking to get heals out quicker, so it's not useless. WotF is superior, however.
---
Shadowguard is better than Touch of Weakness because it's more reliable (no melee damage required), has more charges (more blackout procs) and has better spell power scaling. Touch of Weakness' melee damage reduction isn't entirely negligible... but it's not nearly enough to compensate.
---
Shadowguard vs Devouring Plague is debatable. Devouring Plague was definitely considered superior back in the days, but at least on private servers there's a lot more Dwarves (that know when to press Stoneform). There's also a few more tryhards that actually get Jungle Remedies and stuff, although I wonder just how much of a factor that will be in actual Classic.
---
Shadowguard is more consistent as you can have it up for every fight, but an undispelled Devouring Plague can win you fights on its own. Shadowguard is also just irrelevant if you're pure healer without Blackout.
---
In the end it basically boils down to 1 powerful racial (Shadowguard) vs 2 above average racials (Devouring Plague + WotF). Nowadays most people give the edge to Shadowguard (at least for SP), but honestly the difference is so minor that I'd just go with whatever model you prefer.

I'm not naive, I live in a multicultural society and am friends with the people who identity with what you dismiss as "political ideology". I know it might be hard to imagine, but people other than white men would like a seat at the table and we lose nothing by allowing them to join. You're the naive one who has been tricked into believing its the people with no power that are the issue. 4chan isn't winning because they are purposefully mudding the waters by making non-offensive symbols into offensive ones. They've just discovered that the meaning of symbols changed based on who, how, what and why they're being used. The swastika isn't inherently bad, but shitty people using it as a calling card have made it bad. Same with the okay symbol, like great, white supremacists adopted the symbol and have ruined it for everyone, great thanks guys, you've really proved the point that everything your craven hands touch is corrupted. No one wants to be part of your bullshit, that is all 4chan has proven.

More or less. And that's just for one race/faction.

Comment your favorite staff??

PVP: Maybe.

PVE: No.

The fact that your footwear never shows so even at level 60 fully decked out in epics you still look like your not wearing a complete gearset because your hobo feet are sticking out from under your robes combined with their terrible posture are why I can't stand the way they look.

If they would stand up straight and wear boots I'd probably think they're the coolest looking race.

It's 1000g combined. A 20% discount is 200g off regardless of how you divide the 1000g between the mount and riding skill.
---
900g mount \* 0.8 = 720g
---
100g skill \* 0.8 = 80g
---
720+80 = 800g
---
If they were bost costing the same, as an example.
---
500g mount \* 0.8 = 400g
---
500g skill \* 0.8 = 400g
---
400+400=800g
---
Please refer to my previous post where I claimed people suck at math.
---
“A hybrid Is always better than a pure dps”
---
Ehhh no....
---
Don’t get me wrong they are awesome and having one in a group really does help a lot.  But when it comes down to it they will never be a ‘better’ choice than other dps classes. That doesnt mean they shouldn’t be invited
---
Even a biased sample isn't completely worthless.  And I'm not so convinced this is a biased sample anyway.
---
Being more engaged doesnt make you any less representative of the longterm Classic WoW population, necessarily.  The stats you quoted could be the result of shifting demographics or may be the result of giving the population the choices of modern and classic wow products.
---
This survey is, quite frankly, the best representation of the expected classic wow population we have at the moment.
---
We had Feral Druids in our raids when 2.0 came out, but prior to that the only Feral Druids I ever saw were in BGs. And there was one really good Feral Druid from our server who used to make videos and stuff and posted them online. It was the Skullcrusher server if anyone remebers.
---
Yep, its the only real option since that trinket is never replaceable. It's still a very difficult choice. Especially if you want to play feral DPS and you are not sure if you will have access to DFT and Naxx trinkets.
---
Earthstrike+HoJ would be the best options in that case.
---
My house my rules all of my friends are respectable.
---
This actually JUST worked for me. I had no idea this was a thing, and I went for it to try and find my first account I ever created back in TBC. It got hacked and I eventually gave up and made a new account. I'm blown away right now.
---
Brd  is about an hour per run unless you are doing a full quest run or are new / not very good.  Which involves hearthing / flights and running which again plenty of travel time
---
Classic WoW is more nostalgia for most people. It was such a different game in terms of just about everything. Forced raid specs, alot of specs being garbage, 40 mans, nothing to honestly do outside of raiding, 5 mans, and PvP, a grindy PvP system (Honor system), took forever to level, very hard raids, sparse quests, elite monsters, etc.
---
40 man raids were nuts. You had 8 parties full of people. Only like 0.01% of the top guilds ever finished C'thun or Naxx.
---
BC is when they started cleaning up and redoing everything that made the game so much better. WOTLK was just better polish, but they started going too casual on things. I raided in a top 40 guild in both BC/WOTLK and it was constant 10-15 hours of raiding a week for years.
---
For 5man, which is what we are talking about here. Yes, they are absolutely better in every scenario.
---
Extra totem, extra blessing, extra bop and the toolkit of a hybrid will ALWAYS be better for a 5man dungeon than doing slightly more damage. In a 5man you wont even have access to the correct debuff slots and buffs for the pure classes which means the gap between what they can do and a hybrid can do gets a lot smaller than in raids.
---
It's not really about saving time it's about learning who is a good fit for your future groups. Smoke breaks may be ok for casual play, but my groups are made for efficiency.
---
There are plenty of people who just fish and mine in AV and don't actually contribute, but get honor. You'll be fine for sure.
---
Well that depends, are you interested in the demographics of redditors who have an interest in wow classic? Because if so, you have an excellent source of information in that survey.
---
Are you interested in how the realms are actually going to look after 2 months of stabilizing? Then, no, it's actually completely worthless, sorry to say. Even the class breakdowns show significant differences between private server data and the survey, as you said yourself. And that community by large overlaps with reddit's, except they have more gameplay experience (turns out leveling certain classes kinda sucks...)
---
Disagree completely.  Sure I would prefer one if I had like a resto druid in the group or something but they are by NO means better in every situation.  That’s clearly BS
---
You have better advantage with mount in WSG
---
This is so in depth I love it!  Now in regards to vampiric embrace it heals you for 30% of all shadow damage done right? So technically speaking if a shadow priest stacks +spell power and +shadow power... we should be able to sustain ourselves in 1 vs 2 fights or 1 vs 3 due to our super high damage being converted into healing?
---
I just want to know if vampiric embrace is as good as people say... because when i watch pvp classic wow videos it doesn't seem to do much healing from my point of view. Even when mind flay is cast it only heals for like 79 damage per second which doesn't seem like a lot. Shadow word pain probably 59 damage every 2-3 seconds 140 if it crits and mind blast maybe 250-340 depending on crits... mind you I think these people were well geared up to warlords pvp set. 
---
I wonder if warlocks self healing with drain life and/siphon is equivalent or even better than a fully talented vampiric embrace stacked with +spell power and +shadow damage gear....
---
Were we talking about close-knit groups? I don't think it was specified.  
---
Sounded more like a pug to me.
---
Short answer is YES, yes you can.
---
Long answer brings the question of "why bother?". Especially at the beginning there'll be more than enough tanks around. And finding a group that will allow "non-tank" won't be super easy either. The holy trinity cannot be broken - at least that's the mantra in most peoples heads.
---
Most importantly would be to have someone with plate at least. A paladin or such would do good for the adds. Warlocks and Hunter, both, are pretty decent at tanking. Hunters even can AoE Tanks quite significantly once they get hold of the gorillas in Stranglethorn. Before that they'd ideally use a turtle to mitigate more damage spikes. Warlocks require more healing than a Hunter though, so your healer must be willing to output heavily, too.
---
They removed the water in time walking black morass because of this.
---
Let's just agree to disagree then. My opinion is based on doing literally hundreds upon hundreds of dungeon runs (245 BRD for Ironfoe alone). I know which classes makes the runs smooth and which doesnt, and pure DPS is pretty far down my list.
---
What's not to understand? =P click on a piece from each set and you see where you get them, faction sets are bound to instances and pvp gear requires a certain pvp rank
---
On PvP Servers I think so. I don't see it as a problem on PvE Servers tbh.
---
That post was long?
---
Mounts scale up a bit if the rider is a gnome.
---
I will use a swing timer, something to combine the bags, something to change into a fancy fucking outfit on command (also fishing suit I guess), and auctioneer.
---
thats it my new guild is called &lt;Mighty Dudes"
---
Won't classic have crossrealm? If server A is alliance heavy and server B is horde heavy they make crossrealm teams.
---
People who didn't main pallies acting like they mained pallies.
---
I was a pally in bc and those fucking bars cost a lot more than 25 fucking gold.
---
That’s the case now, but it started from a similar vein to Classic and the changes introduced were all passed by player vote so the community is happy :)
---
Raids and dungeons are only available through dungeons and raids, yes. PvP sets are only available through ranking, mainly done in battlegrounds. All of them will not be available at launch, no.
---
Tier 0 &amp; 0.5: Level 60ish dungeons (at start and patch 1.10)
---
Tier 1: Molten Core patch
---
Tier 2: Blackwing Lair patch
---
Tier 2.5: AQ40
---
Tier 3: Naxx
---
PvP sets: Honor system patch
---
Right because that's 100% of five man content in retail. /eyeroll
---
This is correct. I soloed the quest at 60.
---
that’s... actually kinda hot
---
Ugh, yeah. My first character was a troll rogue in Vanilla. Ended up rerolling at around level 45 because I just could not stand running around bare feet. How you look has always been important to me in video games, and it was a bit of a dealbreaker at the time.
---
By all means TBC and on had much better QoL for the player, but that’s what started eroding communities within the game. Server communities are dead, no one talks to each other anymore, and frankly doesn’t care because everything is instant. Yeah, that game sucks for casual players, but I’d rather trade not having the best gear to get the communities back.
---
See that? He looks like ass. But you know what? Who the fuck cares in vanilla. He’s got a fuckin JUDGEMENT HELMET
---
Do you have any proof Lasher farming will not work in classic or are you just assuming that it won't? I'm genuinely curious.
---
Except this community would rather jump off a cliff than accept that maybe some aspects of vanilla are completely broken.
---
By the time Blizz would want to make changes 90% of the people will be gone, and the people who remained won't care about the game being broken.
---
Mine is a good one
---
We had one that became feral because he was sick of healing and clearly did his part, so we let him play at the time, we didn’t knew about power shapeshifting...
---
Pretty much but it was really passive aggressive, raid nights used to be full of people jokeing and a music bot. Then he came.
---
Forsaken start at neutral... I absolutely love that. Such a minor thing that some might see as an inconvenience, but I see as a cool little lore nugget.
---
Retail practically already IS "WoW 2", with how insanely different it is from earlier versions. There's no reason to release another entirely different game when it's just going to be "WoW but kinda different".
---
Well yes that was exactly my point.  I am, in fact, interested in the demographics of redditors who have an interest in wow classic.  You can write off nineteen thousand people if you want.  I'm not going to do that.
---
Anyway, nice tool, OP :)
---
Sweet mother of God, those female trolls though.
---
&gt; They were making an MMO for along time, Titan
---
It was confirmed multiple times that Titan was NOT an mmorpg, NOT related to WoW, and NOT a competitor to WoW.
---
Human racials, and paladins blessing 30% less threat are pretty big on their own.
---
around level 24ish or so I'll start fighting a second mob using psychic scream to keep it busy. SWP does about half of it's HP by the time I finish killing the first mob.
---
They confuse the crystals for bars, maybe.  
---
No way an alchemist would sell a 24h cd 24g that needed a rare gem that came from high level zones thorium veins.  
---
I remember paying around 80g even more on silvermoon EU. And remember the rest could get discounts, paladins not. ( Also another fact, paladin spells were more expensive than ither classes )
---
This one isn't even a choice. Always take Mark of Tyranny. 
---
For DPS, you have two options that are very easy to get: Hand of Justice and Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom. (Horde has a 3rd called Rune of the Guard Captain, which comes from a level 50-ish quest.) Blackhand's Breadth might be *slightly* better than all of those, but the difference is not much. Blackhand's Breadth is definitely NOT the difference between you topping the meters and you being at the bottom.
---
For tanking, there are exactly two items with bonus armor that fit in those two slots. Mark of Tyranny is one of them. You need to take it if you ever even think you might tank.
---
I was an enchanter and had almost that amount by 40, I think maybe I had to borrow 10-20 tops, but that can be made an an hour or two tops, so some people naturally take those routes without thinking about it. For example of you go straight to STV at 35 and skip shimmering flats you will probably be behind by literally 5-7 gold. Ironically humanoids drop cash which makes them worse for farming cash than beasts who drop stacking greys. I think you need from 37-40 probably 600-800 kills, without questing and if each one gave 1 silver on avg thats your lvl 40 mount guaranteed, if one drops a green that vendors for 30-1g you just hit the jackpot. Sincerely I think you are leveing in ways that maximize experience not gold, but I bet if you loot at /played you get your mount at 43 similarly to someone who grinded to 40 and got it at 40.
---
Except that's how old school was on the beginning... once you exhaust content, people become open to new content changes that don't stray too far from the original game. Plus yknow, it's polled.
---
If it takes your group 6 hours to clear ST it's faster to just not do ST in the first place. It's only worth doing if you have all the quests and your group knows what they're doing, and can complete it without wipes.
---
What about the Warlocks?
---
I gave one of mine away.. I miss Oprawindfury .. She was a great shaman
---
You won't have 95% servers like that in classic because faction changes won't be a thing.
---
I bet you didn't leave him with 7500 health.
---
Nobody cares about PvE carebear servers, dude.
---
honestly you are going to be going pretty much everywhere. You are going to run out of quests as you level, teldrassil will take you from 1-10/12 ish then darkshore might take you from 10-14 until you run out of quests you can do, then youll go to a different 10-20 zone, do those quests, run out of those, come back to darkshore for more quests, rinse repeat for pretty much every quest zone. Dont expect to have a straight forward "Go here from 1-10, Here for 10-20, here for 20-30 etc etc" it just doesnt exist in vanilla. Both in vanilla and in private servers I dont think i can remember a time where I was able to successfully quest from 10-20 in a single 10-20 zone.
---
There is no arena in classic
---
There is 0% chance Blizzard will make a WoW 2. Listen to anyone who worked on the original one. They never wanted to make another mmo again. Titan failed miserably.
---
Why spend the MASSIVE time and resources that mmos require, when you can make much simpler games like Hearthstone that make as much money? 
---
Blizz will never make another mmorpg.
---
Depends on if it's max level wsg or leveling wsg. They can actually flag carry sort of well at low levels, but once you get max level you play defense in my experience.
---
They have a value for the AQ war efforts n
---
If your smart you save stacks.
---
oh
---
Oh hey, that's super cool that you played on every server and were part of every forum discussion regarding pallies and their mounts.
---
There WERE (I love capitalizing words to make a point) people out there saying pallies got a free epic mount. "you don't have to buy a mount, you just have to do a quest"
---
I know this for a fact because that's why I rolled a pally.
---
It's either the Activision idea to make free money with reused content or Blizzard deciding to test out old mechanics that worked back in a day and decide which could be applicable to a newer game. Outside of obvious desire of making the version the game available for all the players that want to play and to fight off pservers.
---
Mind sharing how?  I'm guessing you use trinket to summon free void, tell him to stay, then outrange him so he despawns?
---
Oh cool. So you don't remember how much it really cost.
---
I got my epic mount in bc (not a private server) as a pally and arcanite bars cost a lot more than 25g.
---
How did you get your hands on this gem 🤤
---
Well it's not JUST 300g; that's just the actual gold needed for the first two quests. You still have all the mats like the pristine black diamond and arcanite bars and all that, plus I think you have to pay another 50g or so for the magic horse feed if I'm remembering right. If you buy everything instead of farming it yourself then it can potentially end up costing more than a regular epic mount depending on the server economy.
---
As far as time requirements go though, 120-150 hours is level 1-60 and another 120-150 hours is 1200-6000 gold from grinding depending on class.
---
In Osrs 120-200 hours is like 1 or 2 max level skills lol.
---
&gt;  I am, in fact, interested in the demographics of redditors who have an interest in wow classic
---
Oh, well then, I believe you've found just the tool to use! It is indeed nice. Have fun :)
---
Its design may be different if Classic is a big success.
---
He literally said they shouldn't be linkable. I mean, at what point should I simply give up because the current meta is that anyone can invent their own reality in response to a 2 sentence post?
---
Recovered it after the scammer was allowed to TAKE BACK THEIR MONEY FROM PAYPAL. 
---
Recovered my account and found over 1,000 gold  and a BUNCH of rare mats. Some Chinese gold farmer tried to scam me, so he had my account for like a week until I took it back and jacked all of his money. LOL!!!
---
does innervate work on your current spirit or spirit at time of application? or is this a "we don't know true classic yet, just pserver" situation?
---
fuck that then
---
The point isn't for when you have easy access to soul shards. It's for when you don't want to fly out to farm them, or in a low level zone.
---
\&gt; 10 \[Arthas' Tears\]
---
As far as I remember he run quite fast, I remember trying to outrun him with aspect of cheetah and he got to me anyways.
---
Downranking separated the wheat from the chaff in regards to healers. Patch was nutty yes but an inspiration priest keeping armor buff on the tanks worked wonders.
---
Funny story about buying gold, the gold farmer traded me TWICE the amount of gold I purchased and later on whispered me "Can you please give me that gold back they are going to take it out of my paycheck". So being the honest man I am, muted and reported.
---
That's a great question! I was curious about that myself. It seems like all the hardcore Raiding guilds I see videos of from private servers run Alliance, so my hypothesis is that more people are interested in PVE over PVP and thus there is a slight bias towards Alliance? No clue if that's correct.
---
I will say that if you filter by things interested in (question 5) proportionally more Alliance answered Dungeons and Raids, and proportionally more Horde chose World PVP and Battlegrounds (as in relative to the proportion who answered the survey over all).
---
I play both games (I have a maxed ironman in osrs). There's no doubt that osrs is grindier, but the grind requires much less focus than classic wow does, most of the skills can be done without paying much attention to your main screen, its a lot easier to watch movies/tv shows with osrs
---
Fandom isn't a great website for that kind of information. Try http://classicdb.ch/?itemsets 
---
That will show you all the sets for each class. The faction sets don't have a class restriction. Tier 2.5 and 3 can be a little confusing because they don't drop directly from the raid. The boss will drop a quest item that's shared by a few classes and you turn that in for the gear.
---
I played druid in an alt raid mc in vanilla, I was otherwise a warlock.. but I learned in tbc / wrath that it's best to pop mana pots and stuff early.. I always would just pop one when I got low.. but if you pop a mana pot at say 90% mana, you can use another one generally if you get down to that 10/20% mana again.  instead of being at 5% and being sol.
---
this is if you think ahead of time that you think the fight will last that long.. doing pot a mana pot at 90% and end the fight at 80%. that would be a waste then :)
---
Doesn't matter. People will inspect you in person and check your achievements. 
---
Also having achievements and not making them linkable would be very fucking inconvenient. 
---
Also if there are no rewards nobody will do any achievement ever except for the ones people require you to have for raids.
---
If you have to kneecap a system in order to make it remotely viable in the game, it's probably best to leave it out. You know what we did in vanilla? We made our own achievements. Do that and have fun with it.
---
If you can make raid times all you'd need is a bit of consumable farming, no where near the extent he says. Consider this when picking your class. Caster dps has a higher gold requirement for progression.
---
Lol!
---
Could you imagine a store clerk giving you wrong change then begging for it back? 😂
---
I'm preparing a version of this video with less memes.
---
1 or 2
---
God you're stupid. "Worthless"? Stop being such a drama queen.
---
It certainly has its bias - you suggested overstatement of PvP. That would also link to the overstatement of RP-PvP. Fine, I could believe that...
---
But given that I'm trying to understand if horde or alliance has higher representation of certain classes (e.g. Druids more on Ally, Warriors more on Horde, etc.), this is perfect.
---
So it's just you that's worthless &lt;3
---
Well, the MMO genre has been dying for a long time now. Sure, WoW always has been king, but it hasn't had any competition for about a decade.
---
The ol' prophecies from those days were correct, the only thing that would kill WoW was itself.
---
Boy, unless they update the models and textures, I don't see the VR being all that popular.
---
You can't sell tokens like that. You can only sell them via the regional AH.
---
Both are viable. I’d argue that wotk can win you more fights than orc racial.
---
No one wants a remade version,  fuck that and fuck transmog  and I love that " get rid of all the stupid shit, ridiculous mogs ect" what if all the stuff you consider great is what everyone else thinks is ridiculous.
---
If classic is popular I really wouldn't be surprised to see it progress through TBC and Wrath. I'm not sure if they'd make changes or keep them how they were with cherrypicked patches.
---
If they implement vanilla tauren properly, they will have an increased 2yard melee range, but can also be hit 2yards further by people.
---
As warrior with a healer in your back, this 2yard increased melee range can really decide fights. 
---
Also you are more likely to be targetted. If again you play with mates as you should as warrior, against casuals they can hide easier while you tank damage and dish it out.
---
Undead is quite meh and probably the weakest of the warrior races on horde side.
---
Really? Evaluate please :D
---
Said the person who plays wow classic.
---
It's designed for carebears, dude. Every MMO before was more hardcore.
---
Absolutely.  I believe I had something like 12-15 mods eventually. 
---
There were awesome mods out there that provided all sorts of useful functions without giving any gamebreaking or unfair advantages.  For example, I used one for my mage that buttons for food/water conjure, portals/teleports, intel buff, etc.  All the buttons provided useful info such as the CD on the spell, how much conjured food was in my inventory, number of portal runes I had, etc.  I will definitely go searching for it at some point.
---
People confuse the 1.11 AV changes with the 2.3 AV changes. In 1.11, the number of guard trash mobs was decreased since they were just being steamrolled by AQ-geared players anyways and weren't doing anything but putting free loot in the mix. The amount of HP non-humanoid creatures was also decreased a bit so that people who were more interested in the PvE side of AV could go off and do PvE objectives with those.
---
2.3 removed all of the Lieutenants, Commanders, and removed elite status from most of the mobs in the battleground. Capture times for towers and graveyards was reduced, and bonus honour for PvE objectives was limited to towers and the enemy captain. Reinforcement count was also added, putting a hard cap on respawns and the time an AV instance could last for.
---
1.11 didn't kill Alterac Valley. 2.3 did. Everyone just thinks it was 1.11 for some reason.
---
Yep ill be playin on tbc pservers even after classic for this reason.
---
Unless, of course, you're like me and you heard "never tell anyone online your real name" and you signed up for your WoW account as; Rey Mysterio. : (
---
He did move on. He's now addressing a separate point, that of the rampant, elitist toxicity in this subreddit. I'll just ask the question you declined to answer again. Do you think the "atmosphere" and "community" of this thread is something to be proud of and is this the sort of environment we should look forward to enjoying in Classic?
---
No pressure my man. Do what you can.
---
You have an on use. With a CD CC (except stuns) breaker that can be used as you feel it’s needed. Compared to a 25% chance for stun/fear? Can’t remember. 
---
You also have cannibalize for heals to go with first aid.
---
(((Capitalists)))
---
Okay but if you are gonna make changes to make the game better wouldn't you want to do it before 90% of the playerbase leaves? Making changes after Naxx won't make anyone happy, the people who held out that long don't care.
---
Imagine getting this upset at a discussion about a WoW census. Wouldn't want to imagine what your average day is like... bet you make friends wherever you go.
---
That already happens in this game. Most people will remember the realm first, the top guild etc.
---
Achievements are artifical and break immersion.
---
Paladin is really boring until you get reckoning, then it becomes pretty fun timing your sits with enemy attacks.
---
I had three different mains between when I started and the time BC launched.  I didn't have much of a life back then, so I tried all the classes at one point or another.  The ones I enjoyed became lvl 60s and the others sat around forgotten in the lvl 10-20 range.  I know it can be tough to find the time for all that, especially if you want to raid, but I think it's worth the time to have an alt or two on the side.  You're paying for it, might as well enjoy all of it.
---
Unlike in later expansions the factions were somewhat balanced during vanilla, also having Paladins and Shamans separated helped greatly. Most likely because the game was new and nobody knew what was good or not. Even then vanilla private servers are never heavily lopsided for one faction or another, mostly because of Paladins and Shamans like I said earlier. So don't worry about balance too much.
---
TBC on the other hand? Now *that* is an issue. Every single TBC private server has an enormous faction imbalance, simply because Horde racials are far better than Alliance ones. Also since Paladins and Shamans can be played in both factions that just compounds the issue even further.
---
There is a simple solution to this issue if Blizzard decides to release TBC later so I'm not too worried.
---
Naive. 
---
Eager to spread your religious principles.
---
Forgiving of ridiculous behavior because of boogeymen. 
---
Your post was predictable based on your prior post.  
---
None of that brings into question that people with your mindset work at Blizzard and comprise a substantial proportion of the whole. Leftism above truth will automatically preclude soul in any product. It is a religion tinged with authoritarian tones with hollow, false dogma and customers sense when it is used inappropriately.
---
At the end it says the spec was 32/8/11. Nothing specific but based on the spells that are used I'd imagine it was something like this:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/BTD8fF9AATwCzAE

Ironically I agree with you, it wasn't in the original version and there is no need to include it now. But how does this change the fact that you preferred to smack a guy down on a purely ideological basis as opposed to addressing what he actually said?

Why does everything have to be so fucking fundamentalist man? Can't people have a wrong idea but still be worthy of politeness and civility? You know, like a normal conversation in real life? I mean, it seems obvious to me that no matter what the developers do to bring back the classic experience, if the majority of the playerbase act like jaded internet war veterans in the throes of a PTSD episode it's not going to matter. I'd genuinely love if you could explain how I am wrong here. Seriously.
---
Make mistake. Have fun. Take your time. You aren’t missing anything in the end game because you have so much mid game to discover.
---
Don’t rush and it will all get covered. I wish I could level my rogue again for the first time!
---
I personally am stuck on #nochanges
---
SPriest is a top-2 class for 1v1, probably being ousted by a good Warlock once they get some gear. I would caution your hopes of going out into the world and 1v3'ing. Your fear, even talented, is still on a 26sec cooldown. Your chances of survival in these situations, in theory, is higher simply with WoTF, but if you think you'll be ganking players grouped in packs, that's just not going to happen.
---
But I don’t want to play a Kul’Tiran
---
my point proven. Your quote doens't mention epic mount anywhere.
---
You are the idiot that assumed you got an epic mount for free, when in fact all you get is A mount for free for doing a quest. Which the qoute says and is true.
---
Thanks for wasting your time proving my point, it saved me the trouble.
---
I'm sorry, but WoW Classic is something we as the vanilla loving part of the community obtained after a hard fought battle with Blizzard. Months and months of begging them to do it. They're finally doing it, and if you've been paying attention you would see their desire to keep it as close to vanilla as possible. Everyone deserves politeness, but if you're even making a suggestion like this then you haven't paid enough attention to the WoW Classic project and you should think twice about posting. 
---
The "No changes except for the things I want changed" crowd just triggers me. I'm sorry. But this is the vanilla community's baby and you need to respect that.
---
It isn't enough, while it will sometimes let you ride through pools that will catch you walking, you will still get caught by pools shallow enough that other mounts could ride through.
---
El abominacion
---
It would be cool to have darker maps that need Torch or Light sources. Dungeons as well.
---
If classic is a huge hit I’m praying for a Starcraft universe mmo strongly vanilla inspired
---
Entirely depends on your group composition in my opinion. Having 2 shamans or 2 paladins would probably make any low level instance incredibly easy because even if they aren't intending to be a tank they naturally get the aggro and have good survivability. Having 5 cloth classes is much less viable because if someone gets aggro they will take a lot of damage. Something like 3 hunters and 2 shamans is probably somewhat viable as well, because there is a lot more damage than normal, people with single mob aggro can run around while others take the aggro from them, and you have 2 people with resurrection. 
---
Pets can tank small packs of elites, but packs with 3-4 elites will be harder than actual bosses. You probably need at least 1 person with a good health pool that causes high threat and isn't a cloth class (a tank) a druid, shaman, paladin, or warrior can fill this role. 
---
Shamans with a shield are probably unironically better at tanking than a warrior until 40+.
---
If you need help finding Makrik’s wife they’ll be happy to assist
---
Dude I was 11.
---
People told me we got an epic mount for free, you just hsd to do a quest.
---
Just because no one said it around you doesn't mean "no one said it" you vapid fucking retard.
---
I literally rolled a pally specifically because people were saying you didn't have to buy your epic mount.
---
Youre just wrong, man. It's not a big deal.
---
I honestly don’t want achievements but I would enjoy a personal tracker of some sorts(could be an add on) just tells you when you first cleared mc or leveled to 60 maybe took a screen shot and did a dvr to record last 30 seconds
---
There already is such a functionality, it's called your print screen button. We used it a lot in vanilla
---
Some of that gear has levels above sixty. How is that possible if sixty is the level cap in classic? Are some of these sets BC and Wrath?
---
Oh I didn't even look at that - that's interesting!
---
Thanks and you are very welcome!
---
The phrase "cutting off your nose to spite your face" comes to mind. I genuinely hope I'm wrong here, for my own sake as a player, but I simply cannot see how this sort of elitist fundamentalism isn't going to turn this reboot into a parody of retail. No exaggeration man, it's like an anchor on my heart, here comes Classic, nothing like it ever was.
---
So upset I even gave you a heart at the end haha
---
Dw mate I can call you out without getting emotionally invested ;) anyway last response from me. Ta ta for now
---
I'm a simple man, I see Frost, I watch.
---
HoJ works in feral forms?
---
Warriors don't need WotF because Berserker Rage, Recklessness and Death Wish already makes you immune to fear.
---
I think that's just the sites attempt at assigning an "item level". If you dig in, you'll see two columns on the gear. A "level" which is that item level, and required level, which is the actual level you need to wear it. Everything in there should be from vanilla
---
I use F /shrug
---
Orcs are quite superior because of Hardiness. Taurens also have decent racials. Just pick whatever do.
---
I would go female Troll to be a unique snowflake.
---
We're not elitist at all. Everyone can and should play WoW Classic if they're interested. But the reason we got WoW Classic in the first place is because of Nostalrius, a Blizzlike vanilla private server and the vanilla community. It's going to be as close to vanilla as possible without LFR or achievements or dungeon finder or quest helper. Accept that, and you're more than welcome to come play. People would love to have you. If you can't accept that, play BfA.
---
TBH that is not the hard part. The hard part is fighting the trial against Blizz after that.
---
It was quite annoying in BGs. For open world I think I prefer the extra bag slot.
---
Recklessness is a 30 min CD, most pvp warriors won’t have death as you will take MS,  that leaves you with berserker rage.  Having Wotf on top of that is a huge bonus.
---
You're making an extremely large assumption saying that 90% of the player base will leave, and also making an assumption that nobody would come back after, say for example, a new raid after Naxx was released that didn't fall into TBC.
---
My original account got stolen, and characters transferred off of it. Pretty shitty lol.
---
I'm happy it worked for you!
---
Oldie but a goodie!
---
As long as this quest is available in phase 1, I'm 100% getting the Soul Harvester. The early game dps boost of the staff will FAR outweigh the obscure benefit you will receive from the Abyss Shard in the future, if you can ever remember to use it. Also, enjoy having one less inventory slot forever.
---
i’m gonna log on and buy a 60 boost for every class
---
At least I'm glad enough you were stupid enough to spew this bullshit out publicly before you sober up in the morning, so everyone can have a good laugh at this lmao.
---
With how easy it is to farm them, there's no point in stuffing your bank full of that crap and holding onto it for 8+ months.
---
I've been hoping that Classic would go the way of OSRS ever since Classic was announced. New content, exclusive to vanilla, made with vanilla systems and design philosophy? Would be the fucking dream.

That was my plan! To melt multiple faces at once! I just thought vampiric embrace while stacking +shadow damage and +spell damage could sustain me... so warlocks are considered top tier? They do have lots of utility although I still don't know if their sustained healing through their damage spells is as good as ours.
---
And yet you so joyously win the war but risk the peace. Classic should be, and all signs point towards it actually being, a faithful reproduction. This \*does not\*, in the slightest, abrogate the requirement for the classic community to now start the process to include people in a positive way. How many years has that community fought to make this a reality but sure why not fuck it all away for the sake of feeling superior on the internet. It's what we do now, right?
---
I meant on an official realm at level 60.
---
I didn't even play in classic but I know what I'll try out when I hit 60!
---
Lmao, that's hilarious
---
I think it would be better DPS to auto attack while your mana is regenerating instead of FD + drinking.
---
One more thing to test once classic is out !
---
So does epic gear have better stats than rare gear?
---
#nochanges I guess then.
---
PS: Not everyone picks races for racials.
---
I don't think I'm being overly superior or toxic. But there's always toxic people, even during vanilla. PvP servers and ganking make some people very salty. 
---
I just think it's a foolish suggestion and one you wouldn't logically make if you know how hard the devs are trying to make WoW Classic as close to vanilla as possible.
---
If there’s a god overlooking game development he has forsaken us. Maybe the god will grant us our wish.
---
So tier 0 is the dungeon set, with, generally, the weakest stats. All blues. Tier 0.5 is built off tier 0, through quests and materials, you upgrade them, some of them to epics.
---
Tier 1 is from MC and is generally your first raid loot. Tier 2 is from BWL, it’s got even better stats. 2.5 is better, but only a 5 piece mini-set, from AQ. And tier 3 is from Naxx, the top raid.
---
Generally it will. Although some lower tier epics are worse than other rare options. Then there will be random rare and even uncommon that have a ton of just one stat. Later secondary attributes on epics are more valuable than just raw stats. But that's more of a bis question for each class.
---
It's a fair assumption, but yeah it may be added earlier this go around
---
I was literally going to post about this but got distracted this morning. Most players, myself included, have sunken so much time into retail wow that it's tough to give up  all the work we have done.
---
Classic is garnering so much attention and we will all be starting fresh toons I wonder if blizz will use the success (or failure) of classic to see if a WoW2 is feasible.
---
If it is a huge success they can revamp the code base entirely and make it look dramatically better. Either that or they go mobile and we all quit the game forever.
---
MAGE
---
UTILITY FOR YOU AND CC FOR DAYSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
oo really? interesting...
---
You can also insta cap flags in AB
---
&gt;Either that or they go mobile and we all quit the game forever.
---
Blizzard would lose all remaining respect I have for them.
---
Then it's still shit
---
Yeah I'm gonna have to make alts, my first choice is prot warrior (LOVE tanking!!) but if I can't find a guild then holy priest would be my second choice.   So I'm doomed either way for gold farming. At least my gold requirements for progression will be lower, didn't know that.
---
Thanks for the advice though!
---
I don't really quite understand what makes you ask this. Vampiric Embrace is a powerful ability for sure. But obviously, it cannot keep you alive on its own, even with a gear advantage over your enemy. You seem to be trying to decide between Warlock or Shadow Priest based on which one has more self-sustain or something?
---
If you're trying to compare Shadow Priest and Warlock, they honestly play the same to quite an extent. Both are cloth-wearing casters which lack sufficient means to consistently keep the enemies off of them, unlike Mages. This means that both classes end up having to face tank enemies a fair amount of the time.
---
Both have a lot of damage over time potential, and scale really well with gear. Warlock scales a bit better, but also needs more to really get going. Ideally, you want to have gear on par or higher than your opponent (again, unlikely say Mage, which can better deal with a gear advantage as their strategy is to avoid damage rather than tank it).
---
Both Shadow Priest and Warlock are also extremely strong in 1v1's, while they drop off a bit in group fights. This is only natural, as tanking damage in group fights is generally a poor strategy. Still, both classes can absolutely hold their own in 1v2's and even 1v3's depending on class matchup/skill/gear.
---
If you're trying to decide between Warlock and Shadow Priest, I'd rather think about the parts in which they're very different. Do you want to have the option to cast heals in PvP? Do you want to run the risk of not being allowed to get Shadow Priest gear and lagging behind on gear for your preferred spec? Do you like the idea of controlling a pet? Do you mind healing in raids? Are you OK with always being DoT-based DPS, or do you sometimes wanna be more direct damage (Destruction)?
---
Not an MMO? I'm pretty sure it was actually built to be a new kind of MMO and the reason it didn't compete with WoW is because it was meant to be a very sandbox design.
---
Same but different mats
---
Yeah, and then it was always used intermittently from there. Like I'm pretty sure the Belfs and Goblins started neutral as well. But the Draenei we're immediately friendly?!
---
If someone is in range to silence you they're also in range to attack you with any ability. You can't mount in combat
---
Even though I have seen a dwarf in the judgement gear before. But for some reason, I guess I must have forgotten, dwarves look goofy as shit in this gear.
---
There are always toxic people, I'm not arguing for a perfect world. In point of fact, given that reality, it is all the more reason why the people that fought to make this all happen should now, in light of the fact it is happening, be the ones promoting the sort of values that the original game had.
---
In brief, the OP is clearly asking for something for something that shouldn't be included. But when people on this thread respond by calling him a "stupid idiot" as opposed to explaining what the Classic vision is, in a normal and civil way, then how can I have any optimism for when the rubber hits the road and this is all playing out in general chat?
---
Quests that are Gray to you do provide less rep in Vanilla.
---
If you want exalted for another faction’s mount, it requires forward planning.
---
25% passive stun resist is just insanely OP. I'd say Orc is the most powerful in PvP, but all three of these bring something useful.
---
UD get one fear break and 5sec immunity. Also, they can *eat people* after they beat them in pvp. How badass is that?
---
Tauren get a free stun that can be used for peels and they also get a displaced melee range that can be a blessing or a curse depending on what class you roll. Also, 5% stam isn't much but it also isn't nothing.
---
Actually it will be way more than 90%. Assuming a VERY low number of 1 million players in the first month, 90% leaving would mean 100k active players after 12 months.
---
 100-150k active players is a very realistic number.
---
&gt;a new raid after Naxx was released that didn't fall into TBC.
---
I mean how many people do you expect to clear naxx, and then grind more for an even harder raid? And endgame isn't even the biggest problem in Vanilla.
---
It is. I levelled a blood elf warlock alongside a buddy levelling a paladin during TBC so I've basically done both
---
I don't, cuz I'm playing night elf and they have the best mounts. But damn, that sucks.
---
Hi, /u/Killsyourvibe
---
Even in an arcane build you still take frost channelling so you'll have 30% threat reduction. If your frost mages are doing 30% more damage than your fury warrior and locks than yeah your raid probably has some issues.
---
One relevant thing I've learned while working for a modern video game company was that the devs are wary of releasing the 'VideoGameTitle 2' when it comes to games that are an ongoing service - it risks splitting the community, making new game poach players from old game, ultimately leading to the downfall of both.
---
While it can be done successfully, looking at the effort blizzard put into optimizing and polishing WoW over the years, my guess is that they are not going to put so much time and effort into killing their still moneymaking game.
---
As far as I know, there's really not much detail as to what Titan actually was in specific, just that it was going to be an online class-based game.
---
You can get counterspelled by a Mage from 30yrds away.
---
female warriors are stronger.
---
If you have a use case in mind where hauling the trinket around is superior to simply generating one more soul shard when you're doing level-appropriate content, then use it. Just don't discount the opportunity cost associated with things that take up precious and limited bag space.
---
Well, that did yield better results. I have never been that great at researching things on the internet. But admittedly I didn't use google I looked in recent posts and hot posts, neither of which had any in them. So thanks for that.
---
man id lile to see 40 paladin mc
---
if someone could get on that for classic thanks
---
I'm thinking that saving addons for the endgame is a good idea. Enjoy the leveling experience, then go hardcore for the raids.
---
Yeah probably MoP with that black prince buff up there. I don't remember what that was. 
---
Screenshot's like 5 years old lol..
---
I think you are downplaying Hex of Weakness. Aside from mortal strike there isn't another spell or ability that reduces healing effectiveness. In BGs this is a pretty huge deal when you cast it on a warrior being healed by a pally or something.
---
Personally, I think troll is overall better than undead for priest. Devouring Plague, although fantastic, is far too easily dispellable (a paladin worth a damn will dispel it almost immediately), it costs way too much mana on an already mana hungry class, and is on a 3 minute cooldown, which, if it gets dispelled, absolutely sucks.
---
Berserking is low-key op in my opinion for priests. Your health drops and you get a clutch quick heal that heals your entire health bar. Will of the Forsaken, yes, is amazing, but priests trinket already removes fears.
---
they trick you with a free one first though
---
Why is is everyone such a douche when replying
---
they'll need to employ ppl that worked on classic.
---
But to be fair I would have googled "achievements in classic wow" and gotten a bunch of random aritcles and crap or forum posts from wow that would have been slightly off topic. I never would have guessed to put "classicwow" "Reddit" and "achievement" in the search bar to get reddit posts specifically lol that's kind of inspiring for future searches.
---
test
---
I'm not being a douche, it's true. Whenever a big moment happened we took a screenshot. If it was with our guild or friends we took it together. I don't understand why you would like them to incorporate a game system for something you can do yourself with the push of a button.
---
Looks like the snowflake specials will be:
---
Horde: Female Troll Rogue
---
Alliance: Female Gnome Rogue
---
Also berserker rage requires you to be berserker stance, so in case you get feared in battle or defensive stance you would still be able to break it with WotF
---
I know there's a 40 priest vs Onyxia video!  :)
---
I'd imagine they will put a list of servers before launch as well as realm types and regions.
---
I managed to do the quest before it was removed. It was a big pain in the butt. I never finished getting the bell I needed for my lock epic mount quest. I'm so excited to be able to finally finish it!
---
There is no way a WoW2 is coming.
---
MMORPG's are still a niche genre, WoW/FFXIV are anomalies. They cost so much to make too and are riskier compared to other types of games.
---
Classic is coming for one reason and one reason only: They realized there was money they were missing out. I think Nost was the final straw for Blizz that this could be their money. They didn't do it out of goodwill.
---
It's also unique in that they don't have to add new stuff to it. They can let it run for 3-6 years or however long they deem it profitable without ever touching a thing on it. Once the servers are up, it's going to be a skeleton crew of people just making sure the servers are working.
---
My strategy is to do enough damage and have some form of control while having enough sustained healing through damage in order to 2 vs 1 or 3 vs 1 in world pvp and opportunistic moments in BGs. That's why I kept asking how good vampiric embrace was sorry If I sounded confusing. 
---
I like the mixture of Dotting people and direct damage. I do enjoy controlling fights to that's why I thought of going with a mage too (but they look like clowns). Destruction lock seems interesting but I loathe pet management (unless I macro everything). I am not into healing at all (refuse to flash heal in pvp would rather die in shadow form) or raiding PvE. I'm strictly into PvP and BGs.  I know warlocks have better control than shadow priests and more burst damage too but shadow priests aesthetics and flavor really shines more than any class iv'e played. Lore wise it's very interesting as well.
---
BC I do miss a bit too, wotlk not at all. Thats just me.
---
Im hoping for new content with vanila game design in the big unexplored areas azeroth still has
---
this video is hilarious don't listen to the snowflakes you have every right to shit on his naxx review as much as you want
---
Fortnite had more of a cultural impact than WoW did.
---
I don't like to have to admit it, but the Ninja-Drake stream is going to live in infamy. Very few "normies" played WoW (Mina Kimes, Paul Walker, Vin Diesel) but celebs are basically in awe of Fortnite and Ninja, something that wasnt possible due to how "nerdy" gaming was still considered even 15 years ago.
---
No they just realized they could make money and were like "let's do that"
---
I remember doing one strat live run, I was a shadow priest, harbinger dropped the piccolo, and I won, our tank was livid and left, we did the rest of the dungeon by tanking with a MC mob
---
I'm ashamed to say I picked the robe. I know, I know, I was still new to the game :( I'd been rolling with my Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe since the early 30s and I was sick of it. Someone else won the Robes of the Lich (or w/e it was that dropped from RFD) and I just felt the urge to pick it and finally upgrade that slot. I then bought that BoE blue staff that looks identical to the quest item from Searing Gorge when you light the four towers and felt really good about myself. I no longer looked like a random assortment of clashing gear. 
---
Needless to say I'm looking forward to at least making either the right decision or the wrong decision this time, as opposed to the stupidly wrong decision :)
---
Nailed it
---
Thank you! Yeah i remember wiping on Kelris because we thought we could get away without clearing all the cultists... such a mean mechanic lol
---
Useless apostrophe's have overstayed their welcome.
---
(Its*)
---
BW was still terrifying as a fresh dinged 60 clothy, pet can basically solo people.
---
Wow, you’re so cool. I bet nobody fucks with you at the bar when they find out how many level 30’s you’ve ganked.
---
With their Activision overlords I think it's not far off. At least some version of it after their Diablo announcements as well as companions apps.
---
I'd rather they start from scratch and bust out a totally new balls to the wall story line, new classes, new code, full on WoW2. Ambitious I know but I can dare to dream.
---
There is a YouTube video that says you’ll get s free mount, to which I’ve been arguing with people for weeks that it’s not free. People are just stupid.
---
I rather they kill off worgen
---
Whats the 5 Second rule ?
---
The Alexaensual  picture lmaoooo. That dude was my raid leader in Legion and we all stopped showing up after a few weeks because of his shit attitude towards the game.
---
Originally started off as Dwarf Paladin because I thought humans were boring and the Paladin Warhorse looked super cool. Turned out to be kinda boring to play so after 40 I rerolled to NE hunter because I love animals IRL and you got to have a pet, got that to 60 and did some PvP and few MC bosses.. then TBC came, my longtime friend rerolled a Dranei Shaman and I went for a Priest cos they were like this super complex class who looked cool as hell in Shadowform and I really wanted to get into raiding which Shadow was apparently in high demand. 
---
Basically all my decisions were based off what looks cool and what my 14 year old self saw and was like WOOOAAAHH!!!
---
Tried a pserver recently, interestingly enough now Humans (and UD if I ever rolled horde which I won't.) are the only race that I like to play as everything else is kinda mishaped and disproportioned. (My true love is spacegoat really though)
---
Are you agreeing with me or arguing
---
WTB Kenshi MMO
---
I did it that way as well, they also gave me a free weekend.
---
You killed Loatheb but not Thaddius? A very unconventional path. What made you do that?
---
5 seconds without casting and you Regen mana normally, otherwise at 0% without talents/mp5 gear.
---
5 sec after you last spent mana, you start to regain mana based on your spirit.
---
I had an account from 2006. Most of my nostalgic memories are from it. I wish I could recover that one but I have non of the former information.
---
VR MMO please
---
Alternative strategy, if you are a raid or ot healer is to prioritize spirit and use trinkets like Blue Dragon to have ghetto innervates.  I did this from MC through first few bosses in Naxx.
---
Fake news?
---
Well what's the first best?
---
faster/easier is how we got retail tbh
---
would you use the addon that solves your rotation and tells you which button to press?
---
I enjoyed BC about as much as I did vanilla, so I'd be happy to see it return at some point, but I never cared much for WotLK.  As is always pointed out, the real question then becomes how far do we go before drawing the line?  
---
However, one thing I haven't seen much talk on is what happens if they refuse to keep going.  I'm genuinely curious of people who are against expansions, what do you plan to do after years of playing vanilla?  Surely, you'll eventually run out of alts to level or goals to work towards?
---
I just want a nice UI. As someone who took great pride in designing neat, minimal and unobtrusive UI's with a square minimap and a nice chat font and visible enemy cast bars, I am dreading the default offering from Blizzard.
---
I’ll try this soon. Hopefully my friend I haven’t talked to in a few years isn’t still using my old Shaman.
---
He is
---
Awesome class. Very easy and efficient and simple, but still fun leveling. Dungeons you can just sit back and watch health bars and learn the encounters that way. Totally recommend.
---
So tier 3 hunter gear is the very best hunter gear I'll find in classic. Followed by tier 2. 
---
Did people ever pass up better looking gear if they thought the set looked ugly? IMO, the [Dragonstalker set](https://barrens.chat/images/tier/armorset_troll-male-hunter-t2.jpg looks a little too much like the [Kuddly Krab costume](https://imgur.com/WltFOg9) for my liking.
---
Same can be said to what you just said.
---
Look at that hp inflation
---
yup!
---
