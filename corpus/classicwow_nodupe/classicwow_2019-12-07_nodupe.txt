So what happened exactly and why?
---
---
---
Replace "plague" with "depleted uranium weapons" and that sounds a lot like US foreign policy
---
Haha, Trust me. You don't wanna mess with us on Mograine :D
---
Great mentality you got there buddy. I wish more players were like this /s
---
I guess they could only allow gear to be equipped in dungeons.  that doesn't sound very fun though.
---

---
If you're gonna bend that over backwards to make memes viable just do the right thing of adjusting their talents.
---
Yup! Can't get any better
---
i blame blizzard. the system is broken and they dont care about the players one god dang bit. kind of sad
---
Ask someone to create level 1 character on another faction and scan AH.   
---
Compare with your scan, this will give you rough estimate.  
---
If there's 10k items on your AH, but 20k items on another faction AH - you could guess that it's 40/60 split.
---
Id tank ur way to a dps set and spec fury/prot so u can stay relevant in raids as a dps but also tank optimally. As a warrior u are always expected to tank in dungeons and expected to have a full dps set and tank set for raids. U picked the most complicated class but also the best at both roles. Devilsaur leather is cheap and Lionheart helm is bis for threat tanking and dps through all of classic. So grab those if u can. Dps gear is very similar to good threat tanking gear and if u do ur dls rotation with any skill it wont matter if u dont have a "full" dps set. Just always say when applying to guilds that u prefer to tank but can do both and they will give u offtank assignments in raids. 
---
Good raiders understand that u need to know how to manage all aspects of ur class to be good at end game content so if u say u dont dps then they will assume u cant hold threat either and most guilds are only looming for backup tanks who can pull big dps in raids.
---
Dude it's fiction, all they have to do is sell me on a story that ties into the gameplay they are working on. Of course it's gameplay first, it's a game. That being said, the story still works. Both the humans and the orcs are dealing with complex political situations that get introduced around like lvl 10-20.
---
Your macro just need /pet passive first
---
For some reason camping DM is rarely met with Horde retaliation where as poking Kargath guarantees 10-15 Horde showing up within 5 minutes since people can quickly hearth or fly in from Gromgol. So you end up having a steady stream of solo/duo lvl60s to farm honor out of, and all of them get killed 3-4 times through the long hallways at DM entrance.
---
I don’t use a macro, I recall pet with my regular binding.
---
"Well there were only a couple buffalo left and it's the only food source around so fuck it."
---
"We already cut down the rest of the trees, so fuck it." - some guy on Easter Island, probably
---
Realistically undead shouldn’t have been playable race
---
The one incentivized to do so by the honor system that blizzard launched?
---
This server is so depressing, hordes sit at balcony and kill lvl 1 tourists. The most pathetic shit ive ever witnessed.
---
Tbh this is normal. You can do raiding and pvp or anything to help with that (farming consumables, rep, etc). There will be more raid content later but you've in some sense beaten the current game when you've downed rag.
---
See, this is an interesting case of perception being the determining factor. When I read the screen-cap conversation, I thought you were the confusing participant and the seller was just trying to clarify your misstep.
---
Kinda cool.
---
What are the best classes for casual PvP? Like ones that don't require much gear or consumables/gadgets to be effective?
---
BROOOOO BG are literally just capture the flag???? Lmaoooo this is what y'all are excited for ?!  Lmaoooo holy shit. That is srsly a let down.
---
The ones that invaded the mines and probably slaughtered all the miners? Bunch of little rat shits
---
I used to play RuneScape and it's really hard not to roll my eyes when people in other games complain about grinding lol
---
But murdering and resurrecting the rest of Azeroth would just make more forsaken, so to them, that's a good thing. 
---
I don't think I would really call that evil tbh. Not outright bad for its own sake.
---
Good job! ^_^
---
If you transferred to Anathema, please have mercy on the horde because the population there was 65% alliance already and a lot of horde have stopped playing or resigned to leveling alts.
---
51 is perhaps a little too early but northern winterspring is usually quiet. At 54 brd becomes an option.
---
Keep doing what you're doing, get a dps set, or start your own guild; you already know all of the choices, now you just gotta make one.
---
Grenades are probably "attack spells" in the bitflags, which would use Physical Hit % instead of Spell Hit %.
---
OP was talking about the honor ranking system not the lack of BGs.  All the issues he talks about persist through the introduction of BGs.  In fact most of the things he talks about will worsen after Dec 10.  If you think the amount of honor the standing 1 earns is ludicrous now then just wait until he can queue for 10min wsg wins all day long.
---
I raided as an alliance Ret Pala for the entirety of TBC. I still don't understand how Blizzard decided it was fair that horde paladins just had a better Seal, period. And not even by a little, it was like a 150-200 dps difference. You'd think they learned their lessons when they decided to give alliance shaman and horde paladins, but no, let's have horde paladins do 15-20% more dps than alliance ones for the entirety of the expansion.
---
Yes I am still salty.
---
It totally depends on how good your tanks are. We have a druid tank who pops a gnomer mace on phase three, and it is impossible to catch them on threat.
---
P3 is a long ways away. Just play the warlock if you want but you should also remind yourself that post AQ is a **long** ways away.
---
Yeah its fucking awful. My server is around 70%horde30%ally and its fucking AWFUL. 
---
Want some herbs? Ore? To bad. Literally every zone is crawling with corpse campers. Want to do dungeons? GOOD LUCK! Took me FIFTEEN corpse runs to get from TP to BRD. FIFTH. TEEN. 
---
Want to fly somewhere? Guess what, even remote ass places like blasted lands, have FP campers. 
---
Want to use a boat? GG, you've encountered 5 UD rogues who will ride the boat with you and kill you all the way until you realize they already killed the FP in the next zone, and also have the GY camped. 
---
Its fucking awful bro. I love wpvp, but this isnt wpvp. It's a fucking massacre, everywhere. 
---
I've legit been stuck in a zone for an entire day, GY is camped, FPs are dead, and I shit you not an army of horde roaming the whole zone camping your corpse. I've logged off and got back on HOURS later... they're still there. Never before have I been literally unable to play a character because of the camping, its fucking awful. 
---
This amount of camping is only driving players away, how do people not see the dwindling population on their server and go.. eh fuck it. Let's ruin the server and the game.
---

Is it true that battlegrounds mode or whatever it's called is a really just capture the flag ?
---
I unsubbed about a month ago and was unable to list a reason, despite wanting to.
---
The idiot above you conveniently forgets gnome mage / gnome warlock because it’d immediately break his argument.
---
But ultimately people choose how they play the game, and how they respond to the incentives Blizzard provides.
---
1) The Orcs had no idea who the night elves were.
---
2) The Night Elves and Cenarius DID know what the Orcs were. They worked with Broxxigar Saurfang against the legion who is a hero for their people for striking blood against Sargeras and saving them all. 
---
3) He banded with the good forces, including an Orc.
---
4) Even though they knew Broxxigar came from their people, they were happy to commit genocide instead of sending a diplomatic party.
---
5) he thought he needed to in order for his troops and him to survive and win.
---
The Elves has all the cards and knowledge.
---
And not only logically should they have not fought due to knowing Cenarius is wrong because of Broxxigar. But they went for genocide anyway AND LOST. Cenarius rightfully got fucking rekt.
---
What about all the people who missed the free transfer? There's absolutely people who didn't choose to stay but just missed the boat.
---
Yep, the guy Vicious. He was a dbag too. Most people I know have already blacklisted him and ignore his listings on the ah due to his dbagery.
---
I have a question, as a horde player, why would you want to stay on this server. You have pushed all the alliance off but now you can’t participate in a huge aspect of the game. AQ will be impossible and you are now alone in the world without an enemy.
---
:(
---
For the classes I play I sort of hated Naxx itemization because it was so lazy. As an example, the Shaman T3 set is literally only Intellect, Stamina, MP5 and +Healing. Every single piece. For class that has 3 different specs it pigeonholes every Shaman into healing if they want to raid at that level. Same goes for Druid gear. 
---
Mages, Warlocks and all the "single spec" style classes love that gear because it's just a flat upgrade over every other piece in the game. For any multi-spec or hybrid type class the gear is pure shit.
---
Austrian, not Australian! 😂😂😂
---
Yup, people comitted to running a group look for more people to join them, nobody trolls lfg channel looking for a fill for last spot, they spam once and get 30 dps whispers, then spam for another 20 mins to find a tank or heals then they run it, lfg statements might as well be nothing. It says i want to he carried through this dungeon without any work, where as lfm says i need some people to help me clear this dungeon together
---
There are better chest pieces you can farm (deathbone, SGC or Chromatic if you're lucky). The neck is about the best until ony neck
---
Statistics say otherwise
---
Welp, you won the war. Enjoy your empty server.
---
Got mine for 5g a few months ago. Now they are like 25-35.
---
They're probably not in Leftovers.
---
This is exactly it. Great post. I'd been trying to remember the proper name for Tragedy of the Commons for the last week, as it perfectly explains the situation. To expand on your post I'd say that the competition in this PvP system is not against the opposite faction; it is against our own faction. As such, 90% of people may agree that camping FPs is weak and boring but, if it's efficient and even 1% of the competition are camping FPs, then one either falls on the sword of ethics or one joins in and continue ranking. 
---
I'd attribute much more of the blame toward layering and megaservers than you did but a lack of BGs and the honor system itself are definitely ingredients in the shit stew that Classic has become.
---
They will probably follow and change server too.
---
Didn't the night elves start major shit when the orcs started chopping down their trees in azshara? It would take a lot of effort to go back from that, considering what'shisname killed cenarius.
---
And if I remember correctly, paladins and the entire light thing doesn't mesh well with undead, especially not their plans to destroy azeroth with the plague. Which, I guess, becomes a moot point real fast in WOTLK but this is classic. Otherwise, yeah, the undead are basically just dead humans that were freed from the lich king. Tons of those in wrath.
---
Just getting the true classic experience ;)
---
Tanks tend toward the leadership role in a guild, it's not surprising there isn't a large amount of room for them. Having said that plenty of fights require 5+ tanks on, you just need a guild for said content because pugging vanilla content isn't as easy as a large amount of the forums tend to argue
---
my half assed sim says arms is like 400dps and fury is like 500. so that is a significant difference. You might make it up on aoe fights, though. I don’t think it matters much either way in the end. a plus would be that you’re not competing with rogues and the other warriors for weapons -maybe you can sell it that way?
---
&gt; Wrath of Ragnaros - Melee Knockback
---
25s cooldown. "Taste the Flames of Sulfuron!" .When this ability is used characters in melee range are sent flying, much like Garr's guardians when they die. This also reduces threat of the targets it does hit.
---
* https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Ragnaros_(tactics)
---
The bug is that it reduces the threat of everyone regardless of whether they were hit or even out of range. I don't have a linkable source for this but guilds that don't play around this bug surely must have noticed Ragnaros randomly turning around and killing a melee DPS even when the tank doesn't get knocked away.
---
I would even consider HoTW resto spec as a off tank.
---
No. There are 3 different battlegrounds in the game. One of battleground - war song gulch, is a CTF. It will be first BG.
---
Just look at the drop in amount of players dince p2, easily googleable, at bgs ppl will come back then its slowly gonna fade until tbc/classic+ and come alive.
---
My son turns three in May. I’m taking this mindset with me for the future. “ only play with me if you want to “ it’s a great thought process. Thank you for this. Best of luck for you and your family moving forward.
---
I mean if the game makes corpse camping the best way to earn honor then why blame the players.. why not blame the rulemaker aka blizzard.
---
I'm surprised y'all can even find 15 people to kill in a week to hit the board tbh. Probably won't be able to keep it up long with the unsustainable farming but you do you.
---
You lvl your weaponskill faster with more int.  So it does help!
---
Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should.
---
No. Alliance is the PVE faction. Not PvP. Paladins in PvP don’t bring as much as Shamans. Ele and hybrid specs bring so much. Also Stun Resist is insane. And WOTF is NOT canceled out by Fear Ward. There’s a reason a lot of Warlocks don’t like fighting Forsaken and priests are just kinda Ehh including dwarf priests.
---
Canonically, we cannot, Resurrection in the Warcraft universe is still rare.
---
It's just a gameplay mechanic, nothing more.
---
I posted this in another thread:
---
First question was about putting talent points into Feral Instinct while leveling for threat. The second question was about when to change specs I think.
---
1. Not important at lower levels. Even at 60, you can do without the 15% threat until you start getting geared dps that do 250-300+ dps single target. You can respec into 15% threat once you're closer to 60+ content. I didn't need it until 2-3 weeks of being 60 and grinding out pre-bis gear for the guild, so I don't think you would need it if you're leveling through tanking dungeons with similarly geared partymembers.
---
2. Level to 60 committing to deep feral, then respec once you start maintanking dungeons or entering raids as a MT/OT more than questing. I started this transition around lvl 55 for BRD/Strat/Scholo.
---
Generally, Druid leveling talent progression starts with b-lining to Feline Swiftness for the 30% movespeed for questing QOL. I'd go 5/5 Ferocity &gt; 5/5 Thick Hide &gt; 2/2 Feline Swiftness. The reasons why you'd go Thick Hide for the 10% armor over the 15% threat are 1) you don't need the threat at this stage and until post-60, and 2) you benefit from the 10% armor both while questing and dungeoning. The extra reduction in stealth detection that comes with the 15% threat frankly felt negligible to me. I never felt like I really needed it, whereas the 10% armor is always on and always in effect when you need it, and you always will when you're in combat, questing or dungeoning.
---
From here, there's mainly two options:
---
a. Continue to invest in the Feral Talent Tree and make a b-line for Faerie Fire (Feral), which frankly is both a DPS increase and a QOL in one.
---
To do this, I'd go 3/3 Sharpened Claws &gt; 2/2 Blood Frenzy &gt; 1/1 Feral Charge &gt; 3/3 Predatory Strikes &gt; 1/1 Faerie Fire (Feral)
---
b. Switch over to the Restoration Talent Tree and go 5/5 Furor, maybe throw in 1/1 Feral Charge for the utility as well before or after the 5/5 Furor.
---
I chose to go with option a, and kick the 5/5 Furor can down the road.
---
If you chose option a as well, then you have to ask the same 5/5 Furor question after reaching Faerie Fire (Feral). It becomes another two options scenario:
---
a. Continue through the Feral Talent Tree to make a b-line to Leader of the Pack.
---
To do this, go 2/2 Savage Fury &gt; 2/2 Primal Fury &gt; 5/5 Heart of the Wild &gt; 1/1 Leader of the Pack
---
b. Switch over to the Resto Tree and do the 5/5 Furor first, then go to b-line to Leader of the Pack.
---
I chose to go with option a, again. It was cumbersome not having the 5/5 Furor for the starting energy/rage, but it was something I was able to work into my gameplay style so that I can reap the earlier rewards of the increase damage output from investing in the Feral tree to reach Leader of the Pack.
---
At this point, you can switch over to the Balance Talent Tree to make a b-line for Omen of Clarity:
---
To do this, go 1/1 Nature's Grasp &gt; 4/4 Improved Nature's Grasp &gt; 5/5 Natural Weapons &gt; 1/1 Omen of Clarity
---
By now, your talent tree should look something like this: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5000521303222151-05](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5000521303222151-05), leaving you 3 points.
---
I chose to invest the 3 points into the Balance Talent Tree's 3/3 Natural Shapeshifter. I think the manacost reduction to shapeshift as a druid tank is invaluable for my playstyle, since I macro shapeshift pots, innervate, holy water throws, after pulls I heal/hot my partymembers (especially life tapping warlocks), etc.
---
At this point, you're pretty much full bear-tank mode with the ability to still dps in cat form. To fully maximize your bear tanking talents, you need to take out the 2/2 in the cat-only talent points from Blood Frenzy, as well as the 2/2 in Feline Swiftness. This means respeccing time to reallocate 4 talent points, with the optional 1 talent point more that I personally pull from Thick Hide.
---
So, I took 2/2 out of Blood Frenzy, since I don't cat dps, and put it into Feral Instinct to get 2/5. I also took out 2 points from Feline Swiftness as I didn't need the cat movement speed anymore and put it into Feral Instinct to get 4/5. To fill up the remaining 1 point of Feral Instinct for the 15% threat, I did a lot of research/calculating, and ultimately pulled 1 point out of Thick Hide and transferred it over to get 5/5 Feral Instinct.
---
I actually took another 1 point out of Thick Hide and put it in the Restoration Talent Tree's Improved Enrage to get 1/2. I like the extra +5 rage you get when popping Enraged, which I use on CD every fight. The +5 is significant for druid tanks, as you get +10 from Furor, and popping Enrage with +5 gets you to 15 rage, which is the cost of your AOE Taunt/Challenging Roar.
---
My end build that tanks ALL MC bosses and also solo-tanks Ragnoras is:

---
This is an odd question.  You're on a subreddit on a game people have to go on themselves. Chances are people on here are enjoying  the game
---
I would LOVE to see the unnerfed skeletons in Classic.
---
Sigh :(
---
Some of us have cancelled our subs and told blizz why. Not every horde is a dick, just most lol
---
Nah fuck them they deserve 10 minute queues
---
I'm gonna disagree with the consensus here, I think Shockadin has its place. With the auto-crit its a guaranteed ~800 instant ranged damage that isn't resistible by players past the base 5% chance, which makes it suuuper nice for securing kills as a PVP frontline pally.
---
I wouldn't say they feel nothing. It's more like they have to let go of their old life. Blizz has showed us they wish for their old lives back with questlines. Most notably the undelivered letter questline in classic Tirisfal Glades, and with whole fiasco with Calia menethil in I think it was before the storm.
---
Lists are notoriously unreliable because each class and spec is different and the gear needs of each player are often based on the other gear they have equipped already. Breakpoints like hit chance drastically change which items are bis for which classes at different points
---
im undead, so if i am rank 3 can i buy the epic horse 100g cheaper right now?

---
A copy from another comment in a similar thread
---
Minor grammarnazi thing but I'm pretty sure the phrase is "stands to reason"
---
Tank dungeons and ask people every run if their guilds are looking for tanks. Your best chances are joining a progression guild that isn't all lvl 60 and ready to raid yet but are trying to build a group. Otherwise you'll just have to get lucky and land a spot on a raid team that had a tank that bailed on them.
---
That sounds so much more badass than "for the alliance"
---
How dare you patronise glitteringworld8, the king of comedy.
---
But that's only possible because of poor population balance, which is blizzards fault.
---
&gt;the world never felt like this
---
Because relative to the total number of players, no one was pre-making guilds and selecting a server based on faction poll data weeks before the game launched.  Whatever the faction balance was that's what you played on because the vast majority of folks didn't want to restart and server moves weren't a thing.
---
Have not played in a while on Heartseeker, do the alliance still overwhelm us completely or can I actually play the game now?
---
yeah, get it. try mace spec or maybe even 2h fury and see how you like it. but i remember in vanilla, it made a big difference when i upgraded from a blue axe to TUF.
---
Rank 3 applies an additional 10% discount, so you get the 10% from honored, and then 10% from being rank 3 or higher in pvp.
---
This means instead of 1000g, you would only need 800g, if you are both honored with your own reputation(Which you should be) and are rank 3 or above, this applies to all races.
---
We can also add a Hyjal raid to the list. The Hyjal map is already half built in vanilla anyways. Make it about the last hold outs of The Burning Legion after the battle of Mount Hyjal.
---
The Burning Legion really didn't see enough screen time in vanilla despite being the big bad in lore.
---
Noted. I'm part imbecile.
---
TBH PVP in vanilla was fun.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But it was much more limited and much less zergy and much less dickbaggy.
---
It was more of a "THATS THE FUCKING ROGUE THAT KILLED ME" kind of rivalry and then you saw eachother in the forums and were like " :O ! "  
---
Right now it's just an absolute grief fest. It's so much more toxic than vanilla it's crazy. Different generation tbh.
---
&gt;  Given the min max attitude in modern day + classic, all of the sweaty pvp minmaxers rolled horde and took engineering.
---
Anyone who understands competitive pvp, rolled alliance for premades.
---
The SHEEP just saw racials and thought "OMG OP" and rolled horde. Little do they know, how strong paladins ACTUALLY are.
---
&gt; you do have the choice to not engage in such behavior.
---
Sure. But let's say you let that 48 go. Five seconds later he's ganked by a rogue. That rogue is now further ahead than you. 
---
That's the insanity of the system. It punishes you for being fair. By competing with your own faction for ranking you're pushed by the very design of the system to tag every enemy you see, because if you don't harvest that resource, someone else will.
---
Acting like people didn’t predict this was going to happen. Would I buy a car blindly knowing that critical issues exist in previous models? Nope. But I also wouldn’t devote 20 days of /played into a game that’s 3? Months old. But that’s just me I guess. 
---
I’m not saying it’s not a shitty situation, cause it is and I’d be just as upset. But at the end of the day it’s a video game...
---
I don't but I missed the transfers. Same with friends
---
True. Spending my dkp on gear not weapons. I'm pulling more dps then the mages with the blade and no other epics. I'm at 6 epics total and i got 3 set t1
---
These days perverts satisfy thier elf lust by looking at lewd fan art
---
Happens more often than you might think. Keep posted on your servers discord
---
It's pretty much objectively the case that putting in 16 hours in a mediocre premade winning half their games will net you more honor than putting 8 hours into a top premade winning 90%. Not to mention the fact that if you're in it for 16 hours a day, you're most likely going to have enough gear and basic button-pushing abilities that will get you into the top premades.
---
Or maybe you would consider that "skill"? Keep deluding yourself.
---
&gt;mr agenda pusher
---
Also you're having a discussion on Reddit. What even is the point of this remark?
---
fortunately i saved it.  i'll post the link when i get home
---
Every time people suggested a change to the honour system, the #nochanges crowd drowned them out. Blizzard is just doing what they thought the community wanted.
---
I believe MS is a low priority debuff, it should be knocked off for any dots
---
yeah, you just proved my point that theres an argument against twinking as it makes lower level brackets nearly unplayable.
---
i dont support that position because twinking is fun and one has every right to pimp out a lvl 19, 29, etc. character but i'm saying that what /u/w00ms said was dumb
---
Imagine needing* people to spell out that it doesn’t mean all horde players are the problem, but horde doing this is a much more frequent problem than alliance.
---
I did some googling and got this from the Icy Veins spoilers.
---
“As a result, Sylvanas starts going bonkers, claiming that the meeting was a setup to overthrow her and put Calia on the throne. She does not blame Anduin, because he's surprised to see Calia there, so that was definitely not planned”
---
Bigglesworth is 60/40 in favor of horde. I wouldn'tcall that even.
---
&gt;not already having 5 60s and doing 5 split raids per week
---
pretty cringe bro
---
I AM MURLOC!
---
I only found the link from a different comment when I searched for this exact topic a few days ago.
---
Other than battle net friends it seems to be the same. Well except it’s set up like the last patches not released as they happened for like bugs and such so balance is end of vanilla
---
It happened via magic of discord
---
Ah I found videos explaining it finally. AV is what I expected from BG or something similar. WSG sounds like a complete snooze fest. I mean capture the flag? Really? Lol wtf.
---
And I have downvoted.
---
Now go back to your bridge.
---
Huaeh, get do de choppa!
---
Any zone you go to is most likely ran by horde, especially BRM. You will see horde afk there sometimes. I guarantee you will never find any alliance player dare to ask at brm. Lol
---
That's a fair point.
---
Fitting
---
[removed]
---
Dare to afk*
---
Yeah, those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
How is Spirit Tap a PvP talent? HK's dont grant XP no?
---
Bit of an extreme example there. Obviosuly should be going to maintank but your point is understood. However, using a dkp, you should let anyone with enough points buy it if they want it. I've read about some hunters gathering up some +SP to boost their arcane shots, and not using aimed shot at all. Allowing them to keep improved aspect of the hawk up and get more white damage shots in. 
---
But thats is also subjective to your guild. Does everyone have to be min/max or can they experiment and try out meme specs if theyre willing to put forth the effort. The rise of spelladins has shown that with enough willpower, ret can be *viable* but not in top dps charts. 
---
At the end of the day, you can loot prio gear (class tiers) and probably the choker of the firelord, as well a few dps rings. But I feel that with a dkp system is the holy priest wants that choker for offspec pvp, then should be allowed to bid on it. Provided they are already well geared, i.e. not wearing all pre raid BiS and mad saving dkp just for giggles.
---
I play there every day, its high pop righ now 1:30 at night
---
Thanks! I totally missed that Smite was included in Divine Fury...
---
Just because they don't on your shitty server doesn't mean that others don't on more balanced realms
---
i am hotw spec (0/30/21) with no cat talents, so i can tank or heal. I like that. 
---
i am almost never in a situation where i have to dps. but i guess you wouldn’t want to heal. still, almost all the time people want you to tank. I certainly wouldn’t sacfrifice any bear stuff. if you have 2 points you could get improved shred maybe... but no matter what you do your dps will suck. whereas if you go for the bear talents you can be a good tank.
---
Pretty much. It's fun though.
---
wait what. are you sure about this? never heard about female tauren having smaller hitboxes.
---
Huh guess I better just recruit my own personal premade
---
Guides are shit.
---
Do it. Just go PVE as a first timer. Or horde on a pvp.
---
Imo, today's pvp servers are nothing like the vanilla experience
---
Taurens allying themselves with the Horde was part of the Orc campaign in WC3: Reign of Chaos. Taurens were at war with Centaurs, and Centaurs were immediately hostile to the Horde after Thrall &amp; co. landed in Kalimdor following Medivh's vision (while Jaina also followed the vision to Kalimdor at the same time). So Thrall aided the Taurens against Centaurs and thus gained a new ally.
---
Founding of Durotar (where Daelin Proudmoore was killed at the end) occurred after main events in Reign of Chaos, and the Tauren hero you play in that campaign was Caine's son, Baine.
---
Only realm that isn't Medium, High or Full is the Spanish one.
---
&gt; It's actually super easy, there's always a lot of people doing Mara  
---
Reaaaaaaaaaally depend of the server
---
Can someone recommend a **nameplate add-on with debuff/aura durations on the plates?**
---
Similar to KUI but with some indication of the time left on the debuff/aura (like sunder)
---
lmao.. a bunch of thinly veiled insults and general "us vs them" prejudice.
---
The population drop from both sides obviously has nothing to do with how poorly Blizzard managed the release of classic.. No, of course not.. it's because "all the alliance are pussies"
---
What a joke.
---
That does sound boring
---
On my 60 mage I only hit 1700+ twice most of the time it was outputting almost the same damage as my frostbolt. So I kinda got over DR pretty quickly. But now as a rogue they seem more useful cus of gouge. Btw can I buy sappers from other ppl.
---
Try the harpies south of decolase , north of feather moon stronghold, lvl 48-50 and easy to kill. They give around 500 exp rested. Never seen a lvl 60 there.
---
its a nice robe tho
---
I don't know about gear contention, with 3 MTs, somehow as a fury warriors i am getting tier 1s and 2 because they are long geared up. 
---
granted my original plan was to just sell my services, but now i am the emergency off tank when our feral kitty / bear goes awol 
---
pls come back me no good tnk
---
I'm not saying it's shit by any means. I think it's cute. But nobody uses it like they do Peg. It's a poor comparison. It's like saying 30000 people visited McDonald's locations in California today but only 9 people visited joe's fart sandwiches in a small town in Nebraska.
---
Do you realize what a condescending turd you sound like? He's explained several times why he got the weapon, and it's extremely defensible.
---
I haven't been able to be convinced to ever put points into Blessed Recovery. It just doesn't seem like that much healing at all. Other than that, you can take 1 point out of fort since dispels happen often, and you can take some points out of spell warding.
---
I think it's the players too. I don't think priest camp boats to MC lowbies off in the middle of the sea for honor lol. Pretty sure it's for attention and a cry for help.
---
We *almost* played on Herod, had all our names pre-picked and everything, but then the GM decided to change because Herod was gonna be so crowded. We decided to go incendius (which ended up being full as fuck anyway but w/e). I’m really glad we ended up here though, love it.
---
It was more of a commentary on the fact that people would rather make posts about popular topics for the upvotes than follow your advice/example
---
Do you realize the camping wouldn't have been an issue if server imbalance wasn't a problem?
---
People attach way too much meaning to the arbitrary choice of the blue team or the red team.

I would say when it's 1v1 i tend to win most everytime, but you still have a few fantastic players man..  The issues is as you said - the raid farming.  You land a FP and get wrecked by 10 dudes.  You need to go to Dire maul or BRM - LITERALLY RAIDS camping it.  Gets old - has to be boring.   I love pvp and would not honor farm like that ever.  At best i would plant a rogue in BRM and get in on some old school lawls.
---
Other servers will go like this soon too, if blizzard doesn't do anything
---
like a pve server ?
---
Wait until the 10th when you see how the honor system rewards not only trash players but trash players who account share or form tight knit mafia style cabals to monopolize brackets and collude for a turn based rank 14 system.
---
the honor system starts making more sense with the battlegrounds. the current state of world pvp that is getting a lot of heat is about to die forever and will be nothing but an echo of a failed little period in the wow classic timeline.
---
sadly everyone *is* a judgmental fuck nowadays
---
Locking someone into a honor camping fest for 20 minutes is sadism and has little to do with farming honor efficiently. I get more honor pvping in E plaguelands with a group of 5 for 2 hours than you pathetic people are getting from corpse camping lvl 58s on the way to BRD for a whole day.
---
Horde Grunt: ..Are we bad people?
---
Gruber: [swallows] It's a matter of perspective, really.
---
Horde Grunt: From these men's perspective?
---
Gruber: Oh, absolutely! But, to be fair.. I think we kind of tipped that Jenga tower by being Orcs in the first place.
---
Yeah I'm being a pessimist about it cause I've played literally years of CTF on Halo lol
---
Also works for alliance as horde on my sever, camp DM with 20+ every night for 6+ hours.
---
People are playing towards the goal of the honor system. They are literally following the rules of the game in order to get rewards.
---
Im horde in incendius. In my experience it is well balanced. Make sure that you are aware that the server has among the highest populations so there is little down time between pvp battles if you want to say grind mobs or herb/mine etc.
---
I rolled horde on Flamelash because it was a nice highly populated server with a good h/a ratio. After month of progression it turns out everything was for nothing because the server is completely destroyed right now. Blizz proved again how clueless and bad they are at what they do. Its not the players fault for grinding honor, hell I’m not even 60 and I’ve spent the last 10 levels in dungeons because of blizz’ dumb decision to put honor in the game without BGs. If I was alliance I would have transferred too. FU blizz, hope you bankrupt soon..
---
This is a common misconception that I even had to correct my Guild’s MT on. Agility only provides warriors with RANGED AP. This is why strength is about twice as good as agility for dps warriors.
---
Lok’tar friend. We all need to get our HKs up lol, I’m only a lowly sergeant. Though someone in my guild is blood guard ( he might be the next rank actually, I think he was blood guard last week), think he’s one of the top pvpers on the server. Naturally he’s a warrior lmao
---
What weapon in the game has the most +Spirit?
---
Yeah fuck my bad misunderstood it lol
---
Look sorry not trying to be a total dick, but if twitch was around 10 years ago, he would be a top 10 streamer for sure.  This guy has several youtube videos with over 100k views, along with dozens of threads about him over the last 10 years.
---
well, it can be used by hunters, so it's obviously a hunter weapon
---
There is an add-on that mutes Looking For Group while in a dungeon but I don't remember the name of it, does anyone recall what it's called?
---
I always imagine it as a fat man with a mustang under his mouth.
---
I severely doubt it. If it's true then you will have no problem getting rank 14 before all the horde. Good job finding an efficient system.
---
not rogues yes, but aren't fury warriors looking for big 2 handers, or do they usually DW too? If I don't compete with them, then only ret pallies and maybe hunters would roll against me :)
---
More important than breaking the fears?
---
Youre just plain ignorant. Mechanic that promotes this kind of behaviour In a game where the factions are a big part of it is just fucking bad.
---
**For warrior tanks:** how do you know if party members are using threat abilities like growl and mind blast? I know growl doesn't show a debuff and mind blast only shows a debuff sometimes, so how do you call it out?
---
So it’s more balanced now?
---
Yeah but that relies more on engineering than being a holy pally. Sadly, without engi it isn’t really that good. You need gear that isn’t out yet. 
---
I absolutely think it would be fun though if you get the engineering items.
---
Yawn
---
Do you just keep your character naked to avoid durability loss?
---
Welcome to philosophy.
---
I don’t care about your questions, as this thread is all about warriors, which means it’s all about ME!
---
Thank you.
---
I bet they follow this debacle up with "See I told you, you thought you did, but you didn't".   To them I reply, I thought you could learn from the last 15 years and not make the same mistakes Vanilla did, but you didn't.
---
I think his cast bar is quartz
---
5 minutes ALIVE. They were camping the portals and entrances so people couldn’t unflag.
---
Right.. you haven't lost it either though
---
*taps forehead*
---
Shamans never fall out flavor, they will be in demand even during Phase 6. I say go for it!
---
Just some allies blowing shot out of proportion and doing knee jerk transfer after they find out what pvp server means. 
---
Just children throwing a fit.
---
Can't you just look at your dps meter and see the breakdown by ability? I mean, your party members are hopefully not using threat abilities that don't do damage.
---
5 minutes is plenty to get you killed.
---
Okay, I’ll get started on the dps gear then. It seems like a good idea to just go in as a dps warrior and try to work my way up to a tank position.
---
Hmm 200+ points a pop vs what? 10-15? Depending on the group size? With diminishing returns?
---
From [Wowpedia](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Hillsbrad_Foothills_(Classic)#Geography):
---
"Though the rest of [Lordaeron](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lordaeron) was ravaged by the Scourge and twisted into a haunted perversion of its former self, the Hillsbrad Foothills largely managed to escape this fate. It remains the best preserved region of the fallen kingdom, giving travelers a feeling for what the land was like before the Plague."
---
If you're using sinister strike I'm assuming you are PVE sword spec?  If so you should lose to any equally or better skilled frost mage in the majority of cases. This is simply due to attrition and your inability to restealth quickly, double vanish/blind/sprint etc. in which case FAPs are your friend.
---
After your opener it's going to vary to the point where I could make an actual flow chart - did they blink while gouged, did they iceblock, have they nova'ed, have I been pom sheeped etc. so I don't have a "this is what I do in almost every case" like I do with other classes.
---
I'm well geared hemo and even with CDs, engineering &amp; trinket they are a tough fight if I don't just use a FAP to put an end to the slows.
---
Yeah, increasing the population cap was a bad idea.
---
We heavily outnumber alliance on our server but there are still days where I spend more time dead than alive. Questing in Felwood and Winterspring was especially bad.
---
Alliance can't even quest on our server. I literally haven't seen any of them questing since I left STV a couple weeks ago.
---
I quit before P2, but would always leave hordies alone when questing, you know unless I could feel we both wanted a scrape. But if I saw an UD rogue, I jumped him asap.
---
I'm a fair player, but I'm not an idiot
---
Who ever made this doent know that the three women literally beat kurt Russell to death...
---
In my experience, Strat Live is #1. The mob packs are filled with healers, mobs that charge you into other packs, mobs that run for help. Combine that with the skelly squads that arrive directly into your asshole and you have a recipe for trouble.  
---
  
---
LBRS has a couple of tricky pulls, but it's kind of hard to wipe in my experience.
---
This is the best thing I’ve read all year.
---
Please don't remind me. It's all I can do just to get out of bed in the morning.
---
Deep
---
Even meth?
---
&gt;ally who server hopped because 45/55 was too much of an imbalance
---
Ok, where is the data to say that happened for that reason?  
---
Is that why they opened the server transfers up? because horde were dominating?  Or was it because of queues?
---
Right, which is why "shockadin" isn't anything other than a meme spec atm. It's
---
Sorry for the dumb question but in this context is nameplates the addon and you'd add a weakaura to add durations to the debuffs/auras?
---
#nochanges
---
Yea true gear is huge difference maker but the amount of burst on a target swap will always be huge. Pallies do provide freedom,bop and have bubble.
---
You have issues dude. It's kind of pathetic how you go out and make these incredibly low effort, brainless comments on every thread about balance
---
What you guys need to do is work together to gear up a bunch of level 19 twinks and never go in a contested zone again.
---
Let him pay money to transfer? What's with the Stockholm syndrome of wow? It's like asking to pay for a patch to fix a game breaking bug as a DLC.
---
Do you have class leads?  Ideally you would have knowledgeable class leads provide lists of BiS for each of their class' specs so it doesn't all fall on the GM.
---
As a warrior I agree with this
---
Ahhh really?? Lot of misinformation spreading around then, thanks for clearing that up man.
---
And because he's been too lazy (lack of time?) to farm the actual upgrades. There are several weapons you can get without too much fuzz that are quite a bit better than Hypnotic Blade. Any green item with 15+ spell damage, Witchblade, Mind Carver, Rod of the Ogre Magi etc.
---
I still try to buff every Ally I come across with MotW.
---
And then beg the first mage I meet for more water.
---
So true, had many horde fishing buddies, and many good lighthearted tussles, but I quit before P2, thank God for that.
---
To be fair he'd need like 8 pyroblasts to kill you anyway.
---
Good point.
---
Being able to survive an accidental top floor pull during the rend event speaks to how much easier UBRS has become. Instead of an instant wipe it just makes the event challenging.
---
lmao
---
It's a local webpage for a browser. I halted development on it for now due to IRL stuff but thanks for the interest!
---
Been happening on stalagg too especially in SW
---
Nooooooo how could you think that?
---
I believe the mode was PvM, or players vs monsters. Really cool concept that didn’t gain much traction, unfortunately.
---
That solution isn't crazy though. They need to put that in place on all servers.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?realm=4700_Kirtonos
---
(Example, my realm)
---
The population shows even in terms of characters, but if you check activity, it shows VERY lopsided numbers of players who are actually active at a given time. (3:1 typically).
---
The population numbers aren't always correct, as there may be incomplete census data over a longer period of time, whereas you can look at activity data from a given day, and you can sometimes pull decent idea of the factions from there.
---
Moonkin with ns. Instant wrath op power
---
Terrorists win
---
&gt; ally tears
---
It's so cringe that you believe there is a such thing as alliance vs horde.
---
I bet you have a WoW tattoo and a bumper sticker.
---
Get a grip on reality lmao
---
Yes. Can confirm. That is Tanaris.
---
That's not how it works.
---
Someone could start farming honor in a month and get past you fast. The honor system only cares about what you have done in the past week for placement in the brackets, what you did last month doesn't matter as you will be hit by decay for not being active enough right now.
---
Right?  It’s really amazing how these 40 year old virgins feel some kind of superiority because they picked one of the more popular fantasy races and ignore the actual issues.
---
Well your internet lingo suggest you don't Lololololol ;)
---
Yeah, I know.  The new demon models and new armors ruined it for me though.
---
You can't look at the sick new demons and then go back to tiny pube monkey or purple blob, or GTA 3 prostitute.
---
I've lost my pre-raid buffs 2 times to alliance camping the MC window. I also had to corpse hop 4 deaths to get my quintessence. I'll admit that horde does tend to have BRM on lockdown, but alliance almost always had a raid right outside kargath, and when I fly to BS there's like an 80% chance I land into a rogue stunlock. 
---
Again, I definitely think that horde has a bit of a numbers advantage. However, a lot of the horde PVPers are dedicated to keeping BRM on lockdown. Because those PVPers are occupied, I think the alliance has equal standing, or possibly even an advantage when it comes to the rest of the world.
---
In other words, if the server really is 60/40, I think at least 1/3 (i.e. 20 of that 60) of horde PVPers stick around BRM, which means for the rest of the zones the alliance will be on equal footing, or even a bit of an advantage.
---
Don't throw snowballs if you live in a iglo
---
Yes. In original Vanilla days I piggybacked in AQ40/Naxx with it.
---
I may be missing a joke but are you actually saying Blizzard should not step in and do something to fix this problem bc of #nochanges ?
---
Not to get all “real life” on it but blaming large scale structural problems in a country on individual secret lizards manipulating everything is a fairly weak social perspective
---
"At the moment"
---
Nah, they joined Thrall because the Barrens were being overrun by centaur. The affair with Daelin Proudmore was after the events of WC3 and maybe even after the events of TFT.
---
1 guy likes it. 9 dont. You seem to gravitate towards views aligned with your own. That's natural,but I am confused, what was the purpose of your post? To reinforce your existing views?
---
The Lord works in mysterious ways
---
I think he said [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker].
---
Or org is a shit place for alliance to be.  Kek.
---
You are making your healer angry by splitting damage, I assure you.
---
Lol, no. It's what players do. If players are acting a certain way it's because a world has been created for them to act as such in. 
---
You can't hold faceless people to unrealistic standards and be surprised when people don't act like that. It's even less forgivable in this instance because they are rereleasing the game and thus had more opportunities than ever to address 15 year old design flaws.
---
lol my server doesnt even allow alliance to transfer off it otherwise im sure this would happen too
---
I just wait for the rest of my gank squad to catch up.
---
&gt; form tight knit mafia style cabals to monopolize brackets and collude for a turn based rank 14 system
---
Is that supposed to be a bad thing?
---
The Horde are everywhere. The only reason it seems like there are so many people here is because all of these people have to raid Tuesday and cap the server off because they can't wait one more day to raid. Tuesday evening there was a queue around 1400 at around 6pm when I logged on. The very next day at the same time there was no queue.
---
But like I said Horde are everywhere. There are so many of them. I was in Winterspring 2 days ago and there were about 20-25 horde in town killing the 3 or 4 alliance players that were there right in the middle of town.
---
I had to go to Lights Hope Chapel yesterday and I saw another 20+ horde players and maybe 2 other alliance players getting killed just like I was.
---
Searing Gorge or Burning Steppes? You're gonna have a bad time. I can't even take a boat without running into a Horde gank squad.
---
I love world PvP but right now there are just too many Horde players on Herod there isn't much you can do unless you are in a group just to PvP. I started classic a little late and I didn't know the server populations were going to be so high. I just went to Herod because that is where my friends were already playing. There is definitely a good amount of alliance but the Horde are far greater in number.
---
Lionheart helm or epic mount?
---
On retail I got grouped with an oceanic player in rdf. Instead of him having horrible ping, all the NA players were pulled to the oceanic server... 
---
Yeah having high ping isn’t fun.
---
Sulfuras.
---
And scatter DRs trap...smh...
---
How can you be so sure?
---
*Suffering*? Spare me the melodrama, fucking hell. 
---
It's amusing that people who are callous about what alliance players have been having to deal with are so defensive when you raise the specter of punitive queue times for horde players. 
---
It's not about causing sUfFeRiNg; it's about trying something to fix the game. It wouldn't be enough, but it might help. They certainly have to look into solutions.
---
It feels like a 90’s punk band?
---
You don't need any points in prot to tank end game dungeons. Just spec for pvp and do dungeons with those talents, the content is not that hard. Also, whatever talent tree you're making, if you don't put 5/5 in cruelty you're wrong. Crit is way too good. GLHF in BGs man, and be nice to your pocket healer.
---
Benediction! So sparkly
---
Respec. Try min/maxing the shit out of your character. You didn't mention dungeons for prebis which can be fun but some people dont like.  Find a guild for mc, it's only a couple hours per week. Look up the best craftables/boe's for your class and set them as goals for yourself.
---
Would make pvp more interesting with a loss of gear or something
---
Level a mage and use him to AoE farm. You'll make far more money long term with less effort.
---
Weird how their posts are getting upvoted and your post is getting downvoted, then.
---
It's literally the textbook definition of the paradox of tolerance. It's not supposed to be deep or meaningful, it's explaining the paradox.
---
The population isn't fucked.  The server is fine.  Skeram is a very unique server.  I'd go as far as to say we have the highest population of experienced private server players.  These experienced private server players are very very good at taking advantage of those with much less experience.  The ones with much less experience are the ones you see making these reddit posts.
---
Seems like fairly normal human behaviour.
---
Love it, please do a Redridge mountains as well, that zone is special to me:)
---
Also if I want in the midst of moving right in the middle of Christmas(money is thight) I would be getting one asap, first buy in January though.
---
Or balanced at all?
---
It is the same as a specific patch from wow classic. Tip: avoid pvp. You might become a cry-boii
---
Why would you loosen your gear for the enemy? Seems a good way to lose.
---
I need to try this. It sounds totally unintentional and bugged but could be really effective, lol.
---
60 Druid here, off tank for raids and tank dungeons all the time. 
---
It depends on what your raid needs honestly. If you are still progressing current content then HotW/NS spec is the way to go, as more healers are generally needed for progression. You will need a second set of gear.
---
If you are already on farm, then congrats, you can go full feral. Only talents you need to make sure to pick up from the other trees are 5/5 furor from resto and Natural Weapons from balance. Omen of clarity from balance is also really good. This spec is a massive advantage over Hotw/NS for a feral as you will get leader of the pack. This spec is garbage for PvP though, as you will miss both Natures Swiftness and Insect Swarm. 
---
Bear tanks in pre-bis or better are second to none at this phase, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise! Check out Skarm for detailed descriptions of which phases and bosses feral tank is optimal for.
---
Feral DPS has a bad rep in classic, however with a little tryharding it is actually really good. With wolfshead helm (must have for feral dps) and furor, you can powershift. Optimal powershifting alone will get your damage more than competitive, however it has a higher skill ceiling than most classes. Also you cannot use your bleeds on raid bosses due to the debuff limit. 
---
If you really want to tryhard, you can farm Manual Crowd Pummelers. These combined with optimal powershifting will put your damage in the top 5 in every raid, however it is a lot of work. 
---
Finally, the druid is just a true hybrid and a ton of fun to level if you enjoy that. My shapeshifting, battle rez and innervate has led to some epic moments in dungeons.
---
Druids can really do it all. 
---
* You can tank as well as a warrior 
---
* You can single target heal pretty good, and your HoTs are the best
---
* With tryharding your single target dps is second only to fury warriors and rogues, and you buff other melee classes in addition
---
* You can AoE heal, though not as well as a shaman
---
* You can AoE damage, though not as good as a mage or lock
---
* You can sneak around, though not as good as a rogue
---
* You can ress, though in dungeons not as good as priests, shamans or paladins
---
* You can do caster dps, though not nearly as good as anyone else. Do not recommend
---
* One of the strongest 1v1 and 1v2 PvP classes in the game with the right spec. Massive skill cap though. Best flag carrier in WSG by a mile. 
---
* While leveling, you get 130% movespeed at lvl 20 and 140% at 30, do not underestimate this.
---
Lol what a claim
---
More like "welcome to modern socialist philosophy"
---
Lol ask Don da Jeweler...he’ll tell ya.
---
And forget the chat!
---
Yeah, the Undead are mostly straight up evil in Classic lmao. There's not really much grey there on some of the more WTF quests.
---
Na I am A PVPer lol thanks tho
---
Can someone come in AFTER the domo fight is over (as in was not in the raid or in the instance before) to loot the box? has this been verified?
---
They will when everyone leaves the server because of it.
---
I thought of myself more of being a rare mob regarding the sheer amount of horde jumping me. I feel kind of special.
---
No aimed multi against the mind fray? He should have destroyed you
---
ur funny, it shows that you don’t actually play the game...
---
True but I’m betting on many more people actively trying to get to rank 14 for the weapons. Because BIS&gt;life
---
That dude must have a super small penis.
---
You have a very twisted view of things if you think that anything the Forsaken went through justifies the unknowable amount of people they tortured, experimented on and murdered.
---
The night elves are not perfect but at least they strive for peace where as the Forsaken have only ever gotten more destructive. Then the leader of the Forsaken burned down a tree that was home to tens of thousands of night elf Men, Women and Children. That is nothing short of genocide and is only the tip of the ice burg in terms of the atrocities they have committed.
---
[Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18638/hyper-radiant-flame-reflector)
---
Yeah you're just rewarding the horde players at thag point
---
This is stupid logic. Playing within the rules of the game includes things like pulling the entire instance at once, rolling need on every single drop, etc. Yet those activities will get you blacklisted on any server and result in your getting a poor reputation. Are you saying that Blizzard is entirely to blame since you're playing within the rules? lol, wake up.
---
DINGO BABIES
---
Blowing a sapper for solo kill is incredibly inefficient though. Just put it into perspective, even at 200 honor per kill, to get 100k honor you'd need 500 sappers, which is ~1k gold.
---
Fair enough. That’s interesting. I wonder if it has to do with all the Horde players familiar with Mankrik’s wife memes from the Barrens.
---
We have raids of Horde on our server, peak time (Skeram)
---
When wow Launched it was marketed as the "less hardcore mmo" and one of the major reasons was it had no real death penalties like every other mmo at the time. Just a little durability loss. 
---
It makes little sense in a lore perspective but it was a design choice to not penalize players to much, when they die.
---
Cross realm, no worries
---
After the Lich King's defeat, she allies herself with the remainder of his val'kyr, Valkyrie inspired undead spirits. They have the power to raise the dead, so she uses them to increase the ranks of the Forsaken. She supposedly allows the dead she raises to choose whether they want to join her, but not a lot of players buy that.
---
The Forsaken eventually perfects their plague which they call the Forsaken Blight. The Horde as a whole band the use of it, but Sylvanas orders it used whenever she thinks she can get away with it. When she later becomes warchief, she uses it all the time.
---
Also after becoming warchief, she has the Horde march on Teldrassil. The original plan was to occupy Darnassus. Instead, she chose to burn it down when she knew only innocent noncombatants were left there. 
---
Even later, it's revealed that she did all this + helped set an Old God free all so millions of people would die. She made a deal with some kind of death god and has been funneling souls to him.
---
There's more, but those are the big ones.
---
I picked undead because orcs are too shredded to be a rogue and trolls can't wear shoes. Honestly I wish they could, idk but it just annoys me somehow.
---
Nice backpedal with "trying something to fix the game." You know that freezing cross-realm does nothing to change the faction imbalance and would be far overshadowed by the effects of lenient transfers and/or faction-restricted transfers. That's a pretty disingenuous claim. 
---
   
---
I honestly don't post nearly as much as you do in this subreddit, so it paints a clear picture of who is honestly a little too invested in the game. That's some nice cheap rhetoric though, always hard to find so good on you for holding onto it. 
---
Either way, you want to punish people because you're salty, possibly people that haven't even gotten an HK because they see world pvp in context of the honor system for the mind-numbing griefing that it is (as designed and *incentivized* by Blizzard, not the players, if you remember).
---
Click target the non-elites. They're usually larger and easy to recognize.
---
How is poor population balance blizzards fault? They built the sandbox, we populate it
---
#NOCHANGES
---
^/s
---
Wtf are you on about I would literally give my life to have Tauren in the alliance. Tauren are horde because Thrall and Cairne are buddies.
---
Trinket + wotf can be both used togethrr iirc, its been a while since classic. I dont even think they share a temporary cooldown either think that was all added later.(assuming im correct) wotf is basicall 2nd trinket if youre up againstfear. Theres also a slight shadow resistance which is nice.
---
25 stun resist is nothing to laugh at, also 25% attack power is pretty decent combined with a burst.
---
Basically do you wanna counter fear classes or rogues/pally/warrior stuns.
---
At this point I just pity these type of people. They're like the IASIP gang in the "Charlie rules the world" episode.
---
That was a change in Wrath. If it's going to be #nochanges than Flamelash horde just fucked themselves out of a content tier. 
---
Can't say i feel bad for them
---
Epic mount. It helps you make that next thousand for your lion heart helm more quickly.
---
You think avoiding 1 in 4 stuns isn't op?
---
Like Alliance on Flamelash.
---
Mission accomplished, Horde!
---
Troll rogues in T1,2 and 3 sets looks badass af.
---
Can someone catch me up? I have no idea how this happened. Did the server go from over-populated to no-one or was there a low pop so blizz let people leave for 1 day only and now some people are stuck?
---
Wow just wow. This comment is going to go largely unnoticed but I see you
---
I personally love all the danger in the world.
---
Initially I wanted to play Horde, but my friends convinced me to play Alliance together then miserably quit after 1 month and a half of gameplay. Even though I like the zones of the Alliance, I want to see how Horde side looks. You know what they say, the grass is always greener on the other side. I really love Sylvanas, as a character and her lore, also the blood elf race, can’t wait for TBC to be released. Who knows, maybe they will add Race Changes with the addition of TBC (if confirmed). It will also be easier for me to start a new character given that I will have a guild to back me up instead of playing on Alliance then moving to Horde without knowing anyone. 
---
I'd suggest you to grow up kid :) It's about what you are  enjoying playing. No one vowed any promise to serve Alliance or Horde blindly for the end of their lives. In the last expansions they've put aside their differences to deal with common enemies before.
---
"We must band together united for Dalaran."
---
Man they really shouldn't have increased the server population cap. Too many people on ganking everything.
---
Hillsbrad has actually been filled with pvpers since honor came out so no, much worse than a pve server.
---
Epic mount on pvp server
---
actually could work. get some multiboxer friend with like 10x lv10 alts and queue for warsong.
---
considering you need to spent 12hours+ per day for 12 weeks for rank14, having some multiboxer spending 12hours per week to get 15 hk's on 300 chars does not seem 2 bad. Its a bit more complicated, but there is probably a way to get GM for 1/6 of the time.
---
May have several thousand elemental earth in bank alts, ya. (Oh, and a pair of Undeath-&gt; Water transmutes that print 600g/month.)
---
A bit late but exactly. Personally? Idk care about dkp or if I'm the one incurring it. I'll kill all horse civilians to keep people from quest turn ins because you know what? The game let's me. And fuck anyone else who denied me the same. My warlock will fear your ass. Except my sub expired and life got busy but it's a fucking game. If you wanna grief go grief but don't act like the GMs owe you jack shit. 
---
1. Go pvp
---
2. Have fun
---
It would do the opposite, alliance from those realms would pay for their freedom.
---
is that based off of actual accounts?  or just "characters"  who participate in the honor grind?
---
that's my whole question.
---
most people would say it should go to tanks before dps.
---
Kinda funny skit beaten to death
---
This is the heart of classic - the world.  Forget the wpvp problems - they will go away. The world is forever.
---
Why on earth would you be wearing 8pc might!?
---
Yes, when everyone is asking "why is classic dead?" it's because of the horde.  I don't care that the mechanics "incentivize" it, you made a choice to act like a dick and spread out around flight paths corpse camping people simply on their way to a dungeon.  It doesn't matter that they signed up for a "PvP server", nobody consented to this unmatched shit-show. You're acting like a dick, and you're killing the game, and you know it.
---
Kinda does, but care to explain? 
---
Hunger, desire for more things, desire for the easy route to the acquisition of my objectives incentivized stealing. As long as there are no dis-incentives around(security/police) then there is nothing that says I should not steal. 
---
Yep, I choose not to do so, despite all of those incentives. Other people choose to do so.
---
Wouldnt it be possible if every person make 9 alts that they get 15 kills on every week to artificially create a larger pool of players? Then they could take turns with r14. But that would take quite abit of work/effort to do ^^
---
You can't expect a small indie company to spend all their money on better servers. /s
---
&gt;Ofc unless your healers are super doodoo :p
---
That's the point though. I like having the ability to run UBRS at 3am and still be able to have zero wipes when a shadow priest is healing because that's all that was available. Collecting 8/8 might pieces cost me nothing and I didn't miss out on other pieces because of it, so why not? You can still be at 6% hit with 8/8 might pieces. Is it good for tanking 24/7? Obvious not. No one is going to argue with that. I like having the utility of not needing much heals when I'm having an offspec healer.
---
Aw. I haven't been that way for ages, is it possible to skip everything from there to Hydrospawn? Maybe with an invis pot?
---
I normally do but when I saw him backpeddle in the start I knew what kind of fight it was gonna be :P I wanted to get a quick burst and throw him off while I could.
---
Lazy writing
---
It actually holds up perfectly. Both are actions that strictly speaking benefit you, where your only real disincentive is the potential ethical ramifications. You have the freedom and the incentive to be one, it's your choice whether you will be.
---
Of course it shows the alliance fp. Cry about it some more
---
Sort of, but not really. Like if youre getting stunned multiple times in quick succession, youre going to be immune anyway because of DRs, or just flat out dead you know? Like only time its super super good is if it makes you immune to a 5cp ks but thats rare and the likelihood of you resisting multiple stuns in succession is extremely low if not impossible as ive never experienced it.  
---
Honestly I think that the best race for rogue is either gnome or dwarf and thats you deciding who do you **really** want to say fuck you to. Like warrior is easily rogue's worst matchup but if youre a dorf you can just get rid of rend and vanish to reset, where every other rogue has to just eat it and hope they can live. Their second worst matchup has to be mage by far, because of the snare, but escape artist levels the field by a huge margin.  
---
Like wotf sounds amazing... but its not, imo. Mainly because 2/3 of the classes that can fear, are cloth wearers and because theyre cloth wearers, you can just blow them up. You can make an argument then that Orc is the way to go and I wouldnt disagree with you, im just saying that the stun resist is good but seemingly always procs when you dont care for it to. Could just be anecodtal bias though.
---
If you’re dosing you sit in berserker unless you utilize an overpower proc. Never cast tens. Use bloodthirst and whirlwind off cd.
---
People grinding honor can do it way faster in a bg
---
My recommendation - warlock. I can't speak for pvp, but they're a blast to level, usually in high demand for utility alone, will scale to very respectable dps, and can get by with very few consumables (life tap instead of runes, for example). 
---
Their main downside is restocking on soul shards, but tbh I never found it that much of a hassle
---
Like so I won’t get ganked and stuff right?
---
It would make for an excellent case study focusing on antisocial gaming behaviour and internet use. I find what's occurring on unbalanced servers extremely interesting.
---
Yep, works consistently.
---
Hoo laddy
---
It was 32:68 over last 7 days
---
Trust me. Nothing makes the alliance angrier than orc stun bullshittery. I personally watched an orc blessed by god resist three back to back stuns from a rogue and pala trying to kill him.
---
Before you go deeper into arguing numbers, read his comments again. He isn't arguing populations, he is arguing horde having a toxic culture in contrast to some alliance chivalry based on a mass of hyperboles where he's using the population census as just one thing to support that argument. Even though he's clearly wrong claiming things like "all PvP servers are horde dominated", it's not even the meat of his attempt at amateur psychology. His entire point is hOrdE bAd aLliAncE gOoD.

The reason they are losing has nothing to do with racials, or even who is winning individual fights.  It's just the massive overpopulation of horde.
---
As alliance I blame blizzard more than I do Horde
---
But now imagine fishing in the canals of Stormwind instead of the slums of Ogrimmar.  That option is available to you now
---
Ctrl +s
---
That's funny. I remember before launch anyone who said they wanted to roll PvE or mentioned others might want to roll PvE got shouted down because "PvP is the real experience."
---
This subreddit masturbated over the idea of World PvP for months on end.
---
&gt; Sylvanas is evil, not the forsaken as a whole.
---
+ The forsaken guy serving the argents at LHC. idr his name.
---
No lock trainer in TB tho
---
My favorite BG has always been Arathi Basin, but can be frustrating if your team doesn't coordinate well.  
---
WSG was great for random grouping, and honestly I spent more time just killing people than worrying about the flag (it took care of itself if you just killed enough people).  
---
AV was pretty boring.  Very much like raid on raid world PvP.  Only went there on the honor bonus weekends back in the day for massive honor gains.
---
Try ctrl + s
---
And there you go, you've answered your own question! Wrath 2pc &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; might 8pc. The Stam alone on wrath helm is crazy.
---
Events like these leave scars that are very difficult to heal over on a community level.  People who left already due to not being able to play anyway have already turned their attention elsewhere.
---
 [https://youtu.be/jiKSnWgOIAs](https://youtu.be/jiKSnWgOIAs)  VIDEO IS STILL UPLOADING THIS WILL BE THE LINK
---
I'am sure this person is trying to give thier SO a shout out but damn is this a bad way to say thank you, assuming they even read wowclassic reddit to see the the thank you. The author should cough up what they're doing in return to make up for the extra work, maybe then they will get some up votes. 
---
I got a toddler and a wife and guess what? I don't raid because of that, i play dungeons while they're both sleeping.
---
Vanilla wow only allowed you to bg within your server. They could choose to do that if they wanted
---
I think the sheer size of the Battlegroup's pools will negate this a little bit. At least, I hope it does.
---
Whatever combo that gives you Scatter Shot and Intimidation imo. While using a boar pet. I’ve never played hunter myself tho
---
Yea, thats not how things work in the real life.
---
On the other side, if you (Blizzard) know something will end in a catastrophe you should do something.
---
But Blizzard refused to do something and now they were offering free tansfers to safe the sub-money.
---
I'm with you - weather those downvotes.  If I were horde, I'd claim victory and reroll somewhere else.
---
It’s legit at most 5 minutes to clear added onto your first run and then normal from then on. Absolutely worth it to me to just clear it and prevent that 30 minute death march in.
---
Cry, cry, cry. Welcome to classic bitch! No server transfers! Just gonna have to do what we did, and reroll.
---
Suck it up buttercup.
---
faerlina where its at
---
Blessing of Freedom is a god send for flag runners.
---
that counterweight tho
---
I think u want a Scatter Shot + Intimidation spec paired with a boar pet
---
No it didn't. People who are easily influenced decided that was the way to go.
---
Ya math is funny like that. Sometimes a big number actually doesn't make much of a difference.
---
You're not real if you dont Tauren rogue
---
Multiple PVP servers are experiencing so much faction imbalance (all in Horde favor, as far as I know) that playing Alliance is becoming more frustration than it's worth. I recently created a toon on Skeram and Ironforge is under constant attack. The AH is just about bone dry, because people aren't active and can't farm. Multiple YouTubers/Streamers (for example Asmongold and MetaGoblin) have videos of it.  
---
Quest and die. Get off flight path and die. Stay in IF and die. If you're Alliance, you die.
---
Ascension private server did this and it was amazingly fun, I think you could pick 3 items to not lose but it cost gold.
---
Same. Had a busy day at work and went to bed early so didn't play on the 5th. My entire guild is gone now and I am stuck on this server...my sub runs out on the 23th and I already canceled and told blizzard the reason not that it would change anything...
---
I guess you still have to die so you appear at the correct entrance after the first run, unless you decide to exit through the tunnel (which I wouldn't risk as dying there forces you to spirit rez).
---
Queues too long for Horde, basically.
---
Was a dorf my man, meant that I had many good interactions with hordies during my time.
---
No they are not viable. Roll something else.
---
The basic fury rotation is Bloodthirst on cd and WW as #2 priority, swapping for overpower on dodges if both are on cd and you won't dump too much rage.
---
My advice is to tank yourself - put a shield on and collect some good tank hear (avoid leather and the like). It will make it much easier to find groups, and there is no need to respec.
---
The core non-prot tank rotation is shield block + revenge (shield block enables revenge, you highest threat ability) and sunder spam at all other times. You'll have to be swapping targets constantly on most pulls, but once you get the hang of it it can be very fun.
---
If you haven't run an instance youre tanking before let the group know and ask someone else to mark / guide you, most groups dont have a problem with that.
---
So it’s either:
---
A) Cry about being farmed/Cry about no more people to fight 
---
B) Act superior to players because they chose a mode they wanted. 
---
Man you PvP players are so conflicted.
---
We are replying to a guy asking for advice.  Maybe you are the one who needs to "leave others to do them."
---
It's a shame so many of you rolled pvp, lots of us wish you were with us on pve servers, still having a great time over here.
---
Nice job attacking a minute detail of my post and ignoring everything else, because your comment was so stupid you literally cannot defend it in any other way
---
bruh salzwasserschnappkiefer
---
Alliance Propaganda and fake news. We are just sharing our gift of eternal life with the world and how simple world peace would be resolved if you all voluntarily join the Forsaken. Dark lady watch over us.
---
U forgot gouge
---
Griefing is part of every online game, developers decide how much is allowed.
---
Players are fucking *scum*, these guys would permanently delete your character if the game allowed them to.  There needs to be rules and game mechanics that prevent this as players can't police each other.
---
Lolwut, there is nobody there. Ever. People dont even quest there, cause theres only like 5 quests. 
---
Gromsblood was the only reason I'd ever go there, but the market tanked on gromsblood. Its not worth the time
---
uhhh yeah, i want the equivalent for my mage's frost shield, thats awesome
---
Yes, it is convenient for me.
---
That was almost your entire post, shit for brains.
---
\&gt;plays world of warcraft to fight baby-tier AI
---
stunning.
---
brave.
---
should have rolled on a balanced PVP server.  best of both worlds.  sorry about your loss.
---
We need more Flamelash posts. 3 daily posts are not enough.
---
Thats only if you have daggers and are using SS.
---
Windows volume mixer?
---
You've tried it, though? Or are you just assuming. I, too assume it's not great but I'm curious if anyone's actually given it a go.
---
So? Following your analogy the alliance blacklisted the entire horde, doesnt want to play with them anymore and left the server to play with other horde-people.
---
The difference is: Farming alliance wont get you blacklisted in your own faction. It has zero consequences for you to gank 24/7. So people will do it. And do you want to blame them? Should horde not kill any alliance for 4 weeks, because Blizzard implemented a sh\*ty system?
---
Its usually not that, its that this item is unimpressive on single target.
---
Yes it is very good if you are tanking a lot... but its not completely uncommon for tanks to spend a lot of timing tanking 1 target.
---
Probably going to make things easier for the top grinders.  With pvp being so convenient the number of players with 15HKs each week is going to go way up, making the top brackets larger.
---
Wowhead guides are kind of bad
---
Even bis lists like https://www.wowclassicbis.com/ are very lacking, at least for certain classes spec ( prot warrior has like 0% hit rating on suggested items )
---
So if you raid Sunday night MC, can you raid Friday night MC again?  Then I understand I would have to wait untill the Next Friday to raid MC again because of the reset on Tuesday?
---
That was an example (among many) of something they can do instead of ganking FPs all day, among with the rationale why the reduced honor rate isn't that vital anyway.
---
But I don't know why I expected any better from the genius level intellect that gave us "players can either not PvP at all or gank every FP ever and force the minority faction to quit, literally no other things they can do"
---
Everything you said is true, except it's alliance doing it on our server.
---
Not big on the wow lore, but I never trust elfs as a rule of thumb, especially not high legs, arrogant pricks... 
---
But it's funny, never thought about what the alliance counter to UD rogues was, now I know, cheeky sneaky gnomes
---
But the robes look fabulous along my human skull necklace.
---
A few key things:  
---
1. Evocation is subject to pushback when you take damage while using it.  In this case, it will lower the duration of the channel, and you'll get less mana back.  Make sure you're using it at an opportune time.  
---
2. Your passive mana regen is dictated by the five second rule: that means that once you cast a spell, your mana regeneration is suspended for 5 seconds.  You gain exemptions to this from Mage Armor and the Arcane Meditation talent that lets you regen a percentage of that amount the entire time, which does add up.   Swap to Mage Armor if you haven't already if having mana issues. 
---
3.  Don't underestimate talents that reduce spell costs.  
---
4.  Don't underestimate Intellect.  You get 15 mana for every point you have, so the more you have the more you can cast.
---
It's stated perfectly clear in that duskwood questline where the player character has to forge a potion to kill an imprisoned alliance spy that was about to warn the horde of a conspiracy against both factions.
---
botes are customers too \~\~\~\~
---
Blizz man bad 😡

I always port to tb to bank/ah.

Dont really like uc and the lag in orgrimmar is unbearable. All actions in org are delayed during prime hours ever since they removed layers on my server.

Hope you Horde enjoy your login queues just to queue up for a BG LOL... this is gonna backfire so hard...
---
Leveling in peace and doing pvp on my own terms sounds amazing.
---
I'm horde but I'm not a baddie. I play on a PvE server like the other 10% of intellectuals on this sub reddit
---
Horde always dominates PVP, was like that as well back in the day.
---
I play horde on Heartseeker and the alliance ganking horde is horrendous but what are you gonna do :)
---
It is really simple, actually
---
1. too many horde for alliance to stand a chance
---
2. at a point, literally no alliance are looking for fights, because they are too outnumbered and stand no chance
---
3. Now you have to take the fight to people who dont want to fight (aka ganking) or not fight at all
---
But yes, they should have played gank police to kill off the 0 alliance instead, because that isnt fucking idiotic. Or gone and fought the 0 alliance who were looking to actively pvp literally anywhere. 
---
You are too stupid for me to respond to anything else. Read this shot slowly or have someone read it to you if you need help.

Id rather have those people go seek counseling because something is honestly terribly wrong with their life if they are willing to play a video game for 12+ hours everyday for months at a time

I like 0/21/30. It maximizes my tools for cc with improved conc, scatter shot, extended trap duration and imp wing clip. I can also still do competitive damage on raid nights.
---
TOO BAD TO DORE EN TAI

Next you gonna tell me MC isn't a good PVE endgame for 6 months???
---
Glad you liked my EQ guides! I updated them within the last two years quite a bit, dunno if you used them before that or after i did the updates
---
I probably would have played something else if they weren't.  Wow wouldn't exist if it weren't for the popularity of wc3 and undead are a big part of that.
---
Casual lvl 44 fury warrior here. Couple questions: 
---
What's the best way to get and maintain aggro on multiple enemies when tanking in a dungeon? Usually I do charge into thundering clap, then switch to defensive stance where I can use revenge and taunt if needed. Sometimes I try rotating sunder armour between the mobs. For instance does it help spamming demo/battle shout more than once? Is deathwish something I should use? And what should I do if mobs start running all over the place and challenging shout is on cooldown?
---
Also I generally use a shield, unless the trash mobs are green and there's low risk of dying, which I might stick to dual wielding for better dps. Are the abilities requiring a shield still worth having, or is the extra damage and rage a better choice in these situations?
---
I was laughing the whole time, because I death coil crit him.
---
this is the reason this subreddit is trash. grow up
---
No. If you have time gouge is sick. Cheap hemo gouge wait for energy, kidney hemo hemo hemo
---
Orcs drank demons blood and committed genocide on multiple worlds.
---
I'd say they are a bit worse than the undead.
---
31/5/15 is legit. You trade Piercing Howl and Enrage for Last Stand and Iron Will. You can also off-tank in raids without changing talents (since you have room to take 1 point in Improved Shield Block). 
---
Improved Revenge shouldn't factor into your decision though.
---
You don't get honor from the same player indefinitely.
---
You can only have one faction on pvp servers. They cannot make alliance alts.
---
The usage of the word 'apparently' implies that the source was from someone inside blizzard that knows what is happening. But since nothing official has come out it isn't set in stone.
---
A speculation is just a wild guess from random people that have no influence or idea of the inner workings of blizzard.
---
The part where it's on a 2nd account is implied there. Technically you only need 1 extra account, you just feed them everything through neutral AH.
---
I’ve been having fun.  Getting randomly ganked on my alt in STV while I’m half hp from a mob and  then tracking the guy down while he’s juggling mobs.  How else would I get to *be* karma?
---
I have regrets
---
Kurinaxx alliance is great.  It’s only a little in horde favor. About as healthy and large of a pvp server you can find
---
Yes.  You can raid Monday night and Tuesday morning even, just not again until it resets the next Tuesday.
---
That list is completely upside-down for me.  Wow.
---
bruv, using a keyboard is for losers. get on my level
---
Introspection is something a depressingly large portion of humanity never seem to develop.

In my own life experience, it took a truly traumatizing period of life to really dig into my own psyche objectively, and learn the value of metacognition.

Many, perhaps most, will grow old and die before looking within themselves as clearly as they believe they look externally.

Stay flagged up on a PvE server.
---
Everyone becomes rogues, that you can't get the first hit on.
---
Enjoy your carebear experience where you have a chance at getting the first hit.

It's worse than a pve server. Because pve servers have pvp going on.

You can buy gear based on your Honor rank. r14s get purple weapons.

And how many players are justifying griefing and in general borderline sociopathic behavior

That is the stupidest plot line of the entire BFA story arc.

where did the bad rogue touch you?
---
So on a 20:80 server 60% of the population (75% of the horde) should just stay in their capital, do nothing, farm nothing and kill nothing?
---
Most ally are crying cuz even on balanced servers, they are getting corpse camped, flight spawn camped, dungeon entrance camped, graveyard camped 24/7 and the wait time prevents you from chain red pawns, so you end up spending a lot of time sitting around in ghost form. 
---
Pretty sure horde are experiencing this to some extent also. . . But they don’t seem to be crying as loud. . . Ashamed of my fellow ally to be honest.
---
Im more worried about your need to jump to conclusions.
---
I love how you are trying to fix a problem that was already fixed 13 years ago. They know its a problem, they already fixed it in Burning Crusade... But if they fixed it again, it wouldnt really be classic now would it?
---
I was healing scholomance to get dark runes, I told my group in advance thats all I was there for and they were fine with it. But when i got there, the hunter was also rollling need on the runes. I asked him if he was selling them. He said no - he uses them in raids. First I thought it was weird he didnt say shit before the dungeon that he was going there for the runes too (he was geared, clearly didn't need anything from scholo) and also I found it weird he actually claimed to use the runes... so hunters, are dark runes useful for you? Or is this guy bullshitting me? Regardless I won all the runes so I didn't get screwed but I doubt he was happy.
---
Very true. It's become far more important nowadays to seek outside validation than internal. It's one of my personal theories as to why people who are around lottery winners go bankrupt as well as the lottery winners lol. Kind of off topic but it was interesting to me
---
Honestly, while the larger server capacities might have hurt PvP realms, it's been a wonderful experience on a PvE server: the world feels alive but not overly farmed, and finding groups is trivial as DPS even at odd hours. In the unlikely case that Blizzard imposes lower maximum capacities on the servers, I'd be super bummed if PvE servers had these same restrictions.
---
Bank alts
---
You should do deep-prot if you don't already know all the answers to those questions.
---
Hey dont call other peoples logic stupid this is a place for discussion. I understand plenty of people are upset about the problem here but its no excuse. The community is what you make it and your words dont represent the kind of player cooperation your claiming you want. IMO the fault does lie with blizzard. They have plenty of  solutions but they treat classic like a welfare check they just collect for free. "you think you do but you dont" bullshit mentality where they dont take responsibility for a game they can clearly afford to fix. Theres many solutions and they do nothing. If everyone focused on blizzard being the real problem something might get them off their ass. Instead forums like this turn on each other, blizz collects a paycheck and the game dissolves into shit.
---
So why not stay and get max honor every cycle and get the pvp gear?
---
Eh.. Maybe. We're definitely the most seemingly evil. We constantly get betrayed though so it's no wonder we're a little sour about it. It's more 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' with the Forsaken being a part of the Horde, than us outright not fitting. 
---
The Alliance certainly weren't having us, though there's solid reasons they could have brought us in at various points. I think we make more sense than Tauren's for Horde though.
---
ty man
---
Gouge should be used prior to kidney if you don't get an initiative proc. This allows you to still get off a 5pt kidney. 
---
One thong to note is that we've lost about .5s on every disable due to how latency + spell batching works. If you wait until the last .1 or .2 seconds to use a chain disable, there's a good chance the enemy can cast an ability due to spell batching. This can mean getting blinded/gouged, death coiled, feared etc. So it's better to not cut it too close; especially vs other rogues who have a good chance to 100-0 you before you are able to control your character again. This applies in the opposite direction, too. Spam that blind if a rogue cheap shots you. At least half the time they will fuck up and think that kidney shotting at .1s means a stun lock. You will probably blind them for the ks duration and get to reopen. Don't make the same mistake and you win. 
---
Of course 1v1 rarely happens for 30+ seconds these days. So good luck.
---
What's a good questing addon (with directions, not just quest indicators aka questie)? I've been using AAP but as soon as I did one quest out of order it decided to skip way ahead, then got completely broken and doesn't show up at all.
---
how many headaches? 1 stack or 100? I have 10
---
Even servers that are slightly tilted its a problem. Its the players actions, not just an imbalance. The lack of self awareness is astonishing in this thread. Players actions have consequences.
---
I just want to say you do a really great job with the fonts too, they add so much to an already superb composition!
---
I understand that ethics is a complex subject but you honestly can't be so slow that you don't understand analogies, right? Even for the average gamer that's just too sad... right?
---
I mean crit (and therefore agi) is still really good for warriors. It’s just that 1% crit is more or less equal to 20 AP so strength is about twice as good measured 1:1. Obviously there is a balance since the more AP you have the more value you get out of crits, and you need a decent baseline of crit to keep flurry profs up, but that’s a good general guideline to follow.
---
That's pretty mad
---
Would be first time in classic. Have earlier tried arms/prot and have considered going deep prot, but I like the flexibility of being able to dps as well. I have spent quite a bit of time researching, and I know hit is good. Problem is quite a few of the good hit items are mail/leather which means I would lose alot of armor and stam. The items with agi/str that are plate usually have quite a bit of stam as well. Mostly just unsure of what «soft» cap of defense I should go for as 440 is not reasonable to go for.
---
Oh, so you understand that being able to choose your interactions with other people is actually quite nice. 
---
Kind of like a PvE server...
---
/highfive
---
We also die during the fight with Argus.
---
Were all parties level 60?
---
It's almost as if no changes was a bad idea.
---
Balnazzar took over the stratholme crusaders after the argent dawn split from the scarlet crusade, Abbendis and Ithuwhatever were already insane and practiced holy light torture on anyone they captured who wasn't a crusader. They were insane from the beginning when the scourge attacked lordaeron.
---
What I’ve noticed is that it’s generally even on faction controlled zones. For example horde will own BRM but alliance will hold LHC. Feels very balanced
---
Haha. Perfection.
---
This is entirely the issue here and I haven't seen it said as well anywhere else.
---
Ah. Yeah I didn't play that far. That was late legion right?

---
No offense but it seems like you don't understand anything. You should really consider doing some research, like actual research. Sit yourself down and read up on the mechanics of your class.
---
There's plenty of good hit items that aren't leather/mail so you're wrong. Lionheart helm, Onyxia's tooth pendant, tarnished elven ring, blackstone ring, brigam girdle, gauntlets of might, battleborn armbraces, band of accuria, blackcrow/satyr's bow, etc.
---
PvE is boring. u dont like the satisfaction of analing destorying the alliance scum?
---
That sounds like East Germany but with extra steps
---
It's amazing how much better life is when you think for yourself and don't let dramatic internet mobs make your decisions for you.
---
Kirtonos?
---
They've already made a bunch of changes.
---
He happened midways through the crusade, after they split into argent dawn and scarlet crusade. The leaders were already insane and torturing living people. That's why the sane crusaders left and took lights hope.
---
Lionheart if raiding is your priority, mount if it's PvP
---
Are they doing it to illustrate the point and drive it home harder proving how much blizz fucked up?
---
Not really sure how that would fix anything. What would be the motivation for leveling a new character on a new realm in the first place? There has to be incentive. Even if it's 3x faster, why would people want to?
---
They can do whatever they want and the people of the #nochanges crowd are fuckin morons with either a flawed memory of Vanilla or never experienced this particular phase of it.
---
Why shouldn't they? Why not make the game better?
---
[deleted]
---
Lol, no the players are part of the issue too.
---
&gt; Is spamming improved hamstring attempting to get the immobilization effect a worthwhile tactic? Do you generate rage from the hamstring damage?
---
Depends, if you have excess rage and are facing a class that can run away from you then yeah, it would be worth it.
---
No, you do not generate rage from yellow damage
---
and what does "bought High Warlord" mean?
---
No, most guilds (including mine) has it as tank prio.
---
It's not even that good for DPS warriors considering how easy it is to get hit capped.
---
I have both del’rend swords and mirahs song. I also have draks deflector shield. I have a few questions. I am prot. When I take do I use shield and mirahs song or one of sacred charge/tribal guardians with shield. I have all BiS optional or BiS best with a couple purple pieces, all with either threat and mitigation. Also when I get a purple weapon (dragon slayer or MC weapons) do I use those two-hands when tanking instead of shield?
---
The second time around I 4-5pt cb evis after cs instead of kidney. I’m not sure if this is incorrect but I have core hound tooth and typically I’m able to crit for 13-1600 on most targets not wearing plate
---
The boomer way.
---
Please go see a doctor...
---
The layout of the city is actually very good, as you can go from AH to bank to anvil in literal straight lines.
---
eve online is over that way ^^
---
Lmao
---
You can use Hemo twice after a Cheap Shot so you either get 4 or 5 points. No way to always get 5 points unless you spam Hemo then Kidney after the Gouge which would break the stunlock.
---
The stats are on par with a lvl 40-42 green outside of FR. That's hardly good. Taking it for those stats and depriving a war/ret/sham of a fuckmassive dps boost is a dick move to say the least.
---
eve online lives on this exact mechanic. pvp is fucking serious business over there.
---
PvE people really out here calling PvP players carebears
---
Imagine thinking you can be emasculated due to a fantasy game.
---
Not with you horde scum.
---
It wouldnt be a very efficient way to farm them but I know the hunters in my guild do use them.  Spending the same hour in Azshara or Felwood he easily could have gotten 5-10.
---
Multiboxing isn’t cheating.
---
Yeah its really good in its element... no way it can be called BIS without including when multitarget tanking.
---
Blows my mind how much money they could make off of server transfers and they aren’t doing it.
---
You need a large enough pool of active players getting minimum of 15hk a week. You'd reach like r8 then be stuck.
---
I want to start as a fresh alliance on a PvE server, with east coast US time zone. What are the  current viable servers? Horde to Alliance ratio isnt my main concern, I just want to be able to have some alliance online with some decent guilds
---
It’s always black and white for me....
---
I checked it out, seems it's just a list of quests? Unlike AAP where you just follow the arrow and click NPCs.
---
ok i suck at math. can u run that down for me please, how exacty 60/40 makes 50% more horde?
---
Honestly, Blizzard is just inconsistent on it. 
---
Sometimes, Forsaken are heartless psychopaths. Sometimes they care about their old lives.
---
Why even discuss this when it isn't going to change. People begged for the rank 14 grind. They now got it, as close to the real deal as it gets and people are crying.
---
I think there is some real internal political turmoil going on at blizzard wrt classic.
---
Idk tho, I'm a dungeon hero, not interested in raiding atm, but it still has a really good proc rate in boss fights. Idk if I'm just lucky or if they messed up the tooltip, but it definitely seems like a better than 2% chance. I dont log or anything like that but I do keep a pretty good eye on buffs n stuff so I can make better threat decisions, n I would say it's up probably 50% of the time in a boss fight. On trash packs it's closer to 90 percent.
---
He was an ironman. How could you?
---
Me too! I've been getting tons of Stephen Fry recommended too which is just great
---
Guano= Poop. The end.
---
I’ve never known anyone to actually use that shield idk
---
But people will disagree, and when they do Thrall makes the decisions.
---
&gt;Do people that do this kind of stuff grew up torturing animals or something?
---
No. They just chose to play on a server made partly for PvP experiences like this.
---
I'm on Bloodsail, it's lovely. Come join the Horde!
---
Someone in the guild already posted that they have like 200 members. The guild replaced zone chat basically.
---
It's the latter. I've been closing all programmes but I'll start disabling all addons and then enabling them one by one
---
been leveling fine lately in STV as an alliance in Stalagg. So far I've died only 5 times and was able to kill 3 hordes too. 
---
level 37 priest - completed atleast 10-13 quests so far in the northern region. 
---
Hopefully tomorrow I will finish most of STV quests relatively peaceful. ZF / Tanaris may be an issue but it's still way fucking safer compared to oh... you know IRON FORGE...... there's more hordes than alliance in IF.
---
While I mostly agree there are a few instances the Alliance out scums the Horde in the story, I'll always remeber the one quest for Alliance where you try to outbid the Horde on some oil, then just steal it because the Horde were willing to pay more.
---
could you post this again? invite expired
---
Or they are ignoring it just like they did 15 years ago. I hope your right, but I feel like I've seen this all before...
---
In Classic, they are 99% evil. There is one undead who gives heroic quests, and he is in the Argent Dawn. The rest are either neutral or evil.
---
It wasn't until later that we got the semi-retcon that there are plenty of good Forsaken too.
---
&gt; not being able to participate in half of the game
---
Not sure how you all seem to forget we can still pvp. When we so choose.
---
Drums. Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. They. Are. Coming.
---
Did you vanish?  If you vanish it drops you from the kill table for players.  It however may not drop you from other aggro lists, such as guards and random NPCs, who will happily chase you down through stealth...
---
&gt;they went the lazy route
---
No. They want that route because literally everybody and their mother asked for that. The most vocal people begged for this and a majority of all people making their voice heard through forums and what not, seemed to want it as well.
---
i never defend, it's all offence 24/7, I lull them in to a false sense of security, then skadunk them with the force of 100,000 raging ducks
---
Haha that's interesting. I have also not forgotten how racist and messed up the humans were in WCIII
---
agreed... 50% value drops its worth considerably and most importantly it has a high chance of not helping with initial threat. Which is huge on single target.
---
This kid just punked himself lewl
---
OPs question is more how will the battlegroups be setup
---
2 is already pretty extreme. You don’t need to use it on everything anyways- swap to drillborer or draconian when you don’t need the effect. 
---
Also repair bot is like 15g tops? And mats for shield are maybe 6-700 on my server? You can repair a lot of times before long term cost hits you on the 3rd.
---
I moved to Pagle and I love it
---
I know right, it's current year bro.
---
Can you make a new post in a different pose? It's hard to make out which carebear symbol you have on your stomach with that hand in the way... Thanks!
---
How about you tell me why that is a strawmen? How about you tell me what 60% of the server population should do, if there is a 20:80 ratio? What should they do? Because I am playing on a rather balanced server and the underpopulated faction is also farming FPs and blocking instances.
---
How about you tell me how to farm honor if you have 4 times more people than the other side without farming the other side? Do you just let them kill you when you are on your farming route? Especially with a honor system where one single person can mess up everything.
---
The only consequence for horde is they have less allies to farm. But so has every other horde. So it is not a consequence at all. Allies transfering to nother realm is not a consequence for the horde. Even better: They dont have to compete with alliance for resources. And in 4 days they can farm honor in BGs. So tell me, where are the consequences? Better now: Allies that transfered will still play the game, so less queue-time for horde over all. So they even benefit from transfering allies.
---
I’m kinda a noob when it comes to stat priority and those kinda things as I played classic when I was younger but didn’t really know what I was doing/ wasn’t trying to min/max. Also how do you find out your hit %? How do I figure out what stats I should be prioritizing sorry if this is v nooby I feel so behind compared to others as to most these things seem to be common knowledge.
---
We need a new flair for “HERP DERP”
---
I mean blizz shutdown the largest bot by far. Hardly a failure
---
That is not all it does though. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4fdGxy8.png)
---
QQ
---
Butthurt alert
---
Yeah. 100% not needed though when you factor in actual gear adding to the Holy Shock, and other attacks in a typical fight. God forbid if you just start stacking more and more on use items like the 36 Warrior.
---
Cheers, but I see that Thrash Blade MH (ESS)/Flurry Axe OH (DSS) is better than the other options. Would there be any odd interactions between Thrash Blade and Flurry Axe?
---
He thought he did, but he didn't.
---
&gt;*You don’t enjoy the sudden attention and fixation all of a sudden?*
---
How's work at the Department of Redundancy Department?
---
right right
---
Sure but the undead weren't part of the big three factions that allied to take down Archimonde, and players aren't even playing Arthas allied undead. People didn't get to play Blood Elves until the expansion released, and once again the race was given as sorry ass excuse as to why they are Horde allied.
---
It goes well some days. Well other days.
---
and you'd need even less hit cause of edge but hardly anymore. im not sure edgemastesr are worth it if you are orc
---
true lmaoo
---
Transfers closed today lol
---
People in here really getting snarky about server types. Keep it up reddit.
---
[This is more accurate tbh](https://media.giphy.com/media/VhnX7VJPgKODRYhWsf/giphy.gif)
---
No, even then they play for 12 hours a day. The premade pacts prevent it from going to 16+ hours a day
---
Not even one whole shield is used up in an MC run. 
---
Now something like a stray live run, I get to the doors of the castle and it’s depleted. It all depends on the amount of mobs; something MC doesn’t have many of.
---
You need to fucking chill out lol.  Go play another game dude.
---
I can confirm, I have not even been raid logging for the last 2 weeks. If BGs do not drastically reduce the world ganking, the game is dead to me.
---
I see this a lot and this is such a bad take. Why would Blizzard want its profitable game to fail? Because one guy said "you think you do..." and has since apologized/retracted?
---
That statement was made when they were trying to avoid putting dev time/other resources into Classic, now that they have invested resources, including advertisement, they aren't going to intentionally sink their 'highest new subscribers in a single quarter' game out of spite. That makes no sense.
---
The more obvious explanation is that Blizzard doesn't have a good solution for faction imbalance, which is consistent with how they have acted in the past.
---
Go orc for the 90% stun resist obv
---
Paladin are better than shamans for group PvP.
---
The real inequality is just that Horde are better solo and Alliance are better in group content and people don't care as much about group content.
---
&gt;*You PvP server players are the crayon eating middle schoolers to us.*
---
Come back and talk when you can start a sentence without "bruh"...
---
True, but I still think its gonna be better than a dps trinket. Just my opinion it procs often enough during a fight and with different consumables that I never have to worry about dps throttling themselves that theres no point in farming an instance that I hate for a dps trinket. Now if there was one that gave me better aoe threat I would farm the shit out of it lol
---
Blizzard fumbles this pretty badly in places.
---
There's multiple quests in classic that require you to be dead. The paladin quest to learn your rez involves you using an item to resurrect an NPC.
---
There's a whole joke line in Cataclysm about Azuregos falling in love with a spirit healer.
---
In WotLK, there's a couple of quest chains that have you resurrect NPCs.
---
For one of them you literally collect his dismembered body parts that have been used in several different abominations, sew them together yourself, and somehow resurrect him.
---
But... in the very same zone there's a quest chain to attempt to cure a paladin of the scourge plague, even though canonically paladins are immune to it. And you FAIL to do this, and he dies because it's an ever so poignant reference by the developers to someone who died of cancer.
---
Let's not forget all the raid bosses where death and resurrection are part of the fight mechanics.
---
It's not just gameplay and story segregation. Resurrection is legitimately a thing in the lore.
---
Abbendis has a journal that laments getting killed and resurrected many times, and when you kill her in Northrend, a big deal is made about taking her head to prevent another resurrection.
---
Nefarian and Onyxia were resurrected.
---
You, the player, resurrect Bloodlord Mandokir with only his skull and another troll's body.
---
Lei Shen was resurrected.
---
But all that goes out the window when they need an emotional punch. Anduin Wrynn is a priest who has demonstrated the use of many skills available to the player. 
---
Except Resurrection. 
---
Because plot.
---
Nevermind that a nobody tauren NPC gets a rez after getting EATEN by magnataur in Northrend.
---
Just like time travel, when you incorporate resurrection into the actual plot it adds nothing but copious amounts of both Herp and Derp.
---
At least in scholo so much stuff drops you can make a good amount of money just vendoring boss items. Then get dark runes on top of that. Thats what I do typically. The runes have gotten kind of pricey too anyways.
---
8 out of 10 Cats does Countdown is a spinoff panel show. If you like WILTY you will like 8Oo10C.
---
&gt;Why shouldn't they? Why not make the game better?
---
I can't really answer the question because your question is wrong. The answer to the first question is the inverse of your second. They shouldn't mess with server balance because it's going to make the game worse.
---
It's not #nochanges though. The high server cap is one of the biggest changes blizzard can and has implemented.
---
Every time I go there on my server everythings dead and there 3-5 groups ganking lowbies to maintain their grindspot.
---
&gt;  in coordinated pvp. 
---
Thats the problem. People care a lot more about solo PvP than group play.
---
Is it just me or is this basically justice? Hope they enjoyed all that toxic griefing because now they have a dead server and nobody to gank.
---
Fuckin' bizarro...
---
With the comment of mine directly above this...
---
Congratulations, you played yourself. 
---
Bruh.
---
This is just a typical night on Fairbanks.
---
An orc with a sword*
---
*Live to win!*
---
60 run in and have seen HoJ 3 times and SGC once. You got off lucky imo.
---
How do you kill last boss as priest mage?
---
That was half the crowd and the other half was calling everyone filthy casuals and telling them to re-roll on a PvE server
---
I know man me too haha. I'm not complaining. But hell I'm even seeing them in my Facebook feed lately haha.
---
English please.
---
*punches the air*
---
Be honest, the only reason most of us know this is Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls. Amirite?
---
Shikaka!
---
I would like to know what AP is, I think agi points but idk lollll
---
Per first sentence “Title kind of speaks for itself but I can’t find any info on the internet if blizz is implementing battle groups...”
---
So I provided a link that confirms the first question
---
Flamelash is the first unofficial single faction server. The few remaining alliance guilds started leaving two days before their transfers were shut down.
---
Or roll on a pve server maybe...?
---
Kinda like paladins and that one spell that they could stack infinite crits to one shot world bosses?
---
Or because it’s hilarious
---
There are a lot of itemization gaps left with Naxx gear. You could have another raid to fill those and people would do it.
---
It's a bad analogy that comes from your frustrations. 
---
If this is a good analogy to you it's really sad and you should step away from video games for a while
---
I have no problem admitting that this is exactly what I thought about when reading the name. 
---
That, and a grown man being birthed out of a robotic rhino's sphincter.
---
&gt;  Paladins in PvP don’t bring as much as Shamans. 
---
Paladins are the strongest group PvP class by far. Blessing of Freedom, Bubble, Blessing of Protection, defensive cleanse and good heals.
---
They don't get the big crits though, so not very popular.
---
dude makes a million a year playing wow for 8 hours a day. Will never have sympathy for him. He chose the money over the game, fair enough.

You are 3 weeks behind the rank14 max pace, but that isnt relevant to someone who is aiming for rank 10. Your weekly gains are based solely on your weekly honor and current rank. Starting at 0 now would only hurt you if you were trying to beat other players to certain ranks, it wont make your individual grind any harder.
---
It’s almost as if classic wow reddit is a reflection of the current playerbase.
---
75% of the time the druid won't run into your direction, so you can't fear. If he stays out of range, you can only get up two dots as SL and he can dispell the curse and easily outheal the other one.
---
They should be comparable though, which these things are not comparable. If you find these things to be comparable you have a really unhealthy view of reality.
---
My guild only had 3 drop by the time we got an eye and I spent the next week and a half farming gold and crystals to buy 6 more ingots to get a crafter in guild and finish the arcanite stockpile. Thankfully I had at least 8 arcanite lying around from slowly stockpiling so that saved me around 400g which was about 80% the cost of an ingot.
---
I dont get this. I play a 60 and have been leveling a main through STV and I gotta say I've died less in STV now than I ever did on my main. As far as 60 though I have been corpse camped by full parties but it really isnt anything new. This is just classic
---
most people will get rank 15, and it happens from camping fps and not fighting anyone for hours
---
I’m indifferent. Personally when I went rank 13 I didn’t fit into the “clique” so I said fuck them and tore their shit up. They got mad and had to cater their plan around me. Particularly when their next up GM was very fucking upset the week I purposefully out grinded them as a rank 12. 
---
I actually only think the smaller servers will be able to come plan this sort of shit this time. But they sure will try.
---
They are comparable though just not equal. They both have the same logical basis, but one is more blatantly bad to point out why the other is negative as well even if it's not to the same extent.
---
Ahhhhhh. I quit right before all that.
---
You get the quest from a dead npc in the instance. Need to swim underwater into a little tunnel. Then you kill the boss right before lighting the candles to complete.
---
Doesnt your server only have like 4 alliance lol?
---
&gt;Sure it’s totally not that people who were there in Vanilla and on private servers knew that WOTF, Troll Berserk and Hardiness are OP.
---
Then why are all the biggest pserver tryhards (APES, Progress, GRIZZLY) alliance?
---
&gt;We totally didn’t watch horde Racials get nerfed several times. Over WoWs existence. We totally didn’t watch Every Man For Himself get added to give Alliance a better racial.
---
Notice all of this happened after TBC, where alliance lost their MASSIVE advantage (paladins).
---
Fury dps is fun and easy. What race are you? Depending on if you are human/orc etc it will change your stat priority.
---
you can show your bandaging by installing healcomms. otherwise the unitframes won't show your personal heals.
---
Dude deleting his account.
---
You and your prefectly reasonable and non-hostile hostility.
---
Cancer
---
Thank you tomorrow when we run it will remember must have not been showing on questie for us
---
"I've spent my entire life wanting to kill the Lich King, someone else did it so I better get revenge on life!"
---
Like her story with Lich King could have been completed. Hell she could have become the new Lich King and it would have been more interesting and more in tune with her character. 
---
But no. Instead we have whatever the fuck Blizzard made of her now.
---
I think Stalagg is in a unique position. Most of the Pservers big guilds are in Stalagg and most of them rolled Alliance. We have a strong core of guilds here that isn't afraid.
---
Ascension
---
Deadbeat Dad
---
Fuzion
---
Grizzly (all meme aside they are horde collusion)
---
And I've seen new guilds forming lately. Raid nights has been fun and Hordes cant even stop us. But if you go out solo - good luck.
---
1) Alliance at this stage is THE PVE faction due to Paladins making everything so much easier.
---
2) Paladins are a class not a racial.
---
Atm I’m an arms orc but it seems consensus to switch to fury esp for dps once 60. I do really enjoy the arms rotation tho esp now since I have macros to v easily stance dance.
---
You haven’t really put much thought into what you are saying have you? Illegal is simply a dis-incentive that says that if caught, you will be punished by society. If you will not be punished(which is why I included those qualifiers) then your statement of it being illegal is pointless. In many places, depending on your status, such theft would hold no dis-incentive. 
---
So, I again ask: why doesn’t the analogy hold?
---
So you took a break because your favorite macro doesnt work like you want it to?
---
I mean the really hardcore will have extra accounts, and can have an alliance one, and just feed them mats via neutral ah
---
Fkn elitist douchebags lol. I agree.
---
I'm not being hostile, I was being blunt though. If people take it offensively, thats just a reflection of their own fragility. Name one thing I said that wasn't reasonable or said with good intentions in mind. Raid tanks need to be well informed and thick skinned else they won't get very far.
---
Now that you say it. Yeah it feels like really lazy item design.
---
What third party are they using by having two accounts active at once? Or do you just not understand what multiboxing is
---
&gt;1) Alliance at this stage is THE PVE faction due to Paladins making everything so much easier.
---
Except APES chose NOTHING but dwarves/gnomes, the races that are weak in PVE but have stronger PVP racials. Their choice was based on PVP, not PVE.
---
&gt;2) Paladins are a class not a racial.
---
They are alliance only and an advantage alliance are designed to have over horde.
---
How the fuck could you make server balance worse
---
Why would that mean I don't raid? Taking a FP, Zep, or asking for a port isn't very time consuming.
---
It also doesn't change the way the game plays whatsoever. Just fixes the server imbalance issue they caused by only having 3 realms available during name save day.
---
Same with horde.
---
I don't even play on an rp server and I'm disappointed in you
---
&gt;*i was a fan of the guy*
---
Why? Because 
---
&gt;*the constant whining is kinda pathetic*
---
Was going on lonnnnng before Classic...
---
Yeah confirmed that with the GM, why didn't they just do this with debuffs and leave the buffs tho :(
---
Oh wow, aren't you a bunch of cool kids.
---
Even Sylvanas clearly feels nostalgia and cares about her pre-undead past.
---
there is a shit ton of muslims in china.......
---
Dude it's a video game if you really think you're emasculated by being killed in one you may need to reevaluate some thing.
---
Started harming the unnatural arcane abomination of Ashenvale's pretensions to nature, while acting and living according to their own, actual nature
---
The World Tree, Ashenvale, and Night Elves are ridiculously unnatural.
---
Westfall would love to have ya! Alliance scene is booming , love it here.
---
Fine, as long as your on a pve server.
---
What about moving factions exactly ‘deprives a man of his role or identity’?
---
Someone at blizz has a sylv body pillow and calls her his waifu.
---
Just logged into smolderweb, theres rogues kill people in IF. logged out. wont be back until the "fix" guess we will see if that "fix" actually fixes the game. if not I'll be moving on
---
Also "Anime-esque" is dead on, it's actually pretty funny. Argus the Unmaker is the name of the fight if you want to look it up.
---
My guild called that phase change his Bankai, and many people had macros to spam "psh... nothing personel... kid..."
---
I'm on Earthfury which is Alliance dominant and like the other dude said, they all do the exact same shit. The *exact* same. We have several rogues in Org literally at all hours, and regular FP campers.
---
*Dwarf men and Nightelves are the only decent races in classic on the alliance. 
---
Fixed that for ya
---
undead look like garbage.
---
Streamers are cancer
---
its not that it cant be played, it just cant be played on pvp server, because of blizzard half assed measure.
---
Gnome and Dwarf Racials are NOTHING compared to fear immunity/fear cleanse and a stun resist that can neuter an entire rouge opener. 
---
And yes Paladins are an advantage. I’m PVE. Shamans bring a lot to the table in PvP. And more  than the paladin IMO. Since pala realistically will only be able to heal and will be countered by a rot comp. While shamans can go Hybrid and Ele for burst damage while still bringing in support stuff and off heals.
---
Thorns it is, then, at least for the current raid environment.
---
Mark of tyrany + a threat trinket is what I usually run, smoking heart just isnt that good.
---
Rune of the guard captain and mark of the chosen are just really good, esp when its hard to get good hit pieces for bear form.
---
Worst case you're banned too. More likely anything he gives you is taken away. Don't take it.
---
PvE Realm? I'd rather not even play at all
---
Even Rank 10 will be a massive commitment. A lot of players will invest weeks only to stay stuck at R8-9.
---
Flipping one coin a hundred times and flipping one hundred coins one time will produce identical results. I'm not sure how you expect them to differ?

---
btw simply no point to play wow classic till nax.
---
You can find out your hit% by tallying how much hit% you have on your gear.
---
The best thing you can do for yourself is to read up on exactly what each stat does for warriors and yes you're correct, this is common knowledge!
---
what if its true? people called "no changes" and then, you have the same honor system as 15 years ago, all people knew this before hand, there was no mistery
---
BTW, anyone from Whitemane? Because I almost rolled there and have been wondering how it's doing as far as population.
---
Anyone play Arche Age on the server Oran'Thul was on?
---
Good times.
---
Ah ok coo this makes sense, ty!
---
Arthas.... wait... you knew that right?
---
pvp trinket removes nova
---
The best thing is to understand how aggro works. Then the next step is to divert your resources (threat) accordingly in order to hold as many of the mobs as you can - and yes sometimes its optimal to just let people that do high dps and don't target marked mobs in order to take some of those hits.
---
Lmao. It’s there dude you just didn’t see it. You’re straight lying. When you go to unsub there are multiple options that you can give for the reason you unsub.
---
Did you unsub through the battle net website?
---
Voones also a great option there
---
It's not like they've been known for fifteen years or anything at this point, right?
---
You could just play, and bear with me here, for fun? Crazy idea, I know. Get a fucking life, try-hards.
---
Can confirm. I've had plenty of fun on my priest on the zeppelins. I always eyeball people looking if they gonna make a early jump, if I see them jumping they get a buff.
---
they all left for earthshaker and are having a great time there. nice try tho
---
He can’t heal himself, the person getting bursted because the Palla bubbled, And his entire team. 
---
You pick a shaman depending on the comp. Saying you pick something in place of something else means they usually have the same nieche. But your building a comp. Your a burst comp you likely will have no dot class and focus on Mages/Hunts/Warr and run shammy to give Melee WF. It’s not in place of Warlock, because they really shouldn’t be in a burst comp like that. 
---
Also he will run OOM faster than OOMkin trying to dispel and heal everyone.

No Im with you. Big fan of chad.
---
Grobb!
---
nope, just needed to know who to address my concerns to
---
I think we've both said our peace, and nothing you have said has swayed me from my thought and I'm quite confident it's the same way in reverse. Thanks for the chat, take care.
---
You can out range Simone's 1500 ranged ap debuff, I just kited her like normal after killing the pet and didn't get the 1500 ranged AP debuff. Maybe it was RNG but I basically 1 shotted it. Good guide though OP thanks for sharing, I agree with the strategies except Klinfran can be DPSed normally with the help of a tree branch.
---
&gt;*it’s 10+ opposing faction vs you*
---
Rally your faction to retaliate then instead of trying to solo a multiplayer game?
---
&gt;These guys don't think things through.
---
They're not responsible for the situation, what other choice do they have than to remind people that it's "just two more weeks?"
---
People can choose not to fly in either...
---
Yeah I recall that. But that was only a small fraction for those who paid attention to the forums. There are a lot that never bother with that sort of thing. Many other MMOs have had that in the past, sort of helped things stay somewhat balanced.
---
Well they wouldn’t know I knew before hand.. but I get your point. Not really trying to jeopardize my account. He even offered to buy me stuff and send it. I denied that too. Just the option was tempting
---
So right click it you piece of scum garbage
---
Yup, I've canceled and absolutely not coming back.
---
&gt; It sounds tempting until 4/5s of your play session is corpse running or watching 5-6 horde players throw themselves at you the second you respawn and tea bag your corpse for the crime of playing the game.
---
That's them telling you to reroll horde, Who knew all the horde PvPers were just really huge carebears that wants all the people to play with?
---
/sarcasm
---
Typical redditors to overreact and judge people from one shitpost to be fair. "you don't like weebs, good like adjusting to the world", what a tool lmao.
---
Yep
---
Good joke
---
Great video! Honestly Skeram isn't anything more than a social experiment at this point
---
Ya but where
---
What do you mean close to balanced? Fire Maw is probably the most inbalanced server in EU right now.
---
Yes. The forsaken always were evil, while the rest of the horde was borderline, just one bfa step away from evil.
---
Feel-good classic NA server? i wanna be excited for winter veil and feel like part of a community
---
Haha I'm fully aware and I by no means think stealing is equivalent to killing a person in a video game. The logical basis behind both statements he made though are exactly the same. Both are unethical things for self benefits that hold jobs negative repercussions.
---
People complain about camping even when its even or slightly imbalanced.
---
The issue is people notice getting camped more than tnotice steamrolling the other faction.
---
Only played wrath before. So no it hasn’t been actually for me.
---
Yeah it's odd, im not even comming from a "streamers bad" thing it's not for me but to each their own. But the god type worship some of these people give out is outright creepy.
---
HARK!
---
Negotiate, trade, or find trees else where, take your pick.
---
Deadly boss mods.
---
Wow, so you basically say I shouldnt compete in a competetive game?
---
And again, you didnt aswer my question. What should 60% of the players do? 
---
You will never have an answert to it. You just repeat the same bullshit again and again: The player are the problem. Even though Blizzard has every tool in their hands to prevent stuff like this.
---
Ah yes I have no idea. Not the person who claimed Paladins were a racial and kept trying to move the goalpost.
---
So do you not use addons
---
No words were even said.  They just started blastin’.
---
Of course the orcs are gonna fight back.  Can’t talk to arrows as they fly at you.
---
You’re fundamentally not understanding the concept.
---
Its not even 45+. It’s been like that in pretty much every contested area. I don’t think I’ve ever been in a contested zone where the horde weren’t everywhere you looked, and of course they always kill on sight.
---
https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17617561597
---
There are several posts, US and EU, that talk about Mages being able to make and equip Thunderfury. Just because that binding is, doesn't mean the finished product is.
---
After a bit of digging, seems like I misremembered the era. According to Gamepedia, Mages were able to obtain the quest starting in [Patch 3.1.1](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Thunderfury,_Blessed_Blade_of_the_Windseeker). See the patch notes at the bottom.
---
Min maxing time is super important when you come home from work and have shit to do before raid and don't necessarily have time to take 20+ minutes to make it all the way to Kargath. 
---
If you have time and don't mind doing that before every MC / BRD / LBRS / UBRS run then that's completely fine.
---
all i remember on my server was some dude named orcshaman that always sat in them middle of the trade distract.... in stormwind. he was a human paladin.
---
Dont be cocky
---
You're right, I forgot about DM because I don't need anything else there.
---
The top end rewards are bwl+ type loot.  Usually with stam included for pvp but the other stats or +spellpower or just raw dps are better than any raid items at the moment by a longshot.
---
That's the thing, you took it seriously and now you're just blaming me out of defensiveness.
---
You read my post as an attack on masculinity and responded by attacking me.  I provided you a definition and you said I need to reevaluate myself (while still not reading the definition).  Then when I write it out without using the word that triggers you and I took it too seriously.  
---
And now, of course, since I took the time to explain this all to you, it is evidence that I took it too seriously
---
If you'd prefer that over walking, sure?
---
Well she did actually kill him with the new cinematic.

Which is part of why naxx is a guild killer. Tanks got poached like crazy for 4hm.

Oh hey! Walus here, I quit a number of years ago but am still humping mailboxes irl.

This is so sweet and wholesome.
---
Broxxigar isn't a real character
---
Malfurion didn't remember Broxxigar's sacrifice because it hadn't happened when classic's lore was written. 
---
That's the biggest problem with Warcraft lore as it grew past Classic— the retcons are so heavy and so frequent you might as well not accept any part of the story as being canon at any point because it's all subject to change.
---
Damage removes cannibalize fyi. You may be able to get 1 tick in vs 1 dot, but it's rarely that useful in pvp as people usually apply at least one dot to rogues on purpose. Warriors will have rend + deep wounds, locks will have corruption + coa, rogues will either rupture or 100-0 during cc lock. Etc. Wotf = 2 utility or dps trinkets. That's the tradeoff.
---
I would love for you to see what it’s like for us. It’s like how you feel, but EVERYWHERE. We can’t escape the horde death balls.
---
The horde beat the pvp game since the alliance seem allergic to forming a raid to fight back and rather sit in ironforge.
---
Can confirm. Deviate Delight has very little RP.. kind of disappointed actually.
---
People take this stuff way too seriously on both sides.
---
The information has been out there for that long. You could have typed fewer words into Google than you did in your comment to answer your "biggest question"...
---
pm me the site..... so i know to stay away .....
---
I solo’d it while leveling, as a warrior (outside of the few that were in the instance, and even then I had to backtrack and solo them after we cleared) it wasn’t too bad, you can kite them and bandage. They are near ledges for the most part and a cooldown like retaliation will shift the tide quick.
---
It looks better and I'm quite jealous they can opt into it when in the mood.
---
You’re so right, that’s absolutely a Horde problem. Not a people problem. Or a game design problem. It’s definitely the problem of a made up faction in a video game lol.
---
Accepted demons, destroyed your own planet, invade an innocent planet and kill the innocent people there. Yeah, you're the baddies lol
---
You clearly have no conception of how bad the issue currently is.
---
There are also realm forums on the wow site you could advertise
---
"Everyone and their mother" also demanded an auction house in Diablo 3 and it ended up being a colossal mistake. Just because a majority (or loud minority) demands something doesn't mean it's a good idea.

Look just cuz he has a few less teeth than the average person doesn’t mean  hes a meth head

It was 65/35 from day one you looney.

Spec prot for gear, respec when u get gear.
---
Flamelash
---
Old Blanchy
---
Like I said, it is “high” population regardless of how many people are logged in because the server was classified as high population a few weeks ago. They changed it so these population indicators are not updated in real time. Currently, Flamelash is now a low-medium server but it will take a few weeks for the marker to update to this.
---
Warriors are one of the weaker 29 twinks. Without intercept, you'll get kited easily by hunters/mages. And no fear break.
---
Pally is really strong in 29s if you want a twink with a big wompin stick.

as far as hobbies go that's pretty cheap

try anything involving cars
---
They bought it upon themselves
---
Looool take about 70% off there bud
---
I throw that shit on everyone man.
---
No matter what server or faction you will have Rogues ganking people in main cities.
---
But, there's PvE. You remember that right? Cause vanilla wow is, by a pretty large margin, a PvE focused game by design. You remember. God, you're salty.
---
You're missing the point where the Elves are the one fighting back. If you walked into your grandparents house and someone was killing your grandparents and cousins, do calmly ask what they are doing or attack/disarm the person attacking your family?
---
think r11 is the highest you can go if your life is on track.
---
Anyone know of a balanced PvP East Coast server?
---
They weren't "on the losing side." They were do massively outnumbered because of the ludicrous server caps, that no contest ever existed. You can be in a PvP group and kill 2-3x your groups number, and still you had to run for your life. Because 10x your number would immediately start moving to your position.
---
It's like claiming a skillful win for a herd of zombies surrounding one guy, and pretending it was an equal fight.
---
The OP link was, and no. You can't. They're all also surrounded by their own herd of zombies.
---
I have a buddy like you who has a weird shift. You could maybe find guilds that raid at "off-peak" times. When I was looking for guilds before classic my number 1 prerequisite was the raid times for not only myself, but a couple of friends of mine who also play. You could maybe look into EU servers or whatever to find raid times that fit your needs, GL!
---
Peep Show FTW
---
Hit capped for abilities obviously (that's what hit cap means 99% of the time since the full DW hit cap is impossible to even get close to)
---
And once you reach the ability hit cap, hit rating gets largely diminished in value and you should focus on strength and crit instead
---
I only used mana and heal potions. Warlock for silithus boss and rest were not a real issue..other than the constant horde ganks
---
The primary benefit is aoe tanking. Tanking one mob you're gonna need to block basically 100% of swings for around a minute to equal the amount of threat from a heroic strike.
---
It's an aoe/dungeon shield.
---
I actually checked at the time. Zero Horde, ha.
---
I'd also ask that about polymorph. In Hearthstone it works way better. Imagine someone dings 60 and you sheep them, permanently
---
That was fixed immediately
---
Anyone that thinks faction imbalance isn't an issue is just stupid. Its not fun for either side. The only people who like it are people that really want a PVE server but like to be able to kill outnumbered stragglers sometimes.
---
I mean I feel bad that you’re getting camped that hard but it is literally part of the game. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t like it either, but that’s how it is. Of course the horde on whatever server you’re in are pressing their advantage if the factions are that imbalanced. Why would you expect them to do any different? I don’t think it makes them bad people though. They’re just exploiting an outdated system.
---
How do you know he deleted his account and not just his comments?
---
&gt; It is clear a lot of people didn’t know what to expect when they roll in a PVP server
---
Folks like you or I, that were active here, and eagerly awaited the launch of classic did.
---
Everyone else, absolutely did not. Because there was nothing to warn them about it. Even this subreddit was split on how bad it would be. 
---
So, despite agreeing with you on principle, that yes, PvP happens, I still have sympathy for people that rolled PvP and now cannot play.
---
&gt;*The OP link was*
---
Please quote where the OP is claiming x-on-1 is an equal fight...
---
&gt;*no. You can't.*
---
Yes, you can. Be social in a *massively multiplayer* game...
---
No choice is a choice for the vast majority of people lmao.
---
Trinket nova. Be survival for bigger melee hits. Spider belt also helps. Viper conc multi when you get the distance between blinks. Nade a cast or to create distance for a viper
---
Except battlegrounds are cross realm so it won’t matter
---
I agree you're right. 
---
Laying collective responsibility on individual players isnt productive.
---
I stopped playing Classic for the sole reason that  
---
I hate everyone in the community.
---
Oh please, we don’t move to black rock without a few raid groups either. And I get rolled by rolling groups of alliance every time I leave a main city to do anything. 
---
Pretty much every farming spot on the server (silithus, everlook, plaguelands to name a few) are dominated by alliance constantly. 
---
Alliance also own the path from kargath to black rock. I can’t even count the number of times I’ve been spawn camped there.
---
I think he was bullshiting you. As another healer every scholo run that I have done it is only been me and casters rolling on those. Not to say that a hunter couldn't use them but to me it seems unprecedented.
---
Hyperbole is basically the only thing the internet does well.
---
Thing is, they’d have no idea that you DIDN’t know before hand. I’ve heard horror stories of people being banned because they bought illegal items on the AH (item’s that people purchased with bought gold, to than sell for ‘legit gold.’ So, honestly, probably not worth the risk.
---
All they see is illegal funds being transferred from one party, to another, and than to another.  In some ways, I believe in the real world, this would be considered money laundering.
---
Don’t beat around the bush go on and buy it. We all know there is no “brother” buying it before you. You just wanna know if you can buy gold without any repercussion. And the answer to that is yes. Nothing will happen to your account. 
---
About 30% of all accounts are gold selling accounts (at least that’s what I have read somewhere), there is no way Blizzard would be able to control every single gold trading method.
---
I'd rather the evil faction than the boring one
---
Now that asmonchode quit it very well could be.
---
Don’t forget 8 out of 10 cats does countdown!
---
At least he has an argument. You're being nothing but negative while offering no solutions.
---
Jarod, Cenarius And innumerable others. 
---
Also I have issues with assuming a race with a long ass lifespan that preaches about ancestors and nature would forget someone who traveled from the future, saved them, and died for them. The Night Elves hold long as fuck grudges for thousand of years. I think something as big as dieing for you and wounding Sargeras is big enough for them to not forget them.
---
Nah, had a much better time in vanilla, given up hoping classic will be as good.
---
There are several things that affect your chance to hit. Level difference, your weapon skill vs the mob defense skill, etc. Once all that math is done, you add your gear +% to hit.
---
If you are lvl 60 with 300 weapon skill, then this applies:
---
&gt;\* v. Level 60 mob: 5.0% / dual-wield: 24%      
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\* v. Level 61 mob: 5.5% / dual-wield: 24.5%     
---
&gt;\* v. Level 62 mob: 6.0% / dual-wield: 25%      
---
&gt;\* v. Level 63 mob: 9.0% / dual-wield: 28% 
---
So you need +9% against a lvl 63 mob.
---
Taken from  [here](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hit).
---
I cannot fucking understand this mentality. How can you assign collective guilt to individuals and expect it to be productive.
---
Fuck whose at fault! Who CAN fix it? The developers!!
---
What about the topic-of-the-day quitters?
---
Thats stupid logic
---
&gt; sociopathic
---
ohhh, they don't like that word at all.  get ready to get flamed.
---
Yep, I’m just confused as to why they won’t just combine the horde and ally dominated servers at this point as giant servers, maybe layering would be needed but if there are big servers already anyway I don’t see the downside.
---
Take taladril's Google doc and download it. Go through and delete anything from beyond phase 2 and the rank 11 and higher items. Don't think that just because one item is strictly better than another unless they are just worlds apart.
---
As for FR gear here is my current set.
---

Helm, chest, legs from elemental leatherworking.
---
Boots from tribal leatherworking.
---
Shoulders come from majordomo but elemental leatherworking can make one too.
---
Neck is Onyxia attunement neck.
---
Rings are from the auction house.
---
Ward of the elements is from a quest.
---
Weapon is also from majordomo. 
---
Molten Helm and Volcanic Leggings each have a +20 fire resistance enchant from the Libram of Resilience.
---
With a paladin in my group with fire resist aura up I have exactly 315 fire resist which is exactly the cap for a lvl 63 (raid boss) mob.
---
The Molten Helm and Corehound Boots require materials from Molten Core trash mobs and the leatherworker to have reputation with the Thorium Brotherhood  for access to the patterns. Hopefully your guild will help you with these. They will if they are serious about killing Rag.
---
I may be a bit biased, but imo bears are the optimal Rag tank. We can reach high levels of FR without sacrificing as much hp or other avoidance stats like block and parry all while consistently putting out the most single target threat per second in the MF'in game right now. Wrath of Rag has punted me exactly 1 time in the last 3 weeks and I'm averaging 60% of his attacks being resisted or dodged, and mind you I have 10% dodge in my FR gear.

As for upgrades from MC for tanking in general: Band of Accuria, Stormshroud Cloak or Dragon's Blood Cape, Heavy Dark Iron Ring (AMAZING), firegaurd shoulders, Medallion of Steadfast Might. Not a ton of upgrades in MC for bears so hang tight for some awesome pieces in BWL and for the Holy Mecca for feral druids in AQ40.
---
&gt;They can't seriously expect this to be accepted
---
I hate to point this out, but the players did this to themselves.
---
I’m rocking 0 / 21 / 30. I have 8/8 t1 and can still 1 round clothies with aimed multi auto. Melee hits are huge as well with the staff
---
Awesome pet I love my whelpling they are so animated and lively cute little buggers.
---
His argument is that players are completely innocent snowflakes. You're not fooling anyone with half a brain.
---
Guild is using dkp, leaders want to reset the table for phase 3 to stop hoarding. What are some other pros and cons of a dkp reset?.
---
What argument? That player should not play because if they play they just hurt other players? 
---
Blizzard should implement faction specific queue times, is that enough of a solution?
---
You complain might be right, however this complain, as the 500 former complaints about the same damn thing with various solution suggestions won't change a damn thing. It's just a repetitive complaint, nothing more nothing less.
---
What's a good pve realm to roll an alliance alt?
---
quit classic or just switched servers?
---
Wow ty! this def provides some clarity, I feel bad trying to get ppl to explain things like this to me as obv is can get a bit messy and not so straight forward.
---
People tend to forget that wow is a video game.
---
Why blame the players for something Blizzard did? If a person buy a pet and it fucks up their house, do you blame the pet or the owner? The owner. They didn't put the effort in to make sure things would be okay. It's like saying 
---
&gt;"WTF MY CAT PISSED EVERYWHERE, but I believe in free-range urination for my cats NOLITTERBOXES. You did this to yourself cats!"
---
Yes it’s part of the game, but they have some agency.  You’re not obligated to exploit and break everything you play.  You have an option to abstain.  Simply put, I think less of you if you participate in this shit, blaming the developers doesn’t wash your hands clean.
---
Just cause I think its a cool idea worth a try
---
Not be horrible to other players? It's as simple as "gosh, killing this person would be a dick move...I shouldn't do it". Instead of camping the people that have no way of winning, maybe restrict your PvP to people within your level range.
---
Again, you dont answer my question. How do I get honor if I cant farm honor? 
---
So people shouldnt play? In a competetive game? With months to grind to Rank 14? How about you leave your fairytail world?
---
&gt; Yes, they are, and you are a good example of this. You need an authority figure and official rules in order not to be a complete asshole, and if such rules are lacking you will make everyone else as miserable as possible and pretend you are innocent. 
---
Oh yea please, and Rogues should never attack a blue equiped priest with only 2400HP  because they can oneshot him.
---
Noone knew how the server balance were, is or will be, because Blizzard refused to publish any faction numbers and still refused to implement any faction queues. 
---
So it is completely Blizzards fault.
---
Mimimi same post mimimi not addressing the situation and providing nothing to the post mimimi
---
I mean.. I’m not buying. My brother bought. I’ve read countless things on buying gold and know not to.. this is a whole nother situation .
---
Big Saurfang energy
---
HCIM btw
---

---
No. Raid logging til Tuesday (which I'm fucking buzzing for though)
---
Person i was responding to said it's entirely blizzard's fault. Read properly next time.
---
&gt;Blizzard could work on a fix but y'all would rather wank each other off in the comments over how the players deserve their broken server.
---
Why do you like to come up with all these fallacious arguments? Blizzard can, and should, work on a fix. At the same time, the players are (partially) to blame for the current situation. It's possible for two things to coexist, but maybe not in your tiny brain.
---
Can anyone TLDR?
---
Blackblade is really good for buffing your party so let your raid leader know that, you give 25% haste with the proc. You should slam with every single autoattack and use excess rage for bloodthirst, and beyond that whirlwind. Just make sure to cast the next spell right after slam so the gcd is up by the time you need to cast slam again. You need to be fury/arms specced, flurry is really what makes 2h kind of work. The dps will not be great, as you need something like OEB or BRE for decent dps, but if you are giving the blackblade buff to 4 other melee dps or tanks, it's going to be worth it.

sad part would be if he had a wife and a couple of kids, imagine their lives then.
---

---
Here we see a horde trying to avoid this becoming a reoccurring thing cuz he likes his 70/30 H dominated realm :)
---
Ahh yeah that makes sense. Thanks for the input !
---
awesome
---
I mean... it's not, but sounds like certain servers people don't think the pvp there is "real" pvp either
---
Tell me again why this dude is your real id friend?
---
It doesn't really need it's own setting or option. People have been doing these since vanilla.
---
Fair enough man, I have a buddy who does that. He pvps with me but he’s a warrior lol
---
Just having 2 factions is drama enough.
---
Its easy. Offer first free realm transfers.
---
Asides from what others have commented (Mana issues, getting familiar with dungeons, knowing how the other members act etc) I would also like to know about threat. If one of the dps gets threat, in a bigger pull, should I risk getting all the mobs from that said dps to heal him? Is there a good healing spell that causes less threat that I can use on them? Renew, maybe? Or should I just focus on the tank and afterwards rez the dps who died during the pull?
---
Just a tip. Read around before choosing a server. For example: my server (thunderfury) SEEMS balanced but is very horde dominated. Good luck on your search!
---
Just because some species/people look like a guy you barely knew then thousands years ago and the guys was a bro, doesn't mean the other people would be. If I come home to a dog attacking my family I am not going to be like, nah dogs are cool I had one once, I am going to fuck that dog up.
---
Who/what is NES? If you mean Night Elves, where did they have a treaty?
---
I know what he said you just come off as a much more insufferable human being.
---
ofc aren't we all
---
Are you ok?
---
This. People forget that enough voices will eventually be heard. The pessimism sucks but its expected. Things can be done to change the health of the game, even if the hivemind has trouble getting on board with that right now. It just sucls that we have to likely be more drastic with what we do compared to what could've done been just a couple months ago.
---
So if you want to play wow on hard roll a ne war on flamelash. Not going to lie tho I love how the horde on that server destroyed themselves. Kind of like a virus...
---
Alright buddy lol
---
Almost all the servers that are dominated by Horde are PvP servers.
---
Almost all the servers that are dominated by Alliance are PvE servers.
---
Thank you. That Mana issue is really important because if I run out of mana and mana potions I can't really do much to help during a pull. Idk why some tanks don't wait for their healers mana regeneration since it's so important to them.
---
I've genuinely lost interest in playing now. There's no point. I can't even play the fucking game. I'll be in the most obscure location in a zone and out of nowhere, "beep beep! Lvl 60 horde coming for that honor". It's so rage inducing that I don't want to play. What's the point of paying for a game that you can't play?!
---
Small person irl == small person in game. Difference is, in game they can grieve to feel less small.
---
You know that’s not the same situation. 
---
Also funny how you say THAT dog when Cenarius wanted to go full genocide. 
---
And in WoW there was a treaty so the horde could get lumber for durotar.
---
He’s no good to me dead/ragequit.
---
TLDR: Even if you reduce a faction from 100% to 25% size, honor farmers will probably make up less than the 25% of the faction playing. They will still all be able to log on and farm you if they log on early enough.
---
After 30 minutes of taking 5 steps and dying repeatedly  to the same 11 people camping your corpse as you try to run to BRD day after day after day.... Yeah some folks say eff this lol
---
What type of gear should a warrior have to 2 man jump runs?
---
I believe they don’t last as long as they did in original
---
We're specifically talking about the Night Elves defending themselves against "the demonic minions of the burning legion" or something like that, which if you recall, was something that happened before Grom killed Mannoroth,
---
They do it because they know a large amount of players will recreate their characters and spend more time.
---
Why does anyone think Blizzard won't act like Retail in Classic?
---
he added me i dont know how thought he was gonna say GF or something idk but yea that happned
---
Thanks. I think I'll drink if I'm around 60% mana or less. Gonna see from experience how it works.

i feel like this gigantic world pvp shitstorm was the calm before the storm that will be the Horde dominating bgs in ways that most haven't even imagined yet
---
i wonder if cross-realm bgs will show up in vanilla. who knows: that could be an even BIGGER shitstorm... imagine one horde group dominating the entire goddamned battlegroup
---
On one had I’m really annoyed a warrior or pally couldn’t take that, But on the OTHER hand that’s fucking hilarious
---
You're exempt from that problem because
---
&gt; wanted to play a warlock
---
&gt; **warlock**
---
Aka the class with the free 40 mount that's not a robochicken and a half cost epic fire pony at 60.
---
Just out of curiosity, but cant you give Blizz these screenshots and have this nerd banned?
---
Well Blizzard didn’t implement faction queues and then the first server died.
---
Can I get a new link to the discord?  That link has expired.
---
Naw, he mad as hell, bc he ally pally.
---
Well, pulling multiples is mainly about keeping moving, to maintain space between you and adds, or pulling with your throwing knives if you don't actually feel good about fighting 2 mobs.
---
Against tough mobs, like for example, elementals, using your rage effectively on demoralizing shout and thunder clap can make a big difference, and buff consumables are hugely valuable. buff food is a very meaningful margin of safety, and at level 20, when combined with even very weak elixirs, like minor fortitude, it can make a big difference. 
---
Beyond that, I really can't stress enough the importance of gear. What is your "decent armor" like? What's your worst piece?
---
I will note, a lot of the time, you can pick up steals on the auction house for not a ton over vendor value. Not always, but if you just look every time you are in town, you will see options. It can be VERY cheap to "rent" a piece of armor for 5 levels and then vendor it for 2/3 of what you paid for it. 
---
I will say, it gets a LOT easier when you get sweeping strikes. It truly is a complete game changer. It quadruples your dps for those 5 charges, and it's on a ridiculously short cooldown.
---
Ahhh, jut like my friend was wondering if I sell his account how much he would get... asking for a friend of course...

---
easy rank 14(13) and wait for paid transfer. seems like a great server for alliance
---
looks sweet on a boomkin I bet
---
Exactly, horde wanted classic because retail is dead and they have no Alli to kill.  Horde try and overwhelm and create faction imbalance on purpose.
---
Conquer online kinda had this, you would go to the item mall and people could buy items from your shop
---
This same shit happens in every MMORPG. It happened way before in Ultima Online. It was way worse in Ultima Online. This isn’t anything remotely new.
---
How do you actually get the mace? I know you need to get exalted with the stormpike guard but what currency do you use to purchase it?
---
Why not play a different game if you don't actually like this one? Why think you have to resort to "drastic" measures to get the game bent to your will?
---
Pallys are OP tho that’s why pussies play alliance everyone knows this...
---
Maybe if you’re 16 years old
---
This is why I love classic
---
There is no heal spell with less threat caused as far as I know. I might be wrong since I didn't really thought about this. The answer is yes you want to heal / keep dps alive ofc with the risk you get the aggro. First thing to do shield your dps, top him or renew depends on dmg. Sometimes renew alone is enough. In terms of threat and if you are scared of it, keep fade on cool down while pulls! If fade doesn't work and you still got aggro, shield and  maybe renew yourself and walk straight to the tank. It is his (and other dps) job to take adds from you, so heal can go through. When things go wrong and you see you can't keep both (tank and dps alive) heal the tank, dps has to live with a rez after pull. Anything else you want to know?
---
If you say so buddy.  Troll on.
---
Let me guess - "It's OK cause it gives us more moniez"?
---
Yes, saying that people shouldnt be complete assholes just because it's officially allowed is insufferable.
---
Irony here is that if you need to rely on official rules to not be a complete twat, you're the insufferable one.
---
It' s blatant p2w, though.
---
Anyone know how the brackets are gonna work? Are level 60s gonna be in their own bracket for WSG?
---
If so, I might keep my alt at 59 while I farm BiS and honor so I don't have to get them an epic mount straight away.
---
Horde flair checks out lmao
---
Lol rogues... After 4 sec of initiating, there'd be 10 allies on you
---
‘But horde are just PKing because they need honor’.
---
Yeh not sure how many honor points killing a level 1 gives...
---
No u
---
It also doubly punishes the alliance though. Any alliance trying to level would be permanently farmed for honor on those servers. Definitely won't have the effect you think.
---
Saw something about getting a mount through AV or something like that, what are the requirements and would it be cheaper or the same as buying a normal epic mount? Tbh I’m only really interested if it saves gold I just thought I saw someone say it was cheaper or something.
---
Come to bigglesworth. I’ve been playing since launch and am barely 40 play a couple hours a day on weeknights. Chilling and enjoying
---
Each person can only leave one skeleton. When you die again, your old skeleton disappears. In vanilla, one person could fill the floor with skeletons if they died over and over.
---
Then why are you still in this subreddit?
---
Go fuck off
---
Not heartseeker. It’s the inverse of stalagg.
---
No world buffs? Get real
---
Why not coordinate two or three of those 3-man groups that your server is swarming with to fight back then?
---
And the hyperbole comment was on the "can't go *anywhere*", not the raid definition, just FYI...
---
I was just thinking anytime you need aoe you either use multiple tanks or just aoe taunt.
---
Thank you very much for that :)
---
Solution is faction queues. Either implement now and contain the problem, or implement later in a desperate attempt to save the game when servers start collapsing.
---
Even just leveling in dungeons it’s a breeze. You go from tanking one instance and afterwards the healer leaves and you see a warrior looking for group so you invite him and throw on your healing gear so he can tank, damn it’s a great feeling being so useful to a group.
---
What a cunt
---
No, that's all and was very useful advice. :) Gonna do that when the time comes.
---
Please, enlighten me.
---
I’d you want solo self found play an ARPG
---
How could diplomacy work for the horde too if Cenarius decided because of the legion taint that all of them deserved to die. 
---
“ There is never any proof that Cenarius had any plans to genocide the Orcs or even leave Ashenvale.” Wanting to kill anyone with a trait that is the default of the race (Because very few Orcs aren’t green) is genocide. You can commit genocide in your own borders.
---
And it’s not the same situation because your not declaring to kill all dogs.
---
Also the NEs had info on the Orcs and the Orcs didn’t. They had the cards to play diplomat or fight and chose to fight. You can’t speak to a dog. You can speak to an Orc. And that’s the funniest part of it. The fucking night elves went hung ho with Cenarius and all that happened was Grom chugged more demon blood and Cenarius got his bitch ass destroyed. All because they didn’t wanna play diplomacy.
---
The discussion is that alliance sucks, quit their server because they couldn’t handle it. Story over.
---
Well then, I would never go there (deletes dwarf paladin).
---
This is 100% inaccurate.  You’ll find that the majority of people give zero fucks about pvp.
---
The game now is a shit show. Wait for BGs, if it is not getting any better, the game is not worth playing.
---
Download HealsComm. Best healer add-on hands down
---
Lol like you can participate in half the game on a pvp server getting corpse camped
---
But you only get 3 uses out of it...
---
There's an officers lounge in Orgrimmar/Stormwind that you need to be rank 6 to enter.
---
I experienced something similar earlier this week, I killed a rogue before he could stealth(so he didn’t get the opener), and came on the Alliance side to call me the F and N word, and brag about his logs and how much he’s better than me etc.
---
You can chose not to participate in an awful system. Stop diverting the blame.
---
*Haha, red team bad. Haha.*
---
It's there, you can read it. No need to guess.
---
Grow up. Such a baby.
---
Nah the dude is a prick and I kind of hope he gets his own karma and is hit by a bus. There are some people who are just useless shits, and that appears to be one of them.
---
No one gets Medand besides Medan. Especially Brox. He’s a fan and dev favorite. Otherwise he wouldn’t show up in legion.
---
Thought technically Medan isn’t retconned out. He’s just 404d.
---
Oh so it’s a friend now thought it was your brother? Can’t keep your story straight bro!!
---
because that's not the rallying cry. everyone seems to think it is, but it isn't. the rallying cry is "For Khaz Modan!". say it out loud and tell me I'm wrong.
---
The most active griefers are the ones that do.
---
This ^^
---
This is what I did in vanilla. OT some fights, raid healed some other fights.  Loved it.
---
What a top lad
---
Nice name and shame
---
Shame it doesnt show honourless targets tho
---
I disagree about defense being overrated. The biggest flaw with defense is you don't seem to generate as much threat but it helps you not die.
---
And you could have typed fewer words by not responding at all? But you’ve choose to do so twice? Fucking loser get a life Christ
---
how dare he lose in a single pvp battle
---
We've already been down that road, thats what lead to BFA.
---
If you can, stop wearing 8/8, it's way overkill. If you're human Mirahs.
---
That sounds like the WoW equivalent of sucking dick for coke.  How does rock bottom feel?
---
I'm full of shit
---
You open a ticket. Implying to commit suicide is a very bad idea in any multiplayer game. Just open a ticket, mention the server and include date or timestamps. Dude will regret it.
---
"I want to play a shitty version of the game, because muh nostalgia ;_;"
---
Naw that's no the reason. You mad bro ;)
---
Shadow priest heals fine for dungeons, that or Ele Shaman for Horde.
---
Myzrael had the best faction balance, I believe, back in september. It's quite active. Atiesh, I think has a larger population, but may be less balanced. 
---
Westfall had absolutely horrific faction balance but is still quite active and is east coast if that's important to you. Frankly though, this might not matter as they all may be 95% alliance by now, the census addons I believe have been broken for months now. 
---
Really, those are the 3 I would think about starting out on. I have characters on both myzrael and atiesh and find that they are fairly active.  Typical auction house listings would suggest that the total pop on alliance atiesh is about 30% higher than alliance westfall, as a rough guess.
---
You don't want to invest in a new one *because* you've already invested in the current one. Sunk cost fallacy.
---
My server is fine tho lol
---
It's a game man, if you don't enjoy the game then idk quit, play PVE, or go to retail
---
The 15% Extra sunder threat though.
---
I found mine on faerlina day 1 and little dragon dude kept a solo warrior very happy along the journey.
---
That last part of the video is hilarious!. I am a lvl 55 warrior on Anathema and I haven't played in 2 weeks. The gank actually feels kinda bad. Our guild went to go ruin a raid group and I actually just felt bad about the whole thing. I haven't been on since.
---
HORDE?! I’m shocked! Shocked I say!
---
Yea, just shows how delusional you really are. Skirmishes like 80 vs 20 is a nice skirmish. Will last long. City raids, also a good one. Camping the enemy before they get to the FPs.
---
But go ahead with your personal attack. 
---
Its still Blizzards fault, no matter how much you defend it. Blizzard sets the rules. And they said its ok to have 80:20 server.
---
from what im told we have killed him a bunch with my reckoning bombs with hand of rag haha guess he didnt like that but his name stiill doesnt ring a bell to me
---
The funny thing is, 12 hours a day won’t be enough
---
Hey man, I’m not planning on plaguing or zombifying anyone. I’be got way more respect for Saurfang than Sylvanas any way.
---
You clearly want a pve game and are completely devoid of wanting any challenge or balance in your wow life. I dont think you care about the health of the game, and I dont think you even understand what's happening.
---
&gt;They just didn't expect how the massive increase in server populations would affect gameplay in the open world
---
Right, but its Blizzard's job to figure that out. Therefore, this problem is ultimately Blizzard's fault. I say this as an Ally player on a slightly Horde favored server. The Horde players are just playing the game given the incentives the game systems provide. Blizzard made two massive fuckups 1) Not having enough servers up for people to go to at the very start when pre-character creation was released, and 2)Not releasing BGs with the honor system. 
---
90% of the problems with Classic are because Blizzard failed spectacularly at estimating the number of people who would play Classic and not having enough servers available as a result of that flawed belief.
---
Tears are cool until there's nobody to play against
---
Ugh I feel you I’m still trying to get the bow. I think carapace crossbow is still technically better but ABB looks soooo good.
---
Swamp man good?
---
Are you surprised?
---
The server was literally self-branded as the anti-streamer server. Anyone who went into that realm not thinking it wouldn’t be as bad as the streamer server with a bunch of pompous losers is delusional.
---
Time and attendance is definitely effort as far as raiding goes, and you doing 1 week of raiding and being on the same standing as someone who has 4 weeks of raiding (and is mostly likely contributing more than you, because they have put in the time to improve their character) is not fair
---
What do you mean cross faction whispers?? How does it work?
---
This is why I rolled PvE.
---
How is trying to dps in 5 mans? do you end up getting closed out as all the mages are trying to compete with you on gear and the healer wants all the same cloth? or do you find you are fairly accepted? 
---
also, I was kinda thinking alliance, as my bank alt for my gnome warrior can't really be a shaman.
---
"look other people agree"
---
I see someone has a degree in logical fallacy, keep it up lol
---
Always ask the mage for water. Make sure you stock  some before the last boss. If you feel like you should be drinking as soon as combat ends, then you are right.
---
Best thing to do is get in there and heal. Seeing how your spells land isthe best way to learn. Don't be afraid to downrank and experiment to find your best playstyle. Some people will tell you to never bubble warrior or druids, but if they are full rage or about to die,do it. It's only an issue if they can't hold aggro because they have no rage. It does not stop all rage generation. 
---
Look up stat weights for a better idea of what stats to be looking at. +Heals, mp5, spell crit, spirit, and int are the only things you should worry about. 
---
Good luck and enjoy the keeping the bars up game!
---
Get comfortable using fade. It's huge for dropping aggro when you heal too much
---
It’s not a spec I’d ever stick to, just some noodling around with something weird while we have mc/ony on farm. The *actual* drawback would be me specced for dps instead of MTing. Like, I’m only interested in it for the weapon. I have no plans to dps and no reason to besides just for fun.
---
Either way, thank you for the suggestions. I might try it out when my respec fee decays a bit.
---
&gt;	gloating on reddit about not being able to participate in half of the game
---
Battlegrounds
---
Its not like Blizzard hasnt invented faction transfers yet. Offer them up on BG release and see if people are willing to make the switch for faster BG queues.
---
Are you hit capped ?
---
Sorry, I was responding as a member of the group addressed in "the people of the #nochangescrowd..."
---
Do you have an issue with that?
---
It exists on PvE servers.
---
Keep blaming other people for your decisions.
---
We use DKP but if nobody rolls we discount it slightly for the o/s who don't want to spend a ton
---
I do. Only thing I'm saying that your post #501 about the same issue does not help, it annoys people. How did any comment regarding the actual problem in this particular post brought you closer to solving the issue at hand. None. There were no new suggestions for a solution. There were no comments about new things, which are not known by most of all players. It's repetitive and does not generate any additionally input.
---
I think the miscommunication here is that I will continue to invest time in the current one and not stop investing time at all
---
So it *is* an option. Just not the one they choose.
---
Ima laugh at this comment in a few days when you’re complaining about the BG ques with literally no other way to farm honor. Hope you’re part of the 1% who actually have the talent to hit that rank 14
---
Blizzard only bans sellers, never the buyers. Why would they ban you? They allow multiboxing which is basically cheating, has much more impact than buying gold and they still allow it because they want the subscriptions money. They want your subscription money too. You do realize gold selling is a multi-million dollar industry? You are not the only one buying gold. There would be plenty of false positives if they decided to go for buyers. There would be griefing too. Like I buy 100g and enter your character name, then watch you get banned for weeks. Enjoy your gold man you are safe.
---
Exactly. We're stuck with 2 shitty options, but I'd rather the game be healthier and deal with the neets screaming nochanges while doing something over just letting certain parts of the game die, ie pvp and community for one faction. 
---
Shit I'd rather have a time machine and fix blizzards incompetance from the start, but here we are
---
I've heard in vanilla you could do it but not classic
---
Think of it more as #AsFewChangesAsPossible rather than a #RehaulTheGame...
---
&gt;So your gonna ignore the beginning where Cenarius attacks lumber jack Peons out of nowhere and declared “Demon spawned wretches, you will all DIE!”
---
What? Of course he is attacking the people who are killing his people. He is talking about the invading orcs who just killed his people. I can see someone also seeing him referring to all orcs, but we can never know. Therefore, this isn't proof.
---
You're lack of response on Grom looking for a fight implies you don't have one. I bet if the NE would have asked him to stop he would have attacked them.
---
so no idea what's going on, how come everyone's transfering off from alliance?
---
Alliance Santa vs horde Santa
---
There is only one solution 
---
Enforce a max of 1:2 (massive) accounts on each side. 
---
1. Do not allow new accounts to create a character of the top faction on the server if above ratio of 2:1
---
2. Do not allow login a character on the server of the faction above 2:1 current logged in 
---
3. Open free migration to said server for bottom feeders
---
4. Open free migration from the said server for the top feeder.  
---
5. Open server merges by closing dead servers with one faction below 9:1 threshold.  
---
Count only active accounts (have played on that server within 14days and playtime was in total at least 1 hour). 
---
I expect to be downvoted to oblivion for this, but if they want to fix the whole dam thing then this is what it takes.
---
*Turn around and chase them as they pop mana citrines and eventually more Horde arrive to clean you up because its an open terrain conflict or you'd already be dead
---
The "people's server".
---
Yeah they must have changed it back. I've unsubbed twice. The first time in MoP and I dont remember if they asked and 2nd time was a couple months before classic. I know they werent asking then
---
Correct. You will not gain a rank as a casual pvp’r. This is why I (personally) don’t bother with world pvp. I like the battleground. The goal driven purpose of the battleground. The fight doesn’t stop because you gave up or it fizzled out; it ends when someone wins. You win or lose a battleground. Win it my friend!
---
Incedius!
---
Just open transfer to PVE servers and save what can be saved if classic has a future its clearly not going to be on PVP servers
---
Haha, what's snorting salt feel like?
---
That's a decent idea in theory. But it invalidates all the effort put into P1 and P2. And since you'll most likely be raiding MC still for legendaries and other pieces, the reset would cause people to re-farm DKP to take pieces that they should've had the DKP for already.
---
In practice, this is a horrible idea because it gives a huge incentive for people to leave the guild without regrets.
---
&gt; Dont forget to add Stormwind in
---
No alliance go to Stormwind unless Ony head is being dropped, but most people who maximize their professions hang out in TB / UC.
---
No. 
---
People need to calm down, wait for BGs before being an alarmist. It's just an echochamber at this point.
---
A server with a 20% population difference is 5 horde for every 4 alliance. If you think that's unplayable, you shouldn't have played on a PvP server. It's not Blizzard's fault, it's yours.
---
The problem is that Alliance discourage themselves.
---
No idea but if its anything like classic+ hard pass.
---
So the servers ruined, and they trying to what...? Ruin it more lol, I just don't understand....
---
Seriously, Blizzard should ban this loser.
---
I'm on Anathema, which is supposed to be Alliance dominated, yet I rarely see alliance kill squads. I can't go anywhere without being hunted by horde. I feel like a rabbit in a forest full of predators.
---
Oh it's just murder at this point.
---
&gt;*Its not like Blizzard hasnt invented faction transfers yet.*
---
They also have max-level boosts, race changes, vanity pets, mounts, wow tokens, etc.
---
Just because they have the option doesn't mean they need to implement it...
---
It’s 60 brother.
---
&gt;Make sense?
---
No, because you're making statements with authority and confidence that you simply have no data or real knowledge on, you're just pulling it out of your ass because you personally feel that way.
---
&gt; Plenty of people 
---
How many people? The majority, a plurality? Why would you even say that without any form of further data, it's meaningless.
---
&gt;  the vocal minority 
---
How do you know it's the vocal minority? What if they're the majority? What if the actual silent majority is quitting at rates faster than Reddit's "vocal minorty" is quitting?
---
&gt; want an experience *as close as possible to Vanilla given the limitations of the current situation* 
---
Then surely you're up in arms over mega-servers yes? Those are one of the largest departures from vanilla and bring the game far closer to retail, as community is less important when players are expendible due to the sheer quantity of players around.
---
It's fine if you're personally happy with the closest experience to vanilla possible. I understand wanting the vanilla spirit to be intact. But it isn't, we're facing problems that are very un-vanilla-like, Classic fails the vanilla purity test, and wanting no further changes because "Well at least these changes I'm fine with" makes very little sense when you consider the overall health of the game.
---
&gt; The population isn't fucked. The server is fine. Skeram is a very unique server.
---
It's unique if you compare it to Vanilla servers or the fact it's one of the least balanced population wise. Most people don't even log on unless it's raid day on alliance side because the imbalance isn't even worth trying to run a BRM instance for.
---
It was a completely foreseeable, genuinely vanilla, experience.
---
- honor system comes out
---
- but battlegrounds would only come months later
---
- so in the meantime alliance are farmed like trash
---
- to the point where hundreds of thousands of people abandon their level 60s on PvP servers, and start over with nothing on PvE.
---
Me, 2 years ago, in a thread about what classic will bring:
---
- https://np.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/7aplfj/i_hope_there_are_no_qualityoflife_improvements/dpc3nse/
---
&gt; Leveling through STV was bad; but tolerable.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt;&gt;I was 60 when it hit. We were farmed and camped endlessly. I wasn't paying $15 a month to stand in a graveyard all evening. There was no option but to leave. 
---
It will calm down once battlegrounds come out; and the horde can take out their frustrations in a battleground. Until then life is going to be miserable and the game will be unplayable.
---
- This is the authentic vanilla experience.  
---
- We all knew it was coming.
---
- \#NoChanges
---
He probably wasn't bullshitting. Hunters need mana too.
---
Oh no, a mistake! 
---
And again, a personal attack combined with a repetition.
---
Argumenting like a 5 year old.
---
But sure, keep blaming the people that play the gam within the rules and defend the company that can actually change something.
---
Woah, you're delusional. Streamers jumped on the Classic train after it was announced. What caused Blizzard to make Classic was pservers, mainly Nostalrius. Streaming pservers is forbidden on Twitch so streamers were avoiding talking about it like fire and also publicly condemning it.
---
No one sits in SW waiting for Ony head, people spam it in world and everyone groups for it then leaves. Where did you dream up this garbage at?
---
Multiboxing is only within the rules if it falls within their "one input, one action" policy. Any degree of automatization beyond that and it falls under "botting", which is bannable.
---
90% of what people refer to as multiboxing is NOT within the rules. You need to actually be playing each character, not have a series of programs coordinate the actions of 5 characters in perfect sync.
---
&gt; There are also more people in stormwind than IF. What is even the point of this video?
---
no.
---
But it’s not cheating...
---
that sort of behaviour that should result in permanent account closure
---
organize costume contests?
---
&gt; I sure do. I'm in one of the top 3 Alliance guilds and would be willing to wager my play time is among the highest on the server. This video is some propaganda shenanigans.
---
Lmao.
---
Tons of people have second accounts
---
I love PvP in WoW. It's a nice challenge to navigate a hostile world.
---
If you want balance roll a druid or wait for TBC Classic so you can do arenas...
---
I do care about the health of the game. But I would much prefer going up against players that can self-organize in a multiplayer game than ones that rally to forums begging the developers to fix it for them... If this game dies to people thinking they did but they didn't, so be it...
---
Id even agree to free faction changes.  Like set up so ”theres now 300 avaliable faction changes” 
---
Sucks for shamans and paladins tho.  Somethings gotta be done.
---
servers with faction imbalance will only get worse if that's available. more servers will die, more people will have to move, which can possibly screw over other servers(imagine if a thousand alliance swap to pve, then the server dies, then those three thousand+ horde go to other pvp servers, now those ratios are thrown off balance, and so on)
---
again, they should have gated at character creation on day one, but they didn't, now there's no real "fix"
---
I mean I can still create a character on a majority faction on servers that are heavily out balanced - making the problem worse. it's a mess and honestly blizz doesn't care, they think bg's will fix it but it won't
---
Old school runescape. It's a port of the game at the height of its popularity in 2007.
---
It's easy to see the problem and it's easy to think somebody, somewhere, should've implemented something to prevent it, but what is the solution? I entirely agree that faction balance is a huge problem, one that's going to get larger as time goes on, and that it therefore needs to be fixed, but viable solutions are far and few between. Incentivizing people to play Alliance is one of the better general ideas, but how do you practically do that? Cheaper subscription, faster leveling, more gold? Either way, those measures may very well be too little too late as there's a real cost to rerolling (unless free faction transfers are opened up).
---
Given how loudly people have been shouting about server communities, things like faction transfers are probably going to be unpopular. Paid or free, I can't see people taking it well when these things would invariably shatter these server communities people have grown to know for the last few months. Nonetheless, faction transfers is probably the one thing they can do right now (coupled with some small incentives for picking Alliance, don't know what), but it'll wreck a lot of what people really wanted out of Classic.
---
As for punishing the Horde, as opposed to incentivizing the Alliance, I don't see that working out well at all. Faction queues wouldn't solve the problem, it would just utterly cripple some people from playing the game (and in the case of some servers, a substantial portion of the population). Faction queues are another thing that might've worked on release, although I doubt it as people don't respect the queue enough to avoid playing with friends/on larger "safe" (in the context of potentially dying, that is) servers. Not only that but I don't see faction queues as a solution, I see it as problem replacement. If the problem is ultimately people being unable to enjoy the game due to faction imbalance, being entirely unable of playing the game due to faction imbalance still counts.
---
My personal favorite solution is layering. It's deeply unpopular, but it would allow Blizzard to manage the situation for the minority faction by creating a faction balanced layer for each server, and an overflow layer where people of the majority faction go to when the primary layer is full. It's the solution I see carrying the least negative direct impact on anybody, while allowing things to carry on mostly as normal for the minority faction (because plugging the bleed is important). I think biting the bullet and combining some servers on top of this, servers that are absurdly imbalanced, would go a long way towards plugging the bleed and making servers as a whole healthier.
---
Playing within the rules doesnt mean you're blamess for the current situation. Seems like your feeble mind cant comprehend that. 
---
&gt;Argumenting
---
Wtf is argumenting? Are you using random words now?
---
By masses and masses of horde. And alliance from the 3 alli dominated servers.
---
They’ll still have queues assuming most of the other realms have majority alliance. Flamelash will only make the queues longer for whatever realms they are matched up for pvp

---
Some tanks will pull while you're still drinking, this does NOT mean you need to stop drinking too if you still need mana. Keep drinking until the tank is at about 60% and then toss a heal. Maximizing your time drinking, as well as using big heals to stay effecient, utilizing mp5 as much as you can in fights; will help you have some longevity. Downrank as much as you can, whatever heals you can use at level while also being able to last a few fights without going oom, are the spells to use. Use hots for top offs, never a full heal, you'll waste mana doing full heals for top offs. Stop the group entirely to do buffs. I've had groups wipe because I asked to stop for re-up my fort on everyone, then got bitched at because I was oom and barely survived a pull. They take so much mana just buff, drink, continue. Just the easiest way.
---
It's an old vid for sure but probably the best rendition of it. The Ony explanation is so fitting it's incredible.
---
No real knowledge? Shit, I guess I *don't* read the comments here... Silly me and all those people with their fake opinions...
---
&gt;*How do you know it's the vocal minority?*
---
It's always a vocal minority. When the complaints are "x vs 1" groups are roaming/deathballing/steamrolling, it's the one person complaining vs. the x (the x generally &gt; 1 in the complaints). That shows a minority just by the numbers.
---
&gt;*Then surely you're up in arms over mega-servers yes?*
---
No. I chose not to roll on high pop due to wanting an experience closer to what there was 15 years ago and am having a blast with it currently.
---
&gt;*we're facing problems that are very un-vanilla-like*

Why are you using "we"? What is a vanilla-like problem? Where is *your* data?

&gt;*consider the overall health of the game*

Faction queue doesn't work, its been tried on TBC private servers, and it will single handely choke the server to death when 3/4th of the server will never be able to log in again.
---
The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory that describes a type of situation. It does not in any way shape or form deal with the rationality of the situation, it's merely a way of saying, "look, this is a thing that happens and here are some characteristics of it".
---
Some people for instance continue eating meat, even though they acknowledge the environmental harm it does and that it is immoral, simply because "it won't matter if I stop eating meat, the industry will go on". That too is a tragedy of the commons type situation. However it's very easy to demonstrate that one who thinks this way is commiting the paradox of voting fallacy, and that the tragedy of commons is not a guaranteed stalemate that leads to doom, by pointing out the increasing number of vegans globally.
---
Furthermore, with the way the honor system is setup, it simply does not make sense for most people to be doing what they're doing atm (grouping up into raids and camping FPs for hours on end) so it's wrong to even view this as a tragedy of the commons type situation really, as for most people this isn't an issue of resources, but simply game knowledge.
---
I don’t trust blizzard with making new content for classic. They can’t even handle the existing content
---
Anduin used rez in the BfA cinematic. I agree with your post but that was one point on canon where you were wrong.
---
I’m 60 horde on a horde dominate server and I cancelled my sub. It’s just not fun anymore. During phase 1 the player base was so much more mellow. Everyone willing to help each other out with quests and lvling and running dungeons farming prebis. PvP was fun because it was meaningless nobody was getting but hurt about getting ganked. You just resd and try to get them back or moved on. If somebody was camping you people were more likely to help because it was really just for the fun of it.  Phase 2 is just gank squads and raid logging. the game losses a lot of the appeal when the player base is asked to be shitty to each other.
---
If it's 3-man groups then surely you just need to find two more players to even it out for you, no?
---
Anyone who spells Cruelty that way does indeed raise some red flags
---
Got it. I don't use face much but I guess I should. And should I also get a threat meter?
---
Given the current situation it would probably no longer upset that many people, except for the people deriving happiness or pleasure from ganking. 
---
Makes you kinda wonder why blizz is so adamant about not releasing battlegrounds now, even tho they see what the situation is. They kinda screwed up there by not reacting to this.
---
you can add people through the battle.net friendslist regardless of their faction when you right click their portrait in-game.

It doesn't matter if they should or shouldn't you absolute fucking mongoloid, it's the internet, people ARE GONNA be assholes.

Humanity is a toxic cesspool that needs needs a big boogeyman to behave (proof: every god damn religion anywhere, ever) and the internet reflects that in the most obvious way

If you really think the community could regulate this problem, while at the same time hundreds die every day cos pairs of morons couldn't figure out who should accelerate their car first in an intersection that has no stop signs, there's something fundamentally wrong with the way you think.

Nothing will happen if you don’t tell anyone. Blizzard is far to busy. I’ve given some RL mates some gold for their mounts. Not banned obviously.

However, how would anyone know that they didn’t transfer me some $ or something.

Thank you! :D the downranking part is something I'm yet to discover. Since I'm still low lvl, didn't feel the need to downrank yet. But I'll remember it when the time comes. Good game to you as well!

You have the mentality of a small child. "No one forced me to stop so I had no choice but to keep doing it!"

Here's a fucking hint: maybe keep your dick in your pants and just wait for BGs. You're never gonna be a High Warlord. 99% of players won't even sniff R14. All you did was kill servers so you could get your easy PvP gear a week earlier.
---
I remeber EPL being harder to gank in because of guards. Did something change?
---
This is the kind of shit that makes rolling Horde unplayable. Seriously lunatics fill horde on all realms. Alliance would never.
---
Yeah the idiots lost the 7v3 fucking terribads. A real checkmate by Horde; giving the Alliance only half the pieces the Horde had to start the game by Blizzard's poor design.
---
Yeah I was down there to pick up my quintessence earlier today. Him, 2 priests and a warrior were just camping the FP using Mind Control to wait out the honorless debuff
---
Battle shout is a warriors best AoE threat generator in classic. Spam it
---
To be fair, that's 3 horde for every 2 alliance. Not 5 for 4.
---
Everybody wanna lock dominant faction creating new characters until they realize that would prevent large amounts of people from playing with their friends and guilds.
---
I'm glad Blizhard doesn't listen to a lot of you.
---
It's bizarre to me that people speak about CRBG's like we're getting Vanilla-esque battlegroups even though Blizzard has given zero indication that we are.
---
It's going to work exactly like it does on Modern WoW.
---
Ahhahah this is hilarious especially the suicide hotline spam
---
 Boomers mad
---
You’re dreaming if you think blizzard is going to have a polling system like OSRS. But classic+ is pretty likely, depending on how healthy the game is at that point. Blizzard will have to see how many subs they have at the end of phase 6 and decide if it’s worth developing new content for those still subscribed.
---
If the only thing keeping pvp servers alive is sunk cost fallacy, they should die.
---
But for warrior.
---
Find another guild 🤷‍♀️
---
From what I'm getting here this guy was on the winning side of your scuffle?
---
So here he's being a sore winner? I don't understand people like that. Why does he play? What aspect of this game brings him joy?

He just had a situation where the odds were against him and he came out on top and he still has to complain about it?
---
This is a person who will probably never know happiness.

It’s the standard liberal hero narrative. Excise the deviant authority figure, preserve the sanctity of the unimpeachable system.  DO NOT QUESTION THE SYSTEM.
---
&gt; For PVP Arms: Is spamming improved hamstring attempting to get the immobilization effect a worthwhile tactic?
---
No, because most targets with Hamstring on them can't move away from you fast enough to avoid melee. ie, their slows/snares are 40-50%.
---
If you have spare rage and can't WW or MS, you sunder armor to increase dmg output for cheap. Against clothies, 1 sunder makes them naked.

Asking for friends brother
---
Complain about getting ganked and being unable to PvE at all. "pvp happening on a pvp server". Complain about PvP literally being exstinct. "But, there's PvE. You remember that right? Cause vanilla wow is, by a pretty large margin, a PvE focused game by design. You remember. God, you're salty."
---
Do you guys read the shit you guys are saying? Like you may not have said it, but you sure are dumb for not realizing the comments around you and how this particular one makes you look just so dense.
---
never had that option :S
---
Drop group and rejoin fixed mine
---
Same
---
Yes. PvE players are the real winners. I begged my friends to play on a PvE server and they wouldn't listen. Now here we are. None of us play anymore.
---
Probably a relic of the fact this is not on the vanilla engine.
---
Classic is vanilla on the modern WoW engine.
---
It's probably harder to take that function out than to leave it in.
---
Just saying,  it's not a perfect solution and will probably screw over more servers. Not saying we shouldn't have that option but it would be better to have some limitations so it's not just a flood of people server hopping and ruining other servers
---
Any macros you can share?
---
Nah I'm doing good raidlogging over here on Whitemane. 
---
Your inability to fathom that you can partake in a bad system without being a total douchebag is simply baffling, as is your failure to comprehend that behaving badly within the parameters laid out by Blizzard does not absolve either party but instead spreads the blame around.
---
You'll never make Grand Marshal by the way.

At this point posts like these have to be trolls
---
All 10 of the top 10 US and EU PvP servers have significant faction imbalance problems (most 60/40 or worse)
---
19 of these top 20 servers are horde dominated with heartseeker being the only exception.
---
Server merges wont work. Realm transfers wont work.There are not enough balanced/ally favored servers to balance all of these servers out, there are just quite simply not enough alliance.
---
Opening up realm transfers will exacerbate an already bad problem into something truly awful. Nobody in appreciable numbers is willing to transfer to a server where their faction is dominated, it will just cause people that are stuck as the minority faction on 70/30 realms to transfer off to one of their safe havens
---
60/40=1.5
---
It's a 50% population difference. For every 1 of the underpopulated side there are 1.5 of the overpopulated side.
---
Blizzard should just have forced a 50/50 ratio between factions.  
---
If there are too many horde's on a server, the next number of players can only make alliance until it has evened out.
---
All of thise just proved that wow-players can't handle freedom without abusing it, so they need to be held in a leash and get told what to do, to get the most balanced experience.
---
I think this is what was going on on each person’s side of the conversation.
---
Buyer: price ? (Buyer asks for the price)
---
Seller: 21/stack (Meant to say 2.1g/stack)
---
Buyer: u mean 2. 1 g ? (Corrects seller)
---
Seller: yes (Acknowledges the buyer’s proposed correction is indeed, correct)
---
Buyer: how many stacks u have ? (Buyer wants to know how many stacks are available for purchase)
---
Seller: 60 (Seller means to type 6 stacks)
---
Seller: 6 stacks* (Seller corrects it to 6 stacks)
---
Buyer: cod me 10 (Doesn’t see the actual number of available stacks before he sends this message asking for 10 stacks, therefore ordering more than the seller has. This is where the confusion in earnest begins)
---
Seller: 1 stack? (Seller now believes buyer has made a typo since he has told the buyer that they only have 6 stacks. In reality the buyer did not make a typo, but is responding to the incorrect knowledge that there are 60 stacks available for purchase)
---
Buyer: 10 stacks (the buyer is now trying to correct the seller, thinking that either the seller 1. Made a typo and meant to send 10 stacks or 2. Is clarifying he wants 10 stacks and not 10 items. The buyer does both of these within this one sentence whether or not they are aware of its impact)
---
Seller: i only have 6 stacks (clarifying for a second time that only 6 stacks are available for purchase)
---
Seller: you mean 100 or 10 (now trying to figure out if this whole stack method of counting items should be thrown out the window, and if counting out the actual amount of the item that is available for purchase will clear up the confusion that has spiraled out of their hands. This is done to further clarify exactly what is to be purchased. The seller is also at the same time trying to figure out if the buyer was asking for an item amount, or a stack amount. Figuring going back to gold ol’ fashion counting of an item will be more than understandable. 
---
Buyer: i mean 10 (May chaos reign supreme)
---
Do they do something? Gonna have to test it ty!
---
I've said it a million times. The amount of joy I get from winning a fair 1v1 is not nearly enough for me to put up with the absolute frustration of dying to an Xv1 potentially dozens of times. I don't like grouping up and ruining other peoples day by just killing people who can't fight back. I enjoyed Arenas and BGs, but world PvP was and always will be fucking stupid and not fun at all. Even if I did enjoy world PvP, it doesn't mean I would want it to be 100% of the game.
---
It's not 25 min queues, the ratio above 60:40 on pservers typically had hour long bg queues.
---
People think cross realm BG will solve it but no way, add up all the pvp realms and the population is still very high H:A ratio.
---
We need FACTION transfers ASAP for those on high Horde server the opportunity for the community and players to solve the problem themselves. 
---
I for one would switch my chars to Alliance if given the option because I hate long BG queues.
---
awesome!

Im working this weekend but going to play for 10days straight from monday. Ill may be asking you some questions later this week.

The thing no one ever mentions about playing a hunter in pvp is that you shouldnt keep your pet out unless you're fighting. If you dont have a pet out mage novas you then you can summon your pet and it wont be nova'd.
---
Just don’t be a fucking idiot man. If your friend bought 10k gold all at once, then yea he’s probably gonna get banned. If you take a bunch of money from him you’ll probably get banned too. If he bought like 300g then he’s probably totally fine and youll be fine too. Just don’t be a moron about it and you won’t get banned. Blizzard would like to keep your $15, they don’t give a shit if someone gave you a few hundred gold no matter where it came from.
---
Hunter doing optimal rotation run out of mana pretty quick and don’t have much gear that helps it. For MC at this point the runes are most likely not needed since fights are so quick but come progressing in bwl/aq/Naxxramas they will be very useful for hunters too.
---
Well yeah.  It's an entire server of sheep 15 year olds who think they're hardcore.

I thought you were linking him the suicide prevention number because he looked like he needed it honestly. He's probably projecting a lot then if he's trying to say that shit to others.
---
...is terrible
---
I actually am starting to think that if I had just rolled horde on a dominant server I would actually be having the best time. I hate world PvP, I want to stomp in it and just never get the downside of dying to it. And the end result would be a PvE server which I wanted to play on all along. I don't know what anyone wants to be done. Blizzard not implementing anything to prevent this or subdue the damage tells me everything I needed to know about their thoughts on Classic. They don't care and want us all to just realize we enjoyed part of WoW, and we should just play retail. I was enjoying Classic so much I honestly thought about trying retail, I couldn't get enough of it. Now I want nothing to do with either. So, well played Blizzard, you did it. 
---
WCIII reforged is the last saving grace for them before I probably quit playing all their games for good. It was a fantastic 20+ years of playing their games, but all good things have to end I guess.

If TBC gets released, game is unhealthy and dying just trying to milk out it’s last remaining subs and anyone who will come back for TBC.

If classic+ gets released, game is doing great tons of subs worth developing brand new content for.

Buyer: you mean 2.1g? (Per item)
---
Seller: yes
---
Buyer: how many stacks do you have?
---
Seller: I have 60x of the item (misread)
---
Seller: I have 6 stacks (corrected)
---
Buyer: cod me 10 ( of the item)
---
Seller: you want me to cod you 1 stack? (10 of the item)
---
Buyer: 10 (of the item, 1) stack
---
Seller: I only have 6 stacks (6x10 of the item)
---
Seller: by “10 stack” do you mean 1 stack of 10 or do you mean 10 stacks of 10?
---
Buyer: I mean 1 stack of 10
---
basically: dumb plot way to add the forsaken as not only a playable race but to the horde.
---
In reality if it were a new expansion to wc3 after tft OR wc4 the forsaken would've been wiped out after Arthas by (most likely) stormwind who would've had Varian back by then.
---
You get almost no honor after 4 kills and zero honor after 5.
---
Where others progressed, a few among us stayed at the mental capacity of a 8 year old.
---
It was 60. Now it’s 45-75
---
Then buy a stock of your vials at those vendors and your problem is solved.
---
I don't use it as an excuse though. I'm saying it was easy to guess it and easy to avoid it, but nothing happened. And you can't put the blame on the masses, not entirely. The truth is both parties are suffering the cosnequences of their actions right now, the point is one party is a paying customer for a service and the other a service provider to a huge mass. Who has the responsibility to predict the failures and do something about them?
---
In your analogy, sure, both the drivers and the city is to blame. But if accidents happen in said intersection daily, when does the time come for everybody to realise that this is not sustainable?
---
And what do we do with people like /u/DingyWarehouse screaming "if only you let the other driver go first, where is your compassion? you don't need stop signs if you just have a little heart!" every chance they get? Actual enablers of a sad all around situation?
---
In essence, my point is that this whole thing is not about assigning blame. It's about FIXING IT. Pointing the finger at people who played the game the way they were allowed is gonna do absolutely nothing other than cause you to have answers like "go to retail", "pvp on a pvp server".
---
Thikn of this hypothetical: If the people camping Gadgetzan rooftops weren't getting warned then banned, do you think they'd ever stop? They would have failed to take under consideration other people and the entity that was supposed to regulate them would have failed to stop them. Would they ever stop?
---
If you do, still plenty PvP going on on PvE servers SS Vs TM is in almost 24/7 and I regularly see alliance in org. But, I can opt out, which is fine because I personally don't like it.
---
Originally I thought you were just whinny, but now your whiny with a point. Good job self reflecting. And I do understand the Blatant repetition.
---
As a Dota player, you just gotta 5 stack with friends, ensures no toxicity in your team.
---
Then your goofy ass should have rolled PvE. You have no ground to stand on here. Literally everything you have said is poorly thought out and counts on others playing your way.
---
Horde being friendly on a PvP server? Please sir spare me your sweet sweet lies.
---
I'm not sure cross realm will make that much difference. The Alliance I know haven't quit for alliance on another server, they've quit for other games. I'm not even sure if I'm going to return myself at this point because my guild and community I played with has been completely decimated. I haven't had any incentive to log on for weeks, which is a shame because I was really looking forward to classic.
---
However, I was looking forward to it for the community and playing with friends once again. A handful have found a new guild, another handful have rerolled Horde, but most picked up new games in the sales and don't seem likely to return.
---
Yes get it for OH it price MH white hits- with a Deathbringer it fucks
---
You can just flag yourself as PvP and then there's plenty dangers.
---
Just 2h fury prot tank then...
---
I was talking about people hating gnomes which doesn’t 100% relate to OP but yeah I guess.
---
Not even a question.... DB
---
I didn’t make the case that I shouldn’t be typing. So I’m not going against my own words. You did lmao.
---
Stop sending level 44s with basic questions to FC to be ripped to shreds
---
yeah, uh, not really, because this is a game that you choose to play and a prison is a place you are confined to against your will
---
not.. really close at all
---
Flurry is offhand bis until either DW DB’s and then Krolkorush off Nef as OH
---
No relics until phase 5 unfortunately :(
---
Egans Blaster BIS until then
---
Duel DB or Krolkorush
---
I mean, presumably she wasn't super evil when she was Ranger General of Quel'Thalas :P
---
But more seriously I think people don't mind that she's super evil, but rather that she's a smug character that's been on a winning streak and the focus of most of the latest lore. When a smug character who keeps winning without struggling at all is thrust in your face for so long, people tend to get irritated.
---
I hope you find your own Guano to make you see the light
---
&gt;  put down that can of lead paint
---
you mean the thing you call your skull?
---
Nobody in their right mind would get in some strangers face and start spewing stuff like this in real life.
---
And yet here we are, where it happens behind keyboards all too often
---
&gt;People have the option to reroll or quit if they aren't happy with the server they are on.
---
You also have the option to go on a private server if you want a 100% vanilla experience because Classic isn't it. Classic is vanilla with concessions for a more robust gameplay experience, and the only thing we're doing at this point is negotiating how far those concessions should go.
---
The rest of your post is idle victim blaming
---
Which one?
---
They both sound like shitholes in that pic...
---
In the world chat on horde side everyone was just so toxic to anyone who was transferring and refusing to accept the server is dead. They just kept saying "bgs will fix everything stop crying". I managed to transfer 2 of my characters off of there to earthshaker but was going to wait a few days to see how it was before moving my others.. turns out they cancled all transfers now i had no idea.
---
Rogue at any bracket is solid. At 39 bracket hunts get a couple weapons plus you'll have aimed shot, scatter, barrage, etc. Those are my top 2
---
Find a guild 🤷‍♀️
---
Few months later and you’re still right
---
It’s actually just a randomly generated reddit name. This incident occurred on Shazzrah EU
---
For a lot of people wow is about competition and getting the gear before others. Server first Benediction is cool but once Orgrimmar has 20 priests wielding it at all times the glory is gone.
---
That Pss Rogue is such an idiot omg
---
I honestly can't believe that Vulpera and Mechagnomes are a thing but playable Murlocs aren't.
---
Nah, they cant switch. Problem solved. Life isnt always fair :P
---
Yea I felt like rouge would def be a safe bet, along with both being pretty easy to level too. Thanks
---
+ cap servers at 6k per factions and force a queue after that point
---
He sounds like he has a happy home life.
---
You have to hit it.
---
I set mine to OG. That one evening in the week I can actually manage to fly to Blackrock before the raid starts...
---
No, it’s because growl doesn’t do damage. Open up your combat log and learn how to use it if you want to be able to check. Or, just use your threat meter to watch for threat spikes from the pet. Regardless, you’ll know by feel eventually

&gt; 90% of what people refer to as multiboxing is NOT within the rules. You need to actually be playing each character, not have a series of programs coordinate the actions of 5 characters in perfect sync.
---
I'm curious, how wouly "actually be playing" look like? Running from one keyboard to another?
---
Duplicating your keystrokes is within the rules and exactly how multiboxing works, and afaik most multiboxers play exactly like this.
---
Ok koo ty!
---
Its what it is, grow a pair damn retail gone and made you weeeeeeeeak!
---
They suck dooeeeck
---
that as well.
---
The major point being:
---
If players time and time again prove they can't be trusted with handling the slightest hint of freedom without fucking over the entire game, they shouldn't be granted that freedom, unless it is a single-player game.
---
Issue is the cat's out of the bag. Can't make other faction toons on pvp servers so you would basically be delegated to basing it on how many opposing faction are online at that moment to even it - effectively cutting off access from most horde players. No skin off my back, but dont think they'd like it
---
I see, is exalted rep difficult to obtain?
---
Calling your (presumably deliberate at this point) failure to comprehend a concept baffling isn't a personal attack. Its a statement of fact.
---
Anyways, as the other guy has told you: you're free to do whatever you want. People took a bad system to its most logical outcome which ended up making the game unplayable for so many people, droves of them have quit or left their realms. I sincerely hope the honor gain was worth it. Again, there were consequences for your actions. People are not obligated to pay money each month for you to continue your honor grind at the expense of their time and money.
---
The obvious solution was to try \*not\* to take it to that conclusion by exercising a degree of restraint. At no point did you consider that the behavior going on might impact the health of the game? It seems like you did and simply didn't care. You could have shown restraint, but instead you had to be rank 6 instead of 4 before BGs came out. People on Reddit, the forums and in game were very vocal about the long term damage it would do.
---
Its a rather unavoidable conclusion that you simply now want to pass the blame solely to Blizzard for making a bad system instead of accepting even a single shred of responsibility for the things you went out and personally did. There were ample warnings. You simply chose to keep going because at the end of the day, your attitude was "me first" and now that the consequences are becoming visible, you're resorting to the childlike mindset that if what you did was really bad, an adult should have stopped you.
---
I would be shocked if blizzard does anything good with classic. If anything they will add in p2w and micro transactions.
---
All lower level zones have actually been pretty peaceful since honour came out as it’s a waste of time for 60s to gank there.
---
Mass res
---
I agree with the other poster here, not really a good idea IMO.  If you've attended every raid and been lucky enough to get every drop you need in MC and STILL are showing up to raids, why shouldnt you get first dibs on BWL gear?
---
Setting some type of decay or maximum allowable DKP might be a better way to approach this but reducing everyones DKP completely diminishes the effort people put into making it to raids and being prepared.
---
If you're ugly, it will attack you. Us gnomes are very vulnerable
---
I'd rather play on an imbalancer server than on a PvE server. PvE servers are antithecal to Classic gameplay.
---
The only reason PvE servers look better right now is because Blizzard are literally ruining some of the PvP servers by increasing player cap, opening up transfers and then closing them.
---
Now I'm curious, what's this about?
---
fuck what they like.
---
If the player-base can't handle freedom without fucking over the game, which is a multiplayer experience and thus affects everyone, they shouldn't be allowed the freedom.
---
If they want a game where they are allowed to do everything, there are hundreds of single-player games.
---
??? lvl 48 is precisely the level at which players start granting honor to level 60s. In the existing system that's precisely when players stop being "lowbies" as far as the honor system is concerned.
---
But they did do it at least on flamelash. Facts are facts and you can't just "nope" them .
---
They only engage if the person attacked is exalted with argent dawn.
---
Since you are clearly incapable of reading, I once again repeat that I never said nothing should be done. You just assumed that because you came up with a stupid point and don't want to admit you were wrong, so you're just doubling down.
---
Classic horde player tbh.
---
They've already sunk the time into leveling once and don't want to sink the time into it again. Sunk cost.
---
66:33 is bad yes but if they enforced it at that point at least 33% of the players are of your faction.
---
The original took me like 4 complete reads to figure this out.
---
Ok whatever, you actually don't understand what you're saying, but that's fine
---
Gotta give probs to horde for literally killing their own server. Enjoy your RP-coop server :-)
---
An asshole
---
Last alliance leaving the server, 2019, colourised
---
I find it best just to uninstall the game, Problem solved.
---
I just wish to balance the realms in faction imbalance if we could get some of the alliance off pve realms to pvp realms I’m personally for it but that just me personally.  I can totally understand your standpoint and will not argue against it as it can creat bad habits.
---
Watch as unresponsible players comes to comment about it is blizzard's fault for them going overboard and having no self-control.
---
Why do you dodge the simple question like crazy? Name me a realm which isn't a target of several blizzard warnings "OVERCROWDED PLEASE TRANSFER". Why is it so hard for you?
---
Then just farm DMT for a bit m8
---
People need breaks ya, but the game is genuinely fun with friends, the satisfying moments out way the bad ones.
---
"Dad? You're supposed to be at work"
---
Getting dunked on by a premade in WSG/AV is enjoying the game?
---
Worth 3% hit on the raid bosses, which only applies to MT. Also worth the reduced glancing chance, but again that pretty much applies to only MT. On any non-63 mob, the hit is minor (&lt;1%) and the glancing is significantly less.
---
Haven’t crunched the numbers myself, but on 60/61/62 mobs, I guess it works out quite better for the claw.
---
I've played Dota 2 since 2011 and DotA before that. One of the things I learned over the years is to *immediately* mute people who show signs of toxicity. It's a very simple and effective solution. Just mute it.
---
I am levelling a warrior and passing mages constantly give me int. Thanks I guess, faster wep skillups.
---
It's double the work, but keep separate dkp's for bwl and mc/ony
---
I just logged in at 2:53AM and counted 24 alliance from the sw bank to the AH.  Way more in IF getting free honor from the rogues who instantly die when they spawn.  I don't understand what you get put of lying about the server pop.  My only thoughts are you keep dying to horde and are trying to justify your inability to pvp by using these made up population numbers.
---
And it's not like rank rewards are that good, sure a few classes got a few good purples there, but the majority are meh. And the mount is like an indication that you camped opposite faction for a few weeks, and camping was never an honorable thing to do in games...
---
I normally sell herbs myself but only when I see them going for p high prices, stuff like swiftthistle, grave moss, mtn silversage, dreamfoil, and wild steelbloom have all made me solid $ on the right day. There are some pots that will sell for quite a bit more than the cost of making but for the most part I find the least amount of risk in selling the herbs, but that’s just me.
---
No, nameplates is just the name of the feature. You don’t need an addon. Just add the weakaura. I’ll link, one sec
---
I mean its both right? We suck + blizz was stupid in how large they made servers (largely because they under estimated how many people would no life the game)
---
Pretty much the only way to have actual classic like pvp servers to to bring back the original pop caps so about 2k max
---
The forsaken are not evil.  They cannot reproduce and Sylvanis is using the means at her disposal to ensure that her race of people who rely on her for their survival and protection are able to continue their existence.  If the Alliance were not trying to constantly purge them from existence and did not turn their back on their friends and family who had died, been risen by Arthas, and then freed from servitude by Sylvanis, then they would not have to be alone in their own neck of the wood.
---
Furthermore, there is nothing more karmatic than to turn your enemies into what they hate most, and in the process, being forced to become your friend and ally to maintain the ability for them to exist.
---
Also, if you dig a bit deeper into the lore, you will see that Warcraft ethics are closely tied to  the D&amp;D planar system.  Undead are actually entities that have surpassed the constraint of the 9 planes.  They were alive (light plane) then they were dead (death plane) but now they are undead. You can see this in some of the more recent trailers where Sylvanis harnesses new magic that is a combination of both light and death energy.  The undead are really a more advanced stage of life, with the potential to be on par with the Naaru, the Titans, and the Wild Gods.  
---
Sylvanis herself has advanced past being an undead into being a shade that still has control of her physical form. You can see this in the trailer when she insta-gibs a bunch of soldiers by just touching them in her shadow form. 
---
TLDR: The Forsaken are a superior form of life and have the potential to become demi gods.
---
These alt accounts would be trying to rank on their own since barely any competition. And obviously put up for sale later.
---
Sounds like alliance on razorgore.
---
judging by the screenshot ur camping the ashara FP, don't condone what hes saying but FP campers deserve all the flak they get
---
Keep killing your servers you brain
---
Honestly... yes? The afterlife's an established thing in this universe, with ample enough proof that people of all races and factions are aware of it. It seems like the Forsaken should want to die in battle while slaying hordes of scourge, freeing as many spirits as possible to reunite with their loved ones in the afterlife. Undeath, *any* undeath - Scourge and Forsaken alike - inevitably twists the spirit. Taking up blade and spell against Arthas' legions is the highest calling for any Forsaken genuinely looking to do good.
---
tOxiC AnD DiSguStIng!
---
Just add to ignore and stop contributing.
---
Oh yeah its real fun having the adc cry because he shoves his lane and gets ganked so they throw a fit and int feed or afk.
---
Add faction queue.  If your faction queue is above (#) you're offered a free transfer to select servers.
---
Classic already has horrible scaling as the game progresses. Things like weapon damage jump several fold while health scaling doesn't. PvP post AQ kill time drops to two or three globals. Adding more content with more gear is a terrible idea.
---
TBC remastered would be cool with some tweaks but Classic plus would be crap.
---
This is a god awful example. Even on Bigglesworth which has a horde majority, walking around flagged in a UC/Org is always liable to get you killed by a rogue.
---
There is also no reason for you to be flagged as a level 1 in the first place. gr8 b8 m8
---
I was talking in world chat on flamelash horde and everyone was just toxic as hell to anyone mentioning the server being dead and horde being to blame. Multiple players kept saying bgs will fix it all and stop crying. I have always been a huge horde fan i rolled an alliance on another server recently and stopped playing it due to being farmed at BRD. Came back to Flamelash to play my horde characters and now this it does seem like every step of the way i have been blocked by something in this game...
---
Well, mute them lol. As I said, I just play with friends now, much more enjoyable.
---

Your decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.
---
If you have some notion of value in the items and gear you've collected. You are discounting the fun you had in gathering the items/gear and assuming future fun/gain based upon your already collected possessions.

---
Jokes aside, good luck
---
God you’re the first person who makes any sense ever since the masses started crying out for faction queues weeks ago.
---
Theres litteraly nothing wrong with the game. Its just that people play the game way different then before right now which doesnt please most casuals since they’re getting farmed by all elitist honor farm dudes. Bgs will change things quite a bit since most of the decent pvpers will not be roaming around anymore in the open world for kills. Most people you will encounter will most likely be doing pve content or are farming gold.
---
Post your findings to the Fight Club discord.
---
We all understand that, you just dont understand numbers.
---
Have a good day in the dummyville.
---
your build lacks 15% TPS automatically because no points in prot. and no sword spec/1 flurry is not better than fury prot. Flurry alone is better than anything in arms talent tree together for dps.
---
Exactly, it's a punishment for people who aren't the ones causing grief to other players.
---
There might be lots of solutions to consider, but faction queues are not one. Honestly though, I don't think there is one. This is just what classic wow is. There is a reason PvP titles were reworked to be received from rated battlegrounds... because the old system was flawed. And now it's back.
---
But muh resto druid!
---
You guys are both right, and it's a shame that you can't see it.
---
- The orcs couldn't have known that night elf forests are more sapient than trees elsewhere, so they should not be blamed for chopping them down when they desperately needed the resources to defend themselves from multiple aggressors in Kalimdor.
---
- The night elves cannot be blamed for defending their wisps and ancients from alien invaders that still yet reeked of demonic influence, given their history with the Legion.
---
Both sides should have taken more time, sought greater understanding. Both sides didn't, for *perfectly sensible reasons.* And both sides suffered for it, with the elves losing a god and the orcs falling back into demonic possession. That's the point of it all - it's a tragedy on both sides.
---
I'd love to see you run a business.
---
Into the ground.
---
unstable guy
---
Alliance character looks like Kripparrian
---
Well the same thing happened here whether it's aprison, experiment or whatever. After 6 days people started rerolling on PvE and doing character transfers, effectively quitting the experiment.
---
PvE is easy. People want to farm gear to gank lowbies.
---
Fucking kek. The entire game is easy, especially killing lowbies.
---
I imagine you’re too young to remember the Blood Elf males upon their release. Or your a filthy alliance mongrel and your opinions have less value than that of boar.
---
I like to share the source of a meme when I redraw it because that's 99% of my content :P
---
Besides, more people need to know about the [OG weeb bromance](https://youtu.be/rQzFz6r074o?t=39)
---
Good fucking point.
---
The servers were fucked from the start because they refused to spend more money on the project because they thought it would be a flop. They then caused people to leave because of that. And then opened more servers for people to transfer to which then died lol.
---
If you're gonna hold the mains of alliance players hostage on pvp servers they're more likely to quit or reroll instead of sticking around
---
No, another guy became the Lich King, a guy to basically is just there to contain the Lich King power.
---
It’s really stupid.
---
I like how this is just censored text of one person. Nice made up narrative.
---
At what point did spewing types of fallacy become the pseudo intellectual calling card?
---
If you're gonna do that, at least get it right. This has absolutely nothing to do with sunken cost, dingus.
---
My guy you clearly dont understand whats going on.
---
Not everyone has the time or interest in rerolling, with the amount of different games we have these days. Nobody needs to just play wow.
---
And how you have figured out that it isnt just about ganking is beyond me, it was literally impossible to enter DM as Alliance on Mograine last night.
---
Every single member of our party died instantly where they rezzed and the grp just died because you cant do anything in the world.
---
How do you miss the shitshow thats been going on in the subreddit by this much is strange.
---
Because if you don't let people that don't want to be on the server off, they will be forced to reroll. A lot of people would rather quit than reroll. No one is going to go "welp I'm stuck here getting farmed, nothing I can do about it." They'll just quit because they aren't having fun and it's a game. It's supposed to be fun, not people doing their duty to help maintain even server populations.
---
I'm not excusing the players in any case whatsoever. Personally, I was one of the few scolding my guildmates for farming allies 24/7, urging global chats to not form 40 man raids to take down a 5man group roaming plaguelands, even had a falling out with a real life friend during a lan session when he'd constantly deviate from our route to UBRS to farm lvl48 people lvling in the gorge.
---
I failed. Spectacularly. Nobody would listen, the dopamine hit of &lt;HK! +200 honor&gt; is way stronger than my voice or any other person's voice. 
---
It reached the point that I haven't logged in in 10 days. I'm a first time wow player, coming from other MMOs with equal or even bigger importance in PvP (L2, GW2, AION) etc. The situation is making me honestly dread logging in. 
---
I understand that the players are responsible for the problem. I don't expect them to become the solution to it, though. That would never happen, that has never happened in the history of humanity, lol. I only expect them to try to (unwillingly) make the problem even worse on their (willing) attempt to even further maximise their honor gain per hour. 
---
If I, as a first timer, was full preraid bis on a warlock and a warrior and prety much only look forward to 2 hours per week in  MC with my guild mates and have else to do, I can only imagine how someone who's been doing this for 15 years feels. The metagame in MMOs has changed. They're mainly loot pinatas nowadays. Tunnelvisioned on goals and how to meet them with the absolute smallest investment of time possible. Obviously the problem lies with them, the fact that they do nothing else etc etc etc. But is this a good enough excuse for the lack of action presented to us by the governing body?
---
So what would you recommend
---
Why would you not just ignore/block/mute him?
---
Why would BGs change anything?   Do you think level 60 geared undead rogues are ganking because they wanted fair battles against alliance that are geared, specced, and know they're in a fight?
---
So two voluntary populations aren't comparable because one of them is supposed to represent an involuntary population?
---
You're an idiot.
---
Ah yes. Understandable. And indeed. Some good bromance never hurt anyone ;). I checked some of your other works, btw. They be nice.
---
I think it's just gold once you get the rep.
---
Do yourself a favor and don't Google it. Life is better without knowing
---
I've had 60s on PvE and PvP servers, and i'm currently Alliance on a 60/40 H:A server, so it's not like I don't understand the issue.
---
How is a PvE server not antithecal to world bosses for example? To the opening of the AQ gates? To the farming of open world resources?
---
Instead of treating PvP servers like a lost cause, Blizzard could actually fix them. I'm so against just saying that they're unfixable and lets just completely kill them by opening up more transfers.
---
Like you make realms with like 3x the cap of a normal vanilla realm, start opening up free transfers off the server, server starts to become extremely unbalanced (before that almost all servers were more like 55/45 or 60/40 at the worst), and now you want to let the remaining people go to a PvE server?
---
Okay but having noone to pvp isn't the goal
---
Wrong person to reply to that was meant for the other person :)
---
thing is: Blizzard's only mistake was building a flawed system and trusting players to have a sense of honor.
---
players were not forced to push the system to it's limit, to abuse it and camp every important spot for the other faction in the entire game. They chose to do this of their own free will to get as much personal gain as possible.
---
You can still catch up, just don't go on a PvP server.
---
No fucking shit, it was an experiment. Obviously it wasn't a real prison. But the game isn't real either. They're both simulations. One simulates a place where your very presence is predicated on punishment and the system explicitly establishes a power hierarchy. 
---
There is no such hierarchy in WoW. The perceived "power" of the dominant faction is not derived from the system itself but from population imbalance as a consequence of Blizzard's decision-making. The reasons someone would choose to play WoW vs. choose to volunteer for a punitive experiment are entirely different making comparisons pointless. 
---
This is why nobody takes social sciences seriously, because the "science" part is generally missing. The stanford prison experiment is kind of a joke.
---
&gt;*also him leaving as a solution makes the problem even worse*
---
Fuck that. Good riddance to people with the mentality of *complain until we get the game changed*... That's how we got to retail.

It's pretty disgusting that the system was implemented the first time round. How can did blizzard justify a system that encourages players to play so mamy hours a day. It's not healthy.
---
People don't seem to understand just how many fucking Horde there are. I'm not sure why, we have fairly solid data. I guess they just don't research it.
---
Between the massive overpopulation of Horde and the fact that most won't transfer from their positions of power to the handful of realms Alliance are dominant on, its starting to look more and more like an unfixable situation.
---
At this point the question isn't "will there be another Flamelash?" its "when will there be another Flamelash?"
---
Arena meta is fine though in tbc. War/druid loses to mage/rogue which loses to warlock/sham which loses to war/druid. It opens up a lot more in 3s and 5s as well.  
---
The biggest problem is: figuring out what patch to play on and how long arena seasons last. The thing to remember is that TBC had a very short lifespan before being bumped by wotlk.
---
It's too easy to prove you wrong by the direct quote
---
&gt;We are fairly sure — we can't know for sure without being fortune tellers, but most of them align — there will be a fairly steep drop off compared to that day one interest, and we want to make sure because of how important community is in Classic in particular, that we have healthy server populations.
---
&gt;That's why we're not jumping to, hey, let's just open up dozens and dozens of servers. We have the ability to do that. This isn't about limiting costs or available hardware or anything like that. We could do that easily if we wanted to, actually much more easily than having complicated tech like layering.
---
&gt;But where we would that leave us down the line is with underpopulated servers that we have to start looking at merging or offering transfers from them to other servers to get back down in population. That's tremendously disruptive to communities and something we really, really, really want to avoid.
---
*"I'm a strong independend Wo....rrior and I Don't need no Hu....ealer"*
---
You must utterly deny reality to accept some of your premises as reasonable. Players form bonds and attachments to their server, their guild, the players on their server, their reputation, their competing guilds, and the sense of community this all affords them. "Just move" is not good advice when it entails them leaving behind so much. Many of them would most likely rather quit than start over, too.
---
Your "preventative informing" isn't useful to anyone. I don't think there's all that many players who are not informed of the fact that they can create characters on other servers and play those instead.
---
What is useful is correctly identifying problems that cause significant amounts of players to feel like quitting, pinpointing their root causes, and coming up with solutions for them.
---
Increasing the server population by a factor of 5 is a huge change.
---
Do you really think that if we just instantly brought in 5x the people to your apartment it wouldnt be a big change ?

Unfortunately streaming meant I couldn't jump into and out of game to find reference images so none of the outfits match anything in game like I usually try to do.
---
I LOVE all of these wholesome interactions.
---
Why'd you accept a random friend request is the question.. Would seem a little fishy if I had just died in a fight and I got one out of the blue.
---
Thanks :)
---
Having collected 200+ Black Lotus as of now I can confirm that the static 60 min shifted to something between 45 and 75 minutes.
---
People legit threaten to come to your house and kill you and Blizzard doesn’t ban them. Actiblizz lovea da moneys.
---
Really? So all the "I've already played x days on my character though!" responses to suggestions of rerolling aren't applicable?
---
Yeah, it's noticeable how this subreddit just became a complaints service recently.
---
Sadly, I notice it a lot in game subreddits. Everyone trying to be an armchair developer. I've seen this faction queue idea floating around too much here and I thought I would try to explain to some people how it's not a solution. 
---
Of course, once you think of something that sounds good, you stop thinking! Nah, don't need to consider the drawbacks of my solution,  it sounds good and therefore it is good!
---
A lot of the solutions are basically tweaked versions of what retail needed to use. 
---
War mode just like retail.  Let each pvp server have it's own over sub server.  Possibly have it only enabled when the server is worse than 55/45. Have to go main city to turn it off, just like retail. Deactivate anywhere.
---
The mercenary system for world pvp. Let them queue up as the smaller faction and give them bonus honor for it. Sure, people will try to abuse it, just be real harsh with the punishment. 
---
Remove updated PvP gear until later phases, cap honor until later phases, or remove decay. Remove the incentive for people to essentially ruin the game for other people at all costs solely for gear until some time in P4-P6 or make it significantly easier to get. 
---
Waiting so incredibly long to act after recognizing the problem and deciding a solution by delaying the introduction of BGs for so long was a terrible mistake and a poor sign of what's to come.
---
I’d say it’s more of them not implementing better faction balance changes, i.e. offering free server transfers, then seeing the outcome and how minority factions start to transfer out, giving us a situation where a 70/30 horde dominated server loses all the ally, down to the last two-decimal number of lvl60s that will be on at any given time. And then the devs don’t even blue post recognizing the issue even exists, let alone try to fix it.
---
You can't fix stupid.
---
Statistics that Horde dominate most servers? U live in a fuckin cave? If you think this is crying, you have a rought time ahead of you in life, dont be oversensitive.
---
There is no Horde, there is no Alliance, there's only shitty players being shitty.
---
And a lot of people, me included, saw this coming from a mile away.
---
Let alone the fact that you crying about me supposably crying.
---
I never said there weren't fights, I said that hordes outnumber alliance. Just last Kazzak alliance had 70 people and horde had (at a minimum) 120 people.
---
I’d argue they initially did a pretty good job and only really fucked it all up from mid wotlk onwards
---
You are so fuckin cringy, yikes. There is no way you have a guild ingame.
---
* PvP server
---
* "I wanna farm in peace"
---
Choose one.
---
They are shitcunt humans is why. Get used to it.
---
1.12 introduced cross realm bgs
---
-Look at me: You are the mob now!
---
As you failed to respond to my post, merely reiterated what you said in your previous post and added something unrelated, I will take this as that you are unable to rebut my arguments and I am victorious in this exchange. Hurray! :-)
---
Sounds like the perfect quest for a Tauren Druid!
---
So you are a trash PVP player who cant comprehend how strong stun resist and WOTF is? Got it. 
---
Stoneform LOL, only useful against rogues. Fear Ward gets instant dispelled. 
---
Vs a fuckin 25% stun resist or 5 sec immunity to fear and seduces, use your brain.
---
True, but the corruption levels would be incredible high and many mats would be stolen in process.
---
Damn that guy fucked you up, he even took your will to trash talk back with that ass beating.
---
CCing someone until the honorless buff goes away isn't baneable. What you're thinking of is the exploit of mind control dueling to remove the buff and only give honor to the duelers.
---
I care about the health of the game but would rather see it die than suffer through complaints morphing it into another retails. A form of euthanasia if you will.
---
And again, if you want "fair pvp" wait for the organized stuff.
---
You mean like how people hate getting camped over and over and over again? Let people vent.
---
Why farm me? like go to brm or burning steppes where People gather to pvp. like theres a difference in farming 1 person who pvps little to Groups of pvper in other areas
---
The only feasible solution I think is allowing faction changes. The absolute biggest issue with it is the shaman/paladin thing and I think youll just have to make it so shamans become paladins and have it so you can trade shaman/pally gear to certain sham/pally gear. Other horde/alliance specific gear thats only avaliable to their respective faction is just able to stay on that character, like the nordic longshank from uld that only horde have access to for example, they can just keep using that if they please.  
---
I think i might be missing something else, but im not sure. I think it will suck but its most likely the best possible solution. I only have a shaman alt that I very much enjoy playing and idk if they were my main, would be very difficult to change. Im not sure though. If people refuse to change would  then faction based queues be necessary to force them? I dont see how it wouldnt effectively choke the server.  
---
Another thing too is that, the possible solution can be to allow faction change and simply make it so you can just play both factions if you have a shaman/pally thats high level. Idk.
---
For sure. A world designed for 2000-3000 players and you triple or quadruple the population ? of course it's a shit fest. Every resource node respawn time amount of mobs etc is all tuned around way less players.  It's like allowing 300 people to zone into one molten core and then wondering why everything dies instantly.  
---
The realm size is probably one of the biggest things that got changed. In vanilla I could go an hour without seeing a member of the opposite faction at times. In classic that is impossible.
---
Its vertical super resolution that causes flickering on amd.
---
Lol who gives a flying fuck about windfury, the fact that you bring that up as what makes horde good shows you dont know shit about PVP. If you want to be a PVP min maxer you will play Horde i cant comprehend some of you cant grasp that LOL.
---
There are already tier bonuses that are straight up talents (tier 1 3/8 set bonus for shaman as an example). There's no reason they couldn't do something similar for whatever meme spec they want to balance. To balance for PvP you can just nerf stats that aren't important for PvE but are important for PvP. Ret pally set pieces could make them super squishy much like fury warriors are now.
---
I do agree that talent tree changes are a more interesting way to go about this (since being pidgeon holed into specific gear in a late phase raid that your guild won't want to carry your ass through isn't really ideal). However, I feel like the #nochanges crowd would bitch less about new content/items than they would about a talent tree revamp.
---
Personally I knew it was going to be bad and never even entertained the notion of participating.
---
What I didn't know was that my guild was going to get caught up in the headlights and would stop trying in PVE because they "have to rank."
---
Now two weeks later they're all getting burnt out by how garbage the system is but the guild philosophy is still fucked.
---
Also a 21/0/30 ret paladin can dps decently in dungeons and you get some strong healing talents.
---
This
---
What you think bgs are fair? Rankers look more forward to bgs than anyone else cause they will be able to pubstomp with premades
---
That's not at all what the experiment tested though.  The guards did not control whether or not they did anything *EXCEPT* feel pain.  Know of what you speak before you make an ass of yourself even further.
---
I agree. I just treat classic as a game I beat so far. I am playing other things atm

Lmao this explains why my guild and my friends guild has been hassling people about the douse quest.
---
No fucking way am I going to silithus to be a free honor kill, I would rather just play another game if we cant summon ragnaros because nobody can finish the quest.
---
Are you mentally challenged or just reading comprehension issues? I literally say i dont care about racials enough to EVER pay for a change. Jesus fuckin christ you are slow
---
Imagine faction specific queues
---
It’s called making friends, dude. By the way you write I’d wager you just aren’t much good at it
---
The alternative is letting the faction balance continue to slide towards 100% horde on most PvP servers, particularly the big ones, as alliance players unsubscribe. With server pop caps being so much higher than they were in vanilla, the world is much more densely populated--saturated, even--what might have been a tolerable imbalance with 500-2k players online total is now an impossibly frustrating situation.
---

https://youtu.be/ipQBFDb_SFI
---
Damn, that sucks. I'm on horde herod too, but I haven't seen any of that.  I'm late pacific time US.  You should play with a different group of people...
---
I don't see how unbalanced factions would kill a PvE server?
---
Where are you getting this farce of a 55/45 60/40 split idea from?
---
Which realm it is?
---
So you wouldnt consider having to share your home with 5x more people a change ?
---
How fucking dense do you need to be not to understand how huge of a change the increased population sizes on servers is.
---
Right? Learn to use your pieces correctly, then maybe you can overcome the disadvantage!
---
Earthfury
---
That’s not what is banable if they are just waiting out the honor less target buff. It’s no different from rogues who sap or mages who sheep for the same reason. What is banable is a different exploit which allowed them to ignore honor less target entirely.
---
But who would take that option?
---
They should give players on the weaker, unbalanced faction a +50% EXP buff from 1-48 to encourage people to reroll and level up new characters.
---
This could be implemented on servers that have worse than a 66/34 split.
---
I play horde on Mograine and it doesnt feel like 60/40 at all, I get ganked all the time in EPL, Winterspring and especially Feralas. Shout out to this Dwarf rogue called Verner who is camping Camp Mojache 9-5. Surely he must have the highest honour on Alliance side.
---
In the lore spirit healers are a type of valkyr who won't let us permanently die because we have a purpose.
---
Lol, is this in Azshara? You guys *are* annoying. I trinketed and escaped the other day and told you all to eat a bag of dicks in /yell.
---
This guy takes the cake though
---
Blizzard doesn't want to "fix" the issues. They are just milking Classic players for anything they can get while doing as little as humanly possible.
---
Classic community corfirmed enen more toxic than overwatch
---
Thank you! :3
---
That’s exactly what’s good about it
---
It does result in an empty server.
---
That's not regular.
---
Please dont try to make sense..
---
Horde bad!
---
Oh man the boats from Menethil Harbour in particular, some really pathetic players who either won't join a guild or are in guilds so bad that they can't organise a couple guys to escourt across them, as a result there's no end of dumb complaints.
---
such stupid and egotistical people.
---
Hahaha you, are probably right. From what I've heard and seen it definitely goes both ways. I wish they would bring out bg's already, I'm ok with getting camped as a rogue main I barely feel it. As for my friends who are playing wow for the first time and pay a lot of money to corpse run.
---
If the situation continues after BG's then the game will probably die, and then Blizzard will act smug and say "Told you so!". :-)
---
Exactly. The dwarves are awful. Give them to the horde! Id rather have something else anyways
---
Most of the time I dont do anything, cause I am sick of people like that. so why should I 1v1?
---
Sad trolling attempt
---
Azeroth auto pilot on twitch
---
Faction balance was never an issue until phase 2. The unbalanced faction made sure damn well they wanted to wipe out the other faction.
---
Just because you can corpse camp for honor doesn't mean you should. And if you do you really should have the mental capacity to realize it's not what people signed up for.
---
&gt; The proc and dps value are wasted. It's a vanity weapon that has nice base stats.
---
It had relevancy on pservers that had the thorns effect scale with "Flame Buffet" the debuff that comes from Arcanite Dragonling in Engi.
---
I'd second this, especially for horde. One or two resto shaman spamming healing wave for crit procs can keep a druid at over 10k armor easily. It doesn't even require super good gear and no other buff is required. Cat form is a LOT less viable than bear tanking, so you really want all the cat DPS talents you can get. The only exception to this would be the threat generation  talent. I would probably take that over a buff to your ferocious bite even though it hurts your cat dmg a bit.
---
Tanking a raid boss is really the only place that bear druid is going to be stretched thin. Most of our bear raid tanks go resto hybrid so they can heal when they aren't tanking.
---
But the main issue won't be which feral talents you take, but rather omen of clarity and the shift Mana cost talent in the Balance tree. The only way cat really stays competitive is having insane amounts of energy through power shifting and OOC procs. Powershifting isn't a great idea for bears because if you get hit by a boss ability in that split second you're out of bear you tend to be really dead.
---
Honestly I wish no changes wasn't that big of a crowd because the honor system is so bad its absurd.
---
Holy nova does not generate threat though
---
I do love a buffet of flames.

Thank you for the links.

---
Hunter with Bow of Searing Arrows
---
Yeah! Pussies! They don't even fight back when we outnumber them 10 to 1.LOL. Those pussies.
---
And they are so bad at pvp. It's ridiculous. Me and my 85 friends only rightclick the 5 alliance we are fighting against and they just die. LOL.
---
Yes
---
Thats why you add in free transfers with it, those servers had a problem because nobody could transfer off.
---
No, this isn't BFA.
---
This shit's better than that crap story. Because if this was a real story. The Horde wiped out the Alliance and realized they fucked themselves in the long run after the Alliance "abandoned" and went into hiding. There's no competition. There's nothing to oppose. The Horde now owns everything. The world is handed to them on a platter and they're yet.. unsatisfied.
---
The new big bad ( Ahn'Qiraj) cannot be fought against alone and ultimately they cannot do anything to fix it alone.  They've ruined their future for conflicts. There's no honor in slaying peasants (lowbies).
---
I guess I forgot how good undead was. I played undead dk. I am glad I'm playing alliance this time around but dang, horde just feel like they have a passive advantage in PvP.
---
Well maybe they should just reroll
---
&gt; Kek he's my tank!
---
I know you're laughing but a boomkin tank, is very much a thing in wow and has been for years on pservers.
---
Happy to answer more questions since I played one to tank raids multiple times.
---
*I reject your reality and substitute my own.*

Good back and forth. Have a good night!
---
Mine wasn't ironic. Not sure why people are downvoting me tbh. I thought naming and shaming was against the rules.
---
This is no way to talk to a child of God. Shalom my brother
---
&gt; That's 80 dps. Pretty good for moonkin
---
yup, plant yourself in melee and if you happen to go oom (which is rare) you can melee the boss.
---
We have more Ret Paladins than Holy ones. We regularly have four Rets in our raids. Probably because two of them are officers and one is the GL...
---
there is a difference between doing pvp to gain honor and basically camping every major city, inn-keep and fly-spot, slaughtering every single player, whether or not they give honor or not and corpse-camping which literally makes less honor than getting fresh targets.
---
If you can't see the difference between PvP and basically destroying the other factions ability to play the game until they are forced to leave, because people like you literally won't let them enjoy the game, then you are beyond help and part of the people who deserve to play in a solo-faction realm where PvP is impossible, because everyone else left.
---
Yes it does.. for honor..
---
Seems I do it a fair bit differently than other people here. I have some skills auto switch me stances, but to manually switch stances I have 2 binds. Q switches between Defensive and Battle (and always goes Defensive if I'm in Berserker). Shift+Q switches between Battle and Berserker (and always goes Berserker if I'm in defensive).
---
So with 2 binds (on the same key) I can toggle between all 3 stances at command. I'll admit thought that I'm not a huge fan of pressing Shift+Q.

---
What kind of Marxist bullshit is this?
---
Sure, they won a server... but at what cost?
---
Ahn'Qiraj now cannot be completed as the Alliance War Effort is now completely gone. The Horde lost an entire raid tier. As well as any leftover PvP requirements are damned impossible to achieve anymore. 
---
Sure, Battlegrounds are coming; but the PvP aspect of the game ruined the entire half of their desire. They rolled on a PvP server with no PvP to enjoy.
---
PvP hApPeNeD oN a PvP sErVeR am i rite
---
Blizzard has done it wrong from the start. At the beginning of the game they had to have blocked the creation of characters in the most populated factions of each server, and forced people to start creating characters in the other faction. And ofc releasing BGs 1 week after honor system.
---
yeah they should just man up, step outside of IF and get slaughtered like the cattle they are.
---
Just watched it. Definitely mass heal. The people are shown moving on the floor before the cast. And from a historical stand point for reference most people don't die instantly on a medieval battlefield, they would be wounded and dying as portrayed, so mass heal would have the effect seen.
---
I’ve been a gamer for 20 years and I have never had a moment like that. Even when I was a literal child. Don’t try and normalize someone being a nasty garbage human to another person just because it’s in a game. There is definitely something lacking in people who behave this way.
---
This guy
---
??
---
I disagree. Someone was repeatedly harassing me over undercutting them on the AH whispering me day after day. I reported it every time and opened a ticket for continued harassment. Haven't seen the person online in 3 weeks now.
---
I could believe this, thanks for the well worded reply! I hope they somehow solve the faction unbalance but I just don't know where to start besides bg's.
---
And I'm on a quiet server trying to get my emogoat and needing to find 4 balanced players to help me with each step. It's very exhausting and disheartening. Bring on bgs so I get more engaged.
---
Ohohohohoho
---
&gt; I remember seeing a mage in BC with Thunderfury. This is even wilder.
---
Most likely a mage tank, which is very much possible in TBC. He'd most likely equip it to save on mana when only little threat is required and attack the boss who has Judement of Wisdom to gain mana.
---
then enjoy broken systems that will eventually lead to realms being solo-faction areas for pure PVE.
---
Something needs to be forcefully done and change the currently broken system, and we obviously can't trust players to do it themself.
---
Lmao this loser is paying $18 just to harass you
---
Is this your first MMO? I cant comprehend when people demand perfect server balance. Ive played MMO's for 20years and not once have all the servers been balanced.
---
Former Flamelash Horde here, pretty much all Horde migrated too. Out of the top 20 Horde raid guilds only about 3 stayed including my former guild unfortunately.
---
So Blizzard closed the free transfer? 
---
I really wonder how that decision was made. ”Yo, alot of people have transfered, we have to save the realm!”
---
”50 ally’s should do it, close the transfers”
---
”9:1 horde favored? Well we did the best we could, close the transfers”
---
”Oh the realm is dead, close the transfers quick so that the remaining players are stuck!”
---
Blizzard offered free server transfers for 48 hours for EU Servers on Dec 5th.
---
Flamelash-EU was extremely Horde dominated, ranging likely to 30/ 70. This sheer imbalance made the server a toxic mess post Phase 2. Horde were camping EVERYTHING. Flight Paths, Raid Zones/entrances, Quest Hubs, and got so bad; even Alliance cities were hostile territory.  Every PvP instance had 1vs10. The Alliance were fucked in every way. 
---
Nearly the entire Alliance population of Flamelash - EU left. Leaving the Toxic
---
It’s like, yeah I want that to happen, but I also want players who took advantage thus far of server imbalance to feel the harsh negative effects of their decisions.
---
It absolutely is blizzard’s fault. They made zero attempts to mitigate server imbalance, and no human being wants to fight a losing battle instead of doing what they want, so faction imbalance always gets worse without intervention.
---
&gt;gloating on reddit about not being able to participate in half of the game
---
you mean spending half of your time corpserunning? yeah that's the part we gladly skip.
---
lol that's the thing people are waking up to now. Stalagg skeram herod etc are dying. flamelash DIED TODAY. It's 96:4. this is just the beginning. We are sitting here before the fucking storm hits and people are saying we are being alarmist.  You want certain servers to die? ok. where do those people go? they fuck up other servers. This will literally impact the entire game if blizzard continues to just let people transfer wherever. If people can't pvp because of queues, they will either destroy others experiences and hard camp, as we've seen, or quit. We can make the thousands of extra horde quit over months of horrible (pve essentially) gameplay, but really we need more people on alliance for real balance for the health of the community and pvp. the game will still not be enjoyable if we average out all pvp players across all realms. this doesnt fix the problem. we simply need more alliance, and we may need faction transfers as one of the last hopes down the line if we don't start doing things now.
---
&gt; Spam moonfire in between auto attacks with that long ass timer. Lowkey strong af
---
It has too be below the 1.5 GCD to be worth it which was very much a thing for boomkin's in Phase1 with fast daggers to do the most dps at the time.
---
200+150+100+50 at minimum
---
There is no queues on most servers.... People really love to come up with dumb ideas
---
Yeah, why would we want queues to stomp your sorry ass? I want instant gratification.
---
I just think it's funny. Full scrubbery on display from that guy.
---
How is 60/40 any sort of domination with servers at 70/30 and worse?
---
Get away with reading comprehension and logic, this is Reddit!
---
if your macro doesn’t work 50% of the time then it’s something wrong on your end, works fine for the rest of us.
---
Kind of the point.  If they had faction specific queues earlier it would have solved the problems, and they could still have them now despite there being no queues at this point, that's largely because the dominated factions have transferred off the servers.
---
Why not?
---
Guano is a real nice guy. Always down to chat and hangout with strangers. I blow that man a kiss whenever I see him.

Bloodfang EU? With horde camping every fp in the game? Let me guess: you are a horde om bloodfang?

---
And yes it is embarrassing to loose when you outnumber someone AND have 2 healers :D
---
Really though, the problem is that people play this game way too fucking much. This is the result of playing WoW for 12 hours daily. You get your raid gear really fast and then spend the rest of the time farming honor. It wouldn't be so bad if the campers would just take a break once in a while.

So months old data. Nice.

We definitely dont need more horde on bloodfang! Please stay away and leave us alone!
---
There’s a delay in your ability to trap. It’s a well known issue within the blue posts and largely complained about on the hunter discord... it’s all of us
---
"literally" is a word that is, peculiarly, its own antonym.
---
Can anyone help me what is happening here? Why is the Alliance quitting?
---
jesus, who is giving you all this advice?
---
I'm a NA player; so coming into this situation is just extremely amusing. From a player who loathes PVP in the fact it never can be truly balanced.  
---
Flamelash is the exact result of toxicity. Its Alliance population is so gutted; they've overtaken every resource for their precious Honor points.  They've killed all the options to farm that its impossible for them to achieve their ranks. They camp cities now hoping someone foolish enough to log in to kill. 
---
They over harvested their fields and now they're left with nothing. Congratulations; you played yourself and now you've:
---
\- Locked yourself out of Ahn'Qiraj. With No Alliance players; they cannot aid in the War Effort. Effectively lost an entire raid tier and must enter Naxx without AQ items.
---
\- Lost all other options outside of Queueing for Battlegrounds for Honor.
---
\- Will have the entire world handed to them without opposition. Making capture quests impossible to complete.
---
Or, you know, we can all just play the game how we want.
---
Spoken like a true doomsday prophet.
---
I doubt they had 6 people, you would had came back at the guy with that. You let him say that you outnumbered them and got recked, if they had more people you would had commented that. Stop lying my man :DD
---
Someone told me they were going to come to my house and kill me and they still whisper me regularly, long after Blizz said /ignore. Good for you.
---
Hello?
---
it actually feels this way. it feels like they just wanted to launch classic with no real management and just see how much they can get before it implodes. I love this game and the experience it's brought back and I really feel like the incompetent people in charge have single handedly sealed classics fate if nothing is done soon.
---
Well the reason people camp fp's, corpse camp, camp cities and inns is because there isnt enough enemies out in the world for them to go after. So while you may *think* you are getting less honor for corpse camping someone, you could not be any more incorrect as the ability to find a "fresh target" is nearly nonexistant. I could go out and basically run around several areas and not run into a single alliance for hours and the few times I do, theyre 5-10 strong. So basically forced to goto gadgetzhan and deal with the guards while picking at the few occsional alliance that stroll by.  
---
So youre really reaching there by trying to make it seem as if im purposely destroying the alliance's ability to play the game as you put it. No dude I want to pvp, but when the choice is either run into a group of alliance or sit at an fp to get some semblance of an even fight, youre damn right ill be sitting at the fp
---
Yeah I wish you just got banned.
---
That doesn’t translate to it “not working” 50% of the time, get real m8
---
[Template minus shill tags in case anyone else can use it](https://i.imgur.com/dIQo3yk.png)
---
What is there to fix? You dont know the whole story, what if OP was ganking a flight path and the other dude finally got his revenge? HOly shit this subreddit with all its sensationalists.
---
Fuck off. When you’re leveling an alt, no one wants to come and escort you on the boat every single time.
---
And getting chased by 2 undead priests around the boat and mind controlling you off every time is extremely pathetic and I’d call it griefing when done repeatedly.
---
this feels very retail but as i've said, we NEED more players to be alliance or the game will collapse on itself eventually. I think faction transfers would be easier and quicker, but maybe something like this, with incentives like you say could work.
---
He needs help. ):
---
You make 0 sense.
---
We are here to be upset, not looking for a fucking solution!!!
---
BC screwed up the feel of the game IMO.  
---
It abandoned the "faction vs faction" theme of the game.  Everyone is in Shattrah.  All pvp that matters is now "arena" and has nothing to do with your faction being at war.  This completely invalidated BG's for anything other than "Catch up pvp gear."  Some people don't care about this stuff but it changed the feel greatly. 
---
I think on the whole it was more positive than negative (Don't have the same opinion of WotLK) but I think the world building (and shrinking of the relevant world space), along with the abandonment of the "factions at war" feel of the game really made it feel not as interesting.  
---
I also didn't like what resilience did to the game's pvp.  Classic gets a little stupid in Naxx phases with people being 1 shot, but IMO resilience was a dumb ass way to handle it created just as many balance issues it solved.
---
Obviously he’s a complete dick but would you say ”its pvp dont gotta take it to heart man” to all the allys crying about p2 and faction imbalance?
---
Ran into a level 57 priest in BRD the other day that didn't know her job as a healer was to heal.
---
Genuinely surprised she made it to that level.
---
Yikes why would they add the faction specific classes to both factions? That's gotta be a clear sign of the beginning of the end for WoW's game design.
---
Not to mention all of your "oh shit!" buttons (aside from dash) WIN the fight. As a rogue most of the time you've got to reset the fight if you over pull, and the downtime is killer.
---
With a small asterisk of "if not dying obviously".
---
Not everyone has to get defensive about a video game. What’s make you think he’s inclined to stand his ground against someone with that level of childish behavior? Better to let go instead of feeding into the toxic behavior
---
Nearly 50% of the time, the internal delay of FD on the current classic client won’t allow you to lay a trap until after 400th of a second. If you are engaged in combat you can’t get the trap off. It’s legit a blue post and I’m not sure why you’re trying to argue me on it at 4am lol
---
Also can't they just wait 5 mins for PvP to flag off? They are in a city.
---
Blizzard wouldn't have pulled the panic switch by releasing battlegrounds a month or two early if they weren't losing players to their honor system.
---
do you understand how fallacious this is? complaining about the game =/= it will turn into retail. Not doing something when something NEEDS to be done will only make sure it turns into a pile of one sided, pve garbage.
---
Who cares what COULD had happen, this is useless. Explain how they would have queues on servers without queues, purposely not letting people play, is this seriously your suggestion? Jesus christ..
---
That’s what I’m saying though. Dozens against the hundreds it would take for servers to be balanced is nothing. 
---
It would be gridlock. Most people won’t transfer out of a dominant position no matter how bad for the game it is.
---
Nearly 50% of the time, the internal delay of FD on the current classic client won’t allow you to lay a trap until after 400th of a second. If you are engaged in combat within that frame you can’t get the trap off. It’s legit a blue post and I’m not sure why you’re trying to argue me on it at 4am lol
---
Earthshaker more than doubled in size and anywhere you go theres 5 mans, 2 servers were ruined here.
---
Actually kinda feel bad for the guy. If he takes a computer game that seriously just imagine what his quality of life is like. It's no wonder he's got that number noted down.
---
No one said that's how %'s work. Of course it's still 60/40 but instead of say 100 online at one time, being 60 horde and 40 ally - this would be fine. It's when you start to scale the numbers that it gets out of hand. Of course it's still 60/40 but it will feel like 80/20 if server is at capacity.
---
It is how percentages work.  
---
If every zone has 10 people in it, and 6 are horde and 4 are alliance, it won't really be an issue, even though it's 60/40.  They won't all be in each other's face constantly.  Even if it was horde roaming in groups of 3 and alliance roaming in two groups of two ensuring that alliance usually or always lost, it wouldn't be a constant thing, and it wouldn't feel as bad.  
---
If every zone has 100 people in it and 60 are horde and 40 are alliance, there's going to be people literally everwhere and alliance are going to be outnumbered 2:3 and getting killed constantly.
---
Watching paint dry is the same as playing the most successful video game in the world?
---
Dunno bout that one buddy.
---
Arcane protection and fire protection.
---
yeah I main shaman. it's really sad to think I'd have to stay behind if my guild transferred. I will not play a pali. the playstyle is too different and I wouldn't enjoy it. Otherwise, I would transfer if I could, or if they somehow allowed shaman on alliance like in bc, but I doubt that'd happen anytime soon.
---
No intercept, no pummel, no whirlwind, no berserker rage... don't roll warrior for L29 bracket.
---
Ban this idiot please
---
Damn I didn't think dwarf women could get any uglier. I was wrong.
---
So set your hearth in kargath...
---
On this server is nothing possible anymore so fuck it.
---
They're are more alliance in you're if than skullflame EU, it's empty most of the time
---
49 especially. Kang the Decapitator + Mortal strike is meaaaann
---
Can't make alts on a PvP server. Once you chose your side; until you delete your Horde toon.
---
Only watched the first bit.
---
I think when they said “Alliance first kill on KJ” they probably meant “Alliance first” on their own server. They didn’t say “World Alliance first” or anything.
---
Because he answers him, otherwise he would just ignore and move on if he didnt want to stand his ground.
---
Literally if someone says you outnumbered them and rage like that, the absolute best response would be "ehm, you guys outnumbered us, what are you on about" and you know it. 
---
OP got wooped while he outnumbered the other guy, probably ganking constantly too:
---
"ur fuckin rank 3 farming here ALL THE TIME" 
---
What do you think he means by that??
---
it's fucked man. I wish for the best for classic, but I can't help but think it's already too late. Flamelash will need to be handled, which will only fuck other servers.
---
Do you have premade prepped and ready for tuesday ?
---
If not, then you´re fucked and good luck going above 10-11 which you could have been able to get anyway with out this pointless ganking.
---
So many of these griefers dont understand that they didnt need those honor points because they´re not ready to play with the big boy nerds who grind premades 16 hours a day.
---
And miss out on free karma and a good laugh?
---
So who cares what could have happened when the complaint is the devs fucked up by not taking *any* measures to ensure any semblance of faction balance on servers?  Isn't that what this post is about?  Whether it's fair to assign blame to devs?  
---
Also yes, assigning queues to servers with extreme imbalances would improve the situation greatly.  Queues always purposely stop people from playing for a variety of reasons.  Explain why extreme population imbalance couldn't be one of them?
---
Honestly I'll trade not having world buffs in order to avoid insane lag spikes while everyone and their mother waits around for said buffs.
---
Plus, as nice as wolrd buffs are, 2/3rds of the  time I'm going to be killed in PvP before I really get to see the benefits of them.
---
Yeah I'd love to have an hour long queue time because my server has a lower population. /s
---
Are you using some addons? I dont have that option.
---
Where do you suggest people wait the 5 minutes to unflag for pvp?
---
That's why my hearth is in kargath, and then I just buy a portal to TB.
---
Where can I find good Paladin pvp guides? 
---
Wowhead and icy veins seem elementary
---
You’ve got to be a child with the way you just responded to me. Quit harassing these WoW redditors and god bless your heart bro.
---
"It's when you start to scale the numbers that it gets out of hand."
---
How exactly, its still 60/40, more enemies but more allies.
---
I agree the amount of players makes a lot of thing 
---
//no change 
---
66:33 wouldn’t be a problem if it was 2k 
---
Because not every place is over camped.
---
You see “witch hunt” originates from accusing innocent women of being witches with no real evidence at all. In this case though, we have actual proof that the guy in chat is more than toxic. 
---
Also it doesn’t even display his Btag number, so there’s no way for people to go after him or know what char he is - except if you had this guy in your friendlist and recognize it. In that case it’s up to you how to react to him.
---
&gt;So youre really reaching there by trying to make it seem as if im purposely destroying the alliance's ability to play the game as you put it.
---
never said it was on purpose.  
---
but that doesn't remove the fact that people like you are doing it. Whether by accident or on purpose does not matter. You are the kind of players that are chasing other players away from the realm by basically making it impossible for them to enjoy the game.
---
hint: You can PvP without making the game literally unplayable for others, you just choose to take the easy option, rather than the right option.
---
50% is a blatant lie, yes it does happen rarely but not at all as often as you make it out to be. No serious hunter player has 50% failure on fd+ trap, if you have 50% then the issues is on your end.
---
Mmmm could you explain how you come to this conclusion?
---
I’ve been farming BL for a while now and also assumed between 60 and 70 minutes.
---
&gt;I also dont understand how you think achievements or dualspec will exactly split the community as both were added in wotlk not tbc.
---
Little known fact I guess but they were released in TBC. Though ya I guess it just feels like dual spec was out in TBC. Just achievements for TBC then.
---
Yeah being on a horde dominated realm as a horde player does not put a blanket of invincibility over you. My realm is horde dominated, I get ganked _all the time_ on my lvl 51. The time playing vs corpse running is 50/50 at best.
---
 Searing gorge has death squads camping the flight path, the feralas bridge towards DM has always a death squad of at least 5 people on it, Un'Goro has multiple people just patrolling the most common questing routes, hinterlands has death squads roaming for questing horde. Just because you have a 60/40 ratio doesn't mean you have constant body guards roaming with you. You'll die. A lot.
---
you can do world pvp on a pve server you know ? And given the shitshow some pvp servers are, i'd dare say that you have more world pvp on a pve server (because sorry, being ganked 30 vs 1 and griefed for half an hour isn't really participating in world pvp)
---
This is a meme, thats what this post is about. i mean did you open the funny picture?
---
There isn't one in the UD grotto?
---
Hi, /u/TridomKing

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e7ci4t/what_if_p2_wpvp_was_the_motivation_behind_you/). 
---
Linking suicide prevention hotlines? Nah, I do tell people to get fucked when they've been harassing for a while, but nowhere near this
---
Yes you are, open world PvP sould be done in certain areas. Ganking at flight points isnt cool, shit like that will kill classic.
---
The only problem i have is that Blizzard does not seem to see anything from a foot away.
---
If you want to distill it down to those levels, then someone murdering you and your family members is just living life.
---
You went to a point of real retardation with that.
---
blizzard had 15 years worth of server data and also could have accessed data from private servers.    
---
They could of implemented server caps, faction caps, faction based queues, free faction transfer to multiple servers w/ both pve/pvp options.     
---
They choose to do none of that. It's entirely their fault.
---
I love this guy
---
The stuff with the bus and wishing someone death is actually ban worthy and against ToS  
---
Write a ticket or whatever.  
---
He will be banned for that
---
Maybe you only read the first part.. I don't act like a "toxic prick" someone who was acting like a complete cunt was deservedly called a cunt, nothing more, nothing less.
---
Afterwards, I got my chat ban for a week, and everyday during that week, said cunt taunted me in whispers about how badly I fucked up calling her a cunt and how they would make sure I got permanently banned if I did it ever again, while also telling me they know I can't reply. I guess that makes me the "toxic prick" in that situation.
---
People are awful, thanks for proving my point.
---
With level 1 tourists
---
Ya I guess it could. I meant it like it is but I'll admit I thought the mods would delete it since its it's obviously just harassment.
---
Ugh. Dude is obviously trolling and fucking with him 
---
It’s a video game you’re supposed to get into it and talk shit don’t be so sensitive
---
Well then its shit all around and were just waiting for the inevitable PvP server crash because people cant behave.
---
And your attitude seems to be off, since its slightly shit lets let it all go to shit.
---
I mean whatever, I play this game for fun so its not my problem.
---
It has nothing to do with the fucking 50%... you have about a 400th of a second internal delay on your FD effect allowing you to throw down a trap. 
---
Therefore, when you hit the macro and by chance a dagger rogue or warriors is winding up on you it will trigger combat before you can get a trap off. Stop looking for an argument at 4am and go to the hunter discord?
---
Night mate.
---
Wtf? I responded to you with valid arguments, how the fuck does that make me "a child". I love when people have 0 logical comebacks and go:
---
"you are a child"
---
"you are a troll"
---
0 benefit in regular dungeons though
---
I've spoken to many in my guild about this. PVP minded people will transfer to get more pvp if they keep their character. They will not reroll, but I do think this would significantly help the problem.
---
&gt; God I hope this is a troll comment
---
Nope it's 2019. A decent warrior tank doesn't really need tfury's threat it's simply over-kill on threat. In a good guild outside of progression or world first races no good guild should come close to a warrior's threat.
---
The rules are not "dont witch hunt unless its an actual witch"
---
What little known fact? They were both introduced in wotlk. Your statement is incorrect and I dont see why achievements would be added to tbc when they werent originally there either.
---
why didn't you put him on /ignore?
---
is this kid serious^
---
His angry logic moments are the best.
---
the rank 1 pvper is gonna have like 2k honor for the week lol
---
Comparing a game with a family getting murdered then saying i went to a point of real retardation. Big fuckin yikes from me. Rememeber this is a game, dumb cunt.
---
Please have a parent or guardian notarize said argument for verification. You sound like a top notch attorney with these elite arguments bro. May god bless your heart and guide you through these troubled times.
---
&gt; And your attitude seems to be off, since its slightly shit lets let it all go to shit.
---
No, I want balanced servers. I just don't think faction queue is a good solution.
---
Like the system might have worked out when the servers were launched intially, but you can't put it on a shit server 3 months later, which will block the vast majority of the server to even be able to log into their character.
---
Some servers are irredeemably bad, but other servers can be salvaged (the ones which are 43/57 ish if blizzard does faction transfer right, and only let people to transfer to servers where their faction are in the minority).
---
14/15 in Naxx before TBC dropped... myself and everyone in on old guild will never have the same experience.
---
I realized that after about 7-8 days after this new classic was released. I'm very content now knowing what I was hoping to be able to recreate is not feasible.
---
Bullshit and a lie.
---
They are releasing bg’s only 1.5 weeks before schedule.
---
Like they release DM before schedule.
---
If the situation was so dire like this subreddit is trying to depict, we would have bg’s by now.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeport plx :D
---
This guy instantly failed his vibe check. What the fuck is wrong with him?
---
Stupid question: How are cross faction whispers possible?
---
&gt; the so called "shaman tanking".
---
For those of you who want to actually tank, there's a [whole guide](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150).
---
I admire you patience.
---
Dire Maul is awesome
---
Is Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza event currently in this phase?
---
Damn it lol I should’ve know that
---
We dont use a single shield for tanks.
---
Its useless in MC.
---
the honor system is objectively garbage, (coming from huge pvp player from vanilla) and changing it would help- but it's not what we need to fix the balance right now. there's many tbc things that I want that probably wont happen for a while, but there's some other things that can be done to balance faction health that we've been talking about.
---
Was this in classic?
---
We get it, flamelash ally is dead. Time to stop beating the dead horse for karma
---
Battle tags are not unique, so it might not be him
---
Think you are missing a /s there buddy
---
Why didn't you just remove him from your friends list?
---
My four buddies and I rerolled on a pve server. I agree with you 100%. It's so much better.
---
The cunt in question was a pally trashtalking Dalaran sewers, using immunity trinkets from broken shore, fishing pole artifact to glitch from one side of the map to the other, and running into the safe zone to talk more trash about how they were undoubtedly the greatest player in the game and how shit and awful everyone was. Me, being a rogue with a decent amount of pvp xp saw the moment, and killed them while they tried to do any cheese strat to win. I then said, "I got ya cunt" and that was that.
---
It's all about context man, was I in the wrong? sure, but were they some patron saint who was definitely not acting like a toxic person? no.. Yet like all her friends she told to report me, you're incredibly quick to take one side.
---
Like I said in my very first post, I don't do anything to upset people like you or her anymore. I dot my i's and cross my t's. I don't step out of line or say anything to hurt peoples fragile feelings. I am a very tame person, they however, likely never changed and have probably gotten more people like myself banned.
---
mainly good. i started out on a server that had insufferable queing times, balance was H55/A45 i guess, but the total numbers were just too high.  
---
so i transferred to a less populated server. now i was able to level to 60.  
---
then the fire nation attacked. i mean alliance guilds organized a mass transfer, and now the population is H30/A70, and that sucks, cause world pvp is fun, but not if youre outnumbered every hour of the day.
---
Battlegrounds were initially planned to open in phase 3, along with Blackwing Lair and the Darkmoon Fair, which Blizzard has said is happening sometime in early 2020. 
---
Battlegrounds were said to be happening sometime in the week of December 10th which was later clarified to exactly December 10th. 
---
Where is this 1.5 weeks coming from?
---
Youre really dense arent you?
---
It’s not a witch hunt though
---
What do you mean "current" honor system?This is the vanilla system. It's not like they dreamt it up last year. 
---
People screamed for vanilla servers for years and now that it's here no one is happy. It sucks but this is absolutely what people asked for. 
---
I'm enjoying myself perfectly on a fairly balanced realm (45/55) so I guess I can count myself as lucky.
---
I hope they roll out classic+ or something in a year or two so that we can shape classic into a better game, because clearly people are not as happy with classic as they anticipated.
---
yeah blizz really handled this so poorly it's astonishing.
---
thats a pretty harmless discussion you guys are having, not even worthy to make a thread about.
---
Got both in 10 runs total.  
---
  I'm a Shaman.
---
Full Scrubbery lmao.
---
I’m using this sentence in games now
---
It's actually exactly the plot in the South Park episode. One uber nerd griefing everyone until they quit the game.
---
So we all really just gonna ignore the penis sword?
---
You are damn right!
---
Battleground released 6 weeks after introducing the honor system in vanilla.
---
Blizzard try to follow vanilla timeline.
---
Conclusion? 1.5 weeks earlier.
---
ye, blizz did absolutely nothing nor made the situation worse with their decisions. stay woke.
---
I don’t have that option either, unless they recently added it.
---
Well, Rogues are not amazing in organized group pvp. They can get more honor when they roam solo or in a small group of 2 or 3. They are good in WSG, AB and AV though. And because BG’s will give a much higher average honor compared to World PvP, if they want to rank up efficiently, they will start playing BG’s.
---
That would alleviate some of the issue, but wouldn't change the inherent flaw of the system.
---
My favourite is bear Mt (me) and sad warrior ot sitting in the corner
---
If you use any skill that touches him, he attacks you. There are some tricks though  like warrior can charge and stopattack to get up quickly to ally flightmaster at Thorium point.
---
Where can I find this picture in better quality?
---
I was leveling Engi on an alt while watching this go down as i ran from tinkertown to the great forge.    Looked fun - but man Horde had us outnumbered.
---
It bothers me that this kind of person exist. He's so frustratingly unintelligent
---
Blame #nochanges crowd. Classic could've been a masterpiece. It's still good and better than retail, but could've been amazing.

---
there are no over-sized servers on classic either so either the servers need to be capped at 2k or we admit the obvious truth that this isn't classic and was never going to be the moment overpopulation was introduced 
---
The only solution to this shitshow is going back to actual classic like servers or admitting this isn't classic and balancing the game accordingly
---
A few hundred gold you’ll be alright, just don’t get thousands off him. Blizzard doesn’t care over a little bit of gold, they want your sub money.
---
Hahahaha this is gold
---
Im fine with my server but they should at least open up transfers to pve servers for people who made a mistake , im pretty sure you could do that in vanilla
---
We transferred to Earthshaker!
---
So i just had freezing band drop randomly and im a 57 hunter. Should i wait for bg to come out to sell? And what should i do with the gold. Im super excited btw lol.
---
Well, at least Flamelash Horde didn't need to re-roll to a PvE server, they just PvP'd their way to one.
---
I don't think the honor system is at fault here tbh, it's just that bgs aren't out yet and this is the only way to farm honor right now
---
I'll take 10
---
If you’d read the novel concerning them you’d know this is entirely false. There are pacifist forsaken that want nothing more than meet with their former human family. Sylvanas was retconned sure, seems someone has to be garrosh, and the plaque doctor guy from wrath is like you describe, but to condemn them all is a leap.
---
Of course you are
---
Your experiences are not as universal as you seem to think they are.
---
its only 13/mo if you buy a whole year, so $780
---
IIRC Cataclysm had a quest where you are a quest giver.
---
The definition of pathetic
---
It's like people with free wills have different aspirations and dreams. It makes it much more "real" that some UD hate it and want to go back to their old lives while some embrace it and wish only destruction and chaos
---
Yes, I hope the queues will be brutal as f***. We need more salt.
---
Debate topic: introduce queues to character creation of favoured factions on imbalanced servers (at some critical ratio) 
---
Maybe just for your first character, since after that it's just alts. But it seems like a subtle way to keep players from overpopulating a favoured faction
---
You would still eventually get your character, after waiting maybe a week
---
And it would not introduce a net reduced activity like faction specific login queues would
---
As someone that only PVPed at this expac resilience was a lifesaver. That is the stats that allow pvp boys to leave PVE and raid, it as been remove so the PVE boys can be relevant in PVP in raid stuff.
---
I can understand the argument with BG but not in arena.
---
So the strat is to pull Plaguebats looking like a moron to bait a gank?
---
&gt;freezing band

pve item?

Winning an argument never felt better.

If more people did the census and oploaded data, it would be fairly accurate. It depends entirely on us. 
---
Get the addon and participate.
---
This is a bit much even for League.  League has its fair share of toxic players but I feel like this is a special breed of loser.
---
Well the honor system incentivizes people do what they are doing. People weren't complaining this much before honor because this wasnt occurring. If you rolled on a pvp server and expected anything less than people trying to maximize honor then thats just ignorant.
---
The backlash and other consequences of fixing it are far better than the backlash and consequences of doing nothing.
---
You die and then wait 5 mins as a ghost. Hearth, get up, grab a snack, pet your dog, call your mom, and then go back to it and res.
---
&gt; Is prot pala viable for raiding? Is Boomkin viable for raiding? Is arcane viable for raiding?
---
&gt; I think subtlety goes under the same topic. Sorry :/
---
Everything is on a tier list. And nothing you said is on the same tier.
---
Lmao, maybe if the map size also scaled with the population size
---
How did you whisper each other?
---
Nah. The Immovable Object (Alterac Valley exalted) is an easy-to-get purple with more armor, stamina, and block value than Draconian though.
---
Get a few pvp kills a week as one of the 10 remaining alliance players and be grand marshall within 2 weeks!
---
How'd it go?  
---
Did my first 10/10 - 0 wipes last night as well after a few 6/10's with multiple wipes.      
---
Go told to bring a few things less than I had read on my class discord and other places.  
---
Hardest part was getting into MC as the Allies have it camped pretty hard.
---
Maybe next he'll wreck you with the "no u"
---
It turns out you had a bad source. If you actually look into it the wiki is written correctly but very misleading. Achievements were actually released during TBC.
---
It doesn't matter what the OP did. You just must not behave like this.
---
&gt; Yeah that's not true. A very lucky boomkin might match a mage for a short while but in this phase they are screwed by RNG due to 2% max spell hit.
---
Most good boomkin's will just end up crit parsing anyway.
---
Bad source I guess. If you do some real checking it was released before Wrath's launch.
---
Then reroll alliance, carebear. The horde have been telling me to do that anytime I complain about being ganked in IF the second I login.
---
I already have a 60 alliance character. Don't need to reroll.
---
how is it blizz's fault? the players chose the server and chose to desert them. blizz can't force you to play x faction on x server it's the people that left fault.
---
Ur dumb as shit
---
I noticed this as soon as I placed it but the more I tried to reshape the blade or slightly alter the position the more obvious it looked!
---
FeBtw
---
It just sounds boring, and wouldn't make me any gold.
---
&gt; I'd go sub if my pride could take being 10th or worse on meters, thats assuming your guild would even let you eat a debuff slot in a raid.
---
You're not entirely correct. I expand on this notion on Roxor99 comment.
---
800g (assuming you’re honored with your faction, which it’s almost impossible not to be)
---
I could see myself do a faction change for the greater good if that was available. But, leveling again, do pre raid bis, start at 0 gold.. no thanks!
---
Before you remove him, make sure he knows hw is reddit famous. If he aint perma banned already?
---
I did this jump last night by mistake. I was aiming to land on the roof above the corpses and try to stealth in via the npc.  
---
I landed in the lava and thought fuck, yet another corpse run, when all of a sudden I see the MC loading screen.  
---
I can't wait to do it again.
---
They won because they can have the technicality of playing on a 'hard' pvp server while functionally playing on a pve.
---
I dont really care, I just play on the server and adapt
---
That's one thing i don't like about mounts. As soon as people get their mounts, they will no longer buff each other when passing by. Was very disappointing to me while leveling.
---
I think classic taking OSRS's approach to their game would've been very smart for them, but they decided to do it how they wanted (lazily it seems) and I think the only ones paying will be the players. until they don't anymore. 
---
The spirit of vanilla should be preserved, but the game has to be adaptive too.
---
Tbh you can never ever blame the players for doing something that ruins any game if it's a possibility
---
It's not a race lol
---
Not really.. I just think they shotgunned this out in chronological order but failed to realize how lackluster a phase with only world pvp, no battlegrounds, and no new PvE content would turn out. 
---
I think that’s why they moved the release of BGs up to Tuesday instead of ~two months from now in February.
---
Homie you're on a PvP server and you're not fighting back in 1v1s??? Am I missing something here? Why wouldn't you roll PvE instead?
---
Stoneform is way better than shadowmeld since in vanilla you can't use sm in combat.
---
wait i gank people at feathermoon strong hold solo most time so am i a good player? :D
---
People sucking is a constant in every game. It's 100% the devs fault whenever there's a gameplay issue
---
&gt;They did it to themselves, now Blizzard allows them to go ruin another server.
---
I gotta say, I find this funny because that's sort of how the horde was in actual lore. At least at first.
---
Just add faction queues. Region-lock the servers as well. Whitemane is infested with non-American players.
---
Is it impossible or just a lot harder?
---
Considering on the more balanced servers people are having fun and to a variable extent enjoying it I would say no.  They didn't have server transfers in vanilla due to overpopulation that result in such wildly unbalanced servers.  Also didn't help that they released so few servers for early character creation which seem to be the worst offenders for imbalance (more servers they would have spread out more and hopefully been more balanced by later arrivals and/or faction locks).
---
How is it possible to be so wrong, yet so confident.
---
Exactly. I'm surprised so few remember (or even know) this which for me it's quite hard to comprehend. They beat the drum of #nochanges so much and yet the most glaring violation of it - population cap - has been violated since the very start. Why make such huge servers when the game was *designed* for a max pop of 3.5/4K ?!
---
Open a ticket and speak to a GM do not simply right click and report, that stuff gets ignored.
---
Yup, because the struggle between the horde vs alliance is best illustrated by gank squads roaming around the world making it impossible for anyone to do anything.   That's what the world of warcraft should look like....
---
I don't think you understand basic logic here. The honor system in Classic was implemented on servers having 3-4 times the population of Vanilla servers, ensuring that a 60-40 split becomes unbearable.
---
If we would had #nochanges, we would had Vanilla-like populations, where even a 65-35 split was considered balanced.
---
But in Classic, a 55-45 split is imbalanced...because of the POPULATION SIZE.
---
It is really that hard to understand that Blizzard is 100% at fault for creating servers based on their stupid estimation that 90% of the Classic players will quit before Phase 2?
---
Horde warrior, 2H PvE Should i still play hamstring spec even though i have Obsidian Edge blade? Or Arms with swordspec? Feel like i dont get as much Rage as arms.
---
Only thing devs could have done better was to make the servers more even 
---
But every server is the same, horde or alliance it dont matter, whoever's is the dominating faction just camps the same spots making people not want to log on 
---
I stopped playing and my server is not so bad its 60 to 40 in favour of the other faction. meanwhile some servers are even worse and their own capital cities are no go areas
---
I love Mograine.
---
This is the classic subreddit.
---
I support this discussion 100%. People are complaining about too many “whining” posts. Initially these same people said “there’s no problem,” then it was “you knew what you signed up for,” and now that everyone is willing to admit that this is a serious issue for the game’s longevity they immediately shoot down any suggestions about how to address these problems from the player base as not worth trying.
---
People continue to make these posts in spite of the terrible harassment they get for it BECAUSE they love this game and they are unhappy and they WILL stop playing if offered no reasonable solutions. 
---
And maybe I’ve been living in a bubble playing retail for the past 13 years but I haven’t seen this level of people being shitty to each other in public forums for no other reason than that they can since the birth of the internet. It really makes me sad that this is how we’re choosing to represent ourselves as a community.
---
and pvpers just want to dominate pve players...adding resil divided up the population.  Weather you think that is good or bad doesn't change the fact that it added more buckets.
---
Wow. That's a name I haven't heard in quite a while. Is he still alive? I remember him in the D3 video he was making.
---
stop posting low effort shit please
---
Don’t be ignorant :D it’s true
---
No
---
And you also have to hope that the enemy team doesn't report you. (Is reporting enemies still a thing?)
---
That's why you put the pve servers in the battlegroups as well.
---
I wouldn't worry too much about people like that.  This is their only form of enjoyment and they are probably dealing with thoughts of suicide themselves.
---
It's part of what makes classic bad imo. Half the items I cant get in raids are useless because designers were high. And hybrid classes are worse than they should be because of this.
---
you are right world pvp died even before bg's hit.  Flying made world design significantly harder.
---
Or in the case of R6 Siege, they just either teamkill you, or body block  you to get you killed.
---
You must have failed the basics on the math classes mate. Because it's not about solely about percentages. But I am afraid that you won't understand, even if I try to explain it to you.
---
probably macroed in.
---
2 to 1 is a fucked server?!
---
Thats if you can arrive in the city and not get targeted before the 5 min is up, you think we havent thought of this?... IF inn, mage quarter, and FP are all camped on our server. I die at least once per zone in. Not complaining anymore though, its the new normal, cant remember what its like without it..
---
Right.
---
I really don't think Herod is that bad lol
---
Oops, you're trash.
---
You actually don't understand math. 60/40 on 2k vanilla realm 15 years ago is 1200/800. 400 players on one side is not a big deal over our world designed for 3k max.
---
60/40 at 10k classic realm is a 2000 person difference on a relatively small map. Do you understand how this can lead to huge problems? Not to mention many huge servers are now 35:65
---
Seems pretty normal tame for an online game in this day and age.
---
&gt;Where I once saw alliance players as a potential nuisance that hopefully ignored me, I now see targets I have to either get rid of or avoid to survive.
---
Yeah. I always play pvp servers but I'm personally not much of a pvper. I generally leave people alone, though I don't tend to complain much when someone jumps me. On my server since p2, the slightly outnumbered Alliance went from cowering in cities to just becoming roaming gank monsters.
---
You can't trust or ignore anyone anymore. Alliance I always would have left alone are threats you'd be insane to let live, like allowing a rabid animal to make a home near yours. People went from primarily ignoring each other on the road to camping each other in graveyards after they spirit rezzed.
---
That's classic and that was vanilla as well, if you don't like it, the unsub is the right way. Alternatively, level an alt.
---
Yah, these toxic pirated server people are the fucking worst.   Like 4chan
---
I've tried out their tactics like FP farming and main city farming. FP farming gets boring insanely quick and if you don't have a constant influx of new people you're just spawn camping whoever you already killed 5 times.
---
And main city farming is a lot harder for alliance because of the guards that we don't have.
---
So I stopped doing these. *Nobody*, not even the system, is forcing me to play that way. I actively didn't play PvP for a week and just killed people who were in my way to dungeons or raids. I gained an entire rank that week.
---
There's no excuse for the way they played. I know there's nothing Blizz will do, so I'm glad I was able to transfer before they closed it. It's just a shame that we were forced to leave our home server. But as I said, I hope they enjoy their PvE server and BG queues.
---
No thanks, thrall
---
You did not even read half of it
---
Yes but now he just plays casual games
---
That's bullshit.  From what you're saying it means that cheating is OK too, because it's the devs job to control or fix it.   So let's all cheat! Forget about "fair play", who cares about being nice, let's just see who can ruin games for other people the most. They're the true winners.
---
I have. they love me
---
the r14 stuff is stupid good
---
#bring #back #bc #nochanges
---
We, the community, have no idea what we want, we should trust blizzard more
---
If you don't understand that I think it's you who needs to learn English.
---
Open it up to pve servers?   I bet hundreds will leave the toxic af pvp servers, if they have a chance.   This is nothing like vanilla!!!
---
Milked the cow too Much
---
&gt;Leatrix Pro UI package
---
Cant find it on Curse nor website download link. Care 2 share? &lt;3
---
And now we enjoy the authentic classic experience. Oh wait, the game is massively different from vanilla. Let's help it get back to the spirit of vanilla. Oh wait
---
Well thats just not true
---
On point eith the world building, they shouldve stayed in azeroth for the most part.
---
Never had the chance to play vanilla on official, only unofficial while official bc was out on a 2k people server where only talents/bg's worked. pve was tank n spank aka no abilities so you went there with low numbers geared yourself and then lets go red is dead.
---
didn't have many problems leveling there. pvp was lit but no death squads
---
Major contributing factors in my opinion.
---
- Less overall population
---
- Cross faction chat
---
- battlegrounds
---
I think they fucked up with to few servers when bg's are gonna be cross server. But well never know for sure. Curious how the subs gonna be once bg's hit.
---
As for blizzards plan i think they expected X% to quit and populated servers accordingly with layering. And miscalculated.
---
No dude. You can't start changing in game small mechanics like spells.
---
You are absolutely pathetic.
---
so 1.1g?
---
Do you really want to run around in your own faction city without interacting with the horde at all? Also when you port/HS/fly back from a contested zone you're still flagged for a couple of minutes.
---
So I was thinking I wanted to make a 29 healing pally battleground twink, but I can't decide if I should spec into consecration or blessing of kings. I'm Horde so I know literally nothing about pally.
---
I am pretty sure the “phases” in this post are pvp phases and they are not strictly related to the pve phases.
---
Might be wrong tho.
---
for a stun locking rogue it most certainly is
---
Oh sorry wrong faction
---
&gt; due to the sunk cost fallacy.
---
This is not a sunk cost fallacy.  If the choice is to reroll or quit, then a lot of people, maybe most people, will just quit.  Also, leveling in this game sucks ass, and people are tired of running the 5 man dungeons.
---
Crocodile Dundee here.
---
Half the bastards that act the keyboard warrior can't even maintain eye contact in real life nevermind nevermind speak in public or wash hahaha
---
In the span of 3 months Blizzard  managed to reinvent WoW with the addition  of classic and inspire millions to subscribe and play the game, followed swiftly by the abomination that is this honor system  in our day and age of pure scumbaggery....
---
Blizzard  should have reacted better  and faster, and already  working  on a permanent  solution  to the mess that has made thousands of players to leave the game.... 
---
shambolic....
---
10/10 best answer
---
I have behaved like this and its probably because its just a video game. I dont face the emotional need when talking with people online unlike in video games, of course they are people but dont take what other people say to you seriously. Im not toxic anymore (being perma banned on league) and i see the benifits of not being toxic and letting it ruinning my daybwith negativity, but its still a game and shouldnt be looked as inhuman.
---
I mean if a game has no anti cheat and everyone is running around invincible or something then yeah that's the dev's fault
---
This honestly makes me want to roll as Alliance on this server. Yes I said it.  Yes I would level as rogue I would get ganked alot. The only problem is at 60 finding a group for anything to get geared. I hope they own free allance transfers into this server.
---
Me and a Buddy have a Casino in goldshire. You can bet on anything, dueling matches, /roll, we opened Sports betting for people.  We run a lottery every Sunday. It’s a lot of fun to RP these things
---
I'm glad those guilds are doing well.
---
Probably doesn't do much for the other 98% of the Alliance there.
---
i mean, come on. DBM is utterly useless in MC , given you have a set of functional eyes.
---
It’s really throwing me off that they’re shaking with the left hand.
---
A 60-40 server still has 2 players of one faction for every 1 on the other. When you then multiply the entire population of a vanilla server by several folds and remove layering you become perpetually aware of this imbalance. Eventually the underrepresented faction avoids contested areas and stick to towns, with the exception of the hardcore rankers who are constantly moving in the deathballs you describe. Then when those towns are unsafe they stick to their capitols, the only place they can unflag. Then when they realize there’s nothing to do they log out. Repeat this cycle enough and those players stop logging in entirely.
---
Why not? It's killing the game to not do it.
---
&gt; Humans are a plague on the planet
---
This is such a bullshit motto. I hear it all the time.
---
No, the planet is a big inanimate rock with a bit of water, nitrogen and oxygen on the surface. Where life evolved, and human life too. 'the planet' is nothing special. We are special, we are the dominant species, we are complex life and the top of every tree on the planet. Could we do a better job at being apex? yes. Are we a plague? no. a plague to what? to the rock we live on?
---
Or maybe give players an option to change continents without flagging up, or put elite goblin guards on transports. You know, like the Horde has.
---
There's way too much stuff that would have to be changed to prevent this kind of a gankfest that was visible from miles away.
---
Consecration is useless as a holy pally.
---
&gt; I am not sure if they have underestimated it, most servers are under or roughly concurrent cap even from vanilla 
---
Wrong.
---
Most servers are at 3-4 times the Vanilla capacity. When layering was removed, most servers had 3-4 or even 5 layers. And those layers were already having more than 4k players, Blizzard increasing the servers capacity (hence, the layers capacity) less than 2 weeks after release.
---
&gt; It's a literal "you think you do but you don't" being proven the hard way. 
---
Except is not, because we wanted VANILLA-LIKE population. And yes, I use caps, so you would understand it. We should have at least 300 servers today, not around 120.
---
But if Blizzard would have done that, they couldn't hide the OBVIOUS : Classic population vastly exceeds Retail. But when Classic have 120 servers, and Retail 400, and when people like you (which are uniformed) believe that current Classic servers have Vanilla-like population...well, that is it far easier (and it works) to hide that Retail is a failed model.
---
It becomes more and more obvious that Blizzard's higher ups intentionally sabotaged Classic. Yeah, they will take a small loss, but Retail brings them much more money than Classic, and not to forget, it was bringing 100% of the WoW revenue before Classic.
---
So it's not a big deal for Blizzard if Classic fails. They worst case scenario, they are back to the revenue that they had before Classic...after they cashed in 5-6 millions of new subs at Classic launch.
---
How is it shitty players being shitty? People are shitty for trying to rank up?
---
[Ironforge.pro](https://Ironforge.pro) shows Herod as 63/37 Horde.
---
I'll take data over your anecdotes.
---
The other guy is a Horde player, so the likelihood of him pretending like they didn't just win through numerical superiority is pretty high
---
Because he's trash and there's no justice in this world
---
Hmm...toxic masculinity 😏
---
What a beta
---
You can already one global people.
---
And unsub I did! I'm just feeling sad thinking of the good times I'd spent leveling is all.
---
Thank you. I think there is hope out there. I had a lot of it when the game launched. My server is somewhat healthy now and I love the community on my server, h and a (kirtonos) but nochanges is killing this game. Changes need to happen because of other changes that have happened. It doesn't mean we can't keep the spirit of vanilla alive.
---
Probably some kid trying to get him banned. Asmongold is probably the last person who would need to buy gold since everyone just give their gold to him anyways
---
1k to me just seems so far off and I do not feel like grinding mindlessly.  I did however love pvping so obtaining my rank 11 mount back then wasnt too hard.  I dont know if I'll be able to reach that high in classic
---
If loads of people did this i would alliance too just to get back at my own faction anyway i can. These fucks ruined my classic experience by forcing the alliance off Flamelash. Blizzard has alot to answer for
---
I mean a server literally just collapsed, but yah, there's no problem.   Daft doesn't cover it...
---
Blizzard banks on a large number of the classic population to play shadowlands once that releases and they will probably be right.
---
A lot of people that neglected or ignored retail will buy it now that they are invested in wow again.
---
Classic+ is a pipedream when TBC is free money and Shadowlands is nearly done.
---
So glad I left after hitting 40 after release. Horde btw
---
I flipped it horizontally during the sketch phase because I wanted to put the orc back on the left like the old school box art.
---
[Just for you though :)](https://imgur.com/vNBtCue)
---
The time investment for PVE is high enough that they should be separate buckets.
---
The only thing you got "good" at is being toxic af.
---
&gt;Probably some kid trying to get him banned
---
And yet they bothered to attach something besides gold to the message? A common trick gold sellers do to avoid detection (or so they think)
---
horde may have queue times but I dought its going to be the hour long queue times all the salty alliance players have been promising. all the PvPers that transferred to PvE realms not to mention all the people who said they would return when BGs come out so id guess 30 minute que times for horde still instant for alliance
---
15HK, i don't think level has anything to do with the pool of players.
---
Why aren’t people making level 1 characters and going to Orgrimmar to show how dead horde side is for karma?
---
I hear it’s the in thing to do at the moment.
---
Calling things toxic is cringe.  Just call him an asshole.
---
I’m not sure about that. I distinctly remember being disappointed that greens replaced naxx gear a little too quickly in TBC.
---
It's not quite as good if you min max everything with the full hit items, but it saves you a lot of time getting those last points of hit when you're a dwarf so I would definetly go for it
---
Elune-atic?
---
There absolutely were transfers in Vanilla. I know this because I moved one of my characters to another realm when I had to get a late night raid when my work schedule changed.
---
Lol, every time.
---
There can be no light without darkness.
---
That is not enough of an incentive to reroll, especially since it has been 3+ months since launch. The only thing long queues will achieve is to push players grinding for honour back into the open world which means the same problems that ruined phase 2 will persist, which will make things way worse.
---
No, this whole problem is because there's meta about farming honor. 
---
In Vanilla we didn't know what equipment was coming. No one bothered farming, like a fucking job, because there wasn't a PvP meta. 
---
The difference between Now and Then is less about populations and shit like that, and way more that meta is way different after 15 years of detailed examination. 
---
Private server players new this would happen. The only surprise here is that Blizz didn't implement better changes to avoid it happening. 
---
Source: many low pop PvP realms are still fucked.
---
Nah, as a rogue it sounds good in theory until you try to gank someone. Sure you may kill them, but 90% of the time there’s another horde player standing nearby and they come in, save the other guy and kill you. Then they use spy to camp your corpse for the next 30 minutes.
---
Unless you have thistle tea. Then you can kill someone in cheap shot and vanish before anyone blinks haha.
---
If you want to put effort sure. 
---
You really dont need anything other than 2-3 GFRP for rag (more so you make sure it dies).
---
Who gives a fuck about leveling speed once they're already 60? That would solve absolutely nothing.
---
They didn’t give it to us for a long time because they said we wouldn’t like it. Maybe they want to be proven right.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQkXXBqj\_U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQkXXBqj_U)
---
True. If they're in combat you also have to help to kill that mob before you can mount again. I usually still buff when i see someone fighting, but a lot less than lower levels because its less convenient. Buffing random people is still one of my favorite things to do.
---
I rolled rogue in preparation for this msss so i could stealth out and pick my fights, dunno how you guys do it without stealth lol.
---
6 honor per person in a 40 man raid is still 240 honor. KEK
---
Was NOT expecting that cut to corpse run laughed so loud the gf _shhhh_’ed me
---
Bornakk specifically references the pvp-pve phase parity in the second link.
---
At least initially, you always faced off against the opposite faction in arena
---
Traitors
---
Well it's kind of a dramatic term to use to put it mildly.
---
&gt; There was no transfer in Vanilla.
---
&gt; Classic has transfers.
---
Paid character transfers originally became available in mid-2006.
---
The problem is so easy to fix.  Faction queue, Faction xfers to pve servers and any alliance dominated pvp servers.
---
Hundreds of horde will xfer off just because they're sick of the toxic pvp servers!   You wouldn't even have to give them any further incentive.  Hundreds more would gladly xfer to alliance, just so they dont have to wait in BG queues.   I have friend making alts on fairbanks, because of this....
---
he went to exilecon and was up on the main stage
---
Second this. Moonkins might actually have been playable in pvp if there was **any** leather gear to actually support them.
---
doesn't really matter if players are toxic if the factions are balanced...  then both sides get camped, get ganked, about equally. the problem is faction imbalance caused by blizzard's incompetence.
---
how exactly are they not better than raiding gear?
---
What an original and unique post
---
&gt;I support this discussion 100%. People are complaining about too many “whining” posts. Initially these same people said “there’s no problem,” then it was “you knew what you signed up for,” and now that everyone is willing to admit that this is a serious issue for the game’s longevity they immediately shoot down any suggestions about how to address these problems from the player base as not worth trying.
---
Cough, climate Change, cough.
---
Wait, how do you know he has two accounts?
---
They need to implement one-way faction changes on the poorly balanced servers. Let the servers attempt to equalize internally, then if necessary,  allow one faction to transfer to the realm to fill the gap. It needs to be a automated system with a manageable population cap in mind.
---
You obviously have no clue what you are talking about: just as increasing the amount of layers on server increases its concurrent cap, the removal of layers on server reduces its concurrent cap. So delayering resulted in server cap being reduced accordingly. 
---
&gt;When layering was removed, most servers had 3-4 or even 5 layers.
---
This is a blatant lie. How about you show a source for that statement huh?
---
&gt;Most servers are at 3-4 times the Vanilla capacity.
---
Name me a server not listed in the Blizzard warnings to transfer out, then we'll talk using that specific example.
---
Yeah well i meant from the start. There should have been stuff like that in the beginning helping people to make balanced servers.
---
I came from a private server, and in most launches, the honor system was already there, but it never effected the game like this, I really think the population of servers is really to blame, there's just to many people on streamer realms.
---
His bitching about wpvp is because he gets shit on. He talked a lot about how his stream will control everything, and then when they get steamrolled he quits.
---
This would literally do nothing dude.... It's much too late for this to do anything.
---
Yeah, exactly. The top guild will just funnel mats through neutral AH, and it won’t be a problem. Or they’ll sell it for cheap to whatever few Alliance guilds are left.
---
Can't whisper some one of the opposite faction on a pvp server without another account. So this dude actually logged onto a separate wow account just to send these messages...
---
imagine actually believing that a guy that gets showered in gold every time he logs in would buy gold and risk ruining his reputation
---
Blizz is so fucking happy that there is this much attention in classic good or bad. Shadowlands is going to get so much free press which is all Classic was for anyway.
---
What? TBC will be very popular and very profitable for Blizzard. Minimum effort for lots of $$$$. They would be fools not to release TBC
---
It takes time to travel, so even if they are min maxing to get an extra kill in, they still gotta fly to get there. They’ll also be instanced into BGs eventually pulling them out of the world. There will be a lot less people in the world PvPing. It’s seeming like there’s a 65/35 Horde/Alliance split across everything, so I can’t imagine Horde queue times being so long they are able to roam and gank at the level that is happening right now.
---
Useless is harsh. It creates a zone that destealths.
---
Because hunters have a quest at 60 where they need to fight 4 demons in the open world to get rhok'delar and lok'delar (bow and staff). They have to fight them 1v1. Not even pets allowed. If anyone tries to help in any way during the fight, the demon will instantly despawn. There's something similar for priests in epl (to get benediction), but most people don't even go there, so it's not as bad.
---
He wouldnt risk it in the slightest to buy gold from goldselling sites
---
Its not accurate for overall population numbers, but unless you can provide me a rational reason that one faction is more inclined to log raids than the other, I'm going to trust it for population ratios.
---
Buddy.
---
If its a gross amount your going to get screwed as Blizzard looks for flags. (Were talking over 1k). 
---
If you getting some 200-300 your fine as most places make it seem like you sold something to them for x gold.
---
While still questionable, its harder for them to get you dead to rights.
---
Lol I fucking died when he came hauling ass right by you.
---
OK, I was being dramatic by mentioning cheating.  My point is that games are supposed to be fun for everyone and people need to remember that.  I don't see how you can justify ruining the experience that other people are having, to the point that a lot of players have stopped playing until BG comes out. 
---
Clearly we have different opinions which is fine, but I don't think you can throw moral values out the window just because the opportunity allows you to do so.
---
0.3% and it's only 13k for everyone in that bracket if they perfectly stack the same honor, else it'll go down based on the honor difference between them and the person with the highest honor
---
&gt; Nobody will want to transfer to a server where the opposing faction is doing to you what you have been doing to them on your current server - queue or no queue.
---
Yah, that will.  Lots of people will do it for the shorter BG queues.   Others will do it, to get to a pve server.   Finally, the queue will give even more people incentive to leave.
---
&gt;Yeh not sure how many honor points killing a level 1 gives...
---
Or if killing alliances again and again is even honorfull, like the word honor itself is not what it used to be
---
Left hand shake
---
You need to report that guy.
---
TIL, thank you!
---
This is the type of dude who will kill an afk player, and then proceed to spam go back to retail
---
&gt;You forgot: Ït's PvP on a PvP server! Should have picked PvE if you didnt want that.
---
Thats just stupid
---
Devs can control what players do.  They can put faction queue's in and force transfters that way.  They could have put caps on server populations.  They could have rolled out phases in a better time line.  They had 15 years of data to make this smooth, and completely dropped the ball on all of it.
---
This is shitty game design more than it is anything else.
---
But.. it is largely Blizzard's fault. I don't really know how anyone can say otherwise. Yeah people are shitty, but that's why you have systems that don't encourage and reward that type of behaviour. That's why you do the best you can to ensure population balance.
---
Blizzard did none of that and it's lead to players taking advantage, which sucks but the root cause is still Blizzard. And a massive company with years and years of MMO experience doesn't really need people defending their crappy decisions. 
---
Also just in case anyone thinks so.. I don't play anymore and didn't like PVP when I did, so I'm not some camping arsehole trying to defend myself.
---
Resilience was a strain on the PvP system but it was a needed addition the way itemization scaled.
---
Def 45-60. Was able to beat out a camper cuz he logged in late for one and I happened to be there.
---
Fair point. I rescind from useless to situational.
---
You trolling or are you really that dumb?
---
Everyone’s saying death wish but this is the real one they would shut down so many encounters. 5 second fucking stun!
---
please, blizzard is infallible. it's the players' fault. us players should have had the foresight to perfectly sort ourselves out and ensure balanced faction ratios on every server before we levelled our characters to 60. but we didn't, and ended up with imbalanced servers. at this point us horde should have all come up with a gentleman's agreement to just play nice and not pvp the alliance too much despite all the rewards and incentives. but we didn't. it's our own fault.
---
There wouldn't be enough Taurens on PvE servers to /moo at, making the game as good as dead.
---
Coming from a horde on that server, they did exactly the same to us, and more. We just did it better
---
Not anymore. 
---
Unless your server has zero comp for it. 
---
That boat has sailed!
---
i got rabk 10 back in the day on a couple chara and didn’t think it was too bad. idk. but i am worried it’a going to be worse in classic because the populations are so much higher. we’ll see.
---
Some people are just like that, doesnt matter how good things go for them, there is always a reason to find fault and winge
---
Since your a horde player I wholeheartedly approve :)
---
Except he didn't even seem to flinch...
---
Why would he be permanently banned?
---
You won't have to play 8hrs a day for only the 5th highest bracket though, unless you just get shit honor (and I mean REALLY shit)
---
50% more isn't a big deal with it's 2v3. It's a big deal with it means the enemy team has literally thousands more players than you. Yes, math is funny.
---
"We tried nothing and even that didn't work!" -blizzard
---
You're actually a dumb.
---
I believe the expression is “it’s gonna be a shitshow”.
---
You’re next. How bout that?
---
I'm that case, everyone has a screw loose.
---
Hope he gets permabanned. I'm all for banter but he crossed a line that can never be justified. 
---
Can't even imagine how big of a loser you have to be to act like this over fucking WoW pvp.
---
As the other guy side it doesnt happen that often. I played WoW for a few years between vanilla, tbc and wotlk. In that time I can only remember of one instance where I encountered some major toxicity
---
If I was a GM, and read this trash, I would permaban this loser.   Holy shit!  Too bad, nothing will likely happen to them, because blizzard isn't investing a fucking dime of our sub fee into this game.
---
Dude. You should reroll mathclasses. You have no idea how percentages work.
---
Not defending the toxicity but I willing to bit OP is psalms alliance druid on herod and he is a literal piece of shit.
---
I am pretty damn sure anyone blaming blizzard for players griefing, are the griefing players trying to displace blame anonymously.  If not that I can't think of any other reason for blaming blizzard for what people do by choice, no one is forcing these clowns to do this.
---
No... they exist to show you what the best gear is for your spec/role 
---
“Thinking for yourself” your come up with the same shit on a bis list after 3 days of research
---
God I hate care bears
---
So you've never been toxic in a game, ever?  Got it.
---
Yeah, his was a bit extreme.
---
Every statistic I've seen has indicated that horde/ally are balanced across all servers. Here are the last 7 days' stats for lvl60s, it's 50-50.  [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;minLevel=60](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;minLevel=60)
---
This is a competitive game, though. You don't have to be on a PVP server. When a football team wins 54-0 is it morally wrong? 
---
 I agree that this bad and not how wow should be at all, but I can't blame the players, because they're just playing the game competitively and not breaking any rules. People are going to be toxic in advantage situations, it's just human nature at this point, and the devs are lazy to not see it coming
---
Ah, memories. What was that youtube account again? I remember the little brother uploading tons. There was always a huge debate whether it was staged or not.
---
Pve servers will get aq well before them ... This is less than a pve server. This is a crippled server.
---
 [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;minLevel=60](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;minLevel=60)  50-50 split for the last seven days.
---
Horde here in Mograine. Think it's great and I really hope it stays this way. 
---
I think Mograine really shows that even though the ratio is good, some people are toxic af. Usually it's fine but at times I have been ganked 10-15 times to enter DM by groups of more than 10 people, and as they should know I am not worth any honor by that point. I have also seen horde ganking Thorium Point for hours, even people with res sickness, lvl 45s etc. P2 opened the flood gates to toxic behavior between factions.
---
You know a 65/35 split is like 2.5:1 ratio, right?
---
Horde queues are gonna be long. Like, 30+ minute long, probably. Ample time to fly from Undercity to W/EPL, from Org to Azshara, TB to Un'goro or Feralas. Or they can set hearths to Kargath to camp BRM and TP.
---
People who want to min/max honor (which seems to be the majority) will be supplementing honor from BGs with ganking due to long queue times. You're seriously overestimating travel times and underestimating the likely queues.
---
Not really, no. If I get pissed off in a game I just walk away instead of exploding at the other players.
---
Yeah but thats just the incoming damage, dying doesn't add extra durability loss afaik.
---
It is normal though, the anonymity effect is a real thing, and anyone who says they've never been rude online is lying, or has some thing that stops them getting emotionally invested in a game.
---
Its a mace and not as cool 🤣
---
Weapon is solid. Just on of the overlooked gems.
---
Anonymity effect is a real thing.
---
^(Too true, and they have the nerve to blame blizzard too.)
---
Not too late. 
---
Its not too late untill last week before TBC expansion that might never come.
---
One of good things with Vanilla / Classic WoW is catch-up mechanics and raid itemization.
---
Basically with most new content phases comes new ways to get decent gear faster. 
---
We already got Diremaul instance.
---
We got PVP gear (also good for PVE) and soon we get Battlegrounds that lets you rank for PVP in early levels.
---
In Phase 4 we get 20 man ZG raid and new profession gear.
---
Phase 5 we get 20 man AQ raid and new profession items.
---
In Phase 6 we get new bosses and gear in low level dungeons and new 0.5 tier set.
---
Also unlike in Retail WoW gear jumps in raid dungeons are smaller, so people keep farming first tier of raids every week untill the end of Classic.
---
Potentially
---
Good meme, bad caption.
---
Thank you guys , appreciate it ^^
---
Okay. That seems a little excessive.
---
Interesting, so, what is your Plan B?
---
I can only assume you have a Plan B, because you didn't write this post without considering the possibility that even on a 50/50 server, horde would still be more pvp oriented and likely cause more misery to the alliance than alliance would to horde.
---
I mean, that's where the entire problem stems from.
---
I want to play a 15 year old game exactly as it was!
---
I am mad that they have not changed the 15 year old game to suit my new needs!!!
---
Blizz didn't open a million servers at the start because they were afraid people would quit after the initial fun factor worse off, leaving us with many, many empty servers. Not really much of an improvement over what we have now, really. But still, it was extremely stupid of them to allow more than maybe 5k(which would be already more than vanilla) people per server.
---
Am I weird as shit?  Before phase 2, my goal wasy to get on a server wher I could play horde, but was slightly under represented on the server.   This was an attempt to, eventually, end up in a position to have some fast battleground queues.  But it looks like things have gone a bit shit for that to happen.
---
That's not an attachment...
---
https://m.imgur.com/t/reaction/KYLhc
---
It's funny that you think it's possible to find 1v1s in the game's current state.
---
Even funnier that you think all fights should be equal numbers on both sides in an MMO of all things.
---
Oh, I'm not sold on the notion of creating more PVP realms tbh. I think just changing (significantly) unbalanced servers to PVE is all that's needed. Sucks for those that wanted world pvp, but it's better than the current debacle.
---
The way to do it could be to give every player with a  level 40+ character on the server who is in the disadvantaged faction a vote on whether it goes PVE.  Give them a week to vote and if most of them want PVE, bam it goes PVE. Issue sorted.
---
I don't think it's a question of smart vs. lazy.  I remember in their promo videos they talked about wanting to make a "museum piece".  So their *goal* was to build the museum piece, and they more or less succeeded in that.
---
If the PvP servers are becoming completely one-sided as a result, one so far but I think there's several others not far behind, and in time I suspect all of them will if something isn't done, well, that's a consequence of Classic being a "museum piece".  You can still get the "original" experience of starting in patch 1.12 if you start on a PvE server.
---
How bad does *Blizzard* think it is when one faction ends on a PvP server?  The PvE servers are fine.  For people on the majority factions on the one-sided PvP servers, well they can PvE in the open world and get their PvP in battlegrounds.
---
Some people are leaving, well people were always going to leave an 15-year old museum piece sooner or later.  It's inherent to the "museum piece" philosophy.
---
So are Blizzard's managers going to think this is a problem?
---
I'd love to have an OSRS-like version of vanilla WoW.  I love parts of vanilla WoW, but other parts... need improvement, and I'd like to see new content, too.  But the more I listen to Blizzard talk, the less I think they're interested in that.  Their vision seems to be this next expansion of BfA where you can level alts in a gutted version of the Classic world, with BfA characters and rules, until you're forced into the latest expansion from levels 50-60.
---
Oh, suppose a couple of years from now they launch #nochanges Burning Crusade.  I'm guessing that after this experience all the #nochange BC PvP servers will be Alliance-dead from day 1.
---
The saddest part is that it’s 2019, not 2005.  That other player probably isn’t a kid - they are probably a grown ass adult that not only talked trash in that manner, but then escalated it.  Very pathetic.
---
What do you want him to do? Convince all the other campers to not camp IF? Leave the open world so that the 10% alliance can quest? What consequence of his actions are you talking about, what can he do to fix the situation?
---
I played BC and the "Everyone is in Shattrah" is false.
---
Ironforge was packed and so was Orgrimmar
---
Actually, I would have done that.  Still a dumb idea though.
---
250g for an epic is very reasonable.
---
What’s the point of rank14 on a dead server?
---
OH good stop with the population size bullshit...
---
Good luck in that dead server of yours.
---
Definitely not a bad post whatsoever, but trying to conclude on whether or not BGs will our saving grace when their launch is only *three days away* seems silly. 
---
In any case, the launch of BGs will change up (not necessarily solve!) some of the current issues we are facing right now, so the best course of action from there will inevitably change as well.
---
Wait just three days before doing anything drastic.
---
There is a big, fat line between getting invested in a game/getting mad at a teammate and telling people their family should die, linking suicide prevention macros, hoping they get cancer and spending over a minute going off on someone for no reason. It is not 'a bit extreme' and it is not a normal thing to do. You shouldn't be playing games if they make you do this shit.
---
That site is very, very wonky and changes day by day. There are days where it shows Stalagg ass being majority Alliance.
---
For example, right now it says that the majority of 60s on Whitemane are Alliance. Thats...just not true.
---
I would.  My friends would.   Faster BG queues, and easier time to rank up.
---
You are wrong.
---
Unfortunately, extremism like this is very common in people in general.  It doesn't take a mental disorder to be convinced that saying this sort of thing is ok.
---
It's similar to terrorist groups - when people around you all do something, you're more likely to do it too.
---
It is really not what they implied at all. Is this actually a matter of reading comprehension being too poor?
---
They are trying to make banter by saying the person they are harassing must surely be so devastated about their loss, that they are *hoping they wont kill themselves*.
---
They are not implying what you say. They are outright saying the contrary.
---
And they are not even at fault. This is Blizzard‘s making. Who on earth thought it was a good idea that I could add random strangers from the opposite faction as friends? **There is a reason they can‘t send them messages to begin with**.
---
This should not even result in a 48h mute. Blizzard‘s policy on this is that you can put them on your ignore list. The person harassing does not seem to be breaking ToS.
---
We should definitely just not participate in literally the only system we have available to us. lmao wut.
---
and force other people to do the same even though they're perfectly fine at the moment. gotcha
---
Dozens of active players is a lot.   It's a 2 person swing too, because not only is the horde losing a player, but the alliance is gaining one.
---
Im happy he stuck on a dead server.
---
The point was to fight more evenly instead of the massive gank squads that are running around now but I suppose that went over your head didn't it and the game wouldn't be in its current state if those gank squads hadn't driven off half the player base.
---
But you do you, keep working on your rank I don't give a toss I'm on a pve server.
---
I don't know where I said he's dumb. Also it does not stack.
---
The honour system *without bgs* encourages this behaviour.  Which is why blizz should never have released the honour system without bgs.
---
How does it work in modern wow?
---
Except he didnt?
---
Dude it’s like 60/40 horde
---
it has a cooldown, so you have to set up a rotation. i’ll get the first one, you get the second one, he gets the third one...but it works.
---
The only use for rend at 60 is versus rogues right? Was in ony yesterday and i seen the 2 tanks put rend on her.
---
mouseclicking the trinket, fucking disgusting video
---
Threes videos really helped me. I don’t have the means to scout but I’ve gotten my routes down pat and probably netted about 100 Lotus on my medium pop server over the last 2 months when I feel like farming. Also thank you for mentioning the spawn time change it was really fucking me up the past few days.
---
Im not saying its not a feature or expected in some degree .Im just saying the argument that they re griefing for honor is not valid and thats what is demonstrated on this video.
---
Just curious, did you say they were "purposely not letting people play" when they started removing layers even though that was causing queues?
---
Cant wait for the salt here. Brillant picture
---
Say enough people think RBGs are a good idea. #Nochanges becomes #somechanges and all the usual underperformers in PVE think they deserve a piece of the pie too after 15 years.  
---
They don't ask for much, just a few minor tweaks and changes. Just give nature spells 10% less mana cost and now ele shaman are a legitimate DPS spec in PVE. But what happens to PVP when ele/resto shamans can sustain a lot more burst output and still have mana leftover for cleansing, dropping totems and healing their teammates.
---
There's nothing wrong with wanting to even the playing field but we all have a million differing opinions on how to make it a better game and the honor system is probably the easiest fix out there idea wise because RBGs are a proven concept. But how are we as players supposed to agree on anything when the playerbase is split between two multiple stances, all of which are probably quite reasonable.
---
Lol are you mad or you just don't understand the situation? If I want to xfer off a shitty unbalanced realm and you're holding me hostage because you don't want your faction balance to get worse, I'm just going to fucking quit the game. That leaves you with one less player on your server, so the SAME outcome as if I xfered, AND I don't play anymore. So you lose a server pop and blizz loses a sub and I lose a game I like to play. It's lose/lose/lose your way. If you let me jump ship at least I still get to play the game, and blizz keeps a customer. So my solution is win/win/lose, essentially significantly better of an outcome as making me rot on a dead server.
---
Shit like this makes me wanna quit the game just so I can't be counted in the same group as these people. (the two commenters and the sweaty player pm'ing)
---
Yeah rending in a raid environment is a big no no. It uses up valuable debuff slots.
---
What the fuck kind of strawman is that? He doesn't demand perfect server balance, he complains that Blizz is doing their best to fuck it up even more by allowing the lower faction to transfer off.
---
Yeah, they'll get it... eventually. Likely several months behind balanced, or more populated servers. Remember; the Horde cannot make alts to fix this. PvP servers do not allow you to play alts of different factions. You're also putting too much faith in the toxic community that is the Horde to let the Alliance try to supply their end of the War Effort.
---
Yeah but honestly I think there’s a lot of people waiting for bgs on alliance pvp server factions right now.  Like it seems pretty pointless to subject yourself to the zergfest too much when bgs are right around the corner.  I know a fair few alliance players on mograine who’ve just been leveling lowbie alts n shit and raid logging their mains waiting for bgs.
---
But people wanted vanilla so they got vanilla.
---
Another idiot without the basic understanding of economics trying to farm karma from other idiots, nothing to see here.
---
Hes obviously an ironman, btw
---
Amen. My guild who had almost completed Naxx prior to TBC fell apart in TBC. Our personal lives were changing but the way the game was changing def made us stepping away easier
---
Making the server have 5-7 times the capacity because they don't realize Classic will be popular **is** a change.
---
I mean, you can always make an alt.
---
I just want to get HKs why you have to be mad?
---
I can count the number of times alliance has controlled Brm on mograine on one hand over the last month.
---
Rushing to 60 burned me out from leveling for a while.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahah
---
We use LC. 
---
They took inputs from all the raiders and made the list for us to talk with and agree to. 
---
Items like this were designated as caster 2 drops /healer 1. So out of every 3, 2 would go to dps/1 healer. Dont ask me why, Im a simple hunter and voted that we get 1h after other melee dps cuz they benefit more from it. 
---
We track this on google docs and its visible to all. So very little loot drama happens over stuff as the healer mafia has an internal list there rep on LC uses to say who is next in line. Same for caster dps on this and mageblade. 
---
Low drama/lots of fun.
---
TBC also make the faction imbalance even worse. The inclusion of blood elves attracted a TON of people who disliked being horde because of the lack of beautiful character, and they were even the best paladins in the game, and paladin was THE thing that helped alliance to keep their head afloat
---
Census is 60/40
---
&gt; This is a blatant lie. How about you show a source for that statement huh?
---
Before layering was active Blizzard said that a server at "low" had the amount of players of a "full" vanilla server. Just stfu if you don't have a clue.
---
No, it’s 60/40
---
Which doesn’t mean shit
---
Well that is a good sign then. The pictures make it seem like there is literally no one.
---
That's  what the CEO of EA would call - surprise mechanics .
---
who cares
---
&gt; But where we would that leave us down the line is with underpopulated servers that we have to start looking at merging or offering transfers from them to other servers to get back down in population. That's tremendously disruptive to communities and something we really, really, really want to avoid.
---
But instead they have to offer transfers from servers that are too full to servers that are relatively low, fucking up faction balance in the mean time. Apparently this isn't disruptive and something they really, really, really want to avoid. Well done.
---
What's a good EU PVE server to roll on?
---
Don’t hate the player, hate the game.
---
For the love of green Jesus its RMP😡
---
&gt;The honor system isn't FORCING you to be toxic sociopaths! 
---
If you want to rank it does
---
Man that's good.
---
Oh sure I forgot, these people are your property for honor points forming, for even trying to finish their leveling or seeing any other hi-end content.
---
Majority of people won't reroll. Ever. They'll just stop playing.
---
if you list copper bars as singles, there is no listing fee.
---
That's actually the process I had in mind.
---
That wouldn't be vanilla though.
---
We wanted an 15 year old game, imperfect as it was.
---
Stop whining.
---
no, I'm saying I'd rather the solution be done with a brain and a scalpel and not a blind raging wow nerd with a cleaver
---
it would be more effective to offer specific servers to transfer to specific servers and only certain factions to do the same. to make them as equal as possible. westfall has like 70/30 alliance, stallag has like 65/35 horde, you offer alliance from wesfall to go to stallag and horde from stallag to go to wesfall. that's a better solution imo. it may not even work, but it would be the best way right now. if players choose to not change, then allow more broad transfers. 
---
honestly the only people I would want to hold hostage are those that ruined their server by griefing, they should have to start over and abandon their characters - perhaps they'll play with a little restraint in the future if they do
---
Days before they removed layering, most of the realms already didn't have layers, only the bigger ones had 2. Ppl don't remember that? It's not that long ago.
---
Time for them shadow bolt spams!!!!
---
Oh dont forget you get to summon all the late folks. 🤣
---
No, it doesn't...  Rank a little slower?
---
Blame the no changes crowd.  You can't have it both ways.  But even then people would have complained.
---
Such a dispeptic fanbase.
---
Classic has turned into a huge ultra fry hard call of duty Xbox live fuck boi fest
---
ReRoLl tO PvE
---
Hej Said he already farmed devilsaur, and with the way HS functions there is no argument to pick voones over ommoks anymore.
---
To OP: prio number one would be to get your Epic mount, after that lionheart (if on pve server you can do it in any order) If you are not human/orc edgemasters is THE biggest upgrade to your damage outside of weapon upgrades and are without a doubt worthwhile to break your devilsaur set bonus for.
---
Just quit. Snore.
---
But they did them by drasticly increasing reamp pop cap.
---
These bots have been going for DAYS will multiple reports from different people.  Full conversations were had in /1 about them and nothing is done.  The fact I have to fly out to Azshara, track them down and report them rather just creating a ticket about them is equally as stupid.  It is almost as if Blizzard wants bots in their game with as lackadaisical as they are stopping bots.
---
Very rarely does this happen.  I’ve been farming brd on a mage alt and searing gorge, Brm and steppes are horde served to fuck 95% of the time.  Was literally there on my main pvping in an 8 man last night to try it out and see if it was still Zergy and after 5 mins we were rolled by 35 horde in a big Zerg (numbers according to spy).  Naturally we left the area as we have done most of the time because there’s just so many horde here.  Went to feralas and had a few decent reasonably balanced fights until yet again rolled by 30 horde.
---
Alliance pvp is pretty much, get as many kills as you can before you inevitably get rolled by the 3-4 30-40 man horde zergs roaming steppes/feralas/epl/winter spring.  And no, alliance don’t have those kinds of numbers in each zone as horde does typically.
---
Nice
---
Also if blizzard hadn't put in the overpowered 1.12 PvP weapons/gear that's bis until AQ/Naxx for some classes there would be much less incentive.
---
Both factions have gank squads running around now. How does that fit into your narrative?
---
Enjoy your PvE server. P2 has been a blast for me.
---
Then you and your friend will have to look for a server where the faction you want to play is unlocked or wait for the faction you want to play on the server you want to play is unlocked.
---
With a similar system, many people who do not care about the faction would have chosen the opposite faction, if they were locked on the server they want to play and would have maintained the health of most servers in 60/40.

Opt in pvp is not the same though is it.  There’s no danger involved here, you feel nothing going to epl to do a quest or stv to level up.  There’s zero risk involved in going anywhere in the game world.  That’s a huge part of the game completely neutered.
---
Because blizzard doesn't care.
---
Each one of those is money in the bank. They Ban them every 6-12 months so they can bump the profits up.

I remember seeing bits in scholazar basin in wotlk that were there running routes for almost 2 years.

Why would Spy help you corpse camp a Rogue?

Yeah that makes total sense... Arms is aoe dmg, fury is for single target dmg... if he wanted to use 2h for raid and still do good dmg he could've/should've stuck with fury. There are talent builds you can find for fury 2h on classic wowhead dps warrior guide.
---
Almost as if they ban botting programs in waves so the botting devs just doesn't alter the code after noticing a few bans
---
Keep given it to me daddy
---
When someone says "stats", they mean raw attributes such as stamina and intellect, things any mage would prefer over 10 frost resist and a gimmicky proc that is heavily outclassed by frostbite. I stated that it's great for pve mages. That was the discussion. Whether it was best for pve dps on a mage or if its it's a good pvp ring. Imo it is not good for pvp as it has no raw stats. Can you wear it? Sure. Is the price/value going to increase because bg's release? I seriously doubt it.
---
Spirit is a really good stat while leveling - lets you regenerate mana more often. Most of my healing gear was int/spirit.
---
Here are a couple of next-level things -- maybe you don't have to worry about it right away, I don't know:
---
1) your spirit regenerates mana only if you haven't spent mana in the past 5 seconds. So, if you are down some mana and the tank is not taking damage very quickly, you can wait until the he is lower on health and then do a big heal to top him off, then a renew so you can wait longer again...then wait as long as you can and do it again ... this way you will be getting some regen between casts. Whereas if you are constantly casting, you will never get any spirit regen because you never waited more than 5 seconds. (sometimes you have to be constantly casting, like if multiple people have aggro, or if the tank is dying really fast. But do what you can.)
---
2) You can still use your lower ranked heals after you learn a new higher rank. They're useful in some situations because they cost less mana and heal less. e.g. sometimes a mage will have half as much HP as the tank does, and if you use your new rank of heal on him it will be way too much wasted overheal. In that case you can use a lower rank. I keep 3 or 4 ranks of my big heal on my hotbar for this reason.
---
3. a lot of healers want to put a shield or a renew on the tank right before he pulls, since this will sort of buffer the damage he takes right away and give you time to react. it seems reasonable. but actually this is not a good idea. (a) the shield is bad on warrior and druid tanks because it prevents them from getting rage from taking damage. No rage means they can't use their abilities to build aggro, which is bad. (I guess it would be OK to pre-shield a paladin or shaman tank.) (b) the renew tick will point aggro toward you immediately, before the tank has had much time to build threat on the monsters. So -- don't do that...just wait for him to get hit for a while (e.g. until there is enough space in his health bar for your biggest heal), then hit him with that.
---
4) I think that your big heal is your most efficient one, as long as it doesn't overheal. flash heal and renew and shield are not as efficient, so generally don't use those unless you need to in order to keep somebody alive (e.g. if the tank is taking a lot of damage, putting a renew on will make it easier to keep him up...if a mage gets aggro, a shield or flash heal might be fast enough to save him whereas maybe a lower-rank-big-heal would be too slow, etc. They are all good tools for different situations...i am not saying not to use them. But just to keep in mind that your different heals have different mana efficiencies, and generally your big heal is the most efficient (plus if you do it right you will get more time to regen as in (1), making it even more efficient).
---
Good luck!
---
Imagine actually paying more money to gank what few players there are left keeping your server alive, just so you can pretend rank 14 firsts matter - 15 years after rank 14 firsts.
---
I like this server, although is 75% alliance. So if you come here, please go horde and help balance things!
---
Flying impacted the questing and travel experience in a negative way. The flying gripes are about more than wPvP.
---
But don’t most servers gets a sharded together so it’s almost like a natural battle group?
---
no flying? in vanilla u still have chance to win against pvp geared person as pve, not so much with resilience stuff around, always hated it, itemization where epics from heroics end bosses were worse than blues which was saw when gearscore arrived as they had for some reason just worse stats than blues, tier 5.5 for daily heroics in sunwell patch, many dailes introduced, thanks but no thanks
---
It’s 4 kills, -25% a kill
---
Can we not just add log in queues to Horde characters? 
---
If it’s not Ballenced they can not log in on that Horde char.
---
i would put 1 or 2 lower rank big heals on my bar, just for the purpose of not overhealing people who have tiny health bars (mages, etc). But you can come back to that later if you want.
---
This is a serious post?
---
You think getting rank 14 gear a month earlier is worthless? I'd be willing to guess a ton of people will give a fuck about getting there before anyone else. There's little else to achieve in Classic than to progress through the content early.
---
Nevertheless, what he said is how honor grinders operate right now. You trying to rationalize not grinding honor yet doesn't change it.
---
I understand how serious the issue is for PvP, but I wouldn't boil down "the state of the class" to a macro that doesn't work like it should.  Lots of people are playing hunters, and lots of people are having a blast.  Your gripe about the macro not working like it should is valid - but your 2 month "break" from the game, and "state of the class" trope is quite over dramatic.
---
If FD trap was one single ability that blizzard gave to hunters, then they'd be on the hook to fix it and ensure that it's always working properly.  But since the macro produces an effect that likely was not intended by blizzard, then it is contingent upon the player to modify the macro so it works in the way desired (if possible).  I understand that the macro worked in vanilla, and now that we are on the modern client with simulated spell batching things don't work the same.  I don't think it's blizzards responsibility to make sure our old macros can work in the same way they used to.
---
i would
---
That makes so much sense!
---
I did that to hover over so people could see it. Not everyone knows every item in the game.
---
ooh yeah this is good -- use fade. Priests have so many tools -- really the luxury model healing class!
---
The fact that "every time you go to your capital just AFK for 5 minutes and then run back to your body" is being legitimately offered as a solution to PVP issues really highlights how absurd this whole issue is.
---
It was rough, but the truth is that 40m raids had to go.
---
Putting aside how restrictive they are from a logistical point of view, 40m is simply too much of a size to make raids that actually put pressure on the performance of every raid member with tightly tuned fights. 25m was a much more manageable raid size that still offered the "large raid" feel while putting more responsibility on each raid member - thus allowing better raids to be created.

You don’t have to win to get rewards. Catch any of the 3 rare fish to get the 3 rewards most are looking for
---
It would be necessary to close the realm with too much difference to force the players to change.
---
In parallel blizzard must authorize the change of faction and limit the population differences to ~ 2%.
---
I never said you had to do that either. My comments apply to both sides. Just don't run around in gank squads. Or if you do want to run around in a squad don't pick on the loan player who's just trying to do his quests, don't camp flight paths and graveyards and actually give people a chance to fight back, or are you that shite at pvp the only way you can win is by doing those things?
---
Oh and when I say "you" I don't mean you personally.
---
That was with layering. Not per layer.
---
World PVP is the only thing keeping me in this game, I love the thrill of hunting someone down. It gets my heart pumping!!! Let’s gooooo!!!
---
I dont think so
---
Someone’s salty
---
Devs made phase 2.  
---
Devs stood by and watched servers get to huge pop imbalance.  
---
Devs then made the ranking system and the need to constantly kill red.  
---
You tool.
---
Want's world PvP and you say go to retail. GTFO.   
---
If a server cripples like this, everyone in it is the victim.
---
lol... most dont give a shit about honor. This would change nothing. This would be a time I agree with the 'reroll pve' crowd
---
Ofc he doesn't go down without bringing an innocent into this!
---
- You don't need to spec holy during leveling, unless you only do dungeons.
---
- try to be mana efficient, flash heal, renew and shield are not mana efficient
---
- I usually use the 2 of the highest ranks of heal/greater heal (depends of your level) during most dungeons, test by yourself with which spell/rank you feel comfortable 
---
- I made a "w8 regen" macro :)
---
- Aggro on you? Bubble and run on the tank. 
---
- Fade is your friend
---
- Don't heal warlocks, unless they aggro mobs
---
- Always play zoomed out, so you are aware what's happening
---
- Be friendly, and add good players to your friends for next dungeons ;)
---
Ahh fair enough fella, just need to find that sweet moment when the Alliance can trash the Horde and nick the boss haha
---
Oh Rocknroll the dumbest guild leader of Flamelash 😂. After the mass exodus of alliance players he wrote a forum post and is expecting a „bright future“ for Flamelash. Some people are outright delusional. The server deserves to die!
---
Didn't people believe they did it as a "we told you so" experiment, expecting the game to be dead in a couple months?
---
That is true :)
---
But they don't anymore.   The only time a "wave" happens is when they get detection on something, just like the last LUA Unlocker "wave".  Now since there are fewer botting programs since Honorbuddy went down, there aren't waves so much as there are responding to reports.
---
If you rape a girl and get AIDS from her, are you the victim or she is?
---
I think that was the height of botting.  Back when Honorbuddy was around and everyone was using it.
---
For some people getting pvp rank is the game. It's up to the developers to make sure you don't reward toxic behaviour.
---
Which streamer is your favorite?
---
#nochanges, they thought they did.. it's a self fulfilling prophecy. Can't blame Blizzard really. They didn't even have to release wsg/av this early either.
---
The only reason I chose whitemane was I had already named my characters before blizzard panicked and created like 20 more.  First chance we had we bounced.
---
I think I'm going to convince my friends to roll alts there. Level up through dungeons/grinding somewhere remote, and then take on the ultimate world pvp challenge. If only bgs weren't coming out before that
---
their server dead lol
---
Because it's big karma to circlejerk about a nerfed addon that never let players do that to begin with
---
Leaked footage of the mongol empire plundering and looting what's left of the jin dynasty capital of zhongdu, modern day Beijing in China. (Circa 1215, colorized)
---
It’s the player base that chose to have servers much larger than vanilla? It’s the player base that chose to make servers imbalanced — when we aren’t given the information to begin with?
---
Don’t think so.
---
Theres actually a lot of money to be made to be r14 through streaming.
---
There's a hunter on mine as well, he spawns behind the Kargath inn where it meets the mountain and snipes people afk from the flight path, usually peels a couple kills before people figure out where he is
---
Just one faction right?
---
Lol, no im not the first guy, but if you think so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Plot twist: he was a hunter doing the Rhok'delar quest.
---
No it’s not shitty players, it’s incentivized agents acting in their best interest. The incentive structure is what needs to be remodeled in order for behavior at a large scale to be altered. If there is an optimal way for gaining a resource in a system you can expect most agents to use that way to gain resources if they are behaving rationally.
---
The time commitment for raiding is going to become significantly more when AQ and Naxx are released as the more serious players are going to also want to clear MC and BWL every lockout. In later expansions heroic raiding could be very time expensive also. Additionally the difference in gear of a naxx raider/ heroic raider vs a non raider in PvP is massive.  Also it encourages funneling gear like all the players in the classic duel tournament did which i think is disgusting. I think PVP being enjoyable without having to commit to raiding is great for more casual players and healthier for the game.
---
Asshole nature, not human nature as most humans playing the game didn’t do it.
---
Just a lurker mainly, im not even sure how karma works
---
Time for you to reroll to a sever more suited to your playstyle.
---
You either want classic or you don't, lol
---
Turns out blizzard was right when they said "you think you do, but you don't"
---
I'd call knowingly corpse camping all the dungeon paths and popular end-game quest locations and making the game unplayable for people because you're faction outnumbers them pretty shitty. Just so you can scrape up a couple of extra honor points before BG's are out.
---
LOL no. It was rampant before that, you just didnt notice. Certainly got worse, but people will kill you for no honor gain. Your garbage plan solves nothing
---
&gt;But what happens to PVP when ele/resto shamans can sustain a lot more burst output and still have mana leftover for cleansing
---
Alliance still wins.
---
&gt; You want to rank up do it fairly 1v1, 2v2 etc
---
"I never said you had to do that either"
---
&gt;Just don't run around in gank squads.
---
And I'll get ganked by gank squads if I don't. And yes, you might not mean me personally but that's what happens. If you try to PvP solo you're going to get killed by larger groups. The only solution is to form a large group yourself.
---
Well #nochanges is actually #nichangesfromthebigprivateserversnotfromvanilla
---
You are just grasping at straws here with your argument?
---
Comparing ninja looting to killing stuff for honor? 
---
With your mindset there would be competitive scene in any game. Who are you to judge his goals in the game?
---
20 minutes to port into Ironforge, get to the boat at Menethil, swim to Ony and kill her? That might be feasible if you're in APES or something.
---
People were praising APES on here when thats pretty much exactly what they do.
---
If anything it's the best example anyone could ever want if they held the stance that the honor system has a negative influence on players and indeed the game itself.
---
It's currently the quickest way to rank up. You call it griefing, I call it efficient.
---
My bad then mista
---
"You is not realy committed" shame rank 14 won't help your grammar.
---
All this thought about the future but we're here right now, and you can be out pvping like a king right now with virtually no pve commitment.
---
I dont care about PvP, mind, but...
---
It's really simple. People that want to gain honor have no other way to do so that killing the opposite faction. Now, your mistake is thinking that a collective of players from all ages, backgrounds and levels of interest in the community are going to, somehow, take a step back with trying to get honor, or either reroll to the opposite faction or join another realm.
---
What Blizzard *should* have done is simply implement the honor system *with* the battlegrounds. Sure, WPvP would still have been a thing (as it *should* be), but they'd have given the players who want to grind for honor the tools to do so. Leaving faction balance up to the players will never, ever work (hence why Blizzard only gave us the very few realms at the start, which obviously didn't work out, sadly).
---
You also burned all the boats they shipped the other toys on.
---
It's currently the best way to rank up. It's not a matter of just scraping a couple of extra honour points.
---
Should have joined a PvE server on release.
---
Yeah but see you don't understand, *my number went up*
---
It was nowhere near like this on even the most cutthroat PvP realms back in vanilla. I know because I \_was\_ there. But judging from your tone you're the type that's benefiting from the problem and your lack of empathy prevents you from seeing the problem.
---
I guess that is up to each server, firemaw eu it was more or less same with horde camping everywhere, honor changed that now people roam locations as well and camp boats, but thats about it. It was pretty bad even before honor, unfortunately.
---
90’s newspaper cartoon into a meme
---
Yeah I also wish that they were psychic and capable of seeing into the future.
---
Maybe the players could just be a little less shity to each other.
---
In a way it’s like a “that’s what you get”situation since everybody now-a-days just wants to be the main faction on a server.
---
You shared plenty of neutral towns with the horde in vanilla....
---
That's a nice screenshot, unfortunately neither me or any of my guildies are present in it.
---
I can't really speak for the other level 1s on flamelash but karma is seriously the last thing on my mind here
---
Would you rather nobody talk about it, just pretend that there aren't 20 alliance players paying $15 a month to play a survival simulator? Pretend that there aren't 10,000+ horde who have had their PvP realm turned into a PvE realm? Pretend that this isn't a threat to the longevity of Classic as a whole?
---
I'd say you need to get the stick out of your ass and just learn to live with these posts, because we're doing anything but harm.
---
We intentionally destroy ecosystems and biomes  that benefit us for personal gain. We think so highly of ourselves that we believe the environment doesn't affect us, right?
---
When people talk about the planet, they aren't talking about protecting a rock. They're talking about all the countless types of flora and fauna (to which you seem to want to pay proper respect) that are destroyed just because humans felt like it.
---
We do not live in such a way to ensure our future generations of humans have somewhere to exist despite those future generations being the only reason we exist. It's really selfish and arrogant to think otherwise.
---
I appreciate the unpopular sentiment about PvE and PvP. Even with all the problems in PvP now I'm very happy that I chose to play on a PvP server. This is my first time of playing WoW for more than a few weeks and I think I got more out of my leveling PvP experiences than of doing the endgame raids, even though they were great as well, especially Onyxia.
---
You're telling me your comment doesn't imply the person you're replying to is dumb for not getting the joke? Honestly?
---
This subreddit is wild, the guy simply made a comment saying it wouldn't really make sense to let them stack and he's at -21 points and here you are at 15 for 'HUE THAT'S THE JOKE'
---
leveling a warrior is like that. it will make a huge difference when you get sweeping strikes at level 30. then whirlwind at 36, pummel at 38, mortal strike at 40 -- all of those make a huge difference. just hang in there. in the meantime i guess yeah see if you can get a better (higher dps) weapon.
---
The problem with this train of thought is that given the distance of their vision they would also have to react swiftly that's not something that you want to do in a environment that you want to have as few permanent changes as possible.
---
I am 100% sure that if they knew that something terrible was coming they would do their best to curtail that from happening what the user is 10 to always find a way of being as shity and manipulative as possible.
---
Is hoj really that good (and worth the farm)? According to the fighting club spreadsheet it does not change much my dps. Considering the drop rate... I am considering to stop trying to get it. Am I missing something?
---
Use buffs for important things (like raiding), gold farming, I don’t get lag spikes, but I guess if I did that’s the only legitimate reason TB might be superior is because no one’s there.
---
Because they had to increase the server caps for some reason
---
&gt; If you want to be a toxic douche, then there's consequences to be paid.
---
NO! NOOOOOOOO!
---
I can't believe these idiots don't understand what you're saying. I get it, at least.
---
It's how we do things on the alliance. Penis sword hooooooo!
---
Stop blaming blizzard for the fault of players.
---
15k?  That would barely be a small realm on WoW Classic right now.  The largest servers were close to 100k before they broke the census addons.
---
Too many cowards leaving instead of fighting back. Flamelash was a good semi-balanced server not so long ago.
---
Rumour has it that warrior received it nstead as their whirlwind axe quest. To me it doesn't make sense why warriors suddenly have to help a troll shaman defeat a wind elemental.
---
Lorewise? Kinda neat to see the Horde take over Azeroth so quickly.
---
Gameplay wise? Let the kids have transfers.
---
So as long as you're incentivized to do something shitty it's all good right? If the horde players engaging in this nonsense had a spec of empathy they'd not mercelissly gank people trying to level because they're swarming the map like cockroaches, especially with BG's so close by.   
---
Either way, everyone is paying for their own sub and if they wanna do this stuff then they can, but pretending it's not scummy and selfish is pretty ridiculous, at least own what you're doing lol.
---
15k concurrent users lol
---
Dude I've reported the same bots several times a week for nearly 2 weeks and they still aren't banned. I char added them and it's pretty depressing seeing them get closer and closer to 60
---
There are more Alliance than Horde on European realms so I'm not that worried. Especially since pve, pvp and rp realms will all be mixed together in battlegroups.
---
They are way to punish players that did nothing wrong that's what they are.
---
A lot of the loudest \#nochanges people never even actually played vanilla.
---
* laughs in PvE*
---
Exactly. The Devs must be sitting there like "wtf they want us to do on this one..."
---
Don't forget we wanted this #nochanges #keepvanillavanilla
---
there isn't enough pve servers in comparison to pvp servers
---
Here's the solution imho.
---
1. Free (not paid) transfers from PvP servers to PvE servers - people need to be able to leave if they recognize the PvP experience is not for them
---
2. PvP servers get enforced transfer and character creation balance (no worse than 60-40); an imbalance means the more populous faction cannot accept new characters nor transfers where the account does not have an existing character on the realm
---
3. Faction based queues so the overpopulated side on full servers are incentivized to transfer off
---
4. The controversial one: a free level 60 boost token if you transfer a 60 of the outnumbered faction to an imbalanced server (greater than 60-40)
---
5. Monitor and merge PvP servers where the imbalance does not correct itself
---
For reference, BWL came out in vanilla 2.5 months after the first MC clear.
---
The only way that this f****** trash fire could have ever been a masterpiece is it blizzard word literally seers and could see into the f****** future.
---
You die in within the 5 min
---
"rumoured"  
---
Also, Nost didnt have just one server, so that 15k was spread out
---
Faction lock at like 45/55 or less.  Technically starting at 60/40 would already be a disaster as evidenced by Skeram/Stalagg/etc.  There definitely would have been grumbling/hating on blizzard for this decision but they might as well have gotten it out of the way then rather than the shit storm they have now.
---
Faction transfers are kind of wonky to me. It's not 1-to-1, and would give a leve 60 Hordie access to an all new set of quests that he could do again for different rewards, etc., essentially giving faction transferred characters access to two types of quests -- unless they removed all gear from exclusive quests but that seems like a ton of work.
---
Then there's the issue of Paladin and Shaman.
---
You can do that without greifing the other players on the other faction.   That's the abuse...
---
Nelf hunter is the best combo. Anyone saying otherwise don't know how to abuse shadowmeld combined with traps, FD, and pet stealth. Stoneform is good, but shadowmeld just straight up gives the hunter class a completely new depth to it that you can only understand if you practice with it.
---
I dont get The whole blame the devs thing. So we are blaming devs  from 15 years ago for not making a better system that we asked for again
---
&gt; Punkrats video about it just got taken down from YouTube. He showed all the help he got the whole way...
---
Well damn, I would have liked to see that. Best I saw in regards to his hand outs was a clip about 3-4 weeks after launch where he was sitting near the fountain in SW and people just kept opening trades and forking over gold. Dude got like 700g in 30 seconds doing absolutely nothing.
---
I mean, yah, they created it 15 years ago, and immediately got rid of it in tbc.   The #nochanges people were the ones demanding that they keep the system.
---
You’re wrong lol at its peak nost had 15k on one server. Idk what you’re arguing here buddy
---
And even then, isn’t it impossible to get top rank once the opposing faction leaves?
---
They’re forcing themselves into a corner.
---
No one is going to reroll either.
---
Prove it
---
Making everything default to PvE server forces people who want to play PvP to utilize a free transfer onto one of the theoretical new balanced servers.  The remaining PvE realms would probably have to be merged after it's all said and done.  Maybe balance on the remaining PvE realms would be normalized since they tend to be ally heavy normally.
---
As an Alliance player from Westfall, I have ZERO incentive to go to a pvp server. If I really want to farm HKs right now, we already have Hillsbrad. Why would I leave that to get farmed everywhere I go?
---
I take my hat off to you for trying to debate this idiot lol
---
But you should always play whatever you want to. loving your character look &gt; everything else
---
wait, what does pot of greed do ?
---
Lots of happy alliance players on PvE servers. Your post is not valid.
---
This is the rightest thing in the world
---
Are you trying to raid with this spec? If so pre raid daggers already sucks not to mention the fact you don't have one of your biggest steroids in adrenaline rush. If you only want to pvp is say it would be fine since you have prep and that's the biggest thing but it is by no means optimal. If you do raid with this though I'd be interested in seeing your logs
---
You don’t play anymore but you’re still here trying to put blame on blizzard. If you played a pve server you’d probably keep playing
---
That’s literally less than 0.00000001% of the community.
---
That was a good read, quality tale.
---
I love this shiz in Classic WoW.
---
Yojamba or?
---
Like I said to the other guy, it would make more sense to just offer free xfer to the pve realms for the horde.   This would do the same thing with less steps.
---
Just FYI, if you run off the opposing faction you will never get rank 14. 
---
So I’m glad you’re grinding so hard but you’re shooting yourself in the foot doing it.
---
&gt;How fucking dense do you need to be not to understand how huge of a change the increased population sizes on servers is.
---
Because when I look around Darkshire and see almost nobody, I know that there is very few people compared to 2005.
---
Well it's a better alternative to 5 resto trying to be controlled by one person lol. The important question is; on loot rolls does he roll 5 times or once?
---
I see a lot of people were like “#nochanges” and oh Blizzard is gonna ruin it all if they make some changes and now when u got EXACTLY what you wanted ur crying about everything. U should expect this, servers has larger capacity, it was obvious that hordes will dominate most servers and now a lot of people says it’s Blizzard’s fault, I don’t say they are perfect, but now u have 2 options:
---
1. Stop crying and start playing the way u can
---
2. Unsub
---
Can you let the big boys argue now?

Flying made an already small BC world even smaller
---
I found setting up mouseover spells made healing very simple.  I use the addon Clique and its simple to set up.  Basically it allows you to hotkey a spell onto your party members without having to select them, so I try to keep the tank as my selected target as much as possible, but can just move my mouse over another party member’s portrait to toss a heal elsewhere and quickly.
---
I don’t know what is the “most efficient” way to heal pre 60, but I leveled up to 54 as shadow and healed fine, then swapped.  “Heal” is my go to spell, I essentially let the tank drop 10-20% and toss a heal, they are full or near full.  
---
I will toss renew on party members taking some but not tons of damage.  Think mages during aoe situations, or melee dps getting hit just for being in range.  Pretty much keep this on warlocks when they are life tapping a bit.  
---
Then flash heal/shield are my oh shit buttons.  If someone pulls threat, or I send heals to other party members and now the tank is under 50% hp or getting hit hard.
---
Other than that I keep an eye out for magic and diseases to dispell, sometimes you can pick and choose for these though.  Not every party member needs to be free of all debuffs at all times, but you can usually toss a few out and not be too worried about mana.  
---
For me its all about triage.  There is a certain rhythm to damage taking, I can almost always wait for the tank to get plenty of threat before I ever toss out a heal, and I never run out of mana unless there is an over pull or when aggro a patrol etc.  
---
You don’t always need full mana and the tank doesn’t have to be 100% hp, just not 0% hp.  If I’m drinking in a dungeon a decent tank will wait until I’m at least halfway charged then pull.  You can continue to drink while they take a few hits then jump back into the fight with them.  I try to drink anytime I’m under 50% mana for trash pulls.  
---
This is my experience so far and its working out well for me.  I have played melee dps since 2004 and am always nervous going into a new dungeon but I honestly find healing (at least so far) to be the easiest role.  There are times when things get frantic but as a priest you have so many tools to patch most extreme situations, and can easily be the difference between a wipe or just some dead dps.
---
Nice words from a very safe faction on that server. You must know exactly what they've gone through
---
Stoneform is good if you get caught with your pants down. But saying it's way better is just plain wrong.
---
FROST SHOCK!
---
Yes, the longer it has been ticking the more dmg it does
---
I'm not sure why it won't let you but curse of agony does like 80% of it's damage on the last 4ish ticks of any rank of the spell so I'm not sure why you would want to recast it
---
Idk servers are already fucked at this point. I don’t think there’s any turning back.
---
You can deviate delight to go pirate/ninja. Basically makes you a human model
---
it's a horde-only pve server now
---
Obviously five?
---
So you need to let it drop off?
---
So 13k, not 15k, and that 13k is the entire game, not one server.  Thanks for disproving your own argument.  Have a nice day.
---
What trinket? There's no trinket from the fishing contest.
---
You're competing for what? Its a solved game. There's literally zero challenge to the entirety of the game, it's all solved.
---
&gt;Your plan involves creating even more servers for a population that is in decline
---
The decline is due to the game being "unplayable."   If blizz rolls out a solution that is viewed as agreeable, the people who still want to play (but can't now) will return. 
---
Also, most people are in agreement that server populations are too high.  This solution, which is effectively a server population reshuffle, would also allow server caps to be readjusted.
---
I would take TBC classic followed by WoTLK Classic and hopefully will see it as well. As for now, afte p6 there is nothing which means that after a couple of months of Naxx, there is nothing to look forward to.
---
But I think Classic has made loads of money for Blizz as it definately has upped the subscriber count, so being a company that likes money (duh), they would be stupid not to release everything a second time.
---
It's "free" money. In a sense, that development required is minimal, just the upkeep costs are there.
---
In classic, you can do naxx, know nothing about pvp, and dunk over far better players. That only appeals to people who want to win in pvp without having to put effort into being good at it.
---
Just look at all the people who complained about how the pvp sets are already upgraded. The thought of someone outperforming you with less skill and gear gotten through other means sucks, and pure pve players got a very small taste of what that feels like (not really considering the small amount of people who will even get that gear).
---
It is part of the curse. It gets stronger over time, so you can’t re-apply a weaker version. That’s why you get the message saying a more powerful spell is active.
---
Maybe they were raiding or some shit but vc clc collusion definitely was a thing, probably still is
---
might want to remove your horde flair before spewing some bullshit like that
---
I’d like to live in your fantasy world where this multiple server thing of you is true.
---
This is the way.
---
yea looks like a butthole
---
Not to mention how dumb people are thinking everyone is going to get to rank 14. I really don’t think they realize how much work that is.
---
But shouldn't you still be able to override it?
---
The point is to add those queues, even if they aren't needed for total population. It's definitely not ideal, but combined with free transfers it could definitely work.
---
You can exchange gold for full durability at a vendor
---
I think your memory might be faulty.  It didn't calm down until BGs released.
---
BTW, why didn't the whiners just roll PVE?
---
We all wanted Classic and the experience.  I guess it's my fault, I should have realized that the pissing and moaning that created retail would infest Classic.  It was inevitable.
---
Then ''every man for himself'' changed everything in wrath
---
The number of people who will get R13 and R14 relative to the number of people engaging in this behavior is so small its laughable. What a dreadful excuse.
---
based long cape boi
---
&gt;Remember back in 2004s people used to tip night elf female dancers on top of mailboxes?
---
i never remember this happening
---
Hr farming is not even about farming honor or pvp; otherwise ppl wouldnt camp fps for those honorless targets
---
The fact that Alliance were being camped so hard, that they felt the only option left to *actually* enjoy the game they pay for is to leave their server, COMPLETELY disagrees with your bullshit assessment.
---
It doesn't really have anything to do with debuff slots, since thats an issue in groups, and you can only have 1 curse up at a time anyways.
---
It just feels off to me, to not be able to override it in vanilla, and I used to play lock.
---
Killing players in a PvP game = sociopathy
---
&gt;People need to calm down, 
---
aka quit
---
Its in the name, whirlwind axe
---
But pretty much all Classic servers are 60-40 or similar... We just happened to have the thinnest skinned Alliance of the whole Classic.
---
Server population size is changes. We never got a no changes scenario.
---
I may raid but it will be few and far between.
---
Oh I see, that's actually really cool - maybe there will be some consequences to the toxicity that drove away so many players after all.
---
Stop pretending. Blizz had a lot of way to fix the faction imbalance without actually changing anything in the game itself, but they did nothing. In fact their server transfera often hurt the servers instead.
---
So single realm vs single realm or one big cluster or?
---
Plus no AH.
---
&gt; The more people there is the less important those numbers get
---
Thats the shittiest logic I have ever read on reddit and i've seen some bullshit over the years. The more people there are the more the imbalance is felt buddy.
---
It's #nochanges fault, which are the players.
---
Also, these toxic players are aware of what they do and therefore have a responsabilty on the situation.
---
I’m saying so the most damage is being done for that slot. It’s about having dps priority so you’re not refreshing it and lowering damage. 
---
That’s why it’s about debuff slots.
---
60/40 is fucking atrocious. Its almost a 2:1 advantage for Horde.
---
The fact that 60/40 is what passes for "fairly balanced" on PvP realms is the entire reason things are starting to melt down.
---
I’m saying so the most damage is being done for that slot. It’s about having dps priority so you’re not refreshing it and lowering damage. That’s why it’s about debuff slots.
---
Server population size is a change. We never got a no changes scenario. Stop squawking that nonsense.
---
Think of it as a minimum 2% increase plus some rage. I don’t have it myself but while I’d love to I just don’t want to farm it anymore
---
Shield slam on CD, revenge just behind that.   But this shouldn't have to be said.  Sunder is used on opening the fights up and staging additional targets.  SS and revenge is your primary threat abilities as sunder gets refreshed no more than every 29 sec
---
Yeah, on like three servers. Regardless though, that just makes you both shitty, two wrongs don't make a right.
---
They didn't milk the cow dry, they butchered it.
---
I just wish people who put as much energy into arguong on the subs and forums about this issue actually used their time for something of actual use.
---
You kill them when they respawn. That is the point.
---
Im playing ona severely minority faction and not ranking seriously. I spend a l ot of time in menethil fucking with the boat campers.
---
Im just explaining that the system incentivised this behavior. Especially since people don't understand how shit it is to grind ranks.
---
Perhaps unpopular opinion here: I always wished the currency for killing people in PvP would be called something else than *honor*. It might sound pedantic, but really, at no moment is honor involved in any part of what's basically a grinding process that you must do to the detriment of other players. I do believe PvP should get proper rewards, but the more I think of it, the more I feel the entire WPvP concept was poorly designed and implemented in WoW. It really feels like an afterthought, with terrible consequences.
---
You had a terrible time because you played the game how other people told you to play, and you rushed the content. To get the most out of Classic you need to brush up on your socialization, because it’s 50% a social game. That’s the half that’s missing from retail currently, and what we veterans wanted back.
---
It's weird they're shaking with their left hands though. Unless that was done purposefully to mark the level of irony.
---
It's a pve server without pvp, worst kind of server available.
---
Claw imo
---
How many of them were people checking in at 4AM to see how many other people were on?
---
You're not getting rank 14
---
Because they thought they would just cry to blizz and they would change it, hello retail.
---
You can cast another curse like recklessness or shadows, then reapply agony
---
I think that may have something to do with you not noticing when you do resist and it being obvious when you don’t. I play a paladin and, trust me, nearly every orc I run across resists my hammer in each scuffle. I’m sure they don’t notice that they’ve resisted but I sure do!
---
Meanwhile not 30 seconds ago a level 50 paladin attacked me a 60 undead rogue on the boat from STV to gadgetzan. I was perfectly fine to ride the boat in peace until he initiated..
---
Allowing flight paths to be camped so hard is such a bad move on blizzards behalf. I can put up with Alot of the weird world Pvp stuff but allowing flight paths to be camped has to he one of the worst technical decisions made in this type of game. Just post high level guards to protect the area that can't lose. There are many fixes, but yet we have to deal with a welcoming party at all FPs, wasting tons of Time.
---
We, as players, deserve the opportunity to land, observe the situation, and CHOOSE to leave, not be killed and forced into a fight you didn't want.
---
"Don't you understand? I had to kill the server!"
---
You're not getting r14, chucklenuts. The people getting it were probably decided before you even hit 60.
---
Alliance has always been hard mode since classic
---
The Honor system is just stupid.
---
These Horde literally HAVE to seek any scraps of honor to get rank and not decay
---
If I remember right, 6% should be sufficient @305 skill.  
---
I run 5% with OEB and over 2.5mil dmg I missed 0.6% of attacks.
---
Can I dial 1 for English?
---
Yeah, it is Blizzard's fault that people are able to grief other players to the point that they want to quit. Ever game designer should know that you can't just trust the players and need to have measure against that.
---
I honestly don't get this myself I play horde on Kirtonoa and it's probably 60/40 horde favor and I never kill low lvls I just let them be even if it's a 58-59 I only kill them if they are trying to be slick and try to fight me. Aside from that I rather they get 60 and I'll kill them at that moment. Not to mention I don't get were people find the enjoyment of camping players or raiding cities or zerging looks extremely boring.
---
They need to merge our servers with another... This is ridiculous. I wasn't able to play during the free transfer window so now I am just stuck on this server as a horde.
---
You can still just /afk out
---
I guarantee you if they released BGs with honor a large portion of the player base with rose colored glasses on would be screaming “MUY WPEEEVEEEPEEEEEEEE! REEEEEEEEEE!”
---
The one nice thing about this is it without a doubt makes the hardcore wpvpers the minority.
---
They are there to farm honor. Killing honorless targets is just incidental.
---
I know that, but its inconvenient  when you have a rogue on your ass and you want to apply your longest duration DoT just before you die.
---
Just feels really off to me, I know they have that system in retail. But if it was in classic I am really unsure about it.
---
I might be miss-remembering
---
He is a bit hyperbolic but he is still correct, removing layering didn't remove the players just shoved all those layers into one. It is why they had to further reduce draw distance because so many people on the servers. There is currently no server that is less populated then a "full" vanilla server, and most servers are 3-5x the population of a full vanilla on concurrently with up to 10x the amount of players on that server non-concurrently.
---
He gave you the answer, doesnt matter what your opinion is at this point lol
---
This is so true. I know some people irl that i know for a fact are griefers. They are all small (in either height or persona or both), socially impotent and has never had a single sexual encounter they didnt pay for. They all act like they are chad alpha males on the internet.
---
On purpose, need to change around some macros
---
**Guys 1 layer with no BGs and HKs implemented will work - trust me**
---
Hell yea, was 3 Warriors in party aswell, luckily I got away with a 24 roll
---
Thanks for your reply. I know the bis list and I have been farming sgc for weeks. Though I really believe that hoj (despite being bis) is overrated based on the spreadsheet. That's why I am asking if anyone has tried to think more about it. I am under the impression that everyone is following bis guides blindly. My hypothesis is that hoj may be really worth it only if you are full raid bis but if pre raid bis.
---
Fuck off racist scumbag. Go back to The Donald.
---
Says the person who never learned to pvp properly.
---
Everyone is murdering everyone all day long on my server, and everyone that is left are all the ppl who love it (rolled on the correct server type for their playstyle).
---
All p2 has done is remove all the cry babies from pvp servers that should never have rolled there in the first place.
---
I made an alliance even being horde my whole life
---
I figured.
---
In my very brief research, I found that the origin of the handshake was to show that you were not carrying a weapon. That's why we use our right hand to shake.
---
Instead of running away hey i better run around and die instead.. undead rogues never were the smartest players out there
---
Good joke. Players can always be dicks no matter what you do as game designer. The responsability for being a dick is on the player being a dick only.
---
Can I stack the 35 spellpower elixir and a flask of supreme power?
---
Hey, more fresh bread for yourself!
---
Imagine thinking FD trap was not intended by blizzard.
---
"Here's your innate form of CC that can't be used in combat, also this is a big part of your class fantasy - Also here's an ability that takes you out of combat, not an ability to combo with traps though"
---
Lots of horde transferred as well. We got some hundred new horde on our server.
---
I just sold mine in Org for 625g on Blameux. AH had a few up for 700-715 but mine wasnt selling at that so I just spammed trade chat. Both parties were excited and happy with price.
---
Do you not realise that is not the norm for literally eveywhere else?
---
Or all players just HAD to pick horde. And they just HAD to camp FP. And HAD to camp the boats. And HAD to camp capital cities. They had no choice, blizzard was holding a gun to their had. Very sad.
---
Its still the players fault for playing like absolute trash tier humans.
---
That’s what happens in an mmo, I don’t think anyone realizes a year from now half of these servers will be dead. You’ll be forced to make a new character on the more populated server
---
It to me it really show how little resources blizzard is willing to spend on classic. I’m sure it’s basically a skeleton crew working tickets about account issues. Also wonder if harder to auto detect bots with the code that classic uses. I remember OS runescape was like that but once they started to spend money on upgrading the old game they made easier to detect them.
---
idk how u can blame horde for farming ally in IF because it is the best honor and idk how u can blame alliance for transfering off this mess.
---
Blizzard should of been proactive when it came to faction pops and transfers but they caved because someone didn't want to sit in a queue on the 3rd day now servers are fucked forever.
---
People exaggerate when angry. Sometimes i feel like 70% lf the horde pvpers play UD male frost mage. But statistics on the internet are 80% of the time randomly just made up on the spot /shrug
---
How about I just let my sub run out on the 31st?
---
By that point you'll probably have lots of Horde PvE servers. 
---
Also good job having a temporary moment of clarity that people are ruining the game for others...before going back to the same tired mindset that just legit killed a server this week.
---
It's not like BG's were only a month away when this madness started amirite? You had no choice but to make the game completely unplayable for the opposite faction so you could get a couple of blue items early. I feel you man.
---
One big cluster, but only players from one language get teamed together.
---
[Hook of the Master Angler](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19979/hook-of-the-master-angler). Am I missing something?
---
Yup, I've been advocating this solution for weeks. It's the only way. Add free transfers to low pop same faction servers for the faction that has login queues.
---
Solves everything!
---
The difference was in vanilla you could attack the opposite faction in those neutral towns (and suffer some consequences) but in TBC you couldn't.
---
It adds a special feel to those neutral towns in vanilla, the fact that you're not 100% safe...
---
Thing is they *could* fix this.  Simply set a deadline to shut down the server and give the remaining players transfer options to servers where they wont upset the balance too much.
---
Oh wait they can't do that because every pvp server is horde dominated because kiddos gotta have their racials
---
Couldn't I still use them as an easy way to get hit? If I understand correctly, it would still grant me the same as 3% hit. If I'm trying to get 5% for dungeons, 3 from gloves would go a long way.
---
Pre expansions, the forsaken were just retaliating against a faction that hates them for no reason, they're basically just humans who aren't accepted by their own. 
---
In the expansions they jumped the shark and turned into cartoon villains.
---
&gt; and let us heal.
---
Get a grip.
---
Yeah man those Devs 15 years ago should of reworked and refined the system!
---
Why did you do it with three Warriors?
---
It would still be happening, it just wouldn't be quite as bad.
---
There should be a major warning that you have to click Accept at least 3 times to join a pvp server that says: "You will get killed on this server, you will get corpse camped, and no one will care except your guild mates."
---
Maybe give alliance experience bonus??? Making leveling alts easier on servers and promoting new players to come.
---
Are you new? Do you know how often mmo servers go down then you have to switch to a more populated one? It happens all he fucking time
---
Back when I started I think I went through 4 different servers because over time they start dying and you’re left with two choices, hop on a new server more populated, or play a dead one.
---
Let your sub run our. You may or may not be back but I don’t care if you are. Everyone just bitches about PLAYER VS PLAYER. Get over it...
---
You don't worry about competition before r9 anyway, so it will be easier
---
What, trying to strengthen alliance?
---
you don't have to take my word for it but my guild, across all classes, takes none of the "bis list" stuff as fact without doing our own testing and whatnot. the consensus is HoJ is a hard BiS. it isn't that hard to farm, you can 2 man with a decent shammy or 3 man farm arena/angerforge with a caster + healer, they both need stuff from arena/anger maybe golem lord.
---
Aight one more reply before I just assume you’re doing this to troll.
---
Carefully read this pdf put out by nostalrius, put out after their shutdown with an analysis seemingly above you. It outlines 2 facts, there was just 2 (two) servers, pvp and pve, with the pvp one reaching max pop of 13,7k. 
---
Here’s a challenge for you: read it through properly and explain to me how this in any way invalidates my statements, and more importantly, how it supports you in any way, despite zero proof on your part? 
---
Great stuff buddy keep it up
---
&gt;They didn’t give it to us ~~for a long time because they said we wouldn’t like it. Maybe they want to be proven right.~~
---
Fixed that for you. This is not what people asked for.
---
Okay
---
thx
---
That would be my assumption, I don't think elixers and flasks are classed the same
---
He gets full honor if I die, even if he does 1% of the damage.
---
And coincidentally why you can never trust a lefty /s
---
Fucking Blizzard forcing these players to grief others. 
---
The only mistake Blizzard made was making so many PvP server. It should've been 2, one where all the excess of Horde try harders play vs Ally bots and one where there is a nice 50/50 ratio.
---
Current PvP is just griefers abusing being majority faction, enjoyable for almost no one.
---
Should've added that /s, i guess.
---
You can’t just served transfer unless making a new character or if you’re on a certain server tho...
---
Wouldn't players from an OCE realm playing against EU just get assfucked by lag?
---
Because the population fluctuates daily? Imagine how many people log in on a Tuesday when raids reset, then don't log in again until the raids reset again.
---
Yeah, the data points fluctuates as the population does.
---
They are though. Now you guys are coming on here complaining that there aren't enough Alliance to kill/farm.
---
Exactly what Malchk said. Wth? This game is Horde vs Alliance, and your own faction lets you die cause they denefit from it,
---
Where the majority of realms are horde dominated. Enjoy.
---
I feel like there is an opposite affect to this as well... I'm in the minority here on a server that is imbalanced but favoring alliance (which I am apart of). I tend to leave horde alone in the open world not only because I'm a resto druid :x but also due to most of the complaints I read on here.
---
That being said, any time a horde sees an advantage on me, they take it and can you blame them? They are getting shit on 90% of the time and when they see clearly a resto druid herb farming what do they have to lose? Worst case I get to run away... On an alliance dominated server, I still see more roaming gank squads of horde than alliance because that is their only option and it leads to camping dungeon groups heading to DM, strat, BRS, ect... it's honestly not good for anyone, but is in their own (horde players) best interest... all being said I think a lot will be fixed when BG's are introduced (IF and its a big if) queues aren't ridiculous.
---
Footballers? That's definitely not the same thing its their job lol
---
Well all I know is that when I played fps like unreal tournament, quake, Cs 1.6 people would never do things like this. Fair play was a thing.
---
They were generating threat and maximizing dps. My guild runs like 4+ 20-man ony groups so we're rarely at the debuff limit. I usually stay hemo pvp spec since debuff doesn't matter and dps is so neutered anyway. Since reestablishing aggro is priority #1 going into p3, the tanks should generate as much threat as possible after they get fireball threat wiped. Nothing wrong with them rending her while in flight.
---
Blizzard hasn't ruined it. From the beta and the run up to release it was clear horde were going to be the dominant force.  
---
A big part of this comes from the fact that over the years the game has been stripped to the point that every single increase in dps or what ever is known about.  
---
People no longer play a race, class or faction for the sake of it. Everything now revolves around "I must be the best of the best" and this guide will tell me how.
---
Hop bud
---
&gt; flying didn't impact your questing. 
---
There were daily quests in BC that you did at 70.
---
Mad alliance player calling a whole faction kiddos over here, donations for this poor fella are appreciated
---
I’ve killed literally 4 alliance since the start of phase 2 I wasn’t even 60 yet getting camped the whole time... not complaining.
---
The queues used to be much longer, a lot of people have quit.
---
Cool story. Didn't know you were a Blizzard insider. How is the dev sitiuation going? Is it just 1 guy sleeping behind his desk?
---
Anyway, you couldn't transfer to PvE realms and BG queues should give you a good indication that Ally/Horde ratio was never 50/50
---
Ain't gonna happen honestly. Old Honor system was honestly dogshit since it just promoted premade stomps. Best advice I can give is not bugger with a bg if everyone is on the same server. Randos can't handle a premade. If you want to make rank just spend two hours a night and you can get 10 pretty easily even if you're dropping some bgs. Anything past ten you need to rock a premade and lose you mind honor grinding.
---
So there's constantly allies there but horde don't bother to fight back while having the numbers to do so? That's another issue. Where I play at i'm in the minority and even when we try to fight back it's simply impossible due to numbers.
---
Thank you guys for acknowledging that you picked the wrong server type for your play style. So many ppl roll on pvp servers that don't have time for constant pvp, or don't like constant pvp, yet most believe its up to blizzard to change how pvp servers work to accommodate them.
---
I love my pvp server and everything about it, even in the chaos of p2. Thank you for not joining in the crowd that wants pvp servers turned into pve servers cause they made the wrong decision.
---
[HonorSpy](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/honorspy). You're welcome.
---
yeah they did
---
played on flamelash and can confirm
---
The weapons have the stats from patch 1.6. Patch 1.11 only added a few more.
---
&gt;Imagine thinking FD trap was not intended by blizzard. 
---
Your condescension is not needed.  You can disagree with me without being disrespectful.
---
I would love for them to follow OSRS idea because I don’t want them to just follow out with TBC and such. Wrath was my favorite exp. but they also added stuff that in that ended up ruining the game like tokens and daily heroics for epic gear. I actually like the LFG but didn’t like the causal play style favoritism.
---
It’s great for priest twinks unless they go for the medicine pouch I think
---
Windseeker is the only pve server with a good faction balance.  Although I think it leans slightly alliance.
---
I spammed it 5 man with a war dps added to that comp and sometimes second mage or a rogue. I loved rogues an enhance there for the interrupts..
---
Not at all, it's extremely poorly itemized.  The only good reward from the head is the physical tank/dps neck for hit/crit.
---
Sure but they’re all in camps
---
So are the PVPers that want to farm their BIS pvp gear just supposed to go fuck themselves and let the other faction be? Cmon
---
F 😢
---
I dont believe they drastically increased it, at one point, I think they did allow servers to have an additional layer to help with queues.
---
Yeah I’m fairly certain Horde just do the same thing elsewhere but frankly I have no idea. Rarely any defense unless it’s guildies coming to someone’s aid. In my experience. Kargsth BRM Hanks happened in classic but back then it was 1-3 people in Karg/BRM at most not 5-15 in Karg 5 roaming SG, 5 at the top of BRM and 5 in the quarry and a shit ton at the entrance of BRM
---
Cry more
---
Hence the "almost", dingus.
---
Huh, that's interesting, it feels much more natural with horde on left and alliance on right.
---
No one enjoy this. It's all much easier. As any other person outside of your house in this world they don't give a fuck about you. They don't give a fuck about you, your time, your feelings, your thoughts, your opinion on all this crap. All they care - about themselves. And even if killing you is a very slight benefit for them - most will do it without a doubt. This game have too many players. You quit - they will find another one to farm, no big deal. It only takes one person to think like this and it's all ruined for everyone, because if they will not do the same genocide thingy - they will fall behind in gear/ranks.
---
Nice flair, douchebag.
---
Looks like overkill lived by their stupid name.
---
Its a bad character and always has been
---
I don't think the reason is just "work". Blizzard chose the 1.12 itemization and talent trees because it is considered the best one. There is a reason the items were changed to this particular stat set to begin with and it's not to make the content easier.
---
On my Druid, I sometimes innervate the healer in the group - my innervate macro whispers "Innervated" to the target, and sometimes I get whispered back "what is that for?" etc

It's a lot when you're a high school student living in a 3rd world country, who's saving up for graduation and university.
---
Bc heroics were ten times harder than any classic content we have now.
---
Westfall seems pretty good for balance, though it's a PVE server so I'm not sure that balance is that important. Still every week I see multiple Horde and Alliance guilds staging at Onyxia and MC.
---
Remember that BGs will be cross realm.
---
If alliance players played the game instead of bitch on reddit 24/7, we might have had a fair server pop balance.
---
There is.  
---
The pvp tag on the server selection.

---
Straight up preventing people from leveling or doing dungeons and being unable to admit that what you're doing is selfish is pretty sociopathic. I'd probably agree with you in the term being too dramatic if they didn't so deny what they're doing.
---
You are such a fucking whine ass cry baby holy shit lol
---
Sounds like a change and a certain player group would hate that.
---
Still nice flair, douchebag.
---
What server is big on eu, and is there any around 50:50 ratio on fractions?
---
Blizzard didn't, the thin skinned alliance crybabies did by quitting instead of getting better
---
yes! you are so close! now, tell me why im a coward?
---
You slaughter their brethren in the thousands.
---
I play alliance. Loser.
---
they never should have done the servers bigger then 3k thats the main issue here
---
I'd take arena a 100 times over shitty world pvp Tbh
---
Just Timmy's, Blizzard is a shell of what it was in the mid 2000s.
---
You are clearly  a dumb person and I don't  even want to discuss  this with you.  If you haven't  noticed servers are dying  because  of this imbalance  and the fact that Blizzard  are  not punishing the safe-spot exploiters in Capital cities.  
---
And I have not played Vanilla but I know for a fact that this did not happen in any shape or form back then. Let me explain  for you  why it is different now.
---
First- server size and development. In Vanilla  for almost  the entire duration  of the game the servers grew in population with a steady pace as people  kept discovering the game  but they were never so full of people as the average server is now,  which means there are less people farming  honor in the span between  the Introduction of the system  and the BG's.
---
Second  - the average % of non 60lvl players in those days was close to 40-50 % which means there was a lot less 60's to begin with and if you add into the lower number  of people on the servers- you could say there are around 3 times less max level people in the game in this phase back then. 
---
Third and most important- the people back then were  mo where near end game content driven as the people now. The average  player nowadays  is more aware of rewards, events and wants to obtain everything as soon as possible. 
---
This all combines and makes the game today nothing  like it was back then and everyone with half a brain could understand  that. The game as it stands today is unplayable on serves who have 40/60 ration  or less and thus people are just quitting at a big pace and servers  are beginning  to die not even 4 months  into the game.
---
Blizzard  did not  need a crystal ball to see this coming,  faction imbalance  on servers has been an issue  in retail  for years as well and blizzard never  addresses it properly there as well. This is clearly  their fault and everyone who says otherwise  is a simpleton who can't  see beyond  his personal  experience.
---
Hard to find a tank for scholo so to farm i would say Warlock SL(+destro aoe for bonus points), aoe mage, enhance, fury dps and disc shadowweaver is best dream team. I loved being lock tank for those 30 runs, and it was worth the respec.
---
Basically you are guaranteeing that you can pvp less in the world by doing so. The other faction will just leave. It is very short sighted.
---
it does more damage you can’t re apply it was the answer. if you want to get rid of it apply a different curse. a ticket will likely not do anything.
---
Not enogh allies for someone to get rank 14
---
But i guess my point is, whats going to solve the problem actually. Trying to create a culture on message boards that this isnt cool?
---
Why do you care about Repentance? It doesn't seem very useful.
---
Not 100% safe or how it's in classic: THIS IS A HORDE CITY NOW!  
---
I really don't enjoy that I can't pick up quests in Everlook.
---
This post couldn't be any more true.
---
Except there’s more twists with the monstrous races then the others. The monstrous races have fur, tusks, hunches that don’t negatively impact their species, scales .etc.
---
It’s easier to say Orcs are Humanoid Pigs than humans with green skin and tusks and other crap. Same with Tauren. 
---
But also those 3 are traditional fantasy villains. Minotaurs, Orcs and Trolls are well known as monsters in DnD and the like just like Mind Flayers, Dark Elves .etc
---
The system didn't force anyone to do anything, but it did incentivise it. And ultimately it's easier to make some minor changes to HK thresholds or whatever, than it is to try and persuade literally millions of people to try and change their behaviour.
---
farming honor = being a asshole
---
hur dur

---
I mean yeah, it's cheaper for a casual like me, since I'd probably need another 3 months of subscription to reroll and get the same stuff...
---
... but it's like I'm paying for someone's inability to balance the servers; and I'm not giving my money for that.
---
Same thing happend on Grob. Alliance had a lot more 60s and way earlier than Horde. P1 was mostly about Horde getting run over everywhere. Then P2 hit and now the horde is wiping the floor with them.
---
Yeah well you need the pet if a rogue opens on you, right?
---
At 60 when you are ready to raid. Yes.  Dungeons are much better with arms. Sweeping strikes is just super powerful.  Arms is simply less gear reliant than fury.  So it's easier to gear for.  Fury is terrible with bad gear,but scales to stupidly high levels when you get good gear.
---
Name checks out.
---
It's almost like the players are different.

The recend trend of survival/pvp games the last years and a whole new generation of young twitch kids that slowly found out about wow.
---
Rextroy on YouTube is fun for oneshots.
---
Human mirah's. Else Eskhander's right claw. But seriously if you're not human stop being lazy and go get weapon skill.
---
The List:
---
\-Aged core leather gloves (daggers)
---
\-Mugger's Belt (daggers)
---
\-Edgemaster's Gloves (Axes swords daggers)
---
If you're not human you should have one of these and use one of these weapons for tanking. Non-epic weapons +5 weaponskill is better than the Right Claw.
---
Scarlet Kris + Mugger's Belt is pretty easily achievable on a tank. If you don't want to shell out for scarlet kris, alternatives are Sentinel's Blade by the 10th, or darrowspike from the Ras Frostwhisper quest line.
---
If you do end up getting edgemasters, options are annihilator, mirah's song or bone slicing hatchet from strat UD.
---
And obviously the raid drop weapons are also relevant. If you go with Aged Core Leather Gloves or Mugger's Belt, you should really look at getting an epic dagger to tank with.
---
It's extremely important for your threat gen that you have +5 weaponskill with the weapon you're using. Be human or get it from items. +4 is not good enough.
---
If you playing hunter you should be:
---
Doing tribute runs for gold
---
Doing Mc for the set (even ur not in a guild pugin is easy)
---
The set is way better than the blue pvp set. For both pvp and pve.
---
Not sure why u want the blue set.
---
And then what... Sit around and do nothing?
---
By now I decide on class and race if I gank. Undead Mages / Rogues are KOS, I ignore the rest if they ignore me
---
Yep, Alliance lvl 55 on a pvp server here, done with classic until paid server transfers. Fuck this shit.
---
"Its not as bad as you say it is!"
---
*Literally an entire server's alliance population leaves because of how bad it was"
---
"Lol bunch of quitters it wasn't that bad"
---
Way to miss the point
---
I have the same feeling when I see level 60 mages with int rings. [Band of the Unicorn](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7553/band-of-the-unicorn) goes for as low as 10g on my server at times. Presumably because it's a green level 45 item that doesn't appear on any BiS lists.
---
Come to dragonfang and play as horde i would happily inv you to our guild too. Nice population not too high and never had a problem with stability.
---
No idea, I'm not bringing solutions. I'm just saying that you can't blame the players for being players. Yeah people have been abusing the system, but the system is the issue, not the players.
---
The irony when the "one" change is the core of the problem.
---
True, this is why I rolled PVE.
---
Amazing reply thank you
---
What are you talking about? CoA doesn’t have that mechanic in retail? It’s always been how CoA worked until they changed it to have visible stacks

It's what happens when you don't go outside.

Hi, /u/TruIISengar

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e7f19u/free_horde_to_alliance_faction_change_on/). 
---
Yes, the main issue is that you don't have a chance to fight back. There's always going to be griefers but blizz gave them absolute power with not moderating server faction balance.
---
Cuz the alliance has to give war supplies to have the gate open. So unless the horde are going to make cross faction toons and send items over it's not gonna happen
---
25 euro or the inability to make any useful progress on that char for the foreseeable future?
---
Ya, went mainly because questing is impossible and XP is XP
---
Yep, it's completely consensual and not subjected to being killed 10v1 for hours on end or having a level 60 camp level 30s for 6 hours straight.
---
You got us there man, good point.
---
And it is still not fucking toxic sociopathy behavior.
---
...sigh
---
The world was designed around the technical limitations of that time.
---
If they could have given people flying mounts in vanilla, they would have, but the world wasn't meant to be seen "from above".
---
Same is true with several mechanics of the game, including the population cap.
---
You know, you may be right!
---
Pretty useless for dungeons. But great for raids.
---
I play alliance. Learn to read.
---
If you liked the hunter but want to be caster, i would recommend warlock. Caster with a pet 😀.
---
Or druid... druids are awesome
---
There are a lot of younger users on this sub and there a bit of a clash with the older users who are here to bathe in some nostalgia. I can't help cringing at the smug "everyone was so bad back then" comments but that's because I fall into the older group.
---
It's not unusual for people in their teens and early 20s to believe their generation is somehow special and far superior to those that came before it. Once you get older you realise you're just repeating all the same shit your parents did.
---
Don't you dare come in here and use a sound argument to ruin my dreams! dammit man! *slams fist on desk*
---
FYI Horde does the same shit. You just don't see it because you're on that side.
---
Ill dip out of a group if there is more then 2 casters (excluding healers) or 7+ mages for 40 man raids. When I make groups its always 1 Tank, 1 melee DPS, 1 Range (me), 1 Healer and 1 Random DPS (Melee or ranged, normally whoever messages first)
---
Then you got pve servers which are high pop full of allies (72/28)
---
My server is the same except alliance do it to org and uc
---
...and a warm applause to the opposing faction teaching me how to manage my rage more productivly!
---
Agreed. Yeah we're out numbered but we often wipe horde with ease and our honor farm is great. Skeram is right on the line of being too bad but not quite there yet.
---
indeed
---
meh. offer free accounts to alliance players on those servers. probably solve the issue in short order
---
I would definitely quit but they can do what they think is best I guess? I have no faith in community feedback improving classic. Blizzard listening to community complaints is what turned classic into retail.
---
So it really boils down to the end reasoning that there should only be PvE servers then right?
---
Because it's extremely silly for anyone to think alliance players should just suffer through it and not leave the servers that they're currently getting griefed to hell on.
---
If people want to leave then let them. You said yourself that a horde player would never join a server where they'd be the minority, so the only logical conclusion is alliance players leave and pvp servers die.
---
*Laughs in human racial*
---
Just a heads up. Rogue isn’t that much fun in big group death packs like what’s going on at the moment. 
---
They are so much fun in 1v1 or 1v2, but right now are not that enjoyable IMO.
---
Can’t put my finger on it as to why.
---
Yeah thats complete garbage. Benediction was one of the closest faction balanced servers out there.
---
And sure enough, once P2 came around alliance started to become less and less prevalent, with a lot just straight quitting.
---
Now it's probably closer to 60/40 Horde. 
---
Can't fix a problem when it's one faction that is just less interested in one aspect of the game. Dont get me wrong, there are still huge groups that will run through, and small coordinated squads I run into regularly as horde, but not as much as right when P2 released.

Found this thread at least, so I am not the only one who has been reacting to it.
---
Thanks for your honest take on your experience, it sucks, buy it's also nice to see how you thing WoW can be enjoyed still, by players in general. How about joining a guild where camaraderie cokes first, perhaps joined by raiding too as a priority? On m'y server (Earthshaker-EU), I saw someone advertise guild recruitment saying they're a relaxed bunch but take raiding seriously. I'm sure there's a lot of guilds with that attitude, and it sounds like it would be a good fit for you. Lots of guilds out there, I don't see why we have to compromise on our values and preferences, if we really care that much. All the best to you, whatever you end up doing (or not doing) with WoW.
---
Defense is overrated, you don't need to be defence capped for Ony or MC and you certainly don't need it for dungeons. Stamina and offensive skills are all you need, most BiS lists will show you the sort of gear to wear for generating threat. It's important you become more of a bruiser than a wall, to steal terms from other games. 
---
I would suggest keeping a shield on most of the time though, even if you want to fury tank as armour is probably the most important defense you have. 
---
You can get away with doing things like arena runs without one though since enemies range between level 54-60. Just judge it yourself.
---
I bet you that’s not true for most players. Most guilds on my server still takes at least two days of 3-4 hour of raiding to clear both ony and mc. Then there’s the time invested in farming gold for mats and respecs and you already have a pretty big time investment each week.
---
That was a big woosh
---
Way too many people think they're going to be rank 14.  Simple fact of the matter is unless you have no responsibilities or life what so ever you won't get rank 14.
---
Keep in mind that on the few pvp servers where the alliance greatly outnumbers the horde, the same exact thing happens, but in reverse.
---
I think that analogy doesn't work because blizzard is not selling a product like a toy, but a service like a club for kids. Blizzard is responsible if there's any bullying. Well they should be, but I think they profited much more from classic than they've accounted for, so they don't give a shit. At least that's how I see it.
---
*Nuh uh - there is no pvp on a pve server, you're a carebear!*
---
Sincerely,
---
Half the dumbasses on this sub 3 months ago
---
Don’t hate the player, hate the game
---
Did you see how much the community hated layering? so the solution is to layer almost every single server forever? The perfect solution is just let nature takes it course. These things balance themselves.
---
To cleanse the land of horde scum.  They’re rapists and murderers!
---
You are pissing off real persons though
---
Then you're 1 out of 10000 horde players that actually do show normal behavior.  The rest doesnt care. They are more interested in "pwning" alli. Tje burning toy analogy is great that guy deserves a medal, some give him a medal.
---
Ah the cherry on top of the Reddit shit sandwich. When all else fails invoke logical fallacy to try and brute force the argument.
---
Lol how original, you did the cool reddit comeback.
---
I personally would love if they followed the way Jagex handled OSRS. I played OSRS for years, maxed out and continued playing and had a ton of fun with it. I loved the way we had a say in what came into the game, since we were the ones playing it. I did recently stop to play classic ofc with my friends and I’m enjoying it just as much, if not more. 
---
But in short, if blizzard just follows along with what the community wants as a majority pertaining to classic, whether it be completely new content or old expansion re-releases; they’ll have a happy player base. Just my opinion.
---
If each alliance player would go in front of 5 hordes and take 5 deaths to each of them at the spirit rezzer before starting their play session I think an agreement could be met.  Have them line up like blood cattle for pvp vampires.
---
Just saying that the stats are crap - except the FR. The FR is good.
---
I thought the same thing!
---
Nailed it
---
Which ones exactly, beside pop cap?
---
Plenty of time brother, take the jump.
---
Horde have the overpopulation on most realms. So they have longer queues
---
Yes... by killing them repeatedly in a video game where you're meant to kill the enemy faction lol
---
You know why you shake with your right hand? To show theres no weapon in it lol
---
I'm on Fairbanks which has worse numbers. I certainly don't farm in open. I make all my gold in dungeons. I world PVP'd in a small group with friends the first couple weeks but don't really enjoy the current situation. It rarely tilts me because I know how to avoid and I know my limits. Yesterday trying to run my 53 alt to BRD at 830AM ST (just so I could log off and be there 10 hours later when friends were ready to run) and having it camped beyond the point of honor by a 6 man horde group that I recognize being online 12 hours+ a day *before I could even get over the bridge into BRM* was one of the rare occasions where I had to log off and step away for my own sanity.
---
I imagine they'll end up having second accounts to make Ally toons if it really comes to it.
---
wait...
---
This comment sucks because no changes would mean not so huge realms. So it is not no changes.
---
*eating popcorn and watching form pve server*
---
Killing afk players in cities and corpse camping people with lesser numbers or lower levels isn't fun for anyone.
---
I'll repost my comment here, since you're reposting the same comment multiple times in this thread.
---
To summarize: Freedom of interaction means choice, you have way more choice of what to do on a pve server than pvp.  You actually get to choose when you want to quest or pvp.
---
Pvp "freedom" only means freedom for the aggressor(s) to grief you without having the option (choice) to opt out of being subjected to your 10 person gank squad.
---
The 10's of thousands of people stuck in queue the first two weeks would beg to differ. People requesting them to increase them further was already happening like 2 days in lmao
---
but you’re a warlock.... how are you dying to rogues anyhow?
---
I'd never take you in a raid like that.
---
While not 110% certain... I'm like 90% certain you could reapply it. I remember for the exact same use case OP is wanting it for. One final fuck you from the grave.
---
From a sociological perspective?  Sure.  It really shows how many people decide to be complete shitbirds when you incentivize cruelty, create tribalism, and remove communication.
---
level weapon skill faster, great for warriors too!
---
ah gotcha thanks didnt know that!
---
I'll gank a Lv16 Rogue, don't care at all.  They might not deserve it today, but one day they will.
---
You thought you, but you didn't.
---
"you're assuming things"
---
"the reason for this is my assumptions about their motivations, and my abritrary definition of a made up word"  dude can you at least get through a whole sentence before contradicting yourself if you want to try and come play Captain Contrarian.
---
Do people actually rp on deviate delight?
---
I agree. It's a bit crazy to call it sociopathy though.
---
who cares about if camping when you can pvp off unless they are killing the auctioneer or something
---
Not sure about that one. I think a lot of the nochangers are just blinded by nostalgia. I never played vanilla or any other WoW and because of that, I have no perceived notion of what the game "should be" to satisfy my nostalgia bone. I desperately wanted them to go the classic+ route because there are things wrong with this game.
---
&gt;That’s literally less than 0.00000001% of the community.
---
[I know this game is popular, but literally less than 1 in 10 billion players?](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/021/665/DpQ9YJl.png)
---
I can go to horde vs alliance raids all the time on Pagle. This is worse than a PvE server lol.
---
nah I like it, saves me mana and a step, plus let's me know they care ;)
---
Because I play alliance, so I can't fear them, I can't seduce them.
---
But I can dot their ass to oblivion and have them go down with me.
---
If I have voidwalker I might survive (with the shield) but since voidwalker is trash vs shamans and priests, I usually don't use it.
---
Great post

Who will be potentially on a different battlegroup, or who may not even touch bg's ever.

If someone was streaming and going for r14, wouldn’t that just be the never ending 24h-streamer?
---
EVERYDAY IS 24H STREAM DAAAAY!!!!!
---
It’s commonly believed we shake with our right hands for this reason! It shows that both people are not armed.
---
&gt;So form large groups and take on other large groups.
---
I already do that. But then people still complain that my group is larger than the other group. Sorry for not counting the number of enemies in each group before I attack.
---
I'm sure that I was among the most outspoken in opposition to layering so you can imagine that I'm not enthusiastic about this. I still remember the sinking feeling when I returned from a vacation last May to find out what they were going to do to Classic. But layering and megaservers have caused their damage and now the question begged is whether or not Blizzard takes steps to put things back together or accept continued deterioration. 
---
This will not naturally balance out. Alliance are just quitting the game. Frankly I don't see how we're going to do AQ40 or Naxx if we can't farm herbs in the world. My faint hope is that this notion somehow gets in front of the eyes of someone involved with the project and they bring it up in a meeting. I think the game can be saved.
---
The difference is that the toxic people are breaking the toy for thousands of other people.
---
you can make level 10 alts to get 15 quick hks in wsg
---
Its fine to put the fault on the player. Do you really think nothing should ever be the players fault?
---
Wasn’t trying to be original.
---
Absolutely not. Just make sure you roll on a PVE server.
---
i don't remember having polls for updates where i can vote... 
---
btw, as far as i remember, OSRS update passes if it gets 75%+ positive votes. 
---
Personally, i would love to see this kind of approach in Classic WoW, but i highly doubt it might happen
---
I’d do Ret until 30 or so until the mage can AoE and then spec prot/holy to aid in AoE and also to be a tank for ease of dungeon leveling.
---
The reason I like to play on a pvp realm is that people CHOOSE if they kill. It's not decidable if you want to be attackable. There is no excuse. If you attack you wanted it. It shows me more of the person behind. To me an MMO is not about points, but about the interaction.
---
Sell it now it will only decrease in value. Shoot for 600-800g.
---
Spoken like a true sociopath. I paid money for my toy so I can break yours with it
---
If your alliance and looking for a PVE server. Pagle is your best choice.
---
Azuresong
---
Was really tame.  Hardly anyone ever was hotile because they need to be fishing and not fighting to win.  If you didn't have your hearth stone set to BB and ignored everyone else then you were going to lose.
---
Now days, I can see people showing up to PvP fishmen with no interest in competing themselves because so many more people no life this game.
---
MFW the same people autisticly screeching "red means dead" before release are complaining about pvp now.
---
Well, you are paying for your inability to transfer during the time it was possible, which was for months
---
No? Current "full" servers aren't less full just because layering is removed.. and high/full pop servers still often do not have queues (except for a few).
---
why arent you in the mood to talk to me?
---
Including transferring/quitting and tanking the server.
---
Thunderfury actually has swings in pop for both Ally and horde, I think we have a nice balance as there are both death balls on horde and Ally side and some dungeon entrance camping from both sides
---
Imo, you're wasting talent points. 
---
What is your goal with this build? What do you Invision it doing?
---
2/2 Sinister Strike seems redundant.
---
Bladeflurry is more for pve.
---
29 points into subtlety and no Hemo? I think you should think about picking that up if you're going to go that deep in.
---
I would be all for the people griefing the other faction getting banned.   It won't happen though, because blizzard doesn't care.   They're not reinvesting any of the money we give them to support the game.
---
I’m unsure if the hit calculations for level 61 and 62
---
There is like 5 gnome mages that live on the inn in everlook. Lmao

Hey man, Stonespine Eu is a very healthy server. It’s a little horde dominated but I play alliance and it dosen’t really bother me ( unless I’m trying to get to brd/lbrs/ubrs on peak hours ). Other than that it’s a really player friendly server and welcomes new players. If you end up joining the server and alliance. Hmu my characters name is Myx and you could get a inv to the guild I’m in (Wrath of Two Bears) it’s an active raid/leveling guild. Mostly we just shoot the shit and tend not to take the game to serious. Don’t let these posts scare you away with the game being imbalanced.
---
One convenient locations, in Africa.
---
Because it didn’t take me 45min to get into BRM lol.
---
they could have wait patiently for battlegrounds to come, grinding ranks slowly while only wpvp is on, but they decided to go all out to the point of burning out absolutely everyone
---
Just buff the alliance racials like they buffed the horde back when they were the underrepresented faction.
---
At what boss are you suppose to wipe at
---
It does because this is the BIS feral tank fire resist weapon in the game forever. Very expensive price for such a small thing, but it is.
---
&gt; there is a reason it was immediately abandoned 
---
People seem very reluctant to listen to this reasoning. Every time blizzard changed or added stuff in the game, the intention was for it to be better. That’s a lot of years of getting better. It was pretty shit when it was released.
---
Getting wow again today. Pretty excited to play classic. For dungeons and raids. Are ret paly still viable? I played one during bc and didnt have any issues but it's been awhile
---
Just because some horde are on heartseeker, doesnt mean 20 other servers arnt shit holes
---
It's really not. You have to realize that there are other human beings connected to the characters being killed over and over.
---
When you start treating other human beings as a resource to be harvested, encouraged to do so even, then there is very little empathy left in you, otherwise you'd live every game session in cognitive and emotional dissonance.
---
Found our botter.
---
Ah true ha so many things to factor in.
---
Honestly. Wow lol maybe it's cause I'm tired but I never got close to this lol.
---
Duh...lol thanks
---
I have to assume that they kept 2-3 welps alive on them at all times so rage shouldn't be an issue whatsoever. Rending is more dps than not rending. It's also more threat than not rending.
---
please continue this
---
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should
---
&gt; Cs 1.6 people would never do things like this
---
\&gt; Shoot a guy running straight at you
---
\&gt; Realise he's carrying a knife
---
\&gt; Realise he typed "knife fight" in chat
---
\&gt; Still feel bad about it almost 2 decades later
---
Imo the best way to address this is pop capped factions with free character transfers and cross faction changes. 
---
Because horde outnumber ally the horde can do cross faction changes and not ally. Servers with an imbalance where there are too many horde can have horde leave but not come in. In this case ally can come in but not leave.
---
All of the above is just cosmetic fixes though and doesnt address the real issue which is that the ally racials are just worse for pvp and that the ally have worse pvp protected towns. To actually fix the problem these issues will need to be addressed.
---
Battlegrounds are cross realm. It literally won't matter next week that many pvp servers are suddenly horde pve servers.
---
You fortnite kiddies ruining wow classic with your complaining.
---
PvP is PvP. Please just go play PVE and stop complaining.
---
Link?
---
On the bright side, my utter contempt for the state of this game has given me the opportunity to play some of the great new games that have come out recently. So thanks blizzard, I guess.
---
I wouldn't say cool at all, but from a social experiment standpoint? It's extremely interesting.
---
Well it would be a bit disingenuous of them in this case, then :P
---
glad I could help :)
---
Yeah, that's the nature of multiplayer games.
---
&gt;players transferred because they were on the losing side
---
Where is the data that supports this claim?
---
There is none. Players transferred because of queues.  Blizzard didn't monitor the balance of people leaving.  The players didn't monitor the balance of people leaving (because they couldn't)  and ended up with a large imbalance.  THEN people started leaving because of the imbalance.   
---
At that point it was too late and snowballing into the server collapsing.
---
Its certainly toxic, calling it sociopathic is going a too far, but if you read the definition of a sociopath I would say it fit a toxic griefing player very much.
---
The servers are way too large. I've been saying this since they announced the servers would be much bigger than in vanilla. Add in faction balance being garbage once more and here we are once again. Bli$$ard has either no clue or they're doing it on purpose in some odd way to get people to jump ship and try out retail.
---
Wait are payed transfers a thing now?
---
This argument is moot. There are way more players on modern servers. But the number of new players starting after launch is drastically lower. Thus, you see far less people in low level zones.
---
It is literally an action bar addon, what needs to be translated? Wtf.
---
I think the corps campers will be doing same but they want the first step ahead done just so
---
Yup, true!
---
I would still on a pve server or roll horde
---
No changes
---
true !
---
&gt; TBC also make the faction imbalance even worse
---
What are you talking about? The Alliance had more players than the Horde during vanilla. Even now, when Horde is dominating retail in terms of numbers, the total character numbers are basically 50-50 because of long term Alliance number dominance. It's only when you look at max level characters that the difference comes through. Even when you restrict to something like minimum level 60, the total populations are still roughly 50-50.
---
Yes you are a loser we get it pal.
---
For melee DPS warrior is the best right now, with Rogue a close second. Ranged DPS mages are best, with Warlock in second place.
---
Could've told then this would happen 2 years before the game launched. Sheer incompetence and ignorance
---
I am left handed so I enjoy sticking my left hand out there for the hand shake, fuck you right hand dominated world. /howls
---
I've been told paly is bad. So what's good? I've played most classes and can have fun on most. Just want to get back into things
---
[Power Word: Barrier](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=62618/power-word-barrier), [Halo](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=120517/halo)
---
Sounds very hordish to me.  
---
BTW, I don’t camp flightmasters. I usually wait in a distance which takes the alliance about 30 seconds to get to. Coincidentally, ofc.
---
I like either full fury and arms for switch stance which is the most fun spec next to sword spec. Deep prot with tactical mastery, silence on shield bash and standard prot pve spec.
---
Just play ret. The raid content isn’t as difficult, and you should be able to find people to play with you /run mc with you. It’s more important to have fun than min max every detail. I would recommend just keeping a healing set on you for faster runs.
---
Usually play very servers for mains. Never had much fun with pvp
---
Or you know... They could've just implemented the honor system from day one, so by the time casuals got to level 48, most people would be pretty done with PvP and it wouldn't be anywhere near as bad as it is now. Everything Blizzard has done wrong so far with classic, private servers did right. They clearly don't care.
---
Wont happen we have been playing 6 years since nostalrius.
---
In that instance it isn't going to matter. If the last ticks arent going to kill them, they will have dropped combat and started eating before the new cast did enough damage to kill them.
---
Arcanist belt is shite so all good :)
---
Blizzard sucks cuz no changes did not mean release honor months later it meant no quality of life changes
---
Fuck no.
---
Holy/prot hybrid allows you to AoE, which will complement tje mage AoE nicely.
---
Just be careful, might not work if there are 4+ raid groups at entrance due to lag. Escorted a guild right after onyxia buff and there was some other alliance guilds and some horde ones fighting. Some people didn't make it in.
---
Warlocks are always in demand at 60 for raids and dungeons.  After that, hunters, rogues, druids, paladin healers and dwarf priests are In demand
---
The best class in classic though is a warrior.  Commonly played so a raid spot can be tricky.  But if you are willing to tank, they are in super high demand. Go arms until max level and then Respec deep prot to get gear and then fury for raiding.
---
I figured the classic experiment wouldn't work out the way people would think even when I saw everyone's obsession with BiS before honor was even put in.  Back then people didn't care about that kind of stuff.  We just put on our dungeon and tier sets and called it a day.  The same way people didn't really care to do world PvP for ranks.  Few people PvP'd for rank until BG's were well in game and established.  And 90% of the mass PvP was in Tarren Mill or Blackrock.   Of course nowadays with all the info we have this stuff is kind of inevitable.  Ignorance is bliss they say.
---
Flying, homogenization if PVP (which is probably due to flying), and horrendous power creep were the only faults BC had, along with a few zones I didn't like leveling in, but those might be more personal.
---
Yeah, same thing unfortunately. So glad that I‘m playing horde on a almost 50:50 pvp server
---
Yeah I am personally going to unsub and go back to osrs this month
---
Pally is good. Ret is bad.
---
I also multibox, but paying in Euros, 12,99 x 5 = 64,95 EUR/mo. As a senior developer in Copenhagen, it is just 1h of work roughly. Considering a meal in a restaurant for 2 costs that here, I would say it is very cheap considering the amount of time I invest in this game.
---
I AM ally, it would be the inverse for me lmao.
---
Colorized u filthy Brit
---
The minmaxers stay, the casuals will leave
---
To be fair the grind for a reward is a big part of the game.  To expect people not to work towards it is unreasonable.
---
Your wish is granted.
---
No they do not.
---
You are fluent in moron, I see.
---
Sorry, my mistake, I just assumed they were.
---
Maybe if you're alliance
---
APES is on the underdog faction
---
So let's say you're lvl 60 and this coming Thursday your guild had setup a raid to kill a world boss and you're looking forward to a drop. During the Tuesday patch you get pushed to Herod 1a and cannot attend the raid. You don't think people would be frustrated with that?
---
and the best part, it won't even hurt them. BGs will be cross-realm next week.
---
Yeah but it’s ruining the fun of the game for them when it’s an imbalanced situation. Having empathy is not a weakness mate.
---
Also the dps rankings (for alliance) are basically this.
---
Tier 1
---
Warriors, mages, rogues
---
Tier 2
---
Warlocks, hunters
---
Tier 3
---
Feral Druids, Shadow Priest
---
Tier 4
---
Balance Druid, Ret Pally
---
Why don't you go ahead and create a char there
---
Ah. I may go warrior. I've had almost every class. Just always liked the magic and melee mix of ret.
---
People wanted #NoChanges, all these systems were well known for 15 years, it is on you to understand what you're signing up for. This is a community problem caused by us, the players, now we can live with it. They can offer faction specific transfers, but why would Horde on a server like Faerlina ever take them? They have no reason to. Limiting the transfers to only Horde would just tell the Alliance they're trapped there unless they reroll, super shitty.
---
For pvp boar its charge.
---
Players act like companies that destroy the planet for personal profit
---
I am Dutch
---
You think the non-casuals will leave before the casuals? Wut?
---
This handshake implies more trust in one another, because they've dropped their shields. That's what I learned from boyscouts anyway. Or maybe they are trying to set up for the rogue gank
---
Get a boar early use its 1 sec charge stun to peel targets off you by sending it to attack something to be out of the 5yrd charge deadzone then use the gap it creates to get a concusive shot off and win.
---
Hunters are the strongest class at 19 only thing youll have a "fight" against is paladins since they get freedom and bubbles/LoH. You can 1v1 everyone else no trouble.
---
In that case it's just the Alliance being a bunch of pussies as usual.
---
Hear me out, man. A couple months before launch while you were playing BFA, one of the popular conversations was "when will the tourists dip out" and the general consensus was that they would leave in 3 waves. 3days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. Here we are at 3 months. Just turn into the skid, bro. Go play fortnite for a bit and before you know it shadow lands will be out and you'll have all sorts of new shit to whine about.
---
This is the issue. When people are stuck in traffic on the highway, they hate the traffic. They fail to realize that they’re part of the traffic. Similarly, people farm honor thinking their actions have no effect on the server’s well-being.
---
More factions wouldve made sense lorewise aswell
---
Can someone please explain what's going on with all this?  I hear Alliance are abandoning entire servers.  What's happening?!  How is that even possible or planned?  I'm on a PVE server and everything is as amazing as it has been since launch.
---
Warrior sucks to lvl solo but is awesome at 60 because everyone needs a tank.
---
If it was like a regular queue where you wait &lt;10 min, I think people would just wait the 10 min everyday rather than faction swap.
---
Ye. It didnt grow stronger in vanilla, and fkn death coil could not crit. Half of warlock class still has legion funxtions
---
Imagine if someone went back in time and told the blizzard devs what that single game would launch. Nobody would have believed.
---
Good question, but yeah it is just about having fun in the end.
---
Good. Horde deserve it.
---
This is a sob story they want you to believe.  There is no one there left to straighten the story out and argue for reality.  This is “the legend of flamelash” that no one can confirm nor deny.
---
I don't really care about that. This is Classic and it is deteriorating. I've spoken to a few people in Discord who are considering quitting. Hardcore types who had planned to play for two years. They aren't whining about it...they're just resigned. They still love the game but the only playstyle available in the open world is to make a raid group, win for 5-15 minutes, get overwhelmed, and then try to rez for 15 minutes. So they don't do that and they don't really want to play anymore. Neither do it. This is a situation begging for balance.
---
Perhaps, but sometimes the dot ticks can occur in phases and thus interrupt things like first aid, or cannibalize.
---
And I've just noticed that I am sometimes lying there dead and see them barely survive because they manage to just get off one first aid tick, or one cannibalize tick etc.
---
Its just painful to watch.
---
Then they both come to this subreddit to bitch up a storm and nothing gets fixed because if there was a simple fucking fix it probably would be fixed and there wasn’t really a problem to begin with.
---
Did you think I was too stupid to know what a yougoogly was?
---
Also don’t PWS warriors unless you absolutely have to. It blocks their rage generation.
---
Ally on Mograine here. 45 min corpse run to BRM, and still counting since our lock is still trying to get here. Don't worry, it's happening to both factions.
---
For something you invested 140-200 hours is I'd definitely say it's worth €25 when available
---
Did you even read what I wrote...
---
What exactly is 1 thorium grenade going to do against 5 shamans?
---
Pretty sure Blizzard has NEVER merged servers, even in retail. I doubt this was ever an option to begin with. I’m not sure why players are even bringing it up tbh. Would be a huge nightmare for Blizzard to implement. And the amount of people that would complain about losing their names, guild names, and Blizzard forcing them into a different server? Hoooo boy.
---
I’m pretty sure that Blizzard thought a lot more people wouldn’t make it to 60. So they used a higher server population to ensure that the servers still had a healthy community after all the tourists left. They were wrong, but so were we. People on this sub act like we saw third coming from a mile away. We didn’t lol.
---
Not very Christ of you
---
The point of a model is not to perfectly mimic reality, it's to help predict or understand a phenomenon. Real life infantry/naval battles have mixed members and people not engaged in firing 100% of the time, but they still teach Lanchester's Law at every military academy in the world. The model is still useful because it explains an aspect of an actual observed phenomenon, which is that small advantages in numbers can very often result in enormous victories.
---
But it's mostly the players. In particular, horde players, that ruined the game. Every full sever that's super horde dominated gets FREE TRANSFERS FOR HORDE, FREE. And Horde don't take it. Why haven't horde taken it? Because it's way easier to just run around in groups of 100 and roll your fat face on the keyboard then it is to get decent at the game and play in a fair setting. 
---
I quit the game 2 weeks ago. Because of that bullshit. Working 6 days a week 10+ hours a day, i dont have the time or desire to stand around and be fun for the horde losers. I want to have fun. I wanted to relax and play with my friends on my downtime. But Horde players ruined it. So, thanks a lot, gfys.
---
thank you for your detailed answer!
---
There are at least two on Rattlegore
---
Sitting pretty at 56/44 on thunderfurry.
---
Yea theyre so dumb “casually buys wow subscription while preordering shadowlands, d4 and wc3 remake”
---
Thank you.. apparently it was user error &gt; &lt;
---
My sound would shut off as soon as I'd hit launch. I guess I muted wow thru my PC some how, i dont recall how. Back to grinding , with some sound lmao.
---
That's not everyone's fault, but the fault of some greedy capitalists. The majority of people care about the world we live in.
---
DPS and damage per rage are two different things. Rend is pathetic DPS, but it's very efficient damage per rage. It is worth using if you can get the full duration out of it and debuffs are not an issue (i.e. outside of raids).
---
The entire world is safe for the care bear horde lol.
---
Probably more because back in the day they literally wiped their ass with their left hand. They still do this in some countries.
---

This is good start for bear tanking. Everything here you can get without stepping into anything bigger than a 5 man, except for mark of tyranny which requires a UBRS run. Note: Ring of Protection  **is not optional**. It is a simple quest reward and not replaced until literally nearly the end of classic. Mark of Tyranny is mutually exclusive with Blackhand's Breath. The first is the best tank trinket in all of classic while the second is the best dps trinket for a pretty long time, so choose wisely. You can get a Warbear Harness made in place of farming a Mixologist's Tunic, although the tunic will make farming as cat faster.
---
Protip: when tanking 5 man dungeons, every dungeon is Burger King because you're having it you're way. Build your group so that yiu have minimal loot competition. I.e. NO ROGUES and ideally no fury warriors depending on what item you're looking for. I'm not saying to shoo them away bit if a mage and rogue whisper you at the same time, maybe you whisper the mage back first ya know?
---
There is a huge middle ground there, dont you think? Doesn't have to just be templates or take gear out of the equation to not be what it is in classic.
---
There are flaws with tbc, but raiders being able to stomp pvpers without knowing how to pvp is 100% not one of them. The fact that people actually complain that they can't do that is mind boggling to me
---
Source on that?
---
Rank is based on total honor gained.  The honor you gain from BGs does count toward your rank, you will just only be competing for rank against the people on your server.  So, you're right about honor rank being server specific, but you're wrong in thinking you can't rank up by only competing in cross-realm BGs.
---
None who wanted to drop the gold on it.
---
Why do graphic designers tend to flip images while creating them?
---
That's the whole point! People need an incentive to switch or there is never a reason to faction transfer in the first place. That's why Horde aren't fleeing Stalagg for Heartseeker - why would they? Things are good for the Horde on Stalagg. Without some external pressure, people will stay where they are comfortable and the spiral will continue. 
---
I hold no allegiance to either the Horde or the Alliance. I wanted to play Alliance, all of my friends wanted Horde but most of them have quit since launch. I would gladly take a faction transfer over 2hr+ queues. And there are plenty of people like me. 
---
Sure you'll have your sweaty "for the Horde/Alliance" types but there are tons of us who just want to play on a balanced PvP server and dont care which faction.
---
Infamy
---
talents and itemization really changed the leveling scene compared to pre-1.10, for the better i think
---
No way lol it's way to overpopulated as is.
---
I think OP wants to play a game with more than 10 active players...
---
I'm all for #nochanges in the game mechanics themselves, but Blizzard REALLY shouldn't have let faction imbalance get that bad on the servers. Blizzard should have stopped letting people join the horde side of PVP servers when it hit 40/60. Either go to a different server, or play Alliance. It shouldn't be up to the players themselves to have to consciously decide "Hmm I want to play a Tauren but I've heard this server is pretty heavily weighted towards Horde, which will give me an unfair advantage when phase 2 drops. This will foster an unhealthy social dynamic on the server, so for the greater good I should play a gnome". It's not the players responsibility to limit their own enjoyment for the greater good of the server as a whole, Blizzard should take responsibility for being the ones to let it go completely off the rails.
---
I don't even play on a PvP server, but I hate all these people blaming the people playing the game in a sensible way for being what ruined the pvp experience. If the game encourages people to take any opportunity they can to gain honour by killing members of the opposing faction, and the factions are heavily weighted towards one side, OF COURSE it's going to result in gank city. Even if only 10% of the players cared about PVP ON A PVP SERVER that would still make ganking insanely common. It's not the fault of the players that the design of the game is pressuring them into being sociopaths.
---
Why do people still defend Blizzard so passionately in 2019?
---
Yeah, that’s why I stopped leveling at 13 until I could get a more concrete idea of what pet I should go with. Thanks.
---
So that seems to support what I was saying. They designed the world, found out it felt too empty and increased it to the point of breaking their machines. For all we know, if the servers could have handled 5000 concurrent players, they may have went with that.
---
DM North East spam,mining, buying cloth sell bandages, herb
---
I always find it hilarious that people think "I can't shitcan pvpers with pve gear" is an actual flaw with tbc.
---
I know, sometimes it can be kinda funny but I don’t really know what motivates these guys
---
Ash is only second in the world on Classic too. A fella on the Korean servers beat us to it.
---
Yes the server got destroyed. But for a beautiful moment in time we created a lot of honor for ranking players
---
My advice is to level an alt on the server you'd like to eventually transfer to. Given the state of Flamelash, I'm convinced Blizzard will hand out free transfers to the server of your choice once they shut down Flamelash entirely.
---
Nice! ust got my avg perf best to 97.8, pretty stoked
---
Again, you still dont answer my question. Should 75% of the horde not play the game like it is intended to play it? And what consequences, there are no consequences at all.
---
You are welcome.
---
Got it. I play on a PVE server so I don't have it.
---
The mongols siege and raze the snowy city of Moscow (1238)
---
War doesnt bring more benefits than peace
---
They did... in TBC.
---
You’ve been saying it since launch that the servers would be much bigger or did Blizzard literally tell us all that?
---
Without being able to increase the bitrate the vid looks blocky on 4k displays. This is the inherit issue issue with up scaling.
---
Sure TBC would be popular but if they do that they run themselves into a dead end.
---
What happens after TBC runs out of content? Wotlk? Its not classic anymore even though I liked wrath it kind of defeats the purpose. TBC is where most people would draw the line.
---
Its GG at that point. Game will definitely die without updates. TBC is great "short term" plan and would make them tons of money but classic+ has potential to go for 5+ years easily.
---
Imagine that Old school runescape started out as "old school" and yet it has now been going strong for nearly 7 years even though the game had close to nothing to do with the 2007 form it was released yes but the key factori s that it for the most part follows the fundamentals why we liked OSRS and not Runescape 3.
---
So while different classic+ would be like old school and not like Runescape 3 (retail WoW) and it could last indefinitely opposed to just TBC
---
This was probably the most alliance I’ve seen in IF for a long time. Friday night is a busier time
---
Guess so.  Well good luck tryharding against greens that basically have to fight a raid boss.  
---
What's the honor against green targets? I thought it was like 1-2 honor per kill lol
---
Question about shadow priest bis, supposedly for wrist they are either flame weave cuffs or tear fall bracers. Both of which have random enchantments. I am not a big fan of farming random enchantment pieces and I’m currently rocking dreadmist bracers. 
---
Does anyone have suggestions for other wrist pieces?
---
Imagine if a guild like APES transferred to a server like this, they could produce some hilarious content.
---
On wc logs it's to all other people within your class who have logs recorded
---
I think a large portion of classic players play classic because retail is such an abomination, though. We want leveling to be difficult. We want it to be difficult to get certain items. Etc.
---
So unless Shadowlands is a big step in that direction, a lot of us won't be playing it.
---
Literally!
---
It's not even just racials, a lot of people play warrior and want to play with shamans
---
One reason is that if you're working on the same piece for hours and hours your brain stops seeing things that are obvious to someone with fresh eyes on the piece. Flipping the canvas is an easy way to literally see it from a different perspective and realise "oh that eye is too low" or "that arm is wayyyy too long".
---
In my case  I just wasn't checking my reference when I started and put the characters on the wrong side for the iconic "Horde vs Alliance" pose so I had to swap them back.
---
I agree on some points but I don't think a third faction would help that much. I do like the dynamic of three teams but PlanetSide doesn't lock you into playing as the same faction everyday.
---
A three faction system means (ideally) only 33% of the server is friendly to you and can party up to mount counter-PvP in an organized way. That means each server needs 50% more PvP guilds running, further fracturing a server's PvP efforts. Any transition to a 3 faction system in world of Warcraft and that new third faction work be a deserted mess.
---
PlanetSide, for most that play it, is more about death balling around as a superior numbers army than WoW classic. The only difference is you can teleport to a different battle against a different color opponent if you are losing. 
---
PlanetSide also has soft faction caps.
---
HEY GUYS LETS HAVE LIKE THE 10,000TH THREAD ABOUT THIS AGAIN HAHA THAT SHOULD BE FUN
---
Because people like Corpsegrinder are the type of meatheads who play Horde?
---
What is going on? I am out of the loop.
---
Lol
---
Everyone should care.  Bots royally screw up the economy.
---
Shaking with the left hand is a sign of disrespect, is this right for the wrong reasons or the right reasons?
---
What is off the docks at shadow prey?  What are the bots farming?
---
Great way to get blackmailed. Whoever scoops it up can just sit on it and demand more free stuff.
---
But what does that do for servers like Stalagg that is 75:25?
---
You'll StalaggA will be a perfect 50:50 and Stalagg will be 100:0 Horde. People can still do dungeons, farm mobs, etc. There is little compulsion to faction transfer. StalaggB might actually be easier to farm on without 1:1 Alliance lol.
---
Multi-arena and RBG glad here, so I think I learned how to pvp properly.  I enjoy wPvP, so I rolled on a pvp server where my faction is outnumbered 2:1 at 60.  When my guild plays together, we have little trouble handling world pvp and even spend a fair amount of time terrorizing horde players across the world map.
---
That said, I don't blame folks who have limited time to play and don't want to spend 40+ minutes corpse running to BRM because it's completely locked down by horde players along the entire route.  That's not fun, and it's completely unavoidable.  It's not something that can be fixed by playing better.  It can only be fixed by getting 5-40 other people to help you, and even then you'll likely die a few times.  
---
It's not fun to die as soon as you land at any FP in the Plaguelands where you are then camped for 10-15 minutes.  While we can fly to safer zones and ride in, I don't think it's reasonable to say that folks who are frustrated and leaving the server/taking time off are doing so because they are crybabies who didn't learn how to pvp.

I'm not sure why you're so butthurt because the top post compared you to a child (apparently rightfully so).  It's an apt comparison.  Players on the dominant faction were given something they enjoy (the pvp system) and they used it in a way that made it more difficult (or impossible) to keep using.  Rather than just fighting out in the open world or creating the old roving gank squad of 5-10 people, the dominant faction is camping zeppelins/boats or FPs or otherwise making it impossible for players to level in 48+ zones.  That will disincentivize people from going to those zones or even logging on, and the HKs will become more scarce.  That's not a Blizzard systems problem (other than increasing the server pop cap), that's a player use of those systems problem.  That Blizzard could make changes to the game to ameliorate the issue doesn't absolve the players of the responsibility for driving other players away from the game.
---
Yeah, that they would most likely survive anyways, in a vacuum. Which might be correct, but applying a 24 sec duration DoT at the last second before you die surely makes them more vulnerable, and more likely die in most scenarios.
---
and I don't know how much stronger the later procs are than the early ones, but if lets say you have a 1 sec agony duration left just before you are about to get stunned for 5 seconds, I am pretty sure the full duration agony would end up doing more damage in that important time period.
---
Overall, worse than private servers ironically. 
---
1) Layering was a bummer
---
2) Dungeon XP and spellcleave meta tainted leveling 
---
3) Non-progressive gear trivializing MC/Ony
---
4) Phase 2 is a mess for all the obvious reasons 
---
I preferred the bugs that came with private servers over the design decisions here. Private servers had more flexibility, Nost specifically made some changes on the fly for the betterment of the game. 
---
It's fine though, I accept it and play anyway
---
Yea it is hard on people who don't do it, that is for sure.   At least they are easy to kill.  Fearing them really screws things up, so does killing the leader.
---
Loved reading this. Loved it, but this poor bastard will not make it to 60. Maybe by 2021.
---
Trolling, my friend. Simply trolling. I don’t even play on that server.
---
Yeah but dying to guards does. Do the pyro rez bombers never get killed by guards?
---
This is 90% of the bitching about wow.
---
[Just a lazy artist :P](https://imgur.com/vNBtCue)
---
Because Heartseeker alliance aren’t sociopaths like most horde on PvP servers.
---
Well when the data is not 100% its not accurate- then its a bullshit data cuz how you can trust? If its not complete and trusted. Blizzard is hiding those numbers and you are saying its based of logs ...of raiders... what about people who havent leveled yet?
---
Ret pally is playable, don't let anyone tell you otherwise, but unless youre lucky and get the epicsword from stratholm you will always play second fiddle to better classes.
---
You should probably try not to be willfully blind. Just yesterday I saw 3 posts on the official forums that were complaining about faction balance. All 3 were horde complaining about Heartseeker. Every single thread about game imbalance has a flood of Horde players justifying that any imbalance on every other server is off set completely by the imbalance on Heartseeker. Literally its the Horde Macguffin for realm balance.
---
E, R, and T are great as well

Swimming isn't exactly a prime activity in WoW, but when one does have to swim, the trinket is very good for non-druids. It gives underwater breathing and more speed than [Azure Silk Belt](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7052/azure-silk-belt) and is not consumed like [Swim Speed Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6372/swim-speed-potion) (afaik stacks with trinket). It is effectively the best item in the game for its niche.
---
On the other hand, all the other rewards from the contest are for +fishing skill, which is borderline useless. The highest fishing skill requirement in the game is 425, which is attainable by the Horde without the contest, though Alliance can only get up to 422 currently.
---
You guys not only toxic waste, you also suck at the easiest pve in the history of wow
---
Imbalance
---
Every single pvp server is horde majority. The mega servers huge horde population. 
---
Only alliance dominated servers are relatively small and or PvE. 
---
Doesn't matter if it's cross realm if 20000 hordes are queueing and only 5000 allies are.
---
Base what on? That it's from logs? If so that's because the site even says so, the alliance thing I assume is because people normally go alliance for PvE and would thus be more likely to log.
---
Blizzard was in a no win situation. You know 100% if they didn't release wPvP honor people would be up in arms about them already ruining the game and denying a super fun system to play. There would be 5 posts on the front page each guilded 6 times about some "wAcKy AnD zAnY" wPvP adventure some guy vaguely remembers having back in vanilla. "Someone would gank someone else, then they bring their guilds over and you'd have these epic showndowns that build a sense of community!!"
---
Reality is the honor system is an abysmal mess and a testament to how gaming and it's standards have evolved. They really should have just limited honor to BGs. That way wPvP is still a thing and all the tryhard grinders sniping level 50s in gadgetzan inn and roaming around with 6 people to farm anyone they outnumber can fuck off
---
Why is it two weeks into this, some people still fail to understand that the much higher population caps did in fact not give players what they wanted and have a dramatic impact on the game?
---
Im on Ashbringer. I love PvP but how can you really defend being corpse camped by 10 Hordies as something you signed up for?
---
If people had the option to switch to PvE servers then they would be all full within days max.
---
Our behavior = idiots who chose to play on a PVP server but don’t want to PVP
---
If you come to noggenfogger ill get you an active guild, some gold and dungeon help friend. 
---
Sorry for your situation
---
I think camping flight paths, major cities, or a hearth point is asshole behavior. Most people have sympathy for people who die in those places because those aren’t reasonable places to be expected to world pvp. I know the game allows you to kill people in those places, but just because you can kill people who have just landed at a flight point with a group of 5, doesn’t mean you should. Same goes for people who sit in IF waiting for people to come back to the city still flagged for pvp.
---
Stop feeding the new troll account.
---
That's cool man. Kinda wish I rolled pve at the beginning too. I played in vanilla and pvp servers weren't this insane. Plus I'm older so I just want to chill and farm gold in peace without groups of 5 allies REEE-ing into my face. 
---
Glad you're having fun ! The pve server is just as valid a playing experience as the pvp server imo.
---
RATTLE GANG
---
My turn to repost this tomorrow
---
Except Blizzard said they would keep population caps at Vanilla-era values, or do you believe the 3rd party census addons instead of Hazzikostas?
---
Yeah, xrealm bgs are a solution for low pop servers and sub 60 bgs to have shorter queues. It changes nothing for factions.
---
Ummm no not at all....
---
Does this affect PvE servers too?
---
yes you should because its the highest honor/hour.
---
blame the glame. blame the scuffed servers release. blame not having BGs with the start of pvp season.
---
Two of them do actually. Dude apparently raids with this setup?
---
Its you own fault, that server was already dogshit 2 months ago. Its your own fault for abandoning the sinking ship earlier.
---
I'm on this server. The horde are evil.
---
Good point. Perhaps you'd turn the respawn rates down even further than 1/2. Like 1/4th or even 1/10th. It would need a thorough looking over to make sure that there is no aspect of being on an overflow layer that offers a superior experience to the regular server.
---
I can’t parse any sense from your comment, but I think it’s funny that someone playing a PvP rogue is complaining about uncharitable behavior.
---
Sorry you’re having trouble finding people to kill from stunlock. Your life sounds very hard.
---
[You enjoy all the killing, that's why!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efEXuSkrwXE)

Not for mitigation?
---
Bartender is a huge QOL improvement for me. Being able to clean up my bars, add/remove buttons, quickly remind the keys, change the size of said buttons, etc is a must for me.
---
GRID is also another big one. If you’re a healer and looking to improve your game a ton, grid with mouse over macros is the way to go!
---
"The problem is that Ally isn't PvPing" "Exactly"
---
"We should ban Spy"
---
These issues do not correlate.
---
Yikes no. Blizzard has fukl control over yhe game and could regulate population. THEY STILL CAN RIGHT NOW. Its completely on Blizzard to maintain the game
---
Love me some anime tiddies
---
If I were a horde on this realm I'd fucking reroll lmao. It's not even a PvE server, it's actually a dead realm.
---
Always a cat. Fast attack speed is great for interrupting casters.
---
Agree 100%.
---
I’m quite relaxed, just trying to have a discussion on the topic but if you don’t want then no problem
---
His take tells me he's on the dominant faction on an unbalanced server. I promise he'd think differently if the tables were turned.
---
My guild also has 4 bindings and have only been clearing MC for 8 weeks
---
I play Shazzrah Horde. I'd rather have faction balance switched around. Yes I do pvp, and I also know some alliance pvpers, they do have it better. If you actually know what you are doing, you are competetive and into pvp it's better to be on the lower side of pop.
---
Even the lowest pop realms are higher pop than original vanilla
---
No. And don’t listen to the crybabies on this subreddit that say otherwise.
---
And that's why people will take advantage of you all your life because you expect others to not take advantage of a flawed system.
---
You guys have 4 bindings already? I’m jelly
---
Literally never interacted with anyone on alliance who even gave the impression of being a teenager.
---
You still have to move away if you pop ice block.
---
Oh yeah, I'm not hating. It's impressive really. All of his toons are pretty well geared too, they even have a couple of MC shoulders between them.
---
nobody asked for such overcrowded servers. nobody asked for layering. launch was already a COMPLETE mess, name reservation alone was the biggest fail I’ve seen in some time from blizzard. 
---
Whatever I think it will probably end like most pservers, the experience is not too different, players act the same and that means they will either quit or demand TBC/Classic+ once AQ is there for some time. Most players don’t realize how content will evolve and how much effort it is to stay competitive, and from what I see most people nowadays want to be competitive in some way, they will surely burn out.
---
Lose is the wrong word. There was a horrible ratio all along, and when the honor system kicked in this was inevitable.
---
I agree that it sucks for both factions, when I said it was okay I basically just meant that both factions dominate some zones rather than one faction dominating all of them. 
---
Just yesterday I tried to get to Dire Maul and died 10 times on my way through feralas from the flight master because there were like 3x7man death squads running around and I imagine it's the same for hordes in other zones.
---
That's pretty much what I just said? That they wouldn't be hard, but a flat number increase across the board will obviously make any fight a little more difficult.
---
I think that if you have ample hit elsewhere, the bow is better. Not sure though.
---
&gt; 45/55
---
According to [wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community?webhook) Flamelash was 38/62 A/H on 14th Sept. already. That's not even 3 weeks after release.  
---
The Horde GM who made the original post is full of shit.
---
I can't speak specifically to how an enhancement shaman, but I imagine it is similar to a ret paladin.
---
You can't stand with the rest of the melee group.  You and the rest of the mana using melee characters need to stand in their own seperate spot far enough away from the tanks and melee blob that if you get hit with the lava blast you don't chain that onto the rest of the melee group or the tank.  It's the same ability that forces the range DPS characters to spread out.  That ability specifically targets mana users, not just players outside of melee.  
---
If the tank is at 12 o'clock, and the melee blob is at 6 o'clock, you and the rest of the enh shamans need to stack at 9 o'clock.  You'll still need to move in and out of his melee range to avoid Wrath of Raganros.  But it does end up positioning you close enough that you should be able to drop totems for the melee guys so make sure your groups are set up accordingly.
---
It's a catch-22.
---
Imbalanced servers? Bad. Telling people they cannot play their preferred faction because the server is imbalanced? Also bad.
---
There's just no solution to this that doesn't end in some portion of people REEEEEEEing.
---
You tried to flip it back on me like I'm the griefer with your own assumptions, wow it's almost like your just a disingenuous troll, moving along.
---
That's why I say that your solution is too complicated and doesn't apply enough external pressure to do anything. People will always find a way around the system. 
---
"Oh, I'm on StalaggB? Guess I'll just run dungeons or BG until I get moved over."
---
No one is going to say, "Aww. Fire elementals are taking an extra 60 seconds to respawn! Better faction transfer."
---
Sorry for the loud cackle...it was 3am and I was pretty slappyhappy at this point lol
---
I'm horde and I am probably going to reroll pve. I just have no interest.
---
Sit out a month of pvp'ing to do what? raidlog once a week? There's no content right now that we haven't done a thousand times.
---
Of course!
---
they post on forums about how classic is stale with nothing to do
---
Yeah. You’ll still have fun. I don’t get much time either so I’m only level 44 but absolutely loving it.
---
🦀$11🦀
---
Have you taken a look at retails balance? They do NOT balance themselves, they get progressively worse as time goes on.
---
&lt;The Dark Blade&gt; on Bloodsail Buccaneers is recruiting your lost and weary.
---
yeah just don't waste your time rolling alliance on a pvp server
---
You knew beforehand that servers were going to have larger populations than retail vanilla and you still chose to roll on a pvp realm anyway
---
You made your bed, now lie in it.
---
Come to a PVE server. I rerolled like 2 weeks ago, I have my mount on my warrior already. I prefer the normal server as I can choose when I want to PVP. Being new to wow wasn't cool because I didn't know how shit it would be. But I'm having a blast again like I was in phase one. If you come to bloodsail buccs on alliance side, I have a awesome guild who will get you set up.
---
The irony.
---
All the twitch zoomers went horde.
---
Guild Ward 2 had "overflow" and it was the best idea id had ever seen
---
Because this isn't the point. The majority of PvP servers are horde dominant. Sure there are alliance dominated servers and the alliance there are doing the same thing. Ganking in org, camping kargath, BrM etc. The issue is not the faction but the dominant faction on most servers. If the commentary is about the issue at large it make sense to represent this in the context the majority of people experience (i.e. Horde dominant). "Defending the Horde" here makes you look like your are defending the actions that in extreme circumstances has actually killed a PvP server. We are trying to raise a concern through our voice to the developers of a game we want fixed. Just because we don't have a great idea to solve it doesn't mean we shouldn't voice the concerns. Even if he had the end all solution, it's doesn't mean blizzard would listen. Ultimately the Community believes Blizzard needs to address this in some way. All we are trying to do with repeated posts about this topic is show Blizz that it is not a small impact or over exaggeration.
---
Lastly,
---
I implore anyone who is the dominant faction on a server complaining there is nothing to do. Go reroll on another server as the minority faction. Until you truly understand what is happening it's easy to dismiss the sentiment of other players.
---
I hope this was coherent and none emotional enough for you.
---
There's no way you're gonna corpse camp a rogue, addons or not. The rogue an just res and instastealth.
---
Look, if you wanna play, just do it. It doesn't matter how much you progress if you're having fun, right?
---
Yea, with all the Top WoW Twitch Streamers going Horde!
---
The actual irony
---
Ahhhh, makes sense. Tyty
---
"Geared" in this case refers to how much stamina gear (with appropriate amounts of offensive stats as well) you're running. You can have all the lionheart helms and truestrike shoulders you want, but if you don't run a ton of stamina, you're making a mistake in pvp.
---
Ally pretty strong on my server
---
&gt; while doing as little as humanly possible.
---
.....he says, after there have been like 10-15 different bug fixes and patches to the game in the past 3 months.
---
Seriously, you people are entitled as fuck. The second something goes wrong, you screech that Blizzard is "doing nothing". It's sickening.
---
K sociopath
---
Good. Fuck the horde. They wouldn't listen, so it is deserving.
---
Really? Would you like to play a game where 75% of your time played is spent running back to your corpse? Sure sounds fun, doesn't it?
---
&gt; A lot of people that neglected or ignored retail will buy it now that they are invested in wow again.
---
Nah that isn't true. I haven't 'invested' in WoW. I have been playing Classic. I haven't had a desire to play the game since Wrath, similar with most of the people I have met - zero desire to play retail whatsoever. For most people who "came back" we will shrug and just quit when we lose interest.
---
So these people love crippling themselves? Warrior without a pocket paladin is like half a warrior.
---
? This is a gear question. The answer is: not 8pc might. Don’t make it your goal to get any sort of might set bonus. If you collect it accidentally, go for it, but it shouldn’t be your priority, it’s bad. Just look at the FC lists if you want to know roughly what “bis” is. You should be collecting threat gear as priority, and that does NOT MEAN MIGHT.
---
No sympathy at all. Don’t play on a pvp server.....
---
That’s why I don’t do pugs with shitters like you :)
---
so is it #nochanges or #somechanges ? first you want them to make no changes, now you want them to make big changes
---
I have - my server has ally majority- I always jump in
---
flamelashed is the new word for wipes and large scale failures.
---
&gt;dungeons were better
---
Not in my opinion. TBC ended the style of 1-2 hour labyrinths in favor of 30 minute loot hallways. I *liked* how each dungeon had it's own style instead of each being a linear, streamlined experience.
---
Spy tells you where enemies are. It's a bullshit, cheating add on. Pet classes can target players, send their pets to attack, and then just follow their pets to the person. It's so absurdly broken.
---
The real problem is that Horde have superior pvp racials. Undead passive is a better version of the pvp trinket, Orcs get 25% to avoid stuns and pet damange, Troll/Orc is the best hunter race, Tuarens are better druids because of their aoe stun. Alliance have Gnomes with an escape and Humans with +mace/sword skill. Thats what causes the imbalance.
---
They also upped the server caps by a factor of 10 (or more), and added layering.
---
I personally don't think it is such a long stretch for them to shutdown certain dead servers after all that.
---
Merge them with Skeram.  What's the real difference between a 20v1 and a 40v1?
---
This sub needs more of this :)
---
Even APES would get stomped 20v1.
---
There's no fairness because life isn't fair?
---
So I guess in real war, you'd let your comrade die right next to you and do nothing about it.
---
Damn boi you are fucked up, #halp.
---
Server already 40/60 and they open transfer for both factions lmao, who would have thought that the dominated faction will leave while the dominating faction won’t even bother. Why would
---
you go from 60/40 to 30/70? 
---
That’s something only the real PvPer will bother do to, to have a bigger challenge, problem here is that those “try hard” PvPer already set their R13/R14 brackets up, to get a lot of high Ranks relatively quick, those guys will never leave their server, because they need at least 6 months to set up the new server like this. 
---
The ranking system is just broken for nowadays, most good players know that it’s not skilled what they do, they just have to do because of the system.
---
Better than the main wow reddit blaming horde players for everything.
---
So depending whether you are horde or alliance will determine the difficulty. The single best level 19 twink pet and (best pet imo all the way through) is The Rake. This majestic beast spawns in the north eastern part of thunderbluff alone. (A Tauren main city). This lion is the coolest and fastest lion in Azeroth. With a WHOPPING 1.2 Attack speed which will make any caster revere you as their god. Highly recommend you get this as this is the best pet for a twink.
---
Because only like 5% of the player base uses reddit?
---
Ah - he changed the op from “I don’t even play classic anymore “
---
You know what else can do that? /target Player. It's not unique to Spy, as long as someone sees your name appear in the Combat Log they can find you.
---
Faction change could be realm wide. Like, you can only faction change all you characters on the realm at the same time. Not individual characters.
---
Cool!
---
I doubt you can get 60 there even in a year. Even as NElf.
---
Or they should've implemented BG's after 2 weeks and not wait 4-5 weeks making everyone completely sick of the open world.
---
Green Of shadow wrath
---
Good to see that there is precedent for it.
---
lvl 54 gnome farming satyrs. Popped him with one aimed shot to get my mobs back. Feels good to be on a pvp server
---
Someone is selling bread to no one
---
That is just plain wrong. Sorry. There needs to be a minimum of people on your server actively PvPing for there to exist enough brackets for r14. I cannot remember the exact number, but if there is less than (I think) 300 active PvPers each week on a realm, r14 will be impossible. And even in that scenario you need to be in the highest bracket, which will probably be 1 or 2, people each week.
---
It actually is the same in feralas for us Aswell
---
Lol oh come on. Retail is way more populated than Classic
---
Stun them all because he is a multiboxer
---
&gt; the amount of money and dedication to just try is still going to take way too long.
---
You're coming at this from a normal player's perspective. Some people absolutely will do those things and more.
---
Shellfish from the traps. Every 5 = 55s. I've been watching a hunter bot it nearly 24/7 for weeks.
---
It’s a dick move but it’s a fucking video game. If you think someone is a sociopath for spawncamping in a video game then I think you need to stop playing games because you take them too seriously
---
Definitely been a challenge getting into dm for me on Kromcrush on the occasion. Also had to fend off occasional alliance tying to pick people off leaving the camp.
---
That's probably true. They are 100% ego gamers. They'd rather run around in 40 man raid groups getting shit honor as they kill 3-10 man Ally groups with no risk of dying, than risk dying in a 10-man and get WAY higher honor/hr, but have to corpserun 1 once an hour. 
---
Its WAY better honor to be in a 5-man group, kill 50 people in 50 minutes and be dead the other 10, than to be in a 40-man raid and kill 300 people in an hour and never die.
---
Hey, that’s my guild!
---
Blizzard get hundreds of reports per server every day and a few thousand overall.
---
I am curious to hear how you would sort this out to have enough manpower to go through all the reports and make GMs fly out to these "hotspots".
---
There are also many false reports and I wouldn't trust one person to play god and ban anyone they think is a bot. I have been accused and reported (so the guy said) for botting because I was mindlesly grinding harpies in the same circle for hours in Feralas. Despite replying instantly to his whispers and talking like a normal human he claimed I had it all set up. Luckily nothing came of it.
---
It's only right that Blizzard ban in waves and take their time with banning until they are certain. That way they also do the most damage to these developers.
---
what's toxic about pvping for honor on a pvp server. And please don't point at this video, this is the \*result\* of everyone transferring off. Not the cause. Because that didn't happen before everyone left.
---
/tar player
---
/cast instant
---
if you stand near their body and spam this macro you will tag the rogue before they can stealth
---
The economy is utter trash, too. You can't make money, the resources are still vanilla pop levels of variety, but there are so many players, supply on everything is bloated... But mounts are still a jillion gold.
---
Or you’re too dumb to realize it’s just funny
---
Sad.  People are staying logged in pvping all day and when they hit rank 11 they will need all day and night plus a capable honor farm group to even sniff those weapons since the populations of servers are 3-4x vanilla.
---
&gt;blame the game.
---
What kind of messed up person can enjoy such a "game"?
---
..and the Wowhead versions of it just came up!

Enjoy :)
---
Bingo!
---
So stupid
---
Blizzard banning bots and gold sellers would make the problem worse? That’s a hot take.
---
To a small degree sure. But overall server populations is why it is so bad. This game was not created with current populations in mind.
---
I had no idea. Playing casually whenever I could (3+ months of subscription for just one level 55 priest)... I was rarely ever ganked, there were always ally around for dungeons, AH was stacked, etc.

30, its 5% base + the extra 25% from the racial

horde #1

Legendary douche
---
I’m just happy Eris is a sanctuary and people are actually nice enough to let me finish my benediction quest :) I made sure to make a note of each of them there and will be on a friendly list. Also managed to mind control them and give them pally wisdom buff to help em out.
---
Do people not know classic is on an updated engine.  Vanilla didn’t look anywhere as nice as it does now.
---
Long queues for a faction means that faction continuing to world pvp in between queues.. Be careful what you wish for
---
it has pathetic damage per rage because it cant crit. So no its not the best damage per rage, not even close.
---
&gt;How it looks    
---
or    
---
&gt;What it looks like
---
For the 600,000th time: spiders dont shoot webs in classic.
---
I was providing support to your previous response.  But thanks for the feedback anyhow
---
&gt; Tribalism is a big yikes from me.
---
i fixed this for you
---
Has a faction ever been so thoroughly dominated in wow history? Schlonged
---
its not highest damage per rage as it can not crit.
---
It is really easy.  The botters all use the same profiles, and will always flock to the most lucrative spots.  Just do spot checks on those spots and look for bots.  If you find their profiles, you find their bots.  It isn't that hard.
---
&gt; GY camp and refuse to end the game for an hour.
---
With no honor after the 4th HK why would they drag out WSG to give them ultimately less HPH?
---
Yeah pls stop crying, already! Yeah the server is dead on ally side, we know this by now, blizzard knows it, even MY GRANDMA KNOWS IT!
---
You are playing on a new server we get it! Horde cant get any more honor, nice. Its official, its the first real dead server, 103 days after release, WOHU! Now get some cookies and enjoy your new server, it wont be the last server, but guess what?!?!
---
IT HAPPENS 15 YEARS BACK ALSO THAT ALL SERVERS WHERE KINDA UNBALANCED AS SHIT!
---
Back in Vanilla it was fun!   
---
The populations were much much lower. On my Server there was actually one BG group on Alliance side with R10+Players.   
---
There was another one for those behind and that's about it.    
---
Before realmpool BGs we played vs either the main Horde Group or vs a few randoms now and then.    
---
We knew each other and who'd win 1vs1s against whom.    
---
We went over from Alliance WS queue point to the Horde one to gank them now and then.    
---
World PvP inlcuded like at most 5 kills a day and was a fun surprise during levelling or questing/farming now and then.    
---
I still love PvP during levelling now since P2, the issue is that lv48+ levelling isn't fun anymore and getting to Dungeons is a mess aswell. All due to much too high populations and no BGs.
---
But why go through all the trouble of layering and micro managing spawn rates when there is a simpler fix?
---
All I'm saying is that your solution is a bandaid on a bullet wound. We have to address the primary issue: the faction imbalance. Faction queues alone from the start would have been great but it's too late for that. There are simply too many Horde on PvP servers. Even if we spread all players out evenly, there would be an imbalance. 
---
All your plan does is take a portion of Horde players and removes them from the overworld, fracturing the playerbase but allowing them to play 90% of the game with only mild inconveniences. And with BGs coming out soon most people wont even care that there aren't Alliance running around to kill.
---
If you think pissing people off in video games makes someone a sociopath then I don’t know what to say
---
So there's battle languages?
---
nah people will get camped either way, regardless of balance.
---
Wow, that is hilarious and terrible all at the same time.  Dude is making 6gold a minute, 360g an hour....
---
How do I get DBM working? I've downloaded the addon from curseforge, extracted it and put it in my addons folder, but it's not showing up in game. I have another addon in the same folder that does work in game, so what do I do?
---
And all charm was lost
---
Look into the toilet if you want to see shit
---
It's a bit of both.  A couple more tweaks and shamans could also have been true tanks to balance out with paladins.  But the idea that you don't need to be max level to find max level or at least viable max level gear makes it more like a rpg.
---
I also disliked that personally.  I hated the feeling that there was no more transferrability between pvp and pve gear, or that only weapons continued to be transferrable between the two.  
---
Arenas were a decent idea I guess, but also making them the pinnacle of pvp I think was against the spirit of the game being an MMO.  The game was no longer about teamwork with lots of people as a pinnacle activity but suddenly about 2/3/5 man groups.  Imagine if, for example, suddenly 3 man dungeons started giving better loot than raids for comparison. 
---
The other thing about them was that WoW was closer to a rock paper scissor game before arenas.  Suddenly it mattered whether the game was balanced in a 2v2 / 3v3 / 5v5 (lol) deathmatch situation which was ultimately (imo) impossible.
---
I wish wow would get the wow3 reforged style.
---
It's so damn eye candy.
---
Kirtonos is very mild, the horde don’t have the advantage to camp IF like this, it’s just a few rogues that get camped as much as they gank. The only really annoying trips are BRM usually (tho in the last week I have walked all the way to BRD a few times with ally manning the chains etc) and DM. Also menethil is fucked
---
Are you interested in discussing the subject or are you just here to say that it’s stupid?
---
yes, i gank in enemy cities and thats basically my experience
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
Your brain is fried my guy. 
---
Blizzard introduced a system, in order to rank efficiently you have to slaughter every single person you see on the opposite faction that’s  48+. 
---
Yet you somehow put the blame on the players? It’s quite literally inefficient to NOT kill every 48+ you see on the enemy faction, assuming you haven’t killed them more than 4 times in the last 24 hours. 
---
You just expect the people pushing the top brackets to take it easy and not kill everyone? How does that make any sense?
---
I’ll get downvoted for uttering the phrase “private servers” but they tackled the honor system in a way that was much healthier for the game, allowing honor to be acquired from the start and skipping the wpvp phase. This led to much more natural pvp encounters and no post apocalyptic wasteland of raids roaming around and decimating everyone.
---
Self imposed /whoosh.
---
TLDR
---
LOOK WHAT YOU MADE US DO BLIZZARD!
---
NOW FIX THE MESS YOU MADE US MAKE!
---
Thanks for the offer! I might take you up on that, but I kinda doubt it right now.
---
There's no 1% "not-counting". You're probably thinking of the formula when the skill disparity is &gt;=10. This won't apply to level 60 enemies.
---
This. I don't care if you can't log on because you rolled horde on a 96% horde server. Fuck off the server then or roll Alliance.
---
Faction queue, Faction only xfers.
---
Also faction only xfers should have been the thing from the beginning. Factions were much more balanced initially.
---
Thank you for your thoughtful reply
---
False
---
Same reason people corpse camp lowbies despite getting no honor.
---
Just be to dicks.
---
You’re going to obviously have groups of people in BGs who are explicitly **not ranking**, either because they’ve got the rewards they want or don’t care about the rewards left to get. They’ll get more joy out of grieving honor farmers than anyone else playing WSG.
---
People that camp FPs and other shitty areas for easy honor are the same people that drive on the shoulder during rush hour because “I’M late. ME. I need to get where I’m going”
---
Probably because they still make money from bots.
---
A few queue-whiners days after launch does not prove your point.
---
Capping concurrent players (forcing queues) is only one of many ways to limit server populations, and to be frank, it's probably the least effective of the options. Faction-specific queues would be more effective, but that addresses server imbalance more than server overpopulation. 
---
There are 2 things Blizzard could have done to very effectively keep server populations in line with how they were in Vanilla, they simply chose not to. First, they could (and absolutely should) have had WAY more servers available for players to choose during the Character creation in early August (spinning up more servers days after is not at all the same, the damage was done at that point). Second, they could literally turn off character creation on realms that reach the population cap.
---
Then you'll get server factions holding servers hostage. Either one could band together and not log on, forcing the other side to not be able to play.
---
What’s improved by manually walking to a works quest everyday.
---
They changed it without any notice about it like 2 weeks before they removed layers. 
---
It used to be 60 minutes at the beginning tho.
---
Overall between all servers the faction is extremely well balanced.  I don’t think some servers are unbalanced because of some people who want to min max racials.
---
I think most “kiddos” want to be the hero paladin
---
&gt;Who cares?
---
The people who actually enjoy pvp for one. And this whole "there are other competitive games" argument isn't a good argument. Why should I go play a completely different genre of game because you want to casually pvp at the very top without putting effort in? 
---
You can go pvp for a couple hours a week and get your arena games in, anyway. If someone can't do that, then clearly they don't even like to pvp, so it doesn't even matter. Not like they are getting ganked being able to fly everywhere, anyway. This is about dominating better players through gear, and no other reason.
---
I have heard a few people advocate for raising level cap to 62 or 63 and introducing a few new dungeons and raid tiers, with possibly one or two zones. Significantly increase the time per level of the new post 60 levels. With those few levels, you could address the scaling issues with high level raid gear, while also ensuring current raid gear is still relevant and not replaced by levelling/quest gear of the new content. You could also ensure current raids are not totally trivialized and still run by players. (Though doable with fewer people.)
---
It really isn’t.   But thanks for illustrating my point.
---
Dropped from Baron Rivendare in Strat.
---
Which parts of #nochanges demanded 15k concurrent player sized realms?
---
you're joking, right? all the cool kiddies, the fotm kidders and outright bad duelers from henhouse have rolled horde
---
It's really really rare and really really useless.
---
I think the issue causing that is entirely based on the player types.
---
Not to say horde in particular are bad people.  But if your intent was to focus hard on WPvP and the honour grins you likely chose to play horde.  If you planned on being a raid logger, good chance alliance was more appealing.
---
This isn't to say one or the other is good or bad.  Just depending on the experience you were looking for you were likely swayed in a particular direction.
---
While we are closely matched from a server population standpoint I simply don't believe that alliance has nearly as much participation in WPvP as the horde does.  Which still leads to stuff like Menethil/Theramore being heavily camped by griefers, BRM being horde controlled pretty much constantly outside of popular alliance raid times and most end game zones being populated by horde "death squads"
---
That's not to say alliance doesn't WPvP, we absolutely do.  It just feels like that is a much more horde thing to do.  Could be confirmation bias though, sure feels like there are more horde out there and 30-35 of our 40 man raid roster only plays 3 hours per week.
---
&gt;Convince all the other campers to not camp IF? 
---
He could start by not doing it and then complaining in the next breath.
---
Best in slot feral tank FR weapon (which he is - you can tell by the gear). Since it's literally garbage compared to almost all other alternatives for all other classes, I'd say this is actually the best use for this weapon I've ever seen.
---
Yah, but I am not sure how you do that.
---
SHADOWLANDS FOR PREPURCHASE NOW
---
Idk man I've been feeling lotus since about week 4, it's always been a spawn window on my server
---
I have a little under 300 lotus picked , stopped for phase 2 though.
---
Ololol
---
All my "pve is for pussies" friends quit because they don't like getting camped by raids of people who roam around every nook and cranny, so here I am stuck on a pvp server. 
---
Pvp server has been fine, except for the joke that has been the last few weeks. 
---
Maybe when BGs come out I can enjoy open world pvp again.. Atm it's got nothing to do with "ThE oThEr HaLf oF tHe GaMe". It's just groups of 5+ roaming around slaughtering anyone they can our number.  If you think that's half the game, then you're not playing much of the game
---
On Grobbulus (RP-PvP) we have like 3 newspapers pumping out content. On Moonguard (retail RP-PvE) things like the Gnews have been going forever where they do live news broadcasts in character every night with multiple segments.
---
This is the kind of stuff people on non-rp servers miss out on. At one point my criminal/espionage guild had a corrupt reporter in the news that would help us manipulate and write in character hit pieces on other people to defame them. We would make gold on this kind of service.
---
I get that, your situation sucks, but the offer stands if you ever get the urge.
---
&gt; So they were cautious in dedicating resources in the beginning.
---
Yah, it's not the beginning anymore.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bkTxRPdr1M

This is completely unrelated to anything
---
That's true, but that's not the main issue
---
“They’re just ants, who cares if I spend 2 hours frying them with a magnifying glass”
---
I'd imagine you'd be able to open the addon's LUA file(s) and basically just CTRL+F for the korean text and replace it with english. You'd need to have the korean language on your computer though for it to display in the text editor I think.
---
Lmao what the fuck
---
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsWZXiBVUAEA17t.jpg
---
Except when it comes to people who pvp and play as much as you. Thanks for conceding the argument, btw.
---
That is not a feasible solution. People joined their server expecting to stay there and new whats up for the popular PvP servers. Your basically telling early adopters of classic, You like your server name, the pvp, and the people there? Well fuck you its PvE now, go join fucking Assblaster server for PvP.
---
And the sad part about all of this, is simply most of y'all aren't good enough to take full utilization of the racials.
---
I use this build at 60 for Pvp/Dungeon tanking/dps

---
No he’s just infamous for being a douche. Big difference from legendary. Also, found Susannaa’s reddit account lmao
---
There are barely any 50:50 server since the majority of players will obviously prefer to play the easy mode faction. Even on a 40:60 server it's pretty much impossible to consistently hold high value areas like blackrock since the stronger faction will have 50% more players available which is a massive difference. On top of that the horde has the massive advantage that they aren't forced to engage in pvp just to travel. It's just not feasible to always look for raid every time you wanna switch continents. which means you'll usually die 5 times or more just trying to take the boat to Kalimdor.
---
Hope they let the hord there and only allow Ally transfer, so hord is forced to reroll..sweet mountains of salt.
---
Exactly though I think you were being sarcastic. But your right it did balance out and it will continue to.
---
It's called "context." Blizzard "intervening" in the issue being discussed here would = them banning bots. Your comment was against Blizzard intervening. That's not "putting words into peoples mouths" that's discussing the topic at hand. Try to keep up and not act so self righteously about it.
---
Sometimes it's easy to forget since every human says "for the alliance" lmao
---
They’re totally in the wrong, hopefully you screenshotted. Send in Pagle discord.
---
They literally lied to you just so you could heal for them.
---
Do you think that, if we had the original player cap and regular Classic populations, this whole fiasco wouldn't have happened?
---
If it were a server with 6 Horde players and 4 Alliance players, I think the honorless ganking would still have happened *unless* those Horde players had more empathy for the others.
---
I also find interesting that in most other games, Always On PvP servers are avoided like a plague because it's only fun for the winning parties. The only other type of mmorpg server that's more hated are the Hardcore Perma-death PvP servers. But in WoW, you aren't experiencing "true Classic" or the whole game without joining a PvP Server (according to the bigger faction, of course).
---
U just triggered me bro
---
From what people have been saying - Rank 14 requires 200 players who are eligible for honor every week on the same faction.  So if there is zero of the opposite faction you can still attain rank 14 via battlegrounds.
---
Ok then if you should do that for the honor because you are a min/maxing pvp god, don’t be surprised when the enemy faction leaves the server. That is already happening and I’m certain the behaviors I mentioned were part of it.
---
Yeah. Cloud keepers leggings dropped for us last night in MC* showed it's work 1500 gold lol. Some newcomer won it too and you could feel the salt amongst the raid team lol. But rules are rules.  I also got my first piece of raid gear last night and just want to share with you lol don't k wo why.
---
&gt; The honor system is stupid. One of the only things I wished they changed.
---
Most of it could have been left intact and fixed easily. Visibly mark players on the targeting panel when they're worth no honour due to low level or diminishing returns and make them a dishonourable kill. There you go, PvP still happens, ganking still happens, but your rank is going to get fucked 6 ways from Sunday if you do it excessively, constantly.
---
Spam flash light in raids. No time for a longer heal since palas and other priests will heal faster. Raid healing kinda sucks compared with bigger healthpools like in wotlk
---
Result of everyone transferring off? You are starting at the wrong end for your conclusion. What do you think is the reason for everyone transferring off then?
---
When you grief, camp everything in every zone, every fp, every quest. And now even a capital "safe" city its toxic shitty behaviour. There's just an abundance of shitty toxic people playing on a map that is too small for it.
---
Alliance aren't birds that never experienced predators. Its already sorting itself out. Everyone's afraid of losing players but that's normal for a game this old and this hard.
---
I got a few black lotuses, dreamfoil stacks, mountain silverage stacks and plaguebloom stacks. They're quite expensive atm.  
---
But, black lotuses has been going from 120g to 90g the last days. Since AV is coming out, I know there'll be some few herbs that can be picked up.. what herbs are those?  
---
And what are your guys thought on selling now, or stacking herbs up? I've always believed in stacking up alot of items when new raids come out, but since everyone thinks so damn alike and have begun to think smarter, there's always like 1000 people saving items then trying to sell "high" when new things come up.. and for an example, all the herbs will be lower in price instead of being higher due to the stacking people is doing. Any thoughts on this? will herbs really go up in price when new phases come out, or should I just sell them right now?  
---
If it helps, I'm on Gehennas, EU, horde. Thanks!
---
It's not really the fault of the devs, or the players. Everyone remembered PVP being good, and it never was. Now that WOW players have played other MMORPGs, they're realizing that the only skill involved in world PVP is how many people you can get to move together in one group.
---
I played on Dethecus too who were you if you don't mind me asking? I played a Human Rogue named Madstealth for the entirety of my time there. Haven't ran into anyone from Dethecus at all yet glad to find someone!
---
Some of you are so incredibly dramatic.
---
Exactly. Don't make adjustments like retail with server transfers and server merges.
---
Stalagg won’t be effected, our alliance our outnumbered heavily but they’re not scared or bad. They coordinate and fight back
---
No, they don't control "a good number", they control a couple, mostly PvE. The same sites you're using to say Alliance control these realms also say Horde are about 60% of the global playerbase, destroying your own claim.
---
Well I didn’t think about it that way. Thanks for the response. And I didn’t mean to be condescending I just litterally didn’t know why.
---
As someone who never played WoW before Classic came out I think you are spot on.
---
I would never in a million years have picked up retail WoW I was already knee deep in FFXIV and didn't "need" another MMO. Then Classic happened and I fell in love. 
---
Like it was so good I cancelled my FFXIV sub. 
---
Now I still wasn't interested in retail at all because it felt like a whole different game but then Blizzcon happened and the level squish, and being able to level 1-50 on any expansion is very attractive to me. Like, at that point Retail becomes more of an upgrade to Classic at least in the eyes of a filthy casual like me. 
---
Its still a gamble for Blizzard I could still end up not liking retail. The only way I see WoW Classic+ happening is if Shadowlands doesn't see a bump from the Classic crowd. At that point Blizzard could consider the option. 
---
You're right tho TBC is free money and it makes more sense for Blizzard to try to make Retail more like Classic instead of competing with itself by making Classic+
---
That Gnome head turn made me ugly laugh
---
Yep, I was always fascinated by the Corrupted Blood glitch in vanilla and this seems like the next best thing. It's something players did that actually impacted the world.
---
Even though I'm Alliance and I was hoping this would work out in my favor rathwr than against me... it's still cool to see. You have to wonder how Horde will cope a few months from now.
---
Spriest was rolling need for off spec. Not cool unless they asked or discussed with the group before hand. This is a good testimony to running with guild groups. Unfortunately not always possible. Sorry this happened to you
---
And in the same event, if you called in sick for work there would still be a traffic jam regardless of if YOU as an individual were driving that day.  Hence, asking A player to not be an obnoxious douchebag doesn't change anything other than him falling that much farther behind the other obnoxious douchebags.
---
I played on Feenix's ED pvp for 2 years (2013-2015), and I can safely say that pretty much every single Classic server is significantly more populated, with a higher population baseline and average, as well as bigger swings around your region's peak times. 
---
So, that means a lot more players doing dungeon content, but also a lot more ganking and unwanted, unbalanced world pvp (on PvP servers). 
---
This makes it essential to choose a server with a good population balance (mainly if going for a PvP server), and it's probably also a good idea to play in groups for most of your leveling (and endgame). 
---
If you prefer a mostly solo on/off leveling style, I would *highly* suggest sticking to a PvE server, or at least testing the waters until after BGs have settled in.
---
That god awful motion blur from UE, though.
---
Yeah
---
MS &gt; OS is typically etiquette, but no solid loot rules were established from the beginning so they didn't break any ToS.
---
Rolling for stuff for other roles that you join as is crap behavior at 60, especially if you've not mentioned that you are after a certain item before the run starts. If it's been stated when the group formed, at least you can opt out and get another group.
---
Coincidentally, a tanking druid tried pulling this exact same trick on my shammy when I was healing the dungeon. Apparently some people think that rolling that feral/resto spec gives you the right to roll on gear from 2 roles since "it's your mainspec", without mentioning anything before the run or at any point during. Luckily he did not win, and the whole group condemned him for his rolling on it. 
---
People like that belong on the blacklist.
---
&gt;Except when it comes to people who pvp and play as much as you.
---
If they are a serious PvPer they will be just as geared as me.
---
I appreciate the sentiment, and I agree classic looks *excellent* for its age, but I don't think this is a great screenshot to demonstrate that.
---
I think it's pretty safe to assume we're discussing simple player count with all else being equal - same proportional class representation on both sides.
---
Sulfuras PVP had a higher pop of H to A yet everywhere in the world I go alliance is smashing us into oblivion.  Tried to finish in dreams for 3 days before finishing it because they corpse camped hard.  Hell I even took res sickness and as soon as i spawned at the bulwark I was instantly charged by a warrior.  I've never been so angry at a game that isnt dark souls in my life.
---
&gt;  I think the game can be saved.
---
That is our disconnect. I think the game is fine and it's just the natural course of the game. It's not for everyone and people will quit. The game is fine and the act of "saving" it will do much more harm than good.
---
the one with the sword isnt an orc...
---
This sub does that to tbh.
---
I still think it's Horde's fault but that's a really cool story nonetheless. Thanks.
---
Yeah. Instead of the group condemning the priest, they all made fun of me for being annoyed about it and "bABY RAGinG" (which is apparently me saying 'you're shadow, what the fuck' in the chat). 
---
Sucks that I'm going to have to run this another 20 times to see those robes drop again I'm sure -\_-
---
Maybe but still significantly fewer than those that rolled horde for facials.
---
They dont really need alliance on their server after cross realm bg's come out tuesday.
---
I kill every opposing faction member I see and I don’t feel bad about it and never will. If all the opposing faction leave my server i’ll view it as a victory.
---
Maybe if you horde cock smokers left the safety of your 15 man groups you'd actually enter a battle where skill matters.
---
You're such an effing moron
---
About 8-10 levels or so, I would say fiery isn’t awful as its 40ish a proc and only 12g on my server so grab that if you have the gold for it.
---
I couldn't get to 60 in time for phase 2 and now I just don't even want to play anymore. The amount of level 60s running around ganking on Skeram is unreal. I got my toon to level 50 and the game is pretty much unplayable.
---
I've been raiding since second week of MC release. I've only brought mana potions twice, and I'm a healer. I've always performed in top 3 through all the bosses, and never had an issue with my performance. It depends how competitive you are. If you wanna rock the top of damage meters, consumables are probably the way to go. If you wanna perform decent, I doubt you'll need consumables.
---
Are you this dramatic with everything?
---
&gt; Alliance bailed from 50:50 servers because they couldn't handle PVP. The data backs it up.
---
Oh really? Provide the data then.
---
The extreme #nochanges people would’ve complained about that.
---
It really is the system though. If a few people do something, they're bad people. If many people do something, there is a bad system.
---
Without going too deep, it's a combination of release timings and no changes but bigger servers and other things, but this is 100% systematic unless you think pvp in any capacity is morally wrong.
---
A mob called "The Cleaner" spawns and he's really scary looking. One shots you pretty much.
---
“Wtf this realm is so dead now everyone’s leaving...”
---
**returns to camping alliance flight paths with a 40-man raid for 12 hours**
---
🤷🏼‍♂️
---
What is a good add on to keep notes on anybody or everybody?  
---
 Uses I would like. Target char. Right click and shows a notes option. This is where I can put say. He gave me * on this date or this guy corpse camped me on this date. 
---
 Is there something out there like that?
---
The twink gear for 29 warriors is dirt cheap because 29 warriors are completely helpless. The fact that level 30 is when warriors get their hallmark abilities is everything that's wrong with twinking at level 29. Hunters, mages, and warlocks will make light work of you every single time. Your complete lack of defensive and self heals will make you dinner for rogues. If you want to twink a warrior I would aim for 49 because that's when warrior twinks become forces to be reckoned with. At 29 you'll be free HKs.
---
&gt; only solution is WoW Classic+ or continuing to an expansion that did slightly better
---
the things youre describing  (resurection mechanics and two factions) have never changed in any expansion
---
Thanks buddy!
---
You essentially tried to reserve loot without expressly doing so. If it's open rolls anyone who can use it should roll. If you want to guarantee loot you need to reserve it and master loot.
---
Nah. You disable that feature until one side reaches an acceptable amount of players (~500, maybe). Privates did something along thkse lines. Worked beautifully.
---
I was there yesterday too on Stalagg, did you not see the many times the ally’s wiped the horde from the city. The ally guilds are too coordinated to leave. They’re literally out farming the horde in honor. I have to admit the presence of so many people in IF ruins the rest of wpvp. These ally’s never have to leave IF to rank up
---
So wait, what exactly is the smaller faction doing wrong in the 65/35 and worse servers?
---
No one is going to transfer there to even the odds. There simply aren't enough alliance players to make the servers balanced. The only viable option to improve things in the long run IS to jump ship - if the dominated servers become 90/10 and worse, it makes PvP totally unviable on those servers. The player that bandwagon and join the massive imbalance servers can't progress past rank 8, and can't do AQ. 
---
This sort of thing incentivizes improving the game from the bottom up and the top down - players can now see that their actions are having a real, detrimental effect on their experience, and if they want to have fun they need to do so in a sustainable way. Blizzard shits bricks when it sees ALL those potential subs going away, and will take action to fix things. Its basically the best possible action players can take at the current juncture. Organizing faction wide transfers is the best possible thing that players on the lower population faction for the long term health of the game. It's their best way to fight back against impossible odds, and the best way to force change.
---
How dramatic are these people? They’re worse than any 18 year old kid camping a flight path could possible be
---
Or come to Blaumeux, ill hook ya up. need some more alliance there to crush the horde!
---
You did a good job and it looks neat. Im just happy wow doesnt look like that
---
So you just want thousands upon thousands of players to just come to a collective agreement that they should be nice to each other for a couple of weeks? Next stop, let's end all war in the world by just all agreeing that war is bad. Jesus christ.
---
Sure? Someone told me they changed Pally into Shamx and vice versa?
---
Don’t think you can get here because we are full but whitemane seems to have one of the best ratios and also one of the highest total populations.

Goteeerm!

This looks like those f2p MMOs of the earlier 2010s in an honestly very bad way. The environment detail is nice but it looks so generic and bland now.
---
I meant bracers.
---
The neutral Ah are in contested zones, those alliance alts will just die to Horde griefers, ironically.
---
&gt;kiddos gotta have their racials
---
I assure you the vast majority isn't a min/maxer who gives a shit about racials. Most people just think Horde looks cooler.
---
They could have made changes to keep the population balance in check which would have minimized what is happening right now.
---
YOU DONT MENTION THAT MYTH HERE OK?!
---
Because the ally guilds are still farming us for honor in roaming deathballs. That’s what cause flamelash to die out, the more committed players all transferred out by the guildfull
---
Changing AQ release for a dead server doesn't make them any money like fucking up the initial server launch that is the fundamental problem to all these wpvp woes has saved them money.
---
Blizzard only feels like changing #nochanges when it will save them a significant amount of money.
---
Ya being outnumbered by double isnt so bad lol
---
I'm not sure why you think it'd be an issue for horde to stay there? They basically just reached end game of where every server will eventually reach. They don't have to worry about world bosses being contested, so those will be free as fuck. All world resources are free. Come tbc leveling will be incredibly easy for them, and they'll also be able to get the bosses for free. Arena is cross realm so again it doesn't matter if ally are there or not.        
---
Like it's legitimately the perfect scenario for them because we're going to have cross realm BG's.        
---
Of course for any ally that are still on the server are fucked, and will have to give blizzard their 25$ as they decided to screw their server and any time they invested into the trash.
---
don't shield warriors!
---
It's as elusive as my Nightslayer Belt :(
---
Maybe they're both Scouts
---
You ever try to go back and play? The units move sooo slow heh. Online play with direct dial up was buggy but it was still a great game for its time. When 2 came out it was one of the first all nighters I pulled gaming, taking turns with my best friend on maps.
---
My first RTS was Dune II: The Battle for Arrakis. It started my long love of RTS. I miss Westwood and  C&amp;C.
---
Right? It's like the morons don't even realize they killed the game for themselves to. Idiots.
---
11 days played is nothing in the grand scheme of things. This is a shining example of the sunken cost fallacy. You're saying that you aren't even sticking with the game anymore and that you would rather quit when you could stop wasting time on that character and start investing it into a new one. I sucked it up and dropped my level 60 with 20+ days played and I've now accumulated 13 days played on a PvE server and I'm having an absolute blast.
---
Sl/sl warlock. You play tbc in vanilla.
---
hm. i haven’t played lock on alliance
---
I actually didn't add motion blur at all. It might be just bad video quality. Especially if you're talking about first 6 sec - I've played around compress quality cuz that cinematic was so huge (1 min - 20gb)
---
Oh wow another flamelash post, love the diversity on this subreddit
---
Yeah, but I thought it would be common sense? Kind of like if I went in as a healer and rolled on Cape of the Black Baron because I guess technically I could use it for when I occasionally DPS, but my main spec is healing/resto, so anyone who actually could use it as their main spec would not be happy if I did. I just think it's kind of bullshit that a 60 shadow priest, so not even leveling as shadow, decided 'hey I don't want to be a healer but sure I'll take any healing gear that comes up.'
---
No, I just tested it. You get the message anyway if the duration is low.
---
epl wpl and dire maul belong to the alliance
---
WotLK was where the population plateaued. It has TBC to blame for its success.
---
For me it's the bugs. Traps not working as intended, still, and pet pathing issues.
---
More times than naught I'm just annoyed to play him in PVP settings. He is insane in group Pvp though.
---
wtf are those keybinds
---
also lol
---
I can't level past 49 I just get killed by rouge's 24/7. Games unplayable atm. Probably will unsub. It was fun while it lasted.
---
If you find one he’s the only one left and he’ll do it for a 150g tip
---
This exactly. I have voiced this opinion several times on this sub. I hate osrs. They gave the game such a small dev team and gave the players too much power. It looks like a cheap private server knockoff. The content doesnt look inspired at all. 
---
Imo, if blizzard wants to go this route of classic+, it would take a serious investment in resources from them. If they didnt invest a ton of resources the quality or classic+ would be nowhere close to what we are used to in classic or even later wow expansions. I dont trust that they would be willing to put this amount of effort in. 
---
I want tbc, because I never played wow before classic so I want to experience what all my friends say was the peak of the game, but that's just me. 
---
Ideally, I think they should reintroduce content as it was done originally but omit certain features that many feel ruined the classic feel to the game.
---
Now this is shitposting!
---
Fair point, I'm in the same boat where the system is the issue but what can you do? It's 15 years old at this point, anybody blaming Blizzard needs to rethink what the issue is.
---
Problem is that it's a 15 year old game that wasn't balanced at the time but not many had any idea. Now it's 15 years later and people have all the information, hence why it's so fucked.
---
Hmm, 4% seems high to me when comparing the weapons. I hope to have a db soon anyways but I'll also be farming av rep sooo I guess I'll be picking one up until a db finally drops
---
No changes? Are you mentally challenged? This game is filled with changes.
---
"nO cHaNgEs HuRr DuRr"
---
They had 15 years to know what jerks we are; you'd think they'd have found a solution!
---
/#maybeonechange
---
I’ll ask you the same question: are you interested to discuss the subject and challenge your view?
---
Meanwhile on Whitemane I see H and A killsquads that avoid each other like the plague to kill lowbies or small groups. The only time I see legit army clashing shit is when an alliance guild and horde guild have the same raid night.
---
The beauty of a PvE server is that you can flag yourself, go get corpse camped for as long as you want and then go on to enjoy the rest of the game.
---
So? Level up and grief the enemy. You should learn to use frustration to harden your resolve.
---
Kind of dickish, but based on what you said, it didnt sound like it was very clear on both sides what was going to happen, so it's hard to blatantly say hes wrong. It's always a good idea to be more clear and upfront on things like this, you may have thought it was clear but it may not have been.
---
I don't know what I'm reading but I approve.
---
Paladins's blessing are extremely powerful and they are absolute BEASTS in pvp, shaman aren't as good. It was the only thing where alliance definitely had an advantage on horde.
---
Bringing paladin to the horde, which already had a huge natural advantage in pvp thanks to broken racials, and making them blood elves (which are much better than every alliance's racials) made the difference even more staggering.
---
Horde side, I have not ran into much RP, only when during the leveling, feels like a normal PVP server. not sure about alliance side though, I heard there is some RP alliance side though from a friend.
---
Yeah I think in the US servers theres 2 pvp realms that are ally, Whitemane and Heartseeker
---
And whitemane is still something like 55/45 and not 60/40 like every horde pvp realm
---
As a Horde player, please stop, you give us all a bad name.
---
More juvenile? All I see is Alliance crying non-stop over a video game.
---
Horde has consistently been seen as the cooler / not a generic good guy faction which is why it's more popular. This has been the case since Warcraft III. The vast majority of players are casuals so there's no chance racial spells are the reason. That's just for the top 5% of min/maxers.
---
i played during vanilla and i was mostly in favour of nochanges because i didnt wan blizz to fuck it up. but then when i got to 60 and realised i could 5man ubrs in greens and oneshot ragnaros (who my vanilla guild never even got up to) i realised classic is not nearly as hard as i remember it, i was just bad. and i wish they'd upped the stats of all the raid and dungeon mobs so instances were actually as hard as they used to feel. Like what the private servers did.
---
classic right now is so easy it feels like im playing a game for toddlers.
---
Looks good man! I've seen some videos of people redoing stormwind and orgrimmar in unreal (I think unreal is what most people use) and it just makes me think they should have stopped the current wow timeline years ago and worked on a supposed WoW 2 or something. Maybe thatlle happen in another 15 years or so hahah
---
Transfer after you get the gear
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Plays on a US server, is in a German guild and plays on a German client. Wut
---
You're actually this dense
---
One sold on Skeram for 1200 when I was offline. I've been farming thousands of lv 61-62 elites trying to find one like a madman. Just wanna equip my red lightsaber
---
Imagine how terrible that would be.
---
Players play the game as everyone else. Its’s the players fault not Blizzard for doing next to nothing to alleviate server imbalances. The amount of animosity not being directed at Blizzard but at players behavior on servers is getting ridiculous.
---
Legion had it half-right by not having templates active in world pvp. The problem was that world pvp was pointless and extremely niche. You could even get the world pvp mount without killing a single player. If this was extended to random bgs then I think that would be a good middle ground.   
---
I feel like arena doesn't hold much appeal to casual PVPers anyway, so just treat that as the competitive format with a strict rule-set and let battlegrounds be anything goes.
---
Lmao that fucking guy in top comments "IDK 60/40 really isn't that bad, it's hardly any kind of gap"
---
It's literally 50% more players you fucking walnut
---
Don't expect common sense dude. I'm sorry it happened and it sucks, but if you don't want people rolling on the pieces you want, you need to be completely clear and if they don't agree **don't run with them.**
---
It's a game, dude.
---
It's funny that you think they didn't know that.
---
It's funny because you think the server would ever normalize in balance.
---
You need to ask why a few more times. Why did horde camp every fp? because they had the population advantage. Why do they have the population advantage? because more people roll horde on PvP servers. Why do more people roll horde on PvP servers?  Racials (maybe?) - so if #nochanges is a thing, the only real think blizzard can is aim to manage the balance through other means - queuing, etc
---
if anything not having transmogshit adds to the value. no other way to get super cool looking firesword.
---
You still have to be facing them.
---
Literally just respawn behind and restealth.
---
It's called smug people being arrogant trolls and creating reasons to treat people like shit and feel superior about it.
---
Esarus simply said they don't blizzard wasn't spending much money on classic wow.
---
I dovetailed from there and stated that it's good they're not spending much money (because it's less money that they can use 
---
If you (or /u/intelligent) read more into it than that, then that's the result of you reading what you wanted to read, not what was actually being said.
---

Distracting Dagger.
---
Eh, that's the game though. I've been killed by guys I stand no chance against too, but If I wanted a carebear server I've got that option. I've even got friends on one I play with now and then.
---
Personally I just don't stress about it. Life's to short to worry about what jerks do.
---
??, i dont need to face the enemy to cast corruption on them
---
If you roll MS and someone else rolls OS then they're a dick. However, if yhe grp turned on you then I assume you handled the situation poorly.
---
agreed.  its not hard to ignore players that are under your lvl.  Even yellow/1-2 lvls under is still stacked against those players due to how the hit table works.
---
You're thinking of it from your perspective. A lot of the classic wow communities don't care about off-spec verse main spec. He probably sees it like he will use it and probably never see you again so how does your gear progression affect him. I'm not saying it's right he probably shouldn't have rolled but so few people on servers actually care about this Behavior there is no policing it. I play on one of the larger servers and the most populous Guild has the worst reputation they have Ninja looters and are just toxic in general. But it doesn't matter how they treat other people because they filled 4 weekly raids and you'd have trouble finding groups completely avoiding them. If I want career as a Healer I just don't invite anyone off-spec who can heal. It sucks but the community just isn't the same as vanilla.
---
Yeah Nagrand was my favorite zone in BC just because it was so gorgeous.
---
While that might be true for some this argument really doesn’t hold up when you consider that Alliance had more players in vanilla, but horde has by far more players in classic. Hell the reason they introduced blood elves was precisely because many players disliked the way horde looked so much they didn’t want to play horde, so Blizzard introduced a better looking horde race.
---
I think he means his username
---
I read that so many times and still think I'm off
---
Don’t even pull this shit. If healing gear drops it goes to the healer, unless they already have it, then the shadow priest can have it. No amount of stupid justification after the fact will change that.
---
Cataclysm was when wow 2 started. New engine, lots of changes on the back end and all that.
---
Its awful tbh.
---
Can't fear/charm undeads , because will of the forsaken (which also have a funny 5 sec immunty from fear/charm after its popped, just incase they miss-cast it you know).
---
Can't fear/charm Orcs, because they have that fucking 25% resist chance (which feels like 100%) and even if you get it off, they probably have the PvP trinket ready (at least some classes, who dispells fear/charm).
---
Then you have shamans who has that their tremor totem, which also dispells fear/charm
---
and warriors are also more or less immune to fear/charm.
---
So Succubus is just not as strong on Alliance as it is on the horde, since you can't really use it that well anyways in most situations. And already mentioned that the void shield often just gets purged off immediately.
---
So I use the dog most of the time, since its pretty handy in most situations, and it lets me beat down mages.
---
But at least perception (as a human) is nice, since it at least give me the advantage vs rogues in some situations where I am expecting them, and can get the opener. I like to pop it as I am about to drink/eat and bait them out that way.
---
depends on how many crazy rogues are on your server. if you sell below 5k you're getting robbed.
---
&gt; the intention was for it to be better.
---
To be fair, intention only matters so much. A lot of things they intended to be good weren't, a lot of things they added were good at the time but created issues down the line, and sometimes there's just unforeseen side effects.
---
Except that it will be literally impossible to open the AQ40 doors
---
This all could've been avoided if you personally asked the priest if he or she was planning on rolling on the robes. All you said was that you mentioned how you were "hoping" for it and then proceeded to get angry and annoyed when it didn't go your way and shocked that they would "lOL babY RAGE" and block you.
---
I just hope the horde on grobbulus curb stomp this tour at every stop.
---
I love how you make a post to backhandedly roast alliance players but in reality there are tons of horde complaining. The difference is there is 1 bad realm for horde and 35 for alliance.
---
Did you mis-speak?  Literally nothing about this makes me a vagina.
---
Blizzard, as well as any other notorious Company, usually profit of all of these getting cuts n shit. So it's no surprise why they run so rampant or why the waves aren't say weekly. If I could, I would love to provide pinpoint evidence, but just as the "bending to China and Human Rights Violations", it wouldn't matter. It makes sense in accordance with their Greed, so there is no point in bringing any RMT/Botting etc up ever again.
---
what he is saying is "I earned my billion of dollars and I get to pay less taxes.  I also get to rape the environment to make said billion dollars because I can due to the system".
---
Rattlegore is good.
---
Only by body count, which is to be expected. It's impossible to win by 251, when there are only 500 combined players in an even fight, whereas it is possible in a 500 v 500 battle.
---
It occurs to me that this is really a pretty moot point anyway, as the total number of Horde vs Alliance on a server is typically inconsequential (again, ignoring the extremes), unless all of one side shows up to fight, which doesn't happen. The biggest problem I see is a concentrated force from a guild or two showing up in the opposing faction's capital city and wreaking havoc, because the defenders are either unprepared or unwilling to combat it. They have the numbers, it's the area with their greatest concentration of players in their faction. It's the best odds they could hope for. I just don't see much interest in being "at the ready" to deal with it. Having the same number of players on the server from each faction won't fix that.
---
The limited exposure I've had to it leads me to believe that it's typically a case of a half-hearted response to the invasion, resulting in getting stomped and running to the forums to complain about faction ratios, like that's the problem.
---
I play horde not for any racials, but to play as a “beast” or “monster”. I don’t like how the alliance races look currently, and really I most prefer a blood elf. Read this knowing I’m 27m
---
Don’t worry the try hard horde on my server already have an alliance guild setup to open the aq gates
---
Hi there karma bait.
---
Pretty funny. The monkey boy one is still the best.
---
Undead are cool.
---
Sincerely, an Alliance player.
---
&gt;If blizz "doesn't care about Classic", why are they doing all this? Seriously.
---
they want us to play retail? it's more profitable than classic? duh
---
&gt;This has nothing to do with reserving loot
---
He is in a run where he wants no competition for an item. That is reserving loot. I'm not saying he has to reserve it but it's the only way to guarantee you get it.
---
&gt;outrageously
---
I think you're looking for naively. Outrageous the think that people will roll based on spec but it's not a likely outcome with classic players.
---
I have one if you want to buy it off me?
---
Duo queue as druid fc and hunter defender usually means free win vs pugs. Just tell your team to go have fun in mid
---
? Yes it'll be possible, wasn't there a fixed % that happens either way, if not they'd add one in.
---
&gt;I want tbc
---
And thats the difference between having osrs and RS3, right there.
---
So be careful what you are asking for.
---
please dont fuck my game up again. i no longer blame them for retail cause clearly they were trying to appeal to you guys but now you can go play that. stop trying to fuck my game up again.
---
“No changes” is a dumb concept, you people assume that the game was perfect. Just look at OSRS, it’s the same exact reason Classic wow came out, people thought the direction they took the game in was something they didn’t want to play. Having no changes means ignoring the problems they caused in the first place
---
&gt; The average/casual player of any game loves dumbed down content.
---
And yet a popular topic about WoW Classic is min-maxing and (for video games in general) elaborate solutions to simple problems. I think "dumbed down content" is very subjective. I would say most modern media aren't really as dumbed down as some people would insist.
---
What is best? I am debating between Mage and Warlock or Warrior vs Rogue.
---
Immersion. It's not just world quests, it's everything you interact with in the world every day.
---
I've seen private server players do it as well, I never understood why.
---
I know this is a fake image when an orc is using a mace
---
Well, the main reason I like deep prot alot is because I can still man tactical mastery with only 7 points into arms, as charge and demo shout covers it for me. However, the utility of revenge stuns and silences on shield bashes is amazing.
---
Someone screws the line of sight pull? Silence the caster and walk him back.
---
4 caster pull? 3 second stuns on rotation helps with your mitigation because we can block, parry or dodge spells.
---
Play style isn't nearly as important as team work.
---
Rock that arms spec brochacho, and I'll be your MT in raids :-P
---
Make sure to thank the others too, I couldn't have done it all myself
---
&gt; makes it easier to see cooldowns
---
Those damned Gnomes!
---
They open on their own if you wait long enough.
---
DR doesn't apply in battlegrounds.
---
And the way to combat this, is to just run out of range of the spirit healer. They will cap pretty quickly once everyone stops ressing.
---
join a few discords for 40-60 serversq because I don't think you actually play on one, I play on 3, on both factions, and it's all fairly balanced even if it's 40-60, which according to alliance is supposed to be a monumental differencec.
---
Like [this](https://i.redd.it/4wznykh8wh041.jpg) ?
---
it's a fucking social game. Get 40 people together and clean them up. Easy. 
---
But again I repeat: Alliance won't leave their cozy cities for the greater benefit. It's cause they are narcisstic fucks, that can't bother helping fellow faction members. 
---
Change my view, I'll wait.
---
...and now their watch begins  o7
---
This guy is an idiot. You don't need to let it drop off.
---
OP, you probably have a proc or something that gives you extra spell damage? Or you have amplify curse macrod?
---
I'll try trolling, that's a good trick!
---
That’s what I’m saying though. Your example is only 1/4 of most servers’ population and still requires hundreds, not dozens, of players to decide to go to the minority faction.
---
Just block all those morons, warn people about them in lfg once or twice and move on.
---
How you gonna have 5 toons named goof that travel in a ball, and not name your themed guild goofball.
---
You should see the shitshow that is ArcheAge: Unchained, this is peanuts compared to it.
---
I don't know why this terrible argument keeps getting repeated.  You are right that culture has changed, 15 years ago the vocal minority of whiny bitches didn't have a podium for their frustrations.
---
Because some people have more fun in retail? BF1942 is more fun than modern battlefield  to me but it's not as much fun for most.
---
Execute is 100% better than Rend. I said that in my first post.
---
You have 28% crit in Berserker Stance and leather gear... not in gear you would actually wear in situations where Rend is worth using.
---
Leave Blizzard alone. All they did was bring my orc family a winter wonderland ;)
---
Yeah you definitely can. I play warrior but most of my abilities are macro’d to end with “start attack.” So it should reciprocate into wands. But i’m on my phone otherwise I’d copy past my macros and you can adjust for wand. But you can find a macro online easy.
---
The worst griefers aren’t doing it for honor. I got Death camped running into BRM the other day worse than normal. The same group of 30+ killed me at TP, then proceeded to hang out at the edge of my res range so they could one shot me every time I came back. They did this the whole way to BRM, loooooooong after I became an honor less target. If anything, the people who are ranking are less of an issue, because for them this would have been a complete waste of their time. Rankers tend to move around or camp a single high traffic area, getting a few honor kills but not bothering time continue chasing honorless targets. The really game-ruining behaviors are a different phenomenon.
---
&gt; Perhaps unpopular opinion here: I always wished the currency for killing people in PvP would be called something else than honor.
---
MoP had 'bloody coins' for PVP while using an item that made you killable by both factions and flagged for PVP. Sounds a bit more suitable than Honor.
---
I mean there's still plenty of PVP servers that are fun for both factions and relatively balanced...
---
You're just wrong. The duration left doesn't prevent it from being reapplied
---
Yeah, blizzard would have to implement it and they could adjust the hard numbers to get a good feel for the players
---
It's really bad though. You will be the worst DPS in the raid no matter what gear you have. I play paladin, it's BS but the truth.
---
I knew about not accepting the res but not about DR not counting. Thanks
---
He said absolutely nothing about Paladins. What are you whining about?
---
Auto-attack doesn’t even necessarily need to be in your action bar. I just leave it in one of the unused slots in my secondary action bar on my melee classes, but right-clicking on the mob will also initiate auto-attack, and it should start automatically in combat as well (when the mob is in melee range).
---
As a clothie you’ll probably never need it, because if you do you’re probably already dead, lol.
---
You won’t need alch but herb makes DM so much better. With it you can hit 30+g/h. Also got the added bonus of some good boe epics in their loot table, but ive only had crap ones so far
---
I'm not being racist, at least not in the way that matters.  I'm talking about the idiots picking a race, not being assigned one at birth.  If people are actively doing something instead of just doing with what they are dealt with, then it's not really racism is it?  It's not like they can't change or haven't actively decided to be what they are.  It's like if Nazis take over the planet and everyone joins the Nazis because they are on the winning side.
---
Yes, cause i dont give a fuck about horde. once i get my rank 13 armor i'm back 2 pve.
---
That's like saying I'm not part of the U.S. population when I'm asleep.  Current logins are not the same as population.
---
I’ll take my pocket totems over kings any day. 
---
And by any day, I mean until AQ40+ when it’s a huge stat increase compared to right now, and then i’ll whine about how Horde doesn’t get it and how unfair that is. 😤
---
Seriously... So many "this looks alright for a 15 year old game" 
---
... Yeah looks like a new game rendering 15 year old characters models, and bumpy terrain to me
---
World PvP isn't a game. No *good* game only takes place when one member is severely disadvantaged and doesn't want to participate. It's a social experiment to see who would punch a defenseless stranger in the face for $1 if there were zero repercussions.
---
Your character is defined by how you act toward your inferiors. But most people in the game would rather derive their values from some gay rhyme.
---
I play PvP because I like when MMOs gave their players harsh freedom. In a world that allows cruelty, you can see who's good and who's not. #NoChanges
---
I am pretty sure that was added in TBC, as many servers way into TBC never opened AQ40 gates.
---
If humans had every man for themselves in vanilla, i’d have picked that. &gt;_&gt;
---
Anything but TBC, that expac is honestly a complete disaster in 2019.
---
It will single handely kill classic wow in a month and a half when everyone has roflstomps tier 4, and realize the game is actually a massive downgrade from vanilla. And adds a fuckton of elements that makes it more similar to retail than actual "classic".
---
But its not like the \#nochangers were clueless about vanilla, and how it would play out in the modern era, right? Surely they must know what TBC is like, after all they played it 12 years ago and of course it will play out the same way this time around.
---
They actually did but very very slightly, this is why 1 cap layer at start was equal to 1 vanilla server cap and now roughly equals 2 vanilla server caps. Still nowhere close to the numbers he mentions.
---
&gt;Earthfury is 3.3k-3.4k concurrent online at peaks, sounds like vanilla to me. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I quote myself 
---
&gt;&gt;So we both agree concurrent online cap for classic is roughly 2x of vanilla and it's filled only on a several servers Blizzard actively encouraged players to transfer from, while concurrent online of most classic servers being similar to high/full pop vanilla servers? Because that was the conclusion of these threads.
---
&gt;Fits "online of most servers" pretty close.
---
Where are you getting your numbers from? Blizzard has already stated that medium realms are larger than any vanilla realm, and have provided no information that this has changed since layering was removed. As we already discussed the size of online population was increased as well. Are you just assuming they dropped all of this when phase 2 was implemented because there is zero evidence to back up your claim.
---
Not sure why this isn’t on any pre raid bis lists, thank you!
---
I mean both work you're just being a dick brah
---
I'd rather wear T1 chest just for the looks, that robe looks like trash on druids, but yeah your situation still sucks.
---
Can I have some context lol who is apes
---
He is the one healer in a group with one healer, one tank and 3 DPS. Common sense and any form of half decent loot etiquette dictates that he has first dibs on any healer gear. 
---
Anything else is just bullshit.
---
Shoot has to be on my action bar though, and im trying to replace it for all my heals and buffs to fit on it
---
The players are the reason the factions are imbalanced.
---
you need to get some exp it one time based. then 30 minute. 
---
so from loyal 1 to 6 3 hours total
---
I mean BGs aren't going to be much different.  You either stay in your team's zergball or you get run over by the other team's zergball.
---
&gt; I play horde not for any racials, but to play as a “beast” or “monster”.
---
&gt; and really I most prefer a blood elf.
---
LOL

&gt;The last time a server in this region had more than three layers was the first week of September, and almost all realms reached two layers shortly after that.
---
That's pretty commonly known and at the very least someone who justifies his own right to argue about population is definitely expected to know it. The fact he pulls some "facts" of 3-5 layers out of his ass just to support his own narrative is... well... sad.
---
The forums people suck, the reddit people suck, the general chat spammers suck and every discord I've been on sucks.
---
I don't thrust players decissions.
---
I do however thrust the 10-15 year old wow game designers so I rather have vanilla, tbc and wotlk with all the ups and downs.
---
Pretty much this, I was leveling a new character to play with some friends that decided to roll on Flamelash, and luckily I managed to convince them to hop over to Earthshaker in the last 10 minutes.  
---
Things REALLY went to shit those last 2 hours or so.
---
yea me too... hope they introduce some way to transfer in the future
---
Flying removed a lot of inconveniences of travelling. Who wants to spend 20 minutes running to an instance? It's a complete waste of time. If you really liked travelling by ground you could still do it, the option was there.
---
Yeah, those things don’t coincide, but I said what I said haha
---
Yes but by the time transmog came around there were enough “cool fiery sword” lookalikes that Teebu’s didn’t sell for as much.
---
Find the right guild.. Our first robe of volatile power went to a boomie
---
Fuck off with your shitpost
---
WPVP is trash tbh man. It is literally just fighting as cheaply as you're able too.
---
BGs have their faults but they're still far better.
---
Said this in another comment but it’s kinda the opposite. The most game ruining behaviors are highly inefficient. I had a group corpse camp me from TP to BRS. They quit getting honor from me after maybe 10 minutes, but continued for another 30. If they stayed in one spot, killed me a few times, but didn’t follow me and stayed in one area, they would have gotten more honor by getting a few kills on each new person passing through. In stead they tend to farm the same players long after they stop getting anything from it.
---
Kings? lol, Wait until you find out what Blessing of Freedom does.
---
Nope, I tested it without amplifying curse.  It behaves the same way regardless where you can't override it at low duration.I also don't have any trinkets, or spell power yet.
---
I think its a leftover from the legion client, and not intended.
---
- LOL
---
They have given us an estimation.
---
&gt; Each layer is effectively going to be what a healthy server was at launch in 2004 in terms of the number of people it holds.
---
Haha, that's beautiful. My guild was originally going to roll Whitemane, but then we went to Bigglesworth, and then eventually transferred over to Anathema because wait times were still too high. I just find it funny that you never see two evenly matched players going at it. It's always severely slanted in one persons favor. I was leveling with some higher level guild mates in WPL. I was specced deep prot warrior at the time and we'd have stray 60s try to kill me. I had 49% damage reduction +10% from defensive stance, so I wasn't as squishy as they would expect. I'd just turn around and hit them with concussive blows and watch their helath bar melt as my 2 friends deleted them... and then the rest of their raid party would show up and ass-blast our group.
---
That’s a lie or a bad guess
---
The problem is they are binding macros with multiple abilities into one bar, instead of having keybinds to different action bars.
---
This is def alliance
---
Ok, but if we can, we will.
---
By everywhere else i meant every other server. Allience having the majority is a massive rarity.
---
Then the horde just get 80 people and come fuck us, I've already done this when your out numbered 1:5 there's no chance. 
---
The reverse is also happening it's not horde or alliance its which ever faction owns the server
---
its sad that y’all are getting so worked up over a video game
---
Yeah this has really soured my appreciation for classics development. People wanted this. People put in the work and created a game. But the management wasnt there whatsoever and it seems they are letting their game die out of spite.  Because players said they want something 15 years ago. Because retail was not satisfying. It seems they want to prove "you thought you did but you didnt" more than they wanted to prove that classic could be successful.
---
"I want classic not on a rail! WAIT STOP DOING THAT THING I DONT LIKE THATS NOT CLASSIC SOMEONE PUT THEM BACK ON MY SELF DEFINED RAIL THATS NOT A RAIL!!!!!"
---
I can optimally gain resources by being more of a cunt in real life. Doesn't make it any less despicable.
---
I remember people suggesting that months ago around here and getting downvote bombed by \#NoChanges crowd. That plus people were infuriated at the idea of not being able to create a character they wanted too.
---
It obviously would suck, but if it's between that and having a server die, the first would be better.
---
imagine fleeing from an imbalanced server just to re experience the same shit. Alliance players should do themselves a favour and not give the horde someone to play against
---
Stalagg is worse
---
What was it like playing it multiplayer? I didn't know anyone else who played it, so I could never set that up. However I got the game around the time that other multiplayer games were becoming popular, so I tried desperately to connect it through the LAN setting, not understanding what LAN meant (I was about 7 or 8 at the time). 
---
But in retrospect, I wonder if it would have even been a good multiplayer game.
---
&gt; Because some people have more fun in retail? 
---
I think its almost entirely a different market, since the games are so different at this point. So at least people who returned exclusively for classic probably cba to play retail, altough some new players might be willing to try it out I guess.
---
Either way, my subjective opinion still stands. Retail is fucking awful.
---
Long-term they’re about equally profitable, due to subscriptions being the main source of income, though in-game items in retail like pets/mounts give retail a slight edge.
---
Classic players are a different type of player than retail too. Retail players could care less about the community, whereas to Classic players (the old school ones anyway) it’s *all* about the community.
---
You can also get the +20 fishing pole which sells for over a gold on my server.
---
Low was an estimations of players per layer though. Delayering resulted in a corresponding concurrent online cap being decreased for every server. 
---
Blizzard also stated realms were at 1-2 layers before delayering, not 3-4 even 5 like he stated: this is why this is a lie.
---
For the love of god, can someone help me find the schematic for thorium tube. Is it on a timer?
---
I've talked to every engineer supplier/trainer in Gadgetzan, Ogrimmar, and Winterspring. Nothing
---
This is false. Vanilla had a faction imbalance, but it was biased alliance across both pve and pvp servers. There were very few horde biased servers. Attracting people to horde from alliance was a good thing for faction balance at the time.
---
And then you die because a thorium grenade isnt doing shit against 5 shamans
---
To be clear, fury tanks are the best raid dps because of the mechanism. Fury dps is on par with rogue, but not better.
---
I get that you are severely entrenched in this "us vs them" mentality but how does your comment make any sense?  Alliance are leaving because they are unhappy with the pvp servers they rolled on.  I personally am in no rush for BGs to come out.  Grinding pve AV for pve gear is not exactly my cup of tea.
---
Light be with you!
---
My guild has yet to get one and have been raiding since week 4
---
more pvp complaints using imagery from retail to make the punchline
---
im sensing a theme here
---
Theres never a situation where it would be worth using but if BT is on CD and you can use a dot slot.
---
Leather gear is superior while leveling, leather/mail is better at 60.
---
Do you understand layering removal resulted in a corresponding server cap decrease?
---
Shaman Tank works, but may as well be a myth considering how few and far between tank shamans are lol.
---
Use the twitch app
---
Honestly, it wouldn't be a bad business move to try and use our natural stupidity (I.e the faction imbalance and griefing) as an excuse to force people back into retail. People spend a lot of money on the services and mounts etc. There's none of that in classic, and while a lot of people are subbed just to play that version of the game, I'd imagine they make a lot more money through the retail ingame store.
---
Sorry man. I cant blame you. It's not fun on this end either and if I could help the health of the game, transfer over, and have your back instead of being made to feel like the meta of the game is farming you (have not participated in FP camping/zerging) I would do it in a heartbeat.
---
Wait so people level to 60 and because they chose the faction specific class they get de-leveled?
---
Shit idea before that part but that part is real shitty.
---
You have yet to make one from what I can tell
---
Bringing up that racials dont compare to having a different faction locked class that is MVP in PVP. I realize that most alliance players are pretty daft but this is taking it to new levels.
---
Dude, Go outside go get some sun,Take a walk in the forest, Relax :) It's just a post about a videogame ! 
---
Breath.....
---
This was not my experience on nostalrius or warmane tbc over the past 4 or so years, though I know that's anecdotal I think the notion that it's likely here to stay is a bit unfounded.
---
I'm so glad I picked Blaumeux, it feels at least workable for the Alliance still.
---
Clearly dont understand the comment.
---
Short answer no, mele attack and ranged shooting override one another.
---
If youre a hunter add shoot to your ranged attacks, and add /startattack to your mele attacks.
---
If youre a caster theres no scenario where you need mele attacks so just keybind your wand and move along.
---
That new model killed it..
---
Really just illustrates how much gaming mentality has changed over the past 15 years
---
There are, I'm referring to the unbalanced ones that are pretty much beyond hope of returning to balance.
---
AR/Prep/mace stun rogue.......
---
Who would they be killing, the number of people out doing dungeons would be so low they wouldn't be able to compete, with no alliance out in pvp groups there would be almost noone for them to kill. It would be more advantageous for them to server transfer. Your never going to stop it completely. Horde are still overall dominant they will still be out waiting for ques. It will just be lower giving them no insentive to move servers. Therefore world bosses will always be horde dominant. Forcing dominant factions into long ques is a huge insentive to server transfer, therefore balancing out servers.
---
Heal rank 4 is your main spell.
---
Imagine believing we landed on the moon 60 years ago but have never returned since.
---
Who gets to decide which changes? The guy that wants dungeon finder? The guy who wants more black lotus spawns?
---
Leaving the pure integrity of the game is the only fair way, whether you like it or *not.*
---
Make sure you have the right version ([file tab](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/deadly-boss-mods/files))
---
Check addon list at the login screen: is it showing up? missing dependencies? enabled?
---
&gt;most servers are 3-5x the population of a full vanilla on concurrently
---
Wrong. Name me a server not listed in the Blizzard warnings to transfer out, then we'll talk using that specific example.
---
&gt;removing layering didn't remove the players just shoved all those layers into one
---
Removing layers also resulted in a corresponding server online cap decrease.
---
&gt;There is currently no server that is less populated then a "full" vanilla server 
---
Quit making my last name look bad.
---
Yet I receieved a month-long suspension for logging onto my friend's account at my house. Gotta crackdown on those filthy account sharers.
---
If you need help or something message me I’m sobe on there. I’m running my alts and guildies in stuff nonstop
---
This is the only real solution.  OP’s idea will never happen.
---
Yep, at the end of TFT it certainly felt like we had the set up for 3 or even 4 factions. Alliance, Horde, Night Elves, and Forsaken. I'm sure they streamlined those factions for the sake of reducing a workload that was already overwhelming them, but it would have made more sense to at least have a 3rd faction for the Forsaken. I could have even imagined the Blood Elves joining them (both alienated by the Alliance, yet historical enemies with the Horde, and both victims of the Scourge).
---
And so I wouldn't have to tolerate those dirty undead in my dungeon groups.  I'm on board.
---
To be fair, the “dead” servers have some issues too. Last night we tried for an hour to find dps for ZF and had to give up. On a Friday night.
---
I like Deviate Delight because it’s very close to an actual vanilla experience in population and faction balance...but the AH is shit, nothing moves at all, and sometimes you can’t run dungeons because there’s just not enough people to get a group. Maybe not as severe a problem as 90/10 faction balance but still frustrating.
---
Best for what? All those classes have unique roles.
---
if you have open gcds and rage you can sunder armor instead of rend in that gcd.
---
If you don't mind sitting and eating after every mob, sure. I prefer less downtime. Makes you move faster overall.
---
You could get upset that someone educated you as to why your statements were asinine and objectively incorrect; or you could learn. How you decide to continue speaks volumes about your character as a person. I hope you can learn to learn some day.
---
That’s why I put it between “”, I’d consider myself a label goal oriented person. I feel forced to camp certain spots for a certain amount of time, it’s much more efficient than running around trying to desperately find alliance to kill.
---
Said that, it’s not fun for me, I’m looking forward to reroll alliance on a not already dying server, Venoxis seems relative stable for the already chocking german PvP realms, lucifron is considered dead by now, alliance gave up there.
---
Do you know of ANY instant attacks or abilities that reset swing timer? (for any class, e.g. rogue)
---
&gt;	It's called smug people being arrogant trolls and creating reasons to treat people like shit and feel superior about it.
---
&gt;	Try holding a conversation without putting words in peoples mouths. I’m convinced you can’t.
---
Self-awareness isn’t your strong trait, is it?
---
Also. Try putting in "nomod" in your conditionals that don't have a mod. It can help sort out a few quirks...
---
Or set up an if notarget, then target self and cast.
---
Hey man, don't diss my one two punch. You can't handle my Stormstrike into Earth Shock.
---
Yes, this is correct.  It's definitely Leatrix Plus.
---
It's Leatrix Plus.  The people saying tiptac are wrong.
---
Wow that was simple, thank you!
---
I bit the bullet and bought it off the AH. The markup was worth avoiding the hassle.
---
Wrong.  It's Leatrix Plus.
---
They really should open PvP -&gt; PvE transfers, but not allow it to happen the other way around.
---
On my server (thunderfury) it’s pretty balance. Alliance are assholes and always group up to take you down.
---
Twitch desktop app makes things easy.  Makes sure it’s DBM Classic
---
That's optimistic.
---
Horde or alliance?
---
There's no fleeing here.  /who searing gorge 60 for both factions right this moment (27/23 in favor of the Alliance):

I'm sorry you're so salty about your situation.  You're welcome to reroll here and I'll send you a care package.
---
You don't wanted that to do that.
---
This is how it's supposed to work. Servers die they get merged. The player base will always be declining because people lose interest in vanilla wow gameplay. That's always how beeit's been. Nobody should have expected that their server would stay strong for years and years. We warned you not to play on medium or low pop servers because those would be the first to die. But you were impatient and didnt listen.
---
So they should't have been introducing transfers from servers people filled and overfilled despite all warnings NOT to do it? Lol thanks god you don't work for Blizz.
---
Not sure if top tier trolling or just braindead
---
Priest, and have shoot on my 1 but want to make it my right click and take shoot of my actuon bar
---
Tbf knowing when to use wotf and how to force a player to waste a cc etc is more skillful than simply rolling undead and having the best 1 button etc
---
I rolled on Whitemane despite disliking world pvp, and pvp in general in Wow, so I could be with my friends and seeing all these posts makes me soooo glad I stopped playing classic before Phase 2 started
---
I think a large part of WoW’s success is because they *didn’t* use graphics like this.
---
Classic WoW’s aesthetic and style is genius and has held up even 15 years later.
---
I disagree with top comment about how "anything they do now will have blacklash".
---
They need to incentivize joining and staying alliance, NOT punish or lockout horde players from making new horde characters or playing. 
---
Give us a **reason** to go alliance. make dragonslayer buff permanent for anyone who visits an alliance city for a few weeks. make 40 mount training free. figure it out. 
---
give them free shit to incentivize dealing with us horde douchebags.
---
Like 10 minutes?
---
Another solution us to just quite whining about it.
---
Imagine rolling alliance over and over again only to get your shit pushed in every time LOL
---
People are inherently selfish. When i farm brd for SGC i literally wont invite anyone else who can equip it unless i know them personally AND we have a discussion beforehand so they understand they cannot roll on it. Be group lead and do a personal conversation with each person so there is never confusion. Shit takes too long to farm for some rando to come in and snag it when they dont even need it.
---
It’s not a terrible weapon all things considered, you’re exaggerating a bit
---
They should have done this at the launch of classic, I feel like it’s too late now unless they allow faction swaps too
---
The system is the problem. Expecting players to not take advantage of it is just misguided.
---
Ok Boomer
---
As someone who had two of my closest friends at the forefront of Horde leveling on Flamelash, Venture (the alliance guild) essentially camped every higher-level Horde area a fuckton.  
---
So I am not surprised that the majority of Horde went berserk.  
---
For reference, Venture has now moved to Earthshaker and is doing basically the same thing again towards lower level players.
---
They mentioned transfers from underpopulated to other servers if you pay attention. Like "migrate or die, your servers is dead anyway".
---
Legion is literally the end of everything war.  Because of Sargares and his own twisted ideology this was the big bad of the wow universe the Thanos of azeroth. But Blizzard needs to milk the cow...
---
Yeah I think a lot of folks really didn't know what they were in for with Classic. A lot of my friends who wanted to be "hardcore" quit after three weeks because "it's so slow!"
---
Just roll horde
---
i solo farmed these as a mage. not sure if you’d be able to do it as an spriest because of the intense aoe required to kill the dog packs (that rip us clothiers apart) but  you could try and/or enlist a mage friend and do it ez
---
Which is exactly what this thread is about, PvP not PvE
---
It's a server name. That's all. Dont get too attached
---
Anyone notice how most alliance players, and a decent chunk of horde will admit it’s not blizzards fault? Then you have the meta gamers who roll in death squads talking about how this is what the game was designed for and they are not a shitbag human, get angry at blizzard guys! 
---
We know which one this guy is.
---
Week 2. No bindings, no eye, no mageblades, 1 hammer, 1 bre, and the most Hunter gear I've ever seen.
---
On my warlock, I outgear most hunters on our server with crap in my bank... 4/8, giantstalker 1/8 dragonstalker, leaf, sinew, tranq shot, and like 3-4 off pieces. Our newest Hunter walked out 5/8 in their first raid.
---
I just wish they'd use some of that subscription revenue from classic re-subs to triple the realm/server count and reduce realm population caps to vanilla levels. This would go a very long way towards fixing many of the problems. The hard part is getting a corporate entity to recognize long term health in their investment rather than emphasizing quarterly gains. Good luck to us.
---
If you want to point out things that have never ever happened, how about an entire faction on a high pop server jumping ship within 3 months of the server’s release?
---
Horde is dominant in pvp and over in retail as well.
---
Orc could participate in a blacked video tho
---
pvp servers where designed to camp low level players with raid groups, so they cant quest, creep or do dungeons?
---
Alliance are just gutless cowards, they camp every fucking choke point and farm honor, then go in the forums and cry their eyes out about BRM. 
---
Grow a pair, take those 15 man kill squads and contest BRM or shut the fuck up
---
Imagine rolling a character for racials lmao
---
yikes. I don't even care about ranking. I'm just able to see who is to blame and not deflecting blame from Blizzard for no reason.
---
This is fantastic!
---
Unless you are very low level and are using sunder Instead of heroic strike, to level faster.
---
While I don't know about Alliance side, Horde side on Earthshaker only got maybe around 100 or so players it seems. Even that might be pushing it.
---
Cuz cclassic is full of noobs who dont know how to play av/ people have been waiting years to defend til their last breath/ you cant queue in raid and ur gonna get pugs/  it only takes a few alliance to shut down the backdoor /majority of my server (faerlina) is casual not rankers
---
No worries!  Have a good one.
---
What is the best place to quest at level 30 for alliance? I just came from finishing Ashenvale/Duskwood. I went to STV and could only manage a couple of the Panther/Tiger quests from Nesingwary as a Druid. The other stuff is too hard right now. 
---
I’m going to try Arathi. Other suggestions? I seem to remember Desolace and Thousand Needles being more like mid 30’s.
---
this person also is leveling 5 paladins on Incendius.
---
&gt; AQ will be impossible 
---
What? Why? It will take them more time to open the gates but it will be eventually opened anyway.
---
Then how do you explain that those same people farming "hk's" also grief players that are grey level and worth no honor?
---
lol
---
People will just reroll as ally and balance it out you dongus, just like people rerolled tanks and now they’re much more common
---
There's lots of discussion, especially in xpoff about Classic Twinks. Pet guide suggest getting the trinity of The Rake, Boar and Wind Serpent. Basically Rake is offensive option especially good vs casters, Boar is tanky and more defensive option but also good for faster opening with charge and Serpent is your range option. You can't get all pets safely to 19 as far as I know so they are usually done with Rake staying on lvl 18 while others go up to 19 but you can switch if you really prefer your cat. Do note that you do have to tame like 1 or 2 other Pets and kill a mob or two with them to gain access to few more skills (generally Bite for all and Claw if you have The Rake, these are for the highest ranks possible at your level bracket)
---
Personally I skipped The Rake entirely since getting it as Ally would have been major pain in the ass and I'm planning on mostly using Boar anyway. I picked up the serpent as backup if I start to feel very safe on my BGs. Your Pets will need 6 bars worth of exp per level and 1 bar + time spent with them to gain loyalty level. Depending on what quest items and such you aim for you might have to plan your quest and dungeon exp gain some, more pets you have the tighter it gets.
---
You want to get your pets on levels 10 for Rake and 16-17 for Boar and Serpent, if you really wish to use something else due preference then you probably need to do some extra research.
---
I'm no specialist but I leveled pretty freeform until my first important quest (14, Defias Brotherhood as Ally) and then didn't pick up or return any quests that didn't have anything to do with the items I wanted. As Horde you might want to start running Deadmines around 10 with booster to get your items, you can do it later but you might have to play around with getting killed so you don't get too much exp.
---
You can't really quest outside of getting the items if you want to level more than one pet since they need raw kill exp as far as I know. I finished my Twink being midway into 19 with 2 pets at 19 and all quest items I wanted. Battlegrounds will provide no exp to you nor your pets.
---
Or maybe, and just hear me out because this might blow your mind, someone might like most aspects of classic except a few particular ones.
---
LFG - you are looking for a group, so it’s hard. You are literally expecting there to be an existing group who wants to do the same dungeon you are keen, and also needs a role like your class. 
---
LFM - you are looking for individuals out of all online players. So anyone who has the intention to do the dungeon can join you. 
---
Well if we have dungeon finders everything will be easier. But some people just don’t want convenience, they like time wasting and call it “social”.
---
Only for pvp. If you are alliance on pve you really have nothing to worry about right now. But virtually all horde will be unable to have satisfying pvp for a long time. Pve servers included. And you gotta remember most of the game is on pvp servers, so without those servers being healthy, the whole game will suffer after the loss of those players
---
Would recommend this! I'm horde on this server and it definitely feels like a constant battle and not ruled by one faction or the other
---
I feel like it's more beating a dead horse at the moment
---
My server will be fine lol if the servers are dead then it's actually a blizzard problem. The alliance getting wrecked by the horde is an alliance problem. If you had more players more organization etc you would not have this problem.
---
Yea I didn't word that very well let me fix that
---
Yeah they did.. the wow forums were bitch central.
---
So you're saying that alliance on herod *aren't* badasses fighting the good fight against an enemy twice their size and still giving them a run for their money despite being so outnumbered?
---
I don't know why you'd want to sell your faction short, honestly.
---
Since honor came out, I haven't been able to make it to dungeons without running into an alliance zerg utterly decimating groups of horde much larger than them, and/or roaming gank squads of well-geared, well-organized alliance PvPers.
---
Sure, they eventually get overwhelmed by horde's backup, but I doubt many of those horde players (myself included) would do half as well in those cases.
---
I also found it near-impossible to level up from 52~60 on my mage alt without getting very, very, sneaky and/or playing at 3~6am server time (the only time the sheer extent of faction imbalance is tangible for horde players, as zones like WPL/EPL/SG/etc go from 5~10 alliance marauders and 10~20 horde corpsewalkers to 0~1 alliance and 10 horde)
---
I know it sucks to be alliance on herod, but trust me when I say that your faction has a lot to be proud of and you guys are punching well above your weight class.
---
P2 has been a bloodbath for me and despite my leveling grinding to a halt, herbing/mining/fishing becoming impossible, and dungeons taking ages to get to during peak hours, the only thing I'd trade it for is perfect 50:50.
---
I'm actually kind of scared for you guys come the 10th because all your best men will be in BGs instead of contesting the open world zones as strongly as they do
---
And I'm telling you there are reasons to play Alliance on PvP servers.
---
PvE content still exists on PvP servers. It's not like everyone on PvP servers only PvP.
---
Your argument is disingenuous.
---
Thanks again for hooking me up last night. Gonna be grinding the druid this afternoon. If any levelers want a bear tank to run with, feel free to hit me up. Should be ready for RFC or WC tomorrow.
---
And this is why I - and anyone smart for that matter - stopped acknowledging anything after Wrath of the Lich King as Canon/Lore etc. The game ended, done and dusted, right then and there.
---
Smart people know that transferring to a lower pop server without any GUARANTEE paid transfers will be implemented will result in you being on a dead server with no way out. We just recently saw flamelash die.
---
It’s not like Classic is going to last forever, 90% of servers don’t even have queues anymore.  Many people are quitting daily.
---
Vanilla wow in today’s age is a toxic game. Back then nobody cared about gear as much as they do now. It’s not about community anymore, everybody wants to be someone. Multiplayer games are all about competitiveness now.
---
It's only worth what someone will pay for it.
---
For boar you want to get one from Redridge that's level 16 or 17 when you are at that level as they have rank 2 skills from the get go.
---
Those other abilities can just messy up your bar. If you already know an ability is on a key you dont need to see the icon, the cooldowns of other abilities may more important.
---
It's not impossible. You just make alliance characters and put the turn in materials on the neutral AH for 1 copper buyout
---
I can't believe how out of touch these people are who are making fun of people blaming the devs. There's not even the slightest chance the whole population is going to band together and agree to sustainably kill the other faction. The only thing that being a "nice guy" on the dominant faction gets you is a lower rank, no rewards, no gear, and a shitty rank 2 title. 
---
The devs chose to add 3-4x more players per server. The devs chose to let the non-dominant faction transfer off for free early on. The devs then chose to add a bandaid (letting dominant only transfer) which was ridiculous, because honestly how many people are going to transfer - leaving all their friends, leaving their guild - just to go to a reverse dominated server because of the massive fuckup from the original free server transfer, where instead of dominating 65-35, you're now getting dominated at 20-80. And now that the problem has been getting worse, we hear absolutely nothing, not even an acknowledgement of the issue and how they're looking into potential issues. 
---
Yeah what fucking nerve of the dominant factions blaming devs.
---
Nah 
---
You can het waaay better swords in bwl

How much herb do u need ?
---
Gehennas is pretty big, as is Firemaw; but those aren't that balanced. Gehennas is 43.7:56.3 and Firemwaw is 42.8:57.2 (A:H, according to ironforge.pro). Closest to 50:50 right now is Earthshaker at 50.4:49.6 , which is a high pop server since recently (lots of people from Flamelash transferred there, it used to be medium). The data may be a bit out of whack tho due to all the recent transfers.
---
I agree but they said after I think WOD that they had the next 7-9 expansions lined up.
---
Not to mention the lighting/shadows and grass look like they're from 2015 or something. Not complaining though, i think the game looks awesome and they modernized it very well...it's just definitely not a "15 year old game" from a graphics standpoint for 90% of people.
---
It will all be over soon little one. Dec 10th and you can all go back to carebear kitty island adventure.
---
I just run dungeons, mainly Strath live.
---
He didn’t say he wast going to roll on healer gear. There isn’t an option to select MS or OS. Is what it is.
---
I hope you understand Blizzard won't introduce it ever, so why do you even care?
---
No problem buddy, hope you enjoy it!
---
Pic got the point across. I’ll try harder for you next time
---
You actually see this for lots of classes.  Druids have to do a quest to get bear and water forms, but then cat form @ 20 they just learn at the trainer.  The original intent was to have all classes have a class quest every 10 levels or so, but they didn't make it and never went back and finished.  Everyone was supposed to eventually have an epic class quest @ 60, but they only finished 4 (hunter, priest, warlock, &amp; paladin).
---
I see the same issues as horde dominated servers on Mograine. Menethil constantly terrorized, open world is kinda unplayable, big gank raids, huge BRD crawls. It's not fun.   
---
If the experience is the same for the Horde on Mograine, it's just equally crap for both factions.   
---
And even if the ratio was perfectly 50:50, there's no avoiding that a good amount of horde rolled characters for the PVP racials, so a bigger chunk of those guys are probably in it for the PVPing anyway.  
---
And no hate to Horde here, I just don't think the faction balance is what's causing the issues, and I see them issues every day on Mograine.
---
Guild of fulltime wow players who shit in diapers and live on welfare.
---
It's definitely just a thought experiment since there are a million factors in any fight and, like you said, it's never going to be really even.
---
3 pvp realms arcanite reaper is like 71/29 split to the alliances favor
---
Hashtags are sarcasm.
---
ITT: Salty allies
---
&gt;A three faction system means (ideally) only 33% of the server is friendly to you and can party up
---
Doesnt have to mean that. There is really no reason horde and alliance shouldn't be able to party up. At this point in retail, we have worked together so many times in lore, but in game it isnt recognized. It would make a lot of sense that orcs have made friends with humans, and many taurean and night elves are already friends. Its just a stupid arbitrary limitation at this point, especially with warmode existing. Warmode = pvp, non warmode = group with either faction.
---
OK but the promise of classic was a return to old wow before all the qol changes.  If you don't like classic wow that is totally understandable but don't ruin it for the people who knew what they signed up for and still want that.
---
He plays on Incendius Alliance as well.
---
I have a character in the 50s on Grob (Alliance) and i have had a tough time leveling since phase 2 came out. Lots of ganking. I don't have a ton of time to play during the week, so I have been playing an alt on a PvE server for the past two weeks. When BGs come out I will check back in to see if things are any better.       
---
          
---
I can tell you that Grob as a server though is worth it. Community is great. However the server isn't immune to the problems with the state of PvP servers currently.
---
True, warsong being separate wpuld be really weird.
---
It sounded reasonable at first because they have their own factions but yeah, no.
---
But they're alliance, so maybe we should call it shortposting or gnoming.
---
Make em into paladins
---
It was very slow going. The regular units were slow but the big units were even slower. Not a whole lot of fun when compared to other online games available at the time. Tides improved a lot and had some great improvements on LAN play and had a few LAN parties that went between Tides and Duke Nukem or Quake Deathmatch.
---
&gt;  The more people the server holds while maintaining the server A/H ratio the less noticeable the imbalance gets.
---
The opposite is true actually. 50% more players means the stronger faction will dominate all important areas the vast majority of the time. 
---
On an empty server you can at least enter certain areas without getting camped. Due to this the weaker fraction will simply play less and generally not enter these areas for to do anything but pvp. 
---
This means that faction imbalances will snowball further unless Blizzard addresses the situation quickly.
---
On top of this the Alliance suffers from a major design flaw. Since the boats are in neutral territory and completely unguarded the horde can camp them all day long and farm massive amounts of honor this way. Not only will there be constant stream of new players to kill, players will also be resurrected every time the boat leaves the area. If the Horde manages to kill players before they manage to jump onto the boat (which isn't too difficult really) they will get 3 honorable kills for every player that switches continents and they can easily get 5 if the also camp the flight master.
---
Meanwhile it's almost worthless for alliance pvp groups to constantly clear the boats since the camper won't give any more honor after a view minutes. 
---
This makes traveling for alliance an absolute pain in the ass even on a somewhat balance server since no one's gonna bother clearing the boats all day long for no real benefit. Obviously it's neither feasible to look for a raid group everytime you wanna head over to kalimdor nor to look for a mage and fly all the way down from darnassus which can easily take 20 minutes.
---
You can win over enemy territory if ther are resources to be had there.  
---
As long as the game revolves around resources used for crafting and progression along with areas with high-yield dungeons, there will be a war to control them as much as possible on a PvP server.
---
thousand needles starts at low 30s and progresses upward, you'll be fine.
---
The actual comparison would be if the people driving on the shoulder are the only ones who get to work on time, and the other ones who play nice don't. If you're a nice guy and you don't farm easy honor you're going to be left behind by the ones who do. The more ruthless your pvp behavior is the more you're rewarded for it. And the only downside is when ally leave the server, and that punishes everyone.
---
imagine going to arathi without swimspeed pot and actually getting it, damn your server must be dead af
---
In vanilla allies were not outnumbered.
---
I'd recommend Vuhdo for a healer.  Gives you a TON of options for customization.
---
Always filthy undead. I feel dirty even agreeing with an Alliance on that, but there's no alternative.
---
Oh, am I getting worked up over a video game? Huh, here I thought I was being harrassed by half a dozen or so people over things I never said.
---
Probably some. PvE racials matter more in later content (AQ/Naxx) by which time PvP gear also becomes obselete, so horde will be less interesting by then.
---
&gt;Where are you getting your numbers from? 
---
Census addon scans, like anyone else.
---
&gt;Blizzard has already stated that medium realms are larger than any vanilla realm, and have provided no information that this has changed since layering was removed
---
Blizzard has also already stated: 
---
&gt;Each layer is effectively going to be what a healthy server was at launch in 2004 in terms of the number of people it holds.
---
and 
---
&gt;we go to phase two, of having all layers stable and having a single layer for each realm as the end state
---
See? Things HAVE changed since delayering. Your statement was before it happened. Delayering results in concurrent online cap of a server being reduced accordingly.
---
&gt;Even taking your argument at face value that still leaves a majority of realms high or full, which is still drastically larger than anything in vanilla
---
Sigh. You were just proven wrong on your own example. Name me another server then? I repeat, you are unlikely to see concurrent online more than 7k (and that would be for servers people were told not to create accounts at before launch or transfer from after launch so no one will pay attention to their overcrowded complaints), and ~3-4k concurrent for the most realms, or even less, which isn't "drastically larger than anything in vanilla"
---
At least there is still fresh bread for sale
---
I think you can still play the game and doesnt really matter how many are there in the other faction unless your main goal is to fuck them all up...
---
This does seem like outdated game design. #NOCHANGES
---
&gt;  So you have an entire group of people who just don't care about min-maxing PvE content and are quintessentially selfish to the point where they are going to do what they want until the world is destroyed 
---
Yikes
---
You can’t bop people outside your party chief.
---

---
Paladins/shamans would indeed get shafted. An acceptable drawback. Quests/Rep can be handled.
---
Gotta agree, this looks cool but lifeless.
---
I think now is a better time than ever to kick the no changes crowd out the door and bring in a new era for classic. I don't see any of those guys in here anymore chanting "No Changes." I'm on a nearly perfect realm (about 45/55), and I'm worried the same gutting will happen to us. Everything is just fine right now with both factions dominating zones at different times. It feels good. I pray it doesn't change.
---
Blizzard has already said "We will do what is right for the players." Or something like that. Clearly we need some reform. We definitely won't see changes until all phases are out and have sunk in for while, if any at all.
---
And what words did I put in your mouth, hmmm?
---
Oh wait, you put a bunch in mine and then attacked me over it.
---
Damn that looks so fucking fun
---
That’s smart! Could you do that?
---
Uh, normal WoW player behavior? Only this time it's in classic, with unbalanced servers.
---
No. Any amount of freedom can and will exploited for dicking around.
---
Loyalty levels are 1 Bar (5% of your level) + time. I think it goes like 0 minutes into 15 30 60 90
---
Do you ever think before you type? Or like, read what you're about to send?
---
Can relate. Just sold the last of my modern magic collect for about half it's value. 750$.
---
Is it possible to get swift wolf pet as Troll? I'd love to get one of these after I turn 60 and farm some gold. How should i go about it, if it's possible?
---
everything is about winning or losing, if you can't see that you are losing a lot.
---
Sell, imo. Since you aren't an Orc are generally better options for you anyway, you can use the money towards something much more impactful like your Lionheart.
---
Wait until the dominant side see how long the BG queues will be. 
---
Back in real vanilla we would wait sometime 1-2days for an Alterac Valley queue because our server was so ally dominant that the only queuing Horde teams were maybe 15-25 guys and they would NEVER solo queue. 
---
So you'll wait for many hours for a BG queue to go up against a full premade. Have fun.
---
You thought you wanted this, but you didn't.
---
The go-to supposedly new internet trash talk word. Ouch my friend, I'm hurt.
---
I have a 60 warlock that I haven't touched since phase 2 on Whitemane. Shit sucks lol. I don't have the time to rank up with my guildies so I just gave up.
---
Yes, we know, not everyone will get rank 13/14.  But, everyone who aspires to will be self-maximizing towards that goal, so if only a couple other players start grinding excess honor they HAVE TO in order to meet their aspirations.
---
No need to be toxic man
---
Except we cram 4x the people into what the server and world was designed for...
---
Leveling in classic is not hard unless u are a solo warrior.  Only thing that makes classic hard is the time it takes to find a group.   Classic is easy.
---
Our guild has 3 bindings 3 BREs 2 Perds but no spinal reaper or eyes
---
It's common knowledge that better players are on horde in retail, so people thought it would be case on classic too.
---
Not forcing, but rewarding - subtle difference
---
ok boomer
---
im sure some are quitting because the faction imbalance (both in the actual design of the game and population numbers).
---
FF memes in my classic wow sub
---
Dear god, the sensitive snowflake horde are back.  Yes, it's nothing faction specific.  You're right about that.  But please stop spamming this fucking shit in every thread, it's so pointless and needy that you constantly seek affirmation that both factions are shitty.
---
Trying to get people to understand this simple concept has filled me with so much face plaming disappointment. 60/40 is 60/40 no matter what. However, the discrepancy between the numbers of each faction increases exponentially when the pop numbers increase by 5x compared to the orginal. Add in that the map is the same size that it was 15 years ago and now you have an overwhelming advantage for the dominate faction. I still done understand how some people will still try and argue this. I am very glad you are part of the few that understand lol
---
Their panties are in a knot
---
When my guild runs raids that's allows pugs in if you dont follow instructions you get a /kick very quick. Helps them learn for next time aswell.
---
You're missing my point. If you treat a finite resource like it's infinite then it will run out. Whether it's an animal population or players' patience is irrelevant. People won't just log on to corpse run all night. They will try to find work arounds if they do want to play, yes, but these are not solutions to the root problem. There is a fundamental problem with server balance and P2 has exacerbated it to the extreme. Hopefully this is just temporary and things will get better with BGs but 99/1 servers are proof that it's not 'sorting itself out'.
---
No it is fucking weird is all. Just plain weird. I have gay friends and they don't scare me at all. Grown men and little boys playing as fem elves and human women is just straight up not right.   
---
I get it, daddy and authority issues that people have these days caused this dampening of the human soul.
---
Pve gear was still heavily used in arenas in tbc for most classes.
---
I get that people didn’t like resilience but arena players have been complaining about needing pve gear since literally the first season. The whole “resilience forced you to get pvp gear” thing has always bothered me because most classes were running around with raid gear in arenas.
---
&gt; It's odd how this shit more or less worked fine back in vanilla, isn't it?
---
This shit wasn't fine in vanilla, it was just 'less' bad.
---
Enough people have and are quitting to warrant Blizzard to be worried, but they just don’t care and haven’t since Wotlk days.
---
God I remember trying to find tanks who would willingly do shattered halls lol, was tough
---
Could adding blood elves and Draenei help this?
---
NOT NICE
---
Bingo.  I abandoned retail for classic, and so far nothing I've seen of Shadowlands is even remotely interesting to me.  I'm predicting a Cataclysm 2.0 situation: an expansion with less new content than typical that will ultimately be poorly received by the players-base due to the time investment necessary to "update" the old world.  Except this time, it's not just Azeroth, it's *every* previous expansion that needs work, and some of that new content time is going into the new starting zones that already level capped players won't care about.
---
Then open up faction transfers. If the overall game is that unbalanced than let people transfer there characters on the server to the other faction.
---
I got tailoring for Robe of the Archmage, never did anything else with it or got any requests to craft anything but tbh I was a bit late with hitting 60.
---
I don't have enchanting so can't say much about that, except you always have a few players trying to sell their enchanting services in major cities so I suppose it's good business.
---
I hit about 37 on my new shaman I made to play with some friends that rolled on Flamelash.  
---
Managed to convince them all to hop over to Earthshaker last minute, but we're only about 4 people or so.  
---
Earthshaker seems nice however, just need to find a guild now.
---
I think it's reasonable for a feral/resto spec to roll on healing gear, but only if they state that that's their plan before the run starts such that any healer has the option of finding a different group if they dislike that.
---
Arise my champion.
---
Oh really? I didn’t figure that by the last 10 posts
---
you've won this thread, lets all move on now, nothing more to see
---
The guild hurricane is incredibly active in world pvp. Try to figure out where they are pvping and level there once you get to the higher brackets.
---
playing on a PVE server  and i taught i would just pvp in Bg's but Hillsbrad is  a war zone... even in other zones i saw people run around with pvp on .
---
All of my guild is happy we chose pve  server  even after 15 years of playing on a PVP server , we expected it to be bad.. but not like this to be honest
---
I was considering making an Alliance rogue aswell and just be an assassin.
---
Blizzard has been ignoring classic. They aren't putting any man power and resources towards it. It's kinda like a "you wanted it so fuck you"
---
Use cloak :D
---
By making a Mage alt.
---
Take a look at Blizzard’s Q3 financials, they are still dying. If they allocate more resource on a 15 year old, small to non profitable project, they will be in huge trouble. 
---
In addition, classic is only popular on twitch for a few weeks, the total sub in this September (classic + retail) is still lower than the month when BFA drops.
---
Lol man they're terrible at spreading cream cheese aren't they?
---
Stop blaming the players for making rational choices within a broken system that Blizzard implemented.
---
Grobb as a server is great as a whole. There is an amazing RP community Horde side, which is where I play so I cannot speak for the alliance. The only thing I know about Ally is thru rumors and my own experiences (which are mostly bad because I suck at pvp so I won’t color your view of them). I do know Hurricane is a big guild ally side and are good at pvp, they tend to immerse themselves in lots of wpvp content.
---
Grobb has two very active discord communities where cross faction events are posted and the Reddit is also very popular.
---
If you do roll an alt on Grobb, I’d reach out to the guilds in whatever faction you end up deciding on and get yourself into a friendly one so youthat have backup and people to help you level. :) solo will be more difficult due to the gank squads on both sides roaming the world. 
---
It’s very very active from 5pm - 1am PST.
---
EDIT: there is toxicity due to the HK system without BGs like on most PvP servers, which is why I suggest joining a guild ASAP. But you take the good with the bad and it’s not the whole of the community.
---
Might explain all the crying
---
It's easy depending on your class, and if you're killing mobs of your level (+1) one at a time. I haven't played retail but its my understanding that dying is a lot more common in Classic.
---
I know that it's tough to give up 3 months of work, but it's a sunk coat falesy. Your character isn't going anywhere, you're just taking a break to check out greener pastures. You should try a new realm and a new class and just give it a whirl. Think of it as an alt. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. You'll make new friends and find a nice guild and before you know you're back in the swing of things. We don't want you to leave. This game is only so great because of the people who play it.
---
I would also add not being able to kill the same person 5-6 times before they stop giving you honor and maybe also tweak the fact that if a 60 kills a 48 they get exactly 1 honor for doing so.
---
&gt; Why would Blizzard want its profitable game to fail?
---
Because the people in charge are hyper narcissistic and worry only about their desires over the communities. Retail has been lead on a slope to doom for expansion after expansion, only ever temporarily rebounding during new expansion launch hype before immediately dropping because Ion Hazzicostas fancies himself a king and warps the games to his desires rather than what gets subscribers. 
---
With that context stated and out of the way JAB fucking hates Classic, he always did, he's the one that told everyone they didn't want it, he's the one who lied about source code and continues to act like a passive aggressive asshat every time interviews with him talk about Classic, and he's now King Shit of the Turd Island that is modern Blizzard after Morhaime bailed. Surely the money is nice, but for people with a chip on their shoulders, creating the destiny of making themselves right is more important. This isn't new to CEOs, this isn't new to game companies. JAB would be hiding an erection while announcing Classic shutting down.
---
All of dire maul is the same instance. You can die in East and res in West or north too.
---
Here it is: both sides arguements often assume both sides are equally guilty. If a kid beats their bully up once, I wouldn't say both the kid and the bully are violent if the bully beat him up daily.
---
Imagine believing the Earth is a sphere. Fucking fools
---
Of course not. If you couldn't bop someone why would you be able to grief them even worse?
---
[My face when reading this comment.](https://imgur.com/47yTi9A)
---
Check out some videos on ZF graveyard farming.
---
Yea and the end game zones were literally made with flying in mind lol.
---
Had the opposite effect originally.  Blood elf aesthetics and racial drove more people to the horde.
---
People said no changes which mean doing anything to force ques people wouldve nerd rage... this is the playerbase fault not blizzard
---
You must see that right? What ever blizzard does people hate on them for it, they can never win, so they tried to recreate classic as well as they could and then u had idiots running around in 40 man squads and if u said something against it u would here ''looks like pvp happened on a pvp server'' ''go to retail'' ''roll pve'' i can go on? This is the horde fault on flamelash and they should stay there and get all the shit for destroying there realm
---
Venture (the alliance guild) and a few others got 60 real fast, started camping the shit out of every lower level Horde in leveling areas.  
---
Alliance was at around 37% at this point.  
---
Horde got pissed, once p2 came about those 37% alliance got farmed into the fucking earth as retaliation for making so many Horde players leveling experience miserable.  
---
Come the last 5 days of the free transfer and every Alliance guild transferred off along with quite a few Horde players as people realized that the server is dead.  
---
Eye for an eye makes the whole world blind and all that.
---
Horde here. Not sure how it is on your end but I like our server. Sure it’s gotten worse with P2 but it’s been alright for me.
---
Does zf still give xp on the way to 60? Thought maybe about DM
---
It’s fine dude, but yeah we don’t use “like” with how. Great video!
---
He was using his lvl 1 to show an example of the horde brutality.
---
It’s honestly not that hard to understand.
---
&gt;My server is too full time to unsub
---
Lmao wow players at their finest
---
There's a reason UD is the largest percentage of horde players and it's definitely not their appearance.
---
This is really awesome. This makes me want to start  a similar thing for my server. Wishing you all the best of luck!
---
Reminder that the version of AV we are getting in  classic is the 5 min baserace version.
---
Enjoy!
---
Is it? Well then 3 out of what, 30? 
---
It doesn't really change the fact Horde outside of pve realms and 3 pvp realms own wpvp
---
lol keep up the delusion buddy. It's definitely not the companies job to plan accordingly and make sure their are balanced servers to meet the demand. Nope definitely not blizzards job as the creator and decision maker. It's the player bases fault, yes yes.
---
Imagine giving Blizzard cover for any decision they make they will get hated for, that's a non argument. Just admit they fucked up with not taking the measures VERY EARLY on Classic launch and the weeks after to make sure the factions dispersed relatively well across servers. The fact that the server was 70/30 before world pvp, and you blame the horde for killing people to get honor in phase 2. Just stop typing and go ponder for a while and come back.
---
rip
---
Yep, I absolutely agreed, WoW graphic style looks 100 times better than my version
---
Don't forget orc rogue.
---
&gt;The distinguishing factor for WoW is getting to show off the PvE gear you worked for.
---
No? Having elite pvp gear is way cooler to show off than some raid loot lmao
---
rerolling as a horde will only exacerbate the problem. find a relatively balanced server and go alliance there.
---
any new gold farming methods coming in with p3 I should be aware of?
---
The population are just pussies now. Back in the day when one faction was pushing some capital pvp it went out in /world and motherfuckers dropped what they were doing.
---
Now you just hear "nah I'm farming bis", "just log until they go away" etc. Zoomers really are fucking pussies, but of course I blame their parents.
---
Search your feelings, you know it to be true.
---
Can you transfer from pvp to rppvp realms?
---
&gt;Venture (the alliance guild) and a few others got 60 real fast, started camping the shit out of every lower level Horde in leveling areas.  
---
&gt;Eye for an eye makes the whole world blind and all that.
---
To quote my post above listening to my friends leveling on the server, they were some of the first Horde 60's on Flamelash.
---
Guess Im going to have to camp lvl 20 questing zones to keep the server pop even
---
Are there any late night guilds? I'm on a west coast server while in eastern time because I work until midnight most nights. And honestly I'd debate rerolling horde to alliance over there because arcanite reaper is super unbalanced in the opposite direction of most servers.
---
I see tons of ally doing group farming, while horde Engages in a lot more 1v1s in response to that, then goes about their day
---
nah for pvp the rake is the best one
---
40v1 with macro spam 2 seconds after you land. Followed by an hour of corpse camping and instant kill macro spam
---
Said that since months. Nobody was listening here and said layering is needed, starting with too much realms would be dumb because we would see dead realms after some months.
---
Guess what? Now we see what happens with a system of layering instead of more realms, they couldn’t and still can’t scale back to vanilla caps because the queues would be immense, just not enough servers for the sheer amount of players that wanted to keep playing the game. 
---
They calculated that 80-90% of the players will quit by P2. Close miss heh..
---
40 year old Asmongold
---
Yeah it would really be nice to see them fix this but I’d be surprised if it had a very big impact. Some people just genuinely enjoy knowing you’re miserable and that’s all there is to it for them. I don’t like it but is what it is and I can mostly just suck it up and deal. My server is one of the better balanced ones though so there are times it’s really bad and times it’s not bad at all.
---
Spotted the horde, do I win a prize?
---
I love Blizzard and I'll continue to have faith. Maybe that's stupid of me but I'm not going to throw them into the muck because of this. There are devs on that team who really do care.
---
Blizzard inspired me to become a game developer, and I did it. This might be sad but my life would really not be the same without them.
---
You didn't reserve it, and the priest could have healed the instance. It's an upgrade, so he can Need. You are overcomplicating things or assuming people know more than the N/G system as implemented in-game. It sucks, but this is what it is.
---
I think they should just do seasons with rewards.
---
This season is vanilla, next year is TBC, then WoTLK, then vanilla again. 
---
Start on fresh realms with fresh characters on the vanilla cycle where you keep nothing.
---
Edit: on second thought maybe keep your name and your guild.  Everything else goes.
---
And yet the mods removed your comment asserting that I lost and now nobody but you can see it.
---
Really gets your noggin joggin about the accuracy of your worldview, doesn't it?
---
I mean yeah I get that but if playing ret is what he wants to do in WoW he should just play it. 
---
If he wants to top dps charts and hardcore raid ect. He wouldn’t be here asking this question. He wants to have fun and if playing ret is fun to him whatever, he should do it. I’m sure he could find a guild with the same mindset.

In all fairness stealth doesn't work when you're that white.
---
ZF gives exp until 55, when you could go to DM to farm lashers, or find a BRD spellcleave. Alternatively go to WPL to farm the zombies in the fields if your server allows it.
---
I hate it
---
Having last stand + improved blood rage is quite nice, though 31/20/0 is tempting as others have pointed out here.
---
Yeah lol it's a massive benefit
---
Also helps that we started this whole adventure with 1.12 itemization and stats. It would have been ALOT different if we started at any other patch
---
https://i.imgflip.com/2/1otri4.jpg
---
But it didn't, like you obviously see tons more people in the world now than you did before layer removal. Blizzard also never said anything about it so you're just making assumptions out of thin air.
---
Yeah. You have to be a fucking drooling donkey to farm honor in this phase.
---
That's why blizzard did a mistake by releasing battleground separated from phase 2.
---
Do you think the horde thinks its fun or rather necessary?
---
Do you think farming BRD arena 10 hours a day to get BIS chest is fun?
---
When there is BIS items on the line alot of people do crazy shit for it.
---
I can’t speak for Warmane, but it was definitely a thing on Nost and a massive problem as Alliance on Elysium/LH.
---
I mean that you just roam around clean up and don't reeally stand on one point. It's mental if you'd bring this many people to camp some fp campers.
---
But yeah whatever dude, can't really convince you since you already gave up from the beginning.
---
Or point out a real one lol
---
I don't farm honor, am rank 4. I'll aim for R10 when BGs releases, I don't see any issue. Or are you saying that the droves of dummies are delusionnal enough to think they're going to reach R14 within 12 weeks?
---
no u
---
What chest is that?
---
This guy is on Kirtonos if anyone was wondering.
---
The devs decided to have servers way larger than vanilla
---
It's more that majority of players what want to play aggressively select Horde as their faction.  
---
Horde have better PvP racials and whole image of Horde created by Blizzard shout "we are the brutal killers".  
---
So players in this two factions are already different even before they start playing.  
---
P.S. In WotLK Blizz give humans the best PvP passive (EMfH) and majority of professional PvP players instantly switched to Alliance :)
---
Thanks mate, winter is coming and I needed salt for my driveway
---
Sap lock kill pet ezpz
---
Snow?
---
These are secret alliance plans and not meant for you.
---
You cant force people to play a faction/races they dont want to play even if you made alliance racials better then hordes, people simply like the races of the horde more its as simple as that, go figure humans dont want to play humans in a fantasy mmorpg!
---
100% what I thought
---
I was just looking at server populations the other day. The most populated classic servers seem to be in the range of 70-80k players whereas on retail the more populated servers have over 400k. Even the lowest population servers on retail are over 100k.
---
Im the other Redditor known as "kid funky fried"
---
&gt;*complaining about the game =/= it will turn into retail*
---
It happened before, I'd prefer it didn't happen again.
---
And there's nothing wrong with that as long as they are enjoying the game.
---
For what it’s worth, I play alliance on a PvP server that isn’t super unbalanced. I’m sure Horde is favored but there’s Alliance out in the world pwning horde all the time.
---
Thatsapenis.gif
---
That's one of the main issues.. Too many uninformed delusionals that believe they'll get rank 14 on those mega server.
---
Not true.
---
&gt;So you're saying that alliance on herod *aren't* badasses fighting the good fight against an enemy twice their size and still giving them a run for their money despite being so outnumbered?
---
I am saying more often than not we arent. It takes place, maybe more so than other servers with faction imbalance. But not enough to convey any type of notion that our faction is healthy.
---
&gt;I don't know why you'd want to sell your faction short, honestly.
---
&gt;Since honor came out, I haven't been able to make it to dungeons without running into an alliance zerg utterly decimating groups of horde much larger than them, and/or roaming gank squads of well-geared, well-organized alliance PvPers.
---
I am sure you haven't or implying that this doesn't take place. It's just tenfold less of an experience to what the alliance are currently experiencing. You are getting rained on. We are getting hailed on.
---
&gt;Sure, they eventually get overwhelmed by horde's backup, but I doubt many of those horde players (myself included) would do half as well in those cases.
---
&gt;I also found it near-impossible to level up from 52~60 on my mage alt without getting very, very, sneaky and/or playing at 3~6am server time (the only time the sheer extent of faction imbalance is tangible for horde players, as zones like WPL/EPL/SG/etc go from 5~10 alliance marauders and 10~20 horde corpsewalkers to 0~1 alliance and 10 horde)
---
&gt;I know it sucks to be alliance on herod, but trust me when I say that your faction has a lot to be proud of and you guys are punching well above your weight class.
---
This is nice of you to say mate. I know it comes off as a Debbie downer with my perspective but at the end of the day I just see our numbers dwindling at a rate far more rapidly than anything I have experienced yet. The AH is showing it, the guild online numbers are showing it, and the overall feeling of despair to play is evident still. People are quitting. Every day.
---
&gt;P2 has been a bloodbath for me and despite my leveling grinding to a halt, herbing/mining/fishing becoming impossible, and dungeons taking ages to get to during peak hours, the only thing I'd trade it for is perfect 50:50.
---
&gt;I'm actually kind of scared for you guys come the 10th because all your best men will be in BGs instead of contesting the open world zones as strongly as they do.
---
I am really hoping we can get back to our true competitive war in openworld with the BGs. I am also afraid it might not work and be the final straw that sends us to the ultimate faction collapse.
---
That dude.
---
Are you speaking about non-combat pets or mounts?  
---
Pets could be get by anyone.  
---
For mounts it's trickier - you need to be exalted with corresponding faction. In your case - Orgrimar. IIRC it cost around 300-400g in Runecloth donations, so you could start collecting it now.
---
It’s a well balanced and healthy PvP server.  If you’re out in the world you should be prepared to take advantage of the enemy or defend yourself at all times.  During peak hours you’ll easily find a fight or it’ll find you.  In the off hours you can quest or farm with minimal interference.  This is all the truth and I’m sorry you’ve had a bad experience.  Maybe a PvP mmo is not for you.
---
Thank you will giver a shot
---
Yea like I said, gaming has changed a lot in 15 years. People are a lot more competitive, methodical and optimized than they were back in vanilla. Honor grinders existed, but they were far from the norm. Most of the people I talk to in my guild and see streaming don't even enjoy the honor grind. They find it incredibly tedious and laborious, but still do it because it's a task that's been given and it offers rewards. 
---
Server size also matters a lot. Vanilla servers had a way lower pop than classic ones, so it was never this much of a cluster fuck anyway
---
Where is rule 7?
---
You talked about the loot rules beforehand, and the spriest was rolling offspec. There's nothing you can do about it, but you were in the right here, and sounds like a group of assholes.
---
Moving forward, your best bet is to try to make parties full of people that wouldn't roll on the loot, so basically no priests, paladins, or other druids (though a feral might be ok, it's still a risk). That's what I do when I want something specific.
---
On the bright side, you've discovered 4 people that you can avoid in the future.
---
Horde have better racials. 
---
More people rolled horde for those racials. 
---
Server imbalances accrued. 
---
World PVP honor system was engaged. 
---
Alliance was out numbered on most servers and got tired of roving 40man horde raids in every zone so they stopped leaving major cities other than raiding. 
---
Horde became desperate for honor so if even 1 alliance was spotted in a zone, multiple raids would descend on them. Which made alliance even less likely to leave a city. 
---
So few alliance in the world resulted in horde becoming desperate enough to go to the alliance capital cities in order to find honor. 
---
Alliance no longer need to leave Ironforge to get their honor because the horde comes to them. 
---
The unspoken part of this chain of events is that battlegrounds drop, alliance insta queue and finally get a fair fight and never need to leave their cities again. Horde meanwhile have long queue times due to not enough alliance to go around and either quit, re-roll alliance, server xfer (good luck finding a non horde dominated server) or fight like madmen for the occasional world pvp encounter with an alliance.
---
All the triggered hordes in here is the true content

He's cool with the bouncers so they let him in

[Jame's Alliance Leveling Guide - Chapter I (30-41) [old version]](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version)
---
one billion percent certain.
---
You are going to DPS very slowly. And by slowly I mean Fucking slow.
---
Alliance players bitching about Horde players, and everyone bitching that Undead shouldn't be a playable race or should be their own faction because Alliance players rage quit over all the Undead rogues that they've been warned are prominent in vanilla.
---
Also doesn't help with how garbage the current WoW lore surrounding Sylvanas is and them writing Undead to be a flat generic evil race anymore
---
also should have kept faction balance in check by limiting the amount of people on a realm in each faction. 
---
like, give each faction x slots(each unique players  is 1 slot, multiple chars dont count as extra slot, but still limit  char amount, so people dont reserve all names), if one faction is at its limit then dont allow new people to make a char on that realm and wait for the other faction to catch up. after that give both factions more slots. still give it a buffer, but atleast make sure that the difference doesnt get too big.
---
 have  a maximum limit of total unique players, take into consideration that a lot of players could quit or are simply not online at the same time. we have enough data to find a good number. if the amount of unique player is still too big then offer free faction transfers.
---
 its not perfect and i can think of multiple flaws already, but better than nothing.
---
in addition have faction queues on pvp realms, share amount of active players on each realm, have free char transfer for the dominant faction if the realm is too big with queues to realms where the faction is outnumbered.
---
in hindsight this is pretty easy to say and will fix some issues, but it wont stop people from camping and minmaxing their honor. so yea, most people complaining now  should have played on a pve realm in the first place tbh especially the "i just want to chill, quest and do my stuff, my time is so precious, but i dont have so much time to spend it corpserunnning" faction
---
When fun comes at others expense to the point that no one will play the game with you any more, something is wrong with you, full stop.
---
You really don’t need to zoom. I do it like once a day. If I need to it’s page up and page down
---
If you want to blame blizzard for making one of the factions inferior in all aspects causing less people to join them it would be a legitimate complaint. It's clear the horde is objectively better in all regards. 
---
But that's not what people are crying about the are crying about the honor system.
---
I’m torn with this because I enjoy flying and love it for the exploring aspect (and maybe a little rp aspect, being a Druid), but I also see the valid complaints about how it makes the world feel smaller, easier even for quests (if you’re still doing them at cap), and lessens the chance you may run into someone else for pvp. 
---
Lame, but in BC some of my favorite memories were flying up to the floating rocks in Nagrand with friends and just hanging out enjoying the beautiful scenery. This also arguably made pvp more dangerous, in case you died up there lol.
---
and they still won't get it.
---
So what do you expect to happen if he does stop? Everyone else also stops farming honor to let everyone quest in peace and alliance comes back? I really don't understand in what world you guys live in, but I guess it's easy to just complain on reddit and downvote whatever you disagree with instead of thinking
---
We call this "Soul" vs "Soulless".
---
High fidelity graphics tend to end up looking Soulless because they try to capture real life too much and completely forget to have a distinctive style that can look even decades from now.
---
OK, I'll have to take my 20g and move on.
---
MOUSE WHEEL DANCERS REPRESENT
---
People wanted Classic WoW, but they were given Retail server numbers on Patch 1.12.
---
No doubt
---
Oof, too real
---
240g per day would be a better comparison when talking about bots.
---
It looks eerie as hell, but the colours aren't as warm as WoW? I wish I knew but it does look awesome.
---
...so you don't like pvp? You're saying this would be a problem if the servers were 50/50 and it was happening equally to each faction? You would still think that it is a problem that people are camping and roaming in kills squads around the world. Now I'm curious.
---
Horrible of them, especially since you talked about it beforehand.
---
Not really useless, hemo rogues enjoy the slow swing speed.
---
I mean the largest/loudest crowd were solidly against any changes from 1.12 because they didn't trust Blizzard making them. That's how you end up with 15 years old game design.
---
You rip what you sow. You cannibalized your own selfs. Live with the consequences.  
---
\-An alliance.
---
Faction queues, or reduced subscription cost (lol I know, I too giggled when I wrote it) for those who play on the bad side of a faction imbalance.
---
ill trade my wotf for shadowmeld or 5% int
---
No, because it can be easily abused, if some raid decides to take 5 level 1 characters with them that just suicide into other raids for the sake of DHs, people WILL abuse it.
---
Perhaps if they gave us a month warning and then randomly assigned all guilds as a whole to new servers with perfect action balance. You would stay with your guild and probably lose the community you had on the server but it would be balanced!
---
For me personally, that’s a lot of time investment to just give up on. I’d say finish dungeon leveling and just play normally on the server at this point. BGs will be cross realm so that won’t feel as awful as the world has for you.
---
I have read the griefing horde story a few times. But this situation is playing out on other servers aswell. It's the imbalance that is the problem, not some griefing that happened.
---
I'm pretty sure this would have happened on my server aswell, but they closed alliance transfers down on mine.
---
Honor is a system in the game that directly rewards you for killing as many people as possible, no matter how. Playing with the toy means being toxic. You can either help breaking it, or not play with it. Literally the only two options.
---
I had Strike of the Hydra and the levels until WW Axe were completely trivialized by it.
---
Yeah, those people who didn't take part in the ganking totally deserve a dead server. Those are the only people who really suffer from this, the gankers already transferred.
---
It does work because people understand what's being conveyed. That's what language is about. it can be grammatically imperfect and still work. You're being obtuse
---
Except it was to make the content easier at the time. They wanted the casuals to get into raids before moving on with TBC. The answer was to buff items and talents alongside some nerfs.
---
I’ve played vanilla for 6 years now
---
Windfury makes 2hers a lot more desirable
---
I get its bcuz competitive doesnt allow addons but its classic, maybe use weakauras?
---
Absolutely, I quit retail several years ago for a reason
---
Not sure what game you're playing but people camp thorium point and patrol around searing gorge all the fucking time. I play horde and I stopped trying to get honor in searing gorge because if an alliance bothers existing anywhere in that area they're already dead before I can even mount up to them. Horde dont need to be near capitals when they already dominate almost every server. Kargath may as well be considered a horde cap at this point.
---
What are Blizzards options here? Making flight masters aggressive to the other faction and making them raid bosses, buffing city guards to God tier! Adding negative honor for multiple kills of the same player in a short amount of time? What is the move?
---
Again, people have literally been waiting for authentic legacy servers for more than ten years. Now, after ten years of "you think you do but you don't", Blizzard finally gave them what they wanted. Hell, many of those people probably went through high school, finished college, got married and started raising children in the time it took Blizz to fulfill their wish.
---
Introducing changes for people that just stumbled across Classic and happened to like it would be a huge middle finger to a large chunk of the playerbase.
---
Bartender, Questie (because there's tons of quests on the second floor of the building\cellar\behind corner where you will never check), Auctionator (because default AH UI is one of the worst thing in the history).
---
yeah mate thats where you are wrong. nobody chooses to be outnumbered 3:1 in every "fight". 
---
literally anyone who started on a pvp server did it because they wanted to experience an rpg with a taste of faction war. 
---
This of course includes getting killed from time to time.
---
But atm most pvp servers are literally unplayable for the outnumbered faction (mostly alliance) because you spend more time beeing dead than anything else.
---
this is obviously not how the system was intended and obviously not how the major part of the pvp community wanted it to be.
---
Good for you? The sooner you get R10 the sooner you get the items, and the more chances you'll have to stay on top and ahead of the pack. It's really not hard to understand why someone would want to have a head start on the honor farm..
---
They released Blood Elves in TBC because people were picking Alliance too often, so they added a "pretty" race to try and bring balance to it. This amount of Horde players is the complete opposite to Vanilla. I know that Lord of the Rings isn't still as big as it was, but I'm not sure what else apart from the racials could have really tipped the balance so hard.
---
Uh, yes, because "nochange" population did ask for 5x more people on each realm. Oh, wait...
---
 #logic
---
&gt; You say they've increased the number of players per layer
---
I didn't
---
&gt; Also note how this realm capacity increase comes after Ion giving his statement in the interview so things very well could have changed.
---
By how much more, exactly? 500 more players concurrently? Or 15,000 more players concurrently? This is why it's so hard to believe that Blizzard decided to go strict #nochanges on almost everything else but then cryptically hinted that they were going back on their word for concurrent players despite prior statements to the contrary. It's all too vague to draw any conclusions off of.
---
And according to the original WoW devs, server concurrent player cap was also dynamic, which could be what we're experiencing on the largest servers today.
---
This isn't a playstyle nor it is "pvp". It's a toxic, unplayable grief-fest. You are obviously horde.
---
I don't agree one bit, but I do hope you some day get to play a TBC classic, you deserve it as much as we do
---
Mage does more damage overall compared to WL and will continue to do so all the way throughout classic. The gap will get significantly smaller as gear progresses through raid tiers and warlocks can actually get hitcapped, but mage will still pull ahead. WL is still a strong dps class regardless and brings a lot of other stuff to the table that mages dont.
---
Finding a raid spot is much easier as a WL though since there just a whole lot more mages.
---
If you like big numbers in general WL will also crit for much higher amounts than mages will because of Ruin. But Dps overall is still less than what mages can do.
---
What I mean is never play with shadow/ele/enhancer/ret/feral/boomkin.
---
Man thats a whole lot of conjecture. How would you have any idea how I play the game? Also its insane to think you have such a massive ego that you can tell me that I am playing a video game wrong. Really? Im playing a game the way that I enjoy and this is wrong? Lets forget about the fact that you have **NO** idea how im playing to begin with, but you think you are the arbiter of how to play a game "correctly"?  
---
Also no matter how you, personally, want to classify it. WoW is a video game. If you stop playing it today, its not any different from if you were to stop playing idk call of duty or something, because both games really require you to play with others to get enjoyment out of it. Does this suddenly make CoD or any multiplayer shooter game of your choice a "SOCIAL game"? No. Its a video game.  
---
I dont know why you decided to go on a tirade about "today's gamer". Because that doesnt apply to me. Stop acting like you know everything.
---
Permadeath mode? LOL. Another lesson from osrs, hardcore mode just means who can survive long enough until they eventually get dc'd and die.
---
lol smashing the Alliance so hard they go extinct
---
Oh really ?
---
That's why it was called world of roguecraft back on the day lol
---
Well burden of proof is on you then to make some "real checking". Already proved you wrong on dual specs and achievements yet you say im wrong. Okay, show me a source.
---
Disagree here, I could care less about the community on either.  I'm in classic so I can have a real talent tree and play the classes before they ruined them with pruning.
---
Dinging 70 on my prot pally and slowly grinding my way through all these "end game" dungeons then running my first heroic... Then eventually building a core group of people to reliably burn through any heroic we wanted, perfect step stone into Kara, my first raid. Stayed with those same people through t6. 
---
You call em loot tubes, I call em the best damn gaming experience I've ever had.
---
I got annoyed with the constant corpse runs last night so I logged on to my lvl6 mage for a change of pace. I’d like to thank the parade of horde marching past me to IF for simply waving and not murdering me.
---
Least it was a reason to log in
---
Why go in classic atm? Only got honor in a horrible system
---
I don't want to have to reboot my machine each time I play game / work.
---
Tried it, 4/10 would not recommend.
---
My machine contains a Windows 10 SSD filled with games. Haven't booted on it since more than 1 year ago.  
---
I play games that works on Linux instead.
---
In my case, having a powerful Linux machine outweigh having more game choices.
---
Cool, thanks for the advice
---
Undead rogue
---
It's world of WARcraft not world of LETTHEENEMYLIVEcraft
---
GoToReTaIl
---
No transfers are open as of yet.
---
So by that logic there is no PvP in the PvE servers which we know is not the case.
---
I was mostly looking to make my own gear since I don't raid.
---
Imagine playing Horde. nothnx
---
I just don't see an easy solution to the problem. Merging servers is a possibility but still extremely difficult as you can not break up existing servers. This means that the only way to merge servers is to create new mega servers witch also will make people angry
---
&gt;It's as if none of you have read about moral hazards, decisions analysis, or really have any concept of human society as a system. You're blind to it and all you can see is individual moral failings. Like WTF?
---
yeah most people that play video games are kids
---
Just a tip you can youtube/google your class + classic gold farm and you'll generally get good videos/guides on decent gold farms for your specific class. It's important because some classes excel at certain gold farms while others excel at others. Like a priest can't stealth LBRS to farm patterns like a rogue can, but a rogue can't farm DME or AOE farm like mages can.
---
No, it's white; and longer than the average cape
---
I don't follow. Go on and spell out what you're trying to imply.
---
And, you have to kill them as soon as possible before someone else does - Meaning you have to get them at the Flight Paths, and corpse-camp them for maximum honor - if you want to 'honorably' kill them while they're out questing/fighting over dungeon access or devilsaurs, you're going to be waiting forever because they're dead the moment the debuff wears off at the flightpoint..
---
It's literally the Tragedy of the Commons.
---
This is a line we'll have to cross after naxx are about to release. With the success of OSRS I do think it can be done in a similar fashion for wow but it's a real thin line to walk. Classic has it's issues but they are also very much part of the experience for many. 
---
Adding more content for max level? Not far from the emissaries and dailies plaguing retail. Reworking honor system, when will the community push for easier epics and then turning it into "Welfare epics"? 
---
For this to even remotely work, we as a community have to really look back to ourselves. Can we come up with good ideas which can be implemented without ruining the core experience? I would love classic+ after Naxx but my biggest issue with it is how do we make sure the rest of our community are on-board with this?
---
The amount of rank 14's given scales with population so megaservers get multiple every week.
---
I can't speak for alliance, as I am a horde player, but I play from West coast and have no trouble finding stuff late night. Horde do have a slightly higher pop though
---
Yeah, that's a good point.
---
You're overestimating how much one bot can bring to an economy of 10 000 players. Depends on the server of course. But this sub has way too many people freaking about about "ruined economy" when nothing is happening.
---
Personally I wouldn't reroll but if you are I would go undead over orc for rogue.
---
Missed opportunity
---
https://streamable.com/okicw
---
So not only does alliance have shitty players, they also have griefers.
---
*complains in Dwarf*
---
I like this analogy. What I would say though is that the need for oversight from a government exists because of the lack of morality of some people. The government wouldnt need to regulate as strongly if every asshole out there wasnt trying to squeeze every penny possible. But they exist, so they do. So in this case blizz acts as the regulating force for the players. Blizz didnt do their job, so this is what we get. But at the end of the day, asshole players shouldnt be absolved of blame.
---
I like flying mounts, I like daily quests, I like dual wield enhancement shamans, but I just want a fucking talbuk again.
---
Here's how to fix it, it's really easy. 
---
You know how theres a guild on Flamelash called 'the Leftovers' who are hilariously trying to fight 100 Ironforge Invaders 24/7. Ya, have a GM bestow a title on them... "Hero"... back in classic very rarely a GM has done something totally unique, this might be an occasion. 
---
Honor their struggle with some purely cosmetic bullshit. A hilarious promo video on the front page of the site with their names visible.  Watch people re-roll to be part of a real resistance, as long as it's being acknowledged via the main website. 
---
Promote the underdog.
---
Absolutely!
---
&gt;Which has no visible quality control measures to show accuracy.
---
Still way better and accurate than your "dude trust me" source. Also the code is on github, feel free to QA if you feel yourself capable. You are also free to handwave any fact which doesn't support your narrative but don't expect anyone to take you seriously after that.
---
&gt;Not only have they manipulated layer sizes since that post, there is no indication that they reduced the amount of players online.
---
Except there is, in a blue post? Otherwise you might want to explain how servers with 2 layers were warned to have a long queue after set to 1 layer and they indeed had it?
---
&gt;You are even admitting in your last response that there are servers with concurrent populations online of 7k
---
Slightly less, yeah. Not "most" but some exceptions, and these servers, as I said, were target of Blizzard warnings and servers were listed as overcrowded. If you haven't transferred, this means you wanted to play on a server with concurrent online more than vanilla one. As in, your own fault and choice.
---
Again, most servers are roughly equal to high/full vanilla in terms of population: not "drastically larger". Well, even 2x populated aren't drastically larger, but whatever, they are an exception anyway.
---
It seems obvious to me that their entire classic team was moved to porting TBC. The bump in subscribers, that they used to appeal stockholders this past quarter, can only be seen by releasing an entire new expansion.
---
The Undead can take the gnomes too. They've been mooching off the dwarves long enough.
---
&gt; You can’t just use an outlier as an example lol.
---
You are commenting on a video of Flamelash server, the biggest outlier.  60/40 servers are nothing like this.
---
Depends if you think it's worth releveling to 54. That's only a few days left til 60, but a few months to 60 if it took you that long to get there the first time. Maybe wait til BGs come out and see how it goes? BGs SHOULD solve a lot of the world pvp problem. There will always be world pvp but it won't be as bad just because people can BG now for their honor instead of camp BRM and shit all day.
---
Going to miss the Alliance tears when BGs come out.
---
Wait who am I kidding? Alliance cried like little girls before P2 and they will keep crying long after.
---
Environment is nice but characters look very bland
---
ye, and most of them are fucking quitters and safespace  babies who shouldnt have played on a pvp realm in the first place. i was part of the minority faction and we made it work by being smarter and more organised until all these people took the easy way out which ruined the experience for people on both factions.
---
in the end both sides just care about their own interests. the difference is that one group is playing within the established rules and the other expects people to grief/sacrifice their own progress.
---
Wat
---
Totem stomp macros were removed during WotLK because pet classes broke the entire Shaman class in PVP.
---
Save your herbs now. They will sell for a lot more during raid progression.
---
I am aware of fear ward but seriously why the fuck do you care about racials if you are not playing the game competitively? Unless you are playing in the top-10 guilds in the world it doesn't matter what race you play. It's an graphical RPG game, not chess.

why would you pvp flag yourself as a level 1? oh right to contribute to the circle jerk. We all saw phase 2 being a shit show whine fest for casuals a year away. some how blizzard didn’t. just quit or suck it up for 3 more days. the tears on reddit are out of control.
---
This is how my server is too. The (always) horde players who try to claim this is "just pvp" are clowns. It's an unplayable toxic grief-fest and I originally decided to just raidlog, but after spending time playing other games I've pretty much lost any desire to play and will probably be unsubscribing. It's a shame, some of the organic wPVP battles I got into before P2 were extremely enjoyable and memorable... game is ruined.
---
Whatever you choose to play, for now I will recommend pve servers. People still flag and battle it out if you want to, but it’s not a gank storm. Even though I’m undead priest. I still help out alli (helped a guy on alli side get his benediction by talking aggro on the add spawns)
---
Upvote from an Alliance. Well played.
---
🐐
---
The 60s who needlessly kill and camp my lvl 17 alt is why I have no mercy any more
---
Don’t do tailoring and enchanting. It’s a waste of money. Do something like mining/engi if you’re into pvp or herb/alch
---
It's funny, but the only MOBA I've ever played was that mod.
---
I think you're looking for the word encryption.
---
Retail sucks balls
---
It almost certainly will, although pretty slowly.
---
Without any alliance, there's nothing to draw in wPvPers that want to play horde and people who're terrified of being camped won't roll PvP to begin with.
---
End result is that the server will be less appealing for new horde players than other servers.
---
Personally I know that I wouldn't roll horde there if I knew there were no alliance whatsoever. That's worse than rolling on a PvE server. My server (herod) still has alliance and I wouldn't roll horde here if I knew the imbalance was as bad as it currently is.
---
This is going to cause it to bleed out slightly faster than other servers will.
---
Would that mean that instead of getting trolled you get... GNOMED?
---
Community at it's finest!
---
400k? You can’t be that ignorant can you? Atleast show a source
---
this looks familiar. Which series is that pic from?
---
They can't kill you if you aren't flagged in the "green" zones.
---
As somebody who doesn't use their tablet enough, I'm taking this advice.
---
Yep  running WoW client in Linux on private server works one shot flawlessly since more than 10 years ago.  
---
But for retail I never managed to make Battle.Net / updater stuff works without fighting with wine and stuff.  
---
Never tried Lutris though.
---
You definetely go to sap and kill pet incase lock is unaware that you can sac it while sapped. Regardless its still the best way to open up that 1v1, if you are a dagger rogue you can rush down this class a bit better.
---
Ok yeah, your Utopian Ideals are missing the point, and you merely proven your point that you are in fact the one disconnected with what's going on. I'm sorry trying to make sense of you.
---
Sure, combat system isn't reworked entirely in TBC.
---
But besides that, it changes the game way more than people think.
---
It's only removed for another 3 days. Everyone who is doing this just for the honor will move to BG's. I can definitely recommend not logging in for another 3 days, but there's really no reason to unsub.
---
But as we’ve found, if enough of the population focuses hard enough on PvP, it makes the PvE content irrelevant.
---
We'll never See this. Unreal Engine is a Performance Nightmare. So it doesnt fit with Blizzard. Blizzard Always has a real Magic Touch, when it comes to Performance in their Games.
---
Only the StarCraft 2 Engine disappointed
---
So Skeram Alliance keeps playing even tho they have almost 1:4 A:H ratio. Flamelash Alliance run away when they had 1:2.
---
Thats the alliance everybody wants to see! Good job you guys, keep up the fight!
---
Congrats you showed that there’s more characters on a 15 year old server than a 3 month old server. Now show me where there’s more people currently playing retail than classic
---
Ok. Based on what?
---
Bartender especially if you play like a shaman for example who will have tons of totems.
---
Questie because it is impossible to even find most of the quests even if you could potentially do them.
---
Decurse if you are a mage or similar. 
---
Atlas Loot
---
&gt;People no longer play a race, class or faction for the sake of it. 
---
Dwarf warrior reporting in
---
This video shows people willing to kill someone who yields them no honor nor can fight back just for the sake of it. As a 60, anything under 55 doesn't even register as a threat to me so it's just interesting to see
---
So he got you to blow your blind just to kill pet. And he still has fel dom which means your efforts would be all for nothing. 😎👍
---
But I didn't get bored of the actual content, I got bored of it taking us 40+ minutes to get into the content due to being corpse camped. One day we were on our way to blackrock mountain, died for the 10th time and just decided fuck it. Literally half my play time was corpse running in the world, it just wasn't fun. If I had rolled on a PvE server I'm certain I'd still be playing now.
---
I'm sure at some point I'll finish leveling on a PvE server and enjoy the game again, but by that point a lot of people might have already quit who won't return.
---
Its noble cause. I play on Sulfuras US where the alliance are generally way more organized because horde refuse to, so honor is hard to come by, but I don't gank people under 60 unless they start shit.
---
It's like Predator, there is no sport.
---
lol I don't think you have ever played a pvp server before then. This is how it has been for 15 years. You should have known this and played PVE if you have a huge problem with being killed by the other faction. Just take the L and admit you're wrong.
---
Do much triggered horde lmao
---
I agree, but that said would love to see a game in the style of /u/imadreamwalker's artworks. They keep the style of WoW, but just much higher fidelity.
---
This is funny because it’s so demonstrably false on my own server. 
---
The top parsing raiders on the server are renowned for being ass at pvp and getting dominated outside of the time they are zerging with their guild.
---
You said more people are PLAYING retail than classic. Now show me that more people are actually PLAYING retail and not just a chart that shows how many characters are on each server
---
Best one was giving Arcane Intellect to the hunter who literally pulled 100 mobs on us in ZF through theor stupidity...
---
Sucks because I'm totally on the side of ganking and world pvp chaos.  I was excited for classic because it's basically the last of it's kind when it comes to world pvp.  The population increase and faction imbalance definitely ruined it for me though.  On my Alliance I'm always heavily outnumbered and on my Horde I'm walking around looking for scraps.
---
What is the point of this thread? Really not sure
---
Tbh BC heroics are more challenging than any dungeon in classic, which is pretty much the definition of easy. I do agree that it sucks that it makes azeroth obsolete, but in general classic is a pretty awfull game when it comes to balance, pvp and actual endgame content.
---
I mean it sounds like you got it, you're trying to do damage at that point so mortal strike, and if you have enough rage but MS is on cool down, then whirlwind
---
People are bashing the system which was totally fine and fun at the time (maybe not the r14 grind—but I dont mind that thats gated to the extremely dedicated). Its now totally understood and primed for abuse—and could use a tune-up as a result. Hindsight is 20/20.
---
Thanks to No ChAnGeS we may never see a tune-up.
---
Funneling gear is a problem with your guild not the system. If you were in a guild that denied you gear because of a duel tournament... well that’s on you.
---
The other hordes did that, I did not... I am still only lvl 52
---
For me about 1 gram per evening.
---
Definitely want 270 for both the Dreamfoil nodes.    
---
6k mana is plenty for it, I’ve been able to farm these as a means of leveling from lvl 55 (need PI+IF on every pull, but it’s always 10-11 Novas to kill each pack).
---
As a Tauren Shaman I'd say you are wrong.
---
Why would they use anything but windfury when dpsing? I mean, it'd be one thing if Rockbiter helped them do more damage, but this isn't even the case. I guess they never googled their class, can't figure out what their abilities do, and never bothered to ask the question?
---
With a level 60 and 40 ish on this server I can definitely recommend. There is a fair bit of camping at chillwind and light's hope but alliance often groups and puts a stop to it.
---
The more important question here is why you're ignoring Improved Shield Block.  You should read the Icy-veins article you linked to find out why it's mandatory for boss tanking.
---
So rockbiter is actually competitive to windfury? Interesting. Learn something new every day.
---
I’m pointing out the fact that several streamers, whose opinions were mirrored here, turned out to be completely wrong about several points.
---
Curious if anyone else is really aware that the problems PvP servers are facing literally wouldn’t exist if a few streamers had higher IQs.
---
As long as all your free time outside of work goes to WoW is doable. Especially if rankers are agreeing to a queue for r14 on your server.
---
Is it enabled from the login screen?
---
What does realm age have to do with it? I know how old many of them are. Are you saying the realm data is old? Could be, but it shows a level cap of 120.  Can you link the post to that survey?
---
I'm still looking for the penis sword
---
My guild transferred from a high pop server when the ques were 5+ hours and our pvp experience has been amazing. Our server is now full but it's not a zerg fest. Both sides are balanced and the fights have been great
---
organize costume contests.
---
Not really, you don't need it otherwise as you'd be in stunlock anyway. Plus fel dom the 15 minute cooldown that alone doesn't even make it instant? Pointless really but sure... 👍?
---
Like I said, you don't need to, can simply attack the lock and Vanish the second they Sac and just wait it out.
---
Because they are extremely powerful. An Orc with an Axe has such a large advantage over other races with axes it is like a sad joke.
---
Just like Undead in PvP or Trolls as Shamans/Mages.
---
Sure, if Player A and Player B have the exact same gear, stats, professions, and specs. 
---
But this is an MMORPG. The whole point of the game is you have thousands of players in a single world with vastly different power levels. 
---
It’s not a moba, or an arena shooter. The core gameplay loop is upgrading your character. 
---
Everything else is just fun sandbox shit to play with your upgrades.
---
Also, in practice, player A does win. Good class skill and engineering usage with bad gear will definitely dominate a bad player in good gear.
---
Yeah, this is not even remotely true. Naxx gear changes things a ton. Did you play vanilla or on private servers?
---
Also, most pvpers now are in mc gear, because it takes a couple hours a week to raid. I don't know anyone running around in just their blue bis set besides classes who dont need much from pvp.
---
Yeah of you were a gnome and flagged. You’d be dead.
---
Shadow priest here. I got the spellpower ring first in MC. I also got the trinket from a pug when I was level 56. I am always surprised at how fair loot has been handled in classic so far
---
And I didn’t reference flamelash at all? I am aware 60-40 servers are not the same as a 96-4 servers but thank you for the attempt. Got any other irrelevant comments to share or are we done here?
---
Well, the mouseover macro linked above doesn't work either :/
---
If someone could help me with that I'd be happy already.
---
Garrosh did nothing wrong
---
Thank you for the information, very helpful! I know mage is favoured for utility and for making gold, Warlock seems more fun for PVP. I might do a Mage then a Rogue later on. 
---
Thank you!
---
Personally I dinged 48 like two days before phase 2, leveled mostly in plaguelands. Sure I got ganked plenty but it certainly didn't make it impossible
---
3.0.8 was the patch that opened up the gates for good (bugs notwithstanding). Im on mobile so i cant fetch a link right now, but that should be enough to google on.
---
your video really isn't showing a difference, lol
---
While I will grant that I do see fury tanks in the top dps charts, they are typically under rogues, with true fury dps above fury tanks. The reason for this is because a fury tank, even if he doesn't use a shield, still has to limit his gear choices to almost entirely plate with maybe 1 or 2 mail/leather pieces, and a fury tank won't have Impale, since he dips into Prot for Defiance, so his dps will be lower, even though he'll have a ton more rage.
---
Check out the logs if you don't believe me. Maybe I'm reading them wrong, so if there's something I'm missing, feel free to show me.
---
Every bis that isnt MC or Ony yeh
---
Spot on.
---
Thanks a lot capitalism/lean process.
---
This same shit was happening in retail last time I checked. It was right after they introduced war mode. Turned out that nothing but horde had war mode on and if you were alliance it would take hours to finish world quests that would take 30 min to do with war mode off. You did get better rewards with war mode on, but in reality it was just basically speical horde questing mode.
---
I remember fighting with the war mode system for about  a month or so and said fuck it and quested with it off. The questing hubs were like 10x more populated with alliance. It was ridiculous, lol.
---
Opening the gates for good and slowly automated progress when where is not enough player donations is two different things.
---
It's the internet, the moment you say that human beings normally do not ingest clay and then shit perfectly shaped fire bricks you'll get someone saying that as a matter of fact, they just shat enough bricks to build a chimney.
---
&gt;All I can say is, I’m glad I rolled PvE.
---
There it is. They always find a way to fit it in.
---
So you'd rather have a quick payout to stay slightly ahead even though a better method is coming soon, and doesn't have the long term negative effects of the griefing and excessive camping?
---
SaMe thiNg HAppEns witH hORdE
---
i mean, i feel bad for killing people even as the minority faction when its obv that they have no clue what they are doing/dont put up a fight, but  that doesnt stop me from killing you once or twice a day. 
---
hell, i have been farmed by  a group of people who took turns to minmax their honor every day while fishing for the last 2 weeks
---
 if you cant handle it then play on a pve realm or a different game. you are not stuck in a bad situation with no way out, there are a lot of options. its pretty tiresome reading the same mental gymnastic from selfish nice guys who pretend that irl rules/set of values should apply here.
---
 honestly, nothing wrong with being selfish in an online game as long as you dont break any rules/tos. that freedom in games is the beauty of it. you choose want kind of character you are playing.
---
 if i want to be chained by a society which forces it stupidity on you while being exploited like cattle then i go outside. 
---
hell, most of these people arguing online about some idealistic garbage, empathy and shit, are the very same people who profit of other people being exploited when they buy whatever flashy brand product or how they fund wars with their taxes. i could go on about a lot of stuff you people are indirectly involved, but chose not to take action since it is not profitable for you, instead you go online and pretend to be a good human.
---
 reality is that most of you are lazy, uninformed hypocrits and getting ganked and camped reminds you of what kind of hopeless, useless, disposable trash you are.
---
So your problem is with cross server BGs, not the imbalance?
---
Holy shit this is beautiful tho.
---
But I love the old school feel of classic and wow in general. The cartoon feel you know. It’s a fantasy and it feels that way
---
Yeah i loved classic
---
Just feel depth run out now and phases really spread out
---
You were the one who chose to flag yourself PvP, and then you talk about safe spots in the game - how ironic.
---
Ok. Still haven’t seen anything from you guys showing otherwise. I’m not stuck on this position like you guys seem to be. Please convince me.
---
How is the fact that there are 3x the number of people allowed to login at once not an obvious problem to you? Vanilla was fine. World pvp, world bosses, and faction balance (to a far lesser extent) was fine compared to now. The world was meant to support around 2000 concurrent players across a broad spectrum of levels. Anyone who played vanilla across a few servers and factions knows that the world is far more congested as is.
---
&gt; yeah mate thats where you are wrong. nobody chooses to be outnumbered 3:1 in every "fight".
---
Re-read what I said mate. I didn’t claim you’re choosing to get 3v1’d. I said you gave up the right to choose when you signed up on a PvP server. 
---
PvE servers let you retain that right. Expecting fairness on a PvP server is just scrub mentality.

I tried to export undeads models from wow but I failed so was forced to use Sevarog model from Paragon
---
Sure, but if that idiot is sitting there *hitting the wrong buttons*, or out of order, or without the right enchants, or consumables, it really doesn’t matter does it?
---
Min/max assumes theoretical perfection at all times. Which is impossible for anyone to hit at any time.
---
So if I want to roll a NE warrior cause I like to shadowmeld out in the jungle while I go take a dump, it’s perfectly fine. And guess what? We can still down Ragnaros w/o my +5 to swords.
---
Idk, Im just gonna let the state of this subreddit speak for itself
---
Currently, raiders are not “stomping” pvpers. It’s actually the other way around, for my server at least. 
---
Allegedly Naxx gear will change that, but I don’t think Naxx will be as inaccessible as people are imagining. 
---
&gt;raiders being able to stomp pvpers without knowing how to pvp 
---
This is just fantasy really. It definitely depends on the matchup, but I.e a good naked mage could beat a warrior in bis raid gear 100% of the time if that warrior sucks.
---
It didn't work but I think I got it now:
---
/cancelform
---
/cast [@mouseover,harm] Moonfire(Rank 1)
---
Thank you btw!
---
You can pvp without camping boats, fps, safespotting in IF, and revolving groups to corpse camp the same guy for hours.
---
It was changed in wrath to open automatically *on server launch*. The gates normally opened after 3 months, and I think 9 months for 
---
servers launched post-AQ.
---
it auto progresses if minimal progress isnt made and opens eventually regardless.
---
No you didn't. You have 0 controversial comments in your post history.
---
&gt;Everyone else also stops farming honor
---
Honestly, yes, that's exactly what *should* happen. There legitimately aren't enough alliance on the server anymore for the honor to mean anything, so there's really no reason for them to do it but to be dicks. But it's far too late anyway. They failed to recognize a trend, acted shitty for that 15 honor in a 40 man raid group, drove the alliance away, and now want to cry about it.
---
Attacking me personally just makes your argument stronger...yeah...sure.
---
Go back to retail.  Sounds like that experience is more your speed.
---
there's no point to this thread
---
Meanwhile trolls get screwed from every direction.  They're the ones who were on Azeroth first.
---
Make sure you're looking in the EAST coast tab.
---
It seems to be a pretty common sentiment around here.  
---
Blame players for acting exactly as players act. As we can point out from every game released so far, UO anyone? There were dev decisions that led to this clusterfuck. Decisions they had all the information to change because very very few MMOs (0?) get such a fantastic oppo to just release their base game.
---
No changes isn't a sound argument from the devs when the entire server is on new engine and we do have changes. Just optimize your release
---
From a SL lock perspective, I just don't see how you can reliably control the fight by killing my pet. I literally never lose to rogues. Like ever.
---
Also, you try to vanish and wait out my bubble I'm just gonna hard cast another VW and force you to open. And save the 15m CD for later.
---
Go grind high warlord or grand Marshall then bro, it’s literally the most elite gear in the game.
---
Come to fairbanks alliance. We need help
---
Hopefully it gets rid of the few alliance kill squads roaming my server around DM and Strat. I don’t care if it fixes the issue for them I just care if it fixes it for me
---
Lets be honest, besides Hillsbrad pvp (lol more like 40vs40 pve) there is almost no open PvP because people rather farm their stuff in peace than be pvp flagged while their out their. And thats fine if you want that. I wouldn't.
---
Just realized I have Battle of Az and not classic installed. . .
---
Enchanting for disenchanting if you want to have another bank alt. There aren’t really any other  professions that are useful at that level
---
Not sure how many times I can tell you this. A graph that shows the number of characters created on a server is not the same as the number of active players playing the game. Retail could have 400k characters but only 1000 people playing on that server. Whereas a classic server could have 50k total characters and 10k concurrent players online. That means classic is more populated and active than retail. If you can’t grasp that simple concept then I can’t help your ignorance
---
I feel like the perception that servers are faction imbalanced  is way overblown in most cases, and it's just as detrimental  to the game as the actual imbalance on select servers. 
---
On bigglesworth for example, on our server forums there are post stating "horde are ruining the server and killing it" but two different census sites state that the ALLIANC actually have the population advantage  @ 60 (as there are.more low lvl horde than alliance).
---
Hell even in my own guild chat I see people contantly  complaining about population imbalances but again- the census sites have us near even. 
---
I dont really know what I'm getting at here but it just bothers me.
---
People cry too much and its an annoying echo camber of crys that ends up manifesting itself into existence once people start  transferring or quitting.
---
Despite your tone being a bit immature, I agree with you.
---
Although,
---
&gt;Who didnt release the population balance numbers even though it would help try to balance the server? Blizzard
---
This could have made things worse, I wouldn't list it
---
Horde is definitely the underdog on pve servers as a lot of horde players chose horde specifically pvp. Horde has better pvp racials and alliance has better pve racials. A little ridiculous to say faction A or faction B is just filled with bad players.

Ironforge is supposed to be a safe zone for a reason. Getting ambushed when you just want to bank some shit is not fun.
---
I mean you must be right, you are the gamesmaster after all.
---
What kind of realms is that :)? I hope it has a nice H / A ratio :)
---
Back in the alpha UC had a little different layout and it was very confusing. After they changed it there where 3 npcs that give you quests for Uldaman if I remember right. But they got moved to different locations and they just left hat area empty.
---
yeah and it only takes them 5 weeks of raiding to down rag
---
&gt; Low damage, but high armour
---
It was so long since I had played, I tried ten different pets between level 20 and 30. The low damage ones can't hold threat, at all. I was having to interrupt my auto shots and never attack with anything (Aimed Shot, etc) if I wanted the NPC to stay on the pet. So I concentrated on the offensive pets.
---
My favorite, hands down, is the wind serpent. It's got a decent attack speed and enough armor I don't have to heal it often before the target dies. But it's also the only pet that has a ranged attack. And that has a super nice side effect.
---
It's really, really good at pulls. So if, for example, you see 6 Murlocs around a hut or whatever and you want to pull one with any other pet, you have to take the shot yourself and then do nothing until your pet gains aggro when the NPC has run over to you. If you had just sent the boar in, all six would quickly murder your pet. So Charge is useless a lot of the time.
---
The wind serpent gets kinda close and fires off Lightning Breath at your target first thing. And for some odd reason, the other NPCs almost never aggro. It's super rare. So you send it over, it fires LB, then you let it Bite and LB the NPC a bit more to gain threat, and then you lay into it. Done and done. I trigger Aimed Shot once I see that it's hit the NPC with Growl. The only time I get aggro is if I'm attacking an NPC that's 3 or more levels higher than me.
---
It's easy mode soloing, and works just fine in dungeons. I can't really use any other pet after using the wind serpent.
---
As far as food, it's eats fish. So one a week I fish stuff up for 20 minutes. No sweat.
---
I don't know how it does in PVP since that's not really a concern for me.
---
yes, cuz i like this game and not retail
---
Maybe its everyone that did raid naxx? Lol
---
#NotAllHorde
---
When did I say people shouldn't be able to gear up? What I don't like is people who get pve rewards having a gigantic advantage over people with pvp rewards with the same time investment.
---
Tbc solved the problem with pvp rewards being better for pvp. Kind of circular logic to say "well, gearing up is part of an mmorpg" while also saying "you shouldn't be able to prevent me from pvping with your pvp gear" at the same time, which is what people who complain about resilience are doing.
---
Reroll a mage for gold farm.
---
Seriously. I got my priest to 60 first and it’s one of the worst classes to make money on
---
The big one is the tokens. It's officially supported real life money transactions at a better rate then the gold farmers can offer most of the time, if people don't think thatvaloneakes retail far more profitable they are purposely obtuse.
---
Shadowmeld cannot be underestimated on a PvP server for its multiple uses. Stoneform is best in 1v1 but is sometimes overrated as it doesn't affect all matchups and the ones it does affect are not the hardest, at least in my experience.
---
Pick whatever you want is what I'm trying to say. If you care about PvE as well as PvP nelfs are the slightly stronger choice.
---
Do you have an argument to what I said or are you also mad at horde instead of blizzard for failing to facilitate reasonable servers. You're not helping the case like the last guy for alliance being babies though.
---
What's the addon that changes the color of the frames to represent class?
---
You ask all the hybrids in the group if they need the robes - it doesn't sound like you talked about it before the run started. Don't assume anybody won't roll for something unless they explicitly say so.
---
PS, rolling Need for your offspec/raidspec like that is douchy behavior, but a lot of hybrids act that way.
---
Yeah this post is ironic. This subreddit is 80% alliance because they all left their servers.
---
This is what eventually happened to retail servers over time. A server gets a reputation as being favored to one faction. Members of that faction transfer there from other servers hoping to dominate while the other faction starts to transfer off due to the inbalance. Eventually it becomes a 80/20 or even 90/10 split, ruining pvp for all. Before warmode was introduced, just about every server was dominated by one faction.
---
how many people is "1-2%" of the original vanilla playerbase?
---
They could make it so people who want to start as alliance on this server get an immediate free level 60 character. Would probably help balance out the population.
---
Pretty much free r14 for the one alliance left though
---
Useless? It's literally the best 1 handed sword in game at the moment.

WoW Players "Wowww fuck blizzard for wcreing this up.gggggggg Fix this fix that. Reeeeeeeee
---
Yes, depriving organisms of life is definitely comparable to playing a video game. 
---
Healthy and stable comparison.

There is a white frostwolf mount coming when battlegrounds drop.  It requires exalted with the Alterac Valley rep faction.

---
Wow, a dozen bug fixes? Amazing! Thanks Blizzard!
---
It seems pretty obvious to me that Blizzard is spending as little resources as possible to support classic. Taking months to fix the few bugs that they've actually fixed, bugs that were in at launch that haven't been touched or mentioned, terrible server performance, almost no official communication about classic from Blizzard, all of the CS responses of "Sorry, this is classic, we are hands off and won't do anything" and only doing a fraction of what they did in vanilla. Not to mention all of the terrible decisions made along the way that have wrecked a lot of servers.
---
You think they want to support two versions of the same game? They would absolutely love it if everyone played retail instead of classic. Retail is much more profitable per person for them.
---
They begrudgingly support classic with the bare minimum possible, and it's pretty obvious.
---
Haha, they have never and will never force there playerbase to pick a faction cause they want to give u a choose and to develop ur char
---
But yea keep raiding around in those 40 mans playing horde buddy and telling us its blizz fault that u cant behave accordingly
---
You honestly think close to 50% of the player base will be in naxx gear. You could have just said "I'm trolling, dont reply to me" and saved me some time
---
The 2 Black lotuses I've gotten was purely out of luck when I farmed in winterspring. But I agree one the ones that'll reduce in price when AV comes out, thanks.
---
Just unsure about the black lotus, since it might have a chance of rising when bwl will come.. ?
---
But thanks alot for the hindsight mate, appreciated.
---
It's a Rogue shop.
---
They have incentivized the behavior, though.
---
Missing one of the most exciting aspect of the game due to a couple of weeks of hell? No thanks. You keep your PvE server.
---
People played for fun and discover stuff 15 years ago.  Now people are aware of the rewards and how to get them.  The game evolved with the players so we were never overloaded.  Problem is when classic came out every detail and theory has been tested for 15 years.  Classic started as it dis in vanilla but the player base didn't.
---
Ah carry along then
---
I'm not mad at anyone dude, I haven't played this game since October lmao. I'm just here for the memes, qqing, and to watch the game crash and burn.
---
Sick insult towards the alliance though man, bad ass.
---
It’s a close faction split, but there are way more horde players dedicated almost exclusively to PVP.  All in all, the sever has it’s back and forth.
---
Morgrain have a good A:H ratio. I joined that server about a week ago and meet only nice people as of now.
---
I also joined the Alliance. 
---
From what I hear the ratio is sth like 60:40 for alliance wich is very good.
---
It's a PvP realm.
---
Horde side incendius there's a casino guild that does high roll and over under 7, stuff like that. Lost some gold had fun, would play again
---
Go to a back alley and suck someone off like everyone else.
---
Yea man I definitely said they should force people to pick a faction. That is definitely the only thing they could have done months prior to address this issue. Blizzard loves it when you get mad at the horde though, keep it up.
---
That’s completely understandable! The difference is others have a choice but players wanting to play sham/pally don’t!
---
For horde you're using WW axe from 30-45 until you can get the mace from final boss in Uldaman.
---
Then if it's perfect why not roll a pve server to begin with ?
---
Nah, dead server with 80% horde.
---
does UBRS instance lock work like a raid? So it last for the week until the weekly reset?
---
Son, you make me proud
---
Not sure how many times I can ask for you to prove any actual numbers besides your speculation.
---
Your argument is retail could have X, classic could have Y, therefore classic is more populated. Got it. I guess I’m too ignorant and I’ll be on my way.
---
\&gt; Sick insult towards the alliance though man, bad ass. 
---
\&gt; being a raging horde neckbeard. 
---
Ok bud solid logic.
---
you don't even need to send gold. bags and starter equipment are enough.
---
you don't have to do daily quests in tbc; they provide alternate progression or cosmetic stuff.  wrath locked shoulder enchants behind sons of hodir which started the problem that reached its peak at the beginning of MOP
---
Hell no, that's why I don't do that. The most I've done is a duo that hunts. All I'm saying is there will be too many people who will do that to try to get slightly ahead that ruins it for everyone. All I can hope for is BG's making that not the most optimal strategy so maybe world pvp will feel like it did before phase 2.
---
So we are advocating for the same thing, except for the cross server BGs issue - which I think is largely a good thing, personally. The only difference is that I'd like to see control measures put in place and you're hoping that people will self regulate - which as we've seen is an unlikely scenario.
---
I’ve also found bots south of feathermoon stronghold in feralas and south of steemwhelde port in Tanaris.
---
But that other guy ASSURED us. With his data and evidence.
---
If you have a pally you get to use mighty rage pots instead :) tons of damage.
---
Alchemy so that you can craft your own pots. Most jobs are level gated in classic, so even enchanting may not be that useful
---
There's an add-on called Character Notes that lets you make a note for anyone without having to Friend/Ignore them. It's useful for things like this.
---
There are empty places like this in every capital city. I think Blizz wanted the cities to feel like there was room for players to set up their own shops. Like if a mage wanted to stand there and sell bread/water/portals or something.
---
They’re not fully magic immune, they take holy damage from smite and holy nova.  
---
The fire mage pulls and blinks back into the bigger room, I send void onto one of the magic immune skele’s while the priest Smites the other. While the priest is killing the 1st and finishing off the 2nd fire mage and I kill the 2 elite ghouls.
---
Yea, faction based que isnt forcing u to play alliance?
---
Fuck the players. Literally every single person is toxic.
---
This game is fun.
---
Pvp was as unbalanced as it has ever been
---
Why isnt this marked as a humor post?
---
No ubrs works the same as a normal instance
---
Except most horde are so starved for alliance blood I've seen them kill alliance trying this very thing.
---
They'd rather have bots and dead alliance
---
Flamelash only went the way it did because Blizzard opened unrestricted transfers, showing they learned nothing from the last time they did this.
---
I guess realm recruitment is competitive now, I’ll throw in 
---
-four 14 slot Runecloth Bags
---
-6 gold
---
-Greater Magic Wand (Level 13 wand) if you’re a caster
---
-3 20 stacks of WOOL cloth for First Aid if you’re melee
---
If you roll alliance on Incendius PvP
---
np bud. You rank 14 yet? Whatchu doin on reddit when you should be grinding??
---
What do you guys get out of lying?  It’s crazy lmao
---
You’re just trying to blame players for what happened while claiming some high ground of an unproven “they started it” 
---
Blizzard did this you idiots.  The sooner you realize that, the sooner they will actually respond.
---
This is pretty much how I leveled, but I did full prot leveling, here are some things I thought along the way. Going prot first has some advantages. The two big ones are the extra threat talent, which is pretty nice at any point in the game--especially since DPS dont understand threat at all, so generating more is always nice--and Last Stand, which gives you another Oh**** button on a reasonable cooldown and is very nice while leveling, where people probably dont have the best or most specialized gear. Going prot first also opens up improved revenge, which is really great in all dungeons, but especially in low level ones where a 3 second stun gives you a ton of effective HP at a point where your gear is likely junk. However, there are advantages of going with the DPS trees first. Staying with the theme of dungeon tanking, going arms first lets you pick up rage management, which is IMO a necessary warrior talent (Im having a hard time respeccing out of it even though Im in mostly BiS gear and could go for a higher threat build), and going further arms lets you pick up the 21p talent, which will let you hold AoE aggro much more easily against those casters and cleavers who (again) dont care about and dont care to understand aggro. Outside of those though, going a DPS tree is nice because, even if you plan on only going dungeon tank, at some point you will have to quest, and having some DPS talents just speeds things up--in particular, around level 50, you can spam ST, and go through that terrible zone a dozen times, or do a few quests and jump to BRD, which will get you to a high enough level to do the end game dungeons.
---
I seriously considered imp. shield block, but opted for improved blood rage + last stand as I'm still only level 56 and leveling and DPS quite a lot too.  Having the latter is universally useful and thus far I'm not tanking any serious bosses.  This will change after 60 however.
---
How about one that gave negative honor for starting a fight with a player &gt;5 lvls below you? Or for repeatedly killing one person immediately after landing from a fp or resurrectibg?
---
Ur gonna kick a .5s cast? Ok. Wanna know how my rogue fights go? Someone opens on me and I tank the opening damage until stuns wear off, as soon as I regain control I use my goblin rocket helmet on you, curse of elements, soul fire (there goes 25-40% of your HP off the bat), curse of agony because you're probably gonna vanish, death coil fear full dots shadowburn and you're basically dead or in full retreat mode. And theres literally nothing you can do about it.
---
 I've been killing 60 rogues since level 56. I have clips of me killing 60 rogue gankers in tier 1 gear, core hound tooth, perds blade and I'm not even level 60 yet. If you're on Fairbanks by chance I can show you what I mean.
---
I was using a WS on my Horde hunter until I hit 37 and replaced him with Broken Tooth. He was nice. I was hooked in by the ranged bypass-armour Lightning Breath, but found it's use as a "ranged" ability limited due to the focus and cooldown. It'd fire it once at 20yds, and then stay in melee thereafter, occasionally firing LB off. I wasn't as impressed as I had expected to be.

Like I said if you could read, I don't care about ranking. I'm only rank 3. This isn't going well for you friendo.
---
how do i do this
---
That’s because 90% of alliance consists of pussies, old people who are trash at the game, kids and weebs who wanted to play the pretty princesses. I fucking hate the alliance, but you gotta do what you gotta do to play with friends I guess
---
It's really not. You guys have been pushing the min/maxing culture for so long for a game that doesn't even matter that you've now simply played yourselves. Enjoy having no alliance to gank on the horde dominated servers.
---
&gt;No arena
---
Basically the whole game for some, half the game for others, nothing to someone else.  
---
Overall, half the game.   
---
Would never fly :p  
---
Easier to just play on a PvE server.
---
&gt;whitemane is still something like 55/45
---
Notionally. 
---
The effective Ally pop is lower than that because many have gotten tired of the constant deathball armageddon and aren't logging in. If the game is no longer fun, people don't play.
---
It would be too obvious.
---
human priest desity.  I can't remember what guilds i was in back then.
---
Lol nice quote. You're buttmad as hell, can't even type a comment properly.
---
Faction specific queues alone would have helped a lot at launch.  We are past that now with some servers dead, others dying quickly.  Blizzard will now have to take drastic action to fix this, faction queues aren't enough anymore.
---
We have battlegrounds on PvE servers. 
---
If the tag of the server is sufficient enough to let users know what kind of server you are signing up for, PvE servers would not have any battlegrounds in the future because technically speaking that is PvP content.
---
PvP servers could then potentially be confused for only having battlegrounds at some point and not these world gank squads everyone is experiencing.
---
I know the difference. I like many others played this game 15 years ago... but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have helped the general user base to define exactly what the difference between servers meant.
---
I don't really care about this whole situation I'm just saying PvP can be defined in many ways especially in Classic.
---
Death coil could crit. Later it was removed in tbc.
---
You're cringe bro, stop.
---
I just explained why this would never work. Horde wouldn't be able to logon from 8pm to 6am every day
---
According to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBPHRlgczmk) there were 895k level 60s pre-TBC, 900 guilds that killed a Naxx boss and 23 guild that cleared Naxx.
---
I tried elvui and hated it, I find SUF much more intuitive to use, and it looks much better
---
Blizzard isn't going to ban anyone for using a second account to open AQ on a single faction server.
---
How so? I show up for raids, do I not deserve a shot at loot as well? Spell power ring is one of the few items I even need from MC. There is very little loot for spriest in there. Same with Ony, I do it for the guild, literally nothing ony drops is good for me.
---
You've asked for 4 separate games within the last month from reddit. Stop begging dude, I would understand if it was just one time.
---
Edit: Sorry, it was 4 posts but for 3 games. You get the point though
---
you right.  the people number crunching and theory crafting gear as long as private servers have existed have no idea what they are doing.  if only they were better mechanically at classic wow.  mastery over 1-5 buttons is just beyond most intellect.
---
Why do you people keep fucking complaining?
---
Boars with updated charge seemed head and shoulders above everything else imo. The snap threat from charge due to gap closing and the bonus AP it provides made it very easy for them to keep threat.
---
&gt;  It is so ingrained in WoW's culture that even Blizzard thinks this way, opening mocking Alliance PvP performance at BlizzCon year after year. 
---
Why would they even do this? Sometimes i wonder what happened to Blizzard as a company.
---
&gt; Anyone got information on battlegroups? 
---
No information at all.
---
Oh I wholeheartedly agree! I like to min/max where I can and like to raid as well!
---
I don’t like people bullying others into the One True Spec™️ or the One True Racial™️ or the One True Weapon™️ or whatever.
---
It’s highly likely that you or I could outdo One True Spec™️ guy just through better, more consistent rotation than OMGWTF +5 SWORDS BRO!!!!!
---
Love the subtle humor here.  I have noticed that a lot of people in classic want to give off the aura of being a seasoned wow professional that has been called out of retirement to spread their vast knowledge of the game to the casual scum around them.
---
Except that accusing someone of picking horde for the racials is a reasonable assumption based on a clearly identifiable advantage.
---
Accusing someone of picking alliance for the racials just doesn't hold water as an argument.
---
Lol yeah but the poor little victims crying on reddit all day aren’t triggered true true
---
Lol relax man have some air you're taking it too seriously. Also, no sometimes you don't get Jokes and you're not dumb just for that.
---
I know, but the mass majority of these "Naxx experienced" players are from there. Just saying.
---
Oh hey more alliance pretending this is a horde issue and not a people issue
---
I already took the pup on his morning walk so I'm good there! 
---
You should try raging less on reddit, it would be a good use of your time :)
---
Yes many groups do it several times + reset a few times looking for jed
---
Fair point. Didn‘t think about it
---
And 90% of Horde are twitch zoomers who think they're PvP pros, it's funny how undead rogues used to be the scariest thing ever and now a majority could be mistaken for mobs.
---
You’re doing it wrong
---
Nah TBC introduced Blood Elves and a ton of self-absorbed narcissists to the Horde.
---
Cat with Bite + Growl on autocast is the best leveling pet. You can train claw too and use it manually at times if you want, but bite + growl will use most of a pet's focus so it's a minor optimization. Even at low levels cat is best, but especially once you get up to Frenzy in the BM tree at level 35+ with a 1.2 attack speed or faster cat. The most important thing a pet can do is hold aggro, and even as a BM hunter my pet regularly lost aggro until I was nearly 40 with a fast attacking cat with great Frenzy uptime. 
---
It's very important that growl be cast as often as possible and if claw is left on autocast it will often prevent growl from being used since there is a 50/50 chance of claw being used instead of growl if the pet regens enough focus to use either.
---
While leveling my hunter I experimented with owls, wind serpents, and cats. Screech is nice but focus starves the pet just like claw if on auto cast, and pets regen hp very fast when out of combat and rarely need to be mended so the superior threat of cat was preferable. Wind serpents pause for a second whenever they use lightning breath which is a DPS loss and makes them take longer to connect with the target and start using growl.
---
Boars would be good if it weren't for their 0.9 damage mod, compared to cat's 1.1 damage mod.
---
20 BOTTOMLESS BAGS AND HAND OF RAG. INCLUDING MAGES.
---
O K B O O M E R
---
I’m fine being outnumbered and ganked. It happens.
---
This isn’t that, alliance cannot even get anywhere without multiple corpse runs. It’s literally unplayable.
---
I’d say thinking your good at pvp when all you have is numbers is the scrub mentality tbh.
---
Not just one, but 7 bored perverted paladins.
---
It's a meme. I wasn't serious
---
Don’t be so dramatic lmao
---
Don’t be so sensitive bud. Grow some thick skin and own up to being wrong every once in a while like a real man
---
With guild groups or friends, yea. But pugs can be rough and I really want to make things as smooth as possible
---
Uh, classic has tons of self-absorbed narcissists already, so...
---
That’s sarcasm right?
---
Wait until you face a competent Pally in WSG, then you’ll be singing a different tune!
---
Lol the server would immediately become alliance dominated, like 95:1 if they did that. You underestimate how many people would join just for the free lvl 60
---
Im interested :)
---
you are so wrong Hoj isnt overrated even a little bit.
---
Horde just sux anyways full of spotty fat kids
---
As a warrior does anyone else notice that Sweeping Strikes tends to be a bit inconsistent in proccing. I've noticed that it doesnt seem to hit the closest target, even when I'm using it with the mobs stacked on top of each other it doesnt always proc when auto attacking or using abilities.  I read online that there may be a bug with it but I'm curious if any of you have had these issues as well.
---
Hahaha. Keep trollin dude.
---
This is the kind of people who play horde. Its always been this way.
---
what would you have someone do on a pvp server in a game that incentivizes you to kill them for a reward?  ignore them because.. in competition someone has to lose and it feels bad to lose?
---
fwiw, I think camping lowbies that dont give any kind if reward or camping someone just to upset them for no particular reason is different.
---
&gt; The culture among WoW's "hardcore" serious player community is overwhelming pro-Horde 
---
WF guild and most hardcore are alliance
---
&gt; People play the meta more than ever before, and Horde is meta for PvP 
---
no it isn't lol, vanilla meta is always alliance because of paladins
---
&gt; People like to play on the winning team. Most players want some enemy  faction, but they don't want to be outnumbered, not really. This is why  faction-based queues would never work 
---
except it HAS been proven to work on pservers, which is more evidence than your anectodal theories.
---
Right, I was going off the census data which only records if you log in within the last week. 
---
Ally had more 60's but that doesn't mean they actually play as the Horde do
---
And now your entire alliance transfered to Earthshaker, which used to be a fantastic, very balanced smaller server
---
Now every hub is Ironforge and there are people absolutely everywhere. Flamelash dying is horrible as it is, and now the shockwaves are being felt by other realms.
---
You definitely don't like Esfand
---
rend is shit and should never be used after 30
---
Then original wow was pretty fucking dead. Maybe the deadness hid the fact that wpvp is cancer.
---
This is just needlessly inflammatory and immature
---
This is what I love about the community! We need more positivity and kindness like this
---
Whitemane is not remotely Alliance majority.
---
2.9 Speed, decent proc, DPS just under Brutality Blade and you don't need to enter a raid to get it if you have money.
---
Useless.. sure.
---
Found the dude who hates every aspect of his life.
---
Well, spirit did affect *chance on hit* effects and procs at some point. The info isn't bad or wrong, it is outdated.
---
Do u play on firemaw? :)
---
Flamelash was 60/40. Thats what *caused* this.
---
Is it just because the likelihood for them to roll for something that isn't their current group role is that much higher? You'd rather just not let them at all?
---
*Optional* daily quests. They weren't mandatory like future xpac dailies that were needed to actually progress...
---
Y O U R METH A S S MO M S u K S M Y N U T S
---
I'm fine with arena, but yes remove flying and dailies.
---
Wow... lol.
---
Yo be careful, one reddit post with 100 upvotes could easily get thousands of views lmao. Don't want you to break the bank.
---
I am not going to follow them around to film them.  If you want to go find them.  Go to the elementals in the South west part of the zone, I am sure you will see at least 4.
---
Earthfury is also majorly Alliance dominated
---
In actuality, it was to prevent people levelling safely, getting overgeared in pve realms, then transfer to pvp realms and be top dog
---
It was honestly a better version of vanilla in most cases.
---
Just goes to show what passionate devs and managers can accomplish with vanilla.
---
Yeah all those "alliance do X", "horde do Y". Even if the balance is skewed, a large proportion of players are casual enough and just pick a race which looks the best for them
---
I'd appreciate this dude more if he wasn't such a db
---
The most tryhard Vanilla guild APES are Alliance.
---
Imagine thinking you're playing the inferior pvp faction when you have dwarf priests and holy paladins
---
Yeah, experience bonus and free mounts would bring a lot of people to the minority faction.
---
Pretty much. Ever since I saw the "leveling through previous expansions" that they are doing for Shadowlands, I've lost all hope of Classic+ or BC after Naxx.
---
Noone with even the slightest knowledge of classic said that raids would be hard. I can't think of a streamer that I watch that said it. The only content creators that I can think of that said it is Hamsterwheel or maybe TipsOut, and for TipsOut, I bet even turning on the computer can seem like a daunting task. When you're making an absurd claim that doesn't seem to be true at all, you really gotta give names. Asmon, Soda, Esfand, staysafe, preach, payo and all the pserver streamers had said that raids were easy, I don't know what you're on about.
---
I was totally immersed in a world where I could fly. To each their own I guess...
---
I cant believe I´m saying this as an avid classic player.
---
Unless something new and really ingenious noone has yet thought of can be implemented very soon (before more servers are crippled like Flamelash) - I can only think of one thing that will prevent me from rerolling pve or just quitting the game I love. To make it possible to unflag for pvp like in (trembling) retail.
---
I´m on Mograine EU as the majority of old guildies of our vanilla guild voted for pvp - little did we know what was going to happen.
---
Only been raidlogging since honor was introduced and the full effect of the catastrophe was clear to me.
---
I'll do what I can, but obviously my funds aren't endless.
---
Its obvious if you just look at what posts get upvoted.
---
Meh. My realm started as close to 50 50 as possible.
---
Horde leveled faster and during the first wave of transfers alliance fled the server. Now we are very horde dominant 
---
Yes I do see that as horde winning on this realm. Shitty it will become more and more skewed over time;but at least the allies left are organized and good players.
---
If you abandoned your realm when it was 55-45 or 60-40 you're part of the true reason realms are getting fucked.
---
Player gets mass reported. Blizzard investigates and decides on a course of action.
---
vs
---
Player gets mass reported. The system automatically hands out some punishment.
---
=
---
IMO these are very different cases. Obviously mass report into auto punishment is not a suitable bot detection method. But if a player gets mass reported for "cheating" then it should warrant at least a cursory glance by a real human working for blizzard.
---
Players choose the realms they play on and then regret their choices when it's not what they want. That's not Blizzard's fault.
---
&gt;*The fact that the server was 70/30 before world pvp*
---
Not a fact, just a guess (probably an over-exaggerated one at that)...
---
First of all, fuck TBC. Lets pray it doesn't happen.
---
And I am 100% sure that TBC arena meta is completely set in stone one day 1 throughout the entire expac if blizz were to head that way, and people would lvl up the ideal classes for that before the game even launched.
---
Like they will do with Orc hunters for PvE.
---
and as usual, people who says "I remember playing in vanilla... (or TBC) and this is how we did it " will basically always be completely wrong, just as they have been with classic so far. The experiences from 2005 or 2007  is basically irrelevant at this point, since the game is completely figured out.
---
you need at minimum 100 people with 15 hk to open ONE bracket 1 slot. There's only 43 alliance left on that server, they'll never get it now unless they all make 1.5 alts with 15 hks too
---
And again, faction balance has absolutely nothing to do with a flawed world-pvp system. Stop blaming something random.
---
Ironforge.pro is more reliable for gauging ratios. Ever notice how a lot of realms have double digit % swings on Classicpopulation? 
---
I imagine in Whitemanes case it comes from not picking up SMOrc since they don't play at NA peak times.
---
I’d use all that free time to get a job.
---
Yes but you're talking as if several people with lots of influence said it, when infact it was 2 at the time barely relevant people and Hamsterwheel being known for being a hypocrite and TipsOut for being $500K in debt after attemting a construction fraud with his dads company for millions of dollars. I don't know why you would ever care to value their opinions.
---
Heartstriker EU is no better. 85% Alliance ...its a mess
---
&gt;*no one will play the game with you any more*
---
One server is not reflective of the entire game. There are plenty of people out there enjoying the game and the PvP it facilitates.
---
Pserver though they are stuck with the one server.  In Classic they could just hop to a more preferred realm.
---
If Blizzard  did something like this, everybody would go "omg, so great" and it would be accepted as the new look of WoW.
---
Exactly. And if u dare suggest you just play the game for fun you called an idiot for not trying to have the biggest numbers. It's like... Games used to be games... When did people start treating them like jobs??? It's like actually just playing the game to have fun isn't even an option to these people. Really unhealthy and sad mentality
---
Those people are the exact fools I'm rallying against. Make this kind of behavior socially unacceptable by interfering however you can
---
When you get bloodthirst/mortal strike, you need to save your auto attacks for generating rage, HS just makes your auto attacks dump rage instead resulting in less overall damage potential
---
paladins are so much better as a healer that they outweight any racial in group pvp.
---
alliance will win every bg if they are similar skilled to their horde counterpart.
---
Even if they can do that no problem they still have to do 2X the resources. How come no one brings that up when this "solution" is brought up?
---
Afaik nothing can overrule the green weapon glow. Just like any other weapon with a "stock" glow on it

There could be 100,000 people on a server, but only 5,000 playing at one time.
---
*Show us where the red team touched you...*
---
Bruh.. the mines of Moria.
---
Thanks!
---
Daily’s ruined the experience for me. Turned wow into a chore. When bg’s come out I will be totally content, right now I’m just enjoying playing a pally alt (a class I’ve never played).
---
You're locked out of literally everything except for Fire totems by a Counterspell. From my experience, you cannot beat a Mage without getting a LB+Purge opener on them. Also Grounding Totem is broken so don't ever count on that to help you. It can absorb two Polymorphs in a row then fail on the third one.
---
It’s actually hard as heck to clear the boats bc you have to constantly keep a raid there. They Rez on the boat, so it’s just over and over. Alliance can take it over once, but then they have to stay there to get the horde to not just keep camping it. And I’m on benediction where a particular horde streamer with hand of rag doesn’t have a job and lives with his mama, so he has all the time to sit there.
---
imagine playing the game as it’s intended 😂
---
Cool, thanks
---
Damn, these victim complexes are still going strong.

everyone left?

Whitemane 57.6/42.4 Horde favor.
---
That's great, how long did this take ?
---
Nope
---
I'm rely curious why nature's swiftness makes an elemental shaman any good in pvp, like, I get one big heal that's maybe 2k health, then I get to what? Frost and flame shock the rogue to death? If I can reliable bait the kick, trinket or consume out of the three (or is it four) things rogue have that interrupt casts I can get one normal cast off per fight?
---
who the fuck cares about whether they're assholes? the question is how we solve the problem. 
---
do we 1. complain about bankers or 
---
2. create a system that disincentivizes risky bank loans
---
?
---
This guys been RP’ing for a decade and didn’t even know it
---
Oh did you not know how honor works when you chose PvP?
---
Cuz PvE servers have a good amount of PvP too, you just get to choose the "conditions" you want to PvP in. Seems more along the lines of what you would want
---
You sure you aren't just looking in the mirror?
---
Alliance aren't struggling to farm honor, there's an endless supply of honor literally everywhere. We're struggling to farm anything else.
---
Thank you for this answer! I don't have stance mastery atm but plan to start getting it in the next few lvls since I'm pretty much done with the fury tree. Haven't really used shield block + revenge combo yet so I'll definitely try that out.
---
But if I understand it right, using battle shout generates threat because it's a buff to your party, and it's not shared among targets like demo shout. So I guess spamming battle shout continues to generate threat, no? But the shield block + revenge combo generates more threat per rage point?
---
I followed this same logic, but I regret not rolling an orc rogue. Yes, they're much too bulky for rogue but blood fury and 25% stun res sounds so good
---
This is why I play on a pve server.
---
Plot twist, OP is horde trying to draw in alliance.
---
As a wise man once said, https://i.imgur.com/LaJ9Kmo.gif
---
Did they migrate from their server to reddit? What was that even supposed to mean?
---
Going deep prot isn't worth it until level 55 or 60. Arms is without a doubt the best leveling spec and you're very able to switch to sword and shield to tank a dungeon.
---
As a warrior with both, I'm so happy I got mount first. Just pick up Mask of the Unforgiving in the meanwhile. It's a big upgrade but the qol epic mount gives you is just insane imo.
---
TBC is the least likely expansion to have an established day 1 meta. It's the only expansion without a private server scene and, thus, lacks the decade of theorycrafting every other expansion has.
---
And then they'd try to find more balanced server, or people would reroll Alliance, or whatever would happen to even out populations. Yes it's drastic. Yes it's needed if the game is going to survive long term. Sorry that it hurts your faction more than it hurts Alliance. The survival of the game as a whole is more important than any individual
---
is there a good EU Noggenfogger social levelling guild? I'm 36 and bored as hell with solo. Horde btw, don't mention swockwickdus.
---
Yeah, on face value windfury is a more potent weapon buff to have, however the rng nature of the proc makes it less useful. A lot of the time, it will proc when a mob is almost dead, leading to overkill damage, which is wasted damage. If it proc’d when a mob was at 100% health every time, it would no question be the stronger option. 
---
It’s the same reason why for healers, healing power is generally favored over spell Crit %. It’s cool when heals crit, but the unpredictability of it makes it not very useful, since you can’t risk the tank getting too low hoping for a crit, and a crit when he is medium/high health will just overheal him which, again, is wasted healing/mana.
---
I could say the same about your reply. Get bent ya tosser and find something to be happy about.
---
There is nothing worth with that that's true, but you should then just play something where you can get some fun and progress in those 30min, like lol or dota.
---
I also don't see this as being elitist. In fact I'd say it's the people who want to change the entire game and the genre to suit their time requirements, who are really the duchess here. This is how the game was and the fact you needed other people to progress made it a lot more fun, then just grinding WQs.
---
compared to the macho alphas who play as orcs bc they're super fuckin cool and edgy??
---
lmao just let people play who they like
---
Bought out by Activision duh
---
I watched a bot farming turtles on the Hinterlands coast hit 60 over a week of honor farming, so nice to see the lil guy all grown up
---
It wasn't at the time when it was posted originally, though?
---
Downvoted for speaking the truth. Classic leddit.
---
every other comment is basically "FUCKIN PUSSY ASS BTICH ALLIANCE &gt;:(((( i hate gnome"
---
Hard disagree. Players have turned pvp into garbage. It used to be fun but now everyone is obsessed with being #1 and min maxing and being super mega efficient at the cost of actually just fucking playing the game.
---
You can't tell me horde players are actually having fun camping the same spot for 5 hours killing like 2 lvl 48 alliance and getting like 10 honour between them.
---
Maybe, just maybe, people should stop with min max culture and idk... Just have fun????
---
Think that's where the barbershop ended up
---
Idk man Trolls/Undead are pretty lean and Orcs/Tauren are beefcakes.
---
lmao the irony is lost on you with this reply!
---
Ill invite you as horde on Stonespine EU that is roughly 25% alliance, yet they are all hardcore PvP'ers filling most high ranks, camping zeppelings 24/7. 5 man groups roaming everywhere. LHC on constant lockdown.
---
The fact that you guys, anecdotally, assume that this doesn't happen either way is just beyond my comprehension of whiny babies. 
---
But hey, that's part of rolling on a pvp server. At times it takes away some enjoyment from the game, but it will always be better than to listen to crying alliance on this subreddit.
---
Edit: Pissy alliance already downvoting because their whole narrative of being the sad, mistreated, race on WoW is being shut down.
---
&gt;muh anecdotes.
---
That's kinda on them for inviting him though, isn't it? Why would he go if he can't roll on loot?
---
You did it solo in the grave yard?
---
That's just proving the point of my post.
---
and dont even get me started on orc's passive stun resist. Lotta micromanagement on that one
---
Seems everyone had different experiences. I went full BM for leveling.  With that extra pet damage I rarely had threat issues, and if I did there was always the taunt/stun from BM tree.  Boar was my preferred pet solely because of charge and how that quickly got me into combat. Over the course of 50 levels it saved me a lot of time.
---
I misread. I missed the part about a new server. I thought you meant switch to the losing side on your own server.
---
My bad.
---
There wasn't though mate.
---
ROFL .... Imagine thinking that was a waste of time
---
You'd be surprised. Last night a bunch of mages were still shooting frostbolts at Onyxia while she landed, and got wrecked by her.
---
I haven't seen this much salt online since November of 2016. Delicious.
---
I understand who you're grinding, but that's the game.  That's who you have to kill to advance and progress.  To expect players not to play the game is unrealistic.
---
And if you are camping people for hours on end you are not getting any honor from them by the fourth or fifth kill.  Those people are just assholes in their own right, not because of how the system is designed.
---
I don't think they would be doing it if they were not having fun. They really enjoy when people get mad like this thread. I think some people are too soft for the game apparently because even if the server's were balanced they would be upset about being corpse camped.
---
Yeah mate. COC kiting.
---
I play on Kirtonos and it is the same way. Horde tend to usually dominate BRM but alliance seem to have greater numbers in all other neutral zones such as wpl. Good luck getting to Strat in less than 30 minutes
---
You think you want it, but you don’t really.
---
People who complain about Blizzard not fixing faction imbalance are of a sheep mentality, right out of Black Mirror episode. "Control us, restrain us, force us, if you don't, it's your fault".
---
The sunk coat falesy
---
Activision happened
---
Good example of the exact type of person I'm talking about, yes.
---
&gt;"problems exist? THIS OBVIOUSLY MEANS THEY'RE SPENDING AS LITTLE RESOURCES AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S OBVIOUS!!!!!"
---
If you're not raiding a lot just go PvP spec, current spec looks fucking whack. The rogue discord have listed some good meta specs that won't fail you, you can find the discord on Wowhead.
---
Well it's the double whammy of horde having better racials AND having cooler races.
---
faction change is kind of complicated in classic because horde and alliance attunements and quests / rewards are asymmetric... I suppose they could get around that but it would be a big argument over whether people get the "faction equivalent" or they lose all faction specific stuff and have to do the other faction quests afters they transfer
---
Your acting like their videos don’t have tens of thousands of views.
---
Just because you don’t drink the kool-aid, doesn’t mean everyone else doesn’t.
---
Tips is actually fairly relevant. Despite being a conman.
---
Pservers are closer to classic than vanilla is tbh. Classic =/= vanilla
---
im not herbalism spec, but im going for a twink to do it so which one should i keep an eye on?
---
Well we have already seen the problems that P2 has brought to populated servers. We know that player cap is quite much bigger than what it was in Vanilla. I am pretty sure that for quite long fishing event is pretty huge clusterf\*ck. There will be thousands of players trying to get that first place.
---
I think OP did a good job, but  this guy manage to keep a lot of the charm/wow - feeling:

Would love to play this some time in the futre like a WoW 2 VR vertion or something.

Classic was credited for having the largest quarterly sub increase since WoD.
---
That is not "small to non-profitable".
---
"Alliance would never"
---
Ok
---
Source?
---
Lol, r/classicwow where you ask to back up your bullshit and get downvoted, clowns.
---
People misflair their posts on purpose since that's not a bannable offense. Every other vent/gripe post is flaired as "discussion" or "media".
---
Need at least 500 people getting honor or something
---
for real?
---
One-factioned servers have been existing for a very very long time. I have played on one and I was fine.
---
2/2 sinister strike is standard for dagger in PvP. Sometimes you simply can't backstab, and having cheaper sinister strikes is more valuable than 2% dodge. Hemo is useless for daggers.
---
Elemental mastery and natures swiftness.
---
Your logic for #3 is flawed. People already know server population ratios. Introducing faction queue creates an added cost to play the dominant faction. All things equal, introducing a cost will disincentivize the associated behavior.
---
Whoops, I just invented a new thought experiment.
---
pvp to pvp is allowed, he wouldn't be able to transfer to an rp realm but rppvp yes.
---
Look at classic wow logs. Alliance are dominating MC speed clears.
---
Freedom, cleanses not just purge, best single target heals, BoP. Don’t be so obtuse.
---
We're all talking about phase 1 but sure
---
For the bored!
---
Wow a single guild in an entire game, you certainly invalidated his point.
---
All I can say is that my giantstalker shoulders and worg are twice as big as my nelf guildies when we raid. No regrets.
---
Not in phase 1
---
If I pick up Gnomish Engineering and drop it to re-level engi and take Goblin, which gnomish items will I no longer be able to use? I Know you can still use most of the trinkets and stuff that you already crafted does anyone have a list of items that are Gnomish only and that are not able to be used after switching?

The balls and shaft are a 5 paladin multiboxer, then people added a tip

---
Not everyone’s a shithead to other players
---
You would be spending far more time each week trying to farm the gold for that than to do a weekly 2 hrs mc run for a few weeks. Very sure
---
Why would Blizzard make certain classes available for several races if they were intended for only one race?
---
Faction ballance can be fixed (mostly) just not by Blizzard. We need more players investing in the levelers. Instead of raid logging or siting in the capital players could activly try to make the leveling experience easier for players new to the server. Hand out bags, gank the gankers ect. End the defeatist attitude and make a difference. This is a community game so invest in it.
---
People cannot play the game so they go to forums complaining how they cannot play the game, happened before you were born.
---
it has nothing to do with that... the first few weeks my server was almost dead 50-50 alliance-horde, after they opened up the transfers to heartseeker a bunch of big alliance guilds left, while barely any horde guilds left (this was just random chance as pvp wasnt even big yet), after pvp came out and the horde started rolling over everyone the effect compounded itself and more alliance left leaving only a handful of alliance guilds and a 4-1 server ratio...
---
From what I understand on heartseeker (the server where all the alliance went to) its the exact opposite problem and there are barely any horde.
---
Shitty meme made even worse with a non-Classicwow picture.
---
Create a guild there called Red Book of Azeroth, all alliance join
---
Ok wait but you are changing the topic in question now. My original comment was to argue that blizzard is not solely responsible for the blame. The players are too. If the topic is how do we fix it then I absolutely agree that it’s all in blizzard’s hands. In the same way that it was the government’s responsibility to fix the banking fiasco. Who shares blame and who has responsibility to fix is different. In a bank robbery, the police have the responsibility to fix the situation, but they are not to blame for the situation existing. Capeesh?
---
Thats not true. I've always played alliance. The whole alliance are this, and horde are that is a silly argument, and very tribal.
---
When you introduce a system that is literally impossible to progress in without griefing other players yes, its their fault
---
I just don't buy it. They literally do nothing but sit around and then insta kill some lower level players and then have to wait another 15 mins for other players to show up. That's not fun for anyone. Plenty of horde players on this sub alone have said it becomes draining and dull so why not just stop?
---
And this isn't just with WoW either, across the entire gaming world is this strange phenomenon where people force themselves to play games and be tryhards when they don't want to. I find it very very weird.
---
WoW is defs one of the biggest games suffering from this mentality - I mean just look at the retail wow sub during all of bfa - hundreds of thousands of people complaining and saying how much they hate the game etc... And if u say "how come you don't stop playing then?" they can't even come up with an answer they just get mad.
---
Gaming culture has become so toxic and nasty over the years it's really sad. I think a huge part of it is streamer culture as well: ppl see these ppl getting thousand and millions of views and tons of money by playing non stop to the point where they have to shit and piss themselves in a diaper and so many people are like "wow that's cool that's awesome" and want to emulate that try hard epic gamer skill lmfao
---
I already have a pork missile but my wife doesn't like it very much :(
---
The exploitation of the first one would not be as bad as the current situation is. Are you expecting hordes of lvl 54s to be out there griefing 60s? And btw they can't start the combat. C'mon man.
---
Yeah sure they should make pala attacks work on them and they will be real dead baddies
---
Was the opposite on RP shards
---
Dude are you for real????? 
---
nochanges ment regarding the mother fucking gameplay. Wtf is wrong you? Basic quality of life issues like pop imbalance ARE NOT ON THE GODDAMN PLATE.
---
Never were, never will.
---
Sheesh. Unreal. Pure and simple mind blowing.
---
Fire elementals in Arathi maybe?
---
Most people probably don't realize it, but the due to the pop increases the materials for war effort will be a joke 
---
AQ war effort will be completed in under 24 hrs, on most servers, if not all.
---
Might be an issue for the smallest servers with a dead faction but like i pointed out they know its coming they have months to buy up mats that are being farmed at rates far exceeding old classic plus each faction has different mats so its not like they need 24k thorium for both factions just for the alliance and then horde require Mithril Bar instead
---
That’s active raiders, not players. So if people aren’t parsing their raids they won’t show up on that list.
---
Don't bother with sunk cost. 
---
If you want to play classic, pick a different server. If you don't want to play wow anymore, then cancel.
---
Don't forget about those naive players that rolled on PvP and  now are *begging* for paid transfers
---
What a fucking joke
---
The Western part of that empire was called Horde
---
I'm sorry, I responded to the wrong comment. Bc dungeons were the best.
---
God forbid we don't have to log on daily to keep up with a video game like it's a job 
---
What happened to playing because you want to play? Fuck off with this carrot on a stick shit
---
Wdym?
---
Well, damn. Better get those 80% Alliance and have them populate some servers for a better overall balance, then. Might help if they hopped into the game instead of spending their time in the forums that happened before I was supposedly conceived and birthed.
---
They would stand in the middle of raids with 60s and die to aoe.
---
&gt;It's the only expansion without a private server scene and, thus, lacks the decade of theorycrafting every other expansion has.
---
Thats not true, there have been initially very succesful TBC servers, especally Netherwing which is still up.  And I can guarantee you that people on there know exactly what to do. Hence there being like a fucking stupid amount of orc hunters, and a shitton of PvP druids.
---
And its usually the same story on all TBC servers, people love the first few months (which starts at lvl 1 btw, if its a serious server to not fuck the economy) they enjoy the game for a while, roflstomp all tier 4/5 content and then quit.
---
PvP also more or less dies out eventually since Alliance isn't a faction in TBC, and the servers just can't maintain their playerbase.
---
Its odd really, that TBC is just the black sheep of "classic" trilogy, where even WotlK is super succesful, while TBC has barely had lonh term success. I think its in big part due to the how the expansion is designed. 
---
It does not have the world aspect of classic, and it does not have the "perfect" casual tone of wotlk (which is also the preferred PvP expansion).
---
Obviously ppl will still blame Corecraft, but again. There have been exceptional TBC servers and they have all shown their cracks.
---
I'd love daily quests in Classic, would give people a reason to log on outside of raids and leveling alts
---
I mean be honest, what is there really to do once you have all pre-raid BIS items and everything else maxed out? Raid and alts, that is it.
---
At the very least Arena should be truly FFA when it comes to teams.
---
BFA does also give lore reasons for folks not to be so loyal to their factions.
---
I wouldn't mind, it's barely an upgrade over Robe of the Void. We are prioritizing ours to paladins.
---
edit: y'all need some sims guys, the difference is like 2-3 dps and pallies will wear the robe until phase 5
---
4h t3 gearcheck against luck and it's cleared. I am going to be very impressed if it's not down the week it's released in Classic.
---
Cry more...
---
And I do blame those who only have 40 minutes to play yet picked a pvp server. That server type is not for them, and its not acceptable to let that type of player make statemetns against those what did roll on the correct server type.
---
Its very narcissistic to join a book club, then start demanding that everyone starts cooking instead of reading.
---
And you're talking A LOT of time :P
---
Hope you’re human or you have 1 more item to get!
---
Wasn't even appearing as an option there
---
Problem's solved now anyway, I got it via twitch
---
Only a few games can pull this off. Team fortress 2 has that timeless art style that still looks really good. The characters have so many emotes and personality that it makes that game feel alive. I think that the animations are what really make a game special, like how each race in WoW has different spell cast animations as well as emotes and voice lines
---
It just looks like you run through one part of the dungeon that's considered a "whole" dungeon just like in SM. People would prefer if the entire HFC or CFR hub was one dungeon, even though the end result would be exactly the same.
---
Its like Syria. When people are getting murdered left and right, they tend to flee. Earthshaker is now a massive refugee camp.
---
We have 3 PvP Servers in Germany and those turned to PvE overnight as well. Not as bad as Flamelash but still PvE. I cancelled my sub. Im so fkn sad
---
The fact that 3/4 of the server would rather be choked in queues rather than play Alliance says a lot
---
I remember most people were not going to grind high warlord because classic was on the way
---
15% more white damage on average and an extra 3% hit is a lot to overcome.
---
Idc about it. I just want the gear
---
Badges weren’t in BC heroics until the end though
---
And then they gave Alliance huge rewards for wpvp with it on and they started doing the exact same thing they complained that the horde were doing. So both factions started doing it in different phases.
---
Ranking up at the expense of exterminating the other faction entirely isn’t even in their own self interest in the long run.Even animals in nature eventually find a balance between predators and prey.
---
I played them a little, and 100% disagree.
---
As someone who played in classic(didn't even hit 60 but had about 6 lvl 40-50s) I can tell you first hand people were just as toxic back then.
---
Absolutely no idea where people are getting this idea from
---
Wing buffet is a partial threat drop.
---
Is this really so bad on other servers? Im on Stonespine and i feel like it's the alliance doing all the kill squadding on low levels. I just reached the 50-60 level spurt, and i can't live for 10 minutes without a group of 60 is ganking me or a rogue/druid is corpse camping me, i guess im biased since i literally can't see it from ally perspective on my server tho. This playstyle feels horribly greify and toxic tho.
---
It was almost 50/50 before p2. Pretty balanced
---
How it is in elementary school? 
---
You didn’t prove anything and certainly didn’t prove me wrong. It’s all speculation, so the fact that you can just tell me I’m wrong, offer nothing in return, while being so dogmatic about it is hilarious and sounds like an argument my 4 year old would have.
---
Ruin?! We just started! 
---
No place will be safe for you, so try in hide in your little iron forge ( which is like 80% of you guys ).
---
For extra bonus points, get the bots to low health (sub 30% I think?) so they'll use a potion before they die.
---
Sunder is better, especially since you will bait out a dodge with it.
---
Ever heard of the warrior discord?
---
Download easyframes. Lots of options for classicon, classcolor, custom text for hp and mana etc
---
westfall is pve? didn't know that. I was just going by the top two servers on this list for each faction.  https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
of course my transfer case would be pvp to pvp servers, I wouldn't force people onto a pvp or pve server
---
The long dick of the light
---
You didn't have to do them......
---
Time to make 20 alts
---
This is the entire issue right here. Everyone keeps trying make it sound like this issue was unavoidable but it totally was. All players had to do was not treat WPVP like a "biggest asshole on the server" competition by camping every single flight point, graveyard and neutral city. The best part of all this is horde was saying up until recently that it wouldn't matter how bad the server splits were because battle groups would solve the queue issues. Well if they empty out a few more servers worth of alliance players battle groups won't be able to compensate for that and its going to be hysterical watching them complain about long wait times.
---
That was me a week ago, such a sick piece of gear. BiS for all of classic except for a slight upgrade from naxx I believe.
---
He doesn't.  If you are going to die anyway- a friendly enemy will kill you instead of letting the mobs do it.  A jackass will watch you die and take the mobs while also making you pay for repair costs of dying in pve.
---
I want TBC content tuned to 60, like Karazhan.
---
The only gripe I have about WoW progression developments are how they built this huge game, then invalidated all of it with the subsequent expansion. Most of Kalimdor and EK were completely dead zones during BC.
---
Walk around classic now, the starting areas are totally cleared out, even with 10x server pops. Can you imagine what shatt city would be like or any of those smaller Outland zones would be like with 10x server pops? It would be a total nightmare. 
---
If they continue the classic trend, they need to do whatever they can to keep a large percent of the game viable. The original BC took a huge world and made most of it pointless or only temporarily valid while grinding levels.
---
In the very short term they are gaining more honor points. In the long term they are going to be on a pvp server with only one faction because they bullied the other side into extinction.
---
The rotations are so simplistic that the main drivers are the one true X that you are referring to. 
---
Take rogue for instance, as combat spec, you sinister strike, slice and dice and just maintain slice and dice while sinister striking on cool down basically (timing after white mh swing for maximum efficiency) occasionally dumping 5cp into an evis if the fight even lasts that long. because the rotation is so easy, your damage can almost be predetermined before the fight starts based on your race and gear. 
---
This is what min/maxing is. Not everyone has to do it, but since the information is so readily available, many people go down this route.
---
Catching up is basically irrelevant unless you have some bet with your friend that you’ll get rank 14 first. And that’s still even more irrelevant unless the people in front can continue to perform and grind. 
---
If I’m rank 1 now and start grinding bg’s on the 10th and get bracket 1 every week from now until I’m rank 14; and random shadow priest who thinks he’s a raid challenging god because he’s rank 7 after grinding lowbies in searing gorge for the past month 18 hours a day, gets like 14th every week; than it legit doesn’t fucking matter what that shadow priest does. Because he’ll eventually hit like rank 10-11ish and get fucked by decay and will never hit rank 14. And I’ll eventually surpass him because I’m getting bracket 1 every week. All his time, honor, and grinding will have been for fucking nothing. Because that’s how oppressive the honor system is. 
---
The only people that grinded world PvP honor for rank either know for the a fact that they have a solid premade ready to grind when bg’s drop, or are complete fucking morons that’s have no idea how this honor system works. I truly feel bad for the latter who wasted their time. And look forward to all the posts in 1-2 months about how bullshit the honor system is and how fucked all these people are getting despite grinding 18 hours a day in winterspring for weeks.

That’s why those of us that did the grind in the past are sitting here with near second hand embarrassment baffled as to why people have been farming round the clock for rank 5 in felwood and shit. It’s really upsetting that many people are going to be desperately disappointed when they realize there’s essentially no such thing as being “on curve” and that they worked their asses off for ranks that level 29 rogues are gonna be getting in wsg playing just for funzies.
---
Uh as someone who started and lvld in vanilla pvp server people where still dicks back then.
---
someone ought to fix that in the next patch 15 years ago
---
Step one cooking
---
Step two put down camp fire
---
Step three ???
---
Step four profit
---
No one ever said that.
---
What we (all) said is that around 1% cleared Naxx in Vanilla.
---
Huge difference.
---
Kick I’d say. Did he ninja loot from guildies or pugs? 
---
Either way not cool
---
any hardcore pvper have been 60 way before phase 2 released
---
Fuck Resilience.
---
Fuck dailies.
---
Fuck a city where alliance and horde are neutral.
---
Fuck flying mounts.
---
Fuck a linear questing story.
---
Fuck taking away unique classes.
---
Fuck 30% nerf so everyone can see content despite not earning it.
---
Fuck normal/heroic versions of anything.
---
Fuck tokens for gear.
---
Didn’t mind those female blood elves though. They can come back.
---
I'd say gkick cause he'll probably end up leaving or not showing up for raids knowing he won't get shit
---
Loot banned until AQ40 - they'll leave the guild on their own 😁
---
I met some great players on Nostalrius because we all felt really lucky to be able to replay this great game. 
---
Also met some real fucking assholes too. 
---
Same old same old.
---
So WoW classic servers no longer are layered. Which means they each have a total limit of players in the game world as well as the login server. Look at how many retail servers still say full/High versus WoW classic servers. You will get your answer. Each classic sever is limited to 5k players at full with a queue.
---
Edgemasters is my guess?
---
Ask him privately which punishment he would prefer and then ask for a suitable ‘donation’ to vote for that outcome.
---
Buddy. Anybody who learns a second language appreciates pointers when they get something wrong. That's what's happening here. Chill b
---
Yep. While Horde plays Five Finger Death Punch.
---
I'm actually not hating it, plus my friends rolled on pvp so i followed. But thank you for the offer.
---
Lol he is talking about edgemasters handguards.
---
Grats on double binding, i have the baron binding and like 30 bars right now, still w8ing for the other one to drop
---
I’m going outside the realm of suggestion with mine but ever since I could tame one I suggest Gorillas. They have immense armor; slow attack speed (2.0), and an AoE thunderstomp. If you’re BM leveling you rarely get aggro off of em unless you nuke your target. With thunderstomp doing near 100 damage. I’ve had a gorilla since I could from STV. Easily my best experience for survival in the open world. Stats may be a downside but I feel the benefits of AoE outweigh other pets threats issues.
---
Hey there :)
---
I think that’s because there is leftover aggro from P2 when only range are hitting her
---
World enlarger is one, the teleport to gadget are the 2 I can think of
---
You'd think after watching CCP almost suicide the server numbers with their attempt at forcing some players to be farmable content for others with the "Chaos Era" that Blizzard would at least avoid some of those mistakes.
---
Lol, thats nuts! I guess there can only be so many combinations of letters right?
---
Yeah, it's just very powerful. I say it's badly itemized because the swing timer is very unexciting, it's almost impossible to hit something and then have it survive the next 30 seconds to get full value out of the proc, and it has no stats whatsoever... that said, it's a very powerful weapon that is well worth trying for.
---
what kind of messed up person can enjoy doing 500 arena runs for sgc?
---
what kind of messed up person can enjoy looping around a zone picking plants for hours?
---
what kind of messed up person can enjoy farming gold at zf?
---
honor is currency that you use to get gear upgrades for raiding and pvp, just like any other farm in the game. only difference is that you are not killing NPCs this time.
---
i play mostly horde, but have played alliance. all these assholes are the exact same they just fancy different branding. I havent even played since like a week before phase2 dropped. Im just waiting for battlegrounds.
---
This is what annoys me about the "no changes" crowd.
---
There have literally been tons of changes.
---
It's not better. Assuming a 3.0 speed weapon, 1 application of Sunder could add just as much damage per swing as Rend ticks for... And Rend would still be 50% more effective in terms of damage per rage. 10 rage cost for Rend vs. 15 per Sunder.
---
Rend can also be dodged by the way.
---
who cares. cross realm bgs. also the way the system works doesn't change anything if more leave.
---
Not always though; there was a 60 druid ganking lowbies in darkshire the other day. Whenever a 60 came by he'd run away. According to general chat he had been it more or less all day. Obviously not the norm, but exceptions do exist.
---
Cadaverous armor from scholomance, wouldnt give up on sgc though, maybe just tone down your farm a bit
---
Lethlor ravine in the badlands has a few too.
---
Sure, but environmental variables like movement, fears, etc. can account for variances that aren’t accounted for in sims and the One True Spec.
---
If that wasn’t the case, everyone would do the exact same damage, every time.
---
Look, I have a human warrior because I want +5 swords. But I don’t spit on some dude who has a NE warrior. He’ll be just fine.
---
"go to retail" Yeah i stopped playing and cancelled my sub today on Smolderweb. Corpse ran to get UBRS ony attunement. Landed in winterspring to turn in and had 7 horde chase me for 2 mins before they killed me. PEACE Wow classic. it was fun while it lasted.
---
What's sad is you outnumber them 3:1 by your own admission but can't manage to use your numbers to fight them off in a game where: having more people &gt; literally everything else.
---
why would they make certain races explicitly better than others?
---
&gt;that they were a lot more like vanilla than classic is community wise.
---
Not really, the private servers were just better managed, and better balanced.
---
They had up to 3x the concurrent cap of classic, and they still worked better. The bloodbath was the same, and people were just as aggressive in PvP. But since the factions were balanced, and were always relatively equal in strength. You didn't get the situations where one faction dominates an entire area for a fucking week straight, that never happened. People were bitchfighting in BRM, and they could hold it for maybe an hour, and it would just constantly phase like that between the factions. 
---
So contested areas were literally contested.
---
Besides that I think it played out similarly to what we are seeing on classic now, especally in regards to the extreme min-maxing, and that "everyone" has engineering etc.
---
I'm loving the WS. I like that I can pull with it and never draw aggro. The boar and cat were so much slower because I couldn't always send them in first, and so when I couldn't I'd have to turn around or feign death to let them gain threat before I could attack again. WS is super fast soloing.
---
Do you not realize how common it is to have multiple accounts for some people?
---
&gt;I'm in this picture and I don't like it
---
FTFY
---
Ur friends are pussies
---
Its winter, sun isnt there anymore for long, also no forest here not even snow! :(
---
Yeah I know thats its just a videogame, but when you see the same post day after day and all those crybabies who goes like "MIMIMIMI SERVER IS UNBALANCED IT IS 49/51 HORDE FARM FP\`S ALL DAY I CANT DO SHIT WÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄHHH!" You get kinda pissed. Also those "The honor system is crap!" Well this game is fucking 15 years old, EITHER inform your self BEFORE playing the old game or just stop playing when you realize it isnt for you!
---
He had asked guildmates for help on ony atun for his alt to do a rend run. So 4 guildmates and 3 pug. A high value item dropped and he waited for everyone to greed then he rolled need.
---
IIRC, Hemo isn't normalized.
---
Is this... comedy?
---
Not if we are in a dungeon. Then we get smashmouth.
---
Flurry procs mh attacks I’d go that route if possible
---
Any particular herbs to save? I personally was selling here and there when the price for single herbs seemed p high
---
i am  curious what you expected anyone to do.  not participate in wpvp so that all of the small amount of initial alliance didnt leave?  wpvp didnt cause the huge faction imbalance initially, it just ended up that way.  gonna have the horde draw up a non-pvp treaty that every player on the server is going to follow?
---
i get that your upset but acting like the players had any chance at preventing this is just stupid and shifting the blame.  you seem to believe its a horde only issue but there are servers where its the exact same issue, only the alliance perpetrating it, heartseeker is a great example.  there are less of these cases, but it is not horde players fault that their faction is more popular.  theyre still the same exact humans IRL alliance are, but they picked the red team instead of the blue team.  again, attributing the issue to something completely arbitrary rather than blizzard.
---
Wow. I would 100% kick then.
---
Eh, there are so many ways this could work, all of them better than the current situation.
---
 -set it to -1 Max lvl kill is all. If your "PvP" raid is engaged in an aoe fight, they will surely kill lots of 55+, if not? Wtf is your raid doing? So... nbd.
---
He would be working it off till bwl comes out is the plan.
---
The "community feel" is really realm-dependent. 
---
The game itself quality-wise resembles very mediocre pserver interpretation of the game.
---
Which is perfectly fine. They just seem to have a problem with being judged for their choices
---
Lok ‘Tar baby
---
If you are horde and didn’t take the heartseeker wpvp dream buffet transfer on US. I’m sorry for ye; guess you liked FP camping and raid logging more than pvp
---
Iv thought about letting him decide his own fate.
---
Hot take: don't roll on a PvP server if you are going to be a Crybaby Casual. 
---
I rolled PvE server because I knew better. Lol
---
def not whitemane basically every pvp server with a high pop is bad for alliance. Earthfury is balanced and as alliance you wont be ganked everywhere you go but its medium pop so less players. The bare able high pop pvp servers for alliance would be Grobbulus, Incendius, and Benediction. If you don't mind being medium pop go to Earthfury for sure
---
Enen no Shouboutai
---
and 20 reddit accounts, and spend 40 minutes on each one leveling them to 5!
---
I know some people will take advantage of my kindness but I think most are legitimate rerollers that appreciate the help.
---
If by 100% like vanilla you mean min maxed to the nth then sure.
---
I can confirm this as well. Felwood and Un'goro were completely besieged by Alliance Deathsquads last night.
---
They we're my DnD group and most of them had never played WoW before. They were actually having a lot of fun PvPing in Phase 1 but when they can't even leave a zone thats being overrun, its time to come up with a solution.
---
Had fun kiting in TBC... I know it's trolling, but sending the Dark Portal Elites into one of the two starter zones was hilarious.

Blaming the devs is fine, blaming the devs to deflect from player accountability for their behavior is where the conflict is
---
Worse cause guildies were actually helping HIM out.
---
I've gotten azure silk vest, azure silk pants
---
these boost frost damage collectively by up to 17
---
However, despite frostbolts quicker cast time, fireball still does more damage per second even tho it takes a full second longer to cast
---
Also, when using more frostbolts to kill something than it would fireball, I feel it is contestable whether or not you actually save mana unless you're overdamaging.
---
Thoughts?
---
You are still ignoring crits and you don't get anything out of spamming rends, you get something out of spamming sunders.
---
And no, sunder will increase your damage by a lot more than rend does. Rend is literally useless after rank 3.
---
You blame people who are being forced to play a certain way set up by blizzard some fifteen years ago. The system is literally designed to rape and pillage as much as you can as fast as you can to competitively rank up. Without a actual PvP outlet like battle grounds the only choice is forced world pvp combat which if you have to go looking for people the most optimal way to do it is to sit in areas with high traffic. Did the horde intentionally kill the server, not really they just went by the rules they were given and being punished for it. People seem to forget this isn’t vanilla everything is figured out from gear to beat honor farming strategies. Get off your high ass horses and realize the real problem was 1) letting a huge imbalance to begin with 2) letting the rest of you rats jump ship without repercussion. Blizzard should have stepped in and I’m sorry they didn’t step in sooner but to blame horde is the wrong direction.
---
A hardcore private server PvP guild who got world first MC/Ony kills.
---
I main a healer. If it is troublesome for my healer he will either tell me or let me die.
---
How many rogues that are in your group.  If all you do is stealth and team up on people with a group of rogues you're going to win every time.
---
Can you move server?
---
Someone’s gotta be the 1st.
---
Theres a first for everything. If he did it once you all know he is completely capable of doing it again. Kick his ass.
---
Wait this is from the Guardian, I thought you said journalists are picking up the story?
---
These polls are based on characters, not players concurrently online. How do you know 5k is the server limit?
---
no your post is the kind of posts that'll turn this sub into the same boring shite place that is r/wow. People like you need to be told that, sorry you got so offended :)
---
Welp this is the response to their behaviour. Now these dip shit hordies r gonna basically never get r14 because there's basically no alliance left. Wanna be a min max pvp nolifer who ruins the game? Well this is what happens
---
&gt;I really don't understand in what world you guys live in
---
Perhaps you should ask yourself that, if you can't understand the irony of camping opposing faction players in their capital cities and then complaining on forums that the server is dead.
---
Best part of this is that rolling correct race only actually helps like 0.5% of players but for some reason rest of 99.5% think that their lack of skill can be fixed with having +5 with axes.
---
“WHY wOuLd You fLag yoUrsElf as a LEveL 1?”

Because that was literally the entire point of the video, genius.

I will upvote your comment because it is fair and honest, not because I agree in the blame distribution

I can only hope that /r/CamelotUnchained is watching this shit show and thinking of creative ways for force balance and population control.

I played on private servers and it was similar community experience except far more EU players mixed in

Typical redditor, day lol and don’t exam your failings
---
mdh5797

I love all these "Horde are such pricks in pvp" posts and "horde are everywhere" on here while meanwhile I'm on Pagle US the most (tied I think?) unbalanced server across all the US realms. In favour of the alliance, no less. Looking at all the data, horder &gt; alliance servers are much aligned than the alliance &gt; horde servers are. Interesting.
---
comment deleted lol this guy rolled horde just to post about his unbalanced server
---
Glad you agree with me
---
60/40 is noticeable and harder for the minority faction, but completely playable. This site is full of the loudest and weakest-minded crybabies around. The vast majority of PVP servers are somewhere around 60/40 H/A and most people aren't crying about it. I don't think Blizzard handled things perfectly, but keep in mind most of the people crying on here aren't even level 60.
---
Yeah totally this guy's attitude was really friendly in the replies here, no way at all to do this differently. Nope none at all. "Both do not work" is obtuse and shitty because they both do. What a weird thing to jump in and defend.
---
These are reddit comments it's all chill, still cringe worthy teenage attitude. Making fun of a dude for having a shit attitude is a chill experience imo, b
---
&gt; PvP server 
---
Not anymore.
---
Looks like pvp happened on a pvp server
---
Make friends. You get a solid 5 man group you can throat stomp the server and roll out when the fat zergs come in; check your honor spy; the horde at the top has the server on farm.
---
I understand this is 2019 and everyone is supposed to be all happy and jolly, but if you're the opposing faction my end goal is to make your life a living hell.  If you're on a pvp server and don't kill the opposing faction as much as possible you're doing it wrong.
---
Ok boomer
---
Yeah +17 probably isnt enough yet. Im not actually sure how much you would need to make it better, but later you will have hundreds of + frost damage. I also believe you would switch to rank 1 frost bolt to use the least amount of mana, and relying on your spellpower to do the damage
---
&gt; People no longer play a race, class or faction for the sake of it. Everything now revolves around "I must be the best of the best" and this guide will tell me how.
---
I had the choice between an Orc and a Tauren Warrior and I chose Tauren because I wanted to make a "moo" joke with his name
---
No honor; why defend and lose your honor gains to guards.
---
...? did you just assume I was apart of the "#NoChanges" crowd?
---
You're right. It is a tragedy for both side.
---
These are the only 2.
---
You can still use the dragonite, death ray, battle chicken, rocket boots and MC helmet.
---
I know it's possible, I just don't know how and haven't done the research on it, yet.
---
Naxx is WOTLK
---
Fire does really good damage, the only issue is current raids mobs/bosses have lots of fire resist so Fire spec is more for pvp until AQ40 i think.
---
The early end game experience of TBC is fantastic imho. 
---
Gearing through the tough heroic dungeons, farming unique flying mounts &amp; kara is just a lot of fun.
---
Hunter?? 
---
I’m a warrior mining/herb so my options are a bit limited
---
Also yes pvp happened on a pvp server - enjoy trying to rank up when there's like 15 actual alliance players left hahahahahaha
---
BRD use burning steps. Shit should chill out this Tuesday. But we’ll see, that’s only the general consensus opinion :0
---
Ally on skeram aren't pussies, they fight back hard and organized. Respect to my enemies.
---
hard disagree
---
BGs are out in 4 days?
---
People said there were 20 alliance raiding guild and they all decided to leave. Couldn't they handle their shit for 2 weeks? That's not like they were 0 in the first place
---
Spoiler, BGs won't stop people from camping you out in the world. Especally not after a few weeks when people start getting exalted with AV.
---
Who is Mark, and are you a top or bottom?
---
Took me three hours (three resets) to farm 5 MCPs. That's super not worth it. I'd only do it if we're trying to do like a super fast MC. Just way too much time.
---
Can confirm. Currently leveling as Alliance on Bene. Love the constant back and forth while questing.
---
Yeah, many private servers were tuned to be harder
---
Hang in there. It only took me 139 runs for HOJ.
---
I'm probably close to 200 runs for SGC and still haven't seen it.
---
Yeah I already said that.
---
While leveling you generally use which ever spell you got the latest, so sometimes frostbolt does more dmg/casttime sometimes it’s firebolt. The deeper you get in you frost tree the more sense it makes to actually prioritize frostbolt tho
---
Your friends are whiner bitches and so are you pve realms exist for a reason.
---
Some of the more hardcore members of my guild definitely feel like they will gimp their PVE progression if they fall behind in honor because a lot of the rank 13 gear is comparable with BWL gear and they will get loot counciled the pieces they want because other raiders will get much more of an upgrade on the pieces they don't want. (They're the type of people that are on 16 hours a day anyway so I don't doubt they can achieve it) It's kinda BS if you think about it, having to PvP to get an edge in PvE. I'm sad I'll be losing like 80% of the tanks I enjoy playing with for a long time :(
---
How do I find a pre bis list for fury?
---
As a guild master myself on retail I would say kick.
---
That makes sense, thanks
---
65/35 is 2.5 to 1? The intelligence of the average reddit crybaby is truly amazing.
---
I did! It was not easy, I raged in guild chat and to my friends for days, but they were understanding. The Silithus mob I got to 5% without using any warlock cheats, but I was so tired of waiting for spawns etc that I finished him with a warlock. All others legit.
---
Really? spellpower bonuses help that much?
---
Gonna turtle.
---
Lok’tar cowards
---
The system is not at fault when it goes to this level of excess.
---
Nobody needed to kill all those lowbies, the shit honor people got didnt need to farmed from lvl 48s.
---
Shit if people didnt have a premade ready for bgs, they had no reason to do this but yet they did anyway because they didnt think at all.
---
Server transfers were closed on Thursday. I'm doing fine since I went hardcore and got a couple 60s; its the DnD amigos that leveled slow that have quit in Phase 2... Sucks.
---
BWL loot is much better than MC loot - not sure why you'd bother giving a ninja looter a chance at it
---
Haha. Whatever you gotta tell yourself, dude. Your server is one of the most busted. IF on farm status 24/7. The only thing standing between Skeram and Flamelash's fate is open ~~faction~~ server transfers.
---
&gt; You do understand that you can flag for pvp on a PVE server and always stay flagged this always have that risk and danger if you so choose? 
---
But it's meaningless when anyone who you come across can choose not to be flagged.  It's great you like to flag and get that risk and danger, I like to have that all the time or the game gets boring for me.
---
&gt; The thing you won't have and which is really why people roll on PVP servers is the ability to gank everyone you see corpse camp people into quitting or destoy a server due to faction imbalance.
---
Yeah but this isn't the majority of people on pvp servers at all.  It's a very small minority who typically get bored of it and leave before the people they're ganking.
---
The point is on a pvp server if there's some people ganking and making it impossible to quest in a given area then you have to react to that and work around it.  That might mean going somewhere else, grouping up, getting friends to come and kill them, whatever it is.  This is a dynamic player choice driven feature in the game that people on pve servers completely remove and replace with an artificial sense of safety.  If that's what you want, great, but a lot of people think that ruins the game - which is why pvp servers are still more popular than pve servers even in phase 2.
---
I know you said you got it working, but for others that see this, downloading from curse forge gets the retail version. To get the classic version, you have to scroll down on curse forge and you'll see 2 files, 1 for retail and 1 for classic
---
Lol.  Ok boomer.
---
fuck off and die you whiners
---
They are the only spec with stealth and ranged burst. Thats a strong combination.
---
Down ranking is huge. Healers do it too. They will have multiple ranks of heals on there bar for different levels of healing required.  Saving mana is a big part of boss encounters/being efficient
---
Duck that, keep that toxic mess away from my pve servers. We have a nice balance of people, while also still being able to get materials sometimes. Let them make their bed and lie in it
---
just under 1.5k on whitemane alli, so 300g is very good rofl.
---
No, just toxic player.
---
That just proves my point really doesn't it?
---
Troll somewhere else kid. I think it's your nap time. Take your dead servers with you.
---
I would stay combat swords while leveling out in the world just for efficiencies sake.  Combat daggers is good too if you do mostly dungeons.
---
Also you wouldn't run hemo with a dagger as you use backstab as the point generator.  Pretty much any other slow/top end heavy weapon works with it though.
---
Enjoy your 1h+ waiting time in bg queue.
---
How do u know they are bots
---
I've played WoW since launch and have seen the horde-exclusionary, alliance-hating meme grow since they started normalizing the game in BC. At this point it is (in large part) the community's fault for the state of the server imbalances and the overall horde population domination. Look at the way that an influencer like tipsout talked to people during faction preference discussions before the game came out... it was nonstop "horde is the correct pick" rhetoric. soda, too.
---
horde domination is the result of a bad meme gone too far
---
I still dunno how it works although we do it with 17-20men splitraids quite often.   
---
Our tactic is for those who got aggro to run to the tankspot and suicide, there'd obviously be the stoneskin pot option but we never did that.   
---
Anyways, if we splitraid and more then 1 Healer somehow get aggro p3 we tend to whipe.
---
wait you think you have offended me pal? I play WoW, takes thick skin when you're as hated as I am. But who are you to say what is and isn't allowed on a public forum or thread? You are a nobody just like the rest of us.
---
THE HUNTER IS NOTHING WITHOUT THE HUNT!
---
That's great for you, doesn't change my generalized observation.
---
Why get banned for saying no shoes? O.o dafuq xD
---
Blizz provided no info on faction balances and not enough PvP servers at launch.  This led to a concentration of players onto a few mega servers with heavy imbalance.  How would you have had players act differently? Roll ali?  By the time most realised the imbalance it was too late.  Move servers?  That is having the player take the flack for blizz's lack of foresight.  In fact the server transfers are literally just pushing the problem to elsewhere.   
---
Blizz should have posted faction realm info and had far more PvP servers at launch and this wld have been nipped in the bud before growing to this size issue.  It's on blizz to manage and maintain their game and user base, not the end user.
---
Westwood headquarters was across the street from my high school.  Was cool seeing it every time I left school on my way home to play C&amp;C.
---
This is sage advice - guilds looking for DPS love DPS warriors and you'll start out if anything in situational off-tanking once in a while. Likely MT/OT is a done deal except for low percentage turnover, so you have to start as DPS who can slap on a shield for some fights and offtank. It's that plain and simple.
---
Do you have a source for the 3x concurrent of classic?  I’m genuinely curious since I was researching this early and found that the highest ever concurrent was around 10k during the ZG opening.   
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/NostalBegins/status/671059079658381314
---
Possibly, but I haven't seen one post from Heartseeker like I have the others.
---
Perfect representation lol 😂
---
im on grobby :P
---
how do you know the horde is helpless and the alliance is raid tier geared?  You inspect them?  You must be on heartseeker or something.  I've never seen alliance have that much of an advantage on my server.
---
Horde won. It is the best faction, and this proved it.
---
They're two different things.  Showing up to raid is already a time commitment.
---
I think you shouldn't be guild master if you defer decisions to a vote and still can't make a decision to break a tie.
---
You need to find something better to do with your time
---
It’s been confirmed the 10th
---
The thing that bothers me the most is that, since BGs are cross realm, they will still be able to PvP even though they ruined their own server.
---
Showing up for Benny
---
Never claimed to be good. Never claimed stuff wasn’t out of balance. Never claimed corpse running was any kind of fun. 
---
I merely pointed out what people signed up for when they rolled on a PvP server.
---
So many people projecting in this thread, it’s unreal.
---
I, as a total pleb, am left wondering why it is not equal for draenei to be shaman
---
If they brought in cross realm shit beyond battlegrounds it will just be a cascade effect  of changes until classic ends up with no community just like retail.
---
I'm not sure what point you're making.  Are you trying to disprove the tragedy of the commons?
---
&gt;it simply does not make sense for most people to be doing what they're doing atm (grouping up into raids and camping FPs for hours on end)
---
this is an opinion, they gain honor this way and since bgs aren't out yet, it is likely that this is their only good source of honor farm.  Your premise is incorrect.
---
He would do it again if he could, just kick before that happens
---
Wow I am at the same spot as you! It took me 3 months to get to lvl 50 I also couldn't play for the past week or so and when I logged back in there was a dead server.
---
I tried playing but it just feels empty... I don't know how to describe it. Unsubscribing too.
---
I honestly think this p2 outcry on this sub is a marketing tactic by Blizzard to get us on board with and excited for Burning Crusade for Classic. 
---
Full disclaimer: I think most of the social media we consume is a marketing tactic. 
---
Because, I mean, it is, isn’t it.
---
Changes in products are driven by economic statistical data. Always has been. Blizzard went through this exact same process before. They released something awesome, they fielded feedback from millions of people. They made changes as they went, appeasing people to keep subscriptions. And they got what they got. 
---
And they’re doing it all over again. Except this time, they’re doing it better. They know exactly what people tend to be peeved by. They know how to create and then remedy the issues. They’re min maxing the company. They act like they’re allowing us another run through. But really, this is them at 60, farming gold.
---
Its already happening.
---
found the toxic shit. hazmat team please!
---
xrealm bgs are not a solution to imbalance, they make the problem worse.  a higher ratio of alliance will be in bgs, which means a higher ratio of horde will be ganking in the world, if you thought it was impossible to lvl before, the worst is to come
---
The issue wasn't horde getting paladins.
---
It was the race specific seals that existed, the seal of Blood, unique to Blood Elf Paladins, that was OP.
---
You should seek medical help if you honestly think what you wrote is the truth.
---
Free vanilla servers in any game have always seemed to bring out the most toxic of toxic players.  Project1999 comes to mind.  From the GMs on down it was a cesspool of man children on a mission to out e-badass each other.  Wow classic feels very different.
---
1 is punishing the underdogs and won't solve the problem at all. They would just quit or reroll.
---
2 would go against vanilla and no changes crowd would reeeee
---
The "abstained from PvP for a month" thing is a hypothetical example that illustrates how pointless it was to do what many players are doing for this past month, at the cost of the game's health. 
---
You could do casual / light PvP in smaller groups or solo, you could level up an alt, you could help guildies out, you could attempt challenges such as soloing certain content.
---
There's many other things in this game than spending hundreds of hours sitting by an FP or on a boat and griefing everyone that comes by. So if "doing the same thing a thousand times" seems boring to you, you have a pretty good incentive not to do "PvP" the way many are doing it right now.
---
Skip Dranei, go straight to Dwarves!
---
Just don’t give blood elf pallies a better seal than alliance Paladins.
---
That’s really it. Horde Ret Paladins &gt; alliance Ret Paladins. Make em equal and it’s not a big deal.
---
Paladins are better for PvP, which is where horde dominates (population wise)
---
There are many things wrong with your replies. 
---
First, you decided to make two separate replies. The first response was saying “hey glad you have an opinion, doesn’t change mine” which is great, should’ve ended there. Then you made a new post to just put me down, which accomplished what?
---
Second, your original post said “...every pvp server is horde dominated because kiddos gotta have their racials.” This is a factual statement made by you that is incorrect. If you’re going to use definitive counts, expect someone on the opposite side to point out that you’re wrong. That’s simply not true. If it was a generalized point it wouldn’t say “every server is this way cuz kids gotta have racials.” That isn’t the only reason that this problem occurs
---
I’d be happy to expand further but I’m at work and can’t devote too much immediate time to this, sorry.
---
Yea because class balance is the only thing im looking for from a game, specially a highly contested E-sport like WoW is.
---
Yep! It's still rough, but not as bad as a lot of other servers. We have a pretty solid balance. Grob is an awesome server, and I'm so glad I rolled on it!
---
Gnome shaman, BUT, totems MUST scale with size.
---
#TinyTotems
---
I love how people like you are saying they remember what it was like in 2004 like it was yesterday. Rose tinted glasses. Just calm down and wait til BGs come out
---
Approximately how long will it take to get Exalted with AV?
---
&gt;I’m okay with the idea of “templates” in arena format exclusively to satisfy all these hyper competitive pvp players who want a level playing field. Arena should be the place for homogenized, scales fights. Blizzard can fine tune balance within the templates and not fuck with any external pvp or pve progression.
---
I can agree with this. I stopped at wrath, but the idea of templates for arenas always appealed to me.
---
You are underestimating the extent that gear matters in late classic, though. If your stance is "that is how it should be," then fair enough. But how it is now isn't even close to the disparity that naxx gear brings. The difference in a fresh 60 now and the most geared players is less than the difference between those same geared players and naxx geared players. Not impossible, but the skill gap has to be gigantic.
---
Like, a naxx geared pom pyro mage would have to be brain dead to lose to me with the gear I have now. Pop trinkets, dont get reflected, win.
---
Wouldn't you not pop evation because of overpower?
---
We don't have BG, but I get what you're saying. That doesn't make it correct. The realm itself is PVP, BG is a cross-realm experience. Hope this clears it up for you.
---
I think I will dragon booty 27 but before I leave you should know you are also a whiner and should do something else.
---
I should have posted more information. There are other things I think about. I am not a perfect guild leader but i try my best.
---
&gt; max their character out fast
---
But see that's the problem - you're literally proving my point! The core issue is the culture! Thousands of people refuse to just. Play. The. Game. For. Fun.
---
Why is all about maxing out as fast as possible? Why? What's it for? What's the point? These people do this EVERY TIME and then complain about having nothing to do and then whine about the game is boring and needs to be changed and that's how we end up with retail wow.
---
Just the play game for fun!!!! And if you're not having fun... Stop!!
---
Like I said, that's just what I've experienced. However, as it turns out it would appear to be more relevant than you choose to admit. 
---
It seems I've read that the ability to report on the classic populations has gone away, perhaps? Still, I did a quick google search on "wow classic census" and the first four results all reported a higher overall Alliance population across all realms. Perhaps there are a few realms that skew the overall numbers, but if it were as bad as you say, I can't believe that's the case.
---
Proof?  Or you're ignant.
---
Great example of player agency though right? 
---
It takes me less than 5 minutes to get to MC from Ironforge, I don't need to carve out an hour or cowboy up prior to my raid and risk losing my buffs if an undead rogue decides to punch my ticket. 
---
PvE privilege is being able to sit in your main city without the risk of getting merked by a guy who sits there 16 hours a day
---
lmao imagine getting ganked only every 30 minutes.
---
I would sign up for this.
---
Besides everything else that I’ve said already, the “difficulty” is also what’s so appealing.
---
Wow I am not attacking  I explained and backed my arguments.  You are the person  who attacked me and keeps attacking.  You did not even think about what I said or tried to realise what I mean.
---
It's  sad dude, if you  can't  admit defeat.
---
Been out of the loop for a bit, can someone ELI5 what’s happening on that server?
---
Found the whiner pvp team go
---
What about Kangs? I used that from 44-60.
---
Ita goof, the multiboxing paladin
---
You generally are correct, rank 1 frostbolt is generally used for a quick slow in pvp. You don't usually downrank as often as a mage, because you get a lot more damage per mana at the higher ranks of spells. You can downrank spam to fish for a clear casting proc (arcane talent, very good for aoe grinding) but that only really happens when completely oom
---
Probably because the warrior discord did all kind of benchmarks and has already proven that it's literally useless?
---
I am 100% sure your calculations are wrong compared to what we in the warrior discord already calculated and wrote down.
---
I like this idea, but I say leave it in for high level zones. Or narrow the level ranges that give honor.
---
That's entirely speculation.  But we do know the vast majority of people that play video games are kids, which is what I said.
---
Did you not read any of it? Bad heals and combat utility? Blessings like protection/freedom are huge utility. Ret dps isn’t negligible either, crit and judgement or reckoning bombs can hurt in pvp. I don’t think a priest can out do a ret in every category in one pvp fight.
---
To be fair I'm alliance and would kill gnomes if I could.
---
I just don't see how your screenshot says anything.  The first thing I thought of was a multiboxer.
---
&gt; Go to the elementals in the South west part of the zone, I am sure you will see at least 4.
---
I need to know what server.
---
"flametrash" lol :D
---
I love these “blizzard cant afford customer service reps, so let’s program new features like queues and in game effects” posts
---
Wow what a piece of shit lmao.

This is the best one I can find from Nostalrius, and it was made some time before the server was shutdown. The server also only got more popular as time went by, and it lasted for like a year maybe after ZG was out, and was preparing for the AQ event.
---
Then the follow-up private servers after nost went black became hugely popular as well, due to extreme exposure that happened when Nost was shutdown.

---
Yeah if anything has rose tinted goggles in regards to WoW 15 years ago it's those saying there were less bad people
---
If you are a mage try to give them some food/water. I have never met a player that will turn down free food/water. Bots will instantly close the trade window and won't respond to you asking them if they want any free food/water.
---
Preach! This is why I loved Guild Wars 1. All content remained valid till you maxed out.
---
It's worse. The effect from Kang is basically useless while leveling, the hit and strength is a lot better.
---
Kang has like 2.3 DPS more but is missing the hit and is faster.
---
Alliance is better tho... look at parses.. paladins are just stronger 😂
---
During Vanilla, Alliance had a pretty significant population advantage.  While people often say shit like "better storylines" or some other shit, the reality came down to the races themselves and people like "pretty races".  This is really buoyed by the fact that Blood Elves are the most played race in retail.
---
While Alliance did get shaman, they got shaman on a race which people were not only interested in playing.  What this means for classic is that the race people want to play the most is actually not available AND horde have a massive pop advantage.  Should they get blood elves and paladins, the Alliance population would be severely hampered.  If you look at pve server where alliance have an advantage you can see where this would have a huge effect.  Paladins have a huge impact on raiding with salvation.  Despite horde having higher potential dps with windfury, salvation dramatically increases margin of error for people doing encounters.  The absolute top end guilds may not have an issue, but the tiers below that level have salvation and paladins as a significantly more important part of the raids than shaman.  Shaman do eventually catch up quite a bit in AQ/Naxx with their healing potential, but especially through BWL, paladins provide a massive advantage.
---
The basic premise is, Horde have a huge advantage in population right now without having the most popular race in the game AND the class which is giving pve servers the alliancce bias.  Giving horde both would probably shift the game to an 80/20 bias in total.
---
Blizzard did say they were listening to the community and polls done on this sub had people wanting larger servers than we originally had in vanilla. Now everyone is whining and complaining about server size.

Farming mats definitely aren’t dailies.

May seem to appeal that way; but one stomp is enough to hold a couple multishots of aggro plus throw in a FD there’s no way you can peel them off the Rilla in my experience. Just my .02 though. I love my Harambe
---
Just make some new servers then everyone wins
---
I think that in a fantasy game it's more important to choose a race thats apprarance pleases you and fits your characters fantasy than something that looks good on calculations on paper. Also insignificant racial stat like 5% more int doesn't even matter unless you are doing everything else perfectly and min-maxing every single detail. Good human mage will anal rape your gnome mage 10-0 if you are even an average player.
---
Ah yes it's the alliances fault for leaving hahabahahahahahahahahaha
---
Just replace horde with "player" bc it happens on both sides depending on the server. Butthurts.
---
Ahh fudge....
---
I played video games back in 2004 and that was not the attitude at all. You think people wouldn’t 3v1 people in halo or any other multiplayer game? Delusion at its finest. Enjoy your care bear server ✌🏼
---
The goal of battlegroups is to speed up ques overall throughout all points of the day. Without them, late night and early morning players are screwed. Low pop servers are totally doomed. It's not elegant, it is over suggested and bad
---
They don’t give two shits about the classic player base and us. It’s so sad they would rather worry more about their stupid pathetic cash shop and the garbage retail is than the actual good version of the game.
---
Layering is a change.  They shouldn't have done that to hide potential issues like this.

This sub is a fucking circle jerk for shitty alliance players who can't handle phase 2.

Op talking about pvp.

Depends on the type of pvp
---
Sorry :(
---
Servers are massively bigger now, that would appear to only be a problem on low population server which is not really applicable here. 
---
That being said this statement will not change your mind.
---
Edit: maybe the middle ground is only servers with even balances or low populations have battle groups.

---
&gt; Roll ~~druid, stealth around and level in instances~~ on a server that doesn't suck.
---
100% false lol. They have a good place on defense in arathi and AV, excluding the lack of ranged dmg, but overall a paladin outshines them easily. More reliable burst as a dps. Tankiness. Stronger pvp heals. Stronger defenses for the paladin and others.
---
What do u mean? Its not obvious, lots of the posts are horde complaining as well this state sucks for us all... but keep dragging those stats out
---
First of all, there are Alliance dominated servers too. Second, faction queues and faction only xfers would balance out as many servers as possible. If overall there are 60% horde and 40% Alliance, so be it. Alliance can queue faster and there's an incentive to re-roll.
---
But it avoids creating dead servers.
---
I'm just trying to play my Orc on a 90% Alliance server :( I feel so sad and attacked by all these posts
---
So you're saying it's people's fault for choosing a server and not researching external websites like reddit before picking one? What the fuck man. Typical Horde logic. I picked my server the night classic released. I just tried to get in one ASAP and start playing. How could anyone accurately know the server balance at that point?
---
&gt;I'm not sure what point you're making.  Are you trying to disprove the tragedy of the commons?
---
Read again.
---
"Tragedy of the commons" is a term that describes a type of situation. That's all it is. It does nothing to describe the mental state of the parties involved or a way out of the situation.  The reality is, a lot of people who experience "tragedy of the commons" type situations are simply consumbed by the paradox of voting fallacy, where they convince themselves that their individual contribution to the betterment of the situation is inconsequential when the larger collective doesn't also change its behaviour. 
---
It is extremely easy to illustrate how that is a fallacy, when veganism (a similar "tragedy of the commons" type situation for all intents and purposes) has gained so much traction largely through individual initiatives, rather than any specific policy change from a government or other large body of authority.
---
&gt; this is an opinion 
---
No, it is not. You simply do not understand the system if you think that. It's not like it's a new system, people have been participating in it for 15 years, we understand very well how it plays out.
---
The number of players that can attain higher ranks is limited. The players that will attain those ranks, are those that will go extremely out of their way to game the system. They will make 10 man WSG premades that dodge every other premade religiously and go for extreme efficiency in time/win. They will coordinate among each other to make sure that they will claim the top standings, excluding other players on their faction. That is what it takes to get to rank 13, and to get to rank 14, many will play literally 18 hours a day, and account share for the remaining 6 hours.
---
Meanwhile, for the average person who won't be invited to aforementioned r13 groups and won't account share, their rank point gain will cap out at whatever their AV luck affords them. This means that realistically most won't climb above rank 10/11, perhaps 12 on servers with less coordination at the top level. Those players spent this past month griefing players in order to get to that ceiling faster.
---
&gt; is their only good source of honor 
---
But it is not even a good source of honor. If you've been playing since P2 started you should be at LEAST r6  right now, r7 realistically, if you want to hit the top rank spots. Otherwise you're simply not competing, you're just wasting your time and the time of those you grief, and you could have gotten to rank 4/5 (the rank most people in these groups are at) by playing mostly casually and doing some solo/small group PvP here and there, then to your eventual rank ceiling by doing AV like everyone else.
---

I think you can AoE fest almost that entire dungeon actually with a pala tank and warlock set up (just spam Seed of Corruption) which are the classes that wants to farm it anyways for the exalted reward. (not sure about pallies, but I think warlocks got like a good one handed sword or something).
---
And maybe its a bit tough if you are just freshly dinged 70, but its certainly not the ultra hard content people remember it as being.
---
blaming blizzard for antisocial players ruining their own server, lol
---
More reliable burst than a Shaman? lol you have no idea what you're on about
---
Not all servers are bigger. Population differs across the majority of servers, so you are a bit I'll informed. 
---
Knowing full well that your suggestion has been brought up before and proven worthless, I dont really need to change my mind lol
---
4-5 weeks of daily play at most. 2 weeks if you no life it.
---
Lots of good replies. The toughest thing to address is that a lot of pvpers don't care about the honor, just the grief. I honestly don't know how to address that issue outside of something like negative honor, which would be super hard to control with world pvp.
---
Awe poor guys.
---
Premades
---
Seal of blood? I started on a bekf pally in tbc but don’t remember it that well
---
What is your alternative?
---
When you get imp frostbolt it will likely be better a 2.5 second cast compared to 3.5 is a big deal. Also getting frost damage will obviously make frostbolt better but if your focus is aoe farming then you likely will get little to no spellpower so that won't matter. AoE spells get very little benefit from spellpower so if you're doing that primarily all you want is int/stam.   
---
I'd recommend just shooting something with firbolt and seeing how long it takes to kill then shooting another thing with the same health with frostbolt and comparing. As others have said when getting the new rank that spell will see a big boost in power so what is better might flip.
---
That's not bad at all... think you just gave me another goal for when I reach 60, thank you!
---
Not drinking causes wipes.

TBC was good but it had plenty of issues as well. Mainly the old world became obsolete in TBC and flying ruined world pvp.

Difference between the two is one can be one shotted and the other can crit for 600+ with the durability of a tank.
---
[Here is a vid showcasing a 29 twink warrior and they’re not even bis](https://youtu.be/2-sxO6IXiGI). Next thing you’ll say is “a twink killing noobs?” but that’s like half the reason people make twinks, to just roll over groups of 2+ people and to take on enemies much higher level than you. And of course to play the game of chess between other twinks.

To answer your actual question only: yes for pvp no for pve. It will beef you a little more and the 8p bonus is obviously worthless for pvp. You already have plenty of mitigation for pve so the 15% threat would be better.
---
Addressing 8p t1: consider 5p + Lionheart/2 other slots. Wristband of trueflight/t2 legs/onslaught girdle/savage bp or chromatic/edgemaster are just a few options for the other two slots.

&gt; I think that in a fantasy game it's more important to choose a race thats apprarance pleases you and fits your characters fantasy than something that looks good on calculations on paper. 
---
That's your opinion and you're entitled to it. Others have a different opinion. To me the graphics in classic look like shit and 99% of the time I'm staring at the far back of a blob wearing incredibly stupid looking gear so I could not possibly care less about my character's appearance. 
---
&gt; Good human mage will anal rape your gnome mage 10-0 if you are even an average player.

---
No of course not, I'm just saying that you'll probably see them less, because they'll be in BG's.
---
problem is they are just estimates. the official blizzard stats are just full/high etc. it doens't say the ratio. blizzard even killed the census mod. then they make it worse by offering character transfers. so who knows the real population of your server. so you can't say "o those people should have known even though blizzard went out of their way to hide the information."
---
I’m with you. It’s unbearable not being able to farm the consumables I need for raids too. Or generally go anywhere to do anything regarding the world. 
---
SimCity Ironforge edition isn’t fun...
---
Go find mobs and cast shadowbolt.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying TBC Heroics were "t3h sh1tzz". It just disagree putting them on par with Vanilla End-Game dungeons. And while Paladin Tanks are certainly going to be there, their time to shine comes way later Tier 5/6, but just like "omg method is gonna stomp those pserver noobs at rag race", we can only wait and truly see, can't we?
---
There has to be an incentive to play alliance on unbalanced servers. Right now there isn’t. The problem is easy to fix, if you roll alliance on a horde dominate server you get a free lvl 60 toon of your choosing. There are so many people who couldn’t hit 60 before phase 2 dropped and they completely quit the game. Give those people a reason to come back and give them a reason to roll alliance.
---
It was always like that... If I could choose, I'd pick TBC. But I'm fine with Classic as I didn't get to play Vanilla back in the day. So happy either way.
---
I mean there was a post on his a few days ago saying his experiences so much better now that he switched servers. How the pvp battles were so much fairer and equal, until of course you find out he moved to a 75/25 alliance server. Everyone is a hypocrit when he shoe is on the other foot.
---
apparently if you are horde its camping the faction you outnumber  2:1 like a REAL gamer
---
If you're losing 1v1s to warriors as a rogue, or think anything else than the rogue being supremely favored in that 1v1, I will ignore anything you say about the rogue class... It's literally the freest matchup, bleed and kite and then what can the warrior do?
---
Yeah I agree mate I also used to play Runescape. Loved it. But I'm just thinking of what I should is most likely to happen, not what I think should happen.   
---
They could in a couple years have Classic realms, TBC realms and WotLK realms. I don't think Blizzard really cares, either way it will mean monthly subscriptions for them for low effort.
---
&gt;It's too imbalanced
---
But alliance is not even a faction in TBC.
---
People are still debating wheter alliance is better in raiding or in organized PvP in classic. In TBC there is no debate. Horde is objectively better at literally everything. And if you want to play retribution paladin, you have no choice but to play horde for seal of blood to be even remotely viable.
---
Triggered?  Isn't the very poster of this thread "triggered" by posting this at all?
---
Why would anybody why to tho? Ret paladins werent automatic garbage in tbc, but they still weren't _good_
---
Can't wait to not queue WSG/AB to let the horde on overpopulated servers eventually die out to attrition.
---
AV is mandatory for everyone, but after that they will suffer.
---
Actually on my server it was Alliance who started this shit. Now it's full on no mercy killing, we kill every Alliance we see.
---
Its like that for most alliance on PVP servers. PVP servers are heavily Horde favoured for obvious reasons. Its 15 years of this game and its CLEAR that the Horde have stronger racials especially for PVP hence why more PVP centric people will go to Horde for the min/maxing ( Why got Human for PVP when you can go Orc and get 25% stun resist ). Ontop of that, you have people who KNOW from experience from before that Horde have the better end of the deal and will go to the Horde because theyve already experienced the trash that Alliance comes with. So they'll go to the Horde knowing itll be the winning team.

As opposed to killing low levels in a BG. Except he’s killing players above his level... Flawless logic bro. Dude, I don’t know why you’re so defensive over this lol. I also don’t know why you’re trying
---
Any idea if server transfers will ever be allowed?
---
Vis’Kag Rogues can pull the kill off.
---
What's wrong with arms in raids? Why wouldn't they want us using mortal strike?
---
Only having one decent server to play vanilla on was a unique feeling. We had all kinds of players from all countries playing on one platform. This had its ups and downs but I also met great folks on them.
---
With Classic, some of the meta changed. People aren't leveling anymore. They're just boosting themselves in dungeons 18-60. Five mages closing themselves in a dungeon with spellcleave groups instead of playing out in the open world.
---
Perhaps the biggest problem with private servers was the staff corruption and gold selling, but it was handled formidably well. The servers had their own vanilla blizzlike game masters that ensured stability in the server. Our current Blizzard is too money hungry to employ a few people to look after their servers.
---
Not to mention Classic being managed by Blizzard is probably its largest drawback. The developers have already started to tone down community engagement. There was quite a lot of feedback during the development process and a lot of desires were met but we have to remember that every decision that the current devs are making has to go through the big corporate gate first. Needless to say, we can expect some controversy popping up in the future. I just don't trust Blizz with continuing the game's life cycle as much as I would with an independent team of nerds that really just love the game.
---
Imagine actually thinking you're going to be fighting against low levels in bg's.
---
Probably why you think 29 warrior twinks are a thing.
---
Lol, yea I'm one of the 15 year ago ones. I just re-watched a bwl strats video to see how much I remembered. I totally forgot the Chromaggus colors, but I at least remembered the Nef fight mechanics, I'm sorry to all the hunters out there, it's gonna be a rough first time or two for them and the repair bot makers, invest in fused wiring now, it's gonna be crazy expensive soon enough.
---
&gt;1.12 talents with 1.2 itemization
---
&gt;un-blizzlike class mechanics (sit-critting, certain buffs stacking when they shouldn't, etc)
---
&gt;half the server being chinese players
---
&gt;buggy scripting
---
&gt;broken quests that just don't work because they're not scripted properly
---
&gt;admins spawning rank14 characters for money
---
&gt;incorrect armor/damage/health values, massively overtuned
---
&gt;"more like vanilla"
---
:thonking:
---
I think it's fun, I have lots of fun ranking and Pvp currently
---
&gt; Why werent transfers offered earlier to balance unbalanced realms? Why werent factions restricted on over-dominated realms?
---
This is something that can swing so quickly, a knee jerk reaction like this could of destroyed a servers balance the other way. Especially as it was not clear how many people were going to stay around at the start, as well as from what faction they would be. 
---
&gt; Why has no official faction data been released?
---
This is an awful idea which would of made this exact problem 100 times worse. People would only join servers where their faction has stronger representation. 
---
&gt; Why wasnt the Silithus/EPL PvP events released at the same time?
---
Would not have changed the Wpvp behaviours at all. People would still look for the fastest way to gain honour, and it would not be from doing Silithus pvp. 
---
Releasing BGs with the honour system is really the only thing they could of done to alleviate the problem, and even then im unsure how much of an effect it would of have. Horde would still be facing long queue and so would look for the very methods they are doing now to farm honour.
---
#nochanges doesn't exist. This is classic not vanilla. We have 4x + players.
---
Warriors have a reactive ability called Overpower on a 5 second CD that does this: "Instantly overpower the enemy, causing weapon damage plus X.  Only useable after the target dodges.  The Overpower cannot be blocked, dodged or parried." They also have talents that increase the crit rate // dmg of overpower. Vs a dual weilding warrior it isn't as scary because it's just their main hand doing it, and dual wielders aren't as scary anyway as rogue because they proc parry and you get free Ripostes (deals dmg and disarms for 6 sec, only usable after you party). I didn't know they had this until I fought one 39 warrior when I was 37 and I used evasion and he blasted my ass with two 500 dmg crits. (the animation for this,  at least for orcs, is as if they are winding a pickaxe up all the way behind their head and then bringing it down full force on some ore, or a huge hammer onto a nail). 
---
I learned about sacrifice and shield when a warlock's demon instantly disappeared, he started glowing yellow, and suddenly all my attacks started getting absorbed. I learned to CC him with abilities like blind into stealth sap into stealth sap (second sap doesn't last as long due to diminishing returns but it is necessary in order to guarantee a full 30 sec for shield to expire). Fears are the bane of any melee yes but I enjoy the game of applying mind numbing poison and constantly rotating thru kick, gouge (even if it barely lasts at all) kidney shot (even for 1 combo point), anything to stop the cast while I beat on them.  Things will get harder vs lvl 40+ warlocks now since they have death coil (nukes you, heals them, fears for 3 sec, INSTANT CAST, 2 min CD). But I have found out that you can "dodge" it with Vanish since it is a projectile and that vanish is slightly generous with ability dodging when batching happens. So I will be trying that eagerly next time I fight a 40+ warlock. 
---
Druids don't have the luxury of having fifty different interrupts like rogues so IDK how you'd go about the same "vs warlock" fight. 
---
Priests at full hp full mp  are yeah ATM just impossible for me between PW:S and psychic scream spam. Even moreso if they have blackout stuns. I'll need to either blind them at the same batch that they psychic scream me (big luck) or just wait until I get my anti-fear trinket come Tuesday.
---
Because ret paladins are popular, people like the class identity, and unfortunately Blizz didn't get it right until wotlk.
---
&gt;but they still weren't good
---
You can probably bring one, if he is belf aka horde.
---
I had a lot of fun with that system. Just wished that resilience and battle fatigue wasn’t a major band-aid fix for mops out of control damage scaling
---
This. And when should it stop? When all TBC is out and cleared, then people will scream for WotLK. And then we have recreated Retail once more.
---
If more should be added, it should be Classic+. But as others say, I do not either trust Blizzard with this idea.
---
Gave you an award for this :)! I have a lvl 60 in Kirtonos but it feels so horde dominant that it makes world pvp boring as a horde character. Would it be worth rolling a new character in a completely different server from my main? I want to find a balanced one with high pop and heard good things about benediction and kromcrush
---
Or shower
---
They can all do some great damage. At the later stages warriors tend to top the charts
---
The second flying mounts or daily quests are introduced, I’m gone! Everything else about TBC was pretty good though.
---
This is complete strawmanning mate. You’re bringing up things that have never existed on the “main stream/blizzlike” servers.
---
Actually your first point is topical though seeing as Classic is 1.0 content with 1.12 talents and balance.
---
I’m thinking about rolling a new character, I have a 60 in kirtonos and it sucks because its so horde dominated to the point where I can’t enjoy world pvp. Benediction or Kromkrush?
---
It is known.
---
This doesnt even sound real lmao. Horde Zepps are usually attached to Horde territories where Alliance cant attack unless they are attacked first unlike Alliance ships that are not attached to towers/in the air and are only in contested Low level zones with no guards. They cant camp Zepps since there are guards immediately attached to them in ports AND if you let it zone itll bring you to a Horde zone where Alliance cant attack you.   
---
You also mentioned 25% alliance with " death squad 5 mans " ???? Hardly a threat especially when you mentioned 75% of the realm is Horde and you can just zerg a 5 man no matter how good they are in PVP.
---
Israel?
---
Horde-Stalagg here. I keep hearing "Horde are the bad guys, fuck those dudes/dudettes,!" And yet whenever I run to BRM, I only see Alliance camping. This isnt solely a Horde problem. When you run 3 times the server limits of vanilla, both sides are gonna wanna min max. Horde catches a lot of flack for all WPvP situations, when both sides are guilty.
---
1. He said 1-60, not raiding. It is mostly inconsequential for 1-60, or outside of raiding.
---
2. The glancing glow penalty decrease caps at +8, with the jump from +5 to +8 being largely inconsequential, so rogues don't really need the racial as much, particularly since daggers catch up to swords in AQ and surpass them in Naxx, and there's no racial for daggers.
---
Orcs also get +5 to axes so for warriors it's very close between orc and human.
---
People are probably already farming their damage-type wands for Chromaggus, and frost weps for AQ 40. 
---
and hunters will also bring shittier green-item bows for Nefarian, so that if they break their bows you don't have to set up a repair bot every after every wipe
---
/train emote got me 😂
---
I was advocating Changing the toxic honor system here in this sub months before release. What did I get? Downvoted every post. Every suggestion post by me or others shot down. At least they're doing cross realm bgs.   
---
O well, we get what we asked for... No changes
---
haha well ur a winner man gj
---
Yes, exactly. Those things never existed in vanilla, but existed on private servers. So they're not "more like vanilla" than classic is.
---
Why wouldn’t there be lol? Plus who said they’re a thing? I’m just trying to say they’re not that bad. Also, you haven’t answered why you’re getting so defensive. Bad memories from that bracket?
---
It's realistically not 10g, because there's always people there. If you're the only one there than yes. 1 other person there and you're down to 5g an hour, and having only 1 other there is rare
---
Shitty and low effort memes have ruined both :/
---
Nothing you said contradicts me? The horde and alliance raids rarely were in the same phase so they were picking off solo players and Mythic Plus 5 mans.
---
On EU Zandalar Tribe RPPVP, even though the server is only 55-45 alliance favoured plenty of Hordies have threatened to transfer servers due to the PVP disparity. I just hope the ratio doesn't slip to even more Alliance favoured.
---
Yeah for sure. Its sad but maybe its time to stop playing :)
---
This is my main gripe other than the 1.12 talents and balance making the game piss easy at the moment. Worth a read. I’ve experienced most of this but comes down to the mobs and game just not feeling like vanilla, but the private servers handled these issues and/or fixed them.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/general-mob-behavior-and-flee-mechanics/287281

Yeah this is what I want as well, population issues wont be bad and copying rather than transferring will incentivize playing both
---
Afaik no official information has been released other than there will be battlegroups
---
I made about 800g farming shadowfang keep with holy nova, practice it, get more efficient, and grind it out. I got 2 assassins blades and 2 shadowfangs
---
Yeh ... I’m sure they are worried about the #nochanges crowd too.
---
Part of me thinks ion hazzyman is sitting in his lair twirling his strap-on mustache saying “you thought you did but you don’t”
---
More crying, the tears are delicious.
---
Whats the difference between someone who abandoned their pop disadvantaged server in favor of a server with the population in their advantage; and a person who just won't give up their faction imbalance advantage in the first place? Its the same picture.
---
Amen.
---
Gear and optimization doesn’t really even matter until BWL and Nax. 
---
It sucks to hear but all those guides out there saying you “have to use” x item or whatever is probably a good item but I wouldn’t take it as gospel.

Oh no a new model, I have to hate on it

Didnt know I needed to have one to point out a bad one
---
These are handplayed venezuelan &amp; egyptian goldfarmers. You can tweet the names to JagexWeath on twitter and he will get rid of them.
---
I mean I leveled alliance so yea lol. 30 mins is a long streak for most 30+ zones
---
I'm a Blizzard fanboy, and will probably be forever. I played majority of their games (incl. stuff like Blackthorne) and will probably check out Diablo 4 when it comes out.
---
But, you're right. It always a great start, and then a sharp drop-off.
---
(In the Arms of an Angel plays while the camera cuts to images of crying gnomes, dwarves, night elves, and humans) 
---
Please, sponsor these innocent, helpless Alliance players. They can’t make it without your generosity.
---
Just like everyone else is just saying they ban in waves. Everyone's talking out of there ass based on anecdote and have no idea how the banning in classic currently works
---
Not for organized premade PvP
---
Interesting mechanics. We use the wall at the back so the run distance is halfed basically. I've never seen it done this way.
---
  just hit level 46 on my orc warlock and now I can't do anything. I go to gadget.. dead. not even allowed to HS or take flight path away, I just get mind controlled back. I go to felaris and get killed 2 sec after leaving the in by 5 level 60. I fly to azhara and get killed at the FP. I don't even see the point in playing anymore. I know I rolled on a PvP server but god damm.
---
Pretty sure it was a group of 3 friends but ah well. Alls good, ran Strat another 4 times this morning and finally have the robes.
---
&gt; But as others say, I do not either trust Blizzard with this idea
---
I don't like 2019 Blizzard either. But I already know that I will probably quit if they decide on TBC (I played it recently, and I don't like how much it changes the game).
---
So from my PoV the chance is probably worth it to me, as its a chance to improve the product that I like, as opposed to forcing me into a product I don't like.
---
Or maybe they will do the character transfer stuff and split up the playerbase into multiple versions of the game, but that doesn't seem like a good idea imo, where there are like 3 and then 4 versions of WoW all cannibalizing each other.
---
Thank you a lot! Gonna remember that info!
---
Only in the game world where retail is instanced. The login servers themselves still all have the same capacity to show “full” status. Difference is when you login on Classic and it says full. That means 5-10k is all that can log in. Whereas in Retail, when it says full, it reaches the same capacity then offloads the rest of the players to another instance/login server.
---
Epic daggers should go to rogues...
---
Not that warriors can’t make good use over them, just that rogues have better use of daggers as a whole and using their primary weapon weakens their loot pool
---
This happened to me, but on a horde dominated server. 23 deaths to get into BRD. 12 before the entrance of the mountain. Well over an hour just to get into the instance.
---
It does get repetitive i would agree, those to me have always just been a grind
---
Needs more chopper...
---
why are you gonna block me? tell me why or else i cant improve myself
---
If only the Alliance put this much effort into organizing in-game!

Jabroni and iWolf, you can find multiple comprehensive BiS lists from the warrior discord (fightclub).

I interpreted “wasn’t in the same scale like you said” as you telling me that I said it was the same scale. My bad.
---
Care to explain why? Prove using numbers? I am genuinely curious
---
I don't believe you. How did they all get R14 and have the time to progress naxx?
---
I found a handful in shimmering flats (like 6-7, a few on each faction). I found 2 in northern dustwallow swamps. I found two in southern barrens (lvl 18-20 ish), I found two in southern alterac by the cats and defias areas (lvl 25-29 ish). There are some in random places in stranglethorn usually where big masses of mobs are e.g. one bot killing raptors. Benediction USE server.
---
Boots are most often troll hunters with an autogenerated name and a pet with 2 Chinese characters as a name. Usually it will be a pig, but not always. I have encountered one orc rogue bot, 2-3 troll mage bots, 2 gnome mage bots, 1 orc Hunter bot. Everything else was a troll hunters with the Chinese pet name.
---
I'm pretty sure this is what Blizz will do once Classic's first run is through.
---
Maybe release more "seasonal" servers every 2-3 years so that people can start classic anew, some MMOs do this quite successfully, but always keep permanent servers up as well while also releasing TBC and allowing character copies.
---
Or they'll just keep Classic on Naxx forever and open TBC with copies. Who knows?
---
A few years ago I made a Tauren Monk named Owatanka, which means Brewbull in the Tauren language.  Turns out that's also the name of a thunder lizard in The Barrens.

Im still waiting on baron bind and have started the bar grind, hope it drops :(

No. You want cross servers, I dunno, go to the game with cross servers.
---
community wise? I don't rly agree on that,  but the gameplay of pservers was just way better than classic

Ok I thought the image was showing some way to tell they were betting just from the /who list
---
Yes, your use of capslock *did* indicate you are quite upset...
---
Rum ham.
---
Every server has many people with multiple accounts. It is VERY common. Lots of single millennials with good jobs, cash to burn, and crippling wow addictions.
---
And that's why your mom is in a fucking wheel chair
---
I'm also a fan of milksteak :P
---
&gt; People are still debating wheter alliance is better in raiding or in organized PvP in classic
---
Not fully, Alliance wins the "Raiding more easily" department . Paladins are *broken* whereas Shaman are just pretty good in 1.12. If this were "Windfury can proc itself" times, then yeah, it'd be up for debate, but the Threat blessing alone and the crazy singletarget heals of Paladins make Alliance a good bit stronger in PVE. You can still absolutely demolish raids as horde, but tanking especially is a good bit tougher for Horde. Random WF procs by Warriors can cause occasional chaos, whereas Alliance just has a smooth ride all throughout.
---
For PVP it's up for debate I'll somewhat agree with that, but most topend tryhard PVP guilds tend to play Alliance just so they can be gnomes. Escape artist is *really* good.
---
“Innocent” lol killing players for honor isn’t evil, it’s how the system works and doing it in IF is efficient if you can do it.
---
Haven't heard that name in a long time.
---
If you zone in from STV to silverpine or durotar you will keep your pvp flag and can be attacked. If you fly in from a pvp zone and run out to the zep before your pvp flag has dropped then you can be attacked.
---
This shit is getting to be worse than the solution to layering posts pre-launch. Just stop.
---
pretty sure the next thing you are going to do is brag about how you were glad every season or some bullshit like that.  
---
If you wanted pvp to be skill based you would be asking for gear equalization, where all your fancy equipment amounted to skins in pvp...but no you need a specific stat that gives you an advantage against those who don't have it.
---
i wouldnt call that much of a 2v1 though when theres like 7 mobs on the priest.
---
I dont understand these stupid ass posts showing off something good you and many other people have. Its just an invitation for people to come over and mess things up
---
That's a funny way of saying 'I can't use rage pots'
---
This was the first wipe ever @ Baron. We pull him back with a hunter pet and fight there. Works even better to do it as you guys do it, all ranged stacked up and just run half the distance, but whatever we clear MC and Ony in 1 raid night, games become booring. So we play for these funny moments 😂
---
You do know what forum you are in right?
---
I'd get pretty bored pretty quickly without any alliance to fight out in the world. It's a lesser experience than even PVE realms.
---
You're not stupid and it doesn't make you look stupid.
---
                            
---
It's completely unacceptable what has happened to you and the idea that rerolling should be an option you consider is laughable. Blizzard need to offer you a valid solution.
---
The problem is by the time they're banned they've brought in 1-5000g into the economy.
---
Mortal strike uses 1 from the mob's debuff slot (16 by default afaik) so there will be 1 less of dot on the monster if u use mortal strike
---
I’m just sayin a 30-0-21 build is way way better because you get natures swiftness while only sacrificing the boomkin form itself
---
How does playing on a server some how make you trash... do these people even for a minute think of how stupid that comment is? Like for as many decent players are Faerlina that server probably also has the biggest amount of genuinely bad players.
---
To be fair, I'm not surprised warrior dps die a lot. They are rogues with zero survivability. Maybe can cheese a debuff every half hour with shield Wall, however that's it
---
Thinking about getting into Classic instead of Retail, leveled up a couple of characters up to around 20ish,  but wanted to just start fresh and going in between a warlock or a priest. Wanted to do more BG's then PVE content, since Getting into raids and schedules is a little hard for me. Any decent servers that are nice place to start for Alliance? Also, what are some great addons / ui's for leveling / in general.
---
Resault
---
Wow, I feel like this post could have been summarized much more concisely, but yeah, they called it! That’s just the classic meta at this point
---
When you see a random screenshot on reddit and it's your guild. oO
---
Im on Rattlegore and Its apparently 40ally-60 Horde. But regardless of how many horde or ally there are it all depends on how many want to fight and group. It feels like Alliance will and can group but Horde naturally are out there hunting. And it makes sense. Most people rolled Horde to PVP because of their strong racials.
---
Your brain has probably retained only useful information since raiding Naxx
---
Funny coming from the one who brought it up in the first place.
---
doubt it, they'll have to do something in their hour long queues.
---
Strange, because I actually played Vanilla and Horde outnumbered Alliance on almost every PvP server, especially EU and ones that weren't launch servers. Tich was the most famous PvP server in the game and that was hugely, hugely horde population dominated.
---
Everyone in Vanilla knew how OP Horde racials were, and everyone in every stage of the game since has seen the population Horde gets because of those racials.
---
You signed up for EZmode, there's not really any point pretending otherwise.

Dude can you seriously fuck off telling people to reroll?

You're just spamming these threads talking about the 'sunk cost fallacy' as if you understand it. For a start, it rests on the assumption that it is right or fair to expect blizzard to do nothing for the alliance stuck on Flamelash and that their characters are dead and useless and that's the way its meant to be.
---
Not wanting to repeat content without having experienced end game has **nothing** to do with sunk cost.

&gt; ... really I most prefer a blood elf.

This is exactly the reason i chose Horde. Used to play dwarf paladin in vanilla and wanted to experience the other side of the coin this time around

The OP is using Leatrix Plus.
---
Well we got the don't part down. It's the play the game part we are trying to figure out.
---
Uh... not even 6 years ago Alliance was heavily dominant in PVP because of how powerful it was to have alliance racial trinket + 2 damage trinkets equipped and because of how strong this was even classes that couldn't be human would switch to alliance to play with others. How do people not remember this?? There was a period between Wrath all the way to WoD where Alliance was the dominant PVP race by a long shot. On Retail this can still be fixed.. on Classic it cannot unless they break the rule of no change.

You dont have to go full prot but you can go mostly prot if you're solely set on tanking dungeons for leveling and no questing. Grabbing 5/5 cruelty in fury,  5/5 deflection 5/5 tact mastery 1/1 anger management in arms, and 5/5 one handed weapon spec in prot will greatly increase your dmg and negate any rage starve problems. You can throw the rest of your points in prot and play around as long as you get shield slam, 5/5 defiance, 1/3 imp shield block and last stand.

&gt;Why werent transfers offered earlier to balance unbalanced realms?  
---
If the overall population of H:A is say 100:70, where are the excess horde supposed to go? Or alliance for that matter?  You get a situation like Heartseeker because all Alliance want to abandon ship, which makes sense.  How are you ever going to have healthy balances on servers where there are so many more horde spread across all servers?  Even counting Heartseeker, there's still WAY more horde overall.  It's not possible to balance it.  
---
The **players** could fix this if they wanted to in about 1 second.  A lot of Horde would have to reroll as Alliance (not going to happen but would fix the problem).  Alternatively Blizzard *could* allow Horde to xfer to alliance like they do on retail and if full horde guild were willing to faction swap, that could also solve it (players aren't going to do this).  So again it's up to the players to balance the numbers because Blizzard doesn't have great options with overall imbalances being this bad.  No, faction queue is not the answer.

You need to read this thread again and stop being so emotional. Never once have I claimed anything other than the difference between PvE and PvP servers.

Since you decided to say I was a scrub, I’m going to go ahead and tell you what it means. It’s someone who, when presented with the rules of a game, invents their own rules in addition — maybe they think it’s more fair or less cheesy their way. The problem is that they are the only one playing by them. 
---
There is exactly one rule in WoW PvP, and that is “if you’re flagged, the other faction can attack you”. That’s it. Anything else to do with class balance, or faction balance, or honour in the non-points sense, is invented by the player and is not a rule of the game.
---
So horde ruining that server too eh?  I think they the only to curve a majority of this is to lower honor outside of bgs to next to nothing to get people to stop.
---
Lol like it's the fault of players that decided to do wpvp in the wpvp patch that 20 guilds decided to move? My server is pretty horde favored yet everyone is still there. Maybe alliance took a few deaths before entering UBRS wow big deal, you had 3 months to do these dungeons and you will have no problem going back into them once BGs are out and every ranker waits for queues.
---
People need to grow up.
---
She only does the breath when she will hit a certain number of people. If your raid spreads properly she won’t breath at all in p2
---
So you threw it out on the pile of kodo corpses. Thats cold
---
Lmfao man this is great!
---
Indoctrination from a young age.
---
DIDN'T MAKE SENSE NOT TO GRAVEYARD RUN
---
RESURRECT NOW AND GET GANKED A TON
---
Nobody likes those streamers who think they are the chosen ones. The guys who are in it to be a face are totally self aggrandizing and create the toxicity
---
Thats easy to see for yourself. Based on login server status per realm. More servers at high to full capacity = more players than fewer servers capped at 10k players before a queue. Classic is about 20% of the total WoW base. Still a lot of players. Just not as much as retail. Classic has a content wall. Whereas Retail has challenging mechanics and more competitive challenges.
---
If you wanted pve to be skill based you would be asking for gear equalization, where all your fancy equipment amounted to skins in raiding... 
---
oh, wait, you DON'T want that? Same "cake and eat it, too" crap that raiders wanted to stay in the game after classic. If you wanted tbc pvp gear you could have spent 2 hours a week and gotten it. Not sure why you are so mad about it
---
Most of the problems people have with PvP currently are tied pretty strictly to being on PvP servers
---
Essence of the firelord
---
horde dont understand*
---
You got so mad you attempted to mock me? That's sad...
---
Flying was dope. You want to spend MORE time while grinding? Gtfo.
---
Which again, has always been dominated by alliance thanks to paladins. Why are we still talking about this?
---
I find I can use fbolt for half of phase 1 and then wand and I regenerate to full by end of phase 1
---
&gt; Is this your logic?   
---
You asked a specific question I responded to. I never defended shitty behavior.   
---
If you feel the need to argue and there is no room for discussion, move on. My point is you will not fix anything in those situations. At best you will waste your own time. Focus where you can make progress. There is no point in trying to develop some online mind control that doesnt exist. I am hardly being argumentative. To prove that point Ill be moving on to other things. Hope this was constructive for you.
---
Okay.
---
Single / duo combat zones. Can't attack a player if he's already engaged by another 1 or 2, etc
---
I still believe that more dots is fake news. DB is likely random.
---
take a break until bgs come out, you probably need one anyway and playing right now isn't worth it.
---
I do that as well.  Sometimes just hard to commit that block of time that a dungeon would require.  Lately I have sucked it up and have done a few more dungeons but I do enjoy questing more still.
---
I had to open 3 times on an orc rogue few days ago. I questioned my life.
---
Wish the pvp wasn t cross realm :P that would be even funnier :D
---
What?
---
I just googled flushing, should probably start doing that!
---
I could see it, I probably could’ve worded it better.
---
That's only assuming you can get (and win) a steady stream of 1v1 fights, which I gather is pretty hard to make happen on PvP servers for either faction at the moment, and requires some actual dueling skill. Much easier to set up camp at flight paths or around quest/dungeon hubs and just kill anything that comes into your sights.
---
Well they aren't really for certain classes. They are all just cloth sets with varying amount of int/spi/stam. If you are going to wear 4 of them any way then you may as well get the same one for set bonus.
---
It’s cool, I misinterpreted it. Twas my bad.
---
Seal of vengeance iirc.
---
I was wrong seal of the martyr is the alliance equivalent.
---
Im 298 sword skill from ony runs. I blast p2 tho
---
Sunk cost fallacy doesn't really apply here IMO.
---
It would apply if someone was crazy enough to continue playing on Flamelash.
---
I played the game and had fun... and now, in order to continue having fun with what I've created, I'll have to recreate it from scratch. Almost sounds like a **bug**, doesn't it?
---
..
---
Imagine your totally fine server gets flooded by massive amounts of crybabies and carebears who where too fregile to make it on their own server and now ruining yours.
---
In a thread of people crying about pvp while refusing to reroll on a pve server. LOL
---
Kromkrush has more horde and it's very obvious in places like black rock mountain but when you go to places like winter spring or feralas it's a lot more 5v5 or 10v10
---
No he's not right. Yeah if you're getting spawn camped that blows but if I got ganked every 30 minutes if be rightfully pissed.
---
That was a fix to "up the challenge" that just made gearing up suddenly feel worthless.  Fix one thing, break two more.
---
&gt;The honor system isn't FORCING you to be toxic sociopaths! You CHOSE to do that, just as the child chose to destroy his toy.
---
You clearly don't understand the honor system or how it works if you think that. The reason shit heads are camping instances and flight paths is because it is by a wide margin the fastest way to progress through the honor ranks...
---
By your logic blizzard also doesn't force you to do quests or get better gear sure it's vastly easier and way faster to get to 60 if you do quests but there not forcing you to do any.
---
Well, there are really three options that are going to happen.
---
1. They never update Classic wow beyond Naxx, pretty unlikely
---
2. They just throw BC and WOTLK onto Classic over the next couple of years, pretty likely, basically free money, very little dev time required.
---
3. Develop new content for Classic, to deviate from BC/Onward
---
Since it's likely they'll eventually put wotlk in, saving your base mount in the bank, to be "learned" as in added to your mount collection later, isn't out of the question.
---
How do they know who is from flamelash?
---
Rather quit the game than stoop down to that
---
Northdale and lightbringer would peak at about 10-12k concurrent users daily,  and go even higher on patch days.
---
Ive not called anyone a sociopath?
---
&gt;likely
---
It is. There is no mechanic that influences it.
---
Hi everyone! My wife and I just created an undead warlock and priest. I'm not entirely new to wow but might as well be. My wife is new to MMOs in general. So I'm going to be playing the priest and she is going to play the warlock. We don't care about pvp so really need suggestions on two pve builds for us. Leveling mostly, idk how much raiding we will do but plan to do dungeons. Any help would be greatly appreciated everyone!
---
&lt;private server player detected&gt;
---
Btw I have in game evidence I played in vanilla, unlike most people.
---
Thanks, this is great. I’ve started following it! Surprised there’s no Arathi but oh well.
---
Interesting. I've seen a hunter like that on Kromkrush but nothing stood out as odd to me at the time. 
---
Although... He didn't try to kill me on sight so I guess that should have been a clue.
---
I transferred a 41 lock orc i abandoned, from flamelash to ES. I spent 75 minute in DMarsh and met a single alliance mage, wtf?   
---
On the other hand, my 60 guildies told me Kargath is under permanent siege, so there\`s that.
---
not true its totally random
---
Because it isnt actually a problem worth addressing
---
I've never seen this happen personally but I agree with these suggestions. You should not be able to gank people that have JUST taken the rez sickness debuff. If someone takes rez sickness, they should have the "right" to hearth out.
---
I definitely think you'll see things go back to a near-normal. Of course there's going to be hotspots of world pvp, compared to before the honor system got released, but bg's will be the way to go for those who care about honor.
---
Two SGC in 70 runs? I hate you... I've done somewhere in the ballpark of 150-200 runs and I've only seen Gorosh spawn 5 times. Never dropped the chest.
---
It's not like Libram of Focus costs any relevant amount.
---
Onyxia and all the MC bosses were nerfed multiple times between 1.1 and 1.12, ony’s fireball not doing a conflag, garr not detonating adds, nerfed rag damage are just a few I can think of
---
What did they ninja
---
I was just replying to the guy who said levelling isn’t hard.
---
It's like an abandoned mall from the mid 90's.
---
Not on a PvP server?
---
Its because there were not enough servers to accommodate everyone, so they were all overcrowded.
---
They did start working on Wow2 in a sense was Titan and we know the story of that game.
---
You do realize you can’t get hk’s in battlegrounds, right? And that battlegrounds are cross-realm?
---
Incorrect. I have a hunter alt, have used the addon to target a rogue just as they go onto stealth. If I time it right, my pet can (and has) chase them down and smack them.
---
I made an alt on a PvE server for when the ganking becomes too much.
---
Not everybody on the server is one of those hardcore PvP'ers who corpse camp or snack people in IF. Should these people be punished to?
---
To clarify I am not playing on one of those imbalanced servers, I am just interested in discussions like this.
---
&gt; make their own Countries great again
---
WAY easier said than done
---
I want tbc to come out but I also want classic to remain untouched for all time.
---
I made a post recommending something like this and everyone shat on my post, /cry
---
People used wpvp as a justification for toxic griefing...that won't change.
---
Ah never seen the thumbnail, I thought that was a quest item?
---
The way people act in a video game *does not* have anything to do with being a sociopath. A key element of being a sociopath is seeing other people as things rather than people with feelings. 
---
In a video game (especially one where you literally cannot speak with your enemy), they're already depersonalized.  Basically everyone who plays video games also plays violent video games. Murdering NPCs is no different than murdering a player character. 
---
They're not people in the context of a video game. They're a thing, an avatar. 
---
Just because you go on a killing spree in a video games doesn't indicate anything  about your mental state. This is not to say that certain personalities are not more likely to grief than others, but it doesn't have anything to do with being a sociopath.
---
Comparing corpse campers to sociopaths is just bad mojo. You shouldn't label people like that.
---
Leveling boost isnt pay to win, its skip the pointless part of the game.
---
since honor resets on wednesday, it would mean a full day (or evening/night/morning) of bg farming, which will easily result in more honor than the 6 days of wPvP nets you combined.
---
Good job dude. It would be nice to know how to code or use blueprints better so I could so something like this.
---
I did the ragnaros raid thing a while back with ue4  [https://www.artstation.com/artwork/8lD30E](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/8lD30E)
---
Unless you have a premade ready to go on tuesday, you´re the one whos brain is fried.
---
Unless you can actually compete with the top percentage of players, you just wasted time farming pittance of honor for nothing.
---
Hope not that would be ridiculous
---
Incendius is like this as well. First 2 weeks of p2 were dead even faction balance, last I checked a couple days ago it was tipped Ally favor like 56/44
---
there are more posts about Flamelash being dead than there are Alliance players on Flamelash
---
Oop, fun police arrived
---
Did this guy think he was getting a BL every hour on the dot? It's a dynamic (45-75 minute) spawn time across 10 nodes and this person made a reddit post. "...empty his bags." Does he think he has hundreds of black lotus lol?
---
Re roll for sure.
---
I am noggenfogger as well and I will give you a boost to get you going
---
Ions gang.
---
Guess what: someone can pay $$$ for people to find you and kill your character on sight every time on PVP server when you are flagged. I wonder how does it make you feel.
---
Possibly less if you’re winning a lot and it’s AV weekend.
---
Id imagine it will get better tuesday - maybe take a bit of time to do stuff irl while you wait? If its not better then likely your best bet is to reroll. The break will make that a little easier also because its a few less days you committed to trying.
---
Who said shit about ret? lol. Nobody takes ret seriously. Reckoning is far superior if you have half a brain.
---
Ele shaman can burst for about 5 seconds and is easily countered
---
Though, reading must be hard given I excluded range.
---
Heal build can even run rocking for high burst when they get focused, Unlike a resto shaman
---
Except you dont understand the difference of what was gained from people who abused the loan system versus a fucking game.
---
As a Horde it was always hard for me to understand Alliance culture. What was fascinating for me is that they like bragging about their freedom which was weird for me, because I didn't think that I have any less freedom than them. I always thought 'What is the difference'. However after this game I finally understand it. Alliance is just so fucking free.
---
I picked up a high intellect set of gear  for lasher farming, it's a mix of random gear from the AH and blues that were passed on in dungeons.
---
&gt; Pserver=/=vanilla
---
you are right pservers where overall the better product
---
Gutterspeak to anybody who doesn't speak it is the exact same as alliance&gt;horde. So anything alliance can say to hordes, Undeads can too. Only issue being that you can't macro gutterspeak, so you have to manually copy paste.
---
What do you mean "empty his bags"? He gets 2-3 lotus per day if he misses none. At that rate he's emptied his bags like once assuming he's been doing this since day 3 or 4 of classic release.
---
On his faction on my server, they go for around 50g each, sometimes 60. Even at 2 a day that's 100g minimum a day just for having a second sub, and most likely more. He dominates his factions AH, I'd be surprised if he wasn't averaging 4-5 BL sales a day.
---
yikes
---
honestly, I hope you're right.
---
you can macro it, that's how i say it. "/run SendChatMessage("AL AM DP AL AM DP Ω Í X Ģģ Í ή X Y P AL AM DP", "YELL", 33)" in Gutterspeak says "LO VE ME LO VE S A Y TH A T Y O U LO VE ME"
---
For me it was the “g o T o RE T a IL” from the one horde in a large killsquad, really hit home from the Stalagg days
---
[Video](https://youtu.be/n826_1Kxwvo?t=15) of this post.
---
I'm horde on benediction and it sometimes honestly feels like alliance have the majority. Definitely a great server.
---
He doesn't just hoard them, I'm not saying they're overflowing, just that he heads to town to empty what he got.
---
Edit: there are also a couple other herb spawns in the same area that can be gathered without fighting.
---
Do you have a good prot/holy spec? thanks!
---
Why?
---
Activision fucked them up good. They are in it for the money, and money only.
---
It means that anyone who is ranking needs to spend the entire Tuesday night farming bgs until the reset wed morning because of how honor efficient they are
---
LMAO horde fucked themselves, have fun doing AQ months after everyone else
---
Welp, just how wrong your responses are reaffirmed that nothing you say is indicative of top tier gameplay, so I am just going to say I hope you're alliance so I can come for that ass come BGs
---
My first thought
---
Titan? I've never heard of it. Is there any links or anything so I can have a look?
---
You can’t rely on the threat meter, no. The best thing to do is white hits only phase 1, wands and auto attacks. Phase 2 is burst. Then literally do nothing as she’s landing for phase 3 unless you’re supposed to be fighting for threat. Anyone who pulls better be running to the tank spot. A good lead will allow MT like 10s before they call for dps to finish her. If you pull off the MT after they have it in p3 you’ve fucked up unless she’s low and you’re desperate to down her.
---
Hardest part BY FAR of having a successful Ony is allowing threat to be established following phase 2. And for that you can’t rely on the meter
---
This dead server must be doing it very right then
---
Been there. Feel your pain. Had a 57 priest beat me (a warlock) on briarwood reed yesterday.
---
What no. I love my mega server atm
---
You aren't fooling anyone.
---
Anything used in important flasks/hp and mana pots/rage pots/ fire resist pots/etc. People will be using a lot more of that as they progress through BWL. I made a separate bank alt just for herbs and have just been stockpiling everything I farm up on my main.
---
Lmao you are pathetic. Even Reckoning is absolutely not reliable and not competitive in Premades.
---
they literally just sit there (most likely alt tabbed) until their spy addon tells them that an honor pinata is near then they tab back in, for what seems like 8+ hours a day
---
it's kinda sad
---
Those are after 2.0 itemization changes and are not truly vanilla.
---
This was mid day on a saturday.
---
That's still 100 guilds, which is much more than 23.
---
Fun thing is Shadow Priest and Boomkin aren't even really meme specs, if you find players who are dedicated to playing that class and they get the gear they need for pre-BiS and then get raid pieces, they are solid. Obviously not Fury War or Frost Mage levels of dps but still capable and bring utility. People just like hating on things because other people tell them they should hate on things. It's silly.
---
&gt; No arena? Wtf would I do all day then?
---
More interesting pvp with strategic objectives, rather than just glorified duels?
---
&gt;  There was plenty of people that actually liked it, my man
---
Okay, how about this: no arena as exclusive method of obtaining good pvp rewards.
---
My real issue is that it's ridiculous to have the best pvp rewards gated behind the most simplistic pvp. I'd be fine even with arena being _one_ way to obtain rewards, but it certainly should not be the only.
---
I don’t think people understand the term anymore lol, that or it’s the “ I’m not triggered you responding to me is triggered!”
---
30 minutes lol. On alliance you you can't go 5 seconds
---
Easy answer is that most people have long out-leveled SFK. Those running alts usually skip it due to it's location and because it's a bitch to power-level people through (mobs with magic immunity buffs and buggy spawns) . Much easier to spam SM carries from 20-45.
---
Kinda feel like this is a way to farm karma...
---
Lmao trying to trick players to play their dead server
---
Kick him. And then promptly re-evaluate why this process involves the votes of 13 (practically 1/3rd of a 40 man raid) people.
---
I'd bet he got most of that gear during BC because of the fact that he had an ashbringer.
---
Found the triggered horde
---
This is absolutely acceptable in Blizzards eyes. As for the players, this behavior is something that could get you blacklisted. It's not petty to inform LFG about players that need on their off spec group and depending on the batch of players that message reaches, usually you end up doing the rest of us a favor. It helps to know who I should avoid running with so that I dont get ripped off either.
---
Do you not have eyes? Raid gear is easy to spot without inspection
---
How?
---
Played from vanilla to mist and came back for about a month per expansion after that. Played BFA for a few months just cause I had that wow itch. Haven’t touched retail 1 bit since classic launched. Found an amazing server with an even better community and a guild that has been the best thing since I was raiding in wrath with a guild of mostly irl friends. Yeah I get ganked a lot (holy pally) sometimes camped but all in all this is the most fun I’ve had playing WoW in years and I don’t plan on stopping anytime soon.
---
Let's not forget that the greater concern at the time was to do with the other massive difference - layering - which put concerns about server sizes in the back seat.
---
And, well, private server folks always chimed in that "We had X thousands of players on Y server so it's gonna be fine".
---
This assumes filthy Horde can get girls
---
By accident*
---
The vast majority of my guild played thru wotlk.
---
None of us plan to sub for it.
---
Even yellow hits can proc it and generate more rage + the hit itself which scales as you get gear. It's BiS until phase 5 for a reason.
---
Rogues are easy for warriors so that's a trivial point
---
PvE servers are Alliance dominated. They don't get much attention, but they will even things out.
---
I don't mind. The more it gets complained about, the more visible it is.
---
Thats cheap. Id hoard them at that price. Will skyrocket when bwl hits I guess. 1 lotus is 100g on my server now.
---
Only if the fury warrior is well geared.
---
I think PvP server pops matter a lot, so they get attention. Nobody is paying attention to the Alliance dominated PvE servers.
---
It's also the expansions universally known for bringing the end time to wow. After this expansion, shit went down hill fast!
---
Aoe silence was also a winner over Alliance too
---
Actually its the alliance ruining the server now.
---
Go back to Fortnite please.
---
Can confirm he helps you and sends these items. This guy is a legend! Thank you again.
---
If “casual” is an insult, you live a sad existence.
---
1.1*
---
Depressing that this is downvoted but then again this sub is mostly RPers and normies so..
---
The burden of proof is not on me to "prove" a fact but since your too lazy to find out what month were achievements released? October. See if you can at least find out what month wrath of the lich king expansion was released?
---
There is a point where she stops targeting people and begins to lazily land that marks the end of phase 2. Unless you’re using any kind of DoT you can dps right up to this point as it is important to get through phase 2 quickly.
---
It’s also worth noting that highest dps should be on the opposite side as the healers and other dps. If they end up pulling, a tail swipe into the wall is much less lethal than a breath for your squishies. They can just run through ony between her legs after the tank has it as needed
---
What's the movie used in the vid?
---
WUDN'T it that there 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS and those GOD DAMN MILLENNIALS TOO (but mostly the millennials) that killed strip malls?  
---
Stupid millennials. They ruin everything.
---
Sunken cost fallacy. 
---
If rerolling means you'll enjoy the game more in the long run then you should do that. Just because you invest a lot of time into something doesnt mean you should continue putting more time into it if you're unhappy.
---
This sub has turned into a toxic cesspool filled with whining.
---
All i wanna say is daggers must always go to non-human rogues before anybody else can get them.
---
This is the eternal debate. Shadow Priest is so fun in PvP and ok for farming, but really dog in raids. The main thing spriests bring to a raid is the shadow weaving debuff, but the truth is that you could honestly have a disc priest spec into shadow instead of holy and go 31/0/20 and achieve the same thing, all while bringing more heals and a valuable cooldown (PI).
---
They quickly apply 5 stacks of the debuff with flay and then resume healing and PI a mage.
---
This level of minmax isn't required for MC necessarily, but it probably will be sometime in the future. I love spriests (I am disc but wish I could spec shadow), but they are really suboptimal. The argument is that there will be a wall that your guild hits for raiding at some point, and if they've split gear over a couple less optimal specs rather than gearing your max dps mages to the teeth, you're kinda screwing over the rest of the raid when it comes to progression.
---
This is the debate at least. I don't know where I fall on this spectrum exactly.
---
Downvoting me doesn’t change facts 
---
This sub has such a hateboner for private servers, it’s so dumb
---
I have all but abandoned my beloved Troll Priest because I can't kill anyone solo and we don't have enough PvPers in our guild (Most are raid loggers). I Hope BG's willl bring back the people I came to classic for, lest I go back to retail for some real raid mechanics.
---
Scuba Cops just can't accept reality, but even worse, they can't admit the facts. FACT: They failed at being the best guild on Anathema, but they justified their failure by claiming to be "best NA guild." FACT: Scuba failed at being #1 NA guild on Lightbringer, and justified it by having poor recruitment FACT: Scuba failed yet again on Northdale, and blamed their failure on "not practicing on PTR," despite their OWN GUILDLEADER CREATING A PRIVATE NAXX REALM to practice on. Scuba Cops just need to accept that they're not the best. There's nothing wrong with being a B+ Player, but there is a huge problem with a B+ Player pretending to be an A+ Player.
---
Also, I'm not even sure that's true. Orc stun resist and human perception are also fantastic against rogues. Overall, I think I'd rather have the human or orc racials than the dwarf racials for warrior.
---
I'm just glad Blizzard never believed in DotA cause they would have messed it up so bad lol
---
Valve ain't perfect but I can't think of a better company to handle it
---
Or, ya know, MULGORE, YOU PSYCHOPATH.
---
Well I can tell you from horde side a good amount of us have calm down on the world pvp not sure if it's because it just got boring to run around in a raid or because it just got boring running around looking for people. I personally enjoy world pvp but when it's an organic moment; not some organized world pvp BS just for farming honor. It's sad because people are destroying servers to race to rank 14 when in reality BG will be faster and funner competition wise. Side note if you rush rank 14 you have basically killed anything you have to do for a long time because that gear practically beats out BWL gear so have fun lvling your alts and having no goal other  than gearing an alt because your main will have nothing to do for a year other than dick around in BGs.
---
Almost there. PoE &gt; Diablo, won't ever buy that.
---
On my server it gives a pretty accurate representation of the population.
---
3 months to get to 55 but 25 euro not worth the transfer?  The fuck?
---
I think it has a more likely chance of farming bad karma on this sub.
---
I was about to. Then I saw your post.
---
I quit eve like 3 years ago. What happened?
---
you definitely do like Esfand
---
Doesnt matter what is good enough or isnt good enough for you lol. Players will decide whats best for them. if they dont like being camped in all of their GY's, boats and cities then they'll do something about it or quit.
---
Beating the armored dead horse really.
---
Completely agree. The entire sub is nothing but ironforge pictures and "horde bad alliance good" posts and comments. It's become unbearable.
---
Because nobody wants to waste weeks of playtime and start again, losing guilds, friends and having a new economy etc.
---
Youre being very obtuse about all of this. Nobody knew it was going to be this bad
---
No problem. One thing I forgot - once you get to Holy Shield, you can either go for Healing Light and Illumination in the holy tree, or Benediction, Improved Judgement and Improved Seal of the Crusader/Deflection in the ret tree. I'd personally recommend the first route, it gives you more utility.
---
As far as I know, a Naxx geared Warlock is easily some of the best PVE damage in Vanilla.
---
Have my upvote!!?
---
# HEY ALL FELLOW HORDE! HERE'S A NEW REALM TO PLUNDER FOR HONOR!
---
I guess level 2 then
---
Unironically this
---
I was up until this week. Shit luck on rich nodes (15 stacks - 0 arcanes) and have been unable to pvp this week because i need gold to get 30 sp to my staff of dominance. 
---
Other than farming - having a blast.
---
But that is the only real content in eve.  If anything it was pvpers being driven off by the horrible citadel mechanics that ccp was too slow to change.  When chaos era dropped the majority of the playerbase were people who farmed pve content 23/7.
---
Eve without a way to engage others in non-consensual pvp is all grind and no game.
---
Yeah we do.
---
Is it the horde spamming this sub with the same dumb jokes and nonstop crying?
---
Feels like the alliance are the ones upset, they also probably should have chosen a PvE server it's a better fit and resolves their issues.
---
Sure, for pve. PvP ends up what makes or breaks faction popularity. You'll still kill the boss, but it's always going to be annoying when that blood elf rogue can stun, kick, gouge and even aoe silence.
---
so which classes are currently good for the big group death packs? looking for something enjoyable
---
The only comparable trinkets are Blackhand's Breadth and Rune of the Guard Captain (if you're horde), and compared to those it either has 20 attack power or 1% more total damage (but since it can procc off of yellow attacks and give you rage, it's even better than crit or hit). That alone makes it worth it imo. For PvP it also offers unparalleled burst potential.
---
Personally I just put assholes on ignore.  Their name stays on the list there and i never have to talk to them again.  Simple.
---
It's faction specific, there can be zero alliance and horde can still get R14 without any issues.
---
its for rent.  
---
i've heard that a barber might be interested :-)
---
Rogues have nothing to stop the damage from the trash after Garr. Personally I let the stuns go out, then go in and that seems to help a ton.
---
I played wow when it first came out up till wotlk. I am truly amazed at the level of toxicity that player bases have developed over the years. 
---
At the risk of sounding old; back in my day killing people at the gy after they were corpse camped just wasnt done.
---
If anything this just makes the #nochanges crowd more laughable because most of the posts on here all touch on similar tones. Players have changed and games have to change with them.
---
Temporarily removed local chat from null as well as made changes to cyno.  Wasnt playing at the time, so I don't know exactly what the cyno changes were.
---
&gt; Don't blame players for wanting to play the game.
---
&gt; you, today: waaah waaah waaah I keep getting killed with zero death penalty beyond lost time.
---
Heh. You funny.
---
go to retail lmao
---
Here i am using every single button and even a couple spells missing. Damn shaman and their 20 something odd totems.
---
Maybe you did but I see people all the time looking for groups lol.
---
Thought it was about hord queues for BGs in a few days.
---
Horde player being rational and explaining what being triggered means
---
low iq dwarf: "hurr found the triggered horde hurrr durr"
---
Plaguelands are mostly alliance. Usually a band of them roaming. The nice thing too is they don't go too crazy and camp. At most I've been killed three times in a row before the entire group heads out to roam some more.
---
That's my guess. And this time all the allies that used to contest the flight paths will be in BGs all the time instead since they have instant queues. So half as many horde camping the flight paths, but no alliance to defend them.
---
He is, otherwise he wouldn't spam this sub with shit memes
---
You turn it in for the quest, but its a 100% drop item from Rag.
---
And you'd lose that target in a split second as they stealth. It would tell you when they rez but you know that already by looking at their corpse. If you want to cast something on them the moment they rez, you'd use a macro anyway because that's faster than clicking on the frame and casting.
---
Except it doesn't just procc off of white hits. It proccs off of all your yellow hits as well, including stuff like Hamstring.
---
maybe go to a pve server?
---
The narrative I got was small skirmishs during a tenuous peace.
---
It seemed a much stronger narrative of working together or at least not fighting for general world threats like Nefarion, kelthuzad and aq, complete with more background released for the pve baddies.
---
You need to use your full kit. Dont try to out rogue the rogue. Adapt to the opponent. CC and fight in range. Use bear to mitigate his melee damage when you want to finish the job. The only time I would be in kitty in this fight would be for a good opener but at your level you dont have one.
---
im pretty sure my dog jumping on my keyboard would play just as well as that warrior. maybe even better
---
I'm horde also. Alliance seems to have the more pvp oriented players and horde seems to want to do pve more but can group up and fight when they've had enough.
---
hHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA
---
I'm from earthshaker. I'm horde. The first impression, is now the major flamelash guild refugees are camping/raiding winterspring, brm, feralas, plaguelands etc. Wooptifuckingdo, I have a hard time feeling sorry for these ally cowards.
---
I'm having fun, found a decent guild of like-minded people who don't care to be try-hards but want to get things accomplished in raiding and pvp (not so much on the pvp but I can live with that).
---
I don't take anything on reddit seriously.
---
What is saying true and funny so I it’s just an assumption he’s mad
---
Although I don't rate WotLK as highly as Classic/TBC, I think the smartest thing to do would be to go the WotLK+ route when we get to that point. I think a majority of classic players draw the line before Cata.
---
Don't fight them in catform. Start the fight in cat and go bear ASAP.
---
When you are ~40-50% hp, try to get a bash off so you can shift out -&gt; root -&gt; heal yourself. Then go back bear and continue the fight. Worst case, you bash misses/resists, you can still shift + potion go back bear.
---
They will 100% outdamage you in cat, you need to outlast them in bear.
---
They certainly are the better players when it comes to defeating the easiest and most well known raid in the least amount of time, but that's about it. Picking the alliance as a faction makes that process even easier
---
Well I’m glad you found it helpful.
---
I just want to extend and say, you’re not wrong, there was a lot more to do back in the day.  Or at least it felt that way away. Not only did you have to farm pre-raid bis, but you had to get your shit enchanted, and had to have the gold to get that mats. You had to consume, but you had to have gold to buy the mats, or gold to buy the pots outright. Or if you had herblism, you had to go farm the mats, but before that, you had to take the time to level that profession. Come raid time you better have health pots, mana pots, resist sets and the like, which lead to farming. Not anymore. 
---
We now know the best farm spots, ways to make gold and know that most upcoming content is more of a mechanics check than a gear/dps check. This time around, we know ahead of time what’s coming. People are stocking up on supplies they won’t be using until naxx. Buying uncontested pieces that won’t be beneficial until AQ40.  Any farm spot for gold or resources is over farmed and camped, because we have the knowledge now. 
---
You’re getting bored because it’s easy now. Your bored because the game isn’t providing you the same experience. Not because the game has changed or the content, but the player base. We now have the knowledge of boss mechanics and and content ahead of time. We know what to expect, and we’re planning well in advance. We can min-max to our hearts desire, some guilds expect you to. This makes content and content preparation all the more easy. We don’t have to sit and camp the same handful of mobs for vendor trash to make gold because we know the best farm spots. We know the best classes, and which spec we should to playing, what talents we should to putting points into, and why. 
---
We have a much better understanding of the game. This is a 15 year old game that has had private servers around FOR YEARS. A lot of the community has had tons of time to practice, perfect their strats, leveling route, testing out different character, figure out the best farm spots, best professions, ways to level those professions, and what gear they should be aiming for. Back in the day, people thought going after the dungeon sets like magisters for example was the best thing you could get before raiding. Mages would walk into MC with magisters, thinking they were a boss. This world was so big, and open. So much to see, do and explore. Everyone was learning everything at the same time, and it was amazing. This time, the game feels boring and smaller because, well, most of that magic is gone now. We know too much, to the point of, unless you’re into pvp, you’ll become a raid logger very quickly after hitting 60. 
---
Point is, the game plays differently now because we play differently now. We are different now. When this was new, so were we. I ‘new timeline,’ is not going to change that.
---
In TBC, you also needed to PvE to get the best gear for PvP, tier 5/6 gear was significantly better than equivalent PvP gear for many classes, never mind weapons and trinkets where PvE gear was miles better.
---
Resilience only equalizes the playing field somewhat, you could still do arena in your normal PvE gear just fine, and it only took 10 games per week (trivial) in order to get some arena gear.
---
That complaint honestly reeks of "I should be able to stomp on everyone with my OP PvE gear" like is the case in vanilla.
---
PvE without Salvation. PvP without BoF.
---
Every time I see an alliance player cry on this sub about their decision to go with PvP and lack of research about what that entails, I gank a gnome
---
no
---
Isn’t that most of reddit nowadays?
---
You can buy your first mount at lvl40, however it is not that common to have the gold for it. It's 90g so you have to save up as much as you can while in your 30's and early 40's.
---
You don't spawn stealthed. If you macro /target and /cast dot, you will get them 10 times out of 10 if they don't rez outside of your range or LOS (which is countered by having multiple players).
---
It takes a while before that kicks in (read: MONTHS) happened previously on vanilla servers.
---
Not true, I can SW:P rogues reliably as they rez.
---
So it seems on the popular section :(
---
its metaphorical dude.... yikes.
---
I can see it now...
---
"Update: Alliance are now the dominant faction on Benediction with 60/40 or worse."
---
I talked about it awhile ago but people didnt seem to understand it. Faction imbalance can only be a problem solved if  blizzard is the sole entity fixing things. Its almost impossible to get an even 50/50 split on every PVP server because when youre taking horde away from one server youre giving them to another, vice versa. The best case scenario I can see is you maybe have every server being 55/45 or 45/55 with the odd one being 50/50 or something similar.
---
Why are you talking about warriors being in greens in a thread asking about raid dps?
---
Holy penis
---
Level 40 is the minimum level required for a mount, but you'll get Blink soon enough! It's something. ;)
---
In my opinion, when you start using flight paths more it doesn't feel as bad.
---
You severely underestimate the arsenal of equipment engineering possesses.  We’re strictly talking non twink locks? In an absolutely perfect scenario for a lock, like you suggest, yea they’ll be a little annoying but it won’t be enough damage and my health pool will def outlast their mana. Mana tapping is a bad idea since they already have little hp, it barely grants them mana anyway at that level. Just makes it easier for me to one hit them.
---
We can keep trading scenarios but it’s always different in game. It’s never a perfect scenario in game lol
---
DELETED!?
---
I still have mine in my bank. It's "RETIRED", and enjoying the easy life.
---
Depends on source, some have Alliance with more players overall.
---

---
Shift to bear !!! After you dump your energy on them shift over to bear and tank them down. Make sure you have thorns on as well. Don’t bash into evasion. Rouges are just tough to deal with getting stunned outside bear you just take to much damage .
---
Multiboxing is in general pay2win so yeah.
---
Well you can still PVP on PVE servers, you just choose to turn it on when you want to PVP. I would say PVP on PvE servers is better because everyone marked as PVP has chosen to do so, so you know you are not griefing anyone and no one is griefing you.
---
Oh no this awful pvp system got a little more awful for a day.
---
Faerie Fire (feral) isn’t available until later which really helps against rogues. Idk if at that level rogues are able to reset however. Bear form is a lot better against rogues as well with the increase armour and health.
---
If that doesn’t work, I would mute the rogue with roots and moonfire. Cat is just a stripped back version of a rogue, I do not recommend.
---
Mages eventually beat out Rogues but Warriors are tougher to beat. The main thing that changes for AQ/Naxx is raid composition. You bring less melee because there's just more stuff going on around the bosses that can kill melee. A typical AQ/Naxx setup has about twice as many mages and warlocks as an MC/BWL setup does.
---
The transfers closed on the 5th. The alliance players got stuck because they couldn't play during those two chaotic days of transfers before it closed.
---
Aww, don't leave us! The imbalance issue has gotten a little better because Horde transferred off. Alliance is pretty coordinated when it comes to pvp at lvl 60, much more than Horde. I think Fairbanks is getting better for the Alliance this week, and I think that trend will continue.
---
Salvation exists. Imagine going balls to the wall on DPS and not pulling aggro, like, ever. That's what Salvation does.
---
I did this for a ton of people new to my server (Horde side, but alliance dominated). Sadly, I don’t think but 5 still play (and they are mostly 60 now!). I don’t regret a thing.
---

---
I'm not saying you're wrong about using bloodthirst off cool down but instant attacks can proc HoJ or windfury which do reset the swingtimer.
---
back in the day this was 100% true. Now that people have finally figured out how to fury dps.... good luck. Back in the day fury was laughed at because no one figured out how to play one right. Now theres a few dozen guides that lay out the macros and explain how to play it and they are beast mode.
---
I mean this sub is used for low talent alliance players to vent their frustrations while horde are busy actually playing the game and not crying on Reddit.
---
Maybe softer personality types roll alliance, would be an interesting thing to survey
---
He walked right into that one
---
You're 52. Find 3 or 4 Mages and farm BRD.
---
Check out realm time zones so you can play on a west coast or east coast server for convince/lag...
---
Dunno if there is lag tbh on east coast VS west but I like matching my realm time
---
On the other hand, it was the expansion where subscriber growth stagnated and started to drop...
---
Loving life as a 41 warrior on Deviate Delight.
---
Well, that's a long time waiting, then.
---
Don’t fall for this dogma. It’s not optimal but in bgs and most of the time it won’t really affect your game play - very rarely are you gonna be getting a fair 1v1 fight where everyone has full cool downs in the open world.
---
I might take you up on this offer. I wanna level an alliance for fun!
---
Ahhh you got me there cuz
---
How is a game that's been out for 15 years and been the sole source for multiple websites and forums still provide major conflicting information and each bis list has a different variant on each site you go?
---
Ignore my last comment if you saw it, it's 28 Weeks later, not 28 days later :^)
---
such a stupid title
---
I wouldn't mind a OSRS approach but Blizzard said they don't want to develop a second MMO and they haven't come out and said anything to the contrary since then.  
---
Also they don't really seem like the type of company that would be too excited about handing development over to a vote.
---
I'm ok with being the odd server at 50/50!
---
Sometimes it is literally all the time. As someone who played on a PvP server from Classic to BFA, roll on a PvE server.
---
Gnomes are the worst gankers. Think there is a complex there is a complex there somewhere.
---
Kick
---
Actually you don’t have any objective evidence to make that claim and you still are making assumptions. I know you know that but you are making an emotional claim and I understand it’s hard to think differently under that sort of mind set
---
Leave the 54 alone and pick a new realm! Grind the NE out to 60 on rest XP and get some welfare epics lol... then park him in Org and pick someone off once a day
---
Horde benediction here -
---
+1 to this idea. Great balance and community. 
---
It’s a pvp server so be careful out there, but both sides are pretty evenly matched and control ebbs and flows constantly around higher level zones. 
---
Flying into LHC is always a toss up lol. 
---
P.s - I’ll be waiting you, alliance scum. Hehe :-)
---
&gt;Targeting that audience is why PvP has consistently declined in popularity in retail.
---
lmao that is SO fucking incorrect. WoW's PvP was far, far bigger in WotLK, Cata and MoP than it ever was before, including becoming the first ever (and only) MMO to achieve actual e-sports status.
---
It turns out that WoW as a test of skill is largely more popular than WoW as a test of time investment, seeing how nobody really complained when the dumb ranking system was removed in TBC.
---
I’m not exactly sure what you’re talking about. If anything I’m underwhelmed. I play Horde and was looking for a server that was majority Alliance. It was just suggestions lol
---
Agreed.
---
Low quality, but I approve.
---
Mages do. Warlocks are a bit behind.
---
No, no data just anecdotal evidence from the type of threads that are generally whiney and the personalities of the alliance Reddit posters
---
Rogues, yes.
---
Warriors, no.
---
Assuming equal skill and optimal groups etc. Warrior is the best dps class in the game, from MC to Naxx.
---
The game is definitely not completely figured out. Look at each bis list from 4 different sources. Look at how to guides for ony threat. Look at how to guides for rag melee aoe mechanic.  Look at fury prot.
---
Let me remind you that Vanilla has undergone a very long testing session, starting with the "Friends &amp; Family" restricted Alpha, then the closed Alpha and all the beta phases.
---
This meant they tried all the possible pop caps and decided for 3k because the world felt full enough and the machines couldn't cope with more.
---
What you're saying is "what would have happened if, at that time, they went with 5k/6k?" (let's just assume that machine power wasn't an issue). The reply is the zerg-fest we probably have today and would have immediately reduced it to a more sensible number.
---
As a Herod refugee, me too
---
as a czech, we dont have the real life ones, so we hate the virtual ones instead
---
Because warriors are the most gear reliant and I've seen idiots 10 levels below 60 get into raids.
---
strange how you can only point out tich.
---
meanwhile the forums back then were on fire from alliance bitching about how long bg ques were. i wonder why?
---
and you sit there pretending you signed up for hardmode. the populations even today aren't as skewed as you clowns claim
---
Its dead. Gonna be the next flamelash
---
The vast majority of my guild played through wotlk. A lot of us would play it again.
---
I play horde on whitemane and the alliance there are very active.
---
The exits from Kargath are camped nearly 24/7 and ally’s will hold bottom of chain to BRD entrance quite often.
---
Roaming ally gank squads are everywhere just like horde. I farm solo and I get got every 10 minutes or so.
---
I’m fine with it, it is what it is. I was able to level to 60 by running dungeons, which you need to do anyways to get your BiS gear.
---
Seriously. The game was already there, they just had to make adjustments and get it in a better position for a re-release. People complain about companies re-releasing video games and movies as a cheap way of making money but when it comes to this game that logic goes right out the window.
---
&gt;&gt; No arena
---
&gt; Basically the whole game for some, half the game for others
---
Presumably it is none of the game for people who are playing Classic, right? Given that it doesn't exist?
---
&gt; Easier to just play on a PvE server.
---
What do pvp versus pve servers have to do with arenas?
---
Ah yeah according to that “data” I’ve concluded most horde players are teens and or brain dead people but yea alliance is pretty whiny and weak but at least they aren’t apes
---
What trinket addon slot you use?
---
This would be silly. Literally all Blizzard needs to do is require the latest expansion in order to play Classic.
---
Undead rogue here. Can confirm that I specifically rolled this class to piss off plebs like the OP.
---
BTW your tears taste great, thank you.
---
You can always try a two hand fury build for battlegrounds and see how you like it.  Fury isn't superior to arms for PvP, but it does have some things going for it, and mobility is one of the big ones.  Improved Intercept combined with the four piece set bonus from warrior PvP gear means you can Intercept every 15 seconds, in addition to the occasional Charge when you're clear of combat. 
---
Death Wish provides 30 seconds of fear immunity.
---
Improved Berserker Rage isn't the strongest and it may be tough to squeeze in, but you can pop it for ten rage pretty frequently.  Ten rage is enough to Intercept if you get dragged into combat before you get a Charge off. 
---
You might be able to find a an in-between spec that's good enough for raiding and good enough for PvP.  WSG premades likely still need someone with mortal strike, but AV doesn't.
---
Ally’s deathball quite well on Whitemane, the death balls just don’t fight each other.
---
When do shamans get bloodlust?
---
Blizzard just needs to fix it obviously, its their product and their problem. If they don't people won't use their product. Simple.
---
Because it all depends on many factors, which is why you need to actually learn the underlying reasons and mechanics behind the decisions for what is and isn’t best in slot, then make your decisions from there.
---
People who just read guide saying “this is best” will always be wondering why they aren’t doing as well as others.
---
It’s not all the time except when you’re trying to get to BRM unless you’re on a really, really bad server. Plus BGs are released on the 10th which will do a lot to help the current situation
---
How many rogues are typically in an AQ/Naxx Raid?
---
The pre raid bis stuff is only going for one stat - +healing. Completely misses out on everything else. It’s actually a pretty terrible collection of gear for anything besides sub 3 min raid fights haha. Make a lasher farming set - buy high int gear off the AH and get blue pieces like magiskull or ones that have int and stam as opposed to healing. Also it’s way easier if you just spec hybrid disc/holy and get the 10% more mana talent...MC is easy you don’t need to be full perfect holy spec for it.
---
Frostbolt was all I used to get to 60. I busted out Firebolt a couple of times but that was only on mobs that are immune to frost damage.
---
ty ♥
---
Afaik Pve servers are dominated by ally though, so this does seem expected to me
---
Yeah zerg the horde side even more when the server is ahorde heavy, have fun with the next reroll after 1-2months.
---
Incendius 10/10
---
Yeah I had a feeling this might be the case. I'll give it a whirl and see how it goes. Thanks guys.
---
There's a big difference between wpvp on a 50/50 server and wpvp on a 70/30 server. One is a fight, the other is slaughter.
---
karma whore
---
Forsaken courier bugged out at Bloodfang. Waiting for server reset to get a quest done.

have you seen druid bug list? LOL.
---
Was it cloudkeepers?
---
Get a Slavering Worg from SFK. It's the fastest wolf in the game, with an attack speed of 1.2.
---
I know, broken tooth is faster, but also way harder to get and way higher level.
---
The concept of raid DPS dictates that neither class should be in greens.
---
You also said you’re having a bad time . Which one is it ?
---
Lol I've singled handedly drove the price of arcane crystals down from 45g to 25g, thorium from 20s per to 10s per item, in a week of farming DM East without a bot. These bits definitely are screwing the economy.
---
you’re triggered
---
Just went this spec a few days ago.  So far not bad for healing ok for dps ok for pvp but I need more gear.  Can't wait to get a few more pieces
---
I have actually set-up shop there to sell fish and surprisingly it goes pretty well. But I'm on an RP server.
---
Short version: Hilmeth shit the game up trying to get himself a bigger bonus check, Long version below.  
---
So I started playing again June 2018 and the game was more or less functional, Then Hilmeth sold the company and a 1 year window started where the games performance within that year determined the bonus the sellers would be paid as a part of the sale. The player base threw a fit over selling the company to a Korean owner infamous for pay to win mechanics in its game Black Desert Online, but CCP staff Promised Eve would not be like that because they were in control. That lasted maybe 3-4 months and in the spring event introduced pay to open loot boxes were introduced, following that the alliance tournament was canceled on the grounds it costs money to run... Through this all player numbers continued the slow decline they have been on since 2016. It was then that hilmeth came to a brilliant conclusion, after taking zero interest in how the game works or is was designed to be played and after a few months pf noobing it up in a WH he decided that HE and HE alone was the one who could save Eve by taking control of what changes would be made, how they would be announced and how they would work.   
---
His opening move was to explain he wanted Eve to enter a "Chaos Era" where the game's mechanics would change quickly and with NO WARNING to players...  His first move was to remove local from the game in nullsec entirely, making it ridiculously easy for anyone to blindside someone trying PVE with next to no chance of them trying to avoid being ganked. This change was incompetently pulled off which resulted in local being completely broken for around a week and continuing to randomly break several times for several days at a time throughout the duration of this "Chaos Event" he called "blackout" *(It was later theorized by players that the only reason this event happened was that the chat servers were broken to begin with and CCP having no idea how to fix them in the first place simply wanted to remove them from the game to avoid the continuing embarrassment of their new cloud based chat servers continuing to fail randomly after having previously declared it fized several times)*
---
Players countered this idiotic change by having standing cap fleets ready to jump to PVErs who made sure to fit a cyno and literally every fucking thing they undocked. So Hilmeth's next amazing decision was to counter the prevalence  so called "super umbrellas" being used to defend PVE players by restricting regular Cyno's to combat recons and covert cynos to covert ships. Essentially forcing you to use very expensive, very squishy ships to bring in any caps you wanted to deploy.   
---
Through this all the player base is tanking spectacularly, losing in some months as many as 1,500-3,000 players  from the concurrent player count, and as the player count is tanking Hilmeth went on every podcast he can find willing to interview him to say that this is the kind of game eve should be, and that he wants the players to feel so nervous and paranoid while playing that they feel they need medication to cope with how unexpected the changes to the base game mechanics are....  
---
A few short months later with the player count down over 10,000 at peak week end times the removal of local is reversed but the cyno change stays.  
---
The game population slowly started to recover, but as of now they are lucky to hit 32,000 on peak time sunday, at the beginning of the year they were hitting as much as 36-37,000 at peak times on sunday.
---
South of revantusk village, in the water, is usually full of bots lvl 30-40 looting the cages and killing the mobs. U think the cages also drop a fishing pole that is good for alliance
---
ok
---
Re: your last bit, that’s just not true. The current pvp gear outclasses pve gear in some situations, and the weapons are already more or less the best in the game. 
---
I didn’t even play TBC fwiw, so I can’t comment on the specifics of itemization. I’m just not a fan of exclusionary stats. Why would you want your big bad ultra super legendary weapon of doom that you got from defeating a world-ending terror to be subpar in a brawl with another player because it doesn’t have any “pvp power”. 
---
I don’t care if there are two separate paths for progression, where you can get OP gear from pvping or you could get OP gear from pveing. We actually have that exact system right now in Classic, believe it or not. I just don’t want that gear to have different stat mechanics.
---
You'd have to wait for them to respawn (which can take a while in some of these areas), and hit DR after 4 kills. That sounds like an awful honor farm and doesn't really solve the bot problem as it just delays them slightly.
---
Plenty of people have been misled in this sub that normal servers are not the “real” game. That somehow they are an inferior player for wanting to play that server type. Now the people who were on the fence and listened to that horse crap advice are rerolling from PVP to Normal realms. Or trying to transfer away to a server where alliance isn’t being corpse camped 24/7. 
---
If the shoe was on the other foot the horde would be crying non stop about those same things. In fact if you look at this sub the horde are crying and whining too just about different things.
---
Well all I'm saying is that warrior scale better with gear than mages.
---
pretty sure she only breaths if someone is in the radius, only time i see it drop is when someone gets hit, when everyones in safezone, she just sits there
---
and you’re on here too getting into epic arguments while the talented horde play the game huh
---
&gt;I saw on a video someone had a paladin addon that showed the class icons of everyone in your party with a blessing icon next to it 
---
Probably Pallypower.
---
30 minutes is plenty of time for progress. You'll get a lot of shit done!
---
.... Wow u got us, we are literally all teens reliving a game we played when we were 3 years old
---
very bright comeback, you seem very intelligent

Stoneform unironically owns tho, two healer classes that can't be blinded, priests immune to viper sting, rogues that can now vanish serpent sting, counters devouring plague, allows bandaging vs warriors,  etc

I’ve done a LOT of leveling in retail with war mode (levels 20-100 around 5-6 toons), and the ganking is very, very minimal. I rarely feel the need to turn war mode off. And griefing has yet to happen to me (opposite faction corpse camping me).

I’ve been leveling alliance toons so it’s horde who has been very friendly. 
---
For the first 1-2 months of allied races, it was a little worse, especially in STV and Duskwood. In fact, there were times when I simply couldn’t enable war mode in those zones at all due to the griefing, but that is in the past in my experience.

It’s an add on called pally power.

6 plus or minus a few is common. You can bring a lot more of course, it just means the healers burn through mana more quickly.

Points were shaved from DW spec and improved execute, and moved to improved Intercept, improved berserker rage, and improved overpower.   You could likely get away with raiding as DW with a minor hit to damage, and PvP with a two hander for burst damage.

Technically they can just make alliance alts (on second accounts) and send the materials over the Neutral AH and turn them in. If the entire server is Horde and there are no Alliance then they'll have to do this.

I'm taking a shit homie

Just reroll. I did it, and thousands of others have too. I can choose when I PVP now. People on normal/ RP still want to rank, plus BGs are right there. And if your not feeling it, your other toon will still be there. 
---
I was in your same boat, hated P2 and now am having as much fun as I was in p1

It was crazy luck. They dropped in week 1, 2, 3 and 7.

Eve was NEVER without non-consensual PVP that was a myth perpetuated by the Wormhole crowd who wanted to be able to drop 100 Tier 3 cruisers on a cap, smoke it, and moon walk out before back up could arrive. What those changes did was turn anyone undocked in a PVE ship into a killmail waiting to happen with ZERO counter play available to the PVE pilot, and the player base numbers nose dived accordingly.
