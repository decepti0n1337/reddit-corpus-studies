He got the guru trinkets because he "backstabbed" Asmon and took them for himself.

Champing* at the bit.
---
Also.. can't wait!
---
Yeah I heard someone in perplexity discord mentioning something about discovering/checking off stream, but still even they would choose to keep few bugs and keep majority things fixed I don't care that much. In the end, they are only one guild on many servers.
---
I was wondering about this myself.
---
On private servers (and probably back in the day of vanilla) it was possible to have a macro that turned on auto attack if the enemy was in melee range, or auto shoot if it was greater than 8 yards away. This  macro would *not* toggle your attack off.
---
It doesn't look like that will be possible using the macros available now, and you can't even turn on auto shoot if you are right, which is not good.
---
Jeez and I thought I had gotten fancy when I finally got a larger monitor to dual screen lol
---
There is a tiny minority of people who go full nolife speedlevel mode every time a fresh server starts to get to 60 asap and lock down the devilsaur leather farm. They then farm as close to 24/7 as they manage to for about 2 weeks and that will make them so rich that they will never need to farm anything again for the entirety of vanilla (1-2 years).
---
.
---
Swifty does. But I’m not sure it’s all the same.
---
I guess you could argue it was for paladins, but ... Night Elves don't have paladins.
---
I'm just playing FFXIV and Planetside 2 as I wait.
---
Old ironforge. Below stormwind. Behind the greymane wall
---
I've read that balancing etc. will all be based on 1.12, and that the phases are strictly content releases.
---
Does that mean items that were changed in certain patches (pre-1.12) will not be changed as phases are released? Or are certain things getting changed that are not reflected in the beta right now? Specifically, things like the three rewards from the Whirlwind Weapon Quest having identical speed since 1.4(?), but I'm fairly certain right now in the beta they are different.
---
No, you're under the impression that there's something in the code that prevented these strong addons from being born in vanilla. It was the times and lack of experience. There's absolutely nothing that Blizzard can do to stop these powerful addons without breaking their "authentic experience" / #nochanges promise.
---
When I saw the mage icon, I lost it
---
TL;DR: There needs to be a totally new paradigm for adding content to an MMO that isn't the traditional “expansion pack” model.
---
&gt; i believe the lack of Dungeon Finder makes an MMO a true social experience where you build friendships and relationships, hence why i emphasize on leaving that feature out
---
You'll quickly realize that Dungeon Finder was added for a very important, game-saving reason: The real problem of never finding dungeon groups on your server because so few people were leveling through the deprecated content as you.
---
With enough of these expansion packs stacking on top of each other you dilute the population and the barrier to entry becomes unrealistic without catch-up mechanics and LFD. 
---
The cost of keeping 1-60 in the game is turning it into this weird tumor hanging onto the current endgame as this irrelevant and unskippable experience.
---
To me this reflects a fundamental problem with the history of MMO design. Adding expansions to an MMO dilutes the player base across different end-game hubs and leveling zones. The original world (holistic, interdependent, and self-contained) was not designed to play well with increasingly stacked, mechanically disconnected “sequels.”
---
Add to 3, doesn't teleport you to the entrance of the dungeon. At best, it allows you to port to the nearest friendly tavern, which gives you some bonus incentives to do it (unlock a pretty far-away flypath point).
---
i played vanilla and i dont see a problem with graphics. you’re changing that for yourself not me, so if you want better looking grass then go for it, ill be using the highest graphics setting for sure. its the gameplay and social aspects that make or break vanilla for me.
---
INSANE LULW
---
[removed]
---
Get this man beta access, Blizzard.
---
These are hilarious. Thanks for the laughs mate.
---
What I meant is pick up quest A go to zone A and complete quest. When heading back see you missed quest B which was in zone A aswell which is then again on the other side of the zone you are currently in :D
---
I broke today and started playing on private servers
---
They actually do know what it means but a lot of the more popular ones have said the grind was too much for them back in the day and probably is nowadays too.
---
Anyone bothered to go to the king's original spot to see if he's there?
---
Omg this is so fucking hype. It doesn't look like it's lagging either. Looks so fun.. Holy shit.
---
Those are just the most famous examples there are plenty examples of questlines wrapping in and out of zones. The Princess in Arathi Highlands is also another really huge expansive questline.
---
Those two lines alone cemented him as an irredeemable villain we eventually had to take down in Cata.
---
EU? I played there!!
---
Dont remember que time tho. It was mostly medium pop
---
OMG ITS NOT LAGGING LIKE CRAZY THIS ISN'T TRUE CLASSIC WOW.
---
Playing PvE only is just so.. empty. Sure you'll never ever get ganked again, but... is that really the experience you want? No risk of any kind, no factions?
---
Okay. 
---
Retail players - migrating from an MMO**RNG** and expecting shit to be easier. Several BfA streamers have been reporting shit as bugs like “level 2 boots not having stats”. If you have the beta, theres BfA players talking shit in general chat about bad classic is and shit, 
---
Private Server players - reporting shit like “sit’n’crit/have to be lvl 15 to talk in trade chat, etc” should be in the game when they were private server exclusive. Again, if you have beta, theres private server clowns bitching about how the beta is worse than Nostalrius.

You could do it in vanilla with chat and console commands :)  
---
It's just in the options panel now
---
Well you can still sneak around and use stealth without speccing into improving it. Normal stealth works just fine you just have to be more careful.
---
Better than vanilla, honestly, where they stood around doing literally nothing. They were involved in a few fetch/deliver quests, but that's it.
---
I never played WoW, but I always loved the other Warcraft games.
---
I try not to think about release tbh. Just kinda hoping I have enough vacation pay to take that week off come August.
---
Dude go watch the streams, that's like nothing compared to what's going on in Classic lmao.

Damn he’s in!
---
Dont forget that pvp occuts on pve servers as well. Its legit more fun
---
This looks good in a "cute but ugly" sorta way
---
yikes.
---
Let me enjoy my hype since it's the only way I can enjoy the beta alright man
---
They were outnumbered 2:1 that was insane.
---
OK this is dumb but how do you know you are in the beta? Does classic appear on [this menu](http://prntscr.com/nqplsl) or something?
---
You deserve a beta key for this.
---
It was implemented from day 1. You could always make a macro that would take you out of bear form, drink a potion/eat a healthstone/whatever, then go back into bear form.
---
TBC made it so you could do that with 1 button press instead of 2. The end result of doing it with 1 button press is essentially the same as if you were able to use potions/healthstones/whatever in bear form. 
---
In Vanilla, the fact that you need to hit the button twice causes a bit of a delay between leaving bear form and going back into bear form - let's call it 0.5 seconds - which means you could take a melee hit while out of bear form. But the macro itself functions the same as it would have in TBC.
---
The way that those macros work should be the topic of discussion. Not the macros themselves.
---
He did it really good, shame that the difference in numbers was so big tho
---
Not sure. Some sources I find group some I find raid. I really don't remember if Raid wide buffs existed in Vanilla. I guess if they did, then Classic will have them.
---
It was posted just before you - sorry.

---
Removed.
---
It's not huge nor expensive. It's a series of like 10 quests. To say that anything in vanilla has anything on the modern game is just fooling yourself. 
---
It's okay to remember the game fondly because we were kids when it came out and we were easily impressed. The impression leaves strong nostalgia and now were adults and less easily impressed. So the newer game doesn't feel as good as the old one when in fact it's so much better.
---
The old game was riddled with bugs and requires grinding that I know I personally don't have time for. I dont know many adults who have time to spend 100+ hours trying to get just to max level again. Don't get me started on raid mechanics. They weren't even real mechanics back then. It was just get enough fire resistance to live and you're good
---
Have to search on the classic version of wowhead, or rather classic.wowhead.com, it's probably just with how wowhead is setup for Google or something along the lines
---
The addon automatically repaired my gear without any errors.  
---
I was able to activate the addon with no issue. The addon doesn't seem to have any options that I can tell nor any indication that it is running.
---
Haha, I remember how like half of the raid had like a yellow or red ping and that was totally normal back in the days.
---
As much as it pains me, I have been living vicariously through these abhorrent WoW classic streamers. I can’t bring my self to play anything else, I’m constantly theory crafting and trying to plan my grind to 60. Even watching these dudes play Classic Beta is better than not. Just seeing original Azeroth is amazing. Only 99 days left.
---
Whats better? Playing retail unironically?
---
Horde is red, Alliance is blue. That's pretty standard. 
---
I don't think there's any kind of designated colors for PvE roles though. I know a lot of tanks choose the blue square or orange circle, and maybe put the yellow star or green triangle on healers, but again that's not really consistent or anything.
---
Well shit. Youre right. I been saying it wrong my whole life.. Good thing google tells me its commonly mistaken so I dont feel so silly.
---
i watched the battle on the sonnydigital stream, that man deserve more love,
---
That's what made it great though. Allies had way more.
---
Lol that was a fun watch, too bad it wound up being pretty anticlimactic because of the massive difference in numbers
---
Oh really? Did you not see a tab under addons in the interface? I wonder if classic doesn't support addon options... okay, thank you so much for testing that for me!
---
how are rogue in terms of solo questing/leveing? is it going to be a hard journey? with the limited of skills... for example.. as a rogue, i should never go in on a pack of mobs for this kill quest, instead i have to kill them 1 by 1
---
26 days. I remember being in duskwood for a long time, messing with stitches and any horde I might see. Spent a lot of time in the 30s just running around STV with friends. Southshore/Tarren Mill skirmishes. Lots of fishing and profession leveling. Running around Ironforge. A good period in the early 50s where I stopped concentrating on hitting 60. I think I was trying to do the ony attunement maybe instead?
---
Can you ride Venruki‘s dick harder?
---
1. It‘s like 30 hordes vs 20 allies.
---
2. Nothing is insane about it. He literally just runs in, this is low lvl PvP with zero tools to show player skill. 
---
3. He fucking fails to hit more than three enemies with his CoC while there are 20 enemies around him.
---
4. Relax, BFA scrubs.
---
Them, talking about something blizzard stated:   
---
" Actually, IIRC throughout all of retail, a majority of the population was PvE servers. "    
---
You, talking from anecdotal experience:  
---
" Not when I played, PvP servers often had queues and were the “preferred” way to play.  "  
---
Don't suddenly shift the goal posts of the question just cause you got downvoted a little lol.
---
I believe most people think it would be the case now, you just got downvoted because you stated something incorrect as if you were smugly correct.
---
You do what you need to do.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTnFuUUXHYk
---
Listen... we had Garrosh cornered in Alternate Nagrand and Thrall stole the kill so that we could get a wicked sick cinematic.
---
With that in mind: I rather they sit still and *we* do everything.
---
I want that also
---
Amen. World PvP is everyday, not an "event"
---
All the haters are wimps. They know classic will be hard and they want to be catered too.
---
Yes but Horde = power while Alliance = numbers.
---
Never said he didn’t have wow cred, I just said his opinion on vanilla doesn’t matter. He was anti vanilla from the start so who gives a fuck if he’s enjoying the beta.
---
looked similar in numbers, horde mages were just WAY better. controlled the fight with novas and cone of cold.
---
Vanilla is full of world PVP, that's just the nature of how the open world and end game works.
---
It's not about the damage it's about making them panic. You've got a mage in your ranks freezing your shit and blowing people up people either run or focus on you. People also rally on you and push up causing more chaos. Back during the big 3 days AV's mages broke stalemates at the bunkers frequently because they'd push up and blow people up and everyone would panic.
---
That's what I was wondering. I was under the impression the volume two versions had been updated. Bummer.
---
yeah i mighth just have to do that, my orc will look cuter without it tbh.
---
That is independent of what I said. I said there was no reason for them to do it. Not they someone should or should not use the settings.
---
I'm guessing this can't find guilds that no longer exist? My guild had the word "Phoenix" in it's name on Argent Dawn, but the search finds no guilds with that name.
---
I'm pretty sure also that the guild was called Phoenix Dawn or something like that, and in nu-WoW there is a guild by that name on Argent Dawn, but it is definitely not my old guild, it's some 10 member guild with only Blood Elf members, while mine was a guild of hundreds of players in vanilla. Must mean some time after I quit the guild was deleted and some other players created a guild with the same name.
---
How long did the fight last?
---
I like how if this was some literally who rando from 4chan streaming this you wouldn't have made this thread but because it's a well known streamer former pro gaymur cance that you're gonna bank on the karma and post this clip to further proliferate the cancer.
---
I see that happening.  Lots of people share your opinion and making a list is surely fairly low effort Karma farm waiting to happen.
---
Does a top 10 list REALLY need to be 30 minutes long?
---
Asmongold was saying that on his stream, but I had both open and the Allies seemed to have a bit more but it was pretty even. The mages just completely controlled it.
---
y’all make it really hard for people who didn’t play vanilla to get into this, this sub is so toxic about retail.. just enjoy that classic is coming out! i know i am excited, but these types of things are just so negative.
---
Them being outnumbered doesn't matter, Asmon wasted his time trying to recruit low level 12s to fight...bad mistake
---
i don't think it's "the original REEEE" and hey you don't have to be embarrassed it's just a meme you learn everyday :D
---
Druid is one of the strongest leveling classes once you get forms.
---
You have decent dps, can run/swim faster, have self heal and you can regen mana while fighting in cat form.
---
Paladin survives really easily but it's slow as hell and really really boring.
---
Like 2 hours with a lot of downtime between fights to regroup and summon reinforcements.
---
As much as I don't enjoy griefing/harrassing a specific player, that's kinda the vanilla experience.
---
I dont think the majority of people care about if they do some visual upgrades to the game, i think more the point is to atleast simulate how the game was played during vanilla.
---
Atleast you have a choice to play with the Classic settings such as the water and foliage.
---
Modern WoW has more flash and that's about it to me. There are a bunch of gimmicky quest mechanics and annoying cutscenes, so if you like that kind of stuff then fine, but I really don't. I've played Vanilla back in the day, retail WoW, and Vanilla private servers. It's not nostalgia my dude, it's just a more enjoyable experience at the expense of polish and pizzazz for people like us. Also, max level isn't all there is to the game, but retail seems to have pushed that line of thinking so hard.
---
Addons turn the flip-phone that is the WoW UI into a smartphone capable of many more things. It's not just quality of life improvements like a better map, bag sorting, and automatically selling/repairing at vendors. There are tools to help you raid, heal, dps, tank, pvp, farm, level, etc. 
---
The game client doesn't reveal a lot of the data available to players, addons change this. Some of these addons are so powerful that not using them puts you at a significant disadvantage.
---
We had addons in vanilla and some were must-haves.
---
We'll have addons again in classic and some will be must-haves. There will just be more and better because developer talent and experience has gone a long way in 15 years.
---
There is no "way the game was meant to be played". You do what you want in WoW.
---
The only addons that Blizzard seems adamant won't make it into classic is a Looking-for-Group / Looking-for-Raid addon, but this isn't really that big of a deal (nor am I sure what Blizzard thinks they could do to stop it). There will be a server-wide Discord for this purpose and not using it will put you at a disadvantage.
---
Quin69 (or is he NZ? Same thing right?). Also, no the servers are all US afaik.
---
No. [Gressil, Dawn of Ruin](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23054) in main hand and [The Hungering Cold](http://classicdb.ch/?item=23577) in offhand is BiS.
---
no, Horde always had more. by the time Asmongold put together one raid, the Horde already had almost two. everyone wants to kill Asmongold to piss him off, whereas no one on the Alliance really cared ... or, like the Horde, they don't like Asmongold so they ignored when he was asking for help.
---
Every time I see him stream, his bags are ALWAYS full!
---
The crab walk pose nearly made me lose my coffee on the monitor. I mentally heard Zoidberg making his noises as he proceeds to stab the quest giver and waddle away...
---
Alliance had more people but Horde had wayyy more mages in their groups.
---
Wait for real?
---
I would have cast blizzard from the bush but this was huge dick energy
---
WTF , this is Classic. I want CLASSIC raidframe,s not BFA shit
---
‘I dont even know why they added better water or foliage effects’
---
Why would it matter if it only effects the person changing the setting? id say make the graphics as good as possible, spell effects included, as it literally doesnt impact anyone elses gameplay whatsoever. It’s still vanilla, just my water and grass looks better than the next persons, but they wont know...
---
If the GOATs from Vanilla all come back, there are gonna be some epic PvP videos with a  higher than one pixel quality.
---
Thanks! I have always been super into the Diablo books so when making a Warlock it seemed like the best choice. :P
---
Still their top rogue is doing almost twice the dps of the next top dmg class, yikes!
---
Roleplay-wise the Horde have always been disenfranchised and struggling for a place in the world. I mean the orcs in Azeroth are literal aliens, the tauren were on the brink of extinction before turning to the orcs for help, the only trolls that are cool are the ones that aren't cannibalistic cult savages, and the undead are abominations that only exist because of someone's else lust for power. 
---
The Horde has always been the strongest faction in terms of raw power but they lack the numbers to back it up. The Alliance races are all pretty fickle and too comfortable for their own good but they can afford to be because they have strong populations with a lot of natural resources. 
---
It's interesting that even in-game numbers reflected this, as I recall Horde was always the lesser-populated faction except on those rare, insanely skewed ones that had like a 9 to 1 ratio favoring Horde. But similar-ratioed servers existed as well, favoring the Alliance. 
---
Really it wasn't until blood elves showed up that the Horde and Alliance became more of a 50/50 split in-game, and you could tell that the Horde population on any given server was ALWAYS at least 50% blood elves. 
---
I guess we'll see what happens this time around when the Horde are the underdogs again.
---
That undead’s stare should become a meme format.
---
For what? Noname parasitizing on asmons popularity and grouping with spergs? Like hell.
---
+2k viewers while all the top dogs are on?
---
Sign me the fuck up
---
So happy I wont have to quit my job or drop out of school for 3 months to aggressively play this time around.
---
Yeah I noticed now, searching the keywords within the website finds the stuff, but searching for it on google does not find anything at all. Annoying, but thanks for solving the problem.
---
Also weird thing is, I distinctly recall having a lot of these epic tier High Warlord items on my orc warrior, but I was 13-15 years old and not amazing at the game, and all I see is people saying rank 14 was impossible to achieve except for some corrupt premade groups that manipulated who got rank 14 each week. But I never played in a premade BG group once.
---
Maybe it was easier on my server because it was a RP PvE server so less players competing in ranked PvP?
---
It's less about the damage and more about the CC he provided by catching &gt;10 people in a frost nova.
---
HAHA
---
Im pretty sure asmongold had two raids and Ven had one, I could be wrong tho. Maybe alot of asmons guys were not in the push
---
I think we need a better perspective. Think of all the suffering and addiction we've collectively gone through with this stuff. We can't let it happen again, we can't let it consume us. It's just a game after all.
---
I have a few questions:
---
1. What's the situation of shadowmeld? Cooldown, can it be used in combat? Does it break your stealth when you cast aimed shot or are you revealed after the cast is over like the good old times?
---
2. What about escape artist? Cooldown? Does it have a cast time? And what exactly does it remove with the current patch?
---
3. And finally what's the out of combat stealth bug like? Do you get out of combat instantly after pvp combat or is 5 second rule (which was actually a bug then it became a feature when they couldn't fix it) there still?
---
I don't think you should be talking about spergs.
---
&gt;  How CAN we have that first time experience again
---
You can't. That's not what nostalgia is.
---
That's pretty much his average viewerbase. Everyone following the hype is watching Asmon or Venruki.
---
Great food, and yet, the most terrible WiFi known to mankind outside of public libraries.
---
So you will try to connect to WoW on your Laptop... and never quite get in.
---
Yep, I can see that now. Maybe the disorder of such big battles allow this kind of plays, I just felt weird watching a mage stand some pretty good seconds between so many people and not receiving dmg or cc. But he also barely survived too. Thanks for the answer!
---
I answered this way before I got even one downvote, what are you on about m8?
---
No idea who had more numbers but watching this on asmongold channel the biggest world pvp fight I ever seen live was awesomeness
---
I am, but betas and PTRs never have Australian servers, this is no exception. 
---
I will say though that if this is 255 ping, it feels like they've employed some black magic that makes it hard to notice, there's no real loot lag, I don't feel the latency when grabbing quests, it is remarkable smooth.
---
I literally said how we can have a bit back... obviously that’s not what nostalgia is, not fully,  but there’s still some magic there.

This is only my perspective from asmon's stream, but in the final push it looked like way more horde were in the battle. Either way, it awesome to watch.
---
Hi, /u/rank_1_glad
---
World PVP is literally every day
---
Yeah Asmon and Esfand only had 1.5 raids at the peak. Idk how much Venruki and the rest of the Horde had but there's no way it was 'way less' than that. Regardless, it was super fun to watch. I loved hopping between different streamers' perspectives.
---
You missed how the internet has changed. WoW was so popular because it gave a sense of community - something that wasn't really available elsewhere. Social media wasn't a thing, outside of MySpace(lol) and bare bones Facebook you needed a college email to sign up for. No Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, Discord, etc. So after a long hard day at work/school, you chilled with your guildmates, who were doing the same. You almost didn't have any other option for that, after all.
---
horde had 2 and a bit alliance had almost 2 full ones maybe 15ish different. i had almost no lag there though so thats a plus
---
You could only up the density, they didnt have moving grass in vanilla. God people are so fucking stupid lol. Downvote away people.
---
So by that logic they should add in the updated models, update the textures and models of the old gear. And yet they don’t because the point is to recreate the game from 2004. Again, there is no point to add in the water and foliage especially when they are not updating anything else. And again you’re personalizing it asking why it matters if you have the choice to toggle it on your client, when that is not relevant. I don’t see why they would add it in the first place.
---
I was in RFC and put my pet on passive, turned off auto taunt. Very good! But... is this true to the vanilla experience? I feel like I need to go full huntard in WC. Don’t auto taunt- taunt randomly and at terrible times. I’ll start pulling random packs too.
---
Well I had both stream open and when they were sitting in Refuge, they looked like they had a ton more. But Asmongold literally spent 15 minutes after the fight saying they had less people to bring that point home.
---
Trying to diminish the Horde victory pffft.
---
(Seriously though, who cares, this was great fun!)
---
Just got to the barrens definitely curious how STV looks and what kind of advantage gnomes will have there against people running high. Perhaps a natural consequence of taking better looking foliage?
---
Is the quiver number counter there so you can see how many arrows you have left?
---
Yeah man, was fun to watch so many POVs for the arathi battle right now.
---
Alliance got absolutely rolled.  Horde had superior numbers and way more coordination.  They didn't stand a chance.
---
Im in, 220ish ping but doesnt feel too bad.
---
&gt; I literally said how we can have a bit back
---
No you didn't.
---
Would you happen to know the codes for the colours of the Horde and the Alliance?
---
Sorry in your other replies in the thread you're complaining about the downvotes, and your reply there was defensive.
---
Read what I wrote.  I did.
---
For people unaware of raid scale world PvP in vanilla, this is text book meta play that a mage is suppose to do.
---
lots of mages think it's best to sit in the back and cast blizzard and flame strike etc.  but grabbing your nuts and going kamikaze mode into the middle to get frost novas / CoC / arcane explosions off is how your suppose to do it
---
It's a common case of hating something because a lot of people like it.
---
Can you link that? I don’t remember ever complaining about downvotes...
---
This will go down in history. What a great start to classic
---
Yea, but that's the thing, you never think about it, you just buy arrows whenever you're in town just as you'd sell greys and repair.
---
At the End Horde had 2 full raids plus hanger ons, Asmon second raid was mostly lower lvl's
---
Kids can't take PTO :^)
---
&gt; As always amazing video! I’d say you pretty much hit the nails on the head with these but it actually got me thinking... what HASN’T changed? How CAN we have that first time experience again even if we played back then? For myself I was a rogue through all of Vanilla till Naxx and then my guild made me reroll priest... all of this on the horde side. With that in mind I plan to go alliance for the slight differences in story and zones and switch up the classes and professions too. It’s not much but it’s something.

 for editing an amazing video.
---
I have been watching this all day and I am so effin hyped for classic. The servers have been great. The community is amazing and I can't wait to play with all of you guys in August. FOR THE HORDE!!!!
---
that's simply not true, asmo had a raid and a half, horde two and more
---
I'm sure you'd win 10/10 1v1's against him with your insane private server skills
---
I mean if you dont read the quest notes then just saying that modern wow has no good stories is kinda bullshit. That's literally judging a book by its "flashy" cover. MoP I'd widely regarded as the best story telling the game has ever produced. Along with wrath of the lichen king and Legion. 
---
Maybe you like a dumbed down experience and that's fine. But you can't try and say vanilla stories were better when they just plain aren't. 
---
Vanilla is better left to nostalgia because alot of people are gonna go back and play it and realize it's not going to live up to memory. I also have played on private servers and frankly. I was incredibly disappointed, I remembered the game being ground breaking and when I went back to play it.. well it was just subpar compare to today's standards for stories.
---
I know 3 Australians that have got an invite
---
Anyone with a crap computer got into classic? 
---
My gf is keen to play with me, but we can’t afford another computer. 
---
My main rig is fine, but the two other options are either a thinkpad x220, or a 2013mbp 13inch. The mbp is faster and I’ll put windows on it, but not sure how well they’ll go. 
---
FWIW I’ll be on the laptops so she can experience the game for the first time on a nice system. 
---
I don’t care about graphics one bit as long as I get steady frames.
---
Had both streams open asmon had 1 full raid and Esfan had half a raid. Looked like Venruki had 2 full raids.
---
Not only that you could tell that Asmons team were basically headless chickens, Venruki was able to get people moving it was only when they were too slow to go full in the previous fights that they could pick them off.
---
just ended
---
Please do explain to me how important it is that people need to generate 110/130% more threat than the current target pull agro when they have generated 0 threat. 'Cuz I'm pretty sure 1 is more than 130% of 0.
---
god-tier editing
---
Thanks man =) Currently without a gpu since i had to RMA it. But its an 8700k @4.8GHz on a z370 board and 1080, 16GB RAM, 1TB of SSD storage and 5TB of HDD storage.  
---
120hz 27inch, 24 and 27 inch 60hz.
---
Which server? Emerald Dream US?
---
True, I just like the narrative of one team going up against another team with superior numbers and beating them with cleaver tactics; those mages were like a fucking cavalry charge.
---
Time stamp? It’s just taking me to the full stream
---
2k is impressive? He averages around that mark can fluctuate from 1.5k-3.5
---
The other streamers are just more interactive
---
okay you dont know who is sony, so he is a noname?
---
Asmongold was filled with salt after this battle, one of my favorite twitch viewing experiences ever.
---
Everyone cares but you*
---
Why did you edit out the bits i quoted? 😂 would it matter if they did add updated character models as an optional toggle? aslong as core gameplay is the same, it literally doesnt matter what somebody else would rather have on their own screen. that option doesnt effect your vanilla wow experience at all so why take it away from them?
---
Asmongold only had 35 people at the end. They were trying to get two raids but couldn't get enough people to join and combined before the final time they got pushed back from the wall. It sure looked like horde outnumbered them to me but they got beat either way.
---
What a battle, glad I got to see this unfold.

---
Vanilla Coke Zero for life.
---
Almost 13 days as a warrior.
---
If you squint just the smallest bit it absolutely looks legit though. Take it from me because I have bad eyesight and don’t even need to squint. This one legit got me for a second and started wondering about the beta. You’re doin good work my man.
---
Depends whether you plan on leveling solo or with others. Paladin has a weak kit for killing mobs, so you want to get seal of command asap
---
Well they would have to rebalance all raid encounters If debuff Slot Cap was to be removed
---
How bad was it?  I don't like his streams and was watching Venruki and Sony
---
You can tell he was frustrated because he just wanted to finish his WW quest. But this is what he asked for, he just thought he would win and he was crying when he lost.
---
Hope this gets sorted out.
---
There is no Australian (OCE) servers but I do know of some normal people  from OCE (non media/streamer) that are in beta.
---
WORLD PVP HYPE BOIS, that battle was one of the most fun wow related thing i've seen in a long time!
---
Watching this from the moment it unfolded with 2 streams open was awesome. The only thing that was a bit unfortunate was that Asmon didn't enjoy himself very much. Nevertheless, the amount of people showing up, lots of known streamers, server almost never lagging and Venruki having fun made this a very entertaining evening :)
---
For the Horde!
---
I had all three open, like 7 at the time, and it was amazing. Just glorious!
---
Almost anything is better, to be completely honest
---
Why? The only reason Blizzard would create an event/"rotation" is to incentivize a bit of content that may be lacking or completely dead, neither of which are true for wpvp in Classic.
---
More fun than retail has given me since wrath. and I was just watching the thing.

---
don't their characters from Beta get deleted before release anyways? And then he can always come up with a new name. Why would anyone care about his streams after classic is out?
---
What was the point in starting this? Wasn't the guy just doing the quest or something?
---
One thing that ill add to what others have said is that not all addons are the same.  Some make things easier or whatever, but quite a few dont really change the difficulty or whatever, its just preference.
---
Things like making unitframes look different, addons that turn your bags into one giant bag, etc are just preference, they dont tell you where quest objectives are, etc.
---
The question I am asking is what would would be the point of adding in the updated models, when the purpose of the project is to restore the game from 2006. This has nothing to do with toggling or player choice. Is this difficult for you to understand? They are replicating everything meticulously down to spell batching and resistance values, so what rationalizes updating the visuals in a project with the purpose of replicating the game.
---
Realistically tho, Asmon, Esfrand, they're both bots. Mechanically terrible players but people still defend them. Insanity.
---
you need to submit a bug report, you ui for descriptions on the right gradually becomes smaller with each box
---
Then beta is wrong. Battleshout was 110% (bet my life on it) the "cheese" strategy for tanking nefarian adds during phase 1. I specifically remember sometimes putting a warrior in a group with all hunters/warlocks so their pets got buffed as well to increase threat.
---
That's what addons are for.
---
Arcane concentration procs of "cast" not targets hit. Same proc chance hitting one or 20 mobs.
---
Only exception might be arcane missiles, needs beta testing.
---
15 years and top 50 us guild for a long time.... Not sad just already been there, done that.
---
:) 
---
Oh boy
---
I never said they were better, I was just counter-acting your bias towards how much actually went into the old quests and how there were actually more quests than not that were just random fetch. Even stereotypical fetch quests like the Maclure farm quests have a little mini story wrapped up in there if you read the quest text. That's fine if it's not what some people want, the whole point is to have the option for people that do want to play it like is the case with emulated versions of old games. It's like saying someone shouldn't enjoy playing Super Mario 64 because it's old and outdated compared to Super Mario Odyssey. It's just kinda short-sighted and narrow-minded.
---
Blizzard is just as good to keep people controlled, if not better because there isn't a limit on it, can be done at range, and is consistent damage.
---
I get it, he did root some people and made a cool play.  But the title is just click baitish that's all I'm sayin.
---
cant understand how sonydigital wasnt in the video, he was basically the warrior in the battle
---
Had both of their streams open while watching it was glorious
---
nah mechanic was leading our 2nd raid at the end
---
My wife is letting me binge on vacation the first two weeks since she will be out of town at a conference. The only price is that I give her some hand-me-down gear and bags for her mage.
---
Hey, by the way I just double checked the wow census that was made, pvp servers outnumber PvE by a large margin. Not trying to be an ass, I’m just trying to explain that in every single community that lends itself to classic wow PvP servers are always the most popular and talked about.
---
by 1.12 all druids had innervate but yes, most raiding druids were resto
---
because some people prefer their games to not look dated, dont you agree that the foliage makes the game look a lot better?
---
&gt; vinalla
---
Rofl. In 2006 I made 60k / yr running a gold selling site. (I mostly flipped gold on other sites, sold it on mine as "American farmed" which I am not, it was not, mostly.) I paid a a guy $480 a month and he employed a crew of eight (supposedly) with that amount.  I did this from 2005 to 2007 when we were getting constantly banned (including my main play account.). Around that time I was barely making 8k a year as the market had shifted so hard that cutting the cost of gold was digging to deep and I stopped.
---
So this dude was making way more than the average.
---
It was originally Asmon grinding for his WW quest but then a group of 5 horde came and then it blew up from there.
---
Because battle masters are in the game and I can see people just waiting at the battle masters until ques pop ; /
---
Very fair assessment and on point
---
Amazing editing @dalex_live
---
I noticed there was like 4-5 horde streamers and 3 ally streamers, besides asmon the other two didn't have that many viewers and I think that's why they were able to put together a more organised group, loads of times you'd see people running off and dying before the fight and took so much longer to regroup.
---
Apparently Nostalrius team said about their meeting with blizzard, that J. Allen Brack was the most focused one in their discussions. So his words became a meme, but I think the man actually wants it to succeed!
---
Hi, /u/Suxiaoyan
---
How to Horde 101.
---
Oh okay, I must have missed that then. I thought Esfand was leading the other raid.
---
There are none unfortunately.... Lmk if you find one
---
You don't need to put Windows on the Mac for WoW, unless you're planning to anyways.
---
It should be fine honestly, I've run WoW on 2013 MacMinis before without issue. Did 1080p@30fps no problem, and you can always use the "Classic" graphics presets which are even less demanding.
---
This was THE best thing I've seen on twitch, so glad I caught it live! I'm sooooo hyped to classic. POGGERS
---
zzzzz I seriously don't want to see the streamer circlejerk start this soon.
---
Nothing in this vod is very impressive, sorry guys.

---
The streams benefit from having a shitton of  viewers/a huge following + the hype of Classic.
---
Argent Dawn EU frequently has battles of over 80 people ( 2 full raids at the v ery least ), but it's not uncommon for 200 people to show up.
---
he stopped streaming and hosted some thot
---
LOOKS LIKE PVP VIDEOS ARE BACK ON THE MENU BOYS!
---
Can we group up? The only spells I'm putting in my action bar are Scorch and Fear.
---
wow story after cataclysm is not even canon so it doesnt matter
---
now that we get wow classic it confirms it - they know retail is shit and they want their old players back who arent stupid enough to play retail
---
Things procing off themselves was fixed pretty early, I want to say 1.4 or 1.5, but they could still proc each other. You could theoretically have an infinite chain of Sword Spec, Windfury, Hand of Justice, etc but the odds of that are really low.
---
How does it run on a low end pc?
---
1 Warchief and 1 Mopyboi.
---
Iirc everything just runs slightly better using bootcamp than native OS X. Even if I only get 5-10 more FPS I’ll do it. 
---
But your experience inspires confidence so I should be ok I hope
---
That's fair enough is it a bit click baity but he also did a legit strategy for breaking up groups of people. From my experience doing world pvp the explosive damage from Nova, Cone of Cold, snap repeat then spamming AE it tends to kill alot more people too. While less sustained damage than blizzard, blizzard tends to not get many kills unless someone is in the fray to have the explosive burst to finish them off.
---
Tough luck. Try talking to someone
---
Oh ok so maybe the grass is giving the vibes, because this is definitely Cata grass.
---
Man can't wait for Aug 27, 2019.
---
I see those keycaps off to the side. I know why you took this pic. I bought the same ones you did. I also took pictures.
---
I get that ganking is lame for a lot of people but I'm still trying to wrap my head around the idea that someone else in the multiplayer video game is "wasting" your oh-so precious time (precious time spent playing a game in the first place) by playing in a way that's completely fair within the game terms
---
You’re not interfacing with what I am saying at all. But to respond to your irrelevant question, no I think the foliage is overdone and ruins the intended aeshetic of the game. I don’t have any problems playing old games because I know when they were made. I can play legend of zelda, age of empires, you name it. There graphics being less modern doesn’t reallt factor into my enjoyment or interest in playing the game.
---
Watching all of these fights were so awesome. This is what Classic is all about.
---
To repeat, I'm just saying that for most people. It's better to just let the memories stay memories because for most people. Classic wow won't live up to how amazing their childhood memories of it are.
---
Its just like halo man. I remember halo combat evolved was a master piece of engineering that I remembered being the scariest most thrilling and energetic game I'd ever played.
---
I had nightmare about the first flood level as a child. You go back and replay it and it's just not the same. It taints your wonderful childhood memories.
---
Most of this is caused by the bitterness of being an adult and having experienced life more and not having a youthful mind that's easily amazed and impressed. People become numb to this over the years. 
---
So that's all I'm saying with the video games that are out today. Vanilla will boom for a little bit and will die out as people go back to retail because they realize it's just not the same. No matter how much they want it to be.
---
Lmao we really out here so bored waiting for release
---
Tried here? http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charhistory.php
---
I am also curious about this!
---
Dude's not getting his ax.
---
they are night elf models but the face texture isnt as good as it can be, they eyes look weird
---
i guess its because they never planned them to be a playable race, they never put too much effort into them and it was also 2002-2003 when they made them
---
the blood elves in the camp in northen azshara use the same models i think, i cant remember if their eyes were green
---
That's definitely a spicy take - I do enjoy aspects of WSG and AB a lot, but I definitely see your point. In my mind, the more PvP we can get out in the world, the better.
---
How does everyone feel about add-ons in classic?
---
Iv heard about people running in huge groups putting that shit on lockdown... Its crazy
---
He hosted his Girlfriend of over 1 year.
---
World PvP at its finest ❤️❤️❤️ those clips of Gandalf made me lmao
---
Huh? These dudes are gonna have crazy amounts of people playing on their server to play with them. They regularly get 50k viewers at a time. Yes they'll have to make new characters, but people are going to follow them and massively over populate the server they end up on.
---
Yea, I'm going to use some and give some away to friends that are coming back for Classic.
---
Much more better than warfronts! Also no loot and buff incentives required like warmode to make wpvp happen
---
Try looking your character up on http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charhistory.php
---
Look at the sidebar weekly thread list.
---
They're talking about private servers, or 99% of them are. I'm sure some vanilla servers did have a queue for who gets r14 next by setting up brackets, but it's a much more common thing on private servers. Basically near impossible to get it on private servers without being part of the groups and it being your turn to get it.       
---
But your server being rp pve would probably also make it easier compared to a PvP server, or just a normal PvE server as you said
---
i dont think bfa players want or care about vanilla - they want to be rewarded for doing nothing
---
AQ cleared fully about 3 times and starting to poke Naxx trash to see how we stood up when 2.0.1 dropped.
---
We might've been further along but pretty much as soon as TBC's release date was announced it got harder to get people motivated to raid since the gear was gonna be useless in a few months. And it was pretty frustrating as it was.
---
I played classic wow heavily in junior high and high school. I would print out stuff to read during class lol
---
I just can’t believe you got that name.  Truly awesome.
---
I, too, am a huge fan of Diablo.
---
No one used them back then anyway. X-pearl
---
Oh baby, I cannot wait.
---
There is world pvp until DKs
---
Maybe pservers are more competitive but in vanilla you absolutely did not need some elite well-oiled machine of a premade lol. You just needed a bunch of people and some good ol' collusion. Guilds would just rotate through players getting R14, and many of them were garbage.
---
I know you’re trying to be a funny-guy, but comparing a 1v1 to a fight with tens of people on each side is just silly.
---
the lag only didnt exist because the server is a fraction of a retail server. it was also in the middle of a dead zone and everyone in that zone was just pvping.
---
if that happens on a live server ofc it will lag.
---
RP servers didn't really have any extra rules or TOS. If you had a non-RP name, someone might report you and a GM would make you change it, but that was literally the only difference.
---
Making a raid with a purpose of not letting a guy quest... Yikes
---
The lag was bad at first because of skeletons be left on the ground. They didn't have any time limits/body limits so after just like 20 minutes of people constant rezzing and dying again TM/SS would be flooded with skeletons and everyone would be hardcore FPS lagging on top of the server lag from the people there. They quickly added in some skeleton limits and it helped a ton.
---
Quin on twitch  is new to classic. Pretty fun seeing him realising the quest items didn’t appear on minimap or sparkle
---
I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today
---
I watched this develope from Guzu and Payo ganking in the wetlands to a full on 80 vs 80 wpvp battle.
---
Best 6 hours of my life.
---
Asmon spamming revenge at the enemy tank with no rage while staring at his impending demise in complete and utter disbelief is so funny to watch
---
Yes.  Maybe 1 out of 50 pvp encounters in the world have been a positive influence on my gaming experience.  The rest are all gankers/groups of people squatting on a quest hub preventing me from actually playing the game.
---
If I want to pvp, I'll do BGs.  When I go out and want to quest and level, I don't want to be disturbed by xxSephirothxx on his 60 rogue repeatedly killing all the &lt;level 30s he can find.
---
Another great video, thanks! 
---
Definitely looking forward to server name and type announcements, mainly to setup base with and for friends.
---
This was so much fun to watch. It's great to see him playing how a mage should play in mass pvp. Pushing into lines dropping insane burst and getting the fuck out. It's so much fun I can't wait to get back into playing classic again.
---
Oh vey. Why isn’t everyone fading away? This is an outrage! Come back to retail goys. New pets on the store! Discount for you. Instant level 120. Enter your credit card goy
---
bought one. 
---
I'm assuming I can use this to buy classic + game time for classic.
---
Right, It doesnt factor into ‘your’ enjoyment, which is fine, leave the setting on low. it might factor into someone else’s and it doesnt harm your experience, so why not? greater graphics for me means greater immersion. i love old games like zelda and age of empires, but if i could play those exact same games with updated graphics and the exact same core gameplay, i would. I’m sure there are plenty of people that would agree with both of us, so in that regard alone blizzard made the right move with the optional toggle...
---
Yeah this stuff is definitely in the pros but when the cons are stuff like...the majority of the playerbase leaving when the streamers leaves or having the possibility of a streamer being in your chosen leveling area (and thus with a train of followers likely all killing your shit)...it makes me want to avoid them.
---
He has been asking for this since way before beta. If the quest is that important do it off stream.
---
I love the energy and hype coming back to WoW!
---
why even bother commenting when you dont know who he is, he has gained alot of popularity in the classic beta before this.
---
I will be playing on a PvP server because Azeroth should not be a safe space
---
Same, crazy to think it all started with Guzu and Payo ganking in the Wetlands.
---
You have violated the law
---
 
---
That’s just Asmon though isn’t it. The second something doesn’t go his way he just starts crying until he either rage quits or makes up an excuse to do something different. (See any dark souls play through for reference)
---
As irritating as they could be when farming, they produced some cool chat/WPvP moments for me. I felt pretty bad for them actually, because I was out there farming all night too, and sometimes it just suuucked.
---
I‘m actually certain that I would whoop his ass in 1.12 ten out of ten times. Private server vets are actually skilled at this game, you know...
---
Fearful Alliance deserters, very sad
---
Soda can still get flag griefed. Remember if you stand in someones aoe while flagged you cleave and get flagged yourself.
---
Ill 100% be using the updated graphics. Ive already level 1 60 and couple 40's on private servers playing on old graphics.
---
Hello everyone! I am just curious if any guilds out there are already recruiting? I know we don't know server names yet but I am more than willing to go wherever a solid guild is going to be. I am currently debating between mage, warlock, or potentially holy pally/resto shaman. Obviously this means that my faction is still very much up in the air as well. I am east coast so prefer a guild that doesnt go too late into the night (say after 2am est). Feel free to pm me more info.
---
As long as I avoid ageists like you, I think I'll be good
---
Is there a youtube link? I'm at work.
---
I addressed BoPing and freedom in my post and I think they are amazing in any pvp scenario as you will probably feel pretty gimped not having at least one on your team, but, what you are addressing isn't their healing potential, it's the utility they bring. Any other spec paladin can bop,sacrifice,freedom.  They are most useful as a dispell bot not necessarily their healing, sacrifice allows them to do that job and dispel other healers as well. The big problem is really that they have to cast their heals, if they are allowed to freecast then there is no problem, but I doubt the enemy team will allow you to do that. Warlocks will use curse of tounges on you which pretty much messes up any healing your going to be doing. A 6 sec casting window is just asking to be counterspelled and spending 3 seconds on a small heal is not going to do much. There it is up to your mages and druids to decurse you but from my experience those come rarely. So while I think they are amazing for the utility they bring, that utility doesn't necessarily have to brought as a healer.
---
Yeah but they're not gonna stay for very long
---
Which will be ruined by the existence of a reporting system.  I am sorry.
---
Twitlonger incoming Pog
---
This is possibly the most impressive Paint job I've ever seen.  Seriously, in whatever you did this in, that's impressive.
---
F
---
I was thinking that, I had 500ms until late BC.
---
Oh. I'd definitely like to get to rank 14 again for the gear because to me WoW is all about the PvP, I don't really enjoy raiding. But at the same time I want to try a PvP server this time, I hope that doesn't make getting rank 14 impossible for me.
---
2h40m26s
---
Ive seen it and been a part of it on ED but we could never get more than 3 total 40 mans to shard in meaning one team is out numbered because the server wouldn't allow it. We even crashed the server raiding org one time last year
---
I heard something about the server would already have 16 slots for debuffs (which came on a later update) is this true?
---
He stopped streaming because he was going to his girlfriends to watch game of thrones, no need to start drama.
---
you think they do, but they dont.
---
Scrubs will be scrubs. Let them live in their small minds lmao
---
I’m going no adds-ons for my main at least... alts I might reconsider.
---
Welcome to Vanilla with streamers
---
There’s a discord link as others have alluded to.
---
Best of luck to you in your travels.
---
Vanilla pvp doesn’t really take skill because crit is way overpowered in PvP due to no resilience.
---
At a certain gear level it just becomes about who can lockdown who longer to get their 2 shot combo off.
---
That’s why engineering is king.
---
Its been stated numerous times that everything is 1.12 based except for progressively releasing content. 16 debuff slots was in 1.12
---
This. I pointed it out in another comment and already got twenty downvotes. Scrubs will be scrubs I guess

Hi, /u/epicupvoted
---
&gt; I heard something about the server would already have 16 slots for debuffs (which came on a later update) is this true?
---
[Yes.](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2146)
---
I used to play on detheroc as alliance and used to run into ven, sodah, gammer, and sonydigital in arena a lot. Had a lot of great duels with them too. Ven and sodah were always super chill dudes and were always willing to give advice on matchups. Great dude
---
Oh wow, is that how it always was?  I always thought just as long as VW didn’t get the hit.  So pretty much don’t spec into it when leveling then?
---
I hope you're right, but that may not be the case. When vanilla came out, most people were new to MMORPGs or online gaming in general and there wasn't many resources available online to guide people.
---
Now, there will be veterans, min/maxers, people with retail-WoW mentality and will rush to 60, more elitists, experienced players from private servers, and overall less patient people than 15 years ago. The only chill crowd will be (1) new players which will be a minority, and (2) people who quit years ago and want to relive the glory days.
---
At least, I am guessing it will be like this the first months. Then the retail-players might lose patience and move back to retail.
---
Thats pretty rude
---
I’ve been playing vanilla on pservers for years. I’d love to have a toggle option for MY game to look better. If you all don’t like it then hit that nifty “classic” button in the interface.
---
kek
---
how is that a yikes? that is what made wpvp great back in the day. It explodes from some rando ganking lowbies into a 60v60 war for hours on end
---
This is story of alliance. They wouldnt have won once if horde didnt overextend at very start and pulled guards. After that they ressed to death.
---
I remembered the guild name wrong and even the name of the server lol. Anyway, seems like the guild now has only 1 member, sounds like they disbanded. No way for me to find out my old guildmates.
---
Getting better is change
---
Need that MoveAnything!
---
People saying there's nothing new to document are wrong.
---
Spergs have yet to math out the 100% most efficient "X" on everything. Like, what is the most efficient mobs to grind for each level for each class for each faction for each race? Hmm? Yeah plenty of sites have a wide variety of grind guides but they're shit compared to my personal research. Do you know which mob is THE most profitable gold / hr to grind on as an undead rogue at level 31? Because I fukken do, since I've spent months now spreadsheeting this shit and running massive tests. This shit isn't on google and it isn't on any old paid guides. I ain't releasing any fukken data either until I "make it" as a youtube streamer or in my suicide manifesto.
---
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RETREIVE GOLD YOU DONATED TO HIM ON TUESDAYS.
---
Yep, I'm very turned off about Classic especially because of this toxic-slash-hyperpolarized behavior.
---
What amazing is that there wasn’t one fucking spec of lag. If you did this in Vanilla, your FPS would drop to 5 and the server would crash.
---
This is beautiful! I’m so pumped!
---
I mean that's kinda true for any fantasy writing. It's very hard to make a world with magic and ancient powers and shit and try to make a coherent balance of power and fairness and logic. If you think too hard about warcraft or lotr or harry potter or star wars or anything (christianity for example) it basically falls apart.
---
Which reminds me. Was that crazy guard spawning a bug? Or does it spawn 1 guard per horde player?
---
Classic is included with a sub ya noob
---
I'm feeling this hard. I've been trying to make retail work for now but I've just beat it to death and it's just not scratching that itch...
---
Until I looked into installing Warcraft 3. That is scratching that itch pretty damn good.
---
I also should mention if you pre-ordered WC3 Reforged you can install the original anytime! I didn't know this until earlier today and I felt like a total idiot when I figured it out lol
---
he wasn't really "filled with salt". he was just disappointed 'cuz he wanted his quest done.
---
Scrubs will be scrubs. Nothing we can do about it.
---
Shadowmeld CD is 10s, same as stealth, but not a shared CD. It could never be used in combat. Stealth breaks as soon as you start casting, a change made around 1.9.
---
Escape artist CD is 1 min with .5s cast. Gets rid of snare and movement impairing effects.
---
It should still be the 5s rule, but i havent played the beta
---
Well what do you expect? Retail is garbage.
---
What are stat priorities for a druid while levelling etc? I seem to remember reading that weapon damage is not worth anything, only stats due to animal forms. So in that case what stats do I want? Str? Agi?
---
I would hug and kiss all these men no problem.
---
I hope I’m right too, but from what I’ve seen on pservers and beta, the community is already more tight knit. The game encourages it on every level as well. 
---
You get a reputation for being a good or bad player and you can’t simply raid with a cross server group or spam lfr/premades. 
---
If you are shunned you have to reroll or pay to transfer/rename.
---
I can only speak for Shadowmeld, it's on a 10 second cool down and it cannot be used in combat. However, it's so easy to remove yourself in combat that you can run away and pop it as well as eat some food/drink while in shadowmeld. 
---
I believe you are not able to cast in it. However, it does allow for a brief second to appear out of nowhere.
---
Alliance had 2 full raids plus a few, Horde had just under 2 raids.
---
Not a massive difference by any means, asmon is just a crybaby lol.
---
Good to know, ty. Unfortunately i only played on the begging and than i had to stop cause of studies (later i played on privates but its never  the same thing). With this SP become viable since the start so its a new class i can think of playing as my first toon.
---
underwhelming screenshots
---
YOU ARE A BOLD ONE
---
lol that slow realization from him is gold.
---
You mean no time to grind while drawing... or no time to drind while grawing?
---
*steeples fingers*
---
Time to critique some strategy.
---
How many players on both sides?
---
I think it's doable. The issue though is that if you end up on a super try hard guilds server, you'd have to play insane amounts of time more or be able to get into the top premades of rankers and wait your turn.          
---
Otherwise it's highly likely you can get it assuming you can keep up with the grind again.
---
Won't be exact - retail has exponentially more going on in the background. Vanilla/classic was very simple from a processor perspective.
---
Oh shit, I forgot about that banks
---
The whole time Asmon kept bossing and shitting on everyone. "What are you doing you idiots!? You should be dead! Okay everyone attack, go, attack now!" while standing in the very back of the battle even though he's probably the best geared and most heal focused and tank specced. It was pretty cringe how angry he got and how dramatic he made the situation seem, he also wasn't very pleasant with the people who were helping him do his quest, he's always been socially inept like this though so it's no surprise, but he needs to change if he wants to maintain the popularity spike classic will bring.
---
CTRL+1 and CTRL+3 is all the micro you need for your pet.
---
if you get in and enjoy the game and the universe, this isn't aimed at you. this is aimed at people who didn't play, dont want to play, and still hate on it because its an old game and 'its just nostalgia'. of course those people are going to get backlash.
---
This was like King's Landing last week. Horde just dominated.
---
Post removed - please remove your request for private server examples, reply to this comment, and I will reapprove it.
---
Ironically it's Venruki... who forgot to ice block during BlizzCon and lost his team the game.
---
Yes, but do you want to read twitch emotes all day? ;)
---
Seeing retail players shit on vanilla for years with no real recourse can cause that. Now that the shoe is on the other foot a lot of vanilla fans want to kick back. I'm not saying it's right. It's just very satisfying to prove people who still believe calssic will fail wrong.
---
1. You are the streamer hating person youre looking for based on this post.
---
2. That was cone of cold and nova. His only objective with that flank was to lock them down so the other half of the raid inside the gate could push safely. And it worked multiple times.
---
Alliance also had a massive tech advantage, goblins didn't join til Cata.

Venruki is literally the most level headed streamer I've seen so far. Definitely not a "sperg".
---
You wanna see a sperg, watch asmon during the last hour of the battle and the few minutes afterwards (before he banned half of his chat and rage quit lul).
---
This is dalex\_live guys, so glad you all enjoyed watching &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
To be fair, it is a pretty nice ax.  Haha
---
Found the asmon sub
---
so glad you guys liked it &lt;3
---
The problem is shadowpriest's damage turns to shit when there's a dispeller on the enemy team, which there always will be in a decent premade. All their good utility like fear, silence, MC, mana burn and dispells can be done just as well by a utility spec priest that can also throw great heals if needed as well.  
---
Ele sham has way better burst damage and doesn't get wrecked by dispell, plus of course they provide WF totem.
---
https://i.redd.it/i0gxthy6ope11.jpg
---
im surprised by how much he remembers. dude is like 50 now. some of the "bugs" he reported were actually things that were patched before 1.12 and he didn't realize it like being able to switch armor in combat. he was arguing with his chat about it and they kept telling him it was never possible and then someone pointed out that he was right, just one patch too late
---
OP is a scrub with low IQ and the scrubs on this board love their BFA heroes, just sit back and giggle m8
---
That's the Barrens I know and love.
---
asmon is incredibly uptight
---
Nope, sorry.

If I'm playing DS/RUIN on a warlock do I have to cast DS every 30 minutes? Also is it viable to use DS for pvp and just play without your pet all the time for the bonus health regen
---
Play Shaman it’s the mirror image of Paladin and is an all round great class.
---
Why do you think it should be 80-90 hit? The video above shows them hitting for way less than that on a rogue.
---
Depends on queue timers. If they're long enough people will fly to close areas to world PvP in downtime
---
Watching this live was so epic and being able to switch viewpoints made it 50 times better lol.
---
I’m sure higher mythics do require real communication. But going 1-120,  doing normals, heroics, lower mythics etc and all, and only at +15 you start interacting with others? That’s a lot to expect players to do before they get there. In my days, you started social grouping at level 10 for Hogger or 20 for Deadmines.
---
They waited until he was streaming and then basically camped Asmongold for their own amusement and content. Total douche-bag move there.
---
I'm sick of every gaming subreddit devolving in to e-celeb garbage.
---
really? I recall paying for every expansion apart independent of the monthly cost. I haven't played in years so my account is inactive, but for Classic, I'll just pay the monthly, and no base cost to download it? That's awesome.
---
I don’t know why, but John Hight makes me think of the uncle who is a little too touchy.
---
Sounds pretty damn hypocritical. People want Vanilla but as long as they're the ones putting the sprinkles on it it's ok? 
---
I would agree with you if this was a single player game, mod it however you want, but WoW is an MMO. 
---
Some Add-Ons seem fine, like a different UI or bag merging, but others I'm not sure about. Like you say, not using it puts you at a disadvantage, which also means everyone who does use it has an advantage over those who don't. 
---
I'm just not convinced that Add-Ons are OK.

Asmon not using /yell and raid warnings more fucked his group coordination up, half of them likely werent watching his stream.
---
Skill
---
Vanilla WoW
---
Choose one lmao
---
It’s included with your current sub, kinda like  an add on to retail wow right now
---
Apologies, I've edited it.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Oh man that brings me back
---
He looks stoned in 100% of his pictures
---
Im really looking forward to that. My nostalgia is real, so i am either remaking my priest or my druid first, and buffing everyone i see.
---
That kind of thing is lost in today's wow. The random buffs, the mages making you food/water for a few hours of questing, hell even warlock candy.
---
Brill on the pvp server basically has a person sitting there making bags for mats, at least first few days! Loving that community
---
W H OMEGALUL
---
I subbed as well haha
---
But I heard blizzard is garbage and their shit servers can't handle more than like 4 vs 4!!??!!!!??
---
Lmk if you make it!
---
It's like different games are different
---
Is that leather hat...........comfortable???
---
My argument was never that mythic +15 was a valid replacement for all the communication of vanilla, just starting the fact they are empirically 10 times harder than cthun or nax.
---
Got a link to that part of the interview?
---
This isnt true GUZU and co. Were ganking that area before asmon got there at all, they both started forming larger parties and it turned into something massive.
---
Yes, I'm playing beta at 3440x1440 and it's amazing.
---
Man, I had so much fun watching these streams. So many moments made me smile and get hyped like a big nerd
---
the alliance did not have 2 full raids plus a few. they had 1 full and one just under half. stop being a retard
---
You think Blizzard cares where you’re playing? They’re getting your money anyway.
---
I think he regrets not making the push to r14 and staying at r13 originally so I think that’s a big motivation for him to finally make it all the way to r14.
---
Sexy fireman calendar but every month is Omar Gonzales.
---
pvers just trying to pve vs a horde of arena legends hmm wonder who is gonna win that one
---
but everyone told me that blizzard is garbage and can't maintain anything nore than like 7 vs 7 without servers catching on fire!!!
---
Loved every minute.
---
Dang, you know all the info that is 100% fact.
---
Huh? How did classic not sustain?
---
Nope, nothing transfers from beta to launch.
---
ElvUI will be available for Classic WoW:  [https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=4282](https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=4282)
---
Well silence is a 21 point investment so that's a bit deep for a healer I'd think (since everything else in there is pure Shadow)? And wouldn't a warlock suffer from the same dispel weakness? 
---
&gt; Ele sham has way better burst damage and doesn't get wrecked by dispell, plus of course they provide WF totem
---
So could a resto though right? Is their raw burst enough for them to be taken over their healer counterpart? 
---
Thanks for answering!
---
I was watching some Alliance streamers earlier and they made me appreciate the old days of WoW. They probably got their asses handed to them like 5 times and were just laughing and having a great time.
---
I don’t understand why people flip a shit when they are killed. Not worth it.
---
I disagree, he got to where he is by being everything you mentioned. Whether or not he is serious is difficult to tell most of the time. That being said I never saw this battle from his pov completely, so who knows. Fights like these are awesome though, especiallt with all the different big names fighting each other!
---
Thanks!
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and use some /r/AnthemTheGame logic and say
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature
---
He is they are in the tunnel, earlier ven found a break in the wall so he took and i quote "ten brave men" to flank and lock the ally raid down so that sony and crew could push through the gate easier without the ally running away (AGAIN)
---
Yes people in beta will start at level 60 at launch because you know
---
Yeah man sharding is a real fucking bitch, especially to people playing on ED. Shit is so lame. Even disrupts non-PvP RP events. Simply awful system.
---
We’re getting White walkers in Classic?
---
Nochanges!!!
---
I think it's mostly because asmongold just wanted to do his axe quest, not so much go full Horde Vs Alliance for that long. The horde PVP streamers knew this would be a great time to attack. People just love attacking asmongold.  To be fair, it's funny.
---
Except beta only goes to level 30
---
Remember the good old wall of NO regarding vanilla back in the day ?
---
He was in the top alliance raiding guild on his server prior to his grind to rank 13.  He stayed in it but didn’t PvE as much after he started the grind.
---
It makes me wonder though, Just how many alliance PVP server streamers will there be anyways? Nearly all the horde streamers I've seen are going on pvp servers, and most of the alliance ones are debating on going to PVE servers. Will we not get these massive raid group battles in Classic?
---
Revisited private servers but much like you I don't find that its scratching the itch for WoW Classic.  I log in to retail to see nobody on,  and just log back out and head over to Twitch to live though streamers.  August can't come soon enough!!!!
---
Level 70 then
---
As a night elf rogue I've been on the receiving end of that axe on an orc warrior. Not fun. :(
---
Retail servers would have taken a gigantic shit trying to handle this.
---
The good old days when you checked on the forums from people asking for help or mentioning you by name
---
Yeah its pretty brutal tbh, sounds like they are working in a solution though. Time will tell if it works. Wont need it soon tho, RIP retail lol!
---
Lolol thanks, man. I hope you’ll consider subscribing!
---
You don’t need to be convinced. If you don’t want to use Adobe, don’t use addons. That’s how it was in Vanilla, that’s how it should be in Classic. Blizzard is not going to disable a core part of the game because you don’t like it and don’t want other people to like it. And since this is often a group-based game with lots of coordination needed, it’s not enough for me to have every available advantage. Everyone on the team needs to have every available advantage or they won’t make the cut.
---
You didn't read the post...
---
The devs explained the reasoning behind it, they didn't want to utilize the old 1.12 client due to bugs and exploits on it that they would need to fix all over again.
---
BC will not happen because the way they found to circumvent recreating Vanilla does not work again with BC due to the BC client content overriding vanilla content.
---
Gold bet duels is the best. Better than arena.
---
Your mom is beautiful.
---
Of course I didn’t read that wall of text
---
I really empathize with the gold farmer. Cleaning up the English a little, he basically said this:
---
&gt; I pay money to obtain time
---
&gt; You pay money to obtain joy
---
Thank you for treating them kindly.
---
Is it still that one chick that's fit af?
---
It'll be available in phase 1. It's bis for priests until Nefarian
---
they literally said in an interview that theyre open to TBC and WotLK servers at some point as well....
---
Your opinion is not a public service announcement. No matter how important you think you are.
---
They have not mentioned Burning Crusade.
---
There were a few lags that were noticeable.
---
&gt;The important thing to keep in mind is that Vanilla doesn't emphasize instance mechanics or combat complexity.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;It's really more about raid-prep and managing RPG elements. 
---
This is why I love it so much.
---
Pretty sure they did in the tipsout interview I watched. They said they are listening to the community and it is up to us.
---
Try retail so you can have a well rounded comparison between both eras of the games. 
---
You will also gain your own sense of appreciation for each.
---
Nah multiple guards will spawn, It's what made the TM/SS fights such a clusterfuck; you'd get like 40-50 guards spawning in the big raids, which is what caused the frequent back and forths.
---
I think it’s cause he’s torn on PVE vs PVP. He wants to be on a PVP realm but knows his popularity as a streamer will just lead to days where he can’t play and stream since he’s getting camped etc etc but it comes with the territory of streaming. Shitty situation for him tbh.
---
Plenty of time to draw, he's levelling warrior!
---
It’s going to be a long 100 days if Classic is the only thing you’re looking forward too. 
---
My suggestion is to try to get out and stay busy. The worst thing you could do is sit on Reddit or WoW forums refreshing 100 times a day.
---
The best is when they go to support their argument and "insert private server name" is also used to support their position
---
I wonder if a Blizzard will ever have the ability to recognize what makes people happy in Classic and find a way to put some of it back in retail. It seems unlikely, but so did Classic.
---
&gt; making people (and Blizzard execs) change their minds 
---
Pump your brakes. Let’s see where Classic is after the holidays. Gamers love the new shiny until the next new shiny comes out.
---
Do you need to be subscribed to wow to get a beta invite? Already adjusted my beta settings  to include classic wow.
---
They're both old school veterans, they're immune to butt hurt.
---
I miss TB too much to watch their streams though :(
---
Why is this even a Thing
---
I literally just grind an area of mobs for 2-3 hours per level then move on and do this to 60. I don't even bother questing cause it's unreliable.
---
I think we also need designated non-streamer servers. Blizzard has already announced there won’t be a large number of classic servers; if a different large-audience streamer goes on each one, then there’s no where left for people who are trying to avoid that.
---
I deleted my first warrior after I ran far into higher level wolf and kept dying over and over.
---
I really wouldnt worry about it. I expect the few months to be a bunch of people relearning and just having fun. Very forgiving, in other words.
---
It used to be that you appeared on the enemy after the aimed shot actually deals the damage, that gave a huge edge in classic pvp, I was able to one shot clothies from shadowmeld with aimed-multi-auto shot combo. 
---
If it doesn't work that way I suppose I'll go for gnome mage.
---
No.
---
It'll most likely go up to 60 before launch. It's just limited for now. Mostly so people are less focused on speed leveling and more focused on testing. It also helps to bottle neck people for stress testing.
---
You could tell because all the lagspikes while questing.
---
Let's not speak in absolutes, lest we look like fools when proven wrong. And I say that as someone who doesn't need or particularly want TBC (despite it honestly being my favorite expac in terms of nostalgia) and definitely not WotLK.
---
There's a major, *major* difference between TBC/WotLK and Vanilla, and that difference is Cataclysm. Vanilla was essentially *deleted* from the game after Cata launched and revamped Kalimdor and the EK. TBC and WotLK, in comparison, were essentially unmolested by any future content. You can return to a place like Nagrand, and it will be almost identical to what it was when it first released. There are a few alterations here and there with NPCs or dialogue or whatnot, but the mobs are the same, the assets are the same, the loot is the same, etc. These places were also sequentially updated into the newer system because, well, they still exist. To rerelease Vanilla, Blizzard essentially needed to reverse engineer entire continents and deleted quest chains. To rerelease TBC? Well, I'm not saying it would take no effort whatsoever. They would still need to revert modern character models and such. But that has already been done with Classic. A relaunch of TBC or WotLK would be a lot less like "completely recreating a faithful mimicry of a currently nonexistent game" and a lot more like "artificially restricting newer expansions and reimplementing some old talents."
---
I'm not saying that they'll actually do it, or that there will even be player desire for it. But your argument is predicated on it being both (A) a financial disaster; and (B) a technological gauntlet. The former is not yet supported or refuted by, well, much of anything, and the latter is already mostly completed by mere virtue of it having never gone away to begin with.
---
Yes. It was. Literally played with it.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Spawn
---
Shaman main of 12 years here. I started playing 2 months before TBC launched so no true vanilla experience but I miss my totems and can't wait for classic!
---
Yeah it's 21 pts but 21 pretty useful points picking up blackout and imp psy scream on the way. 31pt holy is garbage so your only other choice really is PI which is decent of course but there's plenty of situations where 5 second blanket silence is definitely better.  
---
    
---
Nah resto sham is not a pvp spec. Mana tide totem is terrible and missing out on lightning mastery (30pt ele) means your dps goes straight down the drain. The shaman pvp decision is really just between between elem mastery and NS (ie putting your final point in ele or resto).
---
The big bulky ones are actually great, they just cost a lot. Those thin ones are a waste of money though, they don't have the cooling to make it work well.
---
I got DC'd once, but don't remember the entire server go down. Maybe just the zone server or something went down. In Redridge I was just getting lag spikes.
---
Thats just the standard for MMOs, has its benefits and issues. For me personally even if they charged like 20p an hour it's cost me my monthly sub in about 10 days rather than 30.
---
China charges/used to charge per hour played but only because the government made them due to people literally giving up on life and just living on WoW, they also introduced caps to playtime.
---
It's just one of those things to consider, if you don't feel like you get your money's worth you just don't play but it costs what it costs.
---
Jurrasic park 2, "don't go into the long grass!"
---
Same here, was watching both streams.  It was really back and forth, but Venruki's group won in the end.
---
This looks so sick but I’ve never played wow before so I know I would just get destroyed if I try get into it when classic is released.
---
Maybe if you are a totem twisting master buffing the melee group? Idk.
---
Man I have already lost 10 years of my life to this game, I don't know if I can resist the temptation to give up another 10.
---
Correct. Items, skills, talents, etc in the game are not going to be changed. What you see is what you get.
---
The WW weapons never had the same speed.
---
I was not Blizzcon it was the MLG championship during Wrath.  At the time beastcleave was broken and killing people in seconds, very difficult to react to if you watch the video of when it happened.  His team lost the other games too, it wasn't only his throw.  The moment is only immortalized because of the commentator: "OH AND DOWN GOES VENRUKI, HEADSHOT AND THAT'LL DO IT!!"

Your post actually revealed to me why I like vanilla ice cream the most now as I’ve gotten older! 
---
I want to get back to basics, back to the beginning: back to delicious, simple, no frills, no gimmicks, old fashioned vanilla.
---
Don't know what warfronts are, but Wintergrasp was a really good post-vanilla "battleground" I enjoyed the hell out of it. 
---
WSG I was never a big fan of.
---
The fights in BRM are going to be fucking EPIC.
---
People might join a server to play with a certain stream and end up like classic a lot and just keep playing the game. I know this isn't the majority of people but still helps balance out things sometimes.
---
They all had you on /ignore
---
Close enough mate
---
There's an addon to set-and-forget this.
---
Lol, same here. The guild I was in couldnt down him and guild leadership stubbornly insisted we down him before heading into Naxx. My primary desire is to finally kill him and get to raid Naxx
---
yes
---
When I leveled as horde mid wrath, I spent most of my time questing. It wasn't until mid thirties that I found out about questhelper.
---
It sped things up a lot - useful if you just want to *blitz* the quests, as my friends at the time insisted I do.
---
I think that, and leveling via dungeons was a terrible mistake, and I will *not* be doing that again.
---
I think part of the charm of questing for me was having to figure it out the hard way.
---
BONUS: I never quested beyond level 15 or so as alliance.
---
Hell, I never even quested at all in stormwind, due to ... *issues.*
---
If I can't figure it out myself and get frustrated, there's always google and wowhead.
---
This sounds incredible, and would be a cool feature to put in on servers down the road. Similar to how League of Legends has those whacky game modes a few times a year
---
The Southshore shirt made me happy
---
Yup same here
---
thank you
---
Yep, remember the Wall of No? Retail players have been shitting on anyone who even suggested the possibility of legacy servers for years and took pleasure in telling people it was a horrible game and it will never happen. Talk about toxicity.
---
I’m bringing my gf along for her first wow experience. 
---
I’m just not gonna tell her there’s pve servers lmao. Gotta have the suffering to get the full experience.
---
PinkSparkles on Twitch, I believe.
---
Albion online is great and you should totally buy a month of premium. After the first month it’s pretty sustainable to use in game currency to buy premium. The economy and pvp is great.
---
It’s helping to keep myself hyped and not burn out our spoil my experience on a pserver or beta.
---
A Wrath baby is complaining about not being privileged, shocker.
---
I miss the days where stuff like this was an article rather than a video, there's no way these points take 30 minutes to convey.
---
It will probably lag at certain points, but the thing you have to remember is classic wow has a lot less procs and abilities being processed by the server. In BFA you not only have a shit ton more passive procs through talents and spells, but also armor, trinkets, etc.  And a lot of those have conditionals ontop. That all adds up massive to a server overtime. Not to mention the particle and spell differences. It wouldnt' surprise me that the newer versions of (blizzard, arcane explosion and flamestrike) utilize magnitudes more pixels. All of that adds up.
---
Another point I just realized is how every class in modern WoW has 1-4 dots. 
---
TLDR: Classic should have less lag then modern WoW due to less pixels on spells and fewer procs for the server to have to handle. Be pumped big 40v40s should be back.
---
Scrubs .
---
A spammable "select nearest friendly player with curse/magic/disease/poison and remove it" won't work anymore.
---
I Mained a holy pally and creamed priests in 3's.
---
Link?
---
That's the exact server I played on lol. No wonder xD
---
I imagine this is actually what the game looked like for most people in 2004 lol
---
Same. I was trying to wait but I know I will never get into beta and 100 days feels like an eternity.
---
How do u know when u get in?
---
Ok thanks for answering.
---
I don't know man, I like the constant feeling of danger in the world. Yeah of course I'm going to die occasionally, and some of those times I won't stand a chance, but I personally think it adds a lot of character to the game overall.
---
&gt;Let's see if Classic will still have those fights a year after launch, because AD has been doing it for ages.
---
I have no doubts that people will start cross-roads raids and Orgrimmar/Ironforge raids again just like back then
---
I’m 21 and actually started playing in legion “I know its a bit odd “ but after playing the game for a while thought the game was too easy and didnt felt like a true mmorpg and after seeing that all those people who shares the same opinions with me and saying vanilla was the best i felt sad and felt really bad about not even experiencing the wotlk times so im truely hyped
---
&gt;http://multitwitch.tv/
---
Being intro/extraverted has nothing to do with being smily and happy...
---
Ahh that makes sense ha.
---
It very much does you can get away with a lot in AV
---
Most of the players in Asmon's raid weren't capped at 30.
---
Kill hogger? Ha. You misunderstand my intentions.
---
One of my first acts in this game will be to deliberately sacrifice myself to him.
---
*It has been far too long.*
---
If your pet isn't face pulling extra packs you're doing it wrong.
---
Keep making your content, the only reason I got back into Classic WoW is because of watching your videos and your genuine enthusiasm about times we all thought were long gone.
---
How are you gonna burn out 3 monhs before release with a level cap of 30? It's
---
Just a chance to do a dry run and confirm class choices...
---
I used bartender for most of vanilla and will do for classic, it's still no changes tbh.
---
Add-ons existed and were used heavily in vanilla, it'll be no different in classic and in some cases (omen for example) unless they actually implement a working thread guage you won't be able to raid without it. 
---
Don't see how it's hypocritical to continue to use the same things you used in 2004 at all, it really is no different than using talent calcs like we used to. They add to the game yes, but they aren't anything new that we didn't use back then.
---
Oh, they'll definitely bring people who stay around. For sure. I just don't think it will be enough long term to really bring much of a balance to a server in the long run.
---
If it was regular wow streamers and wow streamers then I'd expect it to work out more. But They'll move on and so will most of their viewers.(Well that's just my guess) I say that with 0 shade towards them. I like Shroud and Tim but I don't see them bringing a lasting population that could compete with Asmon on a particular server I guess? 
---
Then again. I think Asmons viewers will bring a decent amount of balance because as many people want to play with him there's a lot that will want to go after him. It'll be fun to see how it plays out regardless.
---
I hope. Deuff limit is removed post naxx. Its not really needed it just limits builds for raids.
---
Shamans are actually the same pink color as Paladins in vanilla, this got changed in BC when they were no longer faction specific.
---
Hope this takes off.  Fantastic idea.
---
It's all about the money, companies have found ways to squeeze more money from people that work. I'm willing to bet RS3 makes Jagex waaaaaaaay more money than OSRS even with more players.
---
Well since you're playing on PVE server (since PVP servers don't allow but one faction per realm per account), there's really no disadvantage or advantage.
---
Outside of PVP, the interaction between Horde and Alliance is so minimal, that you might as well have the characters on different realms.
---
I don't know about that. Part of the atmosphere of MMOs is that all the players see the same environment which you can see. Otherwise it is not really a shared world. Becomes more like a shared protocol
---
Hmm, I'd say at least 49/50 pvp encounters have been positive for me. And yes, most of those times I died, but I really enjoyed the extra feeling of danger in the world. I agree with samsquamchh, PVE servers just feel empty to me.
---
Oh and by the way, I hate competitive games in general. World pvp in wow is one of the very few places I actually enjoy it.
---
Check out tomorrow's weekly "LFM Monday" sticky.
---
Ah yes another thread bashing on Tips.
---
He literally does the quest on stream without fail, this post is pointless.
---
That would be awesome tbh
---
Whatever server and guild these two are on, I want to avoid.
---
Yeah, Horde might have had a little more but Asmon's group was basically any swinging dick that wasn't a level 1.  They were really desperate for bodies.
---
It's funny to watch Horde kiddies sperg out over this, as they usually do.
---
"And now you're all mushrooms bye"
---
if the stress test is a lot more open there should be some world pvp
---
prob be the best testing about lag we will be able to do during beta
---
Fwiw this doesn’t happen at a large company without having the blessing of people running the show in the first place. Yes it let the project go forward, but they deemed this important enough to take a senior engineer off of working on something else of comparable importance so that he could work on a prototype.
---
I played on a pvp in vanilla cause I 5hought you couldn't pvp in a pve server. Lol
---
\&gt;  but here me out
---
current wow yes. vanilla nope.
---
It’s funny because you can look back at reviews of vanilla when it launched and they were stellar. 
---
Pcgamer gave it an 81% I think. And for an mmo I remember that score was incredible. Even Ion said Blizzcon exists because WoW did so well. Vanilla launched Blizzard into a billion dollar company. Period. 
---
This is why I found Blizzards stance on it to be so fuckin weird. Rose tinted glasses? No. You guys made an *objectively* good game. Just because something is using oldschool rpg mechanics does not make it bad. Look at Baldurs Gate. Or fallout 1 and 2. Still great games. 
---
Watching Blizzard call their own IP bad because it was old, to me, was the lowest I’ve ever seen a company go. Way worse than the diablo 3 fiasco. 
---
Modern Blizz logic applied to chess. 
---
Listen guys, we know you like the old version of chess, but thats just rose tinted glasses. Modern chess is way better. You can buy back your defeated pawns now, and even get buy backs on losing. 
---
You think you do but you don’t.
---
It’ll show up in your Battlenet launcher and you’ll get an email
---
There aren't any yet, as far as I know. Besides that, once there are they will just give you minimap dots, you still have to find the right spot to click on the ground. When you're picking up pinecones that are shorter than the grass, you need this setting turned down or it takes twice as long to finish the quest lol.
---
Please someone help, i don’t know, is it this true/false now?
---
“RMB == china money you know”
---
yes. you can save it for when needed. :)
---
no idea about vanilla but private servers as long as you got the last hit it worked. im assuming its correct now. and yeah it doesnt seem worth. warlock leveling is way different from pservers to beta
---
He's dead right about that. Blizzard flew in the Nostalrius team specifically to discuss the possibility of creating classic wow, because they saw how successful vanilla private servers were.
---
Like ten years ago yeah.
---
It's literally the retail players starting every fight. Have not once seen it the other way.
---
Go fuck around on a private server if you're paranoid.
---
Warfronts are essentially a battleground against AI, where the enemy is just NPCs. It’s pretty much a guaranteed victory. I’ve never seen us lose a warfront. The rewards are generous, but the challenge is nonexistent. 
---
It’s a shame, because they retextured both Arathi and Darkshore beautifully for this, but made it too easy for us to care.
---
The demo iirc was running on the legion client, which may be at least why it's different. I can only say it felt right, but don't have numbers. Hopeyou get more info!
---
Well as I'm not an expert on Add-Ons, is there one that say, adds auto-looting? 
---
If there's one that tells you where to go exactly on a map for quests, doesn't that defeat some of the point of classic? 
---
If some QoL takes away from WoW, and yet the players voluntarily add it back into the game through Add-Ons (when possible), is that not against the philosophy of Classic WoW?
---
So you want some asswhipe with 50,000 weenie lickers following him around on your server? Every server will have one.
---
Yeah that's probably the key difference that splits people into pvp and pve servers. A lot of us think it's a necessary evil, it's a price you need to pay for the full experience. Sometimes you get ganked and it's a waste of time. For us the open world pvp threat is inseparable from the whole of the experience, it keeps you more alert and more invested, making it more rewarding. You occasionally need to out think or out play members of the opposite faction and it's an added challenge, an extra layer. You also have the freedom to just go and try to slaughter some guy that is being a pain in the ass. The pve experience feels like it's missing something. That's from my personal experience anyway, but this is why there will be a choice.
---
Well deadmines is a shit load harder for sure what with the bosses working properly
---
Too much snot in there man
---
If you want it, you'll have a bright line pointing you exactly where you need to go. [Example](https://i.redd.it/76ptn7y9dyy21.jpg).
---
Instead of posting a big comment here, I made another post about it so I'll just link it here. I believe something is off with the melee range/hunter deadzone range of non-Taurens.  
---

---
**Its a real shame the servers just up and died during this 80v80 battle in Arathi today because the new servers can't hand..... OH WAIT!**
---
Mechanic had 15...he ended up pushing them back to the hate with just 15 ven wasn't to happy about it.
---
Kinda sums up 90% mass world pvp. Exciting at the time but it’s anti climactic because the bigger Zerg nearly always wins.
---
decide what your main focus will be in game (PVP or PVE tank/heal/dps) and narrow it down to as few as possible then research those couple to see what you like
---
It would have to be an instant 60 for that. And the only active one I know isn't eally good for testing since everyone runs around in full T3 BIS
---
proving them wrong through action (the game succeeding, for example) is much better than making rude comments and negative posts about them. i have seen far more people on this subreddit make negative comments about “classic nay sayers” than i’ve actually seen classic nay sayers. most comments on the wow subreddit have been generally positive with people being happy that classic enthusiasts are being given what they’ve wanted for ages. i just think that we might all be being a tad dramatic bashing modern wow and it’s fans.
---
The numbers I always hear thrown around are roughly 3000 concurrent.
---
I predict retail to significantly die when classic comes out, and I'm guessing that even when there is a lul in classic, retail won't gain the numbers because it would just feel like a waste of time, no one really wants to put in time into 2 different mmo's. RIP retail 27th augest boys.
---
Except you can retrieve ALL the gold that ANY person donated. Oh man.  
---
Or, he keeps the gold but progressively gets better at life. New clothes, weapons, eventually becomes R14 if you pay him enough.
---
Watching them as a duo is painful, they are both horrendously inefficient. Any time Asmon gets started talking on a topic he just presses 2 reflexively and stares at chat, no matter what is happening on screen. His bars are a mess and his inventory makes me hurt inside. Esfand wastes a ton of time fucking around in town and causes people to wait on him constantly.
---
I like popping in on Asmongold for the big spectacles but the smaller guys are much more pleasant to watch actually play the game.
---
Because they had to give us an expansion.
---
No, I like the bare bones less clutter vanilla spell effects
---
Orb of Deception
---
yes you need to sac every time you die or it times out. its fine for AV but nothing else really
---
Talent? :p
---
Last person to pay topper gets gold on the tuesday... imagine the swarm around him at 11:59pm monday
---
They have some serious work to be done before the AQ40 gates open.
---
I've always ever played on pve servers and never felt like anything was missing, then when I try pvp servers and have my experience that I'm used to interrupted, it's incredibly annoying.  I don't know, I just really don't see how constantly being killed by someone without the chance of even fighting back is enriching to your experience.  I'm sure it's different when you're both max level but most of my experiences have been while leveling.
---
Holy shit lol.
---
Real talk: You'll be able to know whether you like a class by level 10. You don't need to be max level to tell. The classes all feel *very* distinctive in Vanilla. The only caveat to that is that hybrid classes will more often than not oblige you to use their healing specs for raids, so don't expect to be killing stuff in endgame with them.
---
But by level 10, you can feel what a Warlock or Hunter is like with their pets. You'll know what it's like to cast spells as a Mage. You'll know how healing will feel on any healing class.
---
Classic isn't BFA. Vanilla is all about the journey.
---
Streamers ruined classic for me. Never mind classic beta ruining games lmao
---
Will elemental shamans be any good?
---
[!!](https://images.app.goo.gl/YPcpATBft783DEPA9)
---
I'll be making a priest, mind controlling you, and jumping you in to the lava below. :)
---
I dont think hard is the right word. Classic hasnt been hard so far, but theres defo things you arent supposed to solo.
---
Classic requires effort. It also requires you to be involved with people in most everything you do.
---
"IS IT POSSIBLE THAT BLIZZARD HAS A BUG IN THEIR GAME?"
---
"NO, IT'S THE TESTERS WHO ARE WRONG"
---
don't just sit there, i've been rolling each class to 20-25 on a private server. it's easy, it's so fun, and you actually get a real sense of the class simply through those first 20 levels. 
---
plus, even if you don't end up rolling a class, the time you spent getting to 20 on each class will give you a deeper appreciation of them when classic finally launches.
---
most non super tryhard guilds will bring 1 spriest
---
This thread aged well....
---
This is just hearsay brother, i may be going fast but this is nothing more than that and i am fully aware.
---
How did I forget that?
---
I love hearing a mage say “BOP me I’m going in”
---
Quality video
---
https://pvp.henhou.se/
---
You can practice every class with good gear on this server and it’s popular.
---
That's the thing. I kinda wanne do everything. For me classic is a PvP game that you need to do alot of PvE in. I always was a DPS main throughout my wow life but recently noticed how much of an adantage it is to atleast have a tank or heal spec so you can farm your DPS gear more easily. 
---
I even tried to narrow it down more be telling myself, since I will be playing classic for a looooooooooong long time, I want the option of a legendary item to be aquired. Which didn't really help either.
---
General consensus is no in pve as they run out of mana too fast. For PvP they can be decent if they run the ele/nature's swiftness spec for burst and offhealing when needed.
---
But play what you like, you'll enjoy it regardless
---
Each week? How tf do u have time to level 10 levels and farm BIS in a week?
---
Was one of the first action bar addons.
---
Wheeew I see drathal's hud such an amazing addon I can't wait to have it again
---
Honestly it may not be possible to avoid streamers depending on how many servers they will have.
---
Also I know people coming back will start to stream.
---
The question is, can you pay with two forms of payment when buying sub time, and can you add amounts down to the cent to your account? You won't really save any money if you're forced to throw another $20 on your account to cover a sub.
---
Yeah you'll have to base it off of stats instead of iLvl so it's more like Statscore.
---
I am scared shitless to play anything, but a healer.   I feel like DPS and Tank might be boring in a raid environment.
---
I was the shadowpriest in our premade back in vanilla. It was so fun, the combo of burst, CC and support made my team like having me around. It helped to have great (BWL+) dps gear.
---
They can defend flag room along side your rogue in premade wsg.
---
It was also the only ally city with an auction house for a good while
---
They already nerfed dungeon gold farming in 1.9.  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Instance\_limitations](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Instance_limitations)
---
It's going to be 3000 per layer, which is similar to the server cap in live vanilla I believe. They said they aren't releasing the actual server caps so as not to influence player decision, but there are definitely caps.
---
When they merge layers we may have much bigger servers on average than what was in live
---
Addons are fine. They're optional. If you don't like a certain addon you can just not use it and go about your day. 
---
This whole idea that everyone must play and experience the game exactly the same way as you is incredibly stupid. Diverse addons was one of the greatest strengths of vanilla.
---
Well , I can say that from my time fiddling around on a certain max level P server. That I really enjoy Rogue, Warrior, Mage and Warlock. But I'm stuck on those 4 and switch every single day and can't make a lasting decision
---
Less time to play before the twins get here.  
---
Instead of 3-4ishmonths, I only get two :(
---
Full adulthood will finally have set in at 28.
---
True but with 16 it got easier to get a spot.
---
That’s not something that would work and would backfire, if done so directly.
---
Let’s say it happened, the people that are wanting to avoid the toxic parts of their communities join said server to get away from the big streamers.
---
The streamers may not join it, but the toxic people that want to ruin those players day? They will all flock there “just to prove a point”
---
So such servers won’t work, it has to be a community choice, or just knowing who is where at the start. Dedicating it (making it official) will just cause harm.
---
If TBC does happen to come, we need to put a list together of all the shit things that ruined wPvP and social dynamics.
---
Hey thanks for your hard work
---
I've read all your responses. Your a person who wants to be able to do "everything." Your just like me. It why I almost leaned more on the hybrid classes. Choose Paladin or Druid. I'm still deciding whether I want Paladin or Druid. Haven't decided yet. I leveled both to 30 on a private server. I enjoyed aspects of both.
---
Included in sub, or included in BfA?
---
One is no additional cost, one is buying the latest expansion
---
druid perhaps.
---
getting TF or the staff well good luck with that :P
---
personally i dont want anything post naxx unless its done on separate servers specifically for that. the whole reason classic was made was to preserve classic as it was back in 2006, kind of like going to a museum and seeing an old piece of art, but if someone started adding artwork to the art piece then it wouldnt be properly preserved. but id love to see them do TBC and WotLK.
---
Which came way to early. Hardly no one had finished the content of classic when TBC came out.
---
Obese, hairy bab,y laughter. lol
---
 It deceived you.
---
I wonder what TB would have to say about classic
---
[you better watch your mouth ](https://imgur.com/a/r5agCPo)
---
I have been fiddling around on a certain max level P server for abit and have narrowed it down to Rogue,Warrior,Mage and Lock but can't decide between those 4 and keep second guessing my decision , mostly because they all have such great advantages in some areas but are lacking alot in others.
---
I think that could be pretty heavily abused for other purposes. I think the teleport is kind of a necessity. But as I said, I think they should *enocurage* people to form their own groups. Remember those satchels with a blue item, and the 5 extra bars of XP? That should be a reward for playing with people on your server and in person, not via teleport. 
---
Holy shit, remember when they added a 1-3 stacking buff that gave you 5/10/15% damage health and healing for every stranger you randomed with? They literally encourage you to not play with friends. How did I not realize how blatantly fucked the game was at that point.
---
But how is it a standard when so many other mmo dont have the system where you pay for time and it ticks offline?
---
I left out some details because im not sure what the stance is on talking about private servers on this sub. Im not sure "promoting" private servers is allowed so i was purposely vague.
---
I think horde had higher levels, alliance were basically inviting anyone
---
I know that its not really likely but JUST having the options is really appealing to me. Having the chance at getting something not everyone will have is something really special you know ?
---
The team was flown in because they did great work behind the scenes technically to make it happen. They didn’t fly clown ass players in to hear what they thought.
---
You can get a trinket from the STV fishing contest that transforms you into a fish, which is pretty cool
---
9001
---
seems like thats something weird to be vague with but ok, keep your secrets
---
Yeah, like 5 man difficult dungeons and a neutering of LFG would go along way to help Wrath. Maybe, instead of the 2 daily badges coming from a random heroic, it could be a random mythic. (No +)
---
A buddy of mine was in on this and he said it was the most fun he has had in WoW in a really long time. This kind of shit almost makes me want to sub to try and get a beta invite, almost.
---
Guess you've got three months to make that decision. I think you should base it on what you want to do. If you're primarily interested in PvE, then go Warrior or Mage, because Rogues and Warlocks have fewer available slots in a typical raid comp. If you want PvP, then Rogue or Mage is probably best, but the other two work fine (Warrior especially so if you have a healbot at hand). If you're looking to enjoy the level grind itself, then Warlock is the best and Warrior is by far the worst.
---
He really has no one to blame but himself, he had to know this kind of thing would happen on a PVP Realm. His saltyness was a bit disappointing to me.
---
It gets better as you level. We are one of the slowest classes to level but we get a lot of utility. You can kill a few at a time if you use your abilities correctly.
---
Bruh...Did you see those INSANE cold snapped 200 damage cone of cold back to back crits?
---
IMO. If they add content it should be to flesh out out the game, adding more items to support specs that don't have many.  Add content for all levels and never add items higher ilvl than naxx.  Raids at the same ilvl as naxx, lower, but never higher.
---
20 percent cooler?
---
But can he do it in ten seconds flat?
---
Why is what a thing?
---
That retail Server sucks so much
---
i get it but TF is going to tanks first so you have to be one of your guilds warr tanks if you want it and getting the bindings is rng ontop of that.
---
We will get a lot of this in Southshore/Tarren Mill before battlegrounds phase regardless of streamers (tonight reminded me a LOT of 2004). Streamers will just make it a bit more epic by having multiple views of the battle. I'm actually wondering if rolling a server with even streamers on both sides might not be better then avoiding them entirely.
---
It won't be hard, it will just require a lot of time. That doesn't mean it won't be fun ofc.
---
if they add gear it will completely change the meta and class balance
---
I love Brian's passion when he talks about Classic.
---
Yup! Most fights are won by having a good initiator, actually initiate. So long as the allies are paying attention and push aggressively.
---
It's not hypocritical. People want vanilla the way it was. Addons existing was the way it was. Therefore it's consistent to not mind addons in ones vanilla experience.
---
Poor argument.
---
I wish I was feeling druid but sadly it doesnt do anything for my in classic. I hate both the races aestetics and the actual gameplay of druid in PvP isn't really for me either sadly.
---
Really, out of interest which western MMOs use a pay per hour subscription? I've literally never played one.
---
Lol, its not that i care, just not sure its allowed. Ive just seen other people be hush hush about private servers on this sub. I might be wrong. Anyway I explained the general concept, I dont see much point in explaining the specifics. It wasnt a 1 to 1 blizzlike private server obviously.
---
It's the same servers... 
---
More likely if you look back at retail item squishes. The No1 reason behind that was server lag. Having everyone hit such massive numbers all having to be calculated server side takes its toll. - I'm not defending the possibility it's not don't efficiently. 
---
I look at Classic and see a much simpler game running on the latest lean game engine with much lower numbers. (thus much less computational load on the servers). Now factor in the fact all our computers are night and day more powerful you can see why you had no lag.
---
Nah thats way too much change if anything have monthly events giving sweet rewards that already exist ingame
---
yeah, he was probably killed during global LOL 
---
like obviously he should've expected it and blah blah and he most likely did.. but you cant just come into arena and not press any buttons
---
They hate their own game just as much. Now they have twice the audiences to unload their shit.
---
Many classes feel like garbage at low levels. Shadow priest, sub rogue, druid, all feel very different at 45+ compared to lvl 10 or 20. Just dinging 60 can be a massive change for many classes. Most shamans probably level to 60 enhance and then respec straight away dramatically changing their playstyle.
---
If you're bringing fury warrs pre naxx you have a weak team. Good luck on vael

I mean... that depends on what you did in Eve online. Small gang PvP is one of the most challenging things you will ever do.

Null sec blob fest is anchor and hit f1....

But I do appreciate your analogy.

Every modern shooter would like to have a word with you.
---
PVP happened on a PVP server, what a travesty.
---
Add nothing
---
Offer TBC servers

Stories from back in the WoW day are always great. I started when I was about 13 and was the same, had no idea what I was doing. I made a warrior and got to level 13 before I saw a level 60 Warlock on his dreadsteed. I was in complete awe, I asked him to show me his pets and he summoned a doomguard. I made a warlock after that.
---
Got a ghoul skin tunic from clearing naxx trash with my guild at the time.
---
I ended up keeping that armor LONG into TBC before eventually quitting, just because it had so much damn armor and good stats. It eventually got replaced by some armor I can't bare to remember.
---
Hehe, I played Horde on that realm :p
---
Sadly we were only the 5th or 6th best Horde guild, so we were one of the guilds who lost a lot of players to the better guilds, when they needed new players. So we only got a few bosses into Naxx
---
But it’s fun seeing something from back
---
again i think he wasnt really upset, he was acting a lot, he cant just always be positive or negative.. he has to be both

Hi, /u/0mahaNightblade

Ever been hit with a quiver? That shit probably stings.

/thread
---
And the baby rage emote lol
---
This might actually be a saving grace if its decently active. Thank you very much for this.
---
The easiest way is making raid content that isnt a tier above. Just different loot. Zones will be out of the question
---
You cannot use it to buy game time.
---
Hi, /u/Damnmage
---
You just fucked up hard, you can't use these to buy game time.
---
It's in the 1.12 client on private servers. There's no chance they got that wrong. They had to guess on stuff that was located server-side - stats, etc - but the 1.12 client is client-side.
---
Deleted my last reply. It was meant for a different thread.
---
Yea I know its not actually a realistic goal at all. But like I said , its something in the very back of my mind for the very distant future.
---
I don't think server queues at launch are going to be an issue because of layering? If I'm wrong please correct me.
---
Even Destiny streamers are getting beta access before the rest of us...
---
Of course but everyone else went on the pvp server. It's actually pretty cool to see all the streamers and such all on the same server. I assume he just knows he's the main one to get targeted like this and accepts his fate lol.
---
I'm sure he  Knew it would be fun but it took longer than he thought for the quest I guess and started to take too much time and wanted to at least get the quest done and didn't finish before he had to leave is probably why he is so salty. I mean he does seem to want to go on a pve server on live though.
---
!Questie is the vanilla quest helper, works the same though pretty bare bones and buggy and autoloot existed anyway, but ye there's add-ons for most of the core mechanics that were in WoW by wotlk because blizzard used add-ons to develop the QoL updates over the years.
---
And people want different things, but the main thing is WoW nowadays is just so unsocial yet classic can't be by design. So unless someone makes a LFD add-on and everyone starts using it I have zero issues with add-ons. 
---
I won't use questie because that's how I find the game the most fun, but my guildies likely will because a lot of them are from TBC/WoTLK onwards and simply won't enjoy reading every quest and losing time searching areas. 
---
There's no one size fits all.
---
Ven was dueling in the street and didn't seem all the upset about it..
---
Kazzak with 4 raids , 1 frame every 15 seconds
---
this needs more upvotes -- THIS HAS TO BE FIXED! i've waited far too long for old stealth to return.
---
if classic launches with non-vanilla stealth animations, that's almost as bad as launching with new character models.
---
just before they made their final push esfand hearthed to IF to respec holy... delaying everyone another 2-5 minutes. holy paly is useless too lmao what a fuckwit.
---
You won’t see it on Asmons stream that’s for sure
---
Leveling, they do fairly well later in the game.   As dps in the raid, they're not very good.  In pvp, they're pretty beastly with endgame gear.
---
He would go total cynical brit over the flaws in the game and we would love him for it. Damn... I miss him :(
---
She is an undead high elf, so that's probably why they didn't give her the regular high elf model
---
It doesnt matter what you choose as you will have from aug27 2019 till the end of time to play what ever class spec race faction you want, unless you are one of those people that feel the need to rush everything to claim world first for stuff that was already done 15years ago then  thats on you but imo dont stress itll be fun if you allow it to be
---
I was in the battle for Arathi today and had such a blast, man. This game is magic... Cheers to you, first priest to 30. All the best, my friend
---
Arena is the peak of the wow PVP skill ceiling, but wpvp will be a breath of fresh air
---
I feel like avoiding them entirely would be a bit harder but if possible, probably so. That way the influence isn't too one sided haha. Maybe? It was pretty cool to see multiple viewpoints. Was a pretty cool event to witness over all. Shame soda wasn't in it. And tipsout had to be tired af
---
except it's doing this on the PvP server. go check literally any of the big streams.
---
Pay the court a fine, or serve your sentence.
---
Your stolen goods are now FORFEIT!
---
:&lt; Bring back the days of Blue Plz! Man I miss TB.
---
Private servers can handle it because that is all that's going on, there aren't 10,000 others questing, fighting, crafting and so forth also clogging up the server.
---
Gaming sweatshops, that's why they banned it over there.  Probably not bad money for the time in that area, but the government put a halt to all of it
---
This topic will always have mixed opinions, as there's one part of the community that wants TBC instead. However, a horizontal progression of vanilla (long time enough) after Naxx could be really cool, if they went on to finish the zones and raids that were originally planned for vanilla before Blizzard chose the vertical progression path. Some things such as karazhan could actually be quite easily ported for classic as the layout exists already, and places like Grim Batol could be remade as a proper raid.
---
I'm not judging based on asmon's reaction, I'm judging based on what I saw on screen.
---
That’s gonna be a no from me dawg
---
Really hoping current wow attitudes don't migrate to classic. Haven't seen much of it so far, but beta is a closed course right now. I don't have high hopes.
---
Bro........ The rogue combo points isnt a bug. He mouseover kicks. assuming you dont know what that means, mouseover macros use an ability on a target you have your mouse on . He never untargets his main target. If you swap a target in the beta you lose the combo pts.
---
thats a cool thing! but doesnt work when you have a vertical monitor in the setup, at least not when its in the middle of it.
---
Wpn dmg does nothing.  The best wpn in the game for cat druids is the crowd pummeler in gnomeragan.  I am not sure what the stat priority is though.
---
So that's not how computers work. If your doing 50 damage or 500000 damage, you still are pushing that larger number into the same 32 or 64 bit register where it does performs the same instruction in the same number of clock cycles.
---
It sounds like the beta is able to handle these large groups much better then retail and I don't know why but your explanation is incorrect.
---
It's illegal in china now, since 2009
---
Can confirm
---
Laughs in purge
---
So nothing will have changed.
---
right....
---
what's your personality? obviously these classes are all damage dealing. but do you find a lot of joy in bringing utility to the group? or would you rather just put your head down and slam the bad guy?
---
also, remember that a big part of the game IS 1-60, so dungeons and grinding should help inform what you want to do.
---
if you like to bring utility, you can't beat the mage IMO, but the warlock is obviously up there as well. the only thing is that the mage will be expected to make lots of water and food, and the warlock will have to grind soul stones. if you don't like keeping track of soulstones, nix the warlock.
---
what do you find more satisfying, melee damage or spell damage? that could help narrow it down more.
---
Cries in “guys please you have to kill the shamans first they can heal and purge please ok I’m dead”
---
It’s a great way to learn to play WoW, you just have to know that there isn’t much quality of life. Things are far away and take a lot of time. The grind is real. It isn’t made for casual lazy give me everything now players. If this sounds right up your alley, then WoW Classic is just for you.
---
Don't know. 
---
3k per layer.  Potentially multiple layer per realm.  
---
Supposedly layers will go away during phase 1.
---
Doubt it.
---
Things can change.  Plenty of people would love to fight the enemy rivals they've made during the pre-BG period.
---
Also, there should be enough interest in BGs initially to make realm-exclusive BGs viable (in terms of wait time and variety of enemy teams).
---
Let's be optimistic and say that a non-blizzlike feature like xrealm won't be the only type of BG we'll see.
---
This is why they have the beta. No reason to be “disappointed.” Thanks for catching it though, good person!
---
Kind of defeats the purpose of going back doesn’t it..
---
FOR THE HORDEEEEEE, and such.
---
its not even about just wanting TBC, its about wanting to keep vanilla as it was as that was the entire purpose of blizzard making classic in the first place
---
This is true, the difference tho in the old TM fights was typically you had lvl 50+ players that could actually kill the guards. These guards were hot shotting people left and right.
---
Shroud have said in the past that him and soda would play together in classic (this is from memory long time ago when shroud played alot of pserver with soda and stuff)
---
Amazing, thanks for this
---
I can only speak to my expierence on a private server but, while leveling I found enhance go be very strong. It was strong as hell in pvp. It's only a weak meme spec after 60 because of people itemizing so well. Enhance just doesn't scale well at all compared to all the other stuff.
---
So if you wanna be ele/resto. At 60 you should be good. You will be weak during phase one. But when BWL tier drops you become pretty playable. Not top tier but good. Then AQ40 and on you will be a monster.
---
Home boy has 3 months to fix a lot of fucked up shit. I'll vote for him if he pulls it off.
---
When I played Rshaman in vanilla, I always stuck to mail, because I didn't want to take the cloth from the cloth wearers.   Shaman are the only ones that can use mail with int on it.   If you take all the cloth gear from the cloth wearers, then what do they use?
---
That was my line of thinking back then anyways.  I am not sure how I would change now though.
---
... no? but, how do you propose to force every single streamer onto a single server, or, force streamers *not* to stream if they don't play on the "streamer server"? that's just fucking ridiculous.
---
assuming everyone has the pull of Asmongold/Sodapoppin is ridiculous. you do realize they won't even have this many viewers when Classic actually releases, yeah? Asmongold/Soda only have 60K+ because the Classic Beta has a very, very limited population. 
---
streaming, right now: shroud has 20k, esfand has 6k, venruki has 5k, strippin has 4k and then it drops off a huge cliff.
---
Fuck streamers, but yeah 1-30 was a blast!
---
They’re having a stress test next week where I’m sure they will invite a lot of people to figure this out.
---
Spell batching
---
Even if population balance allows for same server bgs, I highly doubt blizz will do anything to have that be the preference. If they did premade vs premade thatd be nice.
---
Unfortunately I think it is good reason to be disappointed. This problem has existed on live WoW for over 2 years now; I report it about once a month, but it has not been fixed.
---
Same here!
---
Effort *is* hard nowadays...
---
I theorize the server capacity for BFA is significantly portioned off with the sharding. The total amount of computing power on Blizzards end has only increased. But at the same time, they have set up their servers to accept hundreds or even thousands of shards, instances and battlegrounds etc. So when you pack 50-100 on one shard, their servers cannot focus the required amount of computing in one place.  
---
In classic, each continent has their own server, then you have the instance and battleground servers separate. Each of the continent servers are designed to accept thousands of players at once. The relative increase in strain by having 50-100 players fight in one location, will not strain the server to a point where the delay becomes unplayable.  
---
There are also allot less instances of damage and healing occurring.  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz1\_DLm3mCk&amp;t=304s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz1_DLm3mCk&amp;t=304s)   
---
In this video. 40 players facing 40 players are constantly dishing out aoe healing and aoe damage effects. Each 80 player is potentially dealing damage to 40 targets, for a total of 3200 instances of damage per global cool down. The actual amount is likely much lower however, and it is inexcusable that you cannot do 40v40. But no doubt, BFA is significantly more straining on the server. I bet if you faced 40 priests vs 40 priests, spamming holy nova, it would lag just as bad.
---
Not spell batching. Video evidence was provided, it's not difficult to click.
---
Ganking players half your level isnt exactly "world pvp". Get 60 and go fight in WS/WPL instead of being a bot.
---
I saw the whole thing from Guzu to this too man, completely lost track of time it was so epic
---
Blood Elves having green eyes wasn't a lore thing until TBC. Blood Elves and High Elves looked identical in Vanilla.
---
That got fixed part way through vanilla.
---
dude it’s just a beta.   The game is coming out August 27. You will be able to play it then.
---
Asmond just hopping around the whole time rofl.
---
Willing to wager he's leagues better than you at basically any game he tries.
---
&gt;	shouldn’t of
---
Hi, /u/We_Dont_Like_You
---
As someone who has gotten a considerable amount of beta invites (and sold a key or two when they were key accessible), I’m massively excited for Classic and thought to myself, “with all of the beta luck/access I’ve had, I’ll get one” - I kind of accepted the fact that the beta access I **really** want, I won’t get. 
---
Touché, Blizzard. Touché.
---
Yeah they for sure targeted certain people for the beta, but I guess it's whatever
---
Yea, averaged about 400 until maybe Wrath?  It was down around 170-200 from then on.
---
You got downvoted for asking a question, lol.   Best at pvp is tough.  Probably warrior, if you have a healer friend.   Best DPS is warrior.  Best Tank is Warrior.   Best healer is priest, and paladin a close second.  
---
Vanilla was basically world of warriorcraft.  Most classes were barely competent at a single role in a raid, while warriors were best at two.
---
Would an alliance player get a lot of mail int drops? That sounds like a great idea.
---
Probly Diablo but most certainly not wow haha.
---
And I dunno what other games he plays I don’t think he’s played league and what are you offering in this wager? And what’s he maining warrior I bet you  5k if he plays warrior I will parse leagues higher then he ever will ;)
---
Cool thanks
---
If you're someone who never played classic, it can definitely be considered hard, or at least challenging.
---
A lot of players are going to be going from being used to soloing every thing, to dieing the first time they accidentally pull an extra mob.
---
they targeted people who had an audience because they could get alot of feedback from alot more people without actually having to flood the beta with players. theres also alot of people who arent media / streamers who are in the beta, actually a majority of them arent, but you just dont know about it because theyre not public figures
---
The way it is sometimes a very small delay and other times a big delay (like 0:30 in your eg) makes me think this is the case. Basically you see the pet as it is on the server, so the command has to go to the server and back to your client to update meaning with 50ms you're seeing a pet doing things 100ms after you tell it too, and then on top of that you have an extra 0-150ms or whatever of the server tick happening that can delay the process as well.  
---
The examples you talk about where the pet reacts instantly is when the pet is purely client side and ignore all lag, the same way character movement and jumping does. Even with 500ms lag it happens fluidly and seamlessly because you're just seeing the local client render not what is actually happening on the server. While that may feel better it may actually be more annoying in some situations where you don't know what your pet is doing on the server.
---
Didn't even know it was out but your comment made me curious.  I'm not coming back, but if I did it'd be for that Ursa taunt, lmao.
---
Overwatch, r6 siege, csgo, TF2 and several others are all objective based. There are objective based game modes in almost every shooter, those that don't have one either have other ways to keep players engaged like quake champions' movement and control of armor and weapons, or they just provide a death match mode.
---
The dude has a point.
---
No
---
&gt;we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test it doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test. We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game so that we have the right mix of players to ensure great feedback toward making WoW Classic the very best experience for the community.
---
They never said it was random and in fact openly stated people would be getting beta rolled out to them slowly over time with specific criteria.
---
Gold farming that bad? I really want to go 30/0/21 shaman. Focus mainly on pvp but PvE as a healer every now and again.
---
This and The toxic thought process of “why is _____ in beta?” Like because you played vanilla you have some sort of authority over who gets in before you is insane.
---
moo caught with his pants down
---
Not saying that everything that is reported isn’t a bug, just that quite a bit of the stuff being reported (Tauren hit boxes, some starter gear having no stats, Warrior regen) is stuff that people either forgot or private servers got wrong.
---
I don't care about beta testing, especially in games like wow. Even thought I am super stoked to play classic as I did in 04. I do not want to burn any fun out. Even tough I am a huge fan I'm not trying to level up and in a few months do it all over and "act" like it's the first time in a long time. I do not envy the streamers or beta players, go for it, I'll have my fun for the first time when it's not burned on beta for no gainz
---
No, you don't have extra mana to dps.  If you tried you would do almost no dmg, and likely just slow things down by drinking more.   This obviously changes after you outgear the content drastically.
---
Sight. Twitch clips are useless on mobile....
---
I think our hype kinda sets this tone a bit tbh. Obviously not intentional but we are all talking about returning home, but obviously it’s just a good game that anyone can enjoy
---
They mention something similar in the known issues list found [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-beta-known-issues-list-5-15-19/173883)
---
Not necessarily. They could add gear for the weaker specs, and do it in a way that doesn't disrupt the PvP meta too much. This wouldn't change the class _balance_ per se.
---
What's the difference?
---
I just think Omar gets the meme love because of his quite handsome appearance.
---
I mean, come on, he looks like Tony Stark, who the hell doesn't want to look like Tony Stark?
---
you bet your ass every streamer who participated in this is dropping like 2-3 videos of this fight:) so i wouldnt worry about it.
---
Reminds me of the “host” issue when playing halo on Xbox live. The person who started the party is the host and he has no latency but everyone else experiences a delay
---
Nah breh it does tho
---
Also a diablo fan. 10/10 name
---
My worst fear is a huge launch then getting stuck on a ghosted server in a few months.
---
I saw a guy today on twitch walk into the tavern in brill, and say the music was wrong. The tavern music wasnt wrong but he submitted a bug report anyway.he asked chat and everyone unanimously said it was the right music because brill tavern music is iconic, but he still reported it and got upset when people said to not send false reports. People just cant seem to figure it out
---
So where is this and is that jump some kind of shortcut?
---
A sub for a small chance to get into the beta seems like a bad purchase to me.   If you got money to burn though, more power to you.
---
Stress test is not for your enjoyment. It's for blizzard to test the servers. Remember that.
---
Probably, I'd rather have my subs test the game vs people that may not play.
---
In the meta at the time it was unreasonable to expect that much damage, was likely a perfect storm of windfury procs and BM pet crits.  It's mostly a testament to bad game design with regard to the hunter/enhance comp at the time than to Venruki's lack of skill as a player.  The guy is a world champion and one of the best mages ever to touch a keyboard
---
We want the most accurate recreation of classic.  When a design does not match up with with the private servers or our memories, we report it just to be sure.  It seems that a lot of people in those comments interpreted this article as people submitting bugs that the game behaves in ways that we don't like and that the game is not as good as we had remembered.
---
NO COLLUSION

Goblin rocket boots

Game time isn't recurring, that seems to be the only difference. https://i.imgur.com/3tXG6ab.jpg

Your stats are static, they will not change dynamically no matter what you are doing.
---
If I recall correctly,  the answer is no.
---
You can xfer shit using the neutral AH.   Say stonescale eels are going for nothing on the alliance, but really high on the horde.   You can buy them on the alliance, sell them on the Neutral AH, and then buy them with your horde character.  It's kind of risky though.
---
Well, a smart rogue might
---
theres like 2 big streamers. Shouldnt be that hard to pick a different server.
---
Meh.. streamers.. gg on 30
---
That's how crossroads was pre BGs.
---
Why do you doubt it?
---
It's an old game, so almost all the CPU processing takes place on a couple threads.  And there's a lot to process in MMOs.   This is why single threaded CPU performance is king in such games.    Any relatively new PC won't have a problem though.
---

---
My biggest fear is ninja looters, that's going to be annoying leveling up. But should level out in the 50's as most will have quit and gone back to BfA
---
right. im 100% playing, but i understand what you're saying. not sure if i want to sub just for a stress test. along with the fact it may be too late to sub and not get in to the stress test.
---
It's not too late, every wave they check if you're subbed or not. More than likely they will be inviting people from opt-in &amp; subbed accounts first for the stress tests. If that's not enough players (which might be the case for the last stress test where they go all out), then you can bet they will have a proper open beta for a day or two to really try and crush the servers.
---
You deserve a beta key!
---
If you know the KT fight, you should know there are a lot of variables that can lead to the DPS meter not being what it might look like on this guilds, say, patchwerk.
---
I played quite a bit in vanilla, but didn't really start raiding until BC....were paladin tanks not a thing then? don't remember needing a warrior specifically, but then again I was a warrior, so I never really had to search
---
Except when I go to redridge, everyone who is in redridge is there. I can see everyone, I can kill any horde gankers. 
---
In this version, I might not be able to fight a horde ganker who is ganking my friends and it’s just not one consistent redridge for me to defend. 
---
Yes I get it, there will be horde on my layer ganking, yeah there will be plenty of action. It’s going to suck to miss big raids on the other layer, stuff like that is what bothers me. 
---
I’m still happy and gunna have a great time, and honestly imo there’s still a lot we don’t even know about who it’ll work in terms of changing layers and populating the fresh layer ect. 
---
It’s not the same. On fourth gale I get a whisper that redridge is under attack, I swiftly ride and start my patrol. Adding a layer adds a weird and very new dynamic to classic. I will still defend redridge and wait for it to go away, but I’d rather just defend 1 redridge instead of layer hopping
---
thanks!
---
Pserver vets have been at the top of their game for years. A lot of no-lifers are a real force to be reckoned with
---
You can maybe play feral in a raid, and it will kind of work, but the amount of work you have to do to farm consumables is quite ridiculous.
---
This gives me hope for wpvp and city raids, hopefully they cut dhk and it'll be great.
---
From one hunter to another, thank you so much for doing what you're supposed to do in a beta test. People that don't play pet classes don't get  how important these mechanics are. For anyone harping on spell batching, this is not a spell batching thing. Spell batching does not change the responsiveness of a spell or command client-side. A spell batching "issue" (feature?) would be if the pet was able to intimidate a mage exactly as polymorph went off, resulting in a sheep stunning a gnome.
---
[deleted]
---
they seem to only be using the beta for advertising, so its not like an actual beta
---
Do you remember if the shared experience is lowered for having a higher level character with you?  I can't recall if that was a later added thing or not.
---
You must delete this
---
You can believe that if you want to but it's pretty much objectively false.
---
Can I be your friend? :)
---
they can do ok in dungeons but they are not a thing in raids
---
Well of course they are awesome, but... do they have BIG DICK MAHGIC??!
---
Just curious if you’ve tried it, or possibly reminding you if you’re still interested
---
\*just.  $15 a mo for a remake is quite insane if you ask me.  I guess you get BFA with that too, but I consider that basically worthless.

anyone that thought Blizzard wouldn't give streamers priority is fooling themselves. first and foremost, Blizzard is a company and they want to make profit. the only reason we even got Classic is due to BFA being so poorly received. if BFA had more positive reception, Blizzard wouldn't of even considered Classic.

The hardest part about playing a pvp server is telling your parents you’re gay

Yeah no problem,  I remember running through deadmines with a max level paladin trying to gear my twink rogue... ah those were the days :)
---
23, started in late vanilla, only raided properly in tbc. Can't wait to make my own guild in classic and fail miserably hah
---
Druids are the worst healers iirc.  Priests dominate the horde as far as raw healing goes.   Paladins are far better healers than Shaman, and offer better utility as well.   The horde kind of gets screwed in that regard, but shaman do okay.  When they can use chain heal, they can compete with priests, but not really otherwise.
---
You know, ive noticed this on my warlock on live and its driven me insane a few times.  I never realized this was a newer problem, and i thought i was just losing my marbles...
---
That's impossible!
---
Great job man. Upvoted. Hope this gets looked at.
---
I don’t see the allure to beta, unless you’re one of those people that have never played WoW (I guess).  I have access to beta and never plan on playing it at all.  I see zero point to it.  Played through all of Vanilla excluding Naxx already (most of it 100x over), and have no interest in reporting bugs.  So why bother when my character is going to be deleted anyway.
---
Would rather save my giddy excitement for when the real thing launches instead of playing to level 30 and wasting that excitement on what?  Playing through levels 1-30 in Vanilla, which I’ve already done?  Utterly pointless.
---
sm/ruin is much better for pvp because it makes your dots a lot more powerful and nightfall is a huge boon when you multidot corruption.
---
Damn I have to think and do???
---
Making offspecs more viable will affect balance. Any item they add at level 60 will affect this, for better or worse. Unless they are all just shitty items.
---
So this may happen but we have to take into consideration the time layering will stay, might be only for 1 month. Then lets say you see so an so is under attack in /world or w/e, then you ask to be invited to participate, will you really even notice the difference between layers so early on? with a pop of 3k.
---
been on it for awhile but i still haven't seen anyone that i played with yet =/
---
What do you mean "easier to level on Classic than they were on PSers"
---
Ammo: once you get an 8 slot bag for ammo you will very rarely spend enough time away from a vendor before filling your bags and needing to sell. general goods vendors are your best friend; you can find ammo in some odd places, including a 10 second walk from the bankin downtown Stormwind. the money isn't noticeable, you don't get your pet until level 10 and by then you should have plenty of extra silver.
---
Pets: attack, stay, follow. there is some micromanaging but it becomes second nature. in PvE good micro makes you a lot more efficient in grinding and killing multiple mobs at a time or stringing kills together to save downtime. in PvP your pet becomes your bag of tricks. /u/Minkelz is right about the pet skills. look into [Petopia](http://web.archive.org/web/20070408182332/http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/html/articles/skills_list.shtml#claw) to learn what pets to tame. basically you have to tame and use new pets to learn abilities to then teach to your main pet. Petopia also has a list of all pets attack speeds (1.20 cat with %30 attack speed bonus, claw, bite, normal attack = dead casters)
---
This right here. All classes are viable in all roles. Just not all specs are optimal in all roles at endgame. Also, remember that playing alts can bring different experiences that can fill the holes in the deficiencies of your main like being better at farming, PvP, raiding
---
I watched a guildie of mine from live play for a bit while i was at work on friday.  
---
It was kind of nice, but made me sad that i cant play, and probably wont get in for a while since i started in Wrath :(
---
I think people have it mixed up though. I don't think having an 04/05 account makes you more likely to get into beta.
---
I saw someone say they started in Panda and got invited. They are grabbing people from ALL eras.
---
Blizzard's wording has made people go as far as to say that you're being invited in order.. Which is insane, and false. It's led to salt. "I'm an 04 day 1-er and I'm not in yet. Bullshit."
---
Yet I see false statements spread on this sub even "Looks like they've done 04 and 05 so far, 06 might be next week!"
---
If you rank you can get good gear 
---
You’ll wanna do MC / Ony / ZG Tho still for weapons and trinkets and stuff 
---
If you’re undergeared then geared warriors will be two hitting you and that would just be annoying.
---
Decided to try finding old glitches from vanilla to see if they’re still in, had to start with one of the most well known.
---
If anyone has anything they want me to try doing, open to suggestions!
---
If you do everything with respect for others (even when they don’t deserve it) it’ll be pretty hard to get a bad rep
---
Well done Sherlock :)
---
do explain why that's the case. I'm curious on your well thought out reasonings that exist apart from "STREAMERS GOT INVITES FIRST DAY REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
It is
---
looking forward to that for sure. as someone who started during warlords of draenor, ive heard tales of what WoW was like when it first came out and that sounds exactly like the game I want to play
---
Dont forget tíbia premium currency
---
When it comes to gearing up late game, for a guy with a family and 40hr/week gig, is it worth doing PVP at all? Or will I get much better results from dungeons/raids when I can?
---
I got downvoted into the nether by retail players when I said you shouldn't be given a free piece of mythic gear every week.
---
Can we get a "streamer free" server?
---
It’s obviously intentional on retail
---
I don’t want to nitpick but in WoW attunements mean something else. The word you’re thinking of is scaling. In WoW, attunements are pre-requisites to enter a specific dungeon or raid and WoW does in fact have those depending on the dungeon.
---
I don't think we have the same understanding of the term _balance_. Ret paladins are in fact so imbalanced that they are effectively absent from the level 60 meta altogether. Imbalance isn't balance anymore than atheism is a religion. Improving the gear choices for ret pallies and other meme specs without causing them to surpass or necessarily even challenge the other specs does not change the class balance.
---
For launch? Of course no new content. A few years down the road? It could add some fun replay value.
---
Its venruki now
---
actually, it’s to get players to stop playing on private realms and to have them pay a subscription again lol.
---
I'm going to have extra fun during the stress test just to make you angry
---
As long as you report it they will most probably fix it! Keep up the good work!
---
If you squint your eyes it looks like a screenshot with high contrast
---
&gt;Is there really going to be a saturation of Warriors in vanilla? At 60?
---
Probably.  They're kind of OP in Vanilla wow, and the private servers only made the problem worse.  The armor values they listed for bosses were too low, which gave people the impression that warriors are more OP than they actually were.
---
Kinda amazing how you didnt learn your weapon name in Legion where you only had one weapon for the entire expansion. I smell bullshit.
---
But yea, lfg was a good idea to begin with but then it evolved and got out of hand.
---
LFG as it existed in TBC was fine. Great even. Instead of spamming a chat there was an UI where you could show that you are interested in a dungeon, or look at groups that are forming for dungeons. Then you join groups or create groups by messaging and talking to players you find in the UI.
---
The only info provided by the UI was lvl, class and name (as well as what dungeons the player was interested in).
---
Very cool of you to say.
---
Thanks a lot! I’ll definitely play around, perhaps hold off demonology until being able to pickup SL. Can’t wait for the release!
---
He is indeed like a chubbier, mildly Hispanic Tony Stark. Antonio Starko.
---
You actually believe esfand is good, dont listen to this guy
---
Id most likely not participate due to life commitments but yes i do understand what stress testing is lol is why i asked
---
I mean, they exist? I'm glad they're there? A lot the classic UI elements are atrocious from a usability standpoint and I'm absolutely going to build my own. Playing a balance/resto Druid in world PvP would be straight up cancer without macros and mods.
---
Blizzard is not THAT stupid.
---
Here is a prot warrior guide for classic: browsed it and seems legit from what I remember
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-warrior-guide/
---
oh yeah youre totally right. got the words mixed up. thanks
---
Yeah I'm sure they are throwing out some random invites too, but from what I've been able to gather a pretty large chunk of the first few waves of invites they sent out went to very old accounts which is in-line with what blizzard stated. So there's really no reason to feel slighted for not getting an invite + it's been out for only a few days and I'm sure they'll be rolling out even more invites as time goes on.
---
Yep they are much more competitivethan it used to  you can't do it without a good team with voice chat
---
It will be the same in most classic servers, if you aren't good enough to compet with the turbo nerds you won't get any honor and then won't be able to get rank 14.
---
Myself and two guildies have it. One is streaming on twitch now and then.
---
Honestly not really, I've only taken 3 classes to max level but each one was extremely satisfying. I can't think of any class that I would really hate playing, either leveling or endgame.
---
It should be:
---
#showtooltip Battle Stance
---
Forgot. I'll go now. Takes about 30 mins. Brb
---
well there you go :D
---
Warrior hp regen is much higher than it was on private servers. You regen from 0 -&gt; 100% in about 1 minute with no buffs/heals/consumables, just your base regen. So if you spend 15-20 seconds travelling between mobs to kill them (which you often are in vanilla density/respawns while levelling) you literally never have to stop.  
---
[Watch Monkeynews regen from 50 to 100% in 30 seconds after ressing.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/426825434?t=01h38m20s)
---
Im glad to hear you say these things. Sounds amazing!
---
I am just afraid you will be disappointed it wont be the same again. As an example: Raiders wont be aiming to get full T1 because most of the sets are bad or the individual pieces are bad.
---
People also wont be asking you where you got the item (probably), they will either know where to get it or google it. Same with talents, people today dont use their own talent builds, they google what talents to use and use whatever build wowhead or icyveins recommends.
---
But even without all these interactions we remember so fondly there are still plenty of other amazing things to look forward to. Like the name regocnition you mention among many other things.
---
Lol... Yes they are.
---
Survival build Hunter: Improvise, Adapt, Overcome
---
Why did you register for the beta then, I thought the checkbox was unchecked by default.     
---
Personally I have not played wow since 11 years ago and don't feel like playing the current game at all. I would like a refresher, check the classes for their feel again so I pick one I like when the game starts. I have also not done the content 100x time over, I basically played 2 characters mostly and played them at highest level then so I am actually not really familiar with lower level content which is fun to explore when you are capped at 30.
---
Servers look on point, I guess the batching was the problem on live servers.
---
So which top guild are you/have you been in?  
---
I've been around the Oce scene for a long while so I'd be interested to know, because surely someone so confident they're a better player than someone with legit rank 1 parses/gladiator ranks must have played at a pretty high level at some stage.
---
I don't think their mounts are "free" though.
---
Blizz rarely goes out of their way to make things cooler for us, if its more work for them. If they plan to have cross-realm bgs, they will be cross realm from day one.
---
Over the last few weeks I have slowly had to accept my place as a Boomer, take me back to December 2006, level 37 Orc Warrior, with all the SM gear in Grom Gol, blasting Rammstein.
---
It was an Alliance, there were leaders not a single leader. It was not until the High-King title that a central figure was appointed, which was in wrath i think? So each person classifies who they follow as their chosen leader.
---
There is the other side of who was the hardest to kill in a city Raid, and the answer was supposedly Magni due to many factors. Since Iron forge was the most central city it was often seen as the true alliance capital, and the most populated.
---
seems like you're getting way too worked up about this
---
You misspelled fat.
---
I’m they’ve had over 12000 on server concurrently. (At peak) just sayin
---
I am so glad to hear you have these thoughts as well.
---
If anything what im most happy about at the moment is that my thoughts on modern MMORPGs are not just me being old and cranky. I am going to take a much more casual approach to Classic than i did when i played during vanilla/TBC back in the day and just enjoy the fact that im finally able to play a mmorpg where there is a world, not just a bunch of UIs that send me to different instanced content.
---
I really hope that Classic does well, not because im overly fond of vanilla WoW but because im overly fond of the structure it had and the core values in a mmorpg that it represents. Hopefully Classic does well and we will either see future WoW content adapt or other studios releasing games that are more akin to Classic than to BFA.
---
Well, if im wishing for stuff i may as well wish that Classic becomes an alternate Warcraft-timeline where Blizzard develops original content within the Classic spirit.
---
But that's like 99 days away.
---
He admits to being a notoriously sore loser. Shortly after the Deadmines run where he broke 100k viewers and got $7k in donations in the span of 5 minutes he whined and sulked cause a hunter tracked him down and ganked him twice.
---
So what did it do?  I can't remember.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425939728?t=09h51m10s
---
At 9h 52min Soda is fighting the panther. 
---
The panther hits alot harder than anything in SM:GY
---
Hunters are fantastic &amp; required in organised PVP.
---
In raids they are very much important (needed to tranquilising shot bosses and do certain boss/trash pulls because of their movement/ability to pull from 41 yards with instant shots).
---
Being a Hunter in raids is seriously fun if you enjoy making things smoothe for everyone else.
---
Your dps is good in phase 1/2 but it never gets better. They are very much a support class in the sense.
---
41 yards is 37.49 meters
---
I want an azeroth based expac where the power creep is smaller than TBC and they never introduce flying
---
Otherwise keep everything else, just do it in azeroth. So have kara and raids based on the new zones they create
---
&gt; Not to mention the particle and spell differences. It wouldnt' surprise me that the newer versions of (blizzard, arcane explosion and flamestrike) utilize magnitudes more pixels. All of that adds up.
---
These effects are client side, not server side.
---
Thanks for the replies guys! I think I'm just gonna go for it. and deal with any inconveniences it brings.
---
I alt tab ALL the time so that could play a part in it but I can make it happen without alt tabbing.
---
My laptop is a bit on the old side, it can run retail with like 20 fps in the world with low graphic settings. How well can I expect Classic to run?
---
I think the BGs are coming in phase 2, so it probably won't be worth doing for gear, unless you can no life it.
---
You don't need an active sub to have/play PTR. It says active as in my account being flagged for Legion PTR.
---
Oh god that is embarrassing that I couldn’t recognize those
---
I literally cannot bring myself to play anything else now. I hopped on retail to ironman and it just isn't the same. I can't get my fix.
---
Good investigations! It is pretty important for blizzard to look into this.
---
What happens when gear doesnt get good unless you are running high lvl raids
---
The announcement page is all anyone has to go off. You'll find out with everyone else in 3 days.
---
Yes I was 100% for old school graphics but ever since I tried the new updated graphics I have been blown away.  The barrens feels so much bigger with the updated version!
---
we dont actually know
---
the wording is the same for the closed beta they have nkt stated its going to be more open
---
it would make sense if they allow anyone with an active sub log on during the stress test or just totally open to the public but they have not clarified yet.
---
like the stress test are 2 day sessions so this implies they will either be open to more people for those 2 days or there will be stress test only invites.
---
tbh ill be salty if i get an invite just for stress tests
---
You havnt seen him play Path of Exile.
---
You would have no issues farming gold with that spec, but your healing would suffer in raids a bit.
---
List of Known Issues:
---
Classes and Combat:
---
    Hunter pets may not immediately return to your side upon entering passive mode
---
PvP is timeless dude, yes
---
Ages exponentially better than PvE lol
---
WTF?
---
Which is why PvP servers were so popular
---
lol, these unpopular opinion threads are never unpopular.
---
I am not sure if the alliance would get mail int items.   I kind of doubt it, but I am not sure.  My memory is crap, but I think that was an issue early in wow, but the devs changed it so the horde wouldn't get paladin items, and the alliance wouldn't get shaman items.
---
True but I think its inevitable to an extent. WoW still got constant patches for years and people knew new content was coming. Classic we kind of only have a certain amount of content. If they don't keep it fresh, people probably won't be on as much as we might think.
---
I would argue generic leveling encounters are indeed more difficult as well as slower. But I get what you are saying.
---
I literally cannot bring myself to play anything else now. I've been checking to see if I've gotten in like every other hour. I hopped on retail to ironman and it just isn't the same. I can't get my fix. I NEED MY FIX.
---
The 22nd needs to come quicker.
---
One issue that doesn't get talked about much is nerfs pre 1.12. I'm quite curious about this myself. Were all of them documented, or were there stealth ones, I remember "stealth nerf" being a concept back then, atleast in our guild. If you were a semihardcore/hardcore player back then, you would have engaged content before they were nerfed/fixed. 
---
One extreme example of a documented nerf is [Scholomance](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Scholomance_(original) ). Read the section under difficulty. I think those nerfs were in 2005 not 2006 and despite the talk about 10 man, Iirc it was always 5 mannable. 5 manning was preferrable for more loot per person (most of it total crap in the beginning) and maybe you couldn't do quests in a raid, not sure. There were so many mob packs tightly packed and there would be patrols just in the right places to mess you up if you didn't play very carefully. The humanoids fled to get more packs if you let them. Also it was common for atleast one person in the group to be sub 60 for increased aggro range. It wasn't impossibly difficult by any means (if you knew how to l2p), but it was deceptive and tedious even for better players and you started to get respawns fairly quickly if you fucked up.
---
So if the last time you saw scholo was during first few months of Vanilla and you see the new version you might be a bit confused. The first version had a bit too much trash mobs I think.
---
90% sure it's sarcasm mate
---
Get  to ashenvale, take boat to wetlands and proceed to run , there’s a corpse GY exploit people used to do but idk if it will work in classix
---
Included with sub. No additional cost no matter if you own any expansions as far as they've said. :)
---
yeah i know and i agreed with him?
---
Literally the same but backwards
---
I definitely don't know the specifics of what they did but here were some of my speculations. The blizzcon panel last year was a very very good place to start if you want some more specifics. At a high level, the game was built on hardware and software (like the operating system, databases, drivers, etc.) that do not exist anymore. In order to run it 1 to 1 they would have to replicate the hardware or at least use an emulator. The database, operating system, etc. almost certainly would have tons of security holes that were discovered after that time so reverting would be a security nightmare. Also, the new server and client software likely dont know about things like +hit or other values that dont exist in the game anymore. You need something else to translate those values into something that makes sense to the new game engine. The other big thing that I can think of is that the modern client and server likely have massive tie in to their development, testing, deployment and load balancing infrastructure along with their billing, gm tools, etc. Using the old software would require replacing all of that. From what I have seen of the beta they did a really nice job in a short period of time so I think it worked out for the best.
---
Nope. Me getting access to the beta doesn't really benefit blizzard in any way, so I'm certainly not entitled to it just because I've played the game for over 10 years
---
Not loading for me. What happened?
---
You run and die, then run and die some more before you run into more death. Eventually you stop dying but have to keep running.
---
So, is that a quality of life thing that was changed for the re-release?
---
“Hey that’s not Donovan Mcnabb...”
---
It depends on if they let people start out at level 30 on the stress test. I doubt too many people will be able to level to a decent level and engage in world pvp in 2 days.
---
to be fair he is right but a lot of the popular streamers dont stream for that many hours a day 
---
i wouldnt be surprised if there is a number of streamers wiling to stream and pvp 17-18 hours a day
---
how many hours a day does shroud stream?
---
Ran this on a private server. There may be some difference in Classic but I can't see it being significantly different. Takes about 30 minutes.
---
1. Stormwind
---
2. Deeprun Tram to IF.
---
3. East to Loch Modan.
---
4. North to Wetlands. This may or may not be a private server trick, but once you're through the first tunnel into the Wetlands you can throw yourself off the cliffs and it will bring you to the graveyard about halfway through the Wetlands. Someone mentioned that this didn't work in the Beta but I can't confirm.
---
5. Run all the way to Menethil Harbour on the West side of the Wetlands. This is really the only portion where you will likely die a few times.
---
6. Boat to Auberdine.
---
7. Boat to Darnassus.
---
No because I'm an adult and understand that the world doesn't evolve around me and blizzard sure as shit does not owe me anything besides a functioning game at launch.
---
Agreed. I've found that if you give people the option to be dicks, they'll do it 9/10 times. I just wanna level and grind without getting camped or interrupted every 10 minutes cause some player's definition of fun is killing someone half their level over and over again.
---
You didn’t answer my question about what he’s playing? And I’ve been in adrastus which was a top 10 world guild all through original vanilla, and for recently I haven’t played wow for a long time. I was in scared of the dark which is a top tier oce guild on alliance. Ranking 100% parses on every fight. On a resto druid.
---
We don't really know anything. We also don't know if they'll take away access from the people who were in the stress test once the dates have past.
---
Have you tested melee leeway distance?
---
Im gonna have a terrible time just to offset your fun!
---
Sw &gt; tram &gt; if &gt; run to wetlands &gt; boat to darkshore &gt; boat to rut theran&gt; portal to darnassus &gt; ??? &gt; profit.
---
He says if his viewer count is solid throughout wow classic he'll be pushing for rank 14
---
Hmm. What exactly do you mean by leeway? like the range at which you can still melee? or what
---
Shroud said he would get Rank 14. Then he said if stream numbers do well throughout, he will get a high rank.
---
What do you do with pve twinks? Solo dungeons?
---
TIL introverts cannot experience happiness.
---
Take the deeprun tram from Stormwind to Ironforge, then run east through dun morough, and north through loch modan. You should reach the wetlands,  follow the road west until you hit... mithril harbor? I don't remember the name. Take a boat from there. I'm pretty sure that will take you to Aberdeen or Theramore. There is a flight path or a boat ride from Aberdeen to the island where Darnassus is located. That's my best guess.
---
Same. That’s some cruel and unusual punishment. Give me 2 days of access and take it away? Imagine not getting stress test invite at all. Which is worse?
---
Old Ironforge?
---
Ahh yep, I'm doin more research and I just saw that the R14 grinds wont even be accessible until Phase 2, so that idea's out. Thanks.
---
I'm rolling there to gank asmon
---
Now we just need the Star Wars galaxies emulator people to do the same and finish it up
---
Dude mark this nsfw...
---
even if they are level 10 it should load up the server if they are all in 1 zone
---
they wont be able to get kills but it should be enough to simulate lag
---
you need to load up the server in general to try and simulate this sort of lag we are looking for
---
if the server is at 10-20% capacity it likley can handle more people in 1 zone firing off skills. obviously a good sign if it was not laggy for sure though
---
FAKE! There’s no selection border around the warrior class icon in the bottom left, and the icon is a penis not a sword. Nice try, but my IQ is way too high.
---
Streamers are the gameing magazines of today. Handing out a key is an add. 100k people watched Asmongolds DM run. Add other CWoW streamers and it was probably around 150k eyes looking at the new product. That being said today had a massive pvp battle in Arathi Highlands. Of the roughly 80 people per side 10 or less were streamers of any consequence. The other 150+ players were just random people.
---
Nice will do thank you always keen to watch aussie streamers
---
Do you perhaps have a video for step 4~ on how to do the cliff death trick and spawning halfway through wetlands? Thanks again!
---
Shroud is basically where most streamers stand. Remember, every new WoW expansion gets good Twitch numbers on launch. Then most people dip because truthfully watching WoW isn't the most exciting.
---
If three months in WoW viewership is tanking (Doesnt mean Classic isn't fun) they will go back to their "main game" or playing the newest launch game. That is unfortunately what they have to do. Some streamers have talked about how it's sad that they can't play the game they love most cause it loses them money.
---
(For example, someone asked Ninja if Fortnite is his favorite game. He laughed and said no. It's Final Fantasy 11.) However, when he streams Final Fantasy, he gets very low viewership compared to Fortnite.
---
People like Asmongold and etc that have made WoW their homes will stay. But people like Shroud (and there will be many like them, whether it's beta or launch) have to follow what the viewers want.
---
There's a LOOOOT. I'm debating between possibly rolling Priest or Hunter for Levitate/Disengage over my normal Rogue since options are so limited before BC engineering.
---
South of Silithus, on top of/under Orgrimar, on top of Stormwind (inside Stormwind bank behind wall to kill bankers as horde), west of Gnomergan, east Stranglethorn, GM Island (may not be possible in Vanilla without modifying game files or using fly/tp hacks and possibly getting banned), Hyjal, Azshara arena, etc. There's some good videos showing very detailed top down views of the old Kalimdor/EK which you can use to spot areas to check out.
---
I wanna play just as bad as you but it doesn’t matter either way because I just want the game to be perfect when it launches.
---
id rather not get a temp invite 
---
incant do much testing in 2 days and my sub is slowly running out if i dont get into the beta in a month im not resubbing lol
---
Entire reddit was #nochanges a few months ago, currently there's A LOT of changes. Why isn't the community questioning Blizzard?
---
I wish they would release the criteria so I can stop wondering if I’ll be lucky enough to test the game I’ve loved for almost a decade and a half.
---
its really close the way they have it, unfortunately the game is empty except for 2-3 towns
---
I bet they'll anounce more about the stress test tomorrow. I mean, we don't even know what time it starts on Wednesday yet.
---
Like Jonah Hill
---
When is the next wave/ Anyone get one recently.
---
When destiny 2 launched, i was more distracted by the lack of content to notice the social features were also missing...
---
Then hopefully the way decisions are made for classic is not the same as retail's way
---
I mean I've seen him kill Uber Elder with a melee character that was built in SSF(I know he died trying it in HC.)
---
That's not exactly *bad*
---
Oh I hope ye have fun. I want to have fun to
---
League in 2019 LOL
---
Great look at it! Hopefully Blizz sees this and figures out what's up.
---
Because I'm fucking salty that I haven't got a fucking invite and those shit-head streamers, hyping the living fuck out of the game, are just doing it to cash in on classic.  
---
My no-experience in Beta-Testing is worth more than them drawing in potential customers!  
---
Reeeeeeeeeee! #notarealbeta
---
Easier said then done :(
---
did you just call pink sparkles fat? LMFAO this subreddit is hilarious.
---
So hes not pushing for rank 14
---
Starts at ~2:40:00
---
Not happening haha thanks tho
---
No worries. He’s a good hunter. I’m glad I have him in the guild.  I don’t think he’s using a mic last I checked but he does respond to chat as he doesn’t have a huge following but he’s good.
---
Originally I'd have guessed that it was because Blizz accidentally put pets into the batching system too, but since it's the same bug as retail, not really sure what's up. Hope to it see fixed too though.
---
What? All healers can get cs'd lol
---
You don't know what you're talking about
---
Paladin has conc aura and bubble....No other healer has anything like that
---
And the number 1 prio is not getting CC locked, all other healers can be very easily CC locked
---
DOn't give advice when you know nothing about the game
---
That's exactly the same reason I subbed when they announced the beta. My friends always get mad because I am too seem to be in all the blizzard betas. From Vanilla WoW and it's expansions to the first wave of the Overwatch beta I seem to always get invited and I don't know why. I report bugs as I see them of course but I would say I'm far from the perfect tester. I play the game and report what I find but I don't play it like a QA tester. 
---
This one after the first wave went out I was a little disappointed as it was the one I really wanted. Then the next day when the next wave went out I saw I was in. I don't think it's very random and I think they really have select accounts and people they invite for whatever reason. I don't know how I got to lucky enough to be like that but it is what it is and I won't complain, though it does suck since my friends almost never get in.
---
Yarp.
---
Even Asmongold can't typically stream for longer than 8 hours anymore because it fucks his throat up, think he made an exception due to the WoW Classic hype, it was too much $$ for him to pass on.
---
well not allways, this is pretty low level combat still, at endgame being geared matters more. in vanilla the gap between an ungeared 60 and a pvp geared one was insane, you could cut through people like it was nothing. Numbers will win out at a certain point but if you have better gear and coordination its easy to win when outnumbered.
---
There are 2 kinds of people...
---
It’s like getting your dick sucked or 10 seconds and then she gets up and leaves.
---
The main one that I want to know about is Levitate since that opens up like 90% of the places like this considering we don't have BC engineering.
---
Sadly levitate is level 32...
---
Nope. I’ve played vanilla long enough to know which ones I like.
---
It's been a long ass time. It doesn't help that the older you get the more forgetful you get as well.
---
Subscription is just a recurring purchase of game time anyway
---
MODS!!!!
---
oh, well now we know
---
Staysafe has been streaming vanilla content for over 2 years now. 
---
He isn’t going anywhere.
---
Quin? Benched from his guild for ages Quin? tried to make his own guild and wiped multiple times to Garothi Quin? The only games he's good at are the ones where time = performance. That's why he plays ARPGs, low mechanical skill requirement, large time investment requirement. 
---
He's not a *bad* player, he's definitely above average, but he's *certainly* not exceptional in any way really.
---
I think you missed his entire point. You can’t.
---
Seems to be a common issue with streamers.
---
Can someone point me to the current plan/best guess on how/if progression will be handled? I.e. timeline of raid releases, and so forth.
---
I hear ya. I enjoyed druid at first, but I got kind of bored of him around 30. I enjoyed paladin up to 30, and if I would have knew about /sit reckoning, then I would have taken him to 60. In the end, my dwarf hunter was the only thing I took to 60 back in vanilla.
---
I’m from Aus and also streaming on twitch, come say hello sometime! Leshraque is my twitch name
---
and 100% reason to remember the name
---
I also saw him die at lvl 42 because he stood still in innocens's beam.
---
Feels fucking good no more undead rogue edgelords to contend with
---
DS is more of a PVE spec, but only if imp wasn't needed (rare, considering few people played locks decently in classic). Succy/FH has too much PvP utility to sac IMO.
---
I never played horde in vanilla. So to see that tauren hit box was crazy! I thought no way is that right! But I never played horde so I don’t know for sure. I just believe the people who did and tell me that’s how it was. It still baffles me.
---
No, it seems like that’s how it was in vanilla. It got nerfed badly in tbc, but all private servers are based on tbc so that’s  probably why it’s like that on ps and what people are used to. The thing is warrior is already the most popular class on ps, the one con they have is bad leveling - but with vanilla health regeneration there’s essentially 0 downsides to playing a warrior.
---
The stress test page says "While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test it doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test. We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game so that we have the right mix of players to ensure great feedback toward making WoW Classic the very best experience for the community." So they arent going to let everyone into the beta, it looks like they are just going to send out a bigger wave of invites. And I doubt they would only give temp access for the 2 stress test days. The whole point is to see if the servers can maintain that amount of players. If the first stress test goes well it would be pointless to revoke access from all the original stress test players because the next scheduled stress test will need to have more players than the first round. I think if you get an invite this week you're good until the end of beta.
---
Really doesn't mean shit to only acknowledge a personal flaw but not work on it.
---
Sounds like you are debating between 4 classes. Next, just decide if you want melee or ranged. That'll get you down to 2 :). They play completely different, so it shouldn't be too hard to decide between the two styles.
---
Hi, /u/Feral_Moose
---
Omg i hate when people fear in dungeons.
---
Swifty is 50 mate
---
Probably multiplied exp rates.
---
yeah , there will be plenty of less popular streamers more than happy to no life the shit out of it for views
---
but when you have 13k+ subs i doubt you are too worried about no life honor grinding.
---
not to mention all the streamers will have their own cuck guilds they will just take all the loot first as leaders. like asmond will prob be one of the first war's with TF and shit like that. 
---
When you have subs and first pick at all the pve gear how badly do you want to grind all day for the pvp gear
---
Int, Spirit, +Heal until you can get decent cat gear in ZG/BWL/PVP. Exception is feral was okay for BGs, especially warsong.
---
This is great! Thanks for linking it!
---
You better be ready to switch to resto spec everytime you want to raid. Ele Shaman is not good in PVE because you run out of mana so fast.
---
Looks like lipstick lmfao
---
I've never main'd a melee. Interesting change of pace, but I'm pure PvE and like being able to take in the whole fight easier. Priest main, lock alt. The opposite of vanilla for me.
---
People have to leave the cities to get literally anything done. Wpvp will be alive and well.
---
Yeah I'm really looking forward to experience how it REALLY is! Less than 100 days to go!
---
Too weird, this is like the gif guy saying it's called jif way too many years too late.
---
This is all about who registers. So if no one registers with that guild, no one will be found
---
Seduce
---
Bandage
---
Walk out to cast range
---
Immolate
---
Curse of Agony
---
Kite
---
Corruption
---
Laugh maniacally
---
Kite moar
---
if you really want them, you can disable them and use the classic raid frames.
---
Cross realm invites are the only thing that make your theory hold.  In Vanilla it was absolutely possible to form a group from a website, but no one did it because 10 million players were all mostly on different servers.
---
Oh I thought that’s what auto-loot meant, I thought they were saying there was no way to automatically loot a mob at all
---
Yea, I'd totally use full retail graphics on classic if I could. The nostalgia aspect will certainly be fun, but I'm anxious for the gameplay of classic, not the nostalgia.
---
If people want to play rs3 and empty their wallets for an ugly costume or pet, let them. They are paying for development and servers for osrs. The thing that absolutely kills me is that they are pulling in so much money between sub fees and cash shop purchases and still shut down the servers for runescape classic that still had an active player base. You can’t tell me that they didn’t have the money to keep at least 1 server open.
---
Endgame pve and soloing mobs at 60 are very different. You wont be rage starved or waiting on cds as a geared dps in raids. You will time your blood thirst and whirlwind in between auto attacks, use heroic strike when above 45 rage and if your fast enough you will be using hamstring between auto swing timers for extra flurry / wf procs. Ive played mage too and it is pretty fun, aoeing shit etc but im pretty donkeyballs on casters in pvp so i tend to choose healers/melee.
---
How do you find out you’ve been granted beta? Email?
---
I feel like streamer servers are going to have massive faction imbalance and very low populations.
---
want to share some secrets? need some help? lol
---
Holy if you plan on playing with friends, or prot for soloing against basically anything (joking a bit, also bring a book)
---
15 years thinking it was jo-anna. I don't know how to feel about this.
---
If they weren't going to revoke access, why list two dates for each stress test?
---
[First](https://i.imgur.com/JZAQJWO.jpg)  
---
[Second](https://i.imgur.com/wnmEYSE.jpg)  
---
[Third](https://i.imgur.com/s4Q57f6.jpg)
---
There's the Silvermoon Exiles, but I don't remember is they were removed for BC, or never made it past the original alpha/beta.
---
Pretty sure even if every version of how to do this that is patched on live is patched on vanilla, you will sill be able to get there as a gnome with Elixir of Giant Growth + relog on top of the bank vault. You also might be able to use Noggenfogger Elixir to make yourself smaller for it.
---
Never played a private server and made 5 pvp videos myself in vanilla, they were on youtube, never streamed.  
---
Vanilla vids were done with fraps.
---
When Classic is more Battle for Azuroth than BFA is BFA
---
Eg
---
They will need to fix lag if the pitifully small # on closed beta can make 10 second lag spikes.
---
It won't change a great deal. It gives you like 3-4 spaces to play around with, still no chance of full dot rotation for even a single warlock.   
---
Warlock needs +16 hit from gear. Have a look at gear available in phase 1, and 2 and 3. Good luck.
---
like Jonah from Veep
---
Do you get the choice on Classic Beta?
---
Regardless, it's basically vindication for him on why he's rolling PvE. He talked about it near the end of the stream. Even if he has his own "legion" his gameplay can be massively intereferenced. Way more than even the most casual player. If you or I get ganked, the person probably gets bored after a couple kills and moves on. If it's Asmongold, they adore the "stream time" and being "That annoying fuck" and will do everything they can to BM a streamer.
---
warlocks were in high demand during vanilla with more slots they will stay in high demamd
---
if you think your raid will be hitting the cap the best geared locks can just go destro as they likley will want too anyway
---
ive heard 1 shadow priest will be worth it because of the 5%? shadow damage buff  
---
i like to level affliction but i much prefer to raid destro
---
Its the left most cove on the top of the dun morogh map. If you swim there you should zone into dun morogh.
---
"There will be Stress Tests done at regular intervals, including late next week, around which time we will be inviting more players."
---
This can be interpreted both ways....
---
It wasn’t that bad yet in wrath... you usually don’t see the negative effects until the next xpac.
---
Until you get a gathering quest.
---
Unfortunately, the biggest hope for alliance is rolling a PvE server. Asmongold (Biggest WoW audience) is rolling PvE. Seems Horde is way more ready to dominate.
---
Twitch introduces a new element, a modern problem that requires a modern solution (layers)
---
Don’t be surprised that vanilla players appreciate an authentic experience that streamers ruin.
---
Narp?
---
Thanks glad you enjoyed it. Yeah its pretty major. The mobs do have a decent drop table for gold grinding. So you can get some decent gold while getting rep.
---
You and me both!
---
* Streaming Character
---
* Hidden Private Main
---
?
---
Yep you can
---
Warfronts are pretty much Wintergrasps but against NPCs instead of players.     
---
So, the battles are always the same and incredibly boring.  
---
Just grind to get materials, build siege weapons and bum rush the final boss.      
---
Since they're NPCs and not players, it's always the same battle and same tactic. Gets old really fast.     
---
They did however bring back Wintergrasps though, so you can que up for it like a normal BG. 
---
I did it a few weeks ago and it was pure nostalgia and I loved it.
---
Fury Warriors do truck loads of damage. Just truckloads when geared.
---
Was curious about this haha
---
My guess would be to simulate a soft launch. They would send out a good amount of invites over the course of that 48 hours to see if the starting zones will be able to handle it. I remember when the day Burning Crusade came out there were so many blood elves in the starting zone it was insane. But its the first stress test so im sure blizzards servers will be able to handle it. The whole point is to keep getting more and more people into the beta over the course of the scheduled stress tests to see how the servers handle everyone. And by the last stress test I would imagine there would be a ton of people in so blizzard knows they are 100% good to go for launch day, because launch day EVERYONE will be on at the same time. and this reddit is already at 100K members and there are way more people than that who will be playing. Blizzard needs to prepare for 200k+ people ingame at the same time
---
 because its been nine years in development.  ive been with swgemu since the first year the forums existed
---
Same here, installed swtor to level a character and quench the thirst but didn't work
---
Just promise me you won't hurt yourself, okay?  Retail will always be there if you start getting a painful feeling in your arse.
---
Shadow just isn’t that viable because you will go out of mana so quickly in a raid that you’ll be downing mana pots faster than you can use them. It’s why it was never anything but a real meme spec. If you’re a priest, you’re gonna heal more than anything else.
---
I used to cast rank 1 BoW on myself non stop until the dispelling stopped, then cast max rank BoW to bait them into dispelling again. Never played against anyone amazing, but beat every holy priest who tried to dispel/manaburn me to death.
---
Ikr... if it’s just nostalgia how do pservers continue to pull in the amount of people they do?
---
Is it that when polymorph breaks it restores the threat table from before the polymorph? Does the auto-attack on the sheep even register?
---
i think 1 of each non optimal class is fine
---
class leaders just need to make sure everyone else is the right spec
---
the last thing you want is most of your healers deciding they want to go dps
---
If I remembered every detail of what I did when I was 9, or 19, that would mean I haven’t had much else to remember.  Fortunately my focus on a happy life means I don’t have to remember my way through wailing caverns, because I never bothered learning it in the first place.  Even then it was utterly unimportant.
---
Oh wow madseasonshow on reddit? My favorite depressed mono tone world of warcraft youtuber. 
---
Honestly your videos are dope. I rewatch a lot of them (especially time warp and azeroth arsenal) when I have nothing to watch.
---
&gt;I currently play on a pserver, and this one (and many others) have some of the worst ganking/toxic PvP community I've ever come across in wow. Corpse camping to the point where you have to log off. Autistic lvl 60 rogues ganking you and quest hubs constantly. Whole squads of opposite faction players that just roam zones killing everything in sight while they wait for bg ques to pop. In a lot of ways it's kinda ruined the fun for me on these servers cause you literally can't play or just spend hours of your free time grabbing your corpse and switching to new zones. I'm too old for this shit.
---
You didn't level on the sort of Vanilla server I leveled on. That type of PvP behavior was the norm.  To counter it, you joined a guild with a strong crew of people who liked to gank the gankers.  It certainly caused people to learn to rely on their friends and guildies more than a PvE server would, thus creating community.  It also taught me a million tricks to escape gankers.  Invisibility potions is the key to beating corpse camping.
---
Warlock, about 30 days played. Was my first mmo. Not even sure I knew the cap for a good while. Just explored and had fun. I recall spending hours just trying to get into groups to run a specific instance. And I'd just sit outside the entrance the whole time instead of grinding. Those were the days, no rush, all relax.
---
Because they are earned at 20 on retail and BOA gear is equipped at level 1.
---
Sounds like a great time to make new friends. Also those thousands will be divided among 6 starting areas and spread out all over Azeroth.
---
**99% of streamers will quit after launch, doubt they even make it to 60.**
---
World record is 2 weeks to 60, and that's if you know your shit, steamers will take maybe 4 weeks to get to 60 or more, and that's playing 12+ hours a day, that's only to get to 60, not counting dungeons and raids which will take months to get to.
---
They aint gonna do it, it will kill their channel when the hype dies down like 2 weeks after launch.
---
I really hope that the gaming industry learns from wow and osrs. Develop your games for your fans, not a statistic. Companies these days are out of touch. And for the love of god, leave the cash shop out of your game. If you want money develop a good and complete game that will hold an audience.
---
Damn. That’s pretty accurate. I’m sad now.
---
Also, Saccing your pets with the demo talent can provide a nice buff for the lock that isn’t awful. I don’t consider an Aff/Demo lock *that* meme-ey. 
---
Not nearly as much as a balance Druid or a shadow Priest.
---
HELLO THERE
---
Can you really blame him though? He doesnt have a job and urgently need to grow his 1k viewer stream to feed himself.
---
Surprised gnomes arent teporting their smaller hitbox
---
that's just it...nostalgia is 'just' a label. "you're just nostalgic"
---
it's ME saying that YOUR enjoyment of a game is temporary and not deep
---
that doesn't at all make it TRUE
---
if YOU say you're nostalgic, that could mean something deep and strong to you
---
and pservers: players are hungry to find the fun. in whatever form that comes. many have bbeen conditioned to seek the fun from the opening server level race, then hop to a new server
---
it's never 'just' nostalgia...but nostalgia, memories, are always a parrt of it
---
8/18/05 with a 10 day guest pass sup bruh
---
If the servers were populated like live, with human dancers and musicians in Rori cantinas, I still wouldn’t grind for 2-3 months to get crapped on by a defense stacker with a mind burn weapon.
---
Bugger that was quick!
---
autoshoot with wands is doing some similar things too.  sometimes wanding with mainhand sometimes with nothing in hand
---
Oh God. My friend was taking about how he just wants to get to sixty to do the raids and dungeons and chill with people on discord "like the old days."
---
Didn't get that he did that through every retail version and it failed him and became bored. Couldn't grasp that the journey was the fun. Hates leveling. Hates grinding. Wants instant gratification. Wants minimal effort. Only log on for raid person. Didn't get why you can't have flying if there are fight paths, like your character should just be able to train their own griffin.
---
I don't see him lasting in classic.
---
Can’t wait to play some Classic with you Madseason!
---
honestly he could just go anonymous and not stream while leveling.
---
I believe this is the guy who initially showed that classic wow was possible. He was a blizzard employee who took the old game and roughly ported it to work with modern WoW server infrastructure.
---
Yep, that's why I just can't get into retail. The challenge is gone.
---
My causal raiding guild in vanilla didn't care.  Of course we didn't finish AQ40 before BC gearing killed raiding but we had a lot of fun struggling through content as a group.
---
What happened?
---
Oh my god, I forgot about wintergrasp.  So many hours spent in that as a kid (I played TBC and then wrath quite young, like some of us on this sub).  Also my brother was there almost 24/7 but not to pvp, just fishing for the turtle mount under the bridges.. I guess it gave him a little thrill knowing he could get pk'd at any time lol.
---
Yep, you're right. lol
---
Can't tell if you're memeing or serious. I mean, makes sense. But then again... They say anything can be a Hunter weapon
---
I smoke two blunts before I smoke two blunts,  and then I smoke two more.
---
I don't really care about what others play, if they want to play a sub-optimal spec, its their decision.
---
That said, It's hard to say on what basis I think certain specs are bad, some of it is past memories/"knowledge", some of it is surely all the new info we've gotten from pservers and theorycrafting.
---
--
---
I'll gladly take them into my 5man groups, wouldn't really mind having a few of them in a raid either (like 1-5) - Sure it'll slow us down a bit, but if its just a few players it won't be too much.
---
Personally I'll try to optimize my character to some extent, but still leaving some room for fun experimentation.
---
Exactly why I don’t play retail anymore. They took the feeling of pride away when you had amazing gear that you know you earned.
---
We feel you. Even though I’ve seen this post a thousand times, you put it well. Can’t wait.
---
BAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
But there are no beta keys. Why do people keep saying there are?
---
Nah, World of Roguecraft was the OG PVP video.
---
he also listed destro which was the most common build as soon as locks had a bit of gear
---
We relied on friends and guildies tons on pve servers.
---
is this thread about people who want 100% original vanilla numbers?
---
I AM THE LAW!!
---
Sad.
---
What are you talking about? The biggest server had over 10k people on today. Vanilla server caps were like 3k. Retail uses sharding to deal with the exact thing you’re talking about, it’s just not the issue.
---
Anyone who's looked through that Instagram knows what's good.
---
If it was only temp. access I would think they would specify that. They already said that the beta was only temp. and would be wiped on a certain date, so I would imagine if the stress tests were temp they would specify that too. They say " around which time we will be inviting more players." when they say "inviting more players" to the beta that sounds like beta access until the end to me.
---
You forget that blizzard are the ones who ruined WoW and have no idea what they are doing with retail :)
---
Difference between experiencing and expressing, especially to an audience.
---
No, enough with the celebrity worship already.
---
I'm avoiding beta. I don't have a sub now but I have an account from release day. I don't want to spoil it for myself until it comes out.
---
Holy fuck, that is fantastic. Esfand is legitimately hilarious.
---
Which is what I’m afraid of. I want normal vanilla caps. Mega servers just aren’t fun. People are able to act like assholes more on mega servers because the repercussions are much less.
---
Just to clarify, bgs are in phase 3. Honor kills are out in phase 2, but that’ll only be through world pvp.
---
Yup on pservers if you and another guy are killing the same mobs there is a 95% chance they will accept a party invite so you can do it together faster and both get credit
---
I mean he was a Glad and has rank 1 parses on content that was current at the time... He might not be a top .01% player in the ilk of MDI or AWC winners or whatever, but he's better than most of the clowns on Reddit that talk a big game claim to be.
---
He was benched in SotD largely because he wanted to play his main(Ret) while he was pencilled in to be playing his Rogue for AtBT.
---
I wonder how they'll release content. I see people saying classic prog will be released over 2 years, but I think they're going off nothing but the old patches.
---
Are you going to announce what faction / server you plan on pre release? I'd wouldn't mind running into my favorite monotone YouTuber in the wild.
---
It doesn't work in classic, if you jump off the cliff your ghost spawns in loch modan. I watched staysafe do it on stream
---
&gt; Mythics shouldn’t be the only difficult thing in wow.
---
Mythics aren't even that difficult. The only difficult part is beating the timer. IMHO using timers to raise the 'difficulty' of a dungeon is on the same level intellectually as just giving the mobs more health.
---
60 resto druid. Killed one boss in naxx. Mostly just trash.
---
Is there a lot though? Haven't seen that many "changes" that they confirmed fully, ie ones that people keep reporting as bugs that aren't and things they said are staying in. Aka like request stop on flightpoints which is to prevent you from having to log off then back in to do the same thing
---
There was a dev interview after the Irvine event where they (Brian Birmingham maybe?) were talking about how compared to classic, retail spells are super computationally taxing because they have way more interactions with talents/traits and procs, which is why large scale pvp can overwhelm even modern server architecture.
---
We won't have that problem in classic.  It's gonna be dope.
---
If you think people putting together private servers can make a better server structure than a multi million dollar company for their biggest money maker than idk about you.  It's obviously because of the amount of people, the multiple data centers and everything that the actual servers have to do in the background that private servers do not.  
---
If private servers were doing something so special that blizzard could do but don't know how, they would hire them to do their magic.
---
Phase 3 is BG's, 2 is honor system
---
It's not that hard to escape a camper. You die a few times, then you get away.
---
If you just res right on top of your corpse, then yeah... but don't do that.
---
I roll PvP just so that when I'm running through a lowbie zone I can gank a few lowbies for fun, then move on.
---
Idk why. I'm not that into PvP (I always play a healer or a tank), but I grew up on PvP and can't fathom any other way. There's something almost magical about running into the opposing faction and /salute or /bow or /waving to them, have them return the gesture, and then quest along side each other, sometimes even help eachother out if there's a bad pull. It feels like you're truly bridging the gulf between sides in a war.
---
I don't think they're as easy as you claim, especially post-MC/Onyxia.
---
he’s 50...
---
Bit more detail.
---
Warriors are a lot more gear dependent than rogues. They also lacked threat dumps like rogues which can matter in certain fights plus rogues had a lot of utility with poisons and CC. Warriors did great dps, but generally later in classic. Since we understand a lot more about the game now, this may be different. My memory's a bit hazy here, but well into BWL+ they did well, before that.. less common. MS in PvP was a must-have. Mages and locks were strong later, but early on generally your rogues were top dogs, maybe with the odd skilled hunter. Going OOM was a real concern for casters, particularly if you didn't stack comps to support them.
---
For healing, for 40mans you needed everyone, if not just for decursing/dispelling/poisons/etc. Pallies were in demand for auras and buffs, same for druids, priests. Shammies for totems and of course heroism. So arguing about who the best healing class for raids is, doesnt really matter as you needed everyone. Shadow priests are also viable if you gear/play correctly, but need the right group for VE to support. Was also very hard to gear them before ZG. They were misunderstood pariahs in classic, but again we have a smarter playerbase now.
---
Oh that's dope af, definitely worthy of some reddit praise
---
Is this darkspear? I feel like I know you somehow.
---
balance, and feral with an off tank set, shadow priest,  prot pally tanking with full t1, can be good as like, one spot max each in a raid for respective group wide buff and buff to shadow damage/ aoe tanking ability situationally. ret is a joke pve though. fury warriors especially one with rank 14 early on are like the best dps till aq40
---
not sure on shamans, never played horde in vanilla
---
"you think you remember, but you don't"
---
:P
---
He'll quit classic after 1 month to play the new flavour of the month BR game
---
i cant read all that but do you want to do a lot of world pvp?
---
are you ok with being ganked a decent number of times leveling?
---
then a pvp server is prob for you
---
if you dont really give a shit about world pvp id just roll pve server.
---
for vanilla i played on pve so ill prob go pvp so i can experience world pvp amd i dont mind being ganked a bunch
---
You miss the point entirely. But keep getting upset and crashing servers with a 40v40 on retail.
---
Well, and every single character has almost 10x as many procs and effects and formulas for the server to calculate through. Sometimes simpler is in fact better.
---
You do have some good points.
---
All the kids will be in school. Less competition when servers go live.
---
yeah swifty’s memory is clearly going. turning 50 will do that to you.
---
&gt; In this version, I might not be able to fight a horde ganker who is ganking my friends 
---
If they invite you to group you will.
---
BOLVAR is the true SW's leader!
---
Won't be very open at server start. If people want to respec or run goof alts later it won't be a problem. If you willingly chose something bad, I would question every other decision you are going to make while grouped with me.
---
Just to be clear the /sit Reckoning is a private server bug.  /sit still crits you in game but doesn’t allow crit reactive procs
---
Umm, first I'm not upset at all just facepalming.  
---
100v100 wouldn't crash a server at all even on vanilla, no idea where you got that.
---
So totally unrelated to op’s post?
---
i guess you were wrong ;)
---
It’s a school night. They gotta go to bed. They won’t be back on till 330ish pm. I, on the other hand, have a week and a half of paid time off.
---
i was right ;)
---
What did he say that warranted removal while calling someone a retard doesn't?
---
No doubt the emotional support you revived from you guildies about a hang nail was a real comfort to you.
---
I tried playing on the F2P all accounts have, I got to level 9 then i was just to bored to continue, I never died, never even droped under 60% health, the "challenge" was finding enough mobs to kill.
---
there was nothing of interest, at ALL.
---
I neeeedd classic need it BAD!!
---
Watch literally any retail wpvp or even the 40v40 in av, the game becomes completely unplayable. Not sure why you’re trying to join a conversation you clearly have no clue about.
---
Why would they need a dot rotation at all when shadowbolts will hit harder, more frequently
---
And this is with most VPNs IP addresses being V4 types. How long till they can give out literally trillions of IPV6 addresses?
---
same. let’s group up.
---
Fire, too bad molten core, onyxia and black wing lair are not the best places for it.
---
Madseason is my dude! Best “actual” content creator out there!
---
My gm told me that every Beta have to end... sounds like the streamer beta ends with the first stress test 🤔
---
The first part of my comment was more me just shitting on him for the crack, tbh. I'm aware he's gotten great parses/ good rating. I think my personal opinion is that I just don't think he will commit to classic. I think that he'll ride the wave and then when the hype dies down he'll just roll back into whatever he feels like rather than sticking it out for the long term.
---
It's a commitment problem that I view as his issue. Same thing with his guild, he couldn't bring himself to make that commitment and hard swap to Rogue for ABT and instead chose to drop from the roster to play what he wanted instead. It's not a bad thing, but it is *a thing*.
---
Retail Bad
---
For the top end of min/max I expect they may be willing to bring 1 shadow (31/0/20) and just put up shadow weaving/PI and then heal.
---
Affliction is a non-starter in raids due to the 16-debuff limit, which is staying AFAIK.
---
In 5mans, dots do such crap damage and the mob would be half-dead before you get your dots up..
---
Affliction wasn't really strong until BC, where it was absolutely destructive.
---
Remember that old glyph of fear, that made mobs tremble instead of run? Jesus, I absolutely LOVED that thing.
---
I wonder how many subs they got just from people hoping for a beta chance. I'm still tossing it up...
---
Watching this video is more fun than logging into retail
---
If you're bad play on a pve server.
---
I'll be honest, I didn't read all that. 
---
It's your call, but I've never rolled on a pve server on anything in my life, and I don't intend to start now.
---
Takes half the fun out of the game.
---
I too hate the usage of the world literal when it's not!!
---
Holy shit, he's actually dating a twitch thot? 😂
---
Be careful who you call ugly in middle-school?
---
None. Completely separate. Classic WoW isn't BfA.
---
actually, you can already move many frames (e.g. unit frames) by right-clicking
---
Nothing from BFA will carry over....
---
i used to get picked on for playing WoW by the runescape kids.
---
I wouldn't worry about this, as while there were tons of warriors in classic most were terrible -  they were a lot harder to tank well with. If you can stance-dance where you need to, and so forth.. you'll find a spot.
---
Why wouldn't they, they most likely have the most time to play out of all of us. Not many other people can play WoW 8 hours a day 5 days a week.
---
Love your videos!
---
Some classes will be more viable  as we will launch with 16 debuff slots, so things like SP will more viable.
---
I love you both
---
Cross realm BGs were a thing in vanilla. Even though it was later in vanilla, it's still vanilla.
---
triggered
---
Dude it was like 45+ versus 45+ in Arathi Highlands near refuge point. There were several pivotal moments where the momentum changed between horde and alliance, but Asmon and friends chose to fight near base to recruit the alliance guard's help. But after several exchanges of dominance I think the horde won in the end. I don't know the main streamers of the horde side, but alliance was Asmongold and Esfand
---
Wanding while regenning mana was expected.
---
Absolutely not. Clashing flavour profiles.
---
My friends play OSRS currently and tried to get me into it. I quit that game so fast..
---
Wand spec priest is BiS
---
Wrong, should be wanding or even meleeing if wand-less.
---
Hallowed Wands
---
Prot paladins literally cant raid
---
I tried Legion a bit.  Fell asleep 2 levels in!
---
Good vid, makes me reconsider a bit since Its a rogue too, damage might be right
---
Will PoM + Pyro be in the game????
---
Less money mate, he needs the fat stream stacks.
---
I'm cheap as fuck so Im gonna buy one right now
---
Yeah, we'll just have to see how it plays out. I think they're really trying to launch with as small a number of servers as possible as a ton of people are going to try Classic out and then quit shortly after. I'd expect most current BFA players are at least going to try Classic out. Hence the need for layering instead of a large number of servers that will eventually turn into ghost towns.
---
I'm honestly optimistic they're going to manage it correctly, they've already stated they're prepared to quickly open new servers if the needs arise and while it seemed like they didn't want to address merging servers (probably cuz it implies Classic isn't successful) I am sure they are prepared to merge if needed.
---
Always just run from priest if he's not retarded he'll just start mana burning you and never stop
---
Seal is better because like I said you don't have to target yourself. And the judge from rank 1 seal of righteousness can proc hand of edward the odd which you should be using in a situation like that. And if you time it right/get lucky he will start wasting globals trying to purge nothing.
---
Nothing will carry over to Classic and nothing obtained in Classic will carry over to BFA, to include toys, xmog, achievements, mounts, etc.
---
lol i had two close friends back in the day that tried to get me into it. i used his moms laptop while he was on the family desktop while he was carrying me through the intro dungeon or w/e it was. one of the most boring things i’ve ever done. couldn’t wait to get home to play wow.
---
Shaman were absolutely needed. They provided excellent support, whether healing or twisting. Usually they were Resto, though.
---
&gt;We subbed again the other day to have a shot at getting into the beta
---
One of you gets beta.
---
The other does not.
---
Divorce incoming.
---
Sorry, friend.
---
this is not world first. 
---
this was our guilds first.
---
no
---
Get a waifu in game, try The Lions Pride.
---
Lol I believe it!
---
Sal-T
---
Yeah isn't this article basically just a blue post from a couple of days ago with reddit comments compiled together?
---
Even looting appears to be spell batching, watch any stream of people looting a few mobs. Theres a noticeable delay, theres also a delay with mobs responsiveness towards following players. This was not the case on the demo, the demo was extremely smooth , the mobs stuck on top of the players with no delay and looting had no delay as well. Spell batching was probably just slapped onto the entirety of the server as a bandaid fix to simulate. But really it affects the responsiveness of the actions of the servers / game in a general sense. I hope they limit the spell batching to only spells instead
---
But hard is good.
---
haha. thanks
---
Kinda the same. I resubbed cuz im a dummy as well and ive been enjoying the game. That being said, im just farming legacy raids for transmog n shit but its fun whike watching netflix or w/e. Would i sub without the chance of beta or, in the future, classic access? No, but im not regretting my $15 rafgle ticket.
---
I think shroud is an exception to having to switch around games though. No matter what he plays people will watch cause he's good at everything. Plus his sponsorships and money. It would depend if he actually wants to keep playing moreso than anything but we'll see
---
well. if noone needed it.
---
My advice is, if you know you enjoy PvP, make sure you roll on a PvP server and don’t worry about DHK’s right now. Classic PVP is another thing and mind-space altogether. It fundamentally alters social and playing dynamics on a server because of how it is integrated into and affects questing and anything you try to do. 
---
Rolling on a PVE and then realizing how much fun people are having on PVP servers with all the shenanigans and what not happening there and having regrets isn’t too fun. Leveling takes a long time, having to abandon all that work to reroll sucks...That’s what happened to me back in the day. I have never regretted in all my years of WoW switching to PvP servers.
---
i really don't think anyone outside of like 2 idiots have probably done this and this comment was probably made for more supplemental anti-private-server-copejerking
---
Which is why I was so freaked out when I couldn’t buy one with blizz cash, I thought they were the exact same thing.
---
Are you only planning on playing during Phase 1?
---
I don't disagree, I honestly don't see anyone seriously committing to classic long term if they're trying to be seen as a serious player - Naxx will be cleared the first/second day it opens if pServers are anything to go off.. and then what else?  R14 grind? 
---
The game is more of a time commitment than a mechanical challenge, exactly.  So you can understand that it gets a bit tired hearing randoms coming out of the woodwork shitting on people who are more than likely way more accomplished than them.  Like does anyone seriously believe some random Redditor talking shit in r/classicwow is really a rank 1 parsing player when they have no evidence to back it up?  Anonymity is a hell of a thing.
---
I didn't mean for this comment chain to go this deep.. was just a passing observation that a guy that has streamed himself doing pretty damn good in the game is probably better than the nobody calling him "not good".
---
It's been a super long time since I've done it, but I remember doing it pretty consistently with human/horse mounts. Nelf/cat mounts were hardest, maybe because the saddle is lower to the ground, making your model lower to the ground? Not sure how it works entirely, though.
---
APES beg to differ.
---
Disagree. Some classes are a lot more gear-dependent. Others have better synergy in group play than others, vs solo. By this logic, nobody would play a holy priest in classic since it's just wanding + casting renew for \~40 levels.
---
Hi, /u/beerbrawl
---
So he's basically Kripp
---
No because I tested them all on pserver before, wich you should do as well
---
Logistically they're not, there is a lot that goes into preparing people to be able to do those encounters in terms of buffs and gear.
---
Mechanically they are very simple though. A single mythic encounter in retail has more mechanics than several classic raid bosses added together.
---
That shouldn't happen.
---
oh no, I just meant that my plans will likely shift to picking a class that's more conducive to social play/raiding rather than a pvp option.
---
Though considering that means I will likely go priest, they arent necessarily mutually exclusive.
---
I forgot how fucking fun PVP was as a mage in Vanilla
---
PYROBLAST + Automatic Crit talent = Kill machine
---
WORLD of WARcraft.  Call in back up, everyone is itching to start a war.
---
Is there any official word on WoW Classic using updated graphics?
---
That and battlenet launcher will show it
---
Be sure to check jb hifi frequently, that's where I snagged mine.
---
Oh ok thanks, when I looked it up everything said 40.
---
aight I'll be Zenobia the Undead Rogue, add me up when the time comes
---
Yeah, ganking lowbies requires a ton of skill, you sure put the people who want to actually be able to avoid griefing in their place.
---
Arcane Mage is useless. Ret Paladin is useless.
---
Hunter parses on private servers show that they're basically useless in AQ40 and Nax, Feral Druid DPS requiring a massively convoluted rotation and still not parsing close to average rogue dps, Fury Warrior and Rogue inarguably being the best DPS classes. 
---
Balance Druid, Elemental &amp; Enhancement Shaman, Shadow Priest, Arcane Mage, and Retribution Paladin being OBJECTIVELY bad in raid comps and never taken because of mana sustainability issues or having a kit that doesn't make sense. Now we're not talking BFA homogenize the classes. We just want to be able to play a fucking Balance Druid in raids and actually getting invites. 
---
On top of that its pretty well known the class designer back in Vanilla HATED the hybrid classes, so he made sure that they were universally less useful than the pures.
---
How about the right hand action bars?
---
Tips out, baby
---
I was excited about classic, and I'll still try it, unfortunately the toxicity of this subreddit has been a turn off. 
---
For the record: 
---
If you enjoy classic, cool I'm glad for you I've had games I love that were online only die/not be playable anymore and it sucks. So congrats on getting it back in some way!
---
This is classic
---
Also very similar to how rank 14 works
---
Oooooh im so edgy i hate popular people and streamers i like 4chan im a true gamer. when will your kind die out
---
Thandol Span (bridge from Wetlands to Arathi).  Leads to a quest giver.
---
How does the raid/dungeon lockout/reset work again? I haven't played WoW since, ironically, patch 1.12, so it's been too long for me to remember.
---
Watching Asmongolds stream it seemed like the alliance players greatly out numbered the horde.
---
Probably a little better, since Classic is just retail with old textures.
---
That's what we call journalism now
---
It’s relative, really. Compared to most stuff in current WoW, the enemies are considerably harder outside of end-game Mythics and raiding.
---
How is that not what vanilla wow was during AQ?
---
It's the Thandol Span between Wetlands and Arathi Highlands. Jumping over to that part leads to a hidden quest.
---
Amen
---
May i ask why?
---
Haha no worries, it's just a long rant 😅 just curious to see if people think the community on classic will have less toxic ganking or not.
---
The system was garbage, and only benefits people forced to servers because of friends.  The PvP of Warmode became heavily artificial, having to give buffs to one side to compensate.
---
I raided private server and was wanting to be a shadow priest but I quickly found out that you run out of mana and do shit for dps. You’re spot on.
---
Lol 😂
---
I think that's different for everyone regardless if you are an intro/extrovert.
---
Mad cute
---
Try going to the gnomish airport above IF
---
For sure ill check it out after work cheers
---
&gt; Also, spell batching in BFA? Hah.
---
Batching still exists, chief.  It just happens more frequently so is less noticeable.
---
Thanks, assburgers.
---
... you almost never have players of MMOs seeing the same environment. For as long as graphical options have existed, MMOs have had varying levels of clutter and detail...
---
You will run out of arrows of arrows in the early. When doing your first dungeon buy more arrows than you quiver can hold . It stops being issue later in the game
---
Lol my gf does that all the time when she plays. Constantly helps the other faction kill stuff and then when they turn around and kill her and she can't wrap her head around why 😂😂
---
There was always a dead zone where a hunter couldn't hit you with range. That was removed after classic. 
---
Unless I've miss read what your talking about it's working as intended
---
I'm not saying you'll know exactly how to play the class at max level. Never even suggested that. I said you will be able to know whether you like a class by level 10. If you're a Priest, you'll be able to know whether you enjoy casting heals and shields by level 10. If you're a Hunter, you'll be able to know whether you enjoy shooting arrows and using pets by level 10. If you're a Rogue, you'll be able to know whether you like going invisible and attacking things from behind by level 10. The classes differentiate themselves from each other pretty quickly, and a person isn't going to, like, make a Mage and suddenly be tricked at level 50 by the game saying "Hey, all those spells you were casting from a distance? JK NOT ANYMORE HERE'S A SHIELD GO BE A MELEE TANK." Mages are Mages through and through.
---
There are exceptions, such as Shadowpriest (because you literally CAN'T be a Shadowpriest until level 40) or Feral Druid (because again, it's just not possible due to level restrictions). But class flavor and overall aesthetic is noticeable from the outset, and you're not going to feel bait-and-switched by rolling a Warlock and then being told that they don't in fact use demons and hellfire at level 60 but instead cast heals in mail armor.
---
It looks Thandol Span.  The 2 bridges between Wetlands and Arathi.
---
nope, it'll be just that bad, maybe slightly less at the beginning when everyone is leveling, but once people hit 60, expect those same things to happen.
---
Here's one about Classic.
---
We're coming home.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsnR59GF51c
---
He BoP'd the mage and the mage got BoP'd. What do you expect to happen?
---
Ultimately, it comes down to one question *unless you plan on becoming a server first 60*: do you find leveling as a journey to be savored or as a task that needs to be completed?
---
If you want to savor the leveling journey, constantly improve your gear through AH visits, questing, and dungeons, then a PVP server should not take away from your experience.  You will be competitive against all people of your level, and if someone of higher level decides to be an idiot, taking an hour+ break is fine, because you are not there to speed-level anyway.  
---
On the other hand, if you just want to get leveling "over with" and view PVP as an activity that is a waste of time, just roll on a PVE server; do not listen to the PVP crowd that throws around terms like "carebear" as a way of demeaning people.  Ultimately, it is about what you value as a player of the game, and if you do not plan on investing time and resources into PVP, then just roll PVE.
---
Lmao, I played Magtheridon in vanilla.  Was rank 14 on my warrior, before BG's were even a thing we had 250v250 almost EVERY day in Hillsbrad Foothills, we had several raids into main citys from both factions with multiple raids on each side.  We had unbelievably huge battles when trying to open up the gates for AQ, sorry kid but I don't need to "watch videos" when I was a part of it all and the servers rarely crashed just from a big brawl, yes there were occasions during the first few months when they we're figuring out what kind of hardware was needed when WoW became the most popular game very fast.
---
The worst thing that happened more often than anything was just a few seconds of the server lagging and we would be right back to fighting, so how about learning a bit about the conversation you obviously have no clue about.
---
Probably not, it's the same type of people that will be playing classic as were playing private servers.
---
Forgot to mention it helps to be really insecure.
---
Balance Druid says hi, as does Survival Hunter and Arcane Mage
---
Warrior was the best at dps? That’s news to me.
---
I gotta say, I only started watching any streamers just recently, but Esfand is a truly unintelligent person. I'm not trying to put him down or anything, I'm just saying he is obviously very slow.
---
The amount of times he makes a very bad decision, or is completely oblivious to a situation, or just plain doesn't understand something is frankly staggering for someone with a public following. Why do people watch him? I don't get it.
---
And it seems like every other time Asmongold actually starts talking about something interesting for a change, Esfand invariably comes out of nowhere and interrupts As mid sentence with some completely inane information or question that NOBODY gives a single fuck about. It's infuriating.
---
I take it back. I AM trying to put the guy down. He's a fucking dolt.
---
There are people on this subreddit that actually believe private servers got it more correct than blizzard.
---
And I finally decided to continue downvoting and report every one of these. Do you seriously think we need 10 of them a day?
---
Resets at midnight pacific time monday night/tuesday morning, except for ZG, which resets midnight pacific time every 3 days. You are locked to one instance as soon as you step in and any bosses are down, so if you join a group on Ragnaros, you don't get to do any other bosses that week.
---
Does he even lift
---
Note Skinner is labeled as a jealous classic hater. No one other than those people are being ridiculed here. If you expanded the scope of the meme yourself, that's on you. Don't get it twisted.
---
No rage, I was a rogue in vanilla, had that sweet chest piece looted by a hunter instead of me. I still am salty cause it's not in retail anymore and it looks sweet.
---
This time though, it'll be my turn.
---
I charge thee to report this once per month in the beta as well.
---
Wilt thou accept this quest?
---
Idk, I think trying to sell your merch in your friends’ stream is kind of a scummy thing to do
---
I REALLY like this video. I haven't played WoW since BC, but I've watched enough of it via twitch to know that it wasn't really something I was interested in playing.
---
As he's describing everything he really likes, it reminds me EXACTLY why I fell in love with while playing this game back in high school.
---
the question isn't "why do we have a dead zone". What I'm presenting and trying to see if anyone else could find more information on it and hopefully gets looked at by blizzard, is that effectively the deadzone is 5 yards (3-8) total on the beta. I did not test it on the demo, but according to the DB from the demo build it was correctly 3 yards (5-8). So either something is wrong here on the beta, or it's always been 3-8 and everything that says 5-8 is wrong. I'm thinking the latter, and hope it gets looked at as it was reported in game.
---
Can you try the many spots to glitch under org?
---
Ppl pvp mostly as balance and survival is used too. And mages raid as arcane/frost for tge first 2 raids? Lot of mages play pom in casual pvp too even though its ass
---
Correct, those games would go for hours sometimes
---
I constantly see "Arcane Mages" as a "non-viable" spec. The spec used for raids prior to AQ is 31/0/20 Arcane/Frost spec.
---
Honestly you can use anything. In general Agi is your best stat, then stam/int, then str/spirit. Really though no stat is bad as druid though.
---
Disappointing IQ, beta is to clear such things out
---
Anyone currently in the beta: Can you disable shadow effects in system settings again? The fact I can't disable them in retail anymore hurts my fps
---
Yeah that's fair!
---
Oh yes! Love the armor
---
I still have my tinfoil hat theory that they're going to use classic as a testing bed for the layering technology and implement it as a fix to world pvp lag that sharding can't handle well.
---
Is there a link to that, or is this the best link to watch the fight?
---
true.
---
Good job :) ... I plan to play Hunter so keep your good job :) ... thanks !! 
---
... how was your experience playing Hunter overall? ... did you pvp ? ... tell me everything lol :)
---
Vanilla WoW CE pets carry over to Classic
---
It really annoys me that Blizz seems to have forgotten that in recent years.
---
meh... anything after wotlk isn't canon in my eyes
---
i don't have any good argument for that btw, that's just where i think the story became cringe and heavily influenced by pandering culture.
---
I remember it being 5 yards it was a pain in the arse for the first levels before you got a pet. There was this really annoying point where you couldn't melee or range attack.
---
Yeah so the raid will be 
---
2 Fury Tanks
---
1 Mage 
---
1 Druid
---
1 Warlock
---
3 Priests/pallys
---
rest rogues or fury warriors
---
Just play the op stuff, you shoulnt be playing Classic to HAVE FUN
---
Yeah, thats why you now should belittle people coming on to this sub and give them shit right? Since when was that mentality successful?
---
Actually private servers are surprisingly accurate compared to the era, except for the two things you mentioned :p 
---
Personally I love it, more credit to the devs who ultimately made this whole thing a reality
---
While I completely agree with your statement, and find it accurate for levels 1-100 ish.
---
I’d say after this, the story content of questions makes it, at least for me, feel more rewarding and meaningful to level. And then at 120 I find many many challenging ways to spend my time. Earning rewards I feel like I had to work hard to achieve. 
---
Which is your point here.
---
I am not talking about random heroic dungeon or battlegrounds, LFR or world quests. Welfare epics. 
---
I find great pride in accomplishments in mythic raiding, rated arena and the gear I wear because of it. 
---
The problem is the rod to get here is long and boring in retail. So on that we can agree.
---
No, classes in retail have an answer to every situation. We just want some semblance of usefulness for specs that have no reason to be as weak as they are.
---
Indeed, one must be very insecure to call someone bad based upon the type of server they wish to play on.
---
What I'm saying is: if an immunity is activated during the same spell batch as taking a hit (including fall damage) then the immunity is supposed to take priority and prevent the damage. But maybe you're right, and he accidentally bop'd the mage.
---
Anyone know of good resource sites for class builds?
---
It's not server capacity, it's the quantity of information that clients send to each other in retail.
---
https://www.quora.com/ELI5-What-is-the-N-squared-problem
---
Spells are more complex in retail and transmit a lot more data. This quickly overwhelms any server as the number of users increases.
---
This is the answer that Omar and another dev gave during an interview the day before beta.
---
&gt; Another example is the success of Oldschool Runescape. OSRS has about 3 times the players as rs3 has.
---
Just wanna chime in cos I see stuff about this posted around a lot.
---
It's true OSRS has a lot more players than RS3, but it also has *hugely* more bots. 
---
For example, in the week 6th to 12th of May, RS3 handed out approx 6,100 permanent bans, Meanwhile, OSRS handed out 137,000 permanent bans.
---
Carebears
---
This shit gives me life
---
I would but not  paying 60 bones for BFA, I'll stick with my sub though.  I have plenty of money but I won't waste it on something i'll play for a day or two ya know. Too many people said BFA sucked for me to waste
---
Still have my sub ticket tho!
---
I do that sometimes. It's almost like a goodbye. "I'm done, so I'll betray you because red = dead. But I had fun questing alongside you!
---
I still play retail but nowadays it just feels more like a chore than actually being enjoyable. The ability to get High end gear is a joke since you no longer need to raid(except Mythic) and just the feeling of accomplishment has been gone for a while. I can’t wait for August to come around so I can relive my teenage days of coming home after a long day and jump into the world and love every second of leveling.
---
Druids are the worst in numbers, until Naxx when you get the idol for HT mana return. They are still fine enough and since there won't be paladins you can easily find a spot healing as druid. It's unpopular but the buff is required for the raid group so you will usually be fine.
---
Look at the mage buffs. She wasn't BoP'd.
---
Esfand had her in target and was out of range, that's why his BoP didn't came out. He then targeted himself and cast BoP during the same tick of his impact. His BoP went on cooldown yet he still died - simply because the  fall damage happened in the same tick. With the faster spell batch update rates on retail he probably would've survived because his BoP would've been cast earlier.
---
Dartol's Rod has a part in the quest chain where you've turned in a step but retain the rod.  No quest sitting in your list forever.
---
I've played hunter pretty much majority of my WoW life. I've always had a blast with it personally. Specifically for PvP vanilla hunter is pretty strong. They are capable of taking on pretty much every class at every gear level with few exceptions such as SL lock or spriest. There's a whole lot to it though. If you want to learn more about hunter, you can join the hunter discord [here](https://discord.gg/8TVHxRr)
---
I'm sorry to drop this bomb on you but you're the bad insecure poster child with your comments in this thread. 
---
I'm going to opt out of the one part of vanilla that isn't a cake walk because I'm bad. 
---
I'm going to pretend that means it's all ganking lowbies because I'm insecure. 
---
I don't get any joy out of you being this way but maybe this is a good opportunity for a bit of self reflection.
---
Which is fine. I’m more interested in PvP. Figure raids will take me anyway. Can’t have to many totems.
---
Really? Pretty sure the druid flag running spec was 0/30/21. Doesnt look like balance to me?
---
Either way Balance Druid, Ret Paladin, Enhance and Elemental Shaman were NEVER taken to raids for a single simple reason. They fucking sucked in long fights.
---
they don’t have a working client... they have a database of values.
---
Retail= Participation trophy
---
Just play and you'll get stuff , then play dress up in transmog, then unsub a few days later!
---
its player vs player in the world, it is exactly world pvp.
---
I hope the people who just try it out wait a week or 2 so as to not get in the way of those who are dedicated. Doubt it though.
---
My server had a ton of wpvp. The 40 pally vs 40 shaman vid came from my server.
---
why?
---
They won't.  Retail has shown it's colors with classic coming live.
---
Upon self-reflection, my only regret is taking your bait...at least I hope it was bait.
---
that's why I said "xfire, OR the huge pvp videos". not "xfire, the huge pvp vids". Reading comprehension :)
---
Actually you can with Fire mage late game in Naxx. The ignite debuff from critting with fire spells is refreshed by all mages. So if you crit Pyroblast you want your whole team of mages to keep that big ignite on for as long as possible. It's pretty ridiculous actually lol.
---
Will follow become disabled in world PvP? 
---
Also, on release will all my friends need to make characters at the same time to stay on the same layer - or will we be able to invite each other and then the server will remember what layer we are on?
---
Even if he meant figuratively, he said:
---
&gt; How CAN we have that first time experience again even if we played back then?
---
How do you get anything close to "how can we have a BIT [of the first time experience] back?" from that?
---
Like I said, it's more when the ganking is non-stop. The scenarios I've faced when leveling on pvp servers ultimately is almost no combat. I'll be questing for hours then all of a sudden a 5 man group of 60s will come in, kill all the level 20s and the NPCS. Followed by corpse camping.
---
It's not really like a sense of danger for me because you just can't see it coming.  Especially when they have mounts and you are walking on foot.
---
Thanks for the new desktop wallpaper!
---
Yes, always.
---
How about that time a guild tried to hold an in game funeral service for their friend and an entire guild of the opposing faction crashed the service and ganked everyone that showed up.
---
It's the same problem, you just use petpassive to call off your pet instead of making it attack
---
It's very important in a version of the game where you have to macro your pet not to break your freezing trap
---
Can I parry beasts' or unarmed NPC's attacks? (in other words is Deflection -&gt; Riposte worth it as a lvling rogue)
---
What
---
He could have used it on the mage. Blessing of Protection (Rank 2) lasts 8 seconds, and he doesn't check her buffs until 10 seconds after he cast it. So it's possible it wore off before he looked.
---
Stormx plays 29 points balance.
---
And ofc they wont they are complete dogshit in raids. So are many other specs
---
You spelled Bubble-hearth wrong.
---
No one did it because the tools were harder to make in 2004. Now every other person seems to be a web developer. It wouldn't be hard to make a site, make you define your server and then have it matchmake for 5 mans.
---
We've come so far in tool development in the past 15 years. These things will exist and they will work.
---
This seems like the part where you're uncomfortable and opt out. Don't worry pal, change is hard and I don't hold it against you.
---
FLEXX CONNECTS!
---
BOOM HEADSHOT, AND THAT'LL DO IT!
---
Such an iconic call idd. I miss Igoaf.
---
For real though, letting the enhance shaman just mosey on in and get on top of Ven was a really big mistake by his team. That whole tournament revolved around not letting coL.Black's shaman connect if you could help it. In most games he wasn't allowed to. Van's team was sleepwalking out of the gates on this one though.
---
You're right, I'm banning myself from posting for 20mins out of penance.
---
I think it'd be pretty hard for you to remember it being 5 yds vs 3 yds of a dead zone... given it's been so long. I will agree that the fact that there is a dead zone at all is/was quite annoying where you can't do anything in that area though. I'm merely hoping to shed some light on the discrepancy. Why do abilities state 5 yds if they are actually 3 yds? If melee is actually 5 yds, why is the gap between melee and min range greater than 3 yds? Why does the demo properly have 5-8 as a dead zone from the databases, but the beta build doesn't have spellrange.db2 at all? I'm thinking something was messed up recently but I really don't know and that's what I and several other hunters want to know.
---
I mean, we know what will be released. They have announced the actual schedule.  How much time between each phase is unknown but I don't think it will be much longer than what we had originally.
---
i used to have that shirt

To this day whenever I hear “Sea Shanty” I pop a bonie

Geared Fury Warriors to be more precise
---
Twitch may be the only place worth watching streams with the alternate viewing capabilities now.
---
do we need to buy WoW or only a sub will be requiered ?
---
what is the port paladin supposed to do? Stand there and look pretty?
---
Does gathering and mining cast time get canceled on damage or do you have to do a hard cc?
---
Thats what Tips does best, ride the coat-tails of more successful people.
---
That’s a horrible solution since you end up with tank squads roaming and killing everyone. Also wtf are you supposed to do on a PvE server?
---
LOL
---
He was desperate for numbers. It's not like he wanted level 12s
---
??????
---
Eh.  Grouping is always beneficial in modern WoW and makes leveling faster, though its obviously not needed.  Grouping in vanilla can be greatly beneficial at times, but a huge hindrance in others.
---
Thanks man, I really enjoy watching your videos! Monotone voice guy FTW
---
notice the lack of lag
---
I love the grass and all, but most of the time it’s just too much for me. Like when there’s grass on the snow and it’s like dry. I think I’ll end up doing max settings, but probably 75% grass
---
Checked the link, it's not actually there, pure troll. Plus, he was also probably in his own stream as well at the time.
---
They tend to all stream with shared comms, so the cross-advertising is a pretty natural thing as you can hear them thanking their own subs / callouts and stuff while they chat.
---
I remember not being able to melee or range attack. 
---
If it was 3 yards I'd be able to melee ergo it wasnt 3 yards. 
---
A good caster could live in that dead zone and own you without your being able to touch them.
---
3 yards is 2.74 meters
---
It doesn't look anything like this tbh.
---
Chill, it's all an act. And he's going to keep on that act as long as the twitch money keeps rolling in. I don't blame him though, his viewers expect that kind of behaviour from him. And would much rather watch him over some other boring streamer like coh.
---
I concur.  The subtle humor and the production, were additional highlights.
---
&gt; I think vanilla wow is an interesting analog to American politics. 
---
stopped reading there.

Im rolling an undead warrior, soo this is perfect, im going to print this and frame it.
---
Amazing drawing btw.
---
I'm bleeding, making me the victor!

The more I watch Asmon the more I think being a sore loser is an act he puts on the bait the chat and bait donations. I've never been linked Asmon's stream because he's being wholesome, but I do get it linked to me when he's "salty" or saying stupid shit/ false information.
---
Zack is pretty smart, if you watch his personal IRL channel talks.
---
Lol. Is this a serious post or a troll?
---
Remember to add all the addons you know that are updated or wish to keep tabs on at [https://willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com)
---
Remember to support your addon authors!!  It's a labor of love! 
---
I hope to have a favorites system, as well as notifications, rolled out by next weekend. Just struggling with Bnet OAuth integration at the moment.
---
Ah no idea, I just saw that the frames are movable on some stream..for action bars you probably want to run some addons anyway
---
if you come in here asking for shit like transmog or group finder then yes i'm going belittle you because it takes away from the charm and the original experience. remember, retail was once the game this sub fawns over and when you come here to suggest things that were key to killing the original experience, i have every right to belittle you because it's borderline trolling. me suggesting the removal of such an addition to the original game that made getting epic gear like getting common trash loot and being met with bitter responses makes me think the retail players just don't like investing time in the game or the social aspects, and instead like getting handouts and super linear content.
---
Are you going to link the actual site or just the image?
---
To be fair, that is true on retail.
---
Omar is the new Chris Metzen
---
Nice. I play Horde so I don't know the specifics. Always bummed that it's Alliance only though!

Yep. I also power-level people. It's my meditative zen garden. Also, patches oftentimes change things (8.1 significantly impacted twinks) so I go to xpoff.com to talk about what the latest farmable BiS's are.
---
Thanks
---
They get a lot more money from BFA no doubt. Even if you buy one level boost or buy one pet/mount, that is more money made for them. And a good amount of people don't just stop at one level boost or one mount or pet.
---
It's right there in my comment. :)  https://willitclassic.com

Was watching Sonys vods fighting asmongold in Arathi Highlands. Enemy psychic screams keep showing up as a physical debuff. Intimidation shout from warriors is supposed to function this way, but not priest fear. Should be a magical debuff (and thus, dispellable)

Thy did for the source code, not for the database.

I hope we'll have you back for classic! I'm sort of the opposite from you, I never played vanilla so I'm psyched to see what it was all about myself first hand.

Hunter questions:
---
1. I know most classes had a legendary weapon that was pretty much meant for them. Did hunters have a weapon of that sort for them? 
---
2. Is there any reason to go Survival Spec in late game? Or even, would you be gimping yourself my leveling as Survival?
---
My favorite part of this entire video is the, in all caps, ‘KEK’ yelled after the wipe. 
---
I can’t wait.
---
I plan on streaming on an RP-PvP server and going full roleplay. I think roleplay streams will be neat and would suck if I couldn't do that.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpgloz/i_would_be_okay_with_transmog_in_classic_wow/
---
For 5 man content i dont mind
---
For bwl and mc i dont mind meme specs. Probably not pally tanks unless we can get a kill faster then there mana runs out.
---
Content past that will only be the most dedicated to make meme specs work. Even the least meme druids will have to heal sometimes.
---
Is hyjal still enterable? If someone has access to beta you go in via the mountain region in winterspring and drop onto an invisible wall, at which point you delete your hearthstone and unstuck and it'll port you through the wall.
---
You'll probably need to watch a video if you haven't done it as the mountain us slippery.
---
Dead excited if it is though, that archimonde skele in the world tree and the pit of water that goes like 3 minutes down are so nostalgic.
---
&gt;My server had a ton of wpvp. The 40 pally vs 40 shaman vid came from my server.
---
That's cute.
---
My PvP server regularly had epic 80-130 people brawls over world bosses in that lasted 1 to 2 hours before one side claimed the boss and often used a second raid group to protect the kill group.  My average day consisted of starting some PvE activity and then spending 1-2 hours spontaneously world PvPing with people. It was great fun.
---
But hey, if you want to play in your consensual sandbox of safety, that's fine.  I'm not one to judge.
---
Yeah I guess I just need to know more about how the back and fourth is going to work but I think i'll be paired up with my friends anyway.
---
Honestly though I just wouldn't be surprised if I don't even really notice it anyway. I'm sure it'll be fine

I'm making an addon that inserts twitch chat emotes into WoW chat just for this subreddit.

No need to thank me. I know this is something we all want. ^^^/s
---
You can download a working client for free on the internet, and it wouldn't be considered piracy because it's fucking Blizzard downloading it. Are you telling me they don't have a fucking vanilla client? lul.
---
They are just doing the whole legion client thing because the vanilla client can't be integrated into bnet and for security reasons.
---
Exactly what this guy says, if I could go back into WoW being the noob I was when I started it would be AMAZING.  
---
This is a great time to start for a new player, you get to see the game how it was in it's roughly-best (my opinion).
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Probably would be furious about the lack of field of view sliders.
---
find the post?
---
So the problem with posts like these is that they're not actually comparing like with like.
---
Everything before the latest expansion is *hardcore* deprecated and not supposed to be treated like the current game. You're not supposed to be wasting your time in Ragefire Chasm the way you did back when it was relevant.
---
The reason why it felt like a mobile game is that you need to be sped through and caught up through *six whole expansions* of content that very few people are actually running anymore.
---
The fundamental problem with retail is that you can't just slap expansion packs on top of an MMO like a sandwich, which is how WoW has operated since TBC.
---
I think you're still misunderstanding what I mean D:  
---
according to what I've seen and found in the DB, melee range should be 0-5 yards. If you are between 0 and 5 yards to your target, you can hit them with a melee swing. If you go to 5.1 yards, you can't.  
---
The minimum range for auto shot is 8 yards, as per the tooltip (as well as for warrior charge). This means that between 0-8 yards you cannot auto shot.  
---
So between 5.00000001 and 7.99999999 yards, you cannot do anything. Effectively 3 yards of a dead zone. However, **on the beta**, what we're seeing for non-tauren races is that it's actually closer to 3 yards. So you can't do anything between 3.0000001 and 7.999999 neither auto shot or melee. Effectively 5 yards of a dead zone.  
---
If a mage roots you and you're 6 yards away from him, it doesn't matter if its 3 or 5 yards, you won't be able to do anything. If it is/was actually 5-8 in vanilla, then you still wouldn't be able to do anything within 5-8 yards. Does that make sense?
---
5 yards is 4.57 meters
---
Why is this guy not banned from here yet? All he does is post low effort bait and copy pasting the same shit in every thread.
---
Mods?
---
Fair enough.
---
&gt; And then at 120 I find many many challenging ways to spend my time.
---
Yeah, I feel like players just don't understand what an expansion pack means, or what it does to previously relevant content. They're not comparing like with like.
---
Since we know that pservers are really off from the real vanilla I can't take this serious.
---
I dont day it's stupid, but don't waste your time on pservers.
---
There's a chance that this happened. If you watch the video closely you'll see that his last cast on her is still out of range. He then retargets on himself and casts again. It seems that retargeting and the cast is done in the same video frame. I can't see a frame where he targets himself without casting, so your explanation might be correct.
---
But even if not, it still wouldn't be a bug I'd say. Not entirely sure how spell batching worked with environmental effects such as fall damage, but I assume it was the same and the situation is valid.
---
hes saying its a 3 year bug that nobody has bothered to fix... in three years
---
The quest reward is just rep, fucking gay.
---
Just an active retail sub, so one sub covers both the current xpac and classic. You do not need to "buy" classic nor have the latest xpac. You only need to pay the sub and it will be available.
---
he was literally so fucking salty during the epic pvp battle today. Literally one of the most epic wow moments in 10 years and he was literally just whining and crying the whole entire time
---
this is easily the best content to come out of the bets so far
---
&gt; like in 40 people if you have 6 or so people playing non optimal meta b7ilds it should be fine if they are good players.
---
That's a good way to end up with a lot of drama and /gquit-ers. When your healers are OOMing at 5%, or you can't beat the enrage timer on Vael the other 34 people are going to start getting salty about the dps that are below the tank.
---
The first streamer i enjoyed to watch. He is good.
---
I believe it was available until at least BC release, as I recall dueling with BC talents inside ironforge, in the month or so we had those before BC dropped.
---
I feel it hits me as a player who enjoys retail even though im excited for classic.
---
My guild wants to go to a PVE server when classic launches and I do not know why.  PVP was actually fun in Vanilla whereas now it feels horrible.
---
Then you owe me owe me owe
---
The garrison stuff was too much for me, but it started before WoD
---
yeah sonii's stream has been really fun to watch so far
---
Weird. Your comment wasn't showing up at first. Maybe I was too fast...
---
Sorry about that.
---
It should be if you're 3 yards or less you can hit them with melee
---
Anything above that and you cant hit them with melee
---
That's how it worked in classic
---
A lot of people remember wrong, not just streamers.
---
fucking pog
---
you obviously take the right number of healers a few good players playing nonboptimal builds is fine 
---
its not like they do absolute 0 dps
---
Then why do you claim there is no useless spec
---
pog
---
In general I hate PVP but at least in Vanilla it was fun because once you were decked out in raids you shit on everyone.
---
You are da fast man!! 😀
---
Here's a vanilla example of this, where he hits the ground at the same time as he Ice Blocks, but is still protected from damage:
---
[https://youtu.be/g8Nr3RpUE0w?t=221](https://youtu.be/g8Nr3RpUE0w?t=221)
---
Right. I remember being like in the 8th grade or something and getting very upset over the 30 minute timer (iir) meaning I couldn't slaughter teams of randoms for literally hours in the 10-19 bracket of wsg anymore. I maintained a single max level character during BC through WOTLK when I also brought a Death Knight to 80, but I mostly enjoyed thinking at 19 in WSG and levelling many alts.
---
I think I'm really looking forward to actually playing classic though. I hope I can enjoy a max level PVP character for a few months a least. We'll see if I can get back into twinking depending on how the bgs are handled.
---
Yes people need to agree with you instead of saying what they think, but you wouldn't want to shut them up or anything right?

Actually super impressive. Sodapoppin might be the only big streamer thats actually good.
---
Considering you unironically use the team "Sealioning" I can tell you aren't too bright yourself.
---
This conversation enrages the Twillight Marauder.
---
I seriously doubt he will get the numbers he wants to stream the rank 14 grind during phase two. I really really hope so but do not think so
---
Except for the fact that those private servers don’t replicate Blizzards code exactly how it was in vanilla...

hell yeh!

The ding and grats in general chat made me smile
---
BIG TRUE 
---
The RPG Elements &amp; Social Interaction made this game great and now in Beta it all comes back

Hey!

My addon wasnt updated for classic it was written specifically for classic during the beta.

It enables LFR/LFG Random Raiding !

I think PVP servers got a lot of attention because a lot of the top guilds were on PVP servers. For example, 9 of the first 10 guilds to clear Naxx were on PVP servers. I seem to recall PVP servers being larger but I dunno, maybe that's just how I remember it.
---
I did, when it came out :) One of my all time favorite games. You are correct, I misremembered it. I only had a vague notion of her being an elf. Forgot high elves were even a thing.
---
Well that works too :)
---
Every MMO I've been played has varying degrees of graphical options. More/less grass is one of the most common ones too...
---
Pixels are graphic and thus client side.
---
Procs however have to be handled serverside.
---
But there isn't any reason even bfa shouldn't be able to handle it.
---
Eve online can handle over 400 people in large scale battles before their tidi-system kicks in (which is gradual, full effect around 1000 iirc).
---
It's just a simple case of blizzard going another route. If they wanted to, it could be done.
---
Nice
---
yeah thats me every hour i look and go back to watch esfand or asmon
---
He gained the lions share of his followers (including myself at the time) before he revealed himself to be a liar. I've stopped following and watching all of his content but I don't know if there are lots of people out there who can notice some of his disceptions as he doesn't make lots of bold-faced ones.
---
I don’t even pay a subscription and don’t even want the beta, so I don’t care. Having the release is good enough. If the only goal of having a beta access for Asmongold is getting more viewers, and not test, then I maintain he should not have access. And I don’t care if I’m downvoted to Oblivion by the fanboys
---
Is this legit or a troll addon?
---
If legit, how does it work compared to vQueue and Call to Arms?
---
Hijacking this thread, can someone with beta access confirm if [this addon](https://github.com/wardz/ClassicCastbars) works or not?
---
Truth...
---
Let's hope they are fishing for those who left WoW or are about to do so ... such people generate them 0$ ... so monthly subscription is still better than 0$ :) ... hope ... hope ... hope ...

10+ levels shows skull
---
wooo thanks man, got a nice UI yet?
---
And you know this for a fact how? I've pointed out several things that show it was implied to be 5 yards. If you have proof It is 3 yards then sure, but just going off of memory is unreliable. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying evidence points to it being 0 to 5 yards, not 0 to 3 yards. Even BFA right now is 0 to 5 yards. I don't remember them ever going "Hey, we noticed that all of our range calculations that stated 5 yards were actually incorrect, so we fixed that" in a patch note. And yes, I looked through the patch notes for any reference to range and did not find anything.
---
4 periods at the end of a sentence in a text message = highest form of aggression known to mankind.
---
Melee attack range is increased during movement would be the loosest definition. 
---
There are a lot of excellent videos detailing in on YouTube as well as forum posts.
---
Doesn't matter, as long as it's full of arrows. Damage scales with weight.
---
It is kinda the point of playing druid.
---
Elwynn Forest, then Darkshore
---
Uh
---
IIRC attacking a moving target compared to a static one extended your melee range slightly to help compensate for latency. At least that's what I'm guessing he means by leeway range.
---
The alliance of vanilla weren't united under a single ruler.  Each race had their own leader, and led their people autonomously.  The same could probably be said of the undead, they were moreso allied to the Horde rather than a part of it.  
---
For each Alliance race's rulers.
---
Night Elves were jointly ruled by Tyrande and Fandral Staghelm.  Malfurion would rule the druids in place of Fandral, but Malfurion was lost to the Emerald Nightmare.  
---
Dwarves were ruled by Magni, but the clans weren't united.  Wildhammer dwarves were friendly to but not part of the Alliance, and Dark Iron Dwarves were hostile.
---
Gnomes were ruled by High Tinker Mekkatorque and were exiled to Iron Forge.
---
Anduin Wyrnn was the acting Human king due to Varian being MIA.  Bolvar and Onyxia as Katrina Prestor served as his chief advisors.  However, Anduin and Katrina were not pvp-enabled thus Bolvar was often seen as the Alliance leader for gameplay mechanics.
---
It’s like jungle love
---
I like the idea of both factions on a server having a streamer and fan base. It would be way less destructive for the community if there was a streamer community on both sides of a server. I could even see rivalries forming and that being interesting. That said, I feel like people are underestimating how many people would roll on the opposite faction of a streamer purely to gank then.
---
FOOLS!
---
Not a hijack at all. I will add this to the list. Hopefully, someone can comment on if it works.

My parents were the same with piano. I had to learn it before learning guitar/trombone. Looking back I’m actually really grateful they did, because it solidified music theory for me early on.

Someone needs to backwards Questhelper. Some of us are intensely lazy and like the assist!
---
You are completely missing their point over and over again.
---
They're talking about retail wow as it is now. Which have servera crashing or lagging to hell as soon as a big battle happen.
---
Hell, blizzard gms even forcefully kicked out 80 people that organized a city raid because it would cause too much lag.
---
1. There are only 2 legendary weapons in classic. A 2h mace and the infamous 1h thunderfury. Neither are for hunters. Really any gun or bow are meant for hunters.
---
2.  Survival has the Lightning Reflexes talent which increases agility by 15% when fully invested. Honestly, as a whole, survival is pretty bad; but, when spliced with other talents it can be a strong hybrid pick.
---
How many people are actually on the whole server?
---
Aww hell yeah!
---
There are thousand of streamers with million of community members how you want to avoid that?
---
Imagine spending time strictly to gank players half your level, legit embarrassing.
---
Monkeynews got in and hes from the UK and has only an EU acc.
---
1. Hunter has probably the clearest weapon progression of any class at 60. MC Bow, BWL X-Bow, AQ40 X-Bow. Anything else is just filler. If you're asking if there's any literal orange ranged weapons than no there isn't.  
---
2. You're gimping yourself by levelling as anything but full BM spec. But you're still a hunter so it probably doesn't really matter that much, you'll still level fine. You can spec surv with very good gear for agi stacking but most people say it isn't really that good because really one of the best things hunter's bring to a raid is true shot aura for the melee group so a hunter without that is kinda annoying.
---
Amen to that!!!
---
I know Zygor and Dugi are planning to come out.
---
I for one want to take it slow and not have that much hand-holding, so QH would be perfect!!
---
We just need someone to take up the code and run with it!
---
That's not lag though. That is just poor framerate.
---
Any damage.
---
Right, 2 things in the shop I somehow still missed that it was part of that art. The rest of my point is still valid though
---
ahh yeah, then no I did not test anything of that sort. It's hard enough to judge distance just eyeballing it. That's why I got someone to check on a stationary target. It's purely guess work on my end frankly, It's not like there is an actual distance check in BFA... Unless there is?
---
Definitely doesn't have the physics of blowing grass or moving as you move through it it's just static and I remember turning it all the way down because it was so painful to look at.
---
Man.  Nostalgia is hitting me hard tonight.  
---
Something else I didn't think of with my mage....portals will have a purpose again
---
I love the foliage too. The problem is that it doesn't fit some areas. Some zones shouldn't really look overgrown. Especially towns are too overgrown with foliage. I hope they can fix this.
---
Because nearly every class did have something dumb and powerful in PvP in vanilla. That's why it was so fun
---
THERE WILL BE AMPLE REWARD. 
---
2s
---
same every hour i check bnet
---
No. 
---
1. Most classes didn't have a legendary weapon meant for them.
---
2. I believe the theorycraft says on Ally side (kings) with absolute end game agility you do more dps with the 3% agility bonus from surv.
---
You don't have to imagine, classic will be here soon pal!
---
Yes, I hope someone makes a compilation of multiple POV and put it on YouTube, not just from this particular event but more of the PvP happenings. Would be cool!
---
Roll hacks
---
What sort of answer do you hope to get here?
---
I mean at his level of ‘fame’ couldn’t he very easily get a beta invite? Or is that not how it works
---
can this be used to buy game time on EU servers?
---
I had an Enh shaman tank all of Sunken Temple (except the final boss) successfully. 
---
Took us 3 or 4 hours though.
---
That’s how it works, but I would really hope people would distance themselves from this total piece of shit.
---
Sub only.
---
Is it possible to travel as wisp from darn to sw? So from graveyard to graveyard for +50% speed?
---
For 5 man content I'm pretty open to anything. My main will be a dwarf priest healer and I used to be God damn good at it so that covers a fair amount of bases in 5 man content. Still was on Nostalrius even
---
Now for raids this gets tricky. Certain specs such as ele shaman, boomkin and prot Pally really dont have a place in raiding unless you out gear the content. Even then you dont want more than say 1 and still probably none of the prot Pally. The entire everything for it from spec to itemization just doesnt work in Classic outside of 5 mans and farming. It actually excels at farming. That's really about it. 
---
As for other meme specs, I was in a solid raiding guild back in Vanilla. We had 1 shadow priest, 1 feral OT and eventually just 1 ret Pally. All 3 players were exceptional and were part of our core raid group. They also came to every raid on time fully flasked with all the consumables they needed. They knew their rotation, toolkit and encounters inside and out.  They were CORE. 
---
Here's the problem though. The amount of literal work they had to put in to play that spec to the point it squeaked was FAR greater than that put in by anyone else outside of maybe MT and even then I dont think he put in as much effort as they did. We actually tried running with more than a few meme specs but, like many guilds back in Vanilla, we hit the inevitable wall in BWL by the name of Vael the Guild Killer. It got to the point where we started losing core members because we couldnt progress. Eventually we offered the people who weren't putting in the work and effort on their meme specs a choice. Though there were a few hurt feelings we just couldnt carry people putting out trash numbers any more. That's not being selfish, that's reality. Those handful who thought their class fantasy supercedes the hard work and effort of the grand majority were the ones being selfish. Once we did that we were able to get over that hurdle and we eventually got to C'Thun before TBC launched.
---
TLDR even some meme specs have a place in raiding. If you are willing to put in the time and effort to make it work the majority of raiding guilds out there will take you. Just know that what you have to do in order to make it work requires FAR more effort than the "established" raiding specs and raid spots, at least in guilds that can progress in a reasonable amount of time, will be limited
---
God tier trolling
---
Sold out? Currently unavailable
---
If streamers help inspire server activity such as raids and player events I'm all for it.
---
Yes you parry. You can't disarm beasts though.
---
Why not? Caves are awesome grinding spots, have mining nodes and chests! My go to places between quests.😀👍
---
instead of exiting ironforge and taking the long run east towards wetlands you can go west and run up the hills/mountains east of gnomeregan, once you are far enough up said hills the zone changes to "wetlands". proceed to jump down, die, and you can rezz at the graveyard near menethil
---
Check out Project Ascension if you want to play a customised and open version of wow. Or play retail. 
---
Classic is not a chance to go back and change/fix the things wrong with vanilla, it is simply a return and rerun of the past.  Classes were imbalanced, specs were unviable. That’s just how it was, and how it will be
---
Appears as though they don't do invites on weekends. Will be interesting to see if there's a wave tomorrow like last week or if we have to wait for wednesday stress test. I doubt anyone knows right now though.
---
this guy is the biggest jerk Ive seen in a while
---
God damnit now I'm re-thinking everything
---
I remember once I was slow with Ice Block only getting it at the very last split second, and the combat log showed a damage tick of 0 (as opposed to immune). That was TBC, though.
---
But I do remember having to jump off heights several times to train the exactly correct timing for blink to avoid fall damage. If you were a fraction of a second too late there, you'd get hit with the damage and the casting of blink would be cancelled.
---
I was watching this live with my newborn baby at my side last night, it's safe to say I woke him up laughing my fucking ass off at Asmon missing the jump, my wife immediately gave me the most damning look I've ever seen.
---
I hope he passes this meme on. This is gold.
---
There's always going to be changes remaking a game in a new client. You have to draw the line somewhere what's worth changing or how it makes the game better to change. Things like auto looting and SCT healing seems like a chance 98% people can agree on so what's the point in investing hours of dev time trying to fix it when there's literally hundreds of actual bugs to fix.
---
I don't think questhelper existed during vanilla.
---
But someone did make an addon called Questie for vanilla p servers. I bet that'll be the one we use.
---
If you can't handle someone else's opinion about a fucking VIDEO GAME then I suggest you spend some time in a therapist's office before you shoot your boss/teacher/unemployment case worker.
---
Which changes have you seen?
---
I heard Soda say that it is not up to him whether he rolls horde or not but a friend of his.
---
Vael the Guild Killer is really the first major test for a guild. You could say Rag but I always found Vael to be harder by a fair margin. That's when you will know for sure if it's viable to carry deadweight if you have any
---
I'm going off the beaten path. With Classic hype, I have been experimenting with a Paladin build, that uses a shield but still does good damage. Gonna be playing that. :P
---
Strength is better than agi if your aim is cat form kill speed.
---
They are great in PvP and can heal raids as ele
---
AQ was an outlier as it was a huge rush for any one person to get something extremely rare. It was not unplayable but it was extremely laggy and crashed the first few hours that patch released but that was because damn near every person in the game we're going to one zone at the same time.  Was literally the whole server there.
---
I can't say much about the current servers right this second as I've been unsubbed for a few months but it has been a long time since I've had a server crash.
---
Atiesh
---
Over the entire course of the battle, it went back and forth with each group gathering more players to be in the majority. (And I believe the faction in the majority won each skirmish except for the initial ambush)
---
It started with Tipsout leading a group to attack Asmon doing the Cyclonian quest. (I think Tipsout was actually scouting the warrior island waiting for someone to start the quest, he was there when Asmon started the quest, and then he showed up in Arathi when Asmon got there).
---
I believe the battle went something like this:
---
The initial ambush was successful, killing most of The Alliance but too close to the graveyard. Alliance ressed, and killed the remaining Horde. (I believe it was something like 15 alliance against 10 horde here)
---
Horde withdrew, gathered more people, and attacked again, pushing The Alliance back to Refuge Pointe.
---
At this point, Horde was almost a full raid, and alliance was still trying to do the Cyclonian quest with around 25 or so if I recall correctly
---
Alliance gathered more players, and pushed the horde back to Thoradin's Wall
---
(By this time Alliance had set up 2 raids, but the 2nd raid was sparse. probably 50-60 in total against around 40 horde.)
---
Alliance held the wall for some time since the horde ended up split. 
---
Based on this clip, horde rallied again and pushed The Alliance back, but at this time I was no longer watching, so I don't know the numbers. 
---
Does anyone know if Asmon managed to finish his quest?
---
Story of my life. I can't even bring myself to play anything else, I just end up turning it off 10 minutes later and sit there refreshing my launcher all day....SEND HALPPPP
---
yes there are both pve and pvp servers for beta.
---
Is this what happens when you run out of arrows?
---
It's a faction war. It's up to the opposing faction to muster up players to counter the degenarate lowbie campers. Ask guild, ask world, but if no one comes to help you, it's your faction's fault, not the lowbie-ganker's.
---
He bopped the mage, nothing to see here
---
What did he do? I never really followed him, didn't dig his content.
---
You can kind of make it work but having to chain chug mana pots and demonic runes makes it a VERY expensive and/or time consuming spec to raid with for not great dps. Chain chug is literally drinking another pot the literal moment it's off cooldown
---
I tested it and it sucked. 
---
I found a Thunderbolt 3 Graphics Dock on Amazon which has an integrated NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 for 350 USD. 
---
I am not sure it will worth it though, it only has 2 GB DDR. I know it will be an improvement but I am thinking maybe I should go all the way and buy an eGPU.
---
I needed way too long to get it. Saw the picture and was like „strange sword what is this!?“
---
OK.
---
God dammit Venruki. I was almost decided on what I'm going to play, but mage is back on the table again! :D
---
while true, i'm pretty sure he's stacked enough to warrant a week of incognito leveling.
---
Yea it's viable but you don't use demonic sacrifice in PvP. Master summoner is really good because you can react to the class you are fighting, for example felhunter for casters or succ for melee.
---
Even back in retail vanilla, Joana got to 60 in under 5 days played. Definitely doesn’t take two weeks. People poopsocked on private servers and got close to breaking 4 days played to 60.
---
But leveling is like the biggest part of the game imho, so much awesome moments/interactions happen in the leveling phase; he's raking in 100k viewers during the beta while yes he can afford to do it, is it worth the $1000s of potential dollars lost just to play stress free in private?
---
thats a little extreme
---
Best WSG I ever played was in Vanilla. The Alliance ran the FC right down the middle with a 4 mage escort sheeting every Horde who came close. It was a painful yet brilliant 0-3 strategic loss.
---
Oh nice. The red shirt guy is also in the documentary.
---
Never seen this. Have to watch when I get home from work.
---
Can we please get a streamer server list? I really don't wnat to run into 400 people following one of them killing bears.
---
?????????? I mean it's a game, literally go have a faction war with a player YOUR level or get outgeared by that player, don't go have a faction war with someone half or more than half your level. Just scrap fair vs fair. It's like going out and beating up a 5 year old kid while you're a 25 year old man. Just go scrap fairly.
---
i can feel the "i have no friends and I get my moral standards from reddit" stench coming from you.
---
I'm glad these people goto nto the beta...
---
I mean Asmon is clearly more popular than Esfand... He already advertises Esfand enough by exposing him to a 50-60k viewer audience, but Esfand also has to push his merch? Also, I highly doubt you can hear them repping subs in each other’s stream because they use push to talk
---
If you can have a replicate server where you can modify values, and you have a database of all of the accurate data from Blizzard themselves, it would be a lot easier to replicate a perfect clone.
---
Those people have no idea how game development works.
---
Private servers were reverse engineered from the client side files and packets (what's on the disc you install). That's stuff like textures, text and dialogue etc.
---
Stuff like values, and logic is all server side (the code). This has never been public for obvious reasons so private servers had to do this part themselves...which is what ManGos and Trinity are. This is why private servers arent fully accurate because the people making them had nothing to go off of but research, memory and YouTube videos.
---
It baffles me when these people genuinely argue for accuracy of private servers compared to Classic. Blizzard is literally using the original vanilla code in the 7.3.5 engine/client. Anything server side is accurate. People that argue against this are ignorant.
---
You repeatedly losing your shit over a video game is kind of extreme.
---
That has literally never happened to me. But it happens to you 49 out of 50 times? Hmmm
---
? Not every spec has to be only good in every aspect of the game
---
ahhh fuck you, jon tron is great
---
You get cool titles and gear though
---
Thanks for the response! Two more questions if you don't mind - why were gnomes exiled and where was Varian?
---
i mean your wording makes me thing you're not the swellest fella either, relating video game opinions to shooting up your workplace
---
How do you get on top of the bank vault, though?
---
"We had a chat with Ion Hazzikostas and Calia Shie at Warcraft Summit and they both explained how changes to the overall concept and the addition of new content were out of the question since once altered that would make a Classic server something else entirely, and we agree. After all, fans want that old-school experience." https://www.gamereactor.eu/articles/763353/World+of+Warcraft+Classic+Our+View+from+the+Summit/
---
There is likely many pools they're pulling from. For example streamers are just ads, but some did play vanilla so can be useful in both ways. Next criteria are people who played vanilla and had higher pvp ranks. Other pool is vanilla players who did more pve content. Maybe they keep track of downed bosses etc back then. Other pools would be people who do a lot of exploring and trying to climb hills etc. Or do a ton of questing. 
---
Basically most players will fit into a pool and blizz will either pick a few from each pool for each wave or just pick from a couple pools to test specific things they want to focus on.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0
---
I think they added it in 1.9.0 so it seems that part of vanilla didn't have this.
---
It's harder. Harder things are more rewarding. Plus it is more unpredictable, which is more exciting. Plus it opens the opportunity to escape or kill someone trying to gank you, which is an even more rewarding experience.
---
Hey I’m not saying you have a bad point or anything but in regards to your last sentence it really does boil down to the fact that they are literally getting paid to play carefully curated and colourful flashy reward structures for hours and hours each day. God forbid they play a game they don’t enjoy and get paid for it. In saying that, I have no problem with streamers. Im just jealous that I don’t have the personality where I can sit at home and play games all day for an audience that actually mostly likes me.
---
In the same light you could say TWO lvl 60's ganging up on a SINGLE lvl 60 is "unfair" and "like beating up a 5 year old."
---
Ganking lowbies and ganking same-levels with more numbers are BOTH unfair situations, but it's a PvP-oriented MMORPG so you need to get some help to fight back, get good, or get over it.
---
Bro the accuracy on the writing to the write... Props for caring
---
Go away. I really hope your addon gets banned and/or disabled.
---
Thats why I actually don‘t deserve a beta invite. Ofc I wanna play it and I did back in the day but I forgot so much of it. I wouldn‘t be much of a help for bug reports. Ofc I can see big bugs but small stuff like wrong music no way.
---
Impossible
---
Holy crap 😱
---
Pally has a number of great specs for PvP, shockadin anyone, that cover much of their trees. For PvE, on the other hand, prot requires more work than the other 2 tanks for 5 mans and it's not remotely viable for raiding due to deficiencies in their tanking tree combined with itemization that doesnt support it. Prot is a great farming spec though. As for Ret, it can work in raiding as long as you put in ALOT of effort BUT it's definitely not great by any means and bad Rets are dime a dozen so you have to go out of your way to prove otherwise
---
The story after WC3:TFT isn’t even canon. 
---
Hell we even got WC3 remastered to confirm it.

Hating somebody because of their political leaning, I think you are the piece of shit here.
---
looks like
---
is the extra int really that good?
---
Yes, I do understand BFA more now, and I have played it a little this past week...
---
I still enjoy classic more thn BFA though.  Understanding didn't make it better for me, and while it is of course personal preference, I still don't enjoy the core gameplay systems in BFA.  It feels for me that the rpg keeps one entertained for longer than the loot collector.  But good luck to all, and ejoy collecting the 30!! new mounts being introduced in 8.2.  Some people do enjoy that, I'm sure.  I however do not.
---
Wut. More like 25% more. Still a large gap, but nowhere near double. 
---
Also, my favorite part is the melee with titans flasks. Your poor healers on frost tombs.
---
Especially with a trillion fuckers starting at 1 during the stress test lmaoo
---
Even though you cannot disarm NPCs w/o weapons you can still use riposte - and its a very strong ability to level with.
---
They should add in more optinal updated graphics like this, so long as they keep the vanilla settings as well.
---
If you haven't, I'm curious about on top of the goldshire inn and goldshire forge. I'm pretty sure they would have top of iron forge as well in.
---
I'm okay with that if that's what we end up with.
---
I actually only used boss mods in Vanilla, so you may be right. But I want it now because I know it existed when I DID start using addons in TBC.
---
Whoops, forgot healer. Beastmode in both PvP and PvE. Usually on tank healing due to being the best single target healers
---
How have they forgotten? The faction leaders in BFA aren’t doing what ever Anduin says. Tyrande and Greymane refused to listen to him and tried to force Sylv out of Dark Shore. It just so happened Greymane can be two places at once. Helping the night elves while killing the most interesting NPC in BFA.
---
Only one way to find out, Mark
---
Your right. The only time I leveled a paladin was on a private server which I made a note of above.
---
No one outside of twitter pc spergs thinks this.
---
There's a difference between political leaning and "Rich blacks commit more crimes than poor whites". I don't think that Jon actually believes that stuff anymore, at least I hope not.
---
I only care for MoveAnything to place the player and target frame. And OneBag.
---
Just scale him down. So we get a 3 foot tall Manduin with a squeaky voice. Worked for Bethesda.
---
Blizzard has said they don't want an LFG/LFR addon, but I honestly have no idea how they'll stop it. Disabling the few API calls needed to make one would cripple just about every addon.
---
Being racist is a political leaning now?

Are there any classic wow streamers who are playing shaman? If so, who?
---
To say it's "obviously" intentional is nonsense. There's no functional reason to put that mechanic in the game, if it is for some reason intentional that's definitely not obvious.
---
It's slower. Exalted by 60 might be possible, but 40 would be difficult.
---
You a PC snowflake?
---
Hahaha, okay.
---
Fuck you just made some memories happen. Ever go into the massive uncharted walljump territory northwest of dun morogh? I spent a few days there in early bc. Scared to leave cos I knew I'd never get back. That was when I was a kid but I know there's a goldmine of untextured goodies up there.
---
[Yes they do.](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=534) They have a working reference client and server in which they get login and play the game exactly as it was back in 2006.
---
Please stop talking out of your ass.
---
Some people are saying the mob difficulty on the beta is correct, but from what ive seen is that they are way undertuned. People are just disregarding it as "we were all shit back then and didnt know what to do".
---
From what ive understood Blizzard is taking 1.12 as the base patch. So its possible that Blizzard is "wrong", because its possible that they adjusted mob difficulty for 1.12 (or even prior to that). That patch was the gateway patch to TBC and a reason why they couldve made it easier but really any of the later patches couldve been the one to lower difficulty, so people which were still leveling or creating a new character could catch up that late into the progressed game. 
---
The majority of the wow playerbase wasnt leveling or progressing through content at that point anymore. The difficulty we remember might come from a prior patch we progressed and leveled in. So the difficulty of private servers might actually be more accurate for the authenticity of the vanilla wow experience.
---
I feel like the only people typing "Arcane Mage" as a sub-optimal spec mean "spam Arcane Missile all day every day" when they say arcane, without realizing that nobody does that.
---
Just before everyone got separated into different shards, sad
---
Also, I went to most of those areas as a shaman (early bc alliance) so all I had was farsight totem and good wall jumping skills. Also a FUCKTON of patience to find the right paths with nice hooks on em
---
Haha, we've gone to "go play retail' to "go play a private server'. good stuff
---
Two 60s ganking a single 60 is unfair, a scummy move. It's not about the low leveller "getting good" - It's the fact that, whether or not you're one of these people actively hunting low levellers and ganking them, the ganker is typically an absolute scrub that always loses in a fair 1v1 to an opponent equal level. It's ALWAYS the case. You'll never find a good player actively hunting low levellers. 
---
When I play, and when I will play in the future, I'll legitimately go out slaying every player my level wherever I go if it's a fair 1v1 scenario, if I see a 1v1 happening and even if my factioned partner is losing, I'll ignore it and walk past. Let people scrap and fall fairly, props to whoever wins and hopefully the loser "gets good" as you said.  
---
That's how I look at it. I'm a minority apparently, because people get off on thinking they're good by winning with an unfair advantages. Maybe you're that kind of guy, unlucky if so.
---
Good job, find everything :)
---
Not the areas that required lev tho of course
---
He does not want to play beta, he wants to play the game when its released.
---
You can unlock and reposition unit frames in the normal Classic client.
---
Yep.
---
That would be dumb from resources and effort use perspective. Why would they put content they don't benefit from testing? Game state is now for sure obsolete and it was tested already.
---
For sure, this was a feature people were excited about a few years ago, I think in Legion.
---
MN, Greatwizard, etc are super good! I hope people don't interpret this is me hating on private server PvP'ers!
---
https://youtu.be/JEBbeLSgm1c

big yikes

I've got an alienware with a 1070 card in it.  It doesn't get very warm at all.  I also have a ROG that had an 860 and that sucker could fry an egg.  4 years of hard use and it's still just fine though.
---
You should be able to send these to blizzard for a super beta application with preferential treatment.
---
I realize that, but when a class is labeled *Hybrid* but is actually the raid heal bot its not an actual hybrid class. On top of that the only reason Balance Druid, and the DPS shaman arent taken to raids is because they cant sustain their mana through a longer fight. There is no actual, good, logical reason to not fix something that was broken way back. When the head class designed deigned to nerf the hybrid classes raiding power because he just simply did not like them. I'm almost positive people liked raids in TBC more anyway. Because the classes had some semblance of fuckin balance to them.

That's how it is for arms warriors. I think you need to get 5% hit in order not to miss. Arms is more of a leveling and PvP spec. Fury is the raiding spec. Can do insane dps with great gear. You will frequently wear leather due to needing a considerable amount of hit just to not be a miss machine while raiding
---
Well if you look at the crime statistics in the US, it's true. Not sure about the rich or poor part, but blacks do commit more crimes than blacks. So if you don't want to go by facts, I guess you just go by emotions right?

Are there any rly popular EU streamers? Asmongold level popular. I want to avoid these servers

First off, awesome effort man! Having done similar things in the past but for only the class I've played, the effort put into this is beyond amazing. So, thank you for that.

However..... I given that you listed items from UBRS, I think you might have just missed an item for the dps casters

I disagree that BGs require nolifing. You can get great exalted reputation rewards EVENTUALLY. Yes faster if you no life but eventually for everyone.

Your not alone with the jealousy its making me mad and sad feelsbadman but only 3 more months im just so happy that its actually happening

Can you answer how the addon work? I see no screenshots and I'm not well versed in addon code and cannot test it myself.

"low IQ" is an extremely "low IQ" insult.
---
Your friends still pick up xp even if you are a much higher level, it’s just heavily reduced. 
---
They should pick up all quests for the instance, as you can help them roll through it fast and easily, meaning they’ll complete all the quests fast and get xp from all the mobs you kill....and get some good gear drops which will help them quest for the next 5-10 levels.

What exactly does stress test mean?  Will they send out more beta invites to people who will only be able to play during the stress test and once done they will lose access?

I understand what a stress test is, but I am unsure if everyone will have access during it or only selected players.
---
Dude relax. Chance is being ironic 99% of the time with his toxic attitude, that's why he's so funny to watch. Watch him a bit and you'll notice it too.
---
"1v1 me bro" is not a thing in WoW, you are in the minority and are probably from a First Person Shooter community mainly.
---
My current Private Server European Rogue class leader is the highest DPS in that raid team and is ALSO a degenarate lowbie and alliance quest giver camper with over 4,000 dishonorable kills. You may not like that playstyle but Classic WoW is a sandbox MMORPG and you gotta deal with people like that instead of crying about it.
---
To use a 2004 quote: "LESS QQ MORE PEW PEW"
---
Nothing wrong with retail or people who enjoy it. Anybody hating on classic is fucking retarded, though.
---
Grouping in modern wow is all but dead.
---
Yeah but AV won't be available until phase 3, you should be lvl 60 much sooner than that !
---
Well there goes our chance of a big Soda vs. Asmon PVP community realm with tons of organized WPVP events.
---
Asmon said if he doesnt enjoy a PVP realm on Beta he will roll on a PVE Server once Classic launches.
---
I think it's just frustrating that nobody can accept that Classic has a fair shot at success, the goalposts are always moved even when you have a bunch of signature son petitions, millions of people on private servers, this subreddit, etc. There's just no way to convince these people.
---
Meanwhile, you can see the reactions of streamers playing the beta. They're having fun! Remember when they were doing the BFA beta? They didn't have a lot of good things to say. It's almost as if there's been a real difference of game design over the years and the developers have been so busy trying to keep up with market trends that they lost sight of the bigger picture. (Which is annoying, because they themselves are trend setters!)
---
I really hope that Blizzard and come away from Classic having been reminded of a thing or two. That what really matters in an MMO isn't so much being the hero of all worlds and having people lick your butthole because you're so great, flashy cut-scenes, and infinite power climbs that make progression feel pointless. What makes the game work is social cohesion, many avenues of direct and clear improvement towards goals that take investment to achieve, a world that will actually kill you if you go mentally AFK. That kind of thing.
---
It's frustrating because people should look at Classic and ask "why was it so successful"? Instead, we get "oh, rose tinted goggles" no matter what the argument is.
---
From what I saw, he called it a loss and went back to Ironforge. Unless  he's done the quest off stream already, he probably still doesnt have the ww axe.
---
Idk about super impressive. Pretty basic druid stuff.  But out of the really Big streamers no doubt hes better. Not hard being better than people like Esfand or TipsOut tho.
---
Im hoping both Monkeynews and Stormx really grown their streams - easily the best at their respective classes.
---
Nah I had arrows actually.
---
I agree i wouldnt follow that peice of shit id stay way clear unless its too late then my heart gies out to your family
---
I would hope nothing is added or changed till at least 2-3 maybe even 4 yrs after phase 6!
---
So your advocating warrior self healing and aoe too then?
---
Some streamers though think they know better than others just because they have an audience. Not to name anybody but if you frequent the wow section of twitch a bit you probably recognize that behaviour.
---
Kupkin no!
---
He is definitely dumb but more importantly he doesn’t listen when people talk he just zones out.. dude has serious ADD
---
Classic was out of the question as well at some point.  
---
Personally I hope they add new content after naxx with the same classic theme and without making old content irrelevant, take the OSRS approach. Would be so cool exploring completely new content for the first time, while staying true to the core theme of classic/vanilla
---
You're typing like I'm new, I can guarantee I have more experience than you and your Private Server European Rogue class leader.
---
What a joke. I'm not crying about anything, just saying at how horrendous those players are, and as is your Private Server European Rogue class leader, I guarantee is a bot.
---
There's something Celestalon shared during WoD Beta that I made sure to save that should give some clarity.  I believe that this holds true since day 1 of WoW, but it's up to each person if they want to believe this:
---
&gt;     07/29/2014 09:25 AMPosted by Necronom
---
&gt;     Is there a formula or "rules of thumb" for determining a targets hitbox size and geometry?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Shape is always circular. Creature hitbox varies, of course. Player hitboxes are consistent though the exact size rarely matters (I believe it's 0.5yd radius).
---
&gt; What actually matters is combat reach. That's always 1.5yd for players, and larger for larger creatures. The distance away that you can attack a creature is...
---
&gt; Melee attack: MAX(5, SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + 4/3) + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(8/3)
---
Ranged attack: SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + AttackRange + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(2)
---
AoE: TargetCombatReach + AttackRadius + IfSourceIsRunning(2)
---
Later, during Legion Beta, he said:
---
&gt; Dreadstalkers run at 9 yds/sec (base player movement speed is 7). Their leap travels at 7.5x speed.
---
You should be able to check your purchase history on your blizzard account
---
yikes
---
 RemindMe! 105 days "You will be proven wrong : there will be at least a hundred lvl 60 players after 7 days of Classic release"
---
This was always my favorite

I actually think DS/Ruin is great spec for PvE and still good for PvP. But yeah you basically just keep the pet out in PvP.
---

---
No one has the right to belittle anyone for whatever reason.
---
If the people you accuse did indeed belittle you as much as you say and you chose to retaliate in exactly the same fashion, then I feel sorry for you.
---
Gnomeregan was attacked by Mekkatorque's advisor using an army of troggs.  Mekkatorque released chemical weapons throughout the city in order to kill them, but it didn't work.  Most of the gnomes were killed off by the troggs or the chemical gas, and the survivors fled to Iron Forge.  The boss of the Gnomeregan dungeon is the same person who started to the Trogg attack.  
---
Stormwind was destroyed in the events of Warcraft 2, and the city refused to pay the laborers who rebuilt the city.  This led to the creation of the Defias Brotherhood, and this criminal group abducted Varian at some point.  Post-vanilla we learn that Katrina Prestor had a part to play in both the abduction and the refusal of pay.  There was a questline about the missing king in vanilla, but it ended abruptly and was never continued.
---
That's completely unrelated. He said that rich blacks commit more crimes than poor whites, not in general.
---
It's going to be rough out there against people even in T1 before the introduction of PvP gear. Once T2 is out it's basically twinking at 60. Rogue is your best bet or Pally if you're running Alliance
---
What's that pink circle above your quest log?
---
Fun (not really) fact: He first revealed this during an AGDQ event where he was invited to a panel of speedrunners and was posed this question. Maybe 2016 or 2017.
---
Saw that one too, IRL is an addiction one too, but done really well

Couple weeks I would think a couple months

---
Lag is latency related
---
Which I would also love, TBC was my favorite expansion.   
---
Happy with either choice really
---
I was watching Esfand stream and Esfand said he had to bail to go watch GoT. So it appeared he didn''t unless he come back after GoT.
---
I don't have the statistics myself, but do you have anything to prove the contrary? If not, your assertion is just as baseless as his, if that's the case.
---
To add on to this. The horde are a band of persecuted freaks who banded together out of survival. The alliance, while civilized, are the ones persecuting these subhuman abominations. Blizzard has forgotten this. And assumed the alliance are just the good guys.
---
modern wow has much faster spell batching and a ton of calculations that goes into each class now. The faster spell batching means that the game is sending and receiving information to/from the server way more often. All of the procs have to be calculated fast as well to allow smooth game feel in normal gameplay scenarios.
---
Each frost dk has to calculate whether it gets a free howling blast/frost strike on every obliterate. Stuff like this stresses the server when it's being played out at 2-4 times the max number of players that are supposed to be in an area.
---
You had me at DBM
---
Darnassus rep is always possible pre-cloth. They have a lot of quests clumped together and you can do the un'goro soil weed growing repeatable turn-ins. Just make sure you do the quests at the right level. In vanilla you get much less rep for gray quests. And be aware that they've decided not to give us the unarmoured epic mounts if that's what you're going for.
---
Lmfao
---
How does the Priest feel? Thinking of rolling this come launch.
---
As someone who hasn't played since early Legion, I'm finding BFA a decently fun distraction for now, but I don't know if it can keep me engaged for the next 3 months.
---
I only say lag once during various streams of this battle.
---
Makes you wonder if the Cross Realm sharding tech used in retail is a root cause of the lag in populated bfa zones
---
You didnt photoshop the release date out?
---
Honestly there are haters on literally both sides. Its fucking dumb tbh, both sides think their right and are eargerly waiting to say i told you so like a bunch of fucking kids.
---
I will be enjoying both games and hoping for both games to have more success in the future. Both games have shit i like about them and if you are the type of person to prefer one game over the other that doesnt mean you need to wish and hope for the opposing game to burn and everyone who plays it to be miserable.
---
Go play retail casual
---
Do you have any idea wich of these combos is stronger? Dwarf hunter or human mage
---
&gt; It's not really like a sense of danger for me because you just can't see it coming.
---
Well of course the event itself is a surprise, but on PVP servers, action happens frequently enough that you're always on your toes expecting something to kill you. Will it be a level 30? A level 60? A group of gankers? That one asshole rogue named "Ikillyoulol"? You won't know. But the danger is still there.
---
Timely ice block and great job of the healer.
---
No, I thought about it but I wanted it there so I can drool about that date everyday I see it
---
Hey man, whatever works.
---
I hope pfui gets to work, really love that addon
---
They are on NA - East coast servers
---
Sounds  to me like someone's mad that they can't meme.
---
Can we still duel in ironforge? Ie: go behind the right pillar at the entrance of the bank, you could /duel there and then fight in front of the bank.
---
I am similar in my stream watching.I have seen these same things. No idea what people see in him. Could just be the whole living meme thing.
---
Asmond actually talks about worth while stuff, has massive following and his opinions I side with a lot. Just not sure why he wants McConnell in his steams. Hes just a downer.
---
How is any of this toxic?
---
I'm having a rough time deciding between Horde or Alliance priest. Visually I don't care what race I am, but I do want to help join groups that are hurting for more healers.
---
Do Horde need healers more than Alliance? Should I just flip a coin?
---
Healers knowing about down-ranking spells now (which most didnt in the early weeks/months of vanilla). Warriors know to properly make use of defensive abilities, shields etc. Some people back then tried to tank with 2-handers for lack of better knowledge.
---
Experience does make a difference.
---
im lesteneng
---
The problem being with all that and sure you can do that in retail (social aspects) but it has to be reciprocated.... Which it just don't, since it is just a participation trophy single player RNG deal now. Even if you wanted to do it, best you could hope for is guild chat..
---
Hey, could you try if you can duel behind the pillar which is in front of ironforge bank? And also if you can get polymorphed into old ironforge? thanks.
---
Oh yeah?! Well my dad works for Blizzard and he said you're wrong
---
#NoChanges #NoAddons REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE /s
---
If you throw out an invite to someone doing the same quest as you they'll accept more often than not.  Questing is always fairly easy so its far from needed, but its always benefits and does speed up the questing/leveling process significantly.  
---
Vanilla wow on the other hand went both ways.  Fighting your way through a tower or keep with fast respawning mobs to kill the leader was doable solo but a pain.  Grouping was hugely beneficial here.  On the other hand, there were many quests with split-drops with far too few mobs available.  These were an absolute nightmare for grouping and slowed the process considerably.
---
Damn dude, idk if you're looking this up or have it memorized but I'd kill to have a friend who cares about WoW lore as much as you.
---
if there was a class that hardcountered most classes then everyone would play it
---
Think of it as the MMO version of Dark Souls. It can be crushing at times, and it can piss you off, but that just makes winning all that more satisfying. It feels special to win at something that challenges you emotionally.
---
Yeah I highly doubt that. Babies like you don't last long on Vanilla Wow. I've had a million ragers like you come and go through my guilds over the years.
---
I am stuck between Lock and Shammy. Played Rogue 04 and on and them some warrior and others after.I did create a lock later and then a shammy, but not early in wow.  
---
Started Warrior or Mage then I change now stuck Lock/Shammy lol
---
if my boy madseason doesnt get in were gonna miss out on some chill content
---
If warrior and rogue would be the two most played classes i'd pick a class that counters them. You know what i mean sir
---
Will these actually happen naturally in the game?
---
Will there be a full character wipe after the beta?
---
Oh yeah of course, thats probably their thought process. I'm just saying if they had a choice they would definitely just rather everyone play BFA.
---
Back in vanilla i was possible the worste player in the game so i fully understand what he means caves used to scare me every entry would lead to 3-5 deaths... scarey place
---
I did the same thing. Never played wow before but was looking to try classic. Decided to give retail a try so I that could get at least be a little familiar with the game. I've been having a blast for about 2 weeks now. Having way more fun than I ever expected. I would definitely suggest trying it out for at least a month. It also only costs 15$ to basically try the whole game for a month, so that's very worth it to me. (You dont need the azeroth expansion for a while)
---
I'm sure Blizzard can replicate it's own code pretty well considering they have the database for vanilla. Something that pservers didn't have access to.
---
I’m kinda hoping it doesn’t. I would prefer a class not have to be built around a gimmick item. 
---
Then again, I don’t know how it was in vanilla, so who knows.
---
Horde had absterge which is one of the greatest shaman to play wow pvp. Venruki who is a godlike mage and a few others all of which competed at blizzcon at some point or another.
---
I have a feeling that warlocks will be very popular this time around. I can't decide between lock/mage, mage most appealing because of blink and kitability tbh
---
More players will be invited.  Normally those players can keep playing beta to its conclusion after the stress tests.
---
And too early would blink you midair and then you start falling again haha
---
Honestly, it’s not really world of warcraft on a pve server.
---
If you want the full experience, go pvp
---
There are loads of polls on this sub asking that... here are a few polls which we found in 8 seconds with a 2 word search on this sub alone

---
You sir are a true hero ❤️
---
Oh man is it august 27th already? Lets goooo 🤓
---
This is the best thing ever !
---
Okay thank you! I wonder if they are more likely to invite NA players over EU due to this..
---
Flip a coin.  Or choose where you want to level through.  I particularly like the human leveling zones.  Gotta love some Hogger.  I'd pick for where you want to level if the rest doesn't matter.
---
Funny enough, last week I found a screenshot of my priest in SM back in Vanilla.
---
I'm asking the tank to put a goddam shield because he's taking so much damage.
---
The guy refuse, says he doesn't like shields, nobody will tell him what to do and he'd rather be kicked of the group instead of equipping a shield ... please don't be that guy  ;-) Yeah i know it's probably fine for RFC.
---
I don't post the screenshot since the dialog is in French you probably wouldn't understand.
---
But between his grammar (or lack there of) and the diplomatic shaman that tries to round corners between us ("I'll help you heal if you're OOM"), it's a great memory :-)
---
you can have vanilla shadows if you want
---
Holy crap that was amazing!
---
Oh yeah, great point with no explanation or proof, tumblr must be nice these times of the year
---
The Chinese are not insanely rich. They had an ok economic boom and they went from a dirt broke country making $140 a month to a pretty broke country making a little bit more.
---
People in China are still poor af. Assuming this dude somehow put away half his paycheck (he didn’t) for 3 years into an above average performing Chinese mutual fund. He’d still not have enough to pay the down payment on a house in America.
---
https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5137
---
One google search to prove racists wrong, here's the highlights:
---
"Persons in poor households at or below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) (39.8 per 1,000) had more than double the rate of violent victimization as persons in high-income households"
---
"The overall pattern of poor persons having the highest rates of violent victimization was consistent for both whites and blacks."
---
100v100? More like 50vs50. Still great content, and decent server testing right there as well
---
Stormx stream was nice and chill compared to all these loud ass streamers on the top of the page.
---
I think faction rivalry in WPvP will be a lot more fierce on servers with streamers because they will antagonise the rest of the server. I won't go out of my way to kill random adventuring players, but I will go out of my way to kill the guild member of a streamer.
---
Nothing will feel quite a rewarding as forming a massive group to find and kill the douchebag streamer who's goons harassed you all the way to 60.
---
And then they target Vanilla WoW which has the weirdest Private server community, interessting. The biggest and most "faithful" to their server is the WotLK Community, servers now are nearly 10 years old and many people are the same there. Its crazy, kinda funny how people on Retail complain about same content for 2 months without patch while Wrath people play the same thing for years :D
---
I have a feeling that when blizzard sees how many are playing classic and switching over they might just overhaul the entire game to be like how classic is. 
---
With all the top streamers moving over they will be without any advertising and all the fans of those streamers will follow.
---
Looks like a John Snow after he fall to Night King
---
So it's more about having a social compact that's implicit
---
Video gaming is a hobby. Some people take their hobbies very seriously.
---
Like one relevant poll though. The 200 votes/class ones won't reflect reality at all
---
Rogues yes. Warriors to an extent. Mages maybe to start but maybe not that much endgame. No pet, no mage table, reagents for portals. My first toon in vanilla was a mage enchanter tailor. I’m still paying off loans for mats.
---
I don’t think WoW: classic will be as over populated/ saturated as classic WoW was. But I wonder if it will be super skewed with 3 king classes. 
---
If you want to go niche play shaman paladin, limited by design. 
---
Out of everything I remember all hunter druids warriors and rogues in PVP. Warlocks too. 
---
Really rare? Go something super niche like ret paladin, shadow priest. There are also some king dead end classes that weren’t fully realized at the time like boomkin.
---
You can also put 20 in each spec and become super passive jack of all nothings, which actually did kind of work in a mages locks and warriors.
---
The last part got me. "Just like it was in vanilla" 
---
Haha
---
Not possible. You'll rez at the graveyard closest to where you died.
---
Sadly it was nerfed so much that it's useless in patch 1.12 :(
---
Esfand also did that on day one xD
---
I've been playing since Nov 26th, 2004. There is a lot you can do that goes against "accepted" ideas. Skill matters more in vanilla. I'll be pulling off some great shit on my 8 level 60 warriors quest.
---
From Esfand's PoV

---
No one's happy about it, 100 days is a long-ass time.
---
I'd never ask for transmog or group finder or flying mounts but I am curious on your opinion of post naxx content.
---
One of my favorite quest chains in any MMO ever. Tirion Fordring's quest chain in the Eastern Plaguelands
---
No idea how your take away is that I'm a "rager". Crazy to me, I'll hit 60 a lot faster than you I can guarantee it. I did this content on level, years and years ago. Add me on bnet, let's see how quick you level and do content.
---
Sounds like hell if you are the leader of a 40man pug though. Everyone wanting the leader to invite their under-geared friends, nephews, brothers and who ever.
---
Yes Hunters have Rhokdelar epic (not legend) bow that requires a tedious solo demon hunting quest completion and defeating MC and Onyxia lair.  I'm not sure which patch it's introduced.  Good hunting.
---
For the record... I would be okay with transmog. Doesn't affect gameplay and can let you RP more if you want.
---
Well I play these type because the people not always the game itself. Plus social means competition :)
---
All polls linked show the same results (within reason). Warrior, Mage, Lock, Rogue on top. Hunter lowest dedicated DPS and Hybrids at the bottom (But shammy and paladin most popular if combined normally).. and i only posted 4... there are loads more.  
---
And if you search "Most popular classes"  
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search/?q=most%20popular%20classes&amp;restrict\_sr=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search/?q=most%20popular%20classes&amp;restrict_sr=1)   
---
There is thousands of questions discussin everything you asked.
---
Yes 90% are US. My Blitz Guy also Said, there is no big Intention to invite EU at this Moment.
---
Bagnon addon when xD.
---
Shroud is playing Shaman and plans to on full launch as well.
---
Do you think asking this subreddit will? Lol there’s no answer to this question man.  Play what you want to play.  Warriors, rogues, mages, warlocks they will all be popular.   No class beats them all consistently    Also it depends on if you are talking about duels, world pvp, or bgs(which aren’t even in the game until phase 3).    You probably best off choosing mage or lock.
---
Follow was always possible on PVP servers, so that shouldn't change.  
---
When you and your friends invite eachother in a group of guild, you'll be put on the same layer automatically.
---
Not sure about tips, but esfand looks like really into theorycrafting especially about pallys.
---
And he is really energetic and fun to watch.
---
Caves are terrifying lol, mobs right behind every corner waiting to gang up on your defenseless ass
---
but they are operating from a 1.12 client perspective, which did.
---
Paladins get absolutely shit on by mages. I was always so glad as a mage I had to face paladins instead of shaman
---
Is there a post somewhere that lays this out?
---
There is no instancing in vanilla so regardless of progress you can always hang in any zone together.  You just have to be on the same server.
---
So much this. Where you level is relevant to how much fun you'll have in general imo.
---
I wish they would introduce a EU located server when stress test goes live. That would be better for both NA an EU players.
---
Go upgrade tho, the game is so much more playable when it runs smoothly and loads up fast. Prices of decent laptop or PC's are extremly low atm.
---
Ret Auro + Thorns keeps his aggro for ~10 sec then he loses it but the frost nova makes the mob turn to people in melee range and back to Asmon, which is when he lands the first Sunder.
---
Hard to tell but seems like normal behavior.
---
True, an arena fight will only happen on streamer servers.
---
My point is if you look at the beta clip, you can see that the distance between minimum auto range, and max melee range is actually larger than expected. If as you say, melee is indeed 5 yards, and the minimum is indeed 8 yards for auto shot, then the distance needed to be in melee range from minimum auto shot range should be LESS than halfway, correct? since 4 would be halfway, 5 would be closer to the min range than it would to the target. 
---
However, if you take a look at my perfectly drawn Paint skills :P, you can see that it appears melee is past the halfway point. The target does not move, so you can use the terrain and see markers on the terrain to know the distance as reference points. The same is/was true for pservers that I have seen, yet every melee attack SHOULD have 5 yard range. 
---
So the point of the post is to point out SOMETHING is wrong, as the distance between MAX melee range and MIN auto range should be LESS than halfway to the target. Would you agree? Did that make sense?
---
Well I not Join the Stress Test. It dont make Sense to Just Play 1 day. So I will skip and wait
---
FeelsWeirdMan :point_right: /r/gatekeeping :door:
---
Mages obliterate shaman too so what does it matter?
---
Anyone know what the least popular classes in vanilla would be? I don't want to roll a warrior/rogue when every third person is too.
---
Some of the new people in this sub have some seriously thin skin
---
I don't think asmongold is going to play on a pvp server.
---
I smell Propaganda
---
No, I'm rolling a rogue which I've leveled ad nauseum, and a balance/resto druid. I'm too stubborn for regret.
---
I didn’t play vanilla and I haven’t found it hard to get into this. I am really excited to experience vanilla as it was.
---
Alright thanks.
---
Yeah he knows a lot but cant put it to action from what i see. And he is a fun dude.  Does trigger me with his shitty up-keep of buffs and use of mana though.
---
Hope they fix this even on nostalrius it drove me mad! Thank you for making this post.
---
Maybe I was the worst mage ever (I wasn't) but between earthshock, grounding totem, and purging frost barrier shaman was one of the classes I could basically never beat in duels
---
Honest question, not being a dick, how do mages easily beat shamans?
---
What about Karazhan dungeon?
---
You would have to own the full teir 2 set. Maybe have it toon locked?
---
Subbed for beta, been working on becoming an AH mogul and transmog lord to pay for my classic sub time, gotta say when you are only interested in loot from dungeons that pose no challenge it can be fun as gambling
---
omfg this pic :D
---
That is part of the charm of wow. You don’t look good until you earn a full set. Seeing the mismatched leveling gear is part of vanilla.
---
Hunters don't have a pet before lvl 10, rogues do6nt have dw or poisons, druids will be spamming wrath like discount mages. You need to get up to 20 at least to get a good feel for most classes.
---
They interrupt each other because (as far as I know - they had this setup on beta launch) they're on push to talk since they're both streaming. So they dont know the other is talking when they're just talking to stream.
---
forgot the link but they blizzard had it posted a while back
---
id rather they go to tbc and wrath than new content.
---
When they have the data, it doesnt mean its 110% applied to the current build since they had to do major restructuring of it. Errors can be made, its up to the beta players to point out them (so they can check it against their 1.12 build).
---
So they're making it easier. Big yikes
---
I think it's pretty disingenuous to think that the Horde just "happened" upon Asmon doing his quest when there's screenshots of them sitting in his chat while the battle was going on.
---
You also missed the bigger problem with sharding, they could have been phasing in and out while they were trying to fight at Thoradin's Wall.
---
Idk what you mean by layer? onion layers? 
---
When it releases you and your friends will pick a server, either PVP or PVE afaik, then you'll pick the same faction and you're good to go. there's no instancing/zoning if thats what you mean.
---
This isn't classic. It didn't lag *at all*
---
"1v1 me bro" and "add me on Bnet I'll beat to 60" and "these people are bots" and "I guarantee I have more experience than you" are ALL statements that confirm you are, indeed, a giant rager.
---
Those kinds of statements lead me to believe you weren't even born when Vanilla WoW came out and the first game you played was from the CoD franchise.
---
LOOK
---
Was I a rogue during Vanilla. 
---
Did I have Full Bloodfang
---
Did I get bored
---
Did I wonder into Redridge
---
There is no way to prove any of it!
---
^I ^did ^it
---
Ah, hadnt seen that message. Shame, its so complete set (while i do use Luna, since pfui doesnt have pet bars for raids).
---
Dont forget Ebn ❤
---
Another question -  I have a 5 year old i3 CPU and no graphics card. If I add an RX570 (roughly equivalent to a GTX 1060), can I expect to play Classic on medium-high settings?
---
Why is the 'a' silent? Lmao can we just decide how words are pronounced as we like? Lovlalek is spelled "Lo-lek" btw.
---
PS: Love him and used his guide when I started playing in BC.
---
I started playing in wrath post-walljump. I did however go to that area both with engineering (rocket boots + parachute off the top of ironforge) and levitation from the south coming from under SW.
---
No problems! My pleasure..
---
About the turban... I wish! 
---
Sadly it's not added until the very end (almost) of Classic. Was added in 1.10.
---
Why did he even roll warrior if he knows he's gonna be the main target? 
---
If only the Alliance had a class with incredibly survivability under fire...
---
To be fair, I’ve spent nearly 40 hours playing the beta since the 15th and holy shit.
---
At least until people get gear at 60, if the skill/knowledge gulf isn’t too overbearing between those who know and the millions who don’t, classic will not have a problem of servers dying. It is amazing.
---
I don't think it does... Or are you a "hater"?
---
If they just wanted to pve, why did they go on the pvp server
---
&gt; Asmon said if he doesnt enjoy a PVP realm on Beta he will roll on a PVE Server once Classic launches.
---
How many viewers will it cost him to play on a PVE server?
---
BIG ASS BACKPACK SWOPE
---
as long as power creep remains so minute that new raids don't cause players to skip previous tiers then awesome, if it renders something else as dead content then i don't like it
---
Unfortunately if it doesn't work the way it does in private servers then druid is firmly trapped as restoration and can never step up as a tank, much less dps. Gimmick or not, MCP serves a purpose and nerfing it will be a huge blow to druids as a whole. I expect if it works the same the view and expectation of druids will be greatly shifted in Classic
---
Yes im sorry you had to work for this but this addon will kill one of the major aspects of wow classic.. please stop this..
---
Transmog absolutely does affect gameplay and has no place in classic
---
I would honestly be happy if transmog disappeared from every mmo. To me it's incrediblely immersion breaking, cheapens the appeal of the really cool armor and weapons, damages the social hierarchy present in the game, and of course would cause huge problems in pvp
---
Kuinameplates, Quartz?
---
Thanks. I just bought two. Putting my money where my mouth is...
---
Most people aren't. I get the sense that there is only a very tiny group of people that are, and even among that group I wouldn't be surprised if most are just shitposting.
---
One of my favorite memories was our guild glitched under into the cathedrals basement. We snuck 3 warlocks under there (There was a spot under Stormwind Cathedral where you could jump into the tombs), summoned the rest of the warlocks then the rest of the guild. We then poured out of the cathedrals. we didn't achieve anything, we just ended up taking Deeprun for a while but it's one of my fondest memories.
---
Something like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TFSPQ6nYfQ
---
Whoever takes on Questhelper; Please for the love of god, DO NOT have the little line showing you the perfect route between quest waypoints on the map. Please, icons only. Make people use their brains.
---
The same way mage shits on everything else, by doing absolutely stupid amounts of burst consistently. Nova bolt cone of cold is the majority of someone's life. Grenade or cs and you get it for free. 
---
I would imagine it's closer in low gear levels but as gear gets better it becomes very one sided for the mage.
---
These very much were a thing on high pop PVP servers around endgame hotspots such as blackrock mountain, but eventually all the raid leaders told people to stop PVPing and get going on the first mob in the raid instance...
---
It wasn't built around it but if you ever wanted to top DPS as feral, it was a must. And it helped in bear with threat as well but it was by no means mandatory, we're talking like Naxx progression here.
---
Literally?
---
He meant 2 weeks in real time. You dont actually play 5 days back to back.. 2 weeks with like 8-10 hours a day
---
I'm planning on leveling a healer (HPal) for raids and dungeons but I honestly can't remember how respecing works. Is leveling as Holy viable if I want to quest as well as heal dungeons? Should I level as Prot and just offheal and switch later?
---
How does respecing work? I just remember it being expensive.
---
You frost nova them. Run 25 yards away and sheep them. Have second sheep queued up if first ones gets grounded.   
---
Now run 36 yards away from them and start frostbolting them. If they somehow reach you without dying you have frost nova/blink to get to 36 yards and do it again.
---
They can, and they will.  
---
There are quite some mail items with intellect that can drop from bosses ea, they will be usable for paladins.

---
Phase 3.
---
Joana was saying the other day on stream that people have tried.
---
Apparently it's not worth.
---
hunter always :)
---
Could you give some feedback on priest gameplay? Thinking of rolling priest myself but none of the bigger streamers play priest.
---
Bugs? Thinks that seemed “weird” from your experience? Thanks!

Wherever he is right now, whatever he's doing, Ohhgee just experienced the hugest boner of his life.  He won't know why until he gets home and sees this perfectly-executed mage initiation.
---
Classic will be big for only 2 months, after that the "hardcore vanilla" players will scare away/avoid every newcomer from retail. Next WoW Exp will vore Classic.
---
Really?? Well ignore my comment lol. I figured if it was going by 1.12 Loot tables it should be in then. Thanks for the clearing that up.
---
Perplexity just started streaming this week too, he's not even partnered yet, worth checking out.
---
Yeah I think it has to do with the height of your player in the mount.
---
It's a joke man ease up ffs
---
I really like the feel of it right now i have fun healing dungeons while speced shadow I'm mid dps and still heal its fun. But honestly leveling is just wanding the pvp on priest is super fun though. Overall I really enjoy the class and if you like healing in PVE and can do anything on PVP
---
So you do think we need this reposted multiple times every day?
---
Oh it absolutely will, no doubt.
---
Luna Unit Frame, Enemy Raid Frames, Lazy Pig, and Bongos are the four obvious ones that I use that are missing from p servers. 
---
Hopefully some one will port those or make something similar.
---
Thanks for this OP
---
I didnt really know much about Esfand before all this, I tuned in a few times on twitch to see him in the red cap and got kinda put off. Seems like such a genuinely nice guy!
---
Sorry friend but those are facts. This will shatter your worldview. But the (unfactual) claims you posted earlier where the result of spending far too much time on propaganda subs.
---
That doesn't require any glitches you can literally just make a short jump on this one place east of IF and run there.
---
BFA is single player
---
There's actually a lootable quest in the water down there.
---
I think this is a troll and doubt the addon actually works properly.
---
Considering his stance on the state of classic retail clearly doesn't suit him, he preferres his own recollections than the actual experience
---
Ahh, I added some things in edits afterwards that I should have made sure of before I posted, sorry.  So the clip doesn't show auto-shot, but I did note the maximum melee range there, like a pixel behind the wolf's tail, and you did mark that right with the 3y line.  Plus that melee range looks totally normal to me.
---
So I'll take your word for it that your 8y mark was the min auto-shot range by this guy.  If that's the case, then yeah, the min range is too far for some reason.  It should be just behind your 5y line.
---
Yeah but then we'll have to deal with things like flying mounts and old raids/old world being obsolete, which is what a lot of us want to avoid.
---
It's funny because if you actually look at the population distribution of the US, there are far fewer blacks in total than there are whites in the US. What you liked does not say the the distribution between whites, blacks, and Hispanics of the 170K they interviewed. So yeah, on a per 1000 person basis, the white demographic is going to show higher numbers than the black demographic, just by the fact the white demographic is larger than the other two. Unless they state that the interviewed participants were an even 33.3% split, than whites will be the higher split, which would cause their numbers to increase.
---
So all that is really saying for sure is that people below the poverty line commit about 2x more crimes than those in high-income households, it does not give a very accurate representation based on race though.
---
Ofcourse not, im of the view that both retail and classic are great games for what they offer. Bfa is lackluster for sure, but legion was the most fun ive had in wow maybe ever. 
---
There are just so much toxicity towards anyone who even mention they enjoy retail that all of these memes feel like (even though they arent) they are targeting everyone with a 120 character.
---
I enjoy playing RP PVP servers. But I hate having gear in my bank just because it looks cool. It's such a waste of bank space.
---
Also it's kinda lame to have level 20 blues that look cool, but get tossed out next time you run a dungeon.
---
It can be fun to have guilds with "matching" uniforms and keep that RP in the RPG.
---
I list quite a few examples of other games classics over-taking their modern counterparts. I am sure it's possible for the same to happen for WoW.
---
lol bfa hemorrhaged a large amount of its players in around the same amount of time. I have a feeling you might be very surprised.
---
whatever you say, pumped up kicks
---
As someone who has been playing on a private server for the past 12 months and am in Naxx right now and loving it (prior to this I hadn’t played WoW since 2007), I am just so damn excited for real Blizz Quality servers running a 15 year old game.
---
I’m not the only one either... one of the guys in my guild went to get a job so he could afford a sub. I wish I was joking.
---
I was gonna make a joke about Blizzard discriminating against us europeans and how we should revolt in opposition, but I just got sad instead.
---
You typed 1v1 me bro. You're confused with yourself
---
It's not a perfect range check obviously, but I believe you can get the idea. Like you said most creatures have a hitbox of 0.5 yards. And range checks seem to be based on the outer edge of the hitbox, not the center. Take a drake, or patchwerk or ragnaros for example. The hitbox is huge, but the range check starts at the edge. That's why I used the edge as a basis for checks.  
---
The twitch clip from beta starts at minimum range btw.. No need to actually auto-shoot because you have rangechecks on the abilities themselves
---
Killing the dragon in moonglade crashed our server once or twice.
---
It could just be because of spell batching, something nobody except one guy wanted that somehow made its way into the game.
---
Will classic remain at lvl 30? Once the max level is reached, what will guilds do after say 5 years? Thinking in particular on end game raids. Are there any mid-long term plans from blizz/guilds?
---
Yeah, this is a pretty bad comparison. The fight was organized between two streamers purposefully. It wasn't “organic” and everyone was in raid groups.
---
I would still like to see a Gnome/Dwarf do the run since they're one of the best races. I imagine you can get to level 4/5 in under an hour with Ironforge+Stoemwind+Redridge+Westfall flight paths and hearth to Goldshire.
---
If a streamer does it people can also give them level 5 vendor gear and buff them up, they should be equal to the pack in terms of leveling, but I imagine having really good flight paths will reduce travel time when going to those zones which should put a person slightly ahead.
---
I'm still not sure about how layering will affect this as some people may have a better time just questing.
---
Once people get T2, particularly weapons, PvP starts to become twinking at 60. If you can PvP often once they drop PvP gear, then you can be competitive
---
Objection! If you're going to count discord, then we had vbulletin and invision fansite forums.
---
Wow that sounds..... awful.
---
Gonna keep waiting for Classic over here. *whistles*
---
wpvp is all about disorder. Surprise and aggression win most fights.
---
Layering will have zero effect on this. It's just not worth your time compared to the XP you'd gain from killing mobs and questing.
---
Ah common americans call everybody a racist who they dont like so fuck off with that bullshit argument, thats not an argument just slander.
---
Absolutely, you will only see fps dip on modern machines when in main cities and staring at a hundred players. Even most integrated graphics should do fine if they optimize it well.
---
I like private servers for what they are. I dislike people who think private servers are bibles where everything is 100% correct, they're incredibly stupid.
---
It's completely reasonable to expect that when we moved to burning Crusade the population will get much bigger, and possibly even bigger than that after we get to Wrath.
---
Stormwind was destroyed in Warcraft 1 not 2
---
Kk let me just gank that lvl 45 as I just entered STV as a lvl 30.
---
Oh, I guess I should say that I think it should be toon locked.
---
Warlocks also have the ability to anchor flags in AB with their pets to stop rogues from ninja capping. And they have endlessly more utility and ability to spread dots than a shadow priest. Curse of tongues can completely turn a clash between two teams, even if it just takes 1 global to dispel.
---
They also believe that it's a huge conspiracy on Blizzards part trying to sneak in as many changes as possible without our knowledge. They're morons.
---
I've seen them tank onyxia and MC bosses!
---
Cry me a fucking river
---
Do you mean lvl 60? I'd stay Classic offers so much that everyone will be busy for atleast 3 years. Even after that most people won't have Naxx on farm.
---
wow! big surprise that people have opinions different than the reddit circlejerk and you!
---
almost as if jontron is *allowed to think for himself*! how dare he!
---
They banned specific addons in the past. Considering a lfg/lfr addon only works when many people use it, that would be a very easy and effective way to shut this down.
---
Then you don't play on any server that progresses to TBC.
---
"So all that is really saying for sure is that people below the poverty line commit about 2x more crimes than those in high-income households, it does not give a very accurate representation based on race though."
---
That IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING. Crime is based off of average income level and the property values of the surrounding area... Race has nothing to do with it.
---
To be fair it's not about how organic it is but how organic it feels. It's all in the perception.
---
druid most likely
---
dwarf priest is always a demand
---
Yeah hes insanely good aswell. Some proper enjoyable montages and seems to be a fun dude.
---
I never played Rag and Ultima, but I played L2 since C4 and as far I remember, the game only started to die because of P2W elements, before that everything was fine. That's why Hellbound/Kamael, Interlude and Gracia servers are way popular, even High Five. That's not the case with WoW besides the level thing that you can buy.
---
You're confusing current active players with total players. pservers have 100,000 players but usually only around ~10k active on them at any single given moment.
---
I love it and will continue to use it.
---
You respecc at your Classtrainer. The first respecc costs 1g and then it goes up, which can get expensive.
---
As you're leveling you can easily heal a dungeon as a Ret or Prot Pala.
---
I'd level as a ret, which enables you to decently solo stuff, but since Pala is such a good hybrid you're still able to heal and tank.
---
The guy who made it saidosne of them (elv pf shagu whatever) will.
---
Yes, but when they do new content, you'd think they'd probably expand on WotLK as that's where most people would have progressed to instead of going back to classic to add new content.
---
&gt; Damn... I miss him :(
---
1 year ago in 4 days. :(
---
That was a paraphrase, if you even know what that means. Here is this better?:
---
"Just scrap fair vs fair"
---
"I'll legitimately go out slaying every player my level wherever I go if it's a fair 1v1 scenario"
---
Most of the times it was Druids. I'd say no one complains if there are too much Priests and Warlocks too!
---
He doesn't want to play pally I guess
---
They would tell you to stop being a casual pve carebear, but it's a valid point. I think BGs are fine, I just think there should be some kind of incentives for world pvp. Even if they just made open world HKs worth like 3x honor vs a BG HK
---
I need this. Please do it. 
---
no /s from my side
---
He did a multiple hour long debate with destiny where he aired his racist views for all to hear, it's not really up for you to misrepresent him.
---
Hence the problem with expansions. The whole MMO/expansion paradigm is flawed at its core.
---
Stacking content on top of each other is incredibly destructive. To this day I haven't seen a single MMO that truly gets around this problem.
---
Yeah I'm not super well educated on all class specs in vanilla but I think you got the point I was trying to make, meme specs I guess you can call it.
---
This is exactly why I argued hard against spell batching. Yes it has gimmicky behavior in PvP but it has a lot of annoying side effects where even if you play the game right you'll still fail.
---
Blizzard has actually stated that there's NO benefits of having an older account to a new. Iirc there was a screenshot yesterday (?) on this subreddit of a conversation with an employe saying that it's chosen random as long as you have Beta Testing turned on @battle.net !   
---
So we all just have to hope i guess.   
---
Good luck!
---
All those are Pre-GoD content. Which I agree are very popular, I play on l2 clubs sometimes, but man... do I miss my Kamael Berserker sometimes.
---
every class is gonna be played, no matter what you pick you're not a unique snowflake
---
therefore pick what is most aesthic to you and ignore everything else
---
&gt; something that wasn't really available elsewhere.
---
Mhhh i think thats what every MMORPG then and after provided. Because i had this "Social Media" feel in MMOs when i just started out playing MMOs (and it wasnt WoW) i was 13/14 when i got my PC and that was 2007 so, had the same feel from Shitty F2P MMos that where extremly popular among kids here in Europe. 
---
Also 2004 when WOW came out there was allready EvE Online, SW Galaxies and the other mmos which are argubly very social.
---
The underlying reasons are different and specific to each individual. I agree, there is something strangely paradoxical about wanting to be put in a small, familiar box giving one a sense of joy. I've previously guess it has something to do with in current wow, you hit maximum level and you have 500,000 different things you can do. To get gear or progress. And in for many people hey Cat Loki overwhelmed for feel the need to do everything, complete everything at the end, and it increase is there burnout. In classic when you hit maximum level there are very specific things only that you can do to progress and get gear.
---
It's also a question of individually can each of us revert our mindsets to appreciate the more primitive, more demanding thing that is a classic effort to reward to time ratio.
---
Think about how much you can accomplish in BFA when you hit maximum level and play for three more hours. Think of how much gear you could get in that time. Then think about how much gear or things you could accomplish 3 hours after hitting 60 in classic. It's like night and day and to be expected.
---
None of you realize that both use push to talk when speaking to each other.
---
They have no idea of knowing when the other is talking to chat or telling a story to the stream.
---
I would love for Streamers to have "secret" events where they don't turn on the stream until their raid is already mobilized, but I don't know how plausible that is. Probably not very. Guess we'll find out!
---
Personally I just missed the info. Heard about the basement guy when they announced classic but didn't know who it was.
---
The priest gameplay feels really good shadow really fits my play style cause I like dots and I love that mindflay slows. Healing feels really good with good oh shit buttons in PW:S and desperate prayer for myself. One thing that takes some getting use to is when you are wanding you have to actively stop wanding before you cast a spell and just moving does completely auto cancel it you have to actually hit your wand key there may be work around on this, but I haven't found it. 
---
Leveling goes really smoothly with no down time when you get psychic scream you can handle sketchy situations. I like using powerword shield while leveling to just avoid damage. sperg tell me I'm dumb and should just renew,but to each their own.
---
Nice to hear. Keep spreading the word.
---
The case will be the opposite, every "vanilla hardcore" will be surprised when the user base of classic starts to go back to Retail after a few months. The amount of players who really care about Achievements, Mount and Pets collections, Seasons, new mogs, etc are way too big, they will be hyped for the next exp way more than classic.
---
This is my favorite nickname I have ever recieved
---
Whoa really? One less addon. Does Classic also have item glow (green, blue, purple) in the bags? Because then I don't need OneBag either.
---
No shit this is why I quit as soon as TOC came out in wotlk.
---
We've had addons since day 1 of WoW so I feel fine about them. Might even get back into addon development like I did back then. 
---
Sure some modern addons are better than what we had in 2004-06, but that's a good thing in my eyes.
---
When was this time ? Because on Youtube people allways liked to make long videos talking about stuff they enjoy talk about... even before 2011 where youtubers start to do it for money.
---
All it takes is one turbo stack of around 15 players and the streamers can dream of R14 because they will set impossible brackets, earning honor twice as fast.
---
I ran some strings through my internal database and analyzed all possible possibilities and came to the conclusion that this person is right.
---
&gt; Am i a joke to you?
---
Yes.
---
Yeah that's exactly my point :D either the melee range is too short (0-3) or the min range isn't actually 8 yards.   
---
Compared to pserver picture at the top, it was the same but much easier to see range because I chose the dock with clear lines. However, looking at the actual DB from the WoW client it states that in the demo hunter range was 8-35, and melee was 0-5... but I don't have the demo to confirm that, so it seems the beta is off OR it's always been like that. Either way it seems off and that's the point of the post is to bring some light on it.
---
Honestly just having clutch fearwards and heals in that battle was the highlight of my day also helping friend farm WW axe
---
One of my favorite memories is "tanking" BRD on an alt mid 50s warrior using Ice Barbed Spear with my warrior cousin as off tank using the epic sword that can be acquired from Zul'Farrak. I told the healer as long as they have mana I'm pulling, everyone better keep up, and if you need to stop let me know. 
---
The entire time the other 3 in our group were complaining and crying about how stupid we were being yet... we didn't wipe once or come close and we cleared the instance in record time. Oh yeah, me and my cousin did about 80% of the total damage while the other 2 dps barely registered on the meter. It was glorious and I can't wait to recklessly turn instances upside down to the dismay of my group
---
ALSO I just realized by looking up your reddit account that your most active subreddits are 1) ApexLegends 2) FortniteBR and 3) Rocket League so I was right about you being a toxic FPS playing child.
---
The grass looks great but there's a problem with it growing out of places it shouldn't, like rock textures on the ground
---
[Now we wait for the stress test to see if it works on the classic client.](https://i.imgur.com/j2xXLPz.png) It should because the chat functions probably are the same.
---
The name Joan is pronounced "JONE" (not to be confused with Joann, pronounced "jo-ANN") so he applied that to Joana.
---
Yeah. Not a ton of BIG wow streamers right now (though that may change!). There's some like Shroud who play wow but it's not their primary thing. He's playing a few games a day when I see him on Twitch. Maybe that'll also change. idk.

Did I miss anyone important?
---
Does the death warp out of Dun Morgoh to Menethil Harbor still work in the beta?
---
We were a decent guild and got all of spider wing and noth down. I miss that so much.
---
This is exactly classic druid.
---
I also only have like 1-2 hours a day to play games because of my job. But still I prefere spending them in classic. The reason is: even with less time you can something done. Like leveling professions for 1-2 points, doing some small quests, grinding mobs for mount and so on and so on.
---
It really is laughable
---

---
yep... A Warriors Inventar before the first AQ Raid...
---
I-F-LOVE-IT
---
He hated the casualisation of WoW in Cataclysm onwards so I reckon he'd have loved it. He was always very short tempered with WoW though.
---
It's like the more people play in the more burned-out they get, the play style of each successive WoW expansion encouraged getting people in their cars on the rails so they can move from point to point and collect their specific reward. Like a warfront.
---
The people who are fighting in a a r a t h i or South Shore Tarren Mill in classic, there is no magical tangible reward for that. Or rather than reward is the feeling, the enjoyment, things that don't come in the color purple.
---
But it does have something to do with race, because on a national level, black commit more crime than other races. I know what you are saying, and agree with that point, it really does not matter, but statistically speaking, blacks commit more crimes than other races nationally. 
---
It can't be determined from this data, but where ever Jon got his info that rich blacks commit more crimes than poor whites, it would potentially be feasible considering that blacks in general commit more crimes, yet they make up far less of the overall population than whites, so if you are using averages based on the entire population, it could make sense.
---
I remember beta testing actual vanilla wow where the same bug occured. 
---
This was a bug in vanilla wow beta aswell.
---
The only addons Blizzard has ever made a violation of the ToS were Babelfish and UTran, which both allowed cross-faction communication, and yet they remain in use today.
---
Blizzard can't ban addons on a technical level, they're purely on the client. The only thing Blizzard can do is limit what the addon API allows and doesn't allow. Good examples of this are Decursive and AVR. They came out and Blizzard eventually limited the API not to allow their "broken" functionality.
---
To limit the functionality of a LFG/LFR addon, which really only needs access to chat and player data, Blizzard would have to remove just about all addon functionality, which isn't going to happen.
---
There will be a LFG/LFR addon and there's nothing Blizzard can do about it.
---
Let's hope we as OG players embrace newcomers, so that classic may live on for a long time. I don't think your 2 months is correct, it will be blasting for quite some time.
---
I see. I always assumed the feminine name was chosen for his female troll character.
---
Despite leveling in desolace I've never managed to do the khan quests or find my way around that bloody cave. I will defeat it this time!
---
I started in Burning Crusade, played the Wrath Alpha then quit shortly after Wrath came out. I guess I was a little too used to my old games at the time and maybe a little elitist, back then WoW players were affectionately called WoWbabies across all MMOs I played. But I am happy you guys are getting what you guys asked for and I'd actually like to try the Vanilla WoW experience, now that I am older and need a more casual MMO :\^)
---
Try leveling a herbalism for a while and you will turn it to minimum faster than you can say #nochanges.
---
Classic isnt even that hardcore of an MMO, it's just that retail has become so overly convenient to the point that you think having to communicate with someone in a MMO is masochistic.
---
I never said you were shitting on Blizzard dude. I was referring to the dude you replied to.
---
I remember that and Destiny was a bitch thats what i remember :D the stuff John said where not racist man. Thats what i mean nowdays those slander words are sooooo thin that everything is racist or nazi. Even critizing a Religion can count as racism now in many minds, thats just sick.
---
Hey, i've got nothing to contribute to this thread -- i just wanted to thank you for all the great vids and guides on classic. As a father of two very young childrens, my time escapes me -- its not easy keeping up with everything, but you have made me up to par on what to expect. Looking forward to hit lvl 60 about 6-12 months in... haha.
---
Thanks again!
---
I really doubt he would like it.
---
Classic is about sooo much more than gear. And I love it!
---
Lack of?
---
yeah I am stuck too. Now I am adding mage in the mix lololol    those teleports tho heheh
---
Warm and fuzzie are first 2 words in my mind when thinking about nixxiom vids
---
i seriously fear, that addons (tons of addons, not 3 or 4) and elitists will destroy vanilla :(
---
and at the same time, the fewer options or ways to get gear makes it all the more valuable. you polish the shit out of that breastplate because four buddies slogged through  BRD with you and helped you get it
---
Dude you are a legend
---
Just 1 of these kinds are allowed here.  
---
except for the pala' because of Horde faction.
---
Also, what has Arcane mage for purpose in Pve , not sure if we'd allow that.
---
Afaik you will be sent to your class trainer somewhere in your startong zone(s) for each class quest
---
I don't want him to end up like previous Horde warchiefs
---
It's only in the beta they have a level 30 cap to limit the testing to that level range. In classic the max level cap is 60.
---
providing that the layering works as intended then it shouldn't be too rammed, as for quests not too sure how that will work as i never tried going to a different starting zone in vanilla but i cant see as there will be much of an issue, if you really want to be on the safe side before going to meet your mate run to org and grab the FP as well as the other in the barrens that will allow you to fly back in the event you can't grab the class quests.
---
Im torn on this one. I would love some newly created vanilla content, would be really interesting to see what they come up with, but i also want vanilla to eventually end, for me personally vanilla is not my favorite itteration of WoW, BC/WOTLK is. But i totally understand that people want classic to last as long as possible.
---
If that's true. we should make ourselves heard(politely) to open beta to EU.
---
Post here and post on the official forums.
---
Don't worry about these nerds; you'll find happy and fun nerds in game who will be stoked to party up and hang out. Be weary of hardcore raiding guilds, they could be toxic, but I'm sure that still exists today.
---
MC was frostbolts.
---
BWL was arcane missiles. 
---
Naxx was fireballs.
---
Was interesting how the spec evolved but the vanilla gearing made it easy.
---
I've been planning out a Holy Paladin stacking a bunch of +spell damage gear, and I can't find solid answers as to whether +spell damage applies to a few niche things in vanilla: procs from a Skullflame Shield? Gnomish Death Ray? Thanks.
---
You should download DBM and do a /range command with party members. This may get you some more exact numbers in BFA
---
No one knows. But I don't think so.
---
There has been a daily trickle of new people declaring they just got in.
---
No one knows for sure how often or how many are being invited.
---
&gt;I think it's pretty disingenuous to think that the Horde just "happened" upon Asmon doing his quest when there's screenshots of them sitting in his chat while the battle was going on.
---
My point was that Tips was probably sitting there waiting for the next Alliance Warrior Streamer to ding 30 with full intention of getting a raid together to PvP.
---
I can't confirm this because it didn't appear that he was streaming at the time.
---
&gt; You also missed the bigger problem with sharding, they could have been phasing in and out while they were trying to fight at Thoradin's Wall. 
---
The bit point in my opinion is how you can not only follow someone, but can also anticipate where they are going to be to ambush them. It's a true single world (at least the Beta, we still need more information about Layering).
---
I'm only specifically avoiding asmon, soda, and towelliees servers. Guys like shroud and lirik will move on fairly quickly, so those servers will balance back out.
---
That dosnt Really Help, they Just would say Play in Stress Test lol
---
Watching large scale Vanilla PvP with NO lag is just too cool. Can't wait to play.
---
I would stay in your area, I think the fuckery will be had and not worth the pain
---
QuestHelper came out in TBC but I wouldn't be surprised if someone made a similar addon for Classic. I started in 2007 so I pretty much had QuestHelper installed from the get go.
---
I can almost guarantee you that it will be, at least for a few months after launch (and likely after)
---
Afaik people don't like BfA too much, I don't even play it so I can't really comment. I played legion but BfA seemed poorly executed . 
---
Anyway, I think classic will have huge amounts of players, I think it will blow estimates out of the water.
---
Asmongold is consistently getting 50k+ viewers just leveling. It's nuts
---
In older and more mature games, I find the player-base to be more friendly. I recall coming back to Ultima Online after a very long time and people spent the time to help me tame difficult and rare monsters, train them and was even given millions of gold. I'm certain the Vanilla WoW OGs will be just as accommodating.
---
Just level to 10 separately and then meet at the crossroads.
---
My friend wont be able to play on launch anyway, only the day after, so i can spend that time running around getting the FP's if i need to go back.
---
About the layering and populated zones. Im 100% sure that it will be unplayable at launch, unless they increase the spawnrate of mobs/quest items (which they wont). Ive watched alot of beta content and just with the few people that are in there, some of the quests are stalled because of other people being there, with just the people from beta. Imagine the amount of people at launch.
---
Asmon’s side lost? Can someone fill me in on how? Was all alliance before I had to switch off!
---
could u try getting to dancing troll village? :D
---
This article is so rubbish, thanks for reminding me why I hate polygon. Its written as an opinion piece in the guise of a serious article.
---
It feels like someone wrote an unbiased article and then a child came in and wrote a bunch of smart assy one liners after every original sentence.
---
It would be impossible to quest, you will experience this in phase 2.
---
People making themselves heard has gotten us this far. It certainly doesn't hurt nor take much time.
---
They've changed their minds before after the community pushed. The EU folks should push:)
---
Why do people ride expensive bikes when motorised scooters exist that would take them to their destination just as well that wouldn’t even cost more?
---
Because of the feeling of accomplishment once they get there. 
---
Retail hands you everything on a platter. There’s no skill involved in aggroing everything in. Sight and AOEing it down. The game even tells you where to go in order to do so, with markers and arrows pointing the way. There is no sense of accomplishment in that.
---
Yea we killed him a couple of times before Christmas break and one or two times after (until TBC hit). The last raid was a joint raid together with a Spanish guild on the realm (forgot the name).
---
Wow looks like you got brigaded hard by some risen up gamers. It's like pserver barrens chat up in here
---
Jealous classic haters is not a thing. They literally don't exist. You created some imaginary boogeyman in your head.
---
I think shrouds actually said he wishes he could play dota2 as his main game but his viewers would tank.
---
Wow that's quite promising, the only streamer I regularly watch gets only 300 views, but it's not gaming related.
---
widepeepoHappy
---
Prob gonna be mage rogue warr hunter priest if I had to guess
---
I think a good standard for determining difficulty is wheter they are designed to kill or or designed to be alive for 15 seconds.
---
Yes i am sure you are more skilled than Venruki at WoW PvP. When he catches up to the meta he'll obliterate you.
---
Once you realize that just about everything he says is a sarcastic act/satire, he becomes pretty entertaining.
---
Even tips admitted that the mob abilities were different and that the AI in the beta was WAAAY better than pservers. Makes sense to me. Good AI is pretty hard.
---
Asmon didn’t really intend to do the whole world
---
PvP thing, I wouldn’t say it was organized, unless asmon is lying about that and I don’t think so
---
i was thinking on this the other night while levelling a shaman to 120 and it occurred to me that while levelling the only person i spoke to was my other half who was sat next to me on her computer, even when i joined LFG for quests in dungeons i never needed to talk to someone just click a button and run it like it's my own little instance.
---
then i remembered being stood in org at level 60 back in vanilla not being able to do anything if i didn't talk to people and I realised that's why i want classic because BFA just feels like a levelling sim until level 120 when you start raiding
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
Thank you for the answer! 😊
---
Spot on, my fellow adult dude :D
---
I have this hunch that some people feel proud they didn't "break the rules" and join a pserver and with the announcement of a virgin classic wow theyve since become puritanical about putting down pserver content at every turn.
---
Cool! From what I remember Kor'gall had a pretty good horde/alliance balance. Did you check [https://www.vanillafriends.com/](https://www.vanillafriends.com/)? There were names of guilds in there that I haven't heard in 13 years, but somehow still existed in the back of my mind :-)
---
No you didn't
---
It amazes me how people cant grasp the idea of not being able to buy into beta.
---
Start with Classic is my tip :p
---
Yes especially with classic in August lol.
---
Does the beta have weather or have they fucked us?
---
What's worse is that its goths irritating ass.
---
I was just asking a question :) dont worry I deleted it so i wouldn't trigger more easily triggered people :)
---
To the people who are used to playing wow as a hack n slash and killing mobs by the dozens then it will be hard, or atleast they will have to change their placestyle to fit the slower pace of vanilla.
---
Joana , who I enjoy watching cuz I want to learn little niche tricks for lvling quicker, had like 800 viewers tonight around 11 PST . 
---
He's not even a "big" name (to us he is but gaming community overall compared to like shroud etc) and 800 is enough to put some money in your pocket at least .. idk maybe it's the hype but I'm hoping for a solid turnnout 
---
I'm scared people see that it's going to take them real commitment to get to 60 and quit early. I think most people still playing after 2 months are in for the long haul.
---
Ow yikes, I wasn't aware of that. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
As much hate as there is. Both retail and classic are proper games. I'd suggest trying both.  If you like them play them.
---
.....tho it is a bit like starting a drug. The addiction is real. That applies to both retail and classic:)
---
Cdew.  He is also a rank 1 pvp shaman on retail wow. Very skilled and pretty chill.
---
Brother, it is never to late to throw your life in the gutter.
---
Seriously though if you have some life shit going in (college, family) and you don't have a strong will power you should stear clear.
---
It's a good game. You'll spend so much time leveling your character that you will become intimately acquainted with its mechanics so if you aren't shit you will excel at 60
---
We're only making it hard for the retail guys who shit all over vanilla. Many of whom has been shitting on the general idea of vanilla servers for years. Even mocking us for even suggesting it.
---
In my experiences I've never really found people around my own level unless it's people much lower than myself.  It's usually people in groups ready to gank from much higher levels.
---
The only exception for that was on retail wow during BFA with the new pvp system.
---
Reality = auto downvote for people :(
---
PvP is timeless for you, sure.
---
Yeah, nah. If I wanna swing swords at people, I'll play a game like Mordhau or something. You do you tho.
---
???
---
I will be having fun, thank you. So I'm supposed to be bored out of my mind, playing the game in a way I don't enjoy, in order to please a random redditor, or else it doesn't make sense? Ok dude.
---
Cool. So is PvE
---
Janky, hotkey-mmo-rock-paper-scissors pvp, where engineering is near required, bleh. I'll pass on the whole concept.
---
It will help blizzard prepare for launch day
---
it wasnt on this account, it was back in legion a few years ago
---
it was epic to watch
---
The servers having a meltdown when there is more than 20 people on the screen.
---
And just think, they didn't even plan to have expansions at first. The original plan was to have a quest after naxx to open the dark portal. I guess eventually there would have been too much content but still, just think of what could have been
---
Although i welcome your optimisn, its 1 Week into beta and people would watch asmongold doing literally ANYTHING. in the past weve seen how fast game hype can die and in the end we gotta trust that blizzard paces classics content right so we got a healthy sized community going.
---
Find the post then.
---
Oh sweet summer child.
---
if i remember right you can get exalted with all factions without cloth but you need to go and do all the quests, i may be wrong on this as it has been about 12-13 years since vanilla and other things were added in that time for rep gains i may be forgetting about.
---
i think cloth was just the "easy" way of doing it since you just farm or buy tons of cloth and then hand it in and don't need to go find all the little quests that give the rep
---
im not digging through a thousand mythic chest posts just because you can't take my word sir
---
If he thinks that way then he has already lost regardless of what he does. Either he sucks it up for viewers and hates his life on a PVP server, or he enjoys himself on a PVE server but hates his low viewers.
---
I remember watching him do a low level trivial dungeon in Legion and he literally ate every mechanic. Giant swirls on ground, obvious frontal cleave. He was 100% the reason they failed the key. Dreadful player.
---
You should look up the recent 40v40 pally vs dk video. It's... Fucking depressing. Tldr= server rip. Can't even handle a 40v40 *battleground war game.*
---
That was the sadest thing i saw today! I feel you bro „/hug“
---
Well same, but even if I get one-shotted by a level 60 every single time, I still prefer that to having no pvp. And by the way, I've only ever been on the receiving end of ganking, and I still fully support it.
---
Not at all. No changes.
---
Unfortunately when they add PVP rewards it's going to ruin WPVP again.
---
Cataclysm had a nice Talentsystem tho.. i liked when turning lvl 10 it gave you a Special skill and everything. Was also kinda more challanging to level then WotLK... at least as a mage.
---
The thing I'm most afraid of is that they're doing it on purpose. Not sure in which video it was discussed (I believe HeelsVsBabyface) but it showed a timeline of all WoW releases. 
---
It showed that Blizzard really took into account the playtime people had. So for example something took 5 weeks to complete and then 3 weeks after that, they release a new patch. This makes it so that you have nothing to do for 3 weeks and then RIGHT WHEN YOUR GAME TIME ENDS, new content gets released.
---
They know what we want, but they don't give it to us. They just give us the bare minimum to keep our attention.
---
What part of anything that I just said advocates for a massive change in class mechanics?
---
People do this shit every time they are presented with an argument that they can't refute. They take the argument presented to them, exaggerate it so much that it wasn't even close to what was said, and throw it back at the person. 
---
No. Warriors dont need aoe, they have it in arms. No they don't need self healing as Prot/Fury just like rogue doesnt need it in modern either. 
---
What i fucking stated was, and read this carefully so you actually understand the argument placed in front of you:
---
Balance Druids
---
Elemental Shaman
---
Enhancement Shaman
---
Protection Paladin
---
Feral Tank Druid
---
Feral DPS Druid
---
Shadow Priest
---
Retribution Paladin
---
Survival Hunter
---
These Specs were designed to do something specific in the game, some are good at things, some aren't.
---
However the following classes are only bad, and not taken to raids:
---
Balance Druid
---
Because. They. Can. Not. Sustain. Their. Mana. Through. A. Single. Boss. Encounter. These specs were singled out because a GAME DESIGNER didn't like the idea of hybrid classes. Instead of mana issues Protection Paladin, Retribution Paladin, Feral DPS Druid, and Feral Tank Druid are all lacking tools to actually be effective in the roles that the spec was designed for. Again, because a Game Designer  *DIDN'T LIKE* them.
---
I know you dont want your vitally important classic to be touched by mortal hands past what is needed, but that is just terrible game design, and frankly unfair to hybrid classes, who without tweaks to *JUST THEIR NUMBERS* will NEVER be remotely as useful as their pure counterparts.
---
I'm done arguing this point, because its painfully obvious you dont actually want Classic to be improved. You just want another #FRESH Private server to hop to, level to max in 3 weeks, clear Nax asap then move on to the next.
---
&gt; Because they didn’t add armor to it
---
How do we know that was done on purpose though? It could be a bug, hence the feature.
---
&gt; why does it need armor? 
---
No one said it does, but if other default gear items have it, then why not?
---
&gt; Every starting zone gives you boots with no stats
---
That may be the case with Classic, but they've always had at the very least armour.
---
the mobs spawn rate vs players is my main concern about the launch of classic and my hope is the plan for layering to balance the loads should help but i'm not hopeful that it will solve the issue
---
Of course! You're an adult. Do whatever you want. Be warned though... WoW = Gaming crack. I've been clean for a few years. But the new classic flavour finds me being pulled back in for that vanilla nostalgia buzz.
---
Report the bug. This is what beta is for.
---
I honestly believe something is deeply wrong with nochange extremists like you.
---
There are no damage numbers at all before he lands the sunder, there is however a very consistent pair of resists popping up every time the mob hits him.
---
Yes, and i kinda answered you aswell through not being able to understand your point of view. Beta Testers are selected after many criteria, money thrown at blizzard isnt one of them.
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome.
---
Lmao what does the kid say 
---
"What the guys in that prince movie?"
---
"Yeah purple rain."
---
"That shit was so gay" 
---
LMFAO

---
is there an official date for release?
---
Hahaha that hits close to home. I'm currently busy graduating so I have plenty to do, no worries ;).
---
Even if true the next expansion will be a year away when classic launches
---
now that looks exactly like my character screen back then. true vanilla, happy you got in the beta.
---
As far as I remember there was a mana detonation debuff that will make you explode for half your mana, which made it incredibly difficult to sustain your dps through such a long fight. Keeping MC'd people sheeped also gave quite some downtime on DPS.
---
Upvoted for the reference
---
August 27
---
I'm a bit of an idiot with Twitch.  I realized I could just go to the full video from the Clips page, slow it down to 0.25x speed, and look at the moments his hotkeys for Auto Shot and Arcane Shot aren't and then are red.  I know I should trust you, but I just like to be overly thorough about these things, no offense.  So I was able to confirm that what you marked as 8 yds is technically when his hotkeys for Auto Shot and Arcane Shot turn red.
---
Yeeeah, that min range looks considerably too far to me.
---
I’ve recently had a discussion about how and why vanilla was more enjoyable.  Suddenly I came to the realization that the mechanics and design philosophies of retail resemble the trends we experience happening IRL. Instant gratification, a hectic lifestyles, hate culture, advertisements everywhere, online services. 
---
WoW equivalents?
---
Instant Gear, questhelpers, collections and achievements forcing a subconscious drive to fulfill these expactions (like ads IRL). Don‘t start me on toxic player community...
---
And the equivalent to reallife online services? That thing called groupfinder....
---
Just like many people are saying life was simpler back then... and this also applies to WoW... it was just a world, where you met friends, learned from them, taught them and most of all chilled with them.
---
but some people who don't like the idea of PVP rewards, they'll 'like' the pvp rewards again because they'll have played through the time when there were no PVP rewards.
---
never know what you dislike now that, after going without it for awhile, welcome its return
---
or maybe not, lol. but that's just it...we're going back through wow. there's gonna be new feelings and shit about things we feel
---
I got in, im not a streamer.
---
I personally like the one from AQ40, but this one is very cool, especially that animation.
---
Atleast he remembered to block this time. No more "[AND DOWN GOES VENRUKI!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q5pb-fEQhs)" :\^)
---
Yes loads of good men get banned for dumb reasons. Or shadowbanned where everything automatically filters to spam
---
No one wants to gimp themselves compared to everyone else.
---
Everyone has to play by the same rules, it adds impact to the things you do.
---
Cant wait to group up with 4 of the 50 people waiting for Sarkoth to respawn in Valley of trials.
---
He's right tho
---
1. Will classic get OCE servers?
---
2. Do you think there will be many oce players? (even if question 1 is a no)
---
3. Should I do some research on classes and on the game in general before I play? (The most I have tried/ looked at of WOW was a level 20 free trial account around WOD)
---
4. Anything I should know before going in to classic? (I don't mind older graphics as long as I enjoy the content, I've enjoyed rs and osrs)
---
5. Any recommendations on class or faction? In other mmos i've enjoyed tanks, rogues, healers, mages and whatever else so I'm really not strict.
---
Well. They will dont Fail.
---
Sadly, no :(.
---
Streamers are great marketing for the game. Also with a couple of thousands people watching you find more bugs. People in this sub are just salty that they didn't get an invite, but about 30 streamers did.
---
Swifty? Most of these people haven't played vanilla in 13 years and their memories are influenced by retail the same way others are influenced by pservers.
---
I'm sure people getting their streamers mixed up doesn't cause any misunderstandings.
---
&gt; and find a way to put some of it back in retail.
---
People that enjoyed Vanilla/Classic left retail. Most of the people playing retail right now don't really want to play that kind of game. So it's pretty unlikely that they'll change retail in that way.
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
This is what is called target prioritization. Mages are squishy as balls to begin with for a reason. With him running in there like that, a stun of any kind to avoid the ice block, then everyone melts him.  Or just 2 people cause mages have literally 2 hp.
---
Guild Wars 2 kind of sort of didnt completely destroy doing old world activities. It did this at the expense of invalidating anything that wasnt the most efficient farming activity for God awful terrible rewards 99.9999999% of the time. 2 blues and a green anyone?
---
Not really sure how you would add content, outside of PvP, that wouldnt become problematic after a while. The only one that remotely makes sense is doing a balance pass on specs so that more become optimal for raiding. Any new raid tier adds power creep. I've seen some nonsense about adding offspec gear sets in raids past tier 3 but many offspecs arent raid optimal yet are quite powerful in PvP and would become horribly imbalanced with gear that would make it more raid optimal.
---
The one I'd like to see would be open world capturable keeps that are guild, not faction specific, that guilds could fight over that gave specific buffs for holding them. I guess you could add in Kara from TBC, tune it for 20 man and have it drop T2.5 gear? Adding a tier above 3 makes catch up mechanics brutal after a while
---
There’s nothing bad at all about “incorrect “ stats. First it’s the fun of the game to work out what to wear. Second you typically only compete with other members of your class, so even if tier sets have weird stats, so does everyone else
---
I wonder if the better AI will make hunter soloing DMN tribute impossible. Afaik it was only possible because King Gordok straight up forgot how to take the quickest path.
---
Nothing insane about it, a mage doing what a mage should.
---
I just dont understand why you have to be a smartass. I'm a fan, like you, and im just asking a question. Doesn't seem too silly to me to think I who gave blizzard 115 dollars should have a higher chance of being selected than someone who didn't. Obviously 15 of it is mandatory for sub, but idk, that's my point of view. I really don't think that's too controversial.

Currently retail players has had their dopamine center damaged by the instant gratification injections by way of epic loot.
---
Sort of like a heroin addict.
---
the whole shit started when he defended steve king on twitter...who has since been acknowledged as a racist even by his own party
---
add to that instant gratification cell phones  and mobile games. THOSE play a big role in showing what effort-reward model Blizzard has had to adopt  more and more to keep players coming back...and draw in new players.
---
AFK reward games on mobile...WHATS THE POINT? But millions play theem anyway. Likewise, AFK WoW rewards...we got 'em.
---
ehhh, toxic player community...far as I'm concerned, it's each individual person. you're in control of who you talk to, who you block or ignore, who you play with, and who you guild-up with. a community isn't toxic; specific people in it are, and with 'server community dynamics' coming back where your server reputation matters, people generally behave better because how others see them matters.
---
As far as I know, the Gnomish Death Ray does physical damage (i.e. the same school of damage as other physical abilities such as Heroic Strike). So stacking spell damage won't affect the damage it does.
---
I expect the largest demographic be those who play both. I doubt the whole Retail vs. Classic stuff will matter.
---
Why ban something thats about the game? I get that "oh this isn't a r/lifesteamfails" but thats a horrible argument in my opinion. It's about the game whether its a large streamer getting a sick drop getting camped or just a small streamer posting a clip of their awesome 1v2 outplay. I'm not saying that plugging their stream should be okay or not frowned upon but banning is a bad thing for such a simple thing that you can ignore.
---
There's everything wrong with incorrect stats. If the BIS gear is shitty and wastes allocation points on useless stats, then that's 100% an itemization issue that's holding you back. That's part of the reason vanilla WoW was so hard: None of that shit was optimized.
---
I know a lot of people here think that because there's a lot of complaints about BfA that classic being more popular is guarenteed but someone posted the clip the other day of the WoW dev explaining how WoW got changed so much from Classic to what it is now and they stated "All the feedback we got was negative, you never heard anything good because those people were out playing the game, we didn't think about that at the time, so we made changes" (Not a quote, that is an approximation of the sentiment).
---
The same will be true now for BfA. /r/WoW doesn't like it, neither does the forums, but the people that do are simply playing the game and not going online to rant like everyone else.
---
Not to say that you're going to be wrong, but it is something to consider. There's likely millions of people who love BfA and we just never hear their opinion because they either got bullied out of various echo chambers of complaints or just simply play the game a ton and don't discuss it outside their own circles.
---
This video goes straight to my favourites, I had so much fun watching it live
---
I don’t know man, it could actually work. I remember there were some addons back in vanilla that used chat channels for stuff like this. Like communicate each other via a specific chat channel. But i hope it wont, this will surely kill one of the major social aspects of the game
---
It's just simply making everything you do in game feel more meaningful to the player because you have to do a lot of things yourself that are normally just handed to you in games nowadays. And everything you do feels like an investment into your character, so it's not a time waste just for the sake of it. 
---
Take the flying mount problem for example. When you're allowed to fly, you make things easier for the player and save time, but it also makes them care less about he world itself because it does not really affect them anymore. But if you're forced to stay on the ground and  interact with the world you actually start paying attention to what's around you, not just the world itself, but everything that's in it. And there are tons of other little things in vanilla that are comparable to this example -  it takes a bit of time but it's so much more impactful because of it. All these small things add upp and it creates a world that feels real because of the players' investment in that world.
---
There is a reason the game was made this way and it's not because it's old and outdated game design. It's because this is kind of the foundation lf a good mmorpg. 
---
We're so used to things going at lightspeed in modern games, but it is actually really nice to have a relaxing experience once in a while, where you can just take things slow and not feel like you're wasting time because of it.
---
Yeah, sure. Might be a bit early to tell really. But I think it's a good sign when people play for such long sessions; it shows that they're enjoying it.
---
I think Renew is also quite mana inefficient.
---
Depends how they implement. In vanilla wow it was added in a late patch and even old GMs could not buy it. If it is out early though, it is indeed best weapon before Naxx.
---
As posted multiple times, great fucking game, super addictive. I just got back into it after a 3 year break and boy that was a mistake. Everything else on the back burner when I get into the game.
---
In my opinion people could be motivated by the upper bound limit in classic. People could stick around playing casually because there efforts won't disappear with a content patch or new expansion. They can play at their pace knowing efforts aren't futile.
---
Yeah, I always wanted that one, if I played a dwarf hunter.
---
They wouldn't do "stress tests" if they didn't want to test...
---
Could be. I guarantee Classic has better pathing than the pservers.
---
Fair point
---
Accurate as fuck
---
it is not about the damage, It is about leadership
---
he lead the raid, he lead the strategy and finally he charged in, making everyone else followed him and caused chaos in the enemies, leading to victory
---
it was epic
---
I agree that banning might not be the way to go. But as it is right now is quite annoying. It feels like most of the new posts is a twitch clip displaying nothing at all, contributing to nothing at all.  
---
I hope that the mods can find some middle ground while still allowing clips.
---
It is but let me tell you everyone in the beta was rank 14 best speed leveler world record holder and cleared neax world first and they know better then you
---
Are you ill? The vanilla frames were terrible and nobody used them, current frames are fine.

There were tons of casual players in vanilla. Why do you think it had such an enormous playerbase?
---
Just a reminder. BfA servers would have lagged really bad. This is really good news.
---
Alliance Warlocks.
---
You‘re right, community isn‘t the right word. Naturally it‘s up to the individual how to behave. But unfortunately people tend to act more like dicks the more anonymous they feel. Which is the case for many games nowadays and especially for the whole crossrealm shinanigans.
---
Very likely there will be OCE servers in classic, there are around 10-12 OCE servers on BFA WOW and many of those are high population or full.
---
&gt; The fight was organized between two streamers purposefully. It wasn't “organic” and everyone was in raid groups. 
---
If it was pre planned, Asmon was fairly good at acting. 
---
Asmon was pretty focused on just doing the quest. His initial raid was just large enough to be able to consistently be able to kill the level 38+ mobs for the Cyclonian quest.
---
He was in a raid group, but had a reason for it (The mobs for the quest are high level). 
---
Even after the initial ambush, Asmon returned to the quest.
---
It felt quite organic.
---
If it was in fact planned, they had a better crafted narrative than the current season of GoT.
---
Private servers use TBC rep values, you won't be hitting exalted anytime soon after 60.
---
I didn't know that about Guild Wars. Interesting.
---
It's hard to compare MMOs but EvE Online is another example of an MMO where content is “released” at essentially the same difficulty with the same-ish rewards.
---
But that's a sandbox MMO, where 90% of your gameplay is farming mats / consumables, and organizing an encounter. 10% of the gameplay is combat, which is pretty braindead. So actually it kinda does compare to Vanilla, lol.
---
&gt; The one I'd like to see would be open world capturable keeps that are guild, not faction specific, that guilds could fight over that gave specific buffs for holding them.
---
That's pretty much the focus of EvE Online gameplay. WPvP has always been fun in WoW. Not sure how many people would consider it a worthy endgame though.
---
I once read on an old ArsTechnica thread from Burning Crusade. It struck me as such an interesting perspective that I saved it:
---
&gt; “IMO what killed Wow were the patches that added new 40 man dungeons, thus making gear the only way to progress in the game. BWL, AQ and Naxx are just some of the things I never visited as a long-time WoW player, because of my real life schedule and were added only cause the hardcore players whined and moaned about it.”
---
Apparently some players back in the day hated the focus on endgame instances and how that “killed” open-world experiences.
---
What is there to contribute? More threads about people talking about how toxic a community is, or what class should I play? There are limited things to post at the moment as there is a beta phase. When news comes out its instantly posted and questions about it are posted as well. However, we probably won't get new updates until before the stress test and after.
---
No there were zero casual playing vanilla. Everyone was fully geared rank 14.
---
Do we know if we get to choose between the new and old character models/animations? Or if it'll be all old?
---
How can something thats not even released be too late to hop on?  
---
If you think you would enjoy playing WoW, do so. Hopefully classic will breathe new life in to an already amazing game and the more we are the more fun it'll be!
---
I would say there should be some more rules implemented here, but not just ban everything stream related. I wouldn't like to see posts like ''Streamer X is going live in 5 minutes!!!11'', but if there's an actually interesting clip from a stream and someone feels the need to share it, sure why not. Doesn't really differ from sharing a youtube video. But some guidelines should probably be implemented when launch is getting closer.
---
That being said i don't envy the mods at all, this place is going to be  a mess to moderate in late august. Good luck!
---
&gt;Doesn't seem too silly to me to think I who gave blizzard 115 dollars should have a higher chance  of being selected 
---
Yes, its silly to me. For me, there is no rationale behind it. I can see why people may feel that way intially but once we think about it a little bit it just doesnt make sense. Im sorry if you see this is a personal attack and have to call me a smartass. Dont engange in reddit if u cant discuss topics objectively.
---
can you macro the "stop wand" into your key spellcast buttons?
---
Statistics are racist on Reddit. Noticing things is racist. You're probably an alt-right nazi bigot shitlord.
---
Seriously though, these people can't be reasoned with. Anytime someone comes out the gate swinging "THAT'S RACIST OMG" you can disregard them completely. Reality does not care about being politically correct and that fact will forever haunt these people.
---
It was planned in the sense that Venruki and Asmongold's chats instigated the fight.
---
You realize that you werent magically communing with every retail player at once right. Lots of people playing retail enjoy the game, but also wish it had many of the elements present in classic and are looking forward to experiencing those in classic, in many cases for the first time. It really sucks that I cant come here to enjoy classic hype without the constant shitting on anyone who likes retail, or people making half-baked complaints who refuse to accept that there might be some redeeming features or people who can legitimately enjoy it.
---
The people doing that here are just as bad as the retail players shitting on classic, even when neither group intends to play the other game
---
I honestly want TitanPanel...
---
12 days as a ret paladin, used to make fun of my friend who needed 22 days on his rogue.. We were 15 back then so everything always ended up as a competition.
---
Unfortunately i dont think blizzard will ever publish numbers of subscribers only playing classic, so we wont have any kind of objective information about that :/
---
&gt;poopsocked
---
Never heard this before, but I'm pretty sure what you mean. Hilarious.
---
Its just a druid doing what druids do....nothing impressive lol
---
Been thinking about this aswell, if this spot is reachable when it launches it’s going to be heaven for Mages later on
---
Yeah, exactly, lol.  Oh, I had another idea about melee range: When you consider that the default (I assume PC is default) hitbox radius is 0.5y and default combat reach 1.5y, then if combat reach starts from the hitbox edge, it actually makes sense melee has a 5y range measured from the center but a 3y measured from the edge because:
---
0.5y+1.5y+3y=5y from the center.  Therefore, that'd be why the devs just use 5 in the formula unless the target's combat reach is abnormal.  Taurens just add 1y no matter what, I guess.
---
There is weather in the Beta. I saw a vid where it was raining
---
From what I remember +spell damage is different from +healing done
---
But chat channels in vanilla are regional, youd still need to be in the same zone for it to work. Which would make it best used in capital cities, which in turn just makes it the same as asking for people in the city chat.
---
That is at least how those addons back in the day worked (Call to Arms) and how modern vanilla addons works in pservers (vQueue)
---
Although i appreciate the meme, it really bothers me.
---
Desite the classic community painting itself as the victim most of the time, from my experience visiting both reddit &amp; forums they are by far the most toxic ones.
---
Want an example ? Post from the EU forum : [https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/what-do-you-think-will-happen-to-retail-after-classic-launches/50288/45](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/what-do-you-think-will-happen-to-retail-after-classic-launches/50288/45) 
---
You may disagree with the posts above but there are no attacks on Classic fans, it is a peaceful discussion about how classic will hold on for the long term. At worst they think it'll only keep it's hardcore fans, at best it would grow on his own without bothering retail since both games are different enough to not canibalize on each other's playerbase. Yet the first to bring toxicity and attacks is a Classic fan. 
---
Is that the vanilla social experience ? People who can't accept neither criticism nor different opinions ? Somehow it's fine to hate BFA but saying classic will lose player in the long run is a blasphemy ?
---
Fair point, I recall reading somewhere about FFXIV that only about 2% of the overall player-base engages in regular social media activity (including official and unofficial game forums) in relation to the game. Really makes it hard for game developers to judge what their customers truly want. 
---
But there is a metric, and that is the subscriptions, sales or active-user count, which has obviously fallen to such a level where they do not wish to report on it. Though their revenue from micro-transactions has increased drastically, which indicates they are earning money mostly from a select few addicts/superfans rather than the general player.
---
I didn't call you a smartass for disagreeing with my comment, I called you one for your original response. you could say "No, money doesn't usually take into account for beta access" or something along those lines. And in your highlight you conveniently left out "... than someone who didn't" I don't think you are being "objectively" fair.
---
I'd rather it stays untouched. The same as i would feel if they started adding things to their other classic games like Diablo and WC3, etc. It's just that vanilla was never preserved like other games are, due to the nature of mmorpgs and how they're constantly updated.
---
It would be really cool though if they released new wow classic expansions though but it would be a sepatare game that you could transfer your characters over to. Just to keep wow classic intact.
---
Seems like it has the old weather. Haven't watched a lot of streams but I think I saw the old rainy weather on Staysafe's stream
---
Hopefully it’s intended, having space bar as swim up is way better
---
So you think Blizzard is not capable of banning specific addons? Are you delusional?
---
yes its a bit of a struggle to find spots in raiding guilds, some guilds even want hunters to roll an alt also to even get a spot.
---
and yes hunters scale very badly with gear, they do good dmg up until bwl after that their dmg will be one of the lowest.
---
i'd recommend u to roll a mage since you probably know that class better and they scale much better with gear!
---
you mean his "Make Azeroth Great Again" hat? LULW
---
You've never been ganked.  You've never had a group of horde constantly assaulting lakeshire or sitting outside darkshire.  Youve never had a group of on level or a single max level enemy faction sit on your corpse waiting for you to respawn to kill you again.
---
You either haven't played on any pvp server ever or are obviously the best player ever that everyone wants to ignore.
---
Hi, /u/adultpop
---
How will they ban it? Tell me how.
---
Hahah welcome to classic, level one main first.
---
YouTube used to have a length limit. First it was 10 and then 15 minutes. I can't remember when it was removed but before that most videos were only like 5 minutes long.
---
Hell no, I wanna see these awesome clips of fun shit happening in vanilla.
---
Jon "men, women and children too" Jafari
---
Wait what is this real
---
took me 20 secs to find.  
---
Not sure what you use as key words in google ?
---
I'm totally with you on that. What ever server I end up on is going to be as far away from streamers as humanly possible.
---
Hate culture. Lolk
---
I brought that up in my original comment.  Even if i try to get a counter group im still most likely dropping whatever i was doing in that zone if leveling and trying to find things elsewhere to do.
---
I got into the beta, don't even have an active sub.
---
thanks for the support. its cold. and the only thing that can warm me is wow classic beta. Kappa
---
Apparently you're not racist until lynch people nowadays
---
Jontron is racist, no two ways about it
---
The developers have also stated that the possibility for more content (that was not part of retail vanilla) is not zero. They have said that it all depends on what the community wants and how successful Classic is!
---
I don't really understand the whole "But you're just seeing it through rose tinted glasses!".
---
But.. if you're enjoying the game for 10 hours a day, does it even matter that it's nostalgia? Are people really saying "You shouldn't be enjoying this". Why?
---
Lmfao this is me multiple times a day
---
It is kind of inefficient, but you can cast it when you are about to get aggro, wand and let the mana regen kick in after five seconds. Heal gets you better health per mana but it's all up front.
---
Quite possible since a sub gives you access to both
---
&gt; you could say "No, money doesn't usually take into account for beta access"
---
Yes, youre right and i said that dozens of times in the last 6 days. I was just informing you that i cant understand the reasonal thinking behind it, implying that it shouldnt matter in any way.  
---
&gt; I don't think you are being "objectively" fair. 
---
In my mother language (german) the addition of "than someone who didn't" is heavily implied and doesnt change the sentence, im sorry for making that impression, i truly am.  
---
I also could see, depending on if its a "test me out beta" (which classic beta isnt) that money spent on product could even be a negative criteria. I could imagine companies not giving out capacities to test a game if you already bought it (or are very likely to buy it)
---
With their recent business practices, you know for a fact they are doing it on purpose. Blizzard is no longer ran by a group of guys who are filled with passion and determination to be the best. Blizzard is run by a bunch of suit and ties that are investing your money into market research so they can get more of your money. Just watch a dev interview from 8 years ago vs. present day. The passion is gone. Their employees are treated horribly and they are walking on egg shells knows they could be laid off any day now. Profit is taking a priority over quality.
---
Mobile diablo over before diablo 4? They are making that game for china and their micro transaction market. Look at the last expansions for wow. Limited content but the implementation of an rng gear system for compensation. Hearthstone heavily incentivizing the card pack shop. Heroes of the storm development being chopped at the knee caps despite having an active player base. HOTS probably wasn’t making enough money through their shop. Look at the recent sellout/partnership with Activision. 
---
Blizzard has been compromised and has fallen victim to the virus of toxic business practices of greed. Retail wow will only get worse to support classic wow because they know they will never be able to alter classic. Don’t hold your breath their future releases. Diablo, starcraft, and warcraft are no longer blizzards passion. They are money making titles. 
---
Sorry, this went longer than expected. It just kept coming.
---
There’s a small button “ex-members” on the guild page, it sometimes works, sometimes doesn’t, but worth a try.
---
I actually played EvE as well for a number of years. Solid game with some of the most dreadful moment to moment gameplay in gaming history. Small gang PvP is easily the most fun activity then and probably now. The problem was always how to fill the empty moments that weren't mind numbingly boring which is basically everything else. All PvE is dreadful with incursions probably being the best? Large fleet engagements sucked. Finding PvP engagements that were winnable sucked. Waiting a month for training to finish sucked. Harvesting tears at frequented gates were fun but still irregular enough to suck. Still loved offering people the chance to ransom themselves, getting the ransom and still podding them. Good times
---
As for Classic, they would be better off time locking Classic and opening a separate TBC time locked server. TBC was still the best version of WoW and arenas, which helped start the slide to shit, at least adds another activity for people to do
---
Pvp is the full wow experience.
---
I plan on going full out on ground clutter and shadows, but leave the rest at old school settings.
---
A LFR addon only needs access to chat and player data. How exactly is Blizzard going to limit the API to break a LFR addon without breaking just about every other addon?
---
People that think there won't be a LFR addon are delusional.
---
Why does this require spell batching?
---
Is Thrall holding Mjolnir? Never noticed that before.
---
&gt; burning crusade babies
---
Yeah. What scrubs. They have no right to talk about the good old days. They only started 13 years ago instead of 14-15 years ago. What a bunch of fucking newbies, am I right? I've never seen anyone so inexperienced about what the game was actually like.  
---
&gt; and are actually OK with flying mounts at some point.  
---
In classic? Or are you saying they *were* okay with flying mounts at some point? Because I'm pretty sure I and every single one of my friends were hyped as fuck about flying mounts when BC was announced. We were 15 years old and didn't grasp the implications about how they'd ruin world content.
---
It runs better because it's using the current game engine with proper server capacity. Vanilla pservers just use the old code.
---
Whenever I see this argument being used I am just left confused. I have never played vanilla back in the day, and I've started WoW on a Wrath private server which wasn't blizzlike. I didn't even reach max level.
---
Yet, I want to play classic way more than bfa.
---
Honestly, just pick 1 of the 4 you said you tired and don't think about it to much. You'll begin to love your class/character from the journey you've experienced with him. It's more then just a rotation in a raid or your role in a BG. Just enjoy the experience its all the same.
---
A LFR addon really only needs access to chat and player data. To break that, you'd have to break just about every other addon.
---
Was there currency’s back in classic such as Valor / honor or anything
---
Oh, another idea: Medium Range is 10-30 and Long Range is 10-40.  Is it at all possible the devs for Classic mistakenly used that entry instead for Hunters?  But then I have a feeling Hawk Eye talent wouldn't work at all...and how could they possibly make such a ridiculous mistake?
---
Still, that min range in the video looks JUST like 10y to me.
---
I'm not sure if this is common knowledge since they are using the new mail system, but you can see where your mail comes from (who sent it) if you hover over the mail icon.  
---
I'm fairly sure it only said "You have unread mail" before, I don't have anything against this change, it's just something I noticed while watching a stream today :)
---
That's definitely not happening now.
---
&gt; 1) will it be a struggle to find a core position for raiding(early&gt;mid&gt;late game)?
---
It depends, usually you always want atleast 2 good hunters in a raid, so if you're one of them, good for you, otherwise it may be hard to get into an ultra-high end group/tryhard guild
---
&gt; 2) Does hunter scaling really suck as much as everyone claims it to be? Will I be able to hold my own (PvP wise) mid/late game? I know they are beasts early on.
---
Hunter scaling only really shows their weakness in late AQ/Naxx because the warriors/rogue/mages starts to pop off with all the gear. In PvP hunters are always good, regardless of tier.
---
That's not a retail thing per se, but rather a moronic-casual (because there are actually casuals that don't want it) opinion that has caused all of the titanforging shit and world quests giving heroic raid gear.
---
Yeah I can feel your pain! God damn let me play:)
---
I wouldnt worry about it, maybe it will figure itself out. Like, maybe, after a time, you start prefering one char :x
---
It is a good thing that beta is exclusive. It lets those that aren't in see what the game has to offer before jumping in and seeing how slow it is to start. But for instance the Battle for Arathi today is a prime example why this game will be hyped more and more if not everyone is let into the game
---
Lol thanks. Yea I’ve gotten both classes to high levels on vanilla. Idk I might take this advice. Prolly roll the most committed class first. Then roll a less... useful? class afterwards
---
Short and long answer is both yes, lol
---
Up to what point can you heal dungeons as Ret? 
---
Also, the only other class I was considering was Hunter but i'm worried about finding groups. I don't know if you've spent much time on Private, but is this generally a problem?
---
Welcome to the crippling depression club my guy
---
It's actually a bit early. I would wait till classic release\^\^
---
Hi, /u/misterrpg
---
Fuck no. They don't wanna wade through tens of thousands of repeat/false reports and I don't blame them.
---
If you're looking for an objective unbiased poll, you won't find it here. None of them will paint an accurate picture of whats going to happen on live servers for a couple reasons.
---
All the people answering these polls are from this subreddit; people will roll Warriors and quit because its hard, its how its always been;  polls and opinions change how people respond to other future polls, ie "I'm not gonna pick Mage cause it seem popular so I'm gonna vote Warlock" or "I'm not going to pick Druid cause /r/ClassicWoW says they suck".
---
Point is, take all the polls with a grain of salt.
---
&gt; Transmog absolutely does affect gameplay and has no place in classic
---
Please tell how you think it affects the gameplay?
---
Oh it was fun. It was the highlight of all my WoW experiences
---
Someone just give this person beta please, it will be reward enough for the effort!!! Great work!
---
Pls rais_AutoShot :F
---
&gt;, I tuned in a few times on twitch to see him in the red cap and got kinda put off. 
---
Did a hat hurt your feelings?
---
Can't wait ignore every streamer server
---
Have you not read about layers? What you have said is not true. There will be different layers of the same server at first.
---
Waiting.
---
Nothing like that.
---
Or you could read it to me while I'm playing games. While you're playing with me. While you're giving me a bj. All for free. That'd be nice too
---
Just play the game! To many people are rushing, this is not the classic wow feeling we want. Enjoy the ride and start it again when your are max lvl, so you can choose to raid or lvl your alt.

Most gaming publications gave it a score of 9/10 or 90% and above.

Yup, I had that issue. Mainly because I get bored with one class at some point so I'll play another class to keep the interest going.
---
The release date is totally fucked (for me atleast). I have 8 weeks of vacation, and classic will be released 2 weeks after my vacation is over.... FML
---
Hovering over party member markers while viewing the map, then closing the map seems to leave the nameplate next to your mouse after the map is closed.  Clip from StaySafe's stream: https://clips.twitch.tv/JoyousImpossibleSwordPupper
---
Name plate persists until he moved his mouse over his action bar.  Can anyone with beta access attempt to recreate it?
---
Late 2005, I get a phone call at 2am from unknown number from Sweden: "Wake up, dragons spawned". A classic indeed.
---
You do you! :)
---
Personally i will avoid the one class i already played on a privateserver up to BWL :)
---
Please tell us how you think they will "destroy vanilla"?
---
People on private servers have been using them for over a decade and people in the original Vanilla were using them.
---
Heck, one-button-rotation macros and decursive (before it got broken by blizz) were far more "destroying Vanilla".
---
Me and a bunch of friends started a WoW discord and are planning classes, roles, server etc
---
Yea I wish I had abstained from vanilla activities, but I guess I’ll just stick with what works.
---
Bfa bad gimme upvotes
---
I would say if you really wanted you could bring 4 of spec shamans one feral and one shadow. That will give you a shaman in every group and you get enhancement shamans to totem twist. I'll never play twisting shaman again tho, it is mind numbing boring and you have to be 100% on point whole bossfight you do less damage then tank and you can cost the raid tons if you screw up  the more fun part is that this might actually be better looking at the whole raids damage/healing/mitigation. Would love to se some maths on what dps benefits does a shaman give to the raid group in different specs/playing differently
---
I'd totally agree with that. If the melee is 5 yds, it definitely feels like 10 yards then. If you look at the pictures but instead assume min range is incorrectly 10 yards... It would be exactly as you say and 5 yards would be halfway (from center of target at least)
---
You might be on to something there!
---
10 yards is 9.14 meters
---
Quin69 on twitch.  Check out the VID of his first classic beta stream, it’s pretty hilarious how he’s running around looking for the auction house for 10 minutes
---
Asmon... gold. lol
---
Day/night cycle based on server time is back?!? YYYEEESSS!!!
---
I feel ya, but it’s just not worth the 10% chance. They don’t deserve the money either - yes the classic team look like they might actually be decent devs, but blizzard as a company has become a rotting corpse.
---
Keep in mind that people have been playing since Vanilla on private servers and still continue to play to this day.
---
No, that type of thing was introduced with BC. But they were badges
---
Also in regards to this, it does seem max range is a little bit off... I saw a priest healing someone from what looked to be 40+ yards away

[Dual wield?](https://i.redd.it/wk0ghf9cvp421.png)
---
I've played hunter in vanilla myself and later as main character up to panda candy expansion :P 
---
I also had a blast in pvp (I'm pvp focused :P ) 
---
I asked wrong question I guess hehe :) ... what I wanted to ask is do you have same feeling playing hunter in beta as you had in vanilla years ago ? :)
---
Obviously I do like that there is an active community around classic. And you are, in my opinion right about the fact that there is limited things to post at the moment.  
---
I'm not that excited about the numerous post on *What class should I play?*, *Should I play Classic?* either. Those are in my opinion more meaningless that the clips of Asmon, Soda or any other streamer getting "jebaited" or having some random green drop. Again I'm not saying that there should be a ban posting these threads, but I hope that things will tone down. Maybe it will when we get to stress testing phases.
---
for me everytime, after some time there comes a point where the current quests/dungeons are not so much fun and i rather level an alt for a bit. also if you play on a pvp server its completely possible that you get ganked at your current quest hub, repeatedly, for hours, your broken body spammed with /spit emotes. thats when i take a breath and switch to my alt for some unhindered leveling.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Kenco%27s_research_on_threat
---
Unmodified healing threat is 0.5 per healing done (overhealing doesn't generate threat). He is not doing anything to the mob and getting healed like crazy. He should instantly lose threat to the healer if threat worked like in vanilla.
---
Probably druid will be least played, but they are very fun. Highly recommend the class myself.
---
Server uptime is no factor at all anymore these days. I was part of a pserver team and servers with 3k+ players had 5-10 days uptime without any issues.
---
[So someone already made a LFR addon..](https://github.com/insaneKane/wow-classic-lfg-lfr) I hope Blizzard breaks/bans these kind of addons.
---
I'd honestly do research into classes, because there's a pretty big commitment for you to hit 60 and it sucks if you choose something you end up not liking because of what the class plays like at 60.
---
Yep you can see the effect of the fallen player base first hand, i've changed guilds several times over the years simply because entire raiding teams just slowly lose their core members, people who've raided together for years and others lose motivation and leave.
---
I've got like a hundred people on skype that i've played WoW with over the years, and met some in IRL for guild meetings and maybe 2 still play it's pretty insane.
---
I'm very hopeful for Classic, it's made some of those people reach out again and we're talking about forming a guild. I would love for them to report on it's success too, i've always wondered what it is now and it'd be nice to know what it becomes.
---
They absolutely should! Its just that most of the big streamers have been dicking around most of the time in the beta. So it was nice something productive for once! xD
---
That dude is a racist
---
So the dungeon guide, I'm contemplating to buy it somewhere, is it any good? Nice collection!
---
I’m building a gaming room in my shed under the guise of it being an office. But it will be decorated in the colours of the horde and also be where I can be found every day for 3 weeks after the release.
---
Agree on that :)
---
I can't wait!
---
&gt; Make it so the addon doesn't work? Unlikely.
---
Why is that unlikely?
---
great work! really appreciate it.
---
sadly there is no coordinates. i think that would help a lot. if you are willing to do a revision or whatever, thats one of the things you should aim for!
---
Yeh, of course I watch soda, I don't like seeing random posts like where he kills an elite or something, but I find him entertaining. Seeing random posts about streamers doing something dumb in the game isnt as entertaining as the pvp content that happened yesterday. So maybe limitations but not entirely NO STREAMER POSTS. I'm definitely looking forward to more blue posts about "this was not a bug" and "this was a fixed bug that was found in beta" and more information about waves being sent out and what not too :D.
---
I've recently begun playing Retail, and I enjoy the grind quite a lot. It's not the same as Vanilla, and it shouldn't be. They have improved the game on so many different levels, in the amount of content etc. etc. It is literally unending. I see myself going back and doing stuff in Draenor and Legion I hadn't before.
---
With that said, I am personally looking forward to play Classic, as I know I will enjoy the game with some heavy rose-tinted glasses. Will it all be good? For sure no. But I hope I can enjoy the grind and play with new and old friends...
---
You need to gtfo if you would use the WOD models
---
This should do fine, the RX570 should not struggle with this game, but the i3 might be a bottleneck (i am unsure tho, and it will probably suffice).
---
on private servers at least, these kinds of issues indicate that server itself is stressed/lags
---
Twitch clips have literraly been broken for me on mobile for well over a year. They just buffer every 2 seconds. Anyone else?
---
Well, he did realize what was going on. Very first thing he did was mouseover Esfand to check his buffs. Fortunately, the potion had already run out. 
---
I'm pretty sure I would have been totally confused.
---
Don't think they've given out exact info, apart from people guessing how they're handling it
---
Thats how you troll, that was hilarious lol +1
---
There are people against this?
---
Yeh fuck that guy for wanting updated graphics that have literally ZERO negative effect on anyone.
---
I am a simple man. I see kotaku, I downvote
---
hahahahahha i had no idea what i was doing :D was just a lil kiddo running around in azeroth
---
I'm maining a priest, so I made an excel file with my wand progression and talents at 30,45,57 for Shadow and 57+ for Holy.
---
Also mt BiS gear list with alternatives for my 19 twink.
---
The animations are the old ones, none of the new ones are in the game.  Rogue stealth is the only updated animation I know of and it's being reported.
---
There's no option to choose animations of any sort.
---
The SW fountain!! If I can't afk there I will be super disappointed.
---
Forgetting about atiesh smh
---
Not really, no.
---
1. Yes most certainly.
---
2. Propably more than enough to fill at least one server.
---
3. I wouldn't go in completely blind. It'd be good to know what the classes are capable of in pve and pvp and what their roles are and especially how  much time and effort they require to use their full potential.
---
4. I'd say the most important thing to know is that everything you do will take time and that patience is key. Leveling to 60, finding groups, farming gold, ranking up, completing raids, getting the best items, moving around the world. Theres almost nothing that gives you instant rewards. You really need to put in some "work" but thats what makes the game great.
---
5. Depends on what you want to do of course. I wouldnt pick warrior as a new player because they require the most effort, time and knowledge to really make them work. Two classes that stand out for me are hunter and warlock. They are easy to level, really good in pvp and what is unique to those classes is that they can basically use the same spec to do really well in both pvp and pve. Other classes have to respec twice every week (=100gold) if you want to get the most out of them in both game aspects.
---
I didn't personally play vanilla, I was a late-bc/wrath baby, but a lot of the things I remember from back then held true for the time I played in BC. I had a basic account with no expacs so I ended up doing all of vanilla content anyways, with a bunch of other 60s. As well as spending the last year or so on pservers trying to recapture those moments.  
---
Unfortunately I haven't been able to play the beta and probably won't, because I find it silly to sub just for the "chance" at a beta. If I was already subbed then cool, but I haven't been subbed since end of Mists. The clip from the beta was provided by a streamer who kindly let me tell him what to do :P
---
You yearn for a "fun" PvP experience. It's unlikely you'll get that. "World PvP" is basically ganking, now more than ever. Roll the dice and hope it's not that or not, you decide.
---
If we are a bit more charitable, I'd say that if you are fine with other people dictating your game play experience, roll PvP. If you rather played on your terms, roll PvE.
---
talk about a leap, yikes.
---
I can't say that I mind them. The facial animations look a little goofy, but apart from that I'd say they're solid. The vanilla wow 'aesthetic' doesn't matter much to me, mainly the setting (I kinda like just being a random dude as opposed to fucking Daenerys with 10.000 titles) and the gameplay.
---
He can hide all the menus he want, people will just go through all the servers and search his name until he finds the correct character, then it will be public knowledge instantly, the sercret of what server he is on will not hold for more than 1 hour on launch (if even that)
---
yeah, people played WoW on 4:3 back then. 1280x1024 resolution.
---
I'm gonna fire up WoW in 2560x1080 resolution. For the first time, I'll actually see the game instead of the UI!
---
&gt; Sharding 2.0 needs to be invisible to players, period.
---
Go play BFA if you want sharding at all. The only form of sharding I'll accept is absolutely none.
---
But dual wield was added in TBC and Herod's Shoulder became plate in like 2016 or so. [X](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/023/021/e02e5ffb5f980cd8262cf7f0ae00a4a9_press-x-to-doubt-memes-memesuper-la-noire-doubt-meme_419-238.png)
---
^This pretty much. If anything, the payback they are getting now is mild if anything.
---
for a proper PVP player, being salty is part of the fun. I don't know Asmongold though, is he one of those?
---
Correct, but the stat in particular I'm talking about is "increased damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to X", like you see on the Judgement set.
---
I know that feeling from when one of my main games got a classic server. It's just a great feeling to play with your old friends again. I hope you and your friends have a great time.
---
It depends on if they end up fixing though. Anyone remember the BFA beta? Yeah everyone also said "Don't worry, it's just the beta", but it wasn't just the beta. Anyway, I hope this is simple enough to fix, it seems like a pretty big flaw.
---
Just fucking play what you want, jesus. 
---
First its people who say "I really want to play X class, but its really bad so i dont know if i want to.."
---
now its "I really want to play X class, but its really good so i dont know if i want to.."
---
just fucking play what you want.
---
Comments like this is what made retail what it is today. I mean yea It can be good but little things like this piling up made retail the shitty game it is today.
---
streamers have many resources available to them with their streaming software. they already can cover chat with things like stream chat or a face cam. all they have to do is put a black box over where the server name appears and when they choose their realm do it with the screen blocked. regardless, they won't last long. blizzard already said they might add an armory for classic which will make hiding impossible.
---
"Oh I can take this mage, his gear sucks"  
---
Jk it was tier 3 transmogged to look like dungeon blues. Obviously an extreme example but glance value matters a lot in pvp and in MMOs in general
---
The procs always get 0 benefit from spell power.  Certain buffs or enemy debuffs, like percent modifiers can alter those procs, but no baseline stats alter them.  There are some bugged private servers, but in vanilla spell power only affects spells by design.  
---
If you have engr and are going for a reflective shockadin sorta build I would suggest force reactive disk or even drillborer over skullflame.  Skullflame is really terrible, but is always expensive because people buy it for the looks. 
---
IIRC SoR did not hit twice on extra swings for hand of justice, but supposedly(i never personally sat and tested it) SoR hits were capable of procing as if it was an attack itself.  So you didn't get SoR off of hand, but you could proc an extra swing off of SoR.  This made fiery weapon quite good, and I think weapons that have a built in proc somewhat useful.  
---
Alot of shockadin builds go 20 ret, and get SoC.  Even though it doesn't do more damage with a fast 1h, the judgement does double damage on stunned targets, and crit for x2 modifier, instead of JoR's 1.5 crit modifier.
---
There's a demographic factor here. For the 25+ years old ?  There's good chance that happens. For the youger playerbase I don't think so.
---
I'm a good decade older than other gamers at work or my guildies on FF14, and most of them can't conceive why LFG/LFR not here, or why the quest's objectives missing on the map. They don't like reading explanations, or having to search something, or in general any situation in leveling where they don't actively have to press something on the actionbar. And yet once at max level they will camp for hours for a rare spawn that drops a mount.
---
Pretty impressive considering shamans couldn't dual wield in vanilla.
---
How is this unpopular? Arena ruined PvP for the many by catering to the few. It also introduced all the class balancing and homogeneity since everything had to be balanced around 2v2 and 3v3, whereas they used to balance around 10 v 10.
---
Arena would be fine as long as Blizz made ZERO attempt to ever balance it
---
It's a beta, no one care about being efficient. Also Esfand is quite knowledgeable and tries to find bugs, you can't deny that.
---
I would guess a little better, but dont get your hopes up to much, you will probably not reach 60 fps, but maybe 30, with substancial drops in cities and maybe raids.
---
Rogue isn't considered an op class in vanilla, no. It's just a regular plain average class. It was only considered op when most people were clicking and keyboard turning and people thought invisibility was hax.
---
Is running a staff on a warrior decent at all? Would it be acceptable to choose the staff over the legs from the deadmines quest reward?  [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=166](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=166)
---
This would be the one reason I'd be fine with playing on a streamer server, as long as there are 2 just as big streamers on both sides. 
---
But it's not needed if Blizzard just release RP-PvP servers, since it'll be a regular community event instead of streamer event ^^,
---
I only made it to 58 on my go to class so there’s a lot to experience still. I think the choice is clear :0
---
Miss chance should be 53%, dodge 10%, parry 10%.
---
Yes
---
This place is such a hivemind, OP is comparing apples to oranges. Of course the 1-20 experience is going to be worse in retail. That is quite literally not even 0.1% of the retail wow experience. 1-20 in vanilla wow was some people’s only experience of the game, it took me 5 days played to get to level 24 on my first character because I went exploring and wanted to level professions and shit. 
---
Honestly, when are people going to learn that these posts that rag in retail are only negative for classic? Retail is flawed in so many ways you could write a novel on them, but at least try and make the complaints valid....
---
This should be pinned.
---
Thank you
---
Warfronts are pve against terrible AI 
---
Can't really compare
---
Plenty of them exist. Whether we're speaking about the infamous wall of no or years of people policing the forums. There's even streamers (one of which specifically smeared the demo) that have tried to paint it in a negative light. I'm not particularly in to tribalism but you're living under a rock if you think vanilla players haven't gotten a lot of hate from retail.
---
That’s a great idea! I’ll keep my alt on the side for those annoying hillsbrad moments! Also pursuing world pvp alone could be fun at the start of the server
---
That's my take with him as well, the majority of the time it's super obvious to me that he is either trolling or acting (or both), to bait stuff like chat reactions or maybe also donations.
---
I guess it COULD be hard to see for some people, maybe if they don't watch him too much. Or these people just don't get it.
---
No idea, but all these people here that are complaining etc. are comical to me.
---
nah it's more than just server choice. He was getting really cocky when he was doing dungeons and saying how classic was a joke and was super easy, and in some sense belittling classic fans.
---
And then he goes on to wipe twice in BFD lol
---
Roll Hunter :P
---
- raid spots are hard to find only if you aim to be in elite hardcore min/max endgame guild ... I played hunter vanilla - panda and I was PvP player ... I was usually in guest spot in friendly pve guild ... I never had a problem ... they knew I was reliable
---
- (I will write this in caps because it is important) ... DMG IN PVE:
---
1-59 RAIDS = GREAT, SOMETIMES TOP DPS
---
60 EARLY = GREAT, SOMETIMES TOP DPS
---
60 MID = GOOD, YOU STILL CAN COMPETE WITH OTHERS FOR TOP
---
60 END GAME = MEDIUM, FOR HARDCORE MIN/MAX GUILD STANDARDS 
---
DMG IN PVP:
---
1-59 PVP = MMMMOOONNNSSTTTEEERRRRR
---
60 EARLY PVP = MMMMOOONNNSSTTTEEERRRR
---
60 MID PVP = GREAT
---
60 END GAME PVP = GREAT 
---
To help you answer your question ... as a mage did you sometimes find hunter that is really hard to fight against ? If yes this is good player hunter and you can see how hunter can use his utility kit 
---
Statement: everyone in pvp has access to engineering ... I would say hunter benefits most from it ... he scales with engineering best
---
Is there a viable method of leveling a mage in the nightelf starting area to grind the rep? In regards to trainiers/skills
---
It's not. Probably in some baby expansion which removed threat as mechanic and whoever got initial aggro cannot lose it.
---
What is it with people wanting things the don’t like banned or removed? It was the pandering to this kind of attitude that ruined the modern game.
---
There is a lot of irony in us - the people who advocated for the old back - discussing the finer points of stripping “features” out of our subreddit.

If you don’t like said type of post, press the down button, comment your displeasure and move on. Banning and removing things you don’t like usually leaves a sour taste in the mouths of everyone else.

Yes! Weapon swing timer

You will never want if you plan on raid healing as a druid. Druids are easily the least played class
---
They can block whatever box they want, aslong as they show their game, people will find out when they have found the right server, its only a matter of time, im sure people will find out within an hour (or even less).
---
I'm still running bfa over 100 fps on a 9 year old i7 and a gtx 760 so you should be fine
---
it's amazing how far tipsout rep has dropped since the beta came out.  He's getting a shit ton of views and blowing up on youtube though
---
There are 2 gigantic streamers; Asmongold and Soda. You can avoid them, and there is the potential that they'll both be on the same server. But there are tons of 1-4k streamers that will pepper every server.
---
Streamers are unavoidable, especially if there are only going to be like 20-30 servers. So yeah, you can avoid those two but you can't avoid it in general.
---
Who would've thought asmon would be like that on classic. /s
---
please make more !
---
Classic is rewarding in so many ways
---
Watching the streamers getting extremely excited when they get new gear make me feel emotional. This is because it is not common to come across good gear
---
I want to play classic so badly
---
I usually like to play "bad" classes/characters in games. If you've ever played Final Fantasy I as a Thief you'd know what I'm talking about.
---
I have no idea about dual wield but for the shoulders they are plate because the change happened while my character had them equipped  from vanilla when they were mail. I dont get where you want this to go with your comment really :p

---
Thanks. Do you know if the +11 Spirit makes any difference at that level?
---
There is no tool in the holy tree that you need for healing a dungeon.  All of the benefit is replacable with gear.  12% healing, 10% int, mp/5 from imp wisdom, crit from holy power, and effective regen from illumination.  
---
So if you outgear a dungeon, your tank does, or you just play very well, you don't ever need to be holy for dungeons.
---
Hunter is ok at finding groups, but any healer or tank is x2 or more easier to find a group.  
---
My first character was a priest, I got tired of playing shadow so I respecced and leveled from 35 to about 50 by just spamming dungeons.  It was slower then questing, but I learned a lot and it was fun.  
---
Respec costs are something to be aware of so you don't end up broke and in the wrong spec, but they are no so bad that you can't respec a few times while leveling ot get a feel for the other specs.
---
Lol if anything world pvp should give zero honor. Gank all you want but it should be its own reward.
---
You can heal every dungeon that is not a raid with a dps spec if you bring the right gear and maybe some mana potions. Getting into groups as a hunter might take a while if youre unlucky but its not too bad. You might want to start your own groups sometimes to speed things up.
---
Every raid needed at least one hunter, usually 3-4 to be safe. Will you be top of DPS meters? No, never, but you’re considering that or a mage, so you don’t really care anyway.
---
You care about PVP, so one thing to consider is respecting costs. Hunters could be just about any spec in raids. They were needed for tranq shot. Mages with a PVP spec were gimping themselves in raids and since their purpose was solely DPS, that wasn’t okay for a lot of progression fights. Do you really want to spend 100g per day just so you can raid at the most efficient level and PVP at the most efficient level?
---
If it were my preference, I’d go mage, but I also only started playing mage in TBC when there were a lot of balance and QoL improvements.

If you're rolling a PvE server you're just robbing yourself honestly
---
I still think there's too much foliage
---
i look forward to it alliance skum!  &lt;3
---
Judging by the  vehement attitudes of official forums and mmo-champ fellows, the die-hard Blizz/BfA loyalists will never play classic. However classic could attract a new audience, more receptive to actually figuring things out, I mean that was the main draw of the MMO "Secret World". In a similar vein I  recall people saying free-for-all non-consensual mass PvP will never be popular, but then we had Survival PVP craze for games like Conan and Ark become popular and more recently the Battle Royale Craze.
---
Every raid had a need for tranq shot. Hunters always had a spot in raids.
---
Yea my research has told me that it's possible. I just wanted to make sure there isnt too much of a difference come classic. Thanks for the input. 
---
Also I'm not trying to get the unarmored ones so I'm good there too =)
---
Ahh, much better.
---
Sounds good thanks!
---
Yes. Warfronts aren't even PvP. Even BFA babies hate warfronts.
---
I know this is a meme but holy shit warfronts have to be the absolute worst thing blizzard has ever created.
---
&gt; shouldn't of been
---
Do you even english, bro?
---
roll PvE server m8
---
Because most people who claim to have an interest in something are usually really out of the loop.
---
Ain't no way it's even a 10% either
---
You've come to the wrong neighberhood madafk. That's one of the top reasons why vanilla is epic. The talent reeee
---
I wouldn't be shocked if they actually put resources into fixing it now because its Classic WoW, and its a huge change from how Hunters and Warlocks are supposed to be. The Classic community is full of a bunch of people who want the best for the game and enough people who are just constantly sharpening their pitchforks ready to right another NOCHANGES essay.
---
Because a LFR addon doesn’t need obscure API calls. It needs access to chat and access to your player data. To break the functionality of a LFR addon, Blizzard would have to break the functionality of every addon that needs access to chat and/or access to player data. That’s pretty much every addon.

Not really, if you look at Joanna's original speedrunning video's the mobs are consistently hitting harder.
---
We'll be using a pretty modern client. FPS won't jump from 200 to 20 - that's barely a client issue but something horribly wrong with driver setups. Noone needs 200fps either way. Any FPS higher than your monitors refresh rate is questionable either way. Would make much more sense to lock your FPS to 60/100/144 - whatever your display is outputting. Would make things more stable as well ;)
---
No actually seems like everyone was pretty happy until you came in
---
You should definitely chose the staff over the pants. Low weapon speed (3.5 is better than 2.5 etc) is the key to a warrior's damage.
---
damn those memories of parkouring the church.
---
Ah I see, thanks for the info. I never played vanilla so the only info I had to go off of was the private servers, which are not suppose to be incredibly reliable.
---
I have a dilemma aswell..
---
I really like the paladin playstyle but I also prefer to DPS over everything else.
---
Also I have the feeling I won't have enough time to invest into Ret that I will do "acceptable" damage.
---
So yeah.. now I'm torn between Paladin and rogue :( haha
---
PvE servers give honor from world pvp too.
---
It has no answer yet, so it really is a good one
---
Joining a casual raiding guild that raids twice a week will be your best option.
---
it's the same thing with people wanting Blizzard to quarantine streamers all to one server and make rules so the streamers don't "ruin the classic experience!11!1" and how they're all about "#nO cHaNgeS" and whatever other asinine excuses they have.
---
I did this as well in classic. There were some night elf ruins up there and even had a little...  marble, beam thing, like "walk the plank" sticking a bit out over felwood. It was almost like it was made to encourage jumping down to felwood.  
---
I played a mage back then. Put up slow fall and jumped. Landed pretty deep into darkshore. Pretty sure I didn't have many feathers so I ended up having to give my buddies slow fall while I opted to fall and blink or just ice block.
---
Any info on if the realms will be region-based or country-based?
---
the drama created whenever he gets camped, would make his stream even more popular
---
Forget anything other than healing. There's not even the old shockadin approach (i.e. a more offensive holy approach).
---
On August 13th for US, we will be allowed to reserve names. Anyone know how will that work and when will we be allowed to reserve names in EU?
---
Shrouds playing in sonydigitals + venruki + those other guys guild. I find it unlikely they go there but I could be wrong
---
I know, you dont seem to understand what i mean. It looks like you dont enjoy being ganked, then roll PvE server if you dont enjoy World PvP and its rewardstructure.
---
Nah. You regen pretty quickly, and if you need any further healing, you have to rely on food and first aid. Spirit won't make a noticable difference.

I’m not talking about gaking though. If you kill a player with a grey level you shouldn’t get honor.
---
He's confirmed that he's going horde though, cause his friend wants to play ele sham
---
Some things will actually be more correct on private servers. ingame API used and Macro building for example. That being said, blizzard do have good reasons to change this due to how open and forgiving the API was back then, basically allowing entirely automated DPS rotations by way of script etc.
---
I mean having 1 streamer on 60k viewers leading or having 3 streamers at less than 10k each doesn't put the former at a disadvantage. 
---
If anything Alliance having a central leadership is a bigger advantage than numbers (Horde had just under 2 raids, Alliance had roughly the same or more) plus Asmon had as much prep time as he wanted to gather a bigger force, which was his whole plan.
---
It was fun as hell to watch, but the reason Asmon lost is purely because he lost. He arguably lost the numbers game and couldn't gather a big enough force, but he also got outplayed and out-manoeuvred
---
Heres the same comparison only using the centerish of the hitbox, and 10 yards... for fun:  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/JNcoN0y](https://imgur.com/a/JNcoN0y)  min range  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/95r3LwR](https://imgur.com/a/95r3LwR)  max melee  
---
This seems like a more plausible explanation, at least to an extent. It's not an exact science... Maybe there is some range check in BFA that can be used in classic?
---
Can anyone post any more screenshots of their game using the updated graphics, merely out of curiosity?
---
A good ret pala beats rogue 9/10 in pvp. Not sure how they are for pve content in classic though as i played horde
---
Why care if the class you enjoy playing is OP or not? Play whatever class you want and have a great time.
---
Until warriors got AQ gear, rogues were always the top of the DPS charts, no other class could touch them. Rogues also had an obvious advantage in world PVP. But I wouldn’t consider rogues the most overpowered class in end-game Vanilla, that title definitely goes to warriors. They were the only viable tanks, the best DPS after BWL, and held their own against any class in PVP.
---
Somehow its a 14 yr old game is more responsive and smoother, and more in depth.
---
Its quite sad that retail cant be "fixed" due to its inflation of everything, Im kind of hoping we get a WoW2 in the future due to Classic

---
You're not wrong, but atleast it's something. I can't find a game that suits me and classic private servers were literally the only thing. Now I just can't wait for classic to release.
---
Spell batching applies to spells only, they have wrongly implemented it to apply to everything. The tick that checks for fall damage should not, and was not, spell batched.
---
Yes thats phasing between zones and not sharding within the same zone. Its a HUGE difference.
---
Death is certain. Time is not.
---
Im planning on rolling a shaman and will most likely end up playing resto when 60. My brothers are gonna play hunter and mage which a
---
Cheers and returned
---
That thing made me /spit in my mind.
---
Basically you’re lying that it’s a vanilla character you recovered since you are dual wielding
---
Naxx is wotlk content. Lots of ppl experienced it.
---
The big difference is that you are rewarded for world pvp in BFA. It's actually probably one of the best parts of the expansion.
---
Spirit best stat for levelling warrior
---
if they didn't bother to fix it for 3 years it's safe to assume they simply don't care and won't fix it for classic either. So being dissapointed is definitely warranted.
---
Take mine
---
Layering is going to make the zerg a non-issue. You won’t have any problems leveling in your starting zone and meeting your friend in the Barrens.
---
Don’t send him dick pics
---
Ofcourse there are, if you've been following Classic you'd see how many ppl want things to be exactly as they were in Classic. We had no high resolution shadows, no ambient occlusion/HBAO+, no physics based moving grass back then. Some people are really against such modern additions to the game, saying at that point it's no longer the old game anymore. Some people are unsure about it, saying "where do you draw the line, then?". Some guys also want modern character models/animations too if modern graphics are allowed for Classic anyway. There's also a big discussions about the modern water - since the modern one is transparent, old one as not - in vanilla you could hide under water and noone would see you, with the modern water you see through it.
---
Im not a shaman expert so im not gonna comment on anything but this:
---
&gt; Maybe i'm just completely wrong and delusional and pve dps shamans are really meme specs after all...
---
Play what you want, not what other people tell you what not to play. If you struggle to get into groups, play with friends or join a guild. Dont let other people decide what you have fun with. You go shaman caster dps!
---
The reason I'm excited for it is because it won't be as addictive as arena PVP. I haven't played since MoP but I had to stop as the grind for PVP gear and Gladiator, every single season, took too much out of my life. Classic will give me my PVP fix but will be more casual/me friendly.
---
TFT is WOTLK AFAIK.. or is it that TFT ends with Arthas assuming the throne and the game ends and WOTLK starts from there?
---
then TBC would be the last canon story
---
i hate how warcraft story since then was tailored to revolve around the gameplay mechanics:  
---
CATACLYSM  - lets revamp the old zones so people are less bored.. how do we do it... lets have some very strong bad guy mess up the world in 10 minutes
---
PANDALAND - lets add a new playable race that didnt even have NPCs before - lets do pandas!! we may even earn money from chinese players since they love pandas  
---
WOD - we finally have no idea what to do with this game or what content to create for it... lets just make TBC 2.0
---
LEGION - TBC 2.0 worked, lets make TBC 3.0
---
BFA - this copying and rehashing of old things is really nice and easy... lets do now Vanilla 2.0
---
Wasn't sure if this is an insult or not until I read his name xD
---
Overall priests are slightly more needed on horde then alliance, but priest is still basically the most sought after class on both factions.  
---
Because of the paladin/shaman difference between factions it 
---
impacts the way different classes play.  
---
For priest in dungeons it doesnt change much at all.  
---
In raids, on horde you will be the only dispeller, and there are several fights where it is easy to wipe to lack of dispellers.  Horde has a minimum number of priests they can bring accordingly.  Shaman are quite capable aoe healers with chain heal, so priests are typically more spot healers or tank healers on alliance.  Regen work differently.  On horde you will get mana tide from a shaman, and sometimes raids will swap shamans in groups so you get multiple healing tides.  
---
On alliance paladins are straight better at cleansing, so priest are more supplementary.  Paladins are quite good spot and tank healers, but complete lack aoe heals, so on aoe fights that is more of your priority.  Instead of mana tide for regen, you'll get blessing of wisdom, blessing of kings, and judgement of wisdom.  Kings increases your spirit and int which is quite noticable, and judgement of wisdom allows you to actively regenerate mana by hitting a boss with your wand.  
---
In pvp on horde being the only dispeller makes you a prime target for both damage and CC.  Shamans can and do offheal, but their support utility to help you is quite limited.  So horde priest is expected to play a more defensive position, focusing on removing enemy magic effects and healing in between.  
---
On alliance paladins carry some more of the healing and dispelling burden making you less of a prime target, and when you are targeted the paladin can support you better, it is not all good news as horde has more offensive tools.  Shamans can break your psychic scream, and many horde pvp players will be undead to break fears as well.  Shaman can also add more offensive support by interupting your casts or purging off your buffs.  Alliance priests are expected to be more offensive support, mostly purging and healing only when the paladin is overwhelmed.
---
Soda said that's exactly the plan.
---
Who said they need to disable any api?
---
Same feels here bruuh!
---
Layering doesn’t affect anything... still 3000 players in a single server..
---
Private servers use the 1.12.1 API. Classic uses Legion API.
---
So in a sense, private servers are more true to the source material there than blizzards own classic creation.
---
I’m going to bed with my kid at 7:30 and go back up 15 minutes early. No discussion with my wife.
---
Use the advantage of being an adult. Don’t exchange the suppression by your parents with being suppressed by your wife/girl.
---
Everyone has the right to be happy. Maybe tell her to get a hobby by herself or maybe buy her a horse or something...
---
&gt; LK
---
WotLK ruined PvP. It got WoW arenas delisted from MLG. TSG was too cancerous since DKs were OP as fuck.  
---
MoP saw the rise of Fire mages getting R1 glad (Hansol). For that, I'll always love MoP PVP.
---
Decursive..... For ... I think boss 2? in MC.... God that was amazing.
---
I like Esfan a lot, but if I have to hear "ON PRIVATE SERVERS IT WAS" one more time I'm gonna blow my brains out lol
---
&gt; Then again, I don’t know how it was in vanilla, so who knows.
---
it wasn't used at all. it's entirely a private server gimmick. if, for some reason, it *does* work. it should be changed.
---
Who's doubled down?
---
I'd say the majority would be happy to change their mind if they end up liking it - I mean why wouldn't you?
---
There was a thread earlier. Apparently it's a 8.something client, just before they added multi core support and directx 12.
---
PvE server has same reward structure, so your advice is still useless and irrelevant. I said world pvp should not give rewards. This is because world pvp rewards only cause farming, not the good kind of world pvp which already happens without any rewards.
---
I think it's just very basic psychology. You stop caring once everything being handed to you becomes the norm. Trial, error, frustration, toughness are everything that makes things valueable and engaging to begin with.
---
i agree with you but for me its mostly because with CATA the game changed from WoW to something that looks like WoW, but deep down it really isnt anymore
---
when i could no longer identify with the game, i couldnt identify with the story either... and i realized they were making story just to keep people paying subscription, not because they had great ideas for story - they literally develop the expansion and zones and everything and only after that is completed they create a story to match the expansion
---
The reason the rivalry is one sided is because most of those who play and enjoy retail have never played classic, so they just don't know. Most of those who have played classic, however, have tried retail and realize how far downhill its gone since its roots. If all you've ever eaten were turd sandwiches, they wouldn't seem that bad.
---
lvl 48 gives full honor to lvl 60
---
"PUSSY BITCH..."  
---
Nearly spat out my coffee from laughing.
---
This was discovered like 5 minutes into beta release lol
---
I don't know, from everything I've heard it sounds pretty terrible. The fact that they combined pvp and pve servers together already solidified that.
---
&gt;"Rich blacks commit more crimes than poor whites"
---
But if there's a statistic that says that, and Jontron happened to believe it was an accurate statistic... Should he just \*not\* say it? Honestly that would be more racist than quoting statistics. As if black people can't stand up to scrutiny or some bullshit like that? 
---
There's a big leap between "blacks commit more crimes than whites per capita" and "ergo all people with dark skin need to go bye bye". And I think anyone who assumed that Jontron made that leap is arguing in bad faith. Like destiny. 
---
I believe the statistic turned out to be wrong in the end, but believing it was true doesn't make him racist.
---
Nice!
---
Wrong, aoe spells do not flag you
---
Then leave.  Calm down champ.  Why are you gatekeeping
---
People were doing gear checks by inspecting them near the banks in IF/OG anyway or the banks or other memorable places in Shattrath or Dalaran (pre-GS addon). 
---
Speaking specifically for Classic, I couldn't care less if they implement transmog (after all content is released for some time and if the community wants it) or not, since almost all of my characters on retail look like clowns, even my warrior main. Pugs will only really happen for ZG/AQ20 and maybe MC or Ony anyway and there the gear doesn't matter that much either. The harder raids will almost exclusively be done by guilds where the people know what each other is wearing.
---
Having gear does not mean skill, especially in Vanilla, since DKP is still used a lot and all you need for that is attendance mainly or making shady deals with guild members, save for a few special pieces that may get handed out seperately from DKP.
---
And anyone who judges whether or not they can a character to a BG or raid based on their appearance instead of inspecting them properly is probably a bad group leader anyway.
---
Not really. He seemed to be having fun at first, but after an hour or so he seemed bored, I think he thought it would end but it didn't. 
---
He was definitely a sore loser at the end though, but I don't really blame him. Not being able to get that Axe must suck.
---
Lmao his surname is Jafari. His grandparents were probably immigrants from the middle east.
---
If you look at Old School Runescape, a good chunk of the playerbase use a 3rd party client. 
---
It can do a lot of shit for you, even some gamebreaking stuff. 
---
A lot of it's community devolved into a "efficiency" mindset, where if you aren't gaining experience, you're not playing the game right.
---
Part of the nochanges crowd probably wasn't fully nochanges, and more just worried that there would be a slippery slope if the community signaled to the devs that changes were welcome.  
---
Seemingly everyone who is streaming on the beta says it FEELs like classic.  Some obvious bugs need to get resolved, but the changes that are there graphical, UI, etc do not seem to impact peoples appreciation or nostalgia.
---
You're basically tricking the server to belive that you're standing up as you get critted while sitting.
---
The server checks whether you are standing or sitting, and awards the procs depending on that.
---
It wouldn't be possible if the server check was instant, so a bit of delay is needed to do this trick
---
There's more exceptions, so many that become the rule. 
---
As hunter you get your pet @ lvl 10. Quite an early level to decide, isn't it? Not to say you can't even use traps (a core point of your playstyle) and it takes a while to be able to drop them in combat (FD, lvl 30).
---
Rogue doesn't have any of its stealth tricks (attacking from behind? You just have backstab...) nor poisons.
---
Warriors don't get interrupts nor in-combat gap closer until quite later. And instant attacks (BT, MS, SSlam) also come way later.
---
And well, you've already pointed out hybrids in this. 
---
You get a very basic thing. You get some class flavor and maybe a 10% of playstyle, since you get barely no cds and minimal skills.
---
that is also true, but that is because they are scared that people prefer to play on private servers than on the official server
---
they acknowledge that they have ruined their game and launching classic is their easiest way to fix the game with minimal effort - just bring back the original game from 2004 and people no longer have a reason to play on private servers
---
private servers are free, but they have many negative aspects - drama, server rollbacks, downtimes, gold selling, botting, corrupt staff members
---
i also played on private servers, but that's because i wanted to play vanilla for 7+ years since 2012, now that blizzard is launching classic i will pay them $15 and get the most premium experience i can get..not that private server trash experience
---
I had Rets heal lvl 60 Dungeons, Pala is just a great Healer in Vanilla. But that was with Discord and a good Tank.
---
I'd say up to lvl 50-55 its really no issue. After that you'd already find groups as a healer for every Dungeon, so you can combine getting your last lvls with getting your Pre-Raid Gear.
---
I'd say its no problem for every Class to find Groups, atleast on privates there was always someone running a Dungeon, since People know the Dungeons they mostly don't require a hard-CC DPS like a Mage. So you'd find a Group as a Hunter if theres not already 2 Rogues in the Group.
---
Hi quinn
---
Check chuck
---
I thought he is reasonable, but after watching hia debate with Destiny I realized he don't know ahit about thia topic. Not like it's making him "total piece of shit" but he certainly consumed a lot of political bullshit.
---
I'm probably gonna do some meal prep for day or two and try to push my sleep schedule so that I can wake early in the morning (like 4-5 AM) to play, which hopefully avoids the initial rush and potential server problems. But that's for launch day.  
---
Likely going to play FFXIV once the new expansion is out to pass the last 2 months until Classic.
---
This. Idk who said that asmon had 2 full raids, he never had. The most he had in his raids were 60, snd those were never fully there. Many of those being low lvl, you can tell by the hp in his raid. Im honestly impressed that he was able to hold against the horde alone while the horde was the bigger raid, had better gear, higher lvls and more streamers to coordinate the raid.
---
He's made multiple iterations of the same package over time.
---
Even if it's "elvUI" not "pfUI" that gets ported across its fine cos it's 99% the same.
---
So.. essentially, yes, it will be.
---
People still stalk him in game even if he's not streaming. He's talked about it before. He can't really escape it.
---
I'm hoping that he can get a normal wPvP experience at some point. Usually its just a 1v1 over resources or just for fun; maybe 2-3 join in. Usually its not a 120 man slaughter.
---
I presume you won't be able to make addons that tell you where to complete quests and stuff? Like 1's and 2's on the map?
---
I hope not, anyway.
---
There are Marks of Honor that you get for winning BGs
---
I just hate running Windows (natively) on Mac hardware. And if I’m using Mac I like to have access to my typical set of applications, it’s a pain to “go between worlds” so-to-speak.
---
My gaming PCs are usually dedicated Windows boxes but I always like seeing cross platform support.
---
Now that is something to worry about..more people need to see this
---
i dont know if it was a technical limitation or something but i guess they werent intended to be a playable race at the time so they didnt receive much care
---
high elves and blood elves in vanilla use the beta night elf models that were later given more care because they were a playable race
---
I saw Joana talking about lag taking place at one point. But I am sure they are monitoring it. In fact, I bet some debugging routines are running, which would be catching more detailed bug information (that's why they cause lag, they are gathering a lot of data). At still 3 months out, I'm not surprised it lags.
---
They won't think so, but they may ban you for account sharing which itself is against the rules.
---
Eeeeewwwwww. Different strokes I guess:)
---
Obviously no one would gear check for a raid just by looking at someone. Obviously its bad for pvp, but for immersion its equally bad. Having gear doesnt equal skill, but it does show effort put towards achieving the goal of looking awesome in your set, and it shouldnt be cheapened by others transmogging themselves to look cool
---
get engi for sure, make a gathering alt
---
Master of flag running :')
---
I mean it was nearly the same in Cataclysm it was changed in MoP again to this weird once in 20 levels talentpoint thing. While Cata was like a Hybrid between the old Talents and the new "Specialisation" thing.
---
&gt; that's what free speech is about
---
I can't draw a cartoon so maybe this will be above your reading level,
---
 but no.
---
No.  This is not what free speech is about. 
---
Free Speech is about the government not forcing people to stop speaking.
---
He can and has said whatever he wanted... THAT was free speech.
---
The rest of us are allowed now to look at what he said and go "Yeah mate, that's a trash person I will never listen to again, he is bad and should feel bad." *unsubscribe*
---
Because we are not the government, using force to implement our will that he not be allowed to speak.
---
I'm sure there are better ways to say that but TBH I doubt you will ever understand so I can't be bothered.
---
You are absolutely right, even if dps shamans are meme specs i will play it no matter what. As i said in the post, i will not give up on this. However, it would be nice to accomplish making it viable, making me very happy. This whole post was fueled by this hope.
---
On the same stream he said that she has more money than he does, so if anything he's the gold digging leech. Then everyone spammed Asmongoldigger for 10 minutes straight
---
I think this is called the outlands test zone 
---
dont have access to beta yet but i know at least one other way to get there that should be functional on the beta. last time i played retail i was still able to get there 
---
this and hyjal are the 2 places im going to try and get to first 
---
man i want to do some exploration
---
AI is probably not a correct term. WoW never really had an "AI" to speak it. It's mostly simple scripts.
---
Pathing is a whole other thing though.
---
Aha cool!
---
You realize you're not doing yourself any favors, right? You and people like you, are creating a "boy who cried wolf" situation. 
---
People have pulled the "YOU'RE A RACIST" card so many times, I just flat out disregard it until I see proof. In Jontron's case, I haven't seen any proof. (and no I don't want you to link me any, trust me I've seen it.)
---
It's the same with people accusing someone of rape. Especially if it's 10 years after the fact. I used to believe them, but now we've had so many false accusations, or accusations without proof, I've gone hardline "innocent until proven guilty". Because what other method is there? The justice system goes by that for a reason, socially we should too. The Kavanaugh situation was just a travesty. Even if he did do it, she had absolutely 0 proof. It's just shit-slinging at that point. 
---
My point being, if you want to "fight racism" or whatever, point us to \*actual racists\*, but more importantly, point us to actual racists that are actually effectively harmful. Then I'd stand with you and gladly sling shit their way.
---
In all seriousness, check his debate with Destiny.
---
I wouldn’t call him a Nazi but I do think his views aren’t very well informed.
---
yeah you could be right, i had a vague notion that some of the ghosts were non-elite too.  i think in the room with the boss that drops the shield?
---
Not so true until MS and WW. Only OP scales with weapon damage then, and it won't proc too often.
---
The API is irrelevant, it's what you do with it. Also private servers are not running 1.12, they are running amateur code that tries to replicate 1.12
---
Kinda funny how even old Battlefield games can handle 64 ppl servers and retail WoW can't handle a few more ppl than that.
---
Good that you think
---
They already said they would at blizzcon.
---
He's giving arguments for why he thinks Blizzard will not be able to ban it. Instead of just denying him, please elaborate why Blizzard will be able to ban it, cheers!
---
The loot comes from a pickpocket loot table and no you cannot pickpocket enemy players. Also no quest items from pick pocketing.
---
done the same Saturday evening, if i get a beta at some point i will be happy if not i have something to scratch that itch until live
---
Private servers leveling is insanely accelerated compared to vanilla due to dynamic spawns and other reasons. It's why streamers aren't able to replicate or be close to their leveling speed on beta compared to vanilla.
---
I 100% remember this existing in BC, but I do not remember this in vanilla. Sap in vanilla pulled you out of stealth and put you into combat.
---
Ion is such a huge shithead and he literally single handedly ruined WoW. Wish they never hired some random guy from EJ to run the game.
---
I think you get the same rep if you do the quests later, even if they're gray. Lack of the trainer in Darn will be quite inconvenient.
---
Ya and people made 3 Part Videos because of that :D
---
Well, call me whatever you want but i actually want to use the chats, i dont want an interface where i see character names looking for group and ranked based on some average gear score next to them.. I want the social aspect of this game to be the way it was
---
&gt; but this isn't for everyone 
---
If this was the criteria for banning content, we might as well delete the entire subreddit. You argument is this: A lot of people don't like something a lot of people do like so can we ban it?
---
That's not how this works.
---
p.s. I can't stand the streamer culture (except for some reason Brian Kibler -- but I just watch his daily YouTube highlight games).
---
Didn't know all of them, will check for sure! Thanks for sharing!
---
Because there’s no other way to affect the functionality of an addon... I get that you don’t understand how these things work, so here’s an explanation:
---
Blizzard provides an API for all addons to run off of. It has certain features and commands that allow developers to get data from the game and do things on screen with that data.
---
The data Blizzard gives through the API is like eggs, flour, milk, butter, ketchup, etc. They control what’s in the pantry and the fridge.
---
The function calls of the API are the kitchen. It has a stove and microwave and hand-mixer and all sorts of other gadgets and tools. Blizzard can decide what tools are available in the kitchen.
---
What Blizzard cannot do is decide who gets to use the kitchen or what they make in the kitchen. If a developer decides they want an omelette with ketchup, regardless of how disgusting that sounds, the only way Blizzard can stop a developer from doing this is by removing the frying pan, the eggs, the stove, or the ketchup. 
---
But you can’t remove the ketchup for some addons and allow others to still use the ketchup. Regardless, removing the ketchup might be the best option, since not many addons needed the ketchup to work.
---
A LFR addon doesn’t need rare ingredients like ketchup or fancy tools like a French coffee press. It needs water from the sink and lightbulbs, that’s it.
---
Blizzard is not going to remove the ability to get water from the sink because it would break every addon’s ability to do just about anything.
---
Deadly boss modes? Really? I hate this addon so much. Takes away communication and makes players so much worse. But it seems like players can't live without it any more.
---
Just block the addon. I allready said it, but for some reason he cant comprehend that.
---
Gotcha. Sit to force a crit and stand to be allowed to "cast" the proc, all in one batch. Makes sense!
---
Not sure about official word but there certainly is a difference.
---
In-game there is a “Classic” preset which reduces much of the post-processing effects, shadowing, and ground clutter.
---
It’s absolutely noticeable, especially near areas with lightning and water, but surprisingly not as night and day as I was expecting.
---
If I could best sum it up... it looks “as good” as you remember it looking (through nostalgia’s rose-tinted spectacles). But in fact true Classic probably looked way worse.
---
It also helps that WoW’s art style is a little cartoony, so it lends itself to close approximations instead of hyperrealism.
---
Too much. I crave to get on my bear furs again, but being *encouraged* to heal again (It'd be the fifth time considering retail and pservers... I'm just so fed up) is a big no-go. 
---
But the alternatives are quite far from my playstyle (namely warrior, whose PvP I find lacking. A big issue for a primary PvP player as I am, even if I do enjoy PvE as well).
---
Lol. It was not fixed in Legion beta, in Legion launch, 7.1, 7.1.5, 7.2, 7.2.5, 7.3, 7.3.5, BFA beta, BFA launch, 8.1, 8.1.5, 8.2, 8.2.5. But "hey it'sa beeta chill".
---
How new young gamers with their endless "it'sa alpa, itsa beeta, itsa early access, itsa just launched" loop annoy me.
---
hahahahaha ohhhh nononononono ;) But a big Thank !!!
---
Has anyone reported the mob/elite mob damage discrepancy? Do we know if Blizz is aware of this?
---
Don't you easily get DHKs by doing city raids? Also it's easy to abuse city raids in terms of if you make killing leaders give a bunch of honor since you can feed it to one person and destroy ranking. (Was a thing before wasn't it? Only reason I mention it)
---
I want to main a paladin since I really like their playstyle but I also like dpsing over anything else.
---
The issue here is that I might not have enough time to invest into my paladin to have it do "acceptable" damage.
---
That's why I was eventually thinking about a rogue since that is probably my 2nd favorite class.
---
Hope to get some idea's/input from you guys on what would be a good decision considering my thoughts.
---
Cocaine -  for a healthy living.
---
COME ON YOU APES, YOU WANNA LIVE FOREVER?
---
Yes, that would be a good change. World PvP should be the heart of World of Warcraft.
---
Damn. Well, that's unfortunate, I was really hoping you could loot narratively sensible quest items at least, largely for RP purposes. Instead I have to be a murderhobo, oh well.

---
How is this not lagging at all? How is BfA lagging with 40 people around you?
---
One character for streaming, one for anonymous play. 
---
Solved.
---
I have faith, hopefully they will go back to their golden days after getting a slap to the face when their retail player base just goes down the drain. If they’re crazy enough to upgrade the servers and release it together with their retail sub they’re crazy enough to do that.
---
I'm sorry but I don't think that is a proper argument or explanation. As far as I understand, addons are clientbased that are using serversided tools, they need to block the tools in that case, and that is most likely impossible to target that addon alone
---
Maybe events would be a better way to accomplish this?
---
I feel like making wPvP too rewarding would just cause folks to abuse it (level a few guys on the opposite faction and just trade kills all day). Gamers ALWAYS find ways to abuse things designers intended for fun.
---
Even giving cool rewards for capital raids and killing faction leaders (whether that be honor or loot) ... large guilds could team up and just trade kills.
---
No they aren't. This is the sort of ignorance I am talking about. Private servers do not have access to any of Blizzards server side code. None at all. They both share the client side aspect of it (what is on the CDs). APIs literally have nothing to do with what I was talking about. The fact they're using the Legion engine/client doesn't change any of the vanilla server side code/values.
---
All of the logic/code about how the game works has never been accessible by the private server community. A lot of people mix these areas up even after Blizzard defined the differences at Blizzcon last year.
---
I am very well aware how APIs work. Nothing prevents Blizzard from blocking any specific addon based on its signature
---
ret is never gonna do acceptable damage in raids. also you really like their playstyle? it is more or less just autoattacking.
---
either embrace the meme or just play a 2h fury warr instead
---
oh dude, that is such amazing ! i will it using too as my background !
---
&gt;The procs always get 0 benefit from spell power. Certain buffs or enemy debuffs, like percent modifiers can alter those procs, but no baseline stats alter them. There are some bugged private servers, but in vanilla spell power only affects spells by design
---
Regarding to the comments here from 2006 you are wrong and many weapon procs did actually scale with spellpower https://classicdb.ch/?item=19852#comments
---
It was 60(alliance) vs 80(horde) at peak
---
Oh I don’t want to avoid streamers because I think their followers are toxic (I really don’t, I think streamers are actually good for retail and I watch several myself); I want to avoid a streamer *server* because I’m afraid of what will happen to the server community when that streamer stops playing, or gets involved in some drama. Server community is so much more important in Classic than retail, and I see a lot of potential for a streamer to impact it - positively and negatively.
---
Someone's jealous lol. Why did you stop obnoxiously shilling your garbage stream on /v/? maybe you'll get big enough to have a highlight posted too if you keep at it.
---
"all this complaining 'not real vanilla' is pure cancer"
---
Discount Stormx tho :p
---
&gt; Currently retail players has had their dopamine center damaged by the instant gratification injections by way of epic loot.
---
IMO you shouldn't raid for gear, you should raid for progress.
---
How is it irrelevant? The actions allowed to run in the API **DIRECTLY** affects gameplay and what actions you are able to perform.
---
The fact of the matter is that there are things you could run in the original vanilla API that also worked (replicated) on private servers but that will not work in Classics Legion API. That means that technically, that part is more closely authentic on private servers than on Classic.
---
That all being said. Blizzard had do use the newer API because the old one was too "lax".
---
It is possible and its not even complicated.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Sup y'all
---
Hi, /u/KingDas
---
It was a vicious murloc though!
---
Acceptable as in "good" for being a ret.
---
About their playstyle, yes it's simple but I like the relaxed playstyle together with tankiness and utility.
---
Warrior is something I do not like at all so that's not an option for me :p
---
Thanks for the feedback though
---
The red trail linked in u/Kosouda's post was NOT in Vanilla, BC, WotLK, or any expac up-to-and-including WoD.  
---
I quit in early WoD. I had over 25k hours into the game. 240k+ HKs. Tons and tons of playtime. I NEVER saw that trail in ANY expansion, up to and including expansions just a few years ago. I always had cutting edge machines and had my graphics turned up.  
---
I can honestly say that that twitch stream from Kosouda's link was the very first time I EVER saw such a thick (and, imo, ugly) red trail behind a warrior's charge. It 100% did not exist in Vanilla.
---
I will absolutely pump up the graphics to the maximum. The feelings towards classic come - by no means - from the graphics. To me, they are 100% gameplay related and a more beautiful look of the game will not destroy the classic feeling. Therefore: 100% graphic, 100% fun :)
---
It's called a theme park MMO dude
---
There is a reason they add new raids every few patches lol
---
Insanity
---
I want a challenging questing environment and the oldschool feel of the game itself. max-level dipshits killing quest NPCs for hours on end just killed that enjoyment every time it happened. If they had a system in place that would have stopped max level characters from fucking over people who literally can't do anything to help it, I'd have played PvP. I love organic world pvp, and some unfairness such as ambushing makes it more fun. Bringing a nuclear weapon to a knife-fight is worlds away from that though.  
---
I think I'll play PvE on my "real" characters and then make a "hardcore" character on a PvP realm later on.
---
Remember the nude rogue harras where they just hade weapons equiped and keep stunlocking you and sapping you to death.
---
For sure not someone who should be speaking publicly on the subject. His YouTube channel is fucking A+ though.
---
If you are using a slow 2h seal of command is around a 20% dps increase over righteousness so starting ret for that alone is typically worth it.  
---
Consecration is great, but you will not early on have a mana pool large enough to cast it enough times to kill things with it alone.  Since it isn't enough to kill things, you can't solo aoe pull with it, and if you are single target pulling you wold rather have SoC.  
---
If you are leveling with others consecration can be quite good to compliment their aoe, but most classes don't start out with their good aoe abilities or talents.  
---
I will be leveling a paladin with a warrior.  I plan on going ret for SoC, then coming back into holy,  This way I get consecration and some added healing by the around the same time that the warrior is picking up whirlwind and enrage for aoe pulling.
---
That was so entertaining. I couldn’t stop laughing when he realized his imp was getting destroyed. These are the goofy classic moments I miss.
---
Why not both?
---
i like jontron and whatever he said doesnt change my opinion about him, he is still a good entertainer
---
just like liam neeson, he is still a good actor and i still like him
---
if you need fake journalism websites to tell you when to stop liking or start liking somebody, your opinion means very little
---
Because, in my experience, these arent about the game, they're about the streamer.
---
You spend way too much time to do such a poor joke. Take my upvote.
---
excuse my lack of understanding here not looked into it that much, but isn't laying meant to spread out the players as even as it can over multiple instances to stop make it less likely to have a starting zone swamped on launch and then slowly merger the instances into one when it's more stable?
---
And what about the third outcome that have people that don't want progressive servers?
---
Nice. Sounds amazing! I for one can’t wait.
---
But I don’t understand why I am being down voted or why you reply like I am saying servers will die :D
---
The only thing I am saying is that, technically (and factually lul), layering isn’t meant to mitigate dying realms.
---
There seem to be a majority that don’t really understand what layering is :/
---
DBM? Does that mean I will no longer get 39 whispers saying "You are the bomb!" 
---
\#NOCHANGES DAMMIT !!!!
---
Original vanilla 1.12.1 API: You could automate DPS rotations by way of script.
---
Private server 1.12.1 API: You could automate DPS rotations by way of script.
---
Legion classic 7.x.x API: You cannot do the above.
---
I haven't played anything beyond cataclysm and so I can't and won't comment on retail, but aside from this sub I've never seen a private server player act like that unless they hadn't played anything pre cata and think that private servers somehow are the benchmark for what classic should be, and who gives a shit about what those few people think?
---
You come across as a gate-keeping, holier-than-thou, elitist sack of shit and I don't like you.
---
On a related note, I really wish that wall-jumping were in the game. The experience is not the same without it.
---
Imagine quoting polygon, what a piece of shit you are
---
You don't see a problem with small demographics of players, like hardcore PvErs you mentioned, controlling the fate of the game for everyone else?
---
Thats much more fun in vanilla as its harder. In tbc me and the wife managed to two-man all instances and I dont think that is possible in Classic. Three Manning instances is Challenging from time to time. It is possible to clear all instances but you need really good gear to get past some road blocks. (Like last boss of Lbrs for example). Its when dps is needed it gets tricky. Even when there is no "enrage" mechanic the healer tend to go oom more when the fight gets drawn out so everyone need to use all their tricks and be creative to make it works
---
Wasn't that because they wanted you to feel NOT special? Yes you are a hero but only a small unimportant one. That is why you talk to random npcs and not to King and Queens early one. It makes sense and it is believable
---
That kinda sucks, I didn’t know that
---
And why exactly are you the one that is remembering vanilla correctly while the people saying the mob difficulty is correct, are not? It's he said she said, with one side backed up by Blizzard.
---
yeah i know, nowadays i can only play my old games from when i was a kid:  
---
\- heroes of might and magic 3
---
\- age of empires 2
---
\- tes3 morrowind
---
\- worms armageedon
---
\- nfs underground 1
---
\- star wars battlefront 1 (2004)
---
\- vanilla wow
---
everything else i try... it just feels shallow and stupid.. i only finished mass effect 1-3 and thats because the story was very engaging, but i cant see myself playing that ever again..
---
but vanilla/classic wow.. ive been playing it for over 7 years on private servers and i can play this game till the day i die
---
I was gunna make an attack on the wookies joke, but then i remembered wookies have hair
---
Tips said he was a vanilla player then confessed that he in fact didn't play during vanilla
---
that dude above me is an SJW, downove him to hell
---
Everytime I've watched him he's been pretty shit at his warrior in classic.
---
Pretty much yeah. Cause they think it's bad, the grind is bad, but I think a lot have their own reasoning. Kind of like a "you think you do but you don't"
---
You're right, I've got a couple screenshots saved showing it.  Farming faction leaders is one of the best ways to rank if you can do it consistently and have one person outside the raid tag.
---
&gt; 'Classic makes you interact and has a feeling of community you dont get anymore' -talks only to twitch friends they always talk with
---
This simply is not true for the rest of the playerbase, maybe only streamers because they know so many people already, but even them, they interact with lots of random people that are in their guild, i dont watch many big streamers but ive seen it several times. So this just is not true.
---
&gt; 'Levelling up and talent trees offer you options, reward and choice' -99% of points are 1% damage/crit increase, literally illusion of progress
---
Now, i agree that some of the talents are quite uninteresting with just getting 1 more % of something, but its definitely not the "**literally** illusion of progress" it IS progress, you get 1% more crit than before, thats progress. The illusion of progress is retail where you level a shit ton of levels and dont get a single new talent/spell.
---
&gt; *talk about why BFA is the worst and Classic is best* all the while just walking around doing nothing in Classic, quest to quest.
---
"just walking around doing nothing in Classic, quest to quest." Doing nothing, quest to quest? What? If they're doing quest to quest, they're doing something? I dont think i have tuned into a stream where they are not doing anything because they have nothing to do, there is always something to do.
---
&gt; 'So much fun RPG yay! gameplay fun yay' autoattack 99% of time, use about 4 buttons
---
RPG's are more than just pre-level 30 combat, yes, pre level 30 some classes auto-attack much, but at level 60 things are much different. The RPG element is more than low level combat, professions, weapon skill, traveling, gold management, gearing... i can go on.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but isnt most of the mobs and bosses in MC either immune or have high resistanc3 to nature damage? BWL as well to a lesser extent
---
If they had just made them PvP I feel like it could have been one of the best pieces of content they've added in years. It's absolutely crazy they decided it should be a PvE bore fest.
---
It's a satirical meme hat that says "Make Azeroth Great Again".
---
You can always roleplay you pickpocketing another player if they are roleplaying sleeping and it would end up being an interesting arc between yall.
---
It probably wouldn't work out well, epic open world PvP battles unfortunately aren't a very efficient means of killing. You're more likely to just get large numbers of 60s camping flight masters and graveyards in lvl 50-ish zones, which is often seen on private servers.
---
Ultimately, Blizzard never seemed to want to encourage any kind of PvP that actually impacts the open world, especially dealing with quest givers and such. And since most faction leaders are involved in at least a few quests, they opted to never give them any decent rewards.
---
Personally, back in the day I'd have loved to see faction leaders more or less treated as world bosses, with some serious loot and a long-ish respawn timer, and also putting in some incentive for hardcore players to defend their own leaders. But now I'd say such a thing is clearly beyond the scope of Classic.
---
Well you've clearly never developed addons for World of Warcraft.
---
Addons don't have a specific signature. There are no API keys or authentication. There's no registration of your addon in some central curated repository. It's all client-side. The list of addons you use isn't even being considered by the server.
---
If Blizzard had this functionality, they would ban addons like Babelfish rather than making their use a violation of the ToS, which doesn't stop players from using them, it just makes their use a risk because you can be reported and then suspended/banned.
---
Blizzard isn't going to make the use of a LFR addon against the ToS. The language required to do so would catch a lot of other addons in its web. I seriously doubt WoW Classic is even going to have a different ToS than Retail and there's good evidence to support this, namely in the fact that they share a subscription.
---
You do easily DHK’s and that’s something I wish they would change to incentivize city raids more. Some peeps get worried about getting DHK’s and don’t want to do them. Which I do understand if you’re going for a high ranking.
---
He's a better and nicer person than you, clearly
---
That has nothing to do with them not doing anything.
---
Blizzard releasing BC alongside Vanilla will fragment the community so much, it's basically a death sentence for WoW
---
&gt;what we love about Vanilla isn't necessarily the Raids
---
&gt;A requirement to be allowed to vote could be for example, that you would have to have killed the last boss in the latest raid
---
Ok
---
in pvp it is often worth it to wear plate for the armor. although mixing in some non-plate is common.  
---
in pve where you are never getting attacked, armor is basically worthless.  This is when most paladins with use lower armor tiers.  Using plate only over BIS healing gear would be about a 20% reduction in healing output depending on what phase we are talking about.
---
Please reset al accounts when released:)
---
Why would people play enhance now when they know how absurd / much reliable / better ele is compared to it?
---
There's a few but they have notable downsides to them
---
if the polls were taking place inside the game client more people will vote for them
---
if the polls are on some website, people who are only interested to play the game and dont care about community wont even know those polls even exist
---
but give them the poll as soon as they log into their account, on the character selection screen and cover the ENTER WORLD button so they have to at least read what this is about before they decide whether they want to vote or dismiss the poll
---
&gt; &gt;when the unfinished ~15 year old version of the game is more "Battle for Azeroth" than retail
---
I've seen raid vs raid fights happen like that all the time in war mode ever since 8.0 prepatch in retail. And they even got larger with faction assaults.
---
If you make it a habbit its a good money income. A lot of small amounts add up
---
I think this is the real reason why they're putting so much effort into Classic. Wow is coming to the end of it's life cycle and they want a replacement before it finishes so they're testing which design choice is better for the next game.
---
\&gt; using Kidney Shot for the lockdown combo
---
What a noob
---
I mean, what 'payback' are you delivering? You just turn off people from participating in the community, and anybody who doesn't like Classic still doesn't, in fact, like classic.
---
In short, you're just being annoying with no benefit or gain. This is probably the epitome of stupidity to behave like this, even if 'they started it'.
---
And majority of people are going "that's a trash person" about you being such a thin skinned bitch about someones opinions. JonTron isn't a piece of shit, he's a decent, normal guy and you're hysterical.
---
What does that even mean?
---
Why would you hope that?
---
God I really hate this pseudo elitist gatekeeping..
---
The whole MMO/expansion paradigm is flawed at its core.
---
Stacking content on top of each other is incredibly destructive to the original, cohesive, holistic, organic experience of the world. To this day I haven't seen a single MMO that truly gets around this problem. Vanilla was not designed with 60-120 levels in mind.
---
You can't just slap new, power-creep riddled content on top of an MMO like a sandwich. With enough content stacking on top of each other you dilute the population and make the barrier to entry unrealistic without catch-up mechanics and LFG. Even late Vanilla had catch-up gear that made MC/Onyxia irrelevant.
---
There are many ways to design an MMO. You don't necessarily need power creep to define an MMO. Sandbox MMOs might not be as popular as progression MMOs, sure, but there's more than one way to crack an egg.
---
Your suggestions could be a way of experimenting away from the destructive expansion paradigm toward something more sandboxy, like EvE Online, maybe? (Though EvE has its own problems, too.)
---
not destroy, sorry, badly worded.
---
as another reply to your comment: im thinking more towards this efficency mindset. I love classic and im looking forward to it but:
---
addons for everything, weakauras for everything...
---
if i dont have BiS at 60 i fear theres no way im gonna be able to join a pug.(retail sends its regards) Dont get me wrong. I dont wanna be one of the classic haters, but the experience will be drasticly diffrent in case of community. 
---
Hopefully im wrong.
---
&gt; There is absolutely no reason to not change things like spawn rates on quest mobs in a highly populated area like Elywn Forest.
---
Disagreed. If you dislike it so much, grind elsewhere. That's the point. Stop ruining the game, you entitled BFA baby.
---
I'm planning on having a primary alt so I'm the wrong person to ask, lol
---
Yesterday everyone was having fun doing world PvP in Arathi, meanwhile Asmongold was whining for 45 min about how "they're just too many" and "we can never win" and "it kinda sucks". Even after he took a flightpath out people were still continueing.
---
Yeah, like if it was hard to get DHKs for a city raid then people would be more willing to do it, but otherwise it's a hard task
---
What he is is right, and Destiny is a colossal sperg, one of the biggest idiots I have seen on the internet.
---
What you are talking about is macro/addon API. The restrictions they have in place do not impact anyone actually working on the game. 
---
The reason the API is irrelevant is that it only determines *how* you do things, not *what* you do.
---
You know people are running out of points when they use ad hominem. To return the favor: you clearly have no idea about software if you think such a thing as code without a signature exists
---
Honestly I think it's just too much.
---
Depends if they decide to do stress testing or not, but then it's probably best to wait for an open beta :(
---
Nice job!
---
Both of you are morons.
---
Are they gonna have RP PVP servers at launch?
---
I remember it wasn't available on Vanilla launch but forgot when they added it.
---
good man thank mechanic i think he coined it
---
But that is a statistical fact. When you people say someone is racist, what you really mean is they are honest, huh?
---
He could but whats the point of being a streamer then if you not gonna stream your gameplay.
---
I feel bad for asmon though cuz its clearly visble he would be less frustrated just levelling in peace but im not sure he even can roll on a pve server with all the other streamers going pvp servers.
---
Daily "It's not nostalgia!" thread.
---
It's great for people still playing retail. (But do most people who are interested in classic really still playing retail?)
---
For others who only want classic? The worst business practice against consumers. Why does Blizz charge 15$ per month for retail? It is for the constant updates and patches for the game. As far as i know classic will not be updating or patching anything at all, as it will always stay in classic (until maybe people get bored and they intrroduce expansion). So classic will only have the server upkeep cost after the initial development time, why are they asking for a subscription for that? 
---
For people who only want classic they should just introduce a buy for 30$ or whatever price.
---
There have been addons like this on private servers for ages, and absolutely no one uses them. The community aspect stops things like this since people won't want certain players joining, so they don't trust addons like this.
---
You might think you are jaded and cool. But for a lot of people, seeing people in those stupid red caps (the original, not the Azeroth version) is just telling them "this person is a fucking idiot".  
---
You might disagree with that assessment, but that's what that hat tells the majority of the people.  
---
And "hat hurt your feelings", nah brah, just like "flat earth" and "I don't vaccinate" doesn't "hurt my feelings", it's just a instant red flag.(literally).
---
What you linked does not disprove it, isn't even about the same topic... Your link is literally about the US population as a whole.
---
Looks like a mainhand glaive to me
---
There are pros and cons to playing on a streamers server; I don't think its as simple as just "Its bad don't play on that server", its gonna vary from person to person. 
---
I wouldn't blame anyone who is waiting to here what server Asmon or Soda is going to be on so they can roll somewhere else. I also wouldn't shame someone for thinking it might be fun to play on those servers.
---
That’s true, I didn’t really think about that. However didn’t some guilds back in vanilla used to honor farm by trading kills/wins in BG’s? I remember a few people on this sub talking about it.
---
I can't help you understand that Blizzard doesn't and can't just "ban" a specific addon. But when a LFR addon hits Classic and Blizzard doesn't do anything, we'll come back to this thread and you can apologize.
---
Thats the part i dont envy on big streamers, you can bet his viewerbase would give him shit if he didnt roll on a pvp server, especially when that would mean he wouldnt join the other streamers.
---
Gz on having fun. Thats what its all about! :)
---
Yeah, he is making good videos and his peronality fits it really good.
---
This dude is a cuckold
---
One thing I've noticed something with Asmongold: He knows how to trigger people and he fucking loves it. He knows that by calling vanilla WoW a joke, he pushes the buttons of certain people. For that same reason, he keeps repeating the phrase "Every server will be a streamer server" even though most people should realize that that's bullshit.
---
You're missing the point entirely man. Picking out one specific example like this doesn't change anything I said above and your post is ignorant to how anything works. Like I already said above. The logic and engine are 100% separate.
---
The example above is a difference of engine/API or whatever you wanna call it. This doesn't change the fact they are still using vanilla code and logic. This is why we have [battle.net](https://battle.net) integration and many quirks like the one above. So in that aspect sure, private servers are more accurate but it's far and few between compared to what people on this very subreddit are reporting as "bugs". There's a huge difference between your example above of an engine/API difference and people claiming mobs are wrong or dungeons are undertuned etc which is what I am talking about.
---
God of War (2018)? Witcher series?
---
Anyone can critisize anything if one really wants to, some people like classic for what it is, others may prefer BfA or a different expansion of the game. But in the end it doesn’t really matter that you have a different opinion of a game, as long as you are having fun.
---
The problem with this type of system is, the majority of the casual very vocal community were the driving force behind the instant gratification mechanics that ruined WoW in the first place. Putting control back in the hands of these people would just result in similar mistakes happening.

this sub really needs to be renamed to retailhate or something. its just so awkward now.

"some random guy" LOL
---
so far they have no plans for rppvp
---
I don't know about queues, but I have a feeling that the first day will be a shit show. Even with layering, starting areas are going to be quite crowded. Mobs respawn faster sure, but there's no tag sharing in classic. So fast range like hunters can tag fast. If there's a steady stream of hunters there competing, somebody is going to get frustrated fast.
---
It won't take long to calm down, but that first day will be interesting.
---
Excuse me sir this is a Gamer subreddit we don't say the r-word
---
What is the easiest healer for pve/raids? I've never played a healer so I want something that's easy. From class fantasy alone I would like to play priest, shaman or druid.
---
The only thing like this are armor tokens like the tbc-early wotlk (Naxx/Ulduar) ones, and they're only in ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxx. Futhermore, most of them require other stuff along the token to get the piece of gear through a quest.
---
As a long time Hunter main I always felt something had been off to the way it used to be. Thanks for doing this work.
---
Which is ironically how some people felt back in 2.0.
---
I saved this comment from an old ArsTechnica post at the time:
---
Low effort troll post 1/10 would not bang
---
Then you should be able to see what I'm getting at. Since they are restricting the API this time around it means you wont be able to use the same macros, playstyle, tactics anymore that was previously allowed in the more open, relaxed API both in original vanilla and on private servers. One example would be that we (probably) wont be able to run scripts anymore that contains if/else switches.
---
Lmao, imagine actually being threatened by an addon.
---
About the hat comment, I understand the joke XD I didnt think it was actually anything political,  I just thought he looked like a bit of a tool.
---
Since then I have learned he is not, seems like a cool dude. great IRL streams too
---
What?
---
Check out Tips Out.
---
It’s a beta, of course they won’t get to keep their characters.
---
this is what happened on the server i used to play on more than just outright killing
---
Nothing beats Rhok‘delar.
---
All it takes is looking up the name of the character in Armory.
---
Not really, assuming we can take the devs for their word that they would break the add-ons that try to do lfg type functionality
---
Blizz: "So, do you guys want more content?"   
---
A: "No, there is enough content in my opinion"   
---
B: "No, there is enough content in my opinion"   
---
C: "No, there is enough content in my opinion"   
---
D: "Yeah, new content would be nice in my opinion"   
---
Blizz: "Going by our metrics everyone who has a valid claim to voice their opinion wants new content"
---
You're an idiot and have no idea how addons work btw.
---
Blizzard can't just stop addons working, if they did you could just release another version with another so called signature and bypass it.
---
Stop talking shit about things you don't know about.
---
Having loot drop from faction leaders would have been so dope. I would imagine the loot would change through different patches too, to make it worth doing. 
---
You’re totally right with it being beyond the scope of classic, though. Maybe if they decide to do classic+? Would definitely be in the spirit of the original game and a very interesting change.
---
&gt; 'Classic makes you interact and has a feeling of community you dont get anymore' -talks only to twitch friends they always talk with 
---
This might be the case with streamer, but when it comes to regular players all the QoL has removed the interaction with other players. You would have a hard time playing Classic without interacting with other players around the world of Azeroth unless you have a huge amount of friends playing the same content you are. Classic will bring back the community feeling of an MMO.  
---
This is just plainly wrong. You will use more than 4 buttons, at least on the higher levels. And in all honesty, do you use more in BfA?
---
I did consider this. Warlocks basically negate the resistances to other types of damage but not nature. This would mean that having gear that negates the resistance of your target by say a total of around 60 would be ideal. Luckily, there are some choices, the AQ set being one of them but only for 10 points. If you are lucky enough to get that sweet Kelthu staff that is 25 more points and im pretty sure there is a ring that negates quite a bit of resistance but i dont remember which one. Even without this stuff, a big chunk of your damage would still be either frost (FS and FW), physical or fire (searing totem). If a boss is completely inmune to nature i guess you could just heal for that fight or do damage supporting with totem twisting but skipping LB entirely, perks of being a hybrid class i guess...
---
Hahahaha. Not WoW but reminds me of when I first started playing Overwatch and thought that Lucio's green weapon was to deal damage and his yellow one was to heal his teammates. Took me about 30 rounds to realize, "Wait a minute.. is it my imagination or does he move faster in the green?"
---
It doest look line a gun at all. Its bukly and short, unpleasant to look at. Terrible, sorry.
---
No point in comparing private servers with Classic.
---
It’s the offhand, i can assure you 😭
---
 But that's not a gun
---
I feel like Asmon is so big and so social that he might even attract other streamers to his server, not just viewers. So that will be good to concentrate multiple streamers onto one server. It'll be easier to avoid his army.
---
Probably! Like I said... gamers find a way.
---
It's why PvP will never be as rewarding as PvE. Too many variables. With PvE, it's much easier for devs to control the gold/hour or the loot/effort structure. With PvP, there are too many variables, too many ways to cheat, and it's much harder to tell when someone is cheating.
---
It's unfortunate... because I would rather PvP almost exclusively but that's the world we live in. This is why we can't have nice things ;)
---
Indeed.
---
Hey nothing wrong with starting off with just one and coming back for the second one in a later phase. Remember in Phase 4 we get ZG which is basically the starting point of all the catch up gear.
---
It seems to affect most (all?) races. Also you can moonwalk just like in vanilla if you start strafing left before activating autoshot.
---
My point here isnt to say private servers are more correct than classic. I have no doubt that classic will be more authentic in 99% of all cases. But it some very specific cases, such as the API then private servers are bound to the closer to the original because they are forced to change it this time around for reasons such as exploits, script botting, etc.
---
Props to you if you were allowed in a progression raid without CT_Raidassist in vanilla.
---
I mean there were plenty of people who theorycrafted shit for WoW, but yeah, random may not have been the best way to describe him. But figuring out the math behind shit and how to optimally raid doesn't mean you're a good game dev/designer.
---
This. Constantly dividing the community is dangerous for every server. Plus, statistically very few people actually play on TBC servers in comparison to Vanilla. Whenever a new one has been made, it has an influx of players and then they usually gravitate back to Vanilla. (Just looks at the quantity of players in Vanilla vs TBC servers. - TBC servers have historically had poor retention).
---
Asmongold was basically like "yeah it's true but there's nothing that I or anyone else can do about it" which is fair.
---
I still use Grid.
---
Thank you for the detailed explanation, so you believe only the bigger ones will have an effect on the community. And since i am EU i shouod be totally fine.
---
boo hoo
---
Deadly Boss Mods, seriously? I wish Blizz would disable crap like that. Back in Vanilla we only had Addons that spammed the Raidchat with Timers.
---
They did but its no different from how servers were in Legion, really. The zones are just filled with people for PvP and PvE.
---
If you roll mage and intend to raid, expect to be casting frostbolts 99% of the time. Then when your trinket is up, use that and.... more frostbolts.
---
Unless of course you're the decurse bitch at the end of BWL.. then you just keep casting decurse!
---
I think everyone has this problem.
---
I'm 100% gonna be Druid. This means I'm going to be a Night Elf, because I just can't play cows. My alts probably gonna be a Priest for shadowmeld + mind control fun. 
---
But I also want a farmer alt... probably a Hunter cause I the other three Alliance races are all Taurens to me, otherwise I'd level a mage.
---
Just gonna have to go full small dick NEET energy on release
---
Looking up at the blue post, beta participants are not only selected by having an active subscription, but also by activity and other factors. In other words, if you have been playing WoW for long time, you have a higher chance to be selected for the beta.
---
JonTron is best Tron!
---
Yeah, you cannot have branching in macros in the modern API. However there are a bunch of conditionals that didn't exist back then that makes a lot of stuff possible, you just have to do it in a different way. 
---
I really hope they make it possible for addons to cancel shapeshift forms though, since there is no way to automatically do that in beta right now, and it's really annoying as a druid since you cannot talk to NPCs or interact with most objects while shifted.
---
People can't live without it anymore because bosses are designed around people having it though. Thats moreso for recent expansions though cause without them you wouldn't be able to raid.         
---
But also people used dbm back then so I'm not sure why people wouldn't use it now?
---
 ~~AQ40 X-Bow~~  KT (Naxx's final boss) Xbow, Nerubian Slavemaker. AQ40 only has a gun (Larvae) which is slightly inferior to the BWL weapon.
---
Everything else is on point.
---
And yet, here's me.
---
NOT crying about free speech...
---
It's weird that you get so tore up about my post and need social validation while calling me thin skinned.
---
I knew before i posted what kind of barrens trash lurk in this sub, and I posted anyway because in order for me to care about someone's opinion, I have to respect them first.
---
Damn, that retard looks like a Wrathbabie. Not sure whats more pathetic, his hair or his wifebeater shirt.
---
A lot of streamers pretend to have played vanilla when they actually didn't, guess they lived a lie for years to make themselves sound like they knew more about the game than they really do, and now that Classic is actually a thing they are accidentally revealing they don't know shit.
---
Tipsout for example, guy is completely clueless about anything and everything vanilla related yet claims to have played it.
---
I've been a long time Alliance player. And plan on Playing Alliance for Nostalgia at first. See home much I will enjoy it. However I might end up changing to Horde for the new game experience since I've never played Horde even on Retail.
---
I agree.
---
With Classic coming out, it's great because it cater towards both player bases. Retail might be more up my league now because I don't have much time like I used to. I like it that I can just log in for 2hrs and make some progress. I will however also be playing Classic. Don't know how far I'll go but it would be nice to relive the glory days.
---
Wotf and interupt the heal
---
Ggwp
---
Sure that could be one way of completing the quests you mention. But not everyone is going to play the same way, if you want to rush to 60 this might be a viable way to achieve that. But believe it or not, some players enjoy the lower level content as well, forming a raid to kill the opposing faction for fun.
---
Dude, its not like they send out new Invites every day.
---

Comparing the duel range which is stated to be 9.9 yards, I did this on my LH core PTR. The edge of the dock is min range for autos to the target. If 9.9 yards is the correct duel range, then this concludes that auto-shot minimum range is in fact larger than it should be. I believe this is the best way to confirm it is 10+ on beta instead of 8 yards. Once again nice find u/Kosouda!
---
9.9 yards is 9.05 meters
---
It wont. There wont be "save layers". You wont finish these quests in 5 minutes.   
---
Go away troll.
---
For a few weeks.
---
Guns are shit tho
---
I think the smaller ones will have a big impact, but since that impact isn't broadcasted to 20-30k people daily, people aren't going to be talking about it as much. Asmon and Soda are the lightning rods for streamer hate in regards to how streamers affect the server. Everyone else goes by unscathed.
---
If you don't have game time at all, you have a 0% chance of getting invited. If you add gametime NOW you have a % chance to get an invite. So to answer your question yes.
---
he will most likely already have an npc in game named after him. after so many years blizz employees get an NPC named after them, if i remember correctly they can choose what it looks like and to some extent where it will be. friend of a friend has a panda in the horde panda city named after them.
---
How is it pseudo elitist gatekeeping? lol.
---
So with your logic, hoping that dungeon finder doesn't come into Classic is also pseudo elitist gatekeeping? Calm down lad.
---
7 days, yadda yadda, he reacted to a WoW ninja loot video in which he said he was glad to be a ninja looter.
---
I’m so excited for long and crazy Alterac valley pvp!!
---
14 days played as shaman
---
I lvled 20 lvls on retail with my GF, that hour really made me miss vanilla!
---
This is game breaking for hunters and warlocks, I sure hope they will fix it or I won't main hunter as planned. This is too bug an issue to just overlook.
---
Many servers in Vanilla were picked by Internet communities to be their hub and stomping grounds. This is similar to streamers picking “their” server.
---
The ancient site, SomethingAwful picked Mal'ganis as the home for their goonsquad. There was so much drama caused by them that a splinter group decided to make their own guild after being labeled “Elitist Jerks” by the community.
---
The rest is history.
---
This is wrong. The reason you choose high swing time is for hamstring method. If you aren't using slow swing and hamstringing the mob you are playing warrior wrong and will die more often. Short explanation is that mobs strike fast and you strike slower regardless so you need to be able to equalize that.
---
Well, speaking from experiences on private servers I can tell you that nobody cares for BIS gear for dungeons and even for ZG or MC to an extent. Of course it is expected that you farm the dungeons for certain items and why wouldn't you? Since there are a lot of really good items. Even for retail nobody expects a complete BIS set (especially since that isn't really possible anymore) and more that you reach a certain ilvl threshold and maybe the achievement. There are also quite a few group leaders that check logs to see if the gear you wear isn't just puff and smoke (I did that with my raids), especially for the harder bosses.
---
You just gotta remind yourself, that the general perception of the game has shifted. In the beginning and for the first few months nobody will really care, since you can do dungeons with group members that have half a brain relatively easily and MC only needs around 15-20 people who know what to do. Maybe in a year the tone will shift, but that's still some time.
---
My post is just about streamers, and youtube content makers, i know for a fact  other people are having a blast, no arguments there.  
---
Ok yes tiny stat upgrade are progres, i said literally when i was wrong, but its kinda just what we get on retail a lot of the time, no gameplay change in reality. Its sitll better than BFA because its something tho.  
---
Quest to quest comment: I just meant the walking around. While they walk they arent exactly doin much....  
---
I think even the most classic lover will admit the combat is pretty bare boned.
---
If you will not abuse system personally but others will you could end up on layer heavy dominated by opposing faction because other people from your faction left and opposing faction people joined your layer.
---
Naxxramas memories are there to stay. This raid either pulled guilds together stronger than ever or completely tore them apart. I was one of the lucky ones to fully clear (and farm) this raid. It's been a challenge but so worth it. Those tier sets were incredibly beautiful - to this day there hasn't been a better mage set,  just to name one example.
---
While I'm looking forward to seeing this raid again, I'm actually not sure that I'll be playing long - or consistent - enough to enjoy it again. But who knows :)
---
Greetings to my old friends from EU-Kel'Thuzad Phoenix
---
i hope elvUI is available at launch :)
---
This. Upvoting for visibility.
---
It's actually insane sometimes. Like you can even have a leveling guide open on your second monitor and accomplish the same exact thing
---
If you just put your pet on defensive, you don't need to micro for trap, just for attack and to come back.
---
A healer wouldn't touch this thing. No spirit or mp/5. That's simply a no-go :D
---
someone posted a GM response about this, you only get added to the pool of potential invites if you have an active sub.
---
Thats awesome! mind sharing the link to thingiverse?
---
Those statistics seem to be regarding victimization rather than about the perpetrators, no? I'm guessing [this](https://i.imgur.com/sGynbw2.png) is the source of his claims, but I can't find the paper and I'm growing tired of searching. 
---
fwiw [this](https://img.fireden.net/v/image/1489/54/1489547594897.png) seems to be regarding victimization as well, as far as I can tell this is from "The Changing Relationship between Income and Crime Victimization" by Steven D. Levitt, so there's a chance the BoJ-picture is also regarding victimization.
---
Well in this case the spell batching caused the spell to go off after he landed. The damage from falling obviously wasn't batched.
---
I think 1 total is a good compromise.
---
EU has smaller but actually skilled streamers. Monkeynews, Perplexity and Stormx to name afew.  Im sure a lot of the super skilled Pserver players will start streaming a lot more openly now that its not prohibited.
---
The biggest EU streamer i can think of for WoW is Kungen.  He would always top the WoW section when he streamed. 
---
NA streamers be getting lost in WC and shit lul
---
arguably C'Thun was way harder than Kel'Thuzad itself. The thing with KT was mainly about getting there. The fight itself wasn't THAT difficult. If you've gotten to KT you'd usually end up killing him within a few IDs. 
---
C'thun on the other hand was a beast. Random'ish spawns of tentacles and generally being spread so far was a true challenge back in the day. Though I suspect this time around it's gonna be a  bit easier :)
---
worse than EU, France. Theres 0 wow classic streamer so no problem
---
More buttons doesn't automatically equal better gameplay. Some people prefer slower, more strategic combat.
---
I still feel like this is a problem that mostly pertains to NA. I played EU during vanilla and I honestly can't remember any "infamous" realms. All the drama you heard about came from NA servers.
---
This is a really interesting and funny discussing and topic to watch. For me this seems to be two-folded.
---
On one hand you have people just telling that dungeons used to be harder in vanilla, and then you have people that are trying to compared damage numbers per hit from elites in the dungeons directly with what they can remember from vanilla and claiming them to be too low on the Classic BETA.
---
I'm not entirely sure if doing direct comparison of the numbers is a good idea and a good metric. World of Warcraft: Classic is not Vanilla. It's not World of Warcraft Patch 1.12.2. In order to have the game running on the modern infrastructure, integrate with Battle.net and run on modern hardware they had to take the modern database and the modern database labels and structure and retrofit patch 1.12.2 into this database structure to replicate World of Warcraft Patch 1.12.2 as best as they could.
---
As there are way more labels in the database today compared to back then, are we even certain it's possible to just replicate the values from the old 1.12.1 database into a database on the modern structure? I suspect this is not possible, so they have to input different values in order to achieve the same dps output from the mobs within the game.
---
So perhaps monster A hits for less damage, compared to vanilla. But perhaps there are other labels and factors that will account for it? Like attack speed being slightly higher so in order to get the overall same amount of damage output from the mob as in vanilla, they had to slightly lower the damage per strike as it was not possible to perfectly tune the mob to hit the same amount of time per minutes as before?
---
And how do you do a direct comparison? There are so many variables in play here. Character level, class, talent points, gear, buffs, potions and whatnot. Unless you have identical characters running on the old patch 1.12.1 vanilla client and server and directly compare it to the very same character on the classic beta how can you really tell what the damage numbers are supposed to actually look like?
---
Many seem to compare with private servers but why should we believe that these private servers have perfectly replicated damage numbers? I've played on many of them and I enjoyed it a bunch but they all have a lot of scripting issues and whatnot so I wouldn't use them for any kind of reference.
---
In terms of how hard vanilla dungeons really was I suspect this is more of instance when people have convinced themselves that it was harder than it really was. I also remember them to be difficult, I played vanilla, tbc and wotlk and to be honest it's somewhat hard to remember if my memory is from vanilla, tbc or wotlk and the content got tuned during both tbc and wotlk.
---
What I do remember is how god awful I was at the game. I was so young, had never played any MMO before and was utterly clueless at the time and I still managed to get through most dungeons without wiping too many times. Considering the wast amount of knowledge people have today when it comes to classes, optimisations, mechanics etc.. There is no wonder why things seems much easier.
---
It was a few things that made dungeons hard. It was because of having a tank that was clueless so bad handling of aggro would get DPS and healer killed all the time. Or having a healer that was just wasting mana for no reason, overhealing, getting aggro because of spamming out pointless heals etc.. Or because you entered dungeons undergeared, or perhaps the most common mistake going into dungeons underlevelled. It's normally a 10 level difference between the entry mobs and the end boss in most vanilla dungeons so I often ended up in groups trying to tackle a dungeon we had no real chance of doing due to us being too low level. It might start of looking half-decent only to go down the drain soon after when digging deeper into the dungeon.
---
From what I can remember we couldn't inspect talents of other players either? So you had no real clue if the tank was even specced into tanking before tossing the invite. And often you would not be patient enough to wait for higher level players so you just took what you've got making your group often becoming underlevelled.
---
With players being so much better and knowledgeable about the game and the dungeons, and with most players more likely to not take on dungeons while being severely underlevelled, with most tanks actually knowing about aggro and how to tackle it and with healers not as likely to waste healing and mana it won't look nearly as hard as it used to.
---
Thats assuming theres 2 layer. Were talking 2k peeps on Eastern Kdoms, wont happen that often. And even if it did, why layer A would be safer than layer B?
---
Dude, you gotta get that new low level epic gear :) Check out [xpoff.com](https://xpoff.com) for more info
---
But how do they unbalance the server, what does it matter when it will have a reset after the beta?
---
Well whatever the details are, they made it incorrectly in the beta. As long as you activate the spell when you are [latency]ms away from falling you wouldn't die.
---
This website is actually the reason I finally remembered my old guilds name. While I completely forgot the name, just browsing through my servers (Kel'Thuzad) character names I instantly reconnected with those names and remembered good fun times.
---
Wasted on human hands.  
---
The only weapon in the game that's clearly designed around a single race... THE DORF MASTER RACE!
---
My respect for YouTube content creators that are streaming the beta has dropped quite considerably. I know this sub has a reputation for bashing streamers, but I do find it really annoying and hypocritical that before the beta some YT content creators were banging on about how they can't wait for the hard reality of Classic. Now they're in the beta, they are accepting trades for every item without farming, running dungeons with lvl30 subscribers so they barely have to focus, needing on random loot. It's all very entitled. I feel sorry for them really, because I do believe they were genuinely looking forward to the idea of Classic, but the reality for streamers is that they won't have the anonymity of being just another adventurer - they'll have everything handed to them and they won't experience the true game.
---
Yes, if layering works like this. That could happen, but no one knows how the actual implementation is going to work.  
---
Either way this was the case 14 years ago as well. Factions controlling certain points of interest in the game. Nothing is forcing you to do those quests (I assume we are still talking in the same context) at that precise moment, you could just go and do something else until it clears up.
---
You're paying for 'World of Warcraft', not retail or classic.
---
What version you play is up to you.
---
lol
---
I can't help but feel like you are just thinking about BfA. You can't really blame the whole industry for one game.
---
Guild Wars 2, Wildstar (dead now, though), The Elder Scrolls Online, Final Fantasy XIV and so on all embody strong RPG elements. I fail to see how the MMO industry has these problems.
---
The problem the MMO industry *does* have is how hard it is to actually make a good MMORPG. Unlike a single-player game like Assassin's Creed you have to make a game for thousands of players and they need constant updates to keep their interest. It is a lot more work and also have *a lot* more ways to fail. Just look at Wildstar, they screwed up their launch and that haunted them for years, snowballing to where it eventually had to shut down. It is a big risk trying to enter this specific market. Point being, it takes a lot to make a quality MMORPG with a healthy playerbase. Obviously there won't be tons of quality MMORPG.
---
Furthermore, you have to remember that many people don't *actually* like MMORPG's as a whole, they like *WoW*. It might be modern WoW, it might be Classic - it might even be some other expansion. But many people love WoW but would never touch other MMORPG's. Many people compare all MMORPG's with WoW and obviously they either fail because they are too different or they fail because they tried to be WoW, which they can't be.
---
So overall, I honestly don't see your point, there are problems but they have nothing to do with lack of RPG elements in current games.
---
&gt;Also, a lot of these streamers will congregate on the same servers. Sodapoppin, Guzu, Esfand, Staysafe, Tipsout, Asmongold (unless he chickens out and rolls a PvE server) will all be on the same server.
---
Or if Soda caves and rolls Alliance; he said he hates being a cow. He says at least once every stream. I imagine if he did that he probably wouldn't roll on Asmon's server.
---
It really depends on how many servers there are going to be. Developers have basically just said a "small amount". I think if its less than 25 servers, then Asmon and Esfand are right, its basically unavoidable. 
---
I think if the server numbers are low enough, there will be enough 1k-4k streamers to pepper every server.
---
I want gearscore, when ?
---
yes, we can
---
No they weren't. You could create a custom chat channel that anyone could join and communicate on, regardless of where they are in the world. I don't remember if the optional password was available in vanilla, but it is now in beta. All you have to do is type "/join &lt;channelname&gt;" and you're in.
---
A LFG/LFR addon will absolutely exist and aside from automatically teleporting you to the dungeon, it'll pretty much look and feel the same as Retail. 
---
It will create/join a custom chat channel that is automatically hidden from view (you won't want to see any of the text anyway, it will all be gibberish to humans).
---
It will use your player data (level, gear, spec, etc) to determine what role and dungeons you're eligible for.
---
You'll "queue" and a message will be sent out to this invisible channel with everyone's addon keeping track of the updated feed.
---
When 5 people are ready, the addon elects one person as party leader and sends out invites to the other 4. Done.
---
I'm a regular over there ;)

Blizzard is a company. Companies have to make money.

Unfortunately for you, so many people ***do*** like their product that your complaint won't matter.
---
This is the reality of things. Deal with it.
---
This dude is a SJW snowflake......
---
Funny you say that about Tauren. I’ll be rolling a Tauren as my main! My alt will be an orc and a troll hunter as my farmer. Also I’ll have a twink rogue UD for shits and giggles. The main question is Warr or sham. My goal is to raid. I hate healin and love tankin! So the answer is pretty clear, however the armor and animation on orcs is soooo much better!
---
I remember way back in Vanilla the easiest way to reset, was having a friend inviting you to a party; this way you could actually reset your last visited instance.
---
Why is that?
---
Mages and Rogues will be popular - they're strong, easy, and in demand.
---
I have my doubts about Warriors on the other hand, they're strong and in demand sure but they're also one of the more mechanically complex classes and the levelling experience is pretty rough. As much as surveys might show they'll be abundant I doubt a lot of people will truly commit to them and you can't really use private server demographics either since they're more dedicated players on average.
---
He is asking if anyone resubbed AFTER the beta was announced and got invited.
---
From what I've seen from the right distance it gives a little bit of a glow to the ground and I really like that honestly, although I'd prefer clutter around a 7/10 with the same selectively "bloomy" effect.
---
What is preventing layer being heavily dominated by one faction?
---
They confirmed this already.
---
[This 30/0/21 spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zAcMqZZVcIz0xo) is fairly common but you're still healing on raids. It's used as a "selfish" spec so you can raid and PvP without respeccing.
---
Unfortunately DPSing on raids is just not really worth it.
---
If playing classic keeps me out of the pub for 1 day a month I’ll be better of financially anyway. So I don’t care.
---
I don't know. Do you really think all these streamers will pick separate realms? I feel like smaller streamers often mimic the big boys. 
---
But still, even if it's 25 in NA, that's still just NA.
---
You guys are all retarded, grow up
---
The stock raid frames are 1000x better than Luna. Luna looks like bottholes.
---
I was just pointing out the reality that you whining about JonTron on here is unlikely to ever change anyones opinion about him, so you're actually just doing nothing else than announcing us that you are really butthurt about him having opinions.
---
Normal, well adjusted people don't give a shit what someone elses political opinions are, it's such an irrelevant aspect of a personality and not worth basing your entire opinion about them on it. In other words, almost no one cares what his political stances are or what you think of them, when Jon is a very charismatic and funny dude, these are things that matter far more to well adjusted people.
---
There's my advice for you on how to not be disliked by literally everyone. No one wants to hear people constantly talk about politics.
---
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3642241
---
Here you go
---
Confirmed that some has been invited when resubbing after beta was announced?
---
Going over in my head how I should plan out my levelling routes with quests and items I need to be sure to pick up for ease later on, and then not doing it.
---
I had the same discussion when i was progressing in legion. There hasnt been a single boss where dbm was mandatory. Its just nonesense. Why would you be unable to raid without them?
---
Brotherhood of Metal was the #1 horde guild
---
Its still a low chance but yes. im like 99% sure.
---
at least , layering gives a reason to cry on this sub
---
The requirements idea is good, but not the one you mentionned.  
---
I think that if they have to make a Classic+, they should not only add new end game content, but also pre 60 content.  
---
I firmly believe that the expansion mechanic is heavily flawed. It always add new max level content, while making obsolete everything from the previous years.   
---
It makes the game smaller, not bigger.  
---
What Classic+ could do is just like you said, polls, but the requirement should be having a character at level 30.  
---
It could add new low level dungeons, new professions, new zones in the continents ( both max and low level ), keeping the same overall difficulty etc ...  
---
As for post Naxx content, you don't have to have gear that overpowers the previous ones.  
---
A smart mechanic is passives/actives on items.  
---
Let's say they release Karazhan 60, a 40 man raid.  
---
Items could have slightly better stats than Naxxramas ( not 10 more stamina for examples, it's already too much ) but they could also could have interesting mechanics.  
---
Here's an example : you loot an item on a boss with more or less the same amount of stats than an item looted from Naxxramas, but it also has an effect like : Active : During 5 seconds, your spells have a chance to stun the target.  
---
Or : Passive : As long as you're not at full health, your mana regenerates 10% faster.  
---
I'm no game designer, but I'm pretty sure there are a lot of ways to have end game content without makin the previous content obsolete, or without having a power spike.
---
Thank fuck I’m EU and don’t have to deal with this in any impactful extent. I honesty really feel for you guys. 
---
Here’s to hoping every streamer announces their server choice before release.
---
I have seen a streamer use /camp to teleport to outside an instance portal. They also have added a function to right click your character portrait to reset instances instead of the /ResetInstance macro.
---
Not without breaking the functionality of just about every other addon they won't.
---
Why did you direct that at me? That's incorrect use of the reply function.
---
Im thinking now I’ll just have 2 characters. Start with my orc warr, and make my Tauren shaman after and just not name either of them my “Main Char Name” since it’ll be on my battle ID already.
---
sorry i did the mistake to answer you

 **&lt;Byte Club**\&gt;
---
​
---
**Region:** EU
---
**Realm/Prospect Realm Type:** PVP
---
**Faction/Prospective Faction:** Alliance
---
**Timezone/Active Hours:** *(GMT+2)* Sweden
---
**Language:** English (a small percentage, myself included, speak Swedish too)
---
I had a random thought, which lead to an idea that might or might not be something I turn into a reality, which is why I'm making this post; to try and get a reaction and see what people think.
---
**The short version:** create a guild for serious players who like me also have to deal with life so they are forced to play as filthy casuals (that was a joke), but who ALSO either know how to program or are interested in programming. Hence the name: "*Byte Club*".
---
**Tiny bit of background:** I'm currently a student studying Software Engineering (mostly C++, a little DirectX11/12) with a slight background in video game design, in Sweden. Next year will be my 5th and (hopefully) last year. I'm really looking forward to playing some classic WoW, even if it won't be in a more hardcore manner, but I thought doing so with a bunch of like-minded people could be an interesting experience.
---
Thoughts? (:
---
P.S. Since I'm already posting, to any C++ (possibly C too) programmers out there; I'm currently working on an Isometric game engine that I'm hoping is going to turn out quite user friendly, with some (hopefully) decent guides. (Y)

*01010011 01101000 01101000 00100001*
---
When did they start then if not in classic? Because that was how it was up until one of the xpacks post cata. I remember very clearly people bitching about flagged enemy players standing in your aoe spells causing to flag.
---
&gt;I have opinions that actively hurt people. Why do people get angry when I express them??? :((((
---
Imagine thinking politics is just sports. I thought I wouldn't have to say something like this here but: Grow the fuck up.

I don't know what I'm doing.

 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild   
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.  
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment  
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.    
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.  
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
&gt;I don't know. Do you really think all these streamers will pick separate realms? I feel like smaller streamers often mimic the big boys.
---
There is a limit to how many communities one server can support, just in terms of server capacity. So I think it would be inevitable that they'd have to be on different realms. 
---
Plus I imagine some of these streamers must have a big ego (lol) and want to be THE streamer on a particular server, and you can't do that on Asmon or Sodas server.
---
Explain how it's garbage.
---
Every game publisher nowadays is trying to push a subscription-based product to get a constant cashflow similar to most other services today (Music, TV, Internet, Phone)
---
WoW being one of the first ones to have a sub model was strange at the time, but now everyone wants it, EA is pushing their OriginAccess and others will come soon too, with Blizzard already having an established subscription program there is NO way in hell they are doing anything else, 100% impossible.
---
Honesty it looks like some toy.
---
I haven't ever used lua, but I'm pretty sure after looking at a couple parts the guy just copied some add-on for BFA (and legion) wq LFG groups. Considering there's a bunch of stuff checking for things like ilvl, and IDs specifically of different BFA world quests.       
---
Aka it's a troll.
---
Not only that. But there's a big issue with the numbers due to inflated hp and damage numbers.
---
I think its strengh for cat dps, but usually for levelling you want a mix of str/sta and some int. But better check a correct guide. Google taladril for some good numbercrunching
---
Ok, just noticed a BIG ONE.
---
MN's streaming scarlet monastery farm right now. For those who will read this late, here's [vod link.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427272471)
---
It would seem that dungeon instance cap per hour is not implemented on the beta. Their average run takes a 5 minutes approximately, yet there's no lockouts to be seen. Is that intended or?..
---
Based on wiki:
---
&gt;As of Patch 1.9 or so, players are limited to entering 5 instances per hour. Meaning that if you start your first run at 1:00pm, and do 4 more runs within an hour, you will not be able to enter any more instances (aside from Battlegrounds) until it is 2:00pm.
---
chance is actually pretty good. So glad I have him to watch instead of just staysafe, esfand and tips (good riddance to all of them now that real streamers are finally playing. although watching tips try and leech himself into chances stream is pretty funny) now that the beta is out.
---
Are you seriously struggling with the concept of opinion and personal preference? Let me put it as simply as I can without crayons.
---
Many people do like pvp in WoW. So what? Are you telling rp'ers that they too are not playing the game correctly, just because they like an aspect of it that is different to yours?
---
I don't enjoy pvp in WoW.
---
I like faffing about in the open world, something that I find is lacking in modern "theme park MMO" WoW.
---
Imagine getting worked up because someone doesn't like the things you do, in a videogame no less. My preferences don't invalidate yours, me not liking your favourite part of the game isn't a personal insult.
---
PS.
---
&gt;And engineering isn't jsut near required. Welcome to what MMO's originally were hahaha. Welcome to RPGs.
---
I can't speak for the very first MMOs but I don't remember engineering being a thing in say, Runescape. Nor in any other RPG I've played, come to think of it.
---
&gt;Don't even lose anything when you die
---
Exactly. You are taking this casual carebear mmo way too seriously.
---
Your subjective opinion isn't an objective truth. Deal with it.
---
There are other ways to explore. And walljumping isn't really removed per-se, it's just way harder.
---
This whole scenario is why vanilla was such a good multiplayer game.
---
EU had foreign language servers after a while, but before that, playing on servers like Grim Batol (which was claimed by Portuguese people) was a pain. They literally refused to communicate in English.
---
That is the vanilla social experience. It was a much more toxic environment. I’m still hoping to get into the beta tho 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
This is such a stereotypical classic/vanilla moment and it's fantastic.
---
&gt;	I love how deep you go
---
;)
---
It is always the same.
---
I say: "I don't like this guy because I find his opinions on matter "x" really, really bad &lt;insert reason&gt;."
---
Someone else: "Free speech and also you are  *"such a thin skinned bitch about someones opinions"* you better shut up." (which sounds *hysterical* btw.)
---
So they do not only separate free speech of its true meaning (government not allowed to silence people) but also think it isn't free if you get critizised for what you say or have to live with the consequences, or they feel they are getting silenced while at the same time no one hindered them to say what they wanted. It also is only free if you like it and everyone else should shut up or is a &lt;insert slur&gt;.
---
Jon Tron can say what he wants, when he wants to say it. He still has a world view that is highly questionable and he repeats extreme right arguments and does not even understand what he is talking about. That he is otherwise "a nice guy" and fosters that image, makes it worse. That he has influence over so many followers, young people mostly, that identify with him heavily, as is to see in this thread, is dangerous.
---
I agree. If we had open immigration at one point in our history, we should have open immigration until the end of time. We have no right to change the laws of the past.
---
I don't really care about this discussion either way and didn't read the article, but still wanna point out that your quotes don't disprove anything the poster above you said.
---
Just because you provided *some* link, doesn't mean it's valid to the discussion.
---
Well you must have read it somewhere?
---
What have you started. Holy shit
---
Crying myself to sleep.
---
Believing the statistic to be true doesn't make someone racist, but actual racists will use statistics like that to claim black people are genetically inferior to white people or are biologically predisposed to be criminals.
---
yeah like i didnt say let every timmy play whatever the fuck they want
---
you could certainly fit in one of each:
---
Retribution Paladins
---
Feral 
---
Boomkin
---
Arcane Mage
---
whatever the least popular shaman build and hunter build is etc
---
A few of them actually bring worthwhile buffs to the raid , and if the players are actually good they wont be dead weight to carry
---
that said , i dont think you can really fit in a prot paladin to raids and possibly 1-2 other builds but prot paladin is the only thing id rather not take. People did use druid tanks during vanilla and its always good to have a few spare tanks in the guild , the druid tank can be feral when its not needed for tanking. 
---
I dont know much about ret but i believe there is some weapon debuff or something its worth having them apply ; he could also have an ok healing set and be able to temp fill a healing slot if someone is a no show
---
a lot of raiding is about flexibility in a lot of cases it would be worth letting a few quality players play the non meta build as long as they were wiling to fill needed rolls if there was a no show
---
You need to finish the starting quests, and at least get to 5 or 6 before heading to Mulgore.  You won't have access to enough quests in the Tauren starting area and your class quests require you to visit the trainer in the Orc/Troll starting area.  AFAIK
---
No. The purpose is to open wow classic with, say, 20 servers instead of 75 servers. Each server will have layers consisting of an entire servers worth of players.  Then, as phase 2 comes closer, the layer will begin to merge to create a single server. This will avoid dead servers that will inevitably happen if they were to open 75 servers at launch.
---
It has absolutely nothing relating to having swamped zones. Each layer will have an -entire- servers worth of players and you’ll be completely fucked in terms of trying to complete quests and fight for resources. It does NOT solve the same problems that sharding solves
---
you are free to have your opinions like how jontron is; same way how we are allowed to talk about anything else. free speech is an absolute for everyone, regardless of their political beliefs, thoughts, opinions, and so on.
---
it doesn't mean i have to respect your opinions, i can start an internet argument over it if i wanted to because that's also free speech.
---
Thank you for your work! 😘
---
I just love seeing these screenshots when people cry in outrage over "addons will destroy classic". Like KID PLEASE we all used a bunch of addons for EVERYTHING, it did not destroy a thing.....im getting tiered of these comments in other threads.
---
Funny you say that because I think the exact opposite. I am going to play classic exclusively because I have to little spare time these days. I quit retail because it encourages daily playing. Daily/weekly/monthly rewards. New patches rendering my gear useless, more daily things to do..  
---
In Classic I can just log on and do a few quests. I can progress at my own pace and it will all be there waiting for me. No need to log in every week, im never missing out on anything. Its all just a chill journey I can go to whenever I want.
---
God i fucking hate tips out
---
How the he does someones opinions actively hurt someone else?
---
**&lt;Crab Bucket&gt; [Alliance] EU [RP-PvP] English**
---
We are a 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **RP-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
**Raid information**
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent single bid, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
On our discord you can find info on how to join.
---
https://discord.gg/qN9ywMy
---
Nope, that's exactly how spell batching worked which is what made it so annoying in the first place. 
---
1. You press the button and the spell is placed in the spell batch with a time stamp, the cooldown you get on the spell will begin from that time stamp once the batch has been processed.
---
2. You die
---
3. The spell batch is executed. Your spell is cast but you can't gain the benefits of the spell since you died before that happened. 
---
This happened more times than I can count back in vanilla. So many lay on hands that were cast and the tank still died because of spell batching.
---
Your idea is the worst. Blizzard changes Classic and then there is no more Classic. :P
---
First, Classic should be left alone. If Blizzard really wants a Vanilla+, it should be on separate servers.
---
Although I doubt they'll do that. The most sane (and profitable) is to release TBC, Wrath, etc. servers.
---
"But it splits the community!" is not a good reason for not releasing them. After sufficient time has passed, it's not a choice between people playing on your "Vanilla+" realm and between a TBC realm. it's a choice between people playing TBC or not playing at all.
---
Those who *really* want to play Vanilla, will play Classic without changes. There will always be a at least a few realmfull of them.
---
I did not say anything about free speech, you're using strawman arguments there.
---
I was pointing out that it IS being a thin skinned bitch to try and make every damn topic shift into politics. Got nothing better to do with your life than be perpetually triggered? No one else cares, he's a funny and entertaining guy, that's all that matters.
---
&gt;He still has a world view that is highly questionable
---
No, he really doesn't. You're just hysterical.
---
&gt;That he has influence over so many followers, young people mostly, that identify with him heavily, as is to see in this thread, is dangerous.
---
There's nothing dangerous about his views or anyone agreeing with them. You're being hysterical.
---
LOL no one reads the question.
---
helps you save on poison reagents as well as you get them from the lock boxes a lot of the time when pick pocketing
---
You're allowed to disagree with him and challenge his beliefs with your own opinion on the matter, but this "Look at this guy let's downvote him" thing you're doing is embarrassing.
---
so why even have gear then? Just make all gear cosmetic and make stats even for everyone, would probably make balancing easier too.
---
It is removed.  The old way of walljumping atleast. You can still make a pixil jumps but cannot climb entire mountains anymore.
---
Sadly you just get the full 100 rep per quest if its yellow (just as XP). If its red or orange you get a little less (I think). If its green you get 60 or 80 and if they are grey you just get 20 rep per quest.
---
I really want the saber mounts. Questing in Teldrasil Darkshore and Ashenvale will get you really far. But the traveling...
---
lmao
---
No.  BfA makes actiblizz more money.  That's the only philosophy they care about.  They did classic wow as a means to get people back into retail and buying micro transactions again.  
---
They will never release a new MMORPG in the style of classic without micro transactions.  It makes no fiscal sense.
---
I assume you aren't clearing mythic for CE then. You wouldn't be able to keep track of abilities, when adds come, timed phases, basically anything time related or anything special you NEED to know.         
---
Like you could replace things with weakauras but thats also another tool that's heavily utilized and it'd be a pita to make ones for every timer.      
---
Plus I don't think any good guilds will actually let you raid with them without running dbm or bigwigs, and then having weakauras is like a personal choice
---
I suppose you've never said stupid shit in the past that didn't have any basis? Its clear Jon was on a heavy diet of Sargon and his ilk at the time and took what they said as accurate information and as solid actors. He's clearly been severely called out for his ignorance and certainly seem to have learned from it. And I would forgive ignorance upon repentance of said ignorance.
---
Glad this us vs them boogyman shit has already dispelled any notion that I'll be getting anywhere near the same experience or community feel I did when I was younger and I won't just be under petty scrutiny of people who want to dump on my fun and contrarians who can't just enjoy something for what it is without pulling some tribalism shit, even if said experience is already far removed from the original 'social' experience which was HEAVILY ingrained in the culture of the internet at the time.
---
Sucks that y'all are already turning people off classic with your bull. ¬¬
---
There are two rogue quests where you have to pickpocket NPCs (rather a lot of them for the second quest in Hillsbrad) but there aren't any others.
---
so looking forward to PVE
---
I will play with some shitty pve spec, inefficient for pvp and enjoy the lore, dungeons, professions, guild
---
BGs, raids to assault cities for pvp, (I can control when I pvp)
---
your already subbed to a game with pet battles
---
You don’t know how it works so....
---
17 is quite high for rfc.  I'm sure he was fine.
---
There's no collections tab, so you would have to carry each of those pets in your inventory if it even were to be considered.
---
I think it's more so worry that being on a realm with a bunch of streamers will make it focused around them rather than a regular experience. Like providing them everything they need, sniping anyone who happens to wpvp them 1 on 1, etc. Not really a problem though since you can easily avoid that realm
---
I did not know people actually made [these](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fc/7e/b4/fc7eb47b50611a9378ae6871142b3c07--divorcing-a-narcissist-divorce-party.jpg) =P
---
Sry to break it for you, but Blizzard don't have those indepth analysis like you think.
---
I'm just gonna give Blizzard the benefit of the doubt and assume their layering algorithm isn't going to pull people randomly, and its going to have systems in place to balance out the layers evenly.
---
Go back to 4'th grade.
---
I don't know anything about JonTron, never seen a minute of his content in my life.
---
I didn't read the polygon article, because calling htem an opinion rag would be an insult to opinion rags.  
---
I don't care about him or about your opinion of him, and I never said otherwise.
---
I addressed a very specific, pernicious,  false statement about free speech.
---
So you are arguing with a figment of your imagination. 
---
As for how not to be disliked... 
---
I find that people with both reading comprehension and basic logic are usually ok with me, and the rest don't matter.
---
Jesus..
---
Ohh good idea, haven't played Worms Armageddon in a decade lol. Maybe some p servers and play the opposite faction to see if it's nice to try Horde on Classic..
---
Thats how gun laws work in the us though isnt it?
---
Alliance of consisting of a  human black dragon and a lich king!
---
Yes - a guildie of mine resubbed and he got in the next beta wave! Keep in mind that so far it seems only people from NA with account from 04 to 06 have been invited so I suggest you subscribe if you only meet both of thoser criteria! Ofc things can change later on and people from other regions and younger account might be invited but we will see when that happens from peoples reports
---
yeah I mean they stopped caring about their game after Wotlk anyways, vanilla/classic wow has more attention than all of those expansions combined and this dev team seems to be competent I'm sure they'll see this post and fix it before the game actually launches.
---
Get out of here you bow using elitist. This is a man zone.
---
That is pretty ineresting. Thanks :)
---
Most fun I've ever had watching a twitch stream live.
---
Did you do a few runs with Asmon? I seem to remember seeing your name in a stream?
---
That's a face of confusion!
---
Pets and toys are perfectly reasonable to put into classic wow. And as an added bonus(for the purest crowd) anyone who doesn't want to deal with them can simply disable them in the options, so they will not appear in any way, shape, or form on your screen. Oh and by the way in case you're screaming at your screen going "there were no battle pets in vanilla!" There actually were battle pets, they just weren't considered battle pets, as much as random companions that would follow you around like for example the disgusting oozling, it was still a thing, and you would still look green from it, there just was no battle feature for it.
---
And also a side note, battle pets will be way harder to catch in classic as it didn't actually have flying, therefore instead of just flying around getting them relatively quickly it will be a real challenge to find/get to them.
---
I dunno, aiming for the High Warlord/Grand Marshal title and gear was pretty fun to go after.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
The crunch from alliance skulls beneath by boots is all the reward I need!
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
Aren't 8, 9, and 10 like the same point? At least 8 and 9 then.
---
Ah, so they fixed it. Damn. Thanks for the info
---
that wasn’t the question
---
Oooh, good find. The comments in that second link include a YouTube video from way back in 2006 of a paladin using Shard of a Fallen Star to nuke people for WAY more damage that he should be capable of without spell damage scaling.
---
&gt;Destiny: So what if whites became the minority but most brown people assimilated to the culture. Would that be okay then?
---
&gt;Jafari: Yeah, but if they assimilated, they would enter the gene pool eventually and would just... you know...
---
&gt;Wealthy blacks also commit more crime than poor whites, that's a fact. Yeah, look it up.
---
Is this proof enough?

Stiamo cercando player Italiani per capire se fosse possibile fare una gilda interamente italiana con un approccio semi-hardcore.
---
Siamo diversi player con molta esperienza su server privati e su retail vogliosi di fare una gilda per pulire tutto il content PvE e per organizzare eventi PvP.
---
Per ora siamo ancora all'inizio e vogliamo vedere quanti italiani potrebbero essere interessati, sia se cercate una gilda hardcore e volete giocare tante ore al giorno sia se volete semplicemente vedere dove andrà la community italiana vi lascio il link di discord dove ci stiamo radunando:  [https://discord.gg/dmJDHwN](https://discord.gg/dmJDHwN)

source please
---
Paladins the easiest healer overall, but of the classes you mentioned I'd recommend Druid &gt; Priest. 
---
There's arguments for both but the tl;dr is - Druid is straightforward and primarily a single target healer, mostly relying on casting different ranks of the one spell for cast time and mana efficiency with a few powerful cooldowns (Innervate, Battle rez, etc) - there's also a set bonus that lets you recoup mana from heals so you get pretty efficient too. Priests have a massive toolkit with options for every situation and are the AOE healers of choice for the alliance (shaman for the horde). Understanding what spell at what rank is optimal for the current situation can be overwhelming but also really rewarding once you master it. 
---
Priests will have an easier time finding raid spots since their versatility means you can always find a niche to squeeze in to. Druids have to contend with the stigma of being the ""worst"" healer which can make getting a spot more awkward, but every raid will want at least few Druids on hand for their CDs. (How relevant this paragraph is will depend entirely on how focused on optimisation your prospective group is)
---
that’s not what op asked.
---
Either do I

---
Tbh I dont even like being subbed to retail just for a chance to get into the bets for a game i want to play rofl
---
No way he goes alliance if one of the main people hes going to play with wants to be shaman though
---
Paladin by far. Or shaman spamming healing wave. But none is really that hard. Druid has the longest heals so you have to anticipate a bit more.
---
*takes his bow and leaves while muttering something about disturbing the peace with those pesky gun sounds*
---
In a raid you 100% need to be Holy.
---
In Dungeons you can be any spec you want and heal just fine.
---
Yes, two Shadow Priests is overkill. If you bring one, you bring one.
---
There was no macro for it. You invite someone to your party, promote them to leader and log out. While you are logged out, they kick you out of the group. Then you log in.
---
A macro is QoL convenience added by nostcore servers (it's not on some other servers).
---
Nope, it's an ugly cartoon rifle. 
---
Best looking is basic hunting style rifles for guns and any bow instead of gun.
---
I agree. We should never change our laws. Let us keep our gun laws from the 1700s and our immigration laws from the 1700s. Changing years don't change civic rights.
---
Haha this guy was my hero
---
I'm just not a huge fan of the way Blizzard is doing it. Blizzard is no indie company, there isn't a short of funds or people to do the work and this is what we are getting? There's a bunch of "We can't do pure vanilla because of this or that" what does that even mean? 
---
A company can't do again what they did 15 years ago?
---
I guess what I was expecting was a private server effect but on official blizzard realms with correct data and all that mumbo jumbo.
---
Nope
---
Worth reporting I guess
---
But only hunters can tame pets thats bummer. Maybe add cash shop with pets so every class can have them?
---
Yep, I timed my instant attacks to go off 21 seconds after pressing the button in some of the SS vs TM battles I had in Vanilla.
---
i hope this is a troll lmao
---
I mean, if you like pet battles why not simply log in Retail, do some battles and log back to Classic?

I remember respeccing and having to farm gold to respec more SEVERAL times to try different talents.
---
If I didn't get a free mount, I would have never got one.
---
The developers need to develop some balls and just release a new journey to 70. If Classic is successful, which it will be, I wouldn’t complain with them doing TBC but I honestly think they have a golden chance to create a new story. Change up how things play out in TBC and eventually Wrath. Blame it on Chromie. She messed with time and it had serious consequences moving forward. 
---
Keep some servers at 60 for the players who want stuff to stay at 60. But also create new servers with a new story that stays on Azeroth with the Classic gameplay and feel in mind. Add Jewelcrafting, the BC talent trees and maybe arena. However, I think not having flying mounts (or at the very least reduce the flying speed to 60% and 100-150%) would be really important to keeping the feel of Classic. Having everyone on the ground helps make the world feel a lot more alive. 
---
They could redo BC content on Azeroth. Kara, ZA, Caverns of Time. Introduce the Blood Elves and the Sunwell, the Draenei too, for balance. Maybe have some content, quests, dungeons or raids that send you through the Dark Portal but not to all of Outlands. 
---
They could also remake the zones from Cataclysm too. Maybe not Deepholm and Vasjir but definitely Hyjal, Twilight Highlands/Grimbatol and Uldum. Maybe even Tol Barad? They have a lot of real estate to play with. I have a hard time believing that they will remake WoW beyond Wrath content so none of those zones really matter. Plus, I don’t think many people have fond memories of those zones like they do for Duskwood, Westfall, Barrens etc. anyway...
---
The end of the expansion/leading into the next, we have to deal with another invasion from Arthas. Maybe he actually gains a foothold in Kalimdor or the EK and that’s where Wrath starts out; pushing him and the undead back to Northrend. 
---
It’s not going to happen but I would 100% prefer a new story/expansions with Classic gameplay in mind to simply just redoing BC and Wrath.
---
Good analysis, this is something that I had wondered too.
---
Although I agree with you, it's completely futile.
---
Too many douchebags. It's human nature, unfortunately.
---
&gt; Oh and by the way in case you're screaming at your screen going "there were no battle pets in vanilla!" There actually were battle pets, they just weren't considered battle pets, as much as random companions that would follow you around like for example the disgusting oozling, it was still a thing, and you would still look green from it, there just was no battle feature for it.
---
I'm well aware of these, that's why I said they'd be in your inventory.  Bag space was a huge balance factor, or at least mechanic that influenced gameplay in vanilla.  Making it so flavor items no longer took of some of that space reduces their value and skews the dynamic of the game.  It's not vanilla.
---
And before you assume again, I'm not a #nochanges purist, I'm happy to see most of the QoL changes they've decided to keep from the legion/BfA client.
---
I think they might keep Classic and Retail separate for two different game players
---
That one seems familiar from vanilla somehow. To me at least. Autoshot and aimed did have weird interactions.
---
If your have anything other than yourself targeted, your character no longer turns it's head or torso.
---
The people complaining don't even know what it's like at endgame yet. How gear drops are few and far and how your pre raid BiS is a very expensive and extremely long farmed set of crafted gear. It's a completely different game from anything post WotLK.
---
this was not in vanilla no.. you could not see who rolled what until the roll was over
---
Yes Classic rogues was exactly like that
---
Your entire account is trolling from calling the rain effect a "slippery slope" to trolling for changes like QoL.
---
I never used it in vanilla, but ive loved it when I used it.
---
Warfronts will be forgotten.
---
What are they going to do? Level someone on a different server for that sole purpose? Theres not much harm one can do unless they level to 60 which takes a ton of time just to mess with others. Then the second they start doing anything shitty the whole realm will know not to invite them to groups or interact with them. Streamer free servers aren't really necessary but that's not a realistic counterpoint. Why would anyone want revenge on others who just want a different server? And for the few that might do that, they cant do any significant harm
---
Gtfo alliance scum

Brian Birmingham said 3 days ago he's gonna look into it (in chat):
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/426169254?t=10h20m32s
---
Im gonna assume you're just a troll
---
This is essentially saying that having different servers will ruin STV
---
The short answer is yes, weapon damage is everything when levelling. If that means a staff is bis then go with it.
---
This video explains things really well - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Dn6X2QIZg
---
I played BfA for 12 hours a day first two weeks, look where that got us. It's way too early to tell.
---
Blizlike.
---
like experience for killing seems worse  in groups
---
I raided as Disc/Holy, but yeah. Shadow won’t cut it in raids.
---
"When I played before it was like this!" 
---
Clearly nothing the way it was in vanilla.
---
But like they're covering the aspects that make vanilla, vanilla. The ones that actually matter whatsoever for the experience.      
---
Like I don't think comparing to private servers is fair when they're not much better realistically speaking
---
this so much
---
Thanks! Is it not too dark? My screen looks amazing but it's a designer monitor. A friend said it was dark as shit for him
---
that makes it a bit clearer and increases my worry that day one will be a cluster fuck to get stuff done.
---
was debating taking a week off work but dont think i will waste the holiday time lol when i get home i may be able to get started if enough people have moved on to the next areas
---
Didn't one of the interviews say it wouldn't be pulling people into different layers randomly? Unless you join a group or whatever, since it was something like your layer is chosen on login
---
I hate to interrupt your rant, but u/aspire_rang is just trying to correct your misconception of free speech.
---
This one was nice too: https://classicdb.ch/?item=18755
---
Discovered it recently on a pserver
---
Thanks for posting this bud! I just had to see it. Kylierogue reporting.
---
have there not been any EU/Asia invites yet?
---
oh damn he got hit for 405. I don't think a chest piece would of saved him from that hit.
---
Bro, I remember having to wait 10 seconds  after looting before I could open the ingame map. It's like they didn't even play test thst shit.
---
In my opinion, there’s a big difference in having a community flock to a server and becoming its population and having a smaller streaming community being a part of a larger population.
---
Asmon and probably a couple others will have servers run by their viewers while other servers will be communities that happen to have streamers in them. 
---
Bottom line, though, I think every server - even the huge streamer ones - are going to be close to the same community experience for the most part. I don’t want to be a part of the streamer crowd, but the world of Azeroth is big and I don’t have to be. 
---
To your point, though, all servers are absolutely not going to be “streamer servers”.
---
There was no damage reducing interactions in vanilla apart from weapon skill/defense creating glancing blows for melees. However, ranged attacks cannot glance, so assuming you hit the mob, you will do full damage.
---
Wow, that comment chain could be its own damn thread. Good job guy
---
more like /r/posteverytimeastreamerfarts

Bought an ultrawide monitor today, only for classic wow immersion
---
This wins
---
True. The hardest part of KT was Sapphiron (and before that, the 4HM. "Just gear 8 warriors lul !").
---
The amount of farm needed for that boss was insane.    
---
I lost it but I had a screenshot of buff lines going offscreen with flasks and elixirs and potions and onyxia buff etc before the kill.
---
Such a relatable moment that everyone who plays has experienced at some point.

Come on by and say hi
---
I brought my loto ticket as well and all I have done is run MC BWL and AQ 40.... 
---
Thanks blizzard
---
no u
---
upvoted for homm3, what an absolutely brilliant game
---
Destiny’s point is that almost all economists vouch that it’s good for the economy and that we should be talking about managing the problems that come with it  instead of just not doing it. 
---
It’s a complicated issue, but there’s also a lot of “othering” that goes on because benefits of immigrants help the lower class indirectly which makes it look like they lose out of having it while everyone else benefits. 
---
Talk about integration and how to deal with cultural clash are also difficult, but a lot of people have fears that are way overblown compared to the situation. 
---
It’s a difficult topic and it’s one most productively had by staying calm.
---
it essentially has to be this way, their fear would have been they cant charge 15 a month for classic or it would fail
---
they also get to combine sub numbers in the share holder reports the  way its done now. 
---
it could not have been a purchase outright game because of servers monthly cost. I personally would have preferred a slightly cheaper sub just for classic but i pretty much understand why they did it this way
---
I can't tell you specifically why it won't work because I never played Shaman in Vanilla, but I'd say the evidence of 3 years and thousands and thousands of players coming before you attempting it suggests you're on a fool's errand.
---
Shamans are in raids for totems and off-healing. That's about it.
---
The reel is used no matter which class, [Jin'do's Judgement](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19884) and [Angelista's Grasp](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19388).
---
If we were to allow all the small changes that everyone wanted, we'd be getting tbc or wrath.. not classic
---
While reading through all of this, I forgot that I'm in r/classicwow, the whole comment section reads like some political subreddit.  
---
Guys, just saying the rules state   
---
3.3. - No witch hunts or brigading, which it kinda feels like when people push their agenda like this.  
---
5.5. - No real world politics or religion, which this definitely is....I'm surprised this whole comment chain remained around here despite rule 5. while perhaps maybe rule 3. does not apply here necessarily....definitely rule 5 though.
---
Downvoted for "unpopular" popular opinion.
---
&gt;20 big WoW streamers? Who? Sodapoppin, Asmongold, Lirik(?), and....?
---
Towlee, Venruki, Swifty, Preach, Chinglish, MethodJosh etc 
---
Like what's your criteria for a big streamer? people that pull thousands still have enough sway to influence things that happen on the server, I don't even watch WoW streams because I find most of them terminally boring and I can already start thinking of ones that have sizable followings that will either make things more interesting or less fun for the servers they pick.
---
Soda, Asmon etc are the outliers who have maintained -larger- followings, the rest still have big followings.
---
But it's safe to say most people interested in making just "content" will gravitate towards the streamer NA servers, but I've seen a lot of people express that it's already too crowded with just Asmon and Soda and will be spreading themselves abit thinner and will probably just leave alts/diff accounts on the big boy servers.
---
Like it or not classic is as much a spectator/streamer thing as it is an experience for you, just this time all the things you hate like phasing, lfg etc will work against anyone who doesn't want some disruptive 40man of twitchchat kids farming something for clout because a streamer told them too.
---
My advice? take the ping hit and roll EU or wait till they settle on other servers.
---
There was no armory back in vanilla
---
Just macro your stealth opener to pickpocket with autoloot first.
---
Haha I can see your physical appearance just from your toxic ass comment. Enjoy your hentai hahahahaha
---
Yeah great! How can't retail have no lag with these numbers..
---
From what Ive seen on reddit and people I know the only people that got a random invite were people from NA. Which is understandable since the servers are based there or there might be some other issue but so far I havent seen a single instance of a random(non-content creator or on F&amp;F list) that hasnt been from NA.
---
That comparison is absolutely stupid because a questhelper addon that other people are free to use won't interfere with your experience at all. You are hoping that other people don't have the choice to make their questing life easier. For what? It's impossible to notice whether they do anyway. That's elitist gatekeeping.
---
A dungeonfinder is something that effects every player and is noticeable no matter whether you use it yourself or not.
---
Low quality shit post.  
---
If you want toys and pet battles you have BFA.
---
I just hope I get to experience raiding finally with classic. I am a casual player doomed to lfr because I never had time to grind out the raid ready gear and in retail there’s always a has this iLvl and link achievement requirements to raid. I’m looking forward to a fresh start in classic. I know classic is more grindy but I hope having 40 mans will allow more non hardcore players to experience high end raiding.
---
&gt;Actually private servers are surprisingly accurate compared to the beta
---
And how would you know? From memory, like everyone else?
---
Bias and pride.
---
I'm right there with ya. I log in once a week to farm old mounts and such but otherwise, haven't really played in a couple of months. Just not interested in the current content.
---
Good for you I guess?
---
This. If a raid wants caster dps, they’ll bring a mage who can do it ten times better. 
---
Sorry, there’s a reason why they’re called memespecs.
---
fuck ALL "content" "creators"
---
thats tbc.  look at the water elemental..    i'm more surprised when i find animations and effects that are correct in the beta than are wrong
---
Compared. To. The. Beta. 
---
Are you retarded.
---
actiblizz is one of the biggest corporations in the absolutely massive gaming industry
---
if you don't think they have market analysts coming out of their asses, you're fucked
---
&gt;To me this is a clear sign that the quality of game development is going backwards. 
---
It's more that triple A games have been going backwards, and they have been going backwards for quite some time. Indie developers have more and more tools in modern times to create games, and are arguably more important to gaming now than ever before. However an indie developer releasing an MMO will always be challenging due to financial constraints, so I think that's why the MMO market quality is hit even more noticeably harder in comparison to other genres.
---
&gt; I know I might be overreacting by targeting the entirety of the game development industry but I'm sure most of you know what I'm talking about. 
---
It's not really an overreaction. It is what it is.
---
Or they have it followed with more RTS.
---
Because it does feel like a 3rd person Warcraft game, with the mechanics. It just doesn't work that way...
---
i need it too
---
If you plan a good route lvl 60
---
Realistically id say 45-50
---
Because people vote in line with their opinion.
---
In Dungeons and PVP (to an extent) yes. In raids no, unfortunately.
---
PvP in BfA is great.
---
You do realise that servers and bandwidth doesnt come free of charge right?
---
And there will also always be some form of GMs and other stuff needed.
---
It’s not like they can paint the wow classic painting, hang it on the wall and let people see it.
---
I don’t pay money to any streamers and honestly I could care less about playing with them. I would rather play with friends. Your just salty as fuck.
---
High 40’s if you rush. But don’t rush man enjoy it read the quest text. Learn the lore, it makes the game so much more meaningful if you know why your killing this mob or picking up that thing.
---
Makes me angry Tips is considered a big streamer
---
His stupid idiotic face as he realizes that he doesn't know shit about what he claims to be an expert on.
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
There wont be a wow 2 
---
look at what they have done to the story over the past what 3 expansions nothing even remotely makes any sense anymore
---
they can just make an expansion with a portal and take people back in time or change the world however they want its never stopped them before. 
---
I still find it weird how much they change classes every expansion every other mmo at least leaves classes similar or basically the same , i dont even know how to play any of the classes last time i logged into wow
---
Honestly though if they had someone with a really good vision they could make an excellent retail expansion without rolling everything back or making a new game
---
just like jump through a portal , fix as much as you can , have great game play lots of content , power fantasy , get rid of a lot of stuff people hate etc
---
Pls don't stop you are doing good work I appreciate it
---
Pretty sure his belief is that people like to see shit that annoys them, for entertainment. He talked two days ago about the “Howard Stern Effect”, where the average listener who enjoys Howard Stern listens for like 2 hours a day. The average Howard Stern hater then listens for 3 hours. Why? “To hear what he’s going to say next”
---
He knows just how toxic and immature a lot of his on-stream behaviour is, he does it for viewers and money and it works
---
no, its perfect !
---
Sounds like your mad you didn’t get in. Lol.
---
that video is tbc
---
wow! I just relieved so many old guild names I forgot about on my characters
---
that video is tbc tho.  shamans weren't on alliance in vanilla
---
I really thought about playing Witcher 3 lately. I never really got very far into it. I don't even remember why I stopped playing it. I've been so engrossed in Monster Hunter lately though that it's hard to pull myself away and boot it up though.
---
Any words of wisdom on how good it is? Maybe it will tip my scales.
---
good find
---
as a hunter main this will seriously piss me off if it doesn't get removed. That small delay could cause a lot of problems
---
When you spread misinformation or rhetoric that targets a minority group, you are actively harming that group, even if you’re not aware of it. Critical thinking is kind of an important skill to have.
---
Will be really hard to salvage the story though. I liked the approach Classic did to the story a lot more though than future expansions. Game stopped taking itself seriously in every way. Also I find personally that class design has become progressively worse starting at Cataclysm. Only reason expansions such as Legion and BFA had a lot of subscribers is due to that WoW was already big the product itself was / is largely outclassed by other MMOs on the market.
---
Well, since after a couple days you're going to be brain dead from the lack of sleep, I'd say not far. Have you and your partner tried going 6 days on 4 hours of sleep and had any success?
---
I think most hardcore players are going to reach 60 in 7-10 days /played. So at 120 hours, you might reach level 50 (which is about halfway to 60).
---
More realistic is 14 hour days or 84 hours total. That'll get you about 35% of the way to 60 or level ~45.
---
moonwalking is personally one of the most important things i think they need to get right..  moonwalking off after killing someone, or away from someone just put you so far above them and gave you a good feeling
---
It has come to my attention that some words in my last post were phased out. It was supposed to say:
---
"World PvP in Battle for Azeroth does not even support 80 characters and that is a shame for an online game that alledgedly is massively multiplayer. If Blizzard could fix it, that would be great."
---
Of course you needed to use the word "strawman" and repeating the word "hysterical" doesn't make you look better, neither does calling other people "triggered". Nothing of that is an argument, it is what people write when they do not have arguments. 
---
&gt; No one else cares
---
Wrong a lot of people care. That's why he got a lot of backlash everywhere.
---
&gt; he's a funny and entertaining guy
---
as long as he doesn't talk about politics, maybe, but since that is what he does all the time, his entertainment worth has gone to zero for a lot of people, me included.
---
&gt; all that matters
---
for most people is more than if someone can be entertaining at points. I watch him play a game and know at the same time he thinks about the "gene pool", "race" and "white genocide" and no I can watch a lot of entertaining people that do not have these views and give them my money and time.
---
&gt; There's nothing dangerous about his views or anyone agreeing with them. 
---
You either don't understand that he does repeat extremist viewpoints or you are having the same view on immigration, black people, race and more as them or maybe you just consume his gaming content and never watched him getting political.
---
I have said what I had to, to make my point and you clearly have nothing to say anymore either besides the word "hysterical". Have a nice day.
---
No. Noone knows anything. There's a high probability that more waves of invites will go out, but noone knows jack sh\*t :p
---
That's why we need to promote this website. I've been able to reconnect with one guildy but i'm sure many others are planning to play. Start by putting yourself on it and others will follow.
---
agro range is very low across the board. you basicly have to give the orcs in redridge a kiss for them to attack you
---
i wonder if unstuck free hearth works? 
---
that worked in vanilla right but they patched it out of retail
---
i forget how the exact mechanic works i think the modern version just takes you to the nearest graveyard?
---
Low effort troll.
---
I mean, the first month of warfront was extremely fun, but it just got more and more faction imbalance as people stopped playing after the initial rush.
---
Actually I don‘t care about the micro transactions except of the level boosts. Let people buy their mounts and pets if they want. I don‘t care. But let the game philosophy like it was in classic and tbc
---
No problem, good luck. Don't forget to put yourself on there and motivate others to do the same thing. The more people are on there the more likely it will be that you find more people.
---
Awesome!
---
Why should I forget shockadin? That was my only hope of being able to output some decent damage in PvP while also still being specced for healing :( 
---
I'm willing to go through this grind just cos I love the armour sets, and also try something different as a healer
---
&gt; Using the shadow priest talent tree build, can I still be a useful healer in a raid?
---
&gt; is having 2 shadow priests overkill in the raid environment?

Deathly afraid, I cannot for the life of me decide on a character despite playing tons of hours on an instant 60 server over multiple classes
---
He should play PvE then, because he won’t get anything done in the world at this rate.
---
Yes, someone knows. Doubtful anyone lurking here knows though.
---
I've tested this on a P-server with a Night Elf. And I got to level 5 in about 1 hour. With FP's for Rut'theran Village, Auberdine, Menthil Harbour, Thelsamar, Ironforge, Stormwind, Lakeshire, Darkshire &amp; Sentinel Hill.   
---
I only plan on doing this in case with the layering questing becomes very crowded. Because usually questing the starting zones is faster and more enjoyable.
---
seems like a really cool thing. makes me wonder why so many people hated the level cap increase of TBC
---
I'm pretty sure it was a magic based debuff
---
The subscription fee is there to cover the costs before and after development. It includes a whole lot more than server upkeep, and it makes perfect sense that a game as a service will require a subscription model. 
---
As for content: Blizzard will either create new content, or rehash the other expansions. 
---
If you listen to the podcast interview on Countdown to Classic the guy who wrote Wow Diaries states that he’s sure Blizzard has a plan for Classic and future content. Hell they’ve even said so themselves in so many words.
---
Do you think they’re going to stop streaming when the game releases on August 26th?
---
Me too! Help spread the word!
---
I agree, this website really is all about visibility for it to become even greater.
---
I literally need to buy a computer and a desk/chair so plenty of preparations needed.
---
Is the unstuck function working like it was in vanilla?
---
Start by adding yourself to the list and others will follow! These reddit threads will be inactive in a couple of days.
---
Horde scum is pure evil and must be purged from the lands..
---
Yes we already did it. 
---
Thanks hope we will be at least 47+
---
It's not because people connect with old friends they won't be open to make new friends. Classic vibe is a lot different than retail. Just explore the world and be friendly.
---
Reconnect and relive old moments!
---
If you look into the lore you can actually argue that the horde were the good guys
---
Most of the best pvp gear is in the raids... they will be raiding
---
damn, I wasn't really much of a TB fan but thinking about that actually makes me sad as fuck.
---
Don't act like LFG add-ons didn't exist in vanilla
---
You misjudged.
---
Hitlerlaughing.jpg
---
Swear it used to be green
---
YouTube, Twitter, etc. isn't the government. They can sensor anyone they want and free speech still stands.
---
too soon
---
&gt; As far as i know classic will not be updating or patching anything at all, 
---
Untrue, they will patch.  
---
Also phase released content. requires some devs too...  
---
&gt; why are they asking for a subscription for that? 
---
You dont have to (re-)buy the game.  
---
Its only a monthly fee.  
---
Infrastructure and GM's and Dev teams isnt free you know.  
---
&gt; For people who only want classic they should just introduce a buy for 30$ or whatever price with no subscription model. While still keeping classic "free" for retail subscribers.  
---
So..... if i still pay the monthly fee , nothing changes ?  
---
The only thing you want to see here is, that you can Buy classic......  
---
Kinda get it, but from a money making perspective , customers attached to a subscription model is the best choise.
---
&gt; 15$ a month for nothing  
---
Your vision is so clouded.   
---
it's the gameplay, the experience and a lot, you probably won't understand, because your opinion is already so prejudiced
---
She has been told that I will take a weeks vacation when it launches and that we will not see each other that week (we live like 10 mins walking from each other) - her response: No problem. 
---
Keeper.
---
Yeah, honestly I see it as low intelligence. I don't even mean this as the typical "yeah, screw all the Classic haters" way, but honestly, people that think it's just nostalgia are basing it off of their own opinion. They can't understand why anyone would play it because they don't like it themselves.
---
Being unable to understand things outside your own personal emotions / opinions is generally seen as pretty low intelligence.
---
Asmon as well all get to witness him on his stream is 100% a character he developed and plays for the streaming, his job.
---
Retard or troll.. gg
---
21h after this post we are missing 400 from 100k, so pretty much called it. How many were there when you posted this?
---
Vanilla unstuck just ported you a few yds to the left or right didn’t it? Remember using it to get behind org AH back in the day
---
Afaik he also stated he plans on playing on a pve server
---
Speaking of wish lists...
---
An addon that shows the resist values of the targeted mob.
---
An addon that tracks duration of your spell effects, putting the timer lines so you can see how much time is left on that CC.
---
An addon that puts numbers on your abilities, so you can see exactly how much that extra +2% crit on a new item affects your average damage.
---
Actually the MVP was not Venruki but that beast warrior SONY DIGITAL.  Sony charges in first causing focus on him, Sony targets and slows Asmon down and he finishes him off.  He is the true champ
---
Joanas record was 4 days 20 hours /played, if you did 15 hours a day that would be about a week of playing, so yeah, it was probably more like two weeks. For the world record.
---
wow! I just relived so many old guild names
---
LMAO have fun NA with the streamer servers
---
I'm with you, I would rather get corpse camped for hours than play PvE. I played BfA a lot at release and never once turned off warmode for that same reason. The world feels too stale and 'safe' to me without the looming threat of other players. But hey, each to their own.
---
You also get better gear, some copper and you learn your level 2 and 4 abilities right away which you cant if you do an explore run on a fresh server since you need some money to learn the skills.
---
But an explore run gives you the flight paths and isn't based on spawns, so you can skip the starting zone and have better transport to your flight paths which may save on time lost.
---
That's why I would love to see someone testing it on beta, I prefer to have a backup plan.
---
take a look on the guild recruitment discord and there at tonnes of pvp guilds advertising for recruitment already, with raids times set. All good PvP guilds will raid too, for BiS items, as well as PvP.
---
Just play the game and learn while playing it.
---
Having a good group of friends to play regularly, and chat with, also improves your experience.
---
Having transitioned from RS to WoW myself, back in 2007, you need to understand they're VERY different games, be prepared to not make direct comparisons, the quest systems differ tremendously, the combat, professions/skill etc, basically nothing is comparable.
---
Because spells and effect in retail are much more complex, spells resolve faster and position is tracked more precisely.
---
Yea pvp server really means Pve server with added benefit of world pvp.
---
you can pretty much do any 5 mans as shadow, but not raid. You'd need to raid as Holy.
---
Arena is for many on the same list as flying mounts, group finder etc. Maybe a bit lower on the list, but it is generally credited as being a big part of PvP downfall. This is mostly because it kickstarted a whole new aspect of balancing. Now it was about 3v3 so naturally battlegrounds and openworld were hard to keep balanced when the focus was 3v3. Add in that for a long time they also had to balance it without ruining PvE.
---
I will play only one class no twinks no bank char and yes i am ok with this
---
I can feel his pain.
---
What a clown
---
I don't think most people even have a clue what the cataclysm story is about. The game doesn't tell anything and you suddenly have to fight bosses again that were killed in vanilla WoW. I think a pretty big flaw that started here was making the players the hero and kind of ending the concept of an open world, except the player had no real character development within the game and there was no real story within the game. You sometimes read about the story somewhere else but not inside the game. 
---
Also the serious tone progressively got less serious with each expansion. For example some zones like plaguelands in classic had pretty interesting themes surrounding them and wasn't filled with a meme or pop culture reference every other quest.
---
It was about equal. Alliance just sucks. I mean like, who tf would play on the same team as humans. Cishets probs
---
His use of racial and homophonic slurs? If there is another comment that you feels violated our rules, please report it so the mods can review it. 
---
We do not have the ability to read every comment in every thread, and rely on reports to find what needs to be removed.
---
The fact that it still isn't across multiple servers or can teleport you to the dungeon/raid is important though, I don't see it taking off
---
I posted asking about this months ago because I feel it is so important and no one believed me haha. Thank you for highlighting this, hero!
---
Pet control used to be sooooo fun but now it’s clunky :( hopefullly we get it back! (Its especially important with intimidation)
---
The people posing as classic community members while what they actually want is an alternative progression path past classic Naxx are annoying as it is.  
---
The actual classic community is not interested, please create your own alternate progression community.
---
I understand that. I just don't get why these things are more important then playing without lag.
---
No! But there will be alot more people streaming, like bfa and all other games. Streamers will always have effect the game. The problem right now is that all beta keys are in the hands of big streamers.
---
in current definition, yes they can as they are private platforms with control over what they display, but that may have to be changed with those platforms frequently being used for political views.
---
it's also good practice to not discriminate based on political opinion as you'll start a pr disaster for your company if you ban someone simply based on their political views.
---
It does it you have 10m people subbed as opposed to 2m. They didn't need mtx before because they made bank from sub fees alone.
---
Unless it's a TN panel, there's most likley some form of ghosting.
---
You may not see it in WoW though as it's not a fast paced game.
---
I actually prefer the Core Marksman Rifle. Its much more *immersive* and *realistic* or whatever!
---
on PVP servers there will be alot of PVE.  
---
the PVP type server is there to state, if you want to attach the opposing faction, if you encounter them in the world.  
---
I  even think the most and highest PVEers are on PVP servers
---
I understand the necessity of bug reporting for the beta and getting the classic experience right, but these twats that are just like "yeah this isn't how I remember it, must be a bug" shouldn't be in the beta.
---
What class? You can reach 60 if you already know what to do and have a good duo composition, if you are going blind i'd say around lvl 50.
---
That is something only a supervillain would say..
---
But it is even broken in the live game.
---
ModUI pls
---
&gt;Ganking players half your level isnt exactly "world pvp". 
---
Based on what definition of world PvP? Yours?
---
It is not a *fair fight,* sure - but who said world PvP has to be fair? What if it is a 3v1, isn't that world PvP? Or what if someone vastly outgear the other, is that not world PvP?
---
To me world PvP is exactly what it says, me fighting other players in the world. It is often not fair, which is exactly why I find it so much more enjoyable than a battleground or arena.
---
And honestly, getting to 60 fast and start harassing the enemy faction is not just pointless trolling, slowing down the enemy factions leveling can as a whole help your own faction.
---
Maybe off topic but god damn hes right, I was planning on maining a tauren druid but they are so ugly I don't think I can do it. Night elf it is.
---
I'd rather have a new game with classic principles. just leave classic classic.
---
or an alliance scum bag.  
---
FOR THE HORDE !
---
Jeez, this sub has a rage boner against streamers. When you have one good place to direct your rage (i.e. a legitimate dirt bag) y'all defend him. Shame on you hate mob.
---
Considering that private servers can already scratch that itch for Classic, I don't get why people are squirming for the release. There's a good chance you're going to over hype yourself and suffer from burn out as a result. Chill out my dudes.
---
Yeah, very true. However there are few pick up and delivery quests you do during that run. So you do have some coppers to spend at the end of the run, to buy your spells.
---
they can erase the story post wrath and make it alternate timeline thing.
---
It's entirely possible
---
Sad that people make a big deal about some guy's ininformed opinions from 2 years ago. Clearly the guy is not a racist, he believed some stupid articles and has been proven wrong in an unexpected debate with someone who regularly did debates on youtube/twitch but I believe he learned a lesson and his opinions have changed by now.  
---
Call me an apologist fan but I stll love our Jonny boy and I'm glad he has taken a step back and is focusing in his channel.
---
My first is due not long after release. I'm sure I'll be able to balance it, more responsibilities than when I started.
---
with the incredible amounts of inconsistencies, bugs, wrong effects and animations there needs to be as many people in the beta as possible..   it looks like the majority that includes the player characters are wrong and are using the modern equivalent
---
Oh well adblock is a thing that majority of people (that I know at least) use, so even if the site was riddled with ads it wouldn't be an issue :D I mean the websites have to make money somehow.
---
It's known.
---
Exactly. And we still did fine without a "High King".
---
1280x1024 is not 4:3 though.
---
I found a guild before launch for a few reasons. First is that I've tried messing around on pservers and believe me after hitting level 30 on both H and A without interacting with another soul is very demoralising, now I totally believe that retail vanilla will be better and people will be way more friendly, but it's nice to know that I'll definitely have a place to hang out and chat while I'm flying from Org to TB or waiting for the Zep. It also means that there will always be people to ask for help with a quest or find a group, or people asking for my help.
---
Secondly, I already know that I want to do some casual raiding and it suits me to find a group of like minded people who I already know share the same goal as me. As we get to know each other and level together that is part of the fun and means if we hit difficulties during raids we can laugh it off cos we are all friends. 
---
I was also stuck between a couple of classes, I found a guild who I really liked the sound of and it turns out they only needed one thing and not the other, so it kinda made up my mind for me which I'm ok with.
---
Thanks yeah got mixed up.
---
If you liked Mass Effect for the story, I'd recommend Dragon Age Origins. I'm replaying it now, and it's sooo nice. Just save often, the transition to modern Windows was not kind to it.
---
they have good and bad people in the horde, as do the alliance, but unlike the alliance the horde were less xenophobic than the alliance and were mostly just looking for some where to settle in peace. as much as i love the horde and have mained horde since vanilla i wouldn't say either side were the good guys they each have their one agenda that the other side may see as evil or bad. and some people on each side were just down right evil but mostly due to corruption or infiltration.
---
He's making fun of J. Allen Brack (however his name is spelled).
---
Or the equally toxic "____ streamer isn't spending their time in beta they way I want them to therefore they don't deserve beta".
---
But we don't care about the live game here.
---
you should just stay in your starting zone till its time to move on to the Barrens. Then head to the Crossroads. From there you can quest together. Shouldnt take longer than a few hours / say an evening, to get to a level where you can both just quest together.
---
\&gt;He knows that by calling vanilla WoW a joke, he pushes the buttons of certain people
---
I think he knew what he was doing there, he's a sarcastic fuck and to be honest that's why I like watching him.
---
Reading the detailed loot information again, it doesn't say that you see what other people chose on the item. It says the detailed loot information would show you all the rolls. Not what people chose before the roll happened.
---
Humans dont know what they want.  We just guess.
---
Well I guess in context I havn't joined a guild in years and have been playing solo in retail for a long time. Don't really need to keep up with anyone so I just quest and gear myself up at my own pace.  
---
If I manage to find a nice guild and a bunch of people to play with I might be playing more on Classic but we'll see. Still pretty excited for the release.
---
 [https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=33403](https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=33403) look at one of the comments on this vid (**06-12-23 21:06**): "Enter at the water fall. You could cut of some time if you changed the order you kill them in. Don't think Satyr is worth the time. Landslide, Princess, tinker and then end with rotgrip. Should be 12-15min per run **and you can reset instance by inviting someone, promote them and leave the party and logout/in and start right back at the waterfall**."

&lt;We Got Old&gt; \[**US**\] \[**Horde**\] \[**PVP**\]
---
**Introduction**: We are a collaboration of various friend groups, with the core of us playing WoW together since original vanilla (Darkspear-US) that have been gaming together for 15+ years. As of right now, before recruiting any strangers, we have a roster of 17 solid members. 90% of us have raided both in vanilla and on private servers. We are looking for any amount more who'd like to commit and get to know us during the 3 months we have before launch. We plan on doing the rest of the recruitment by leveling quickly and recruiting people we meet along the way while acquiring pre-raid BiS.
---
**Discord**: Rick#4805
---
**Realm** : US - High Pop Server preferred
---
**Realm Type**: PVP
---
**Faction**: Horde
---
**Region**: US
---
**Time zone**: EST-PST
---
**Guild Type**: Hardcore to Semi-Hardcore
---
**Loot Rules**: DKP
---
**Raiding Times**: 2 Weeknights, raid times still undetermined
---
**Intention**: We will prioritize raiding above all else. Initial 3-6 weeks spent leveling and getting pre-bis
---
**What We Expect Of Members**: We expect our members to level fast. The core of us will all be level 60 within 3 weeks and expect everyone to hit that point within a month.
---
I was asking other partnered streamers on Twitch tonight, there's a few that said they got it this weekend, so there's still hope. But probably not much hope =/
---
Even tho i agree that there is a high chance that it wont work or work but not good enough, i have not found any evidence of anyone attempting exactly what i am suggesting. Attempting to dps in many different ways sure but i have not seen any elemental melee staff shaman like in mine.
---
Even if they are meme tier it means that everyone will underestimate you! Then when you school them you'll make a name for yourself!
---
I got the explanation that it promoted drug use aswell.
---
Which has nothing to do with Jontron.
---
Only good thing about this was that the servers didn’t crash.
---
Otherwise no one cares...
---
Alliance fanbois where you at 4Head
---
I tried Elder Scrolls Online recently. Being a huge Elder Scrolls nerd, I mostly jumped into it to see if the storytelling was good. I have a myriad of complaints about the game (class selection, graphics style, interface) but what stood out most to me was the intense isolation you feel. You are walking around with your level 3 "Dragon Knight" (there's no option to play a Warrior for some reason) passing by dozens of AFK or  at least silent max-level decked out shiny characters... after playing for a good 10 hours, I never had any conversations with anyone in that game. Even current WoW is better, but in the past it was truly great in that regard.
---
if only /u/notalexensual was half as good
---
Streamers have big egos so they'll probably want their own servers so they don't have to share.
---
is it common to switch specs back and forth?
---
This is dissapointing that it has persisted this long. 
---
Heres to them being more responsive to fixing it for Classic.
---
Yes its coming in the same patch as transmog!
---
Art least Tyrande wasn't standing around in high heels next to her significant other who lets people come in and beat her to death without lifting a finger. That's enough for me.
---
As a longtime retail player I can't wait for Classic. I don't hate BFA (though it's a disappointment for me) but I'm super excited for the option to return to the old style of WoW. 
---
They really are two completely different games that focus on entirely different things. I see myself playing both for that reason. Practically apples to oranges in my eyes.
---
Yes - they’ll be the 3 most played classes.  
---
If you want to ‘counter’ all 3 at once, not really possible, I suppose your best bet is a hunter.
---
but no one ran 1280x960
---
Other than the drama between reddit,players and the admin on those realms, it was a pretty awesome experience. And everything was 100% vanilla from start to finish and it was awesome. Years ago when we first asked for vanilla realms to be brought back online, we were all wanting VANILLA wow servers and for awhile we all thought that's what we were getting.
---
But, from the looks of this horrific beta, We are getting Retail with a vanilla skin, with some mechanics removed.  The huge deal breakers for me on retail was sharding and the dungeon/raid finding systems. We are getting sharding again, regardless of what people think, "layering" IS sharding. And it's a MASSIVE disappointment for me and doesn't allow me to get as nearly excited as I'd like to be.
---
From how the beta is looking at this very minute, Private servers will 110% still have a reason to be around. :)
---
4HM is a funny thing to me. I hear "8 warriors" so much but for some reason inside my head i have 6 warriors and two range tanks for one of the Horses. I can't remember clearly because I was just a healer but I'm fairly sure we used range DPS on one of the horsies... :D
---
I watch nearly every video on youtube with 2x playback speed. The amount of information per minute you get from a video has declined.
---
You're unironically dumb if you think a single guy ruined the whole game.
---
If you think that's proof of him thinking coloured people are inferior to white people, then you simply lack basic reading comprehension.
---
Those sentences read (and sound, when listening to the audio), that Jontron is just adressing the fact that if two races completely assimilate and start making children with each other, they will eventually meld into one race, making the entire frame of the argument Destiny is putting up a moot point. Doesn't matter which race is the hypothetical "problem", they would both meld together. Which is why it's a pretty stupid question.
---
Can you SJW/Liberals/Democrats ever just steer clear from your baseless political and social bullshit? Just because JonTron has differing viewpoints and opinions than you, does not make him a racist. Just because you don’t like someone doesn’t make them a racist, bigot, or homophobic. And another note, pointing out factual statistics doesn’t make someone a racist.
---
EU dont get in unless your a streamer or a streamer sends your btag to blizz.
---
If what you're looking for is "good looking" frames and not functional ones we're not looking for the same product bro. lol
---
Simple is generally easier and faster to recognize. You don't need fancy shades to your class colors or fancy borders lol
---
&gt; **but Vanilla wPvP was made for streaming** 
---
i can tell you its not.  
---
When Vanilla was released, there was no such thing a streaming at the level we have it now.
---
if you didn't pay back in vanilla you may not know but we didn't have a pet window back then all pets were stored in banks or bags, imagine having to store all your pets like that again just for pet battles, or are you asking if they could put in the pet window like it is in retail? can throw the mounts in with that, and the transmog for fun. at this point you may as well play retail, i'm not a purist and agree some QoL changes are welcome but things like pet battles while fun don't belong on a classic server
---
That's probably because the major community for Vanilla theorycrafting, Elitist Jerks, is no more. You might be able to scour their forums on archive.org, but it would be ugly.
---
What's more likely? That literally none of millions of Vanilla players and private server players have thought of your idea OR that your idea won't work well enough to be viable?
---
**After reading the whole comment chain**
---
"So anyway... what class are you guys planning on rolling?"
---
Assuming enough people get to STV level range and above while layering is switched on? This is a non issue.
---
I took a look over there not long ago and they seem pretty happy about Classic as well.
---
Honestly, it's just that most of them aren't likeable. I follow plenty of streamers in other games I've played, but the Classic lineup is just full of dudebros and manchildren. I can't watch most of them for two minutes without getting annoyed. There's a few that are fine, but they're the minor streamers like Perplexity and Monkeynews so people don't post their highlights and such. Instead this place is (and probably will continue to be) flooded with cringeworthy crap from Asmon and Tipsout, neither of whom have any kind of camera charisma at all.
---
I can’t believe this shit is fucking upvoted. Regardless of how you feel, the burden of proof is on Jontron not on the person who said what he said wasn’t true.
---
Classic - home. At least it was before Blizzard fucked everything up.
---
&gt; The MMO/expansion paradigm is flawed to begin with.
---
Have you seen how this is handled in FFXIV, for example? They don't seem to just obsolete content this way. You actually have to go through the _endgame_ of each expansion before you can even access the next one; new quests often send you to old locations and instances; there are incentives for high-level players to help low level ones (and to be challenged along the way thanks to level sync).
---
Not saying that their implementation is perfect but I wouldn't discount the idea of MMO expansions completely just because WoW does it very badly.
---
&gt; Just before everyone got separated into different shards
---
Except this doesn't happen cause raids.
---
Well they made the titanforging garbage system and LFR, so all the loot feels unrewarding now, and you are not really hyped for items as much because some dude only having done LFR can potentially get better gear than your item you got from mythic content. It's just laughable how they ever allowed that to be a thing. Also the fact that an item is almost never BiS because it's not max ilvl cos of said titanforging, or it doesnt have a socket.
---
You are the bomb!
---
I just want sexymap. lol
---
So my crappy memes get deleted by mods within minutes but this flamewar stays up for hours.
---
Yeah, okay.
---
Hey, also played alliance on kil jaeden for a while.
---
Who were you?
---
The new stock frames have buffs and debuffs. Have you not watched the beta?
---
found the Quinn fanboy
---
hunter pets will be 1.12 and all normalized. no special unique versions.
---
don't know the druid answer
---
Kind of depends on the political opinion.  For example coming out anti genocide is never a bad thing.
---
&gt; where he argues against immigration
---
Oh no!
---
Dude, just go make a Tumblr post to let that steam off lol.
---
Also interested in this, can't think of any but would like to know before I roll.
---
Hey Blizzard take notes. That's all it takes for your games to be great instead of modern generic cookie cutter bullshit
---
Lol @ streamers inventing WoW world PvP in 2019
---
Average for me was 180ms I'm pretty sure.
---
We never had open immigration
---
Warrior can take mage?  I really hope you’re not insinuating a Warrior has an advantage when fighting a mage.  It’s literally the single hardest counter in the entire game in favor of the mage.
---
I will be distancing myself from you
---
he cast 3 spells, relax ;d
---
I dunno why but I prefer the classic rifle, something like the gun from vanilla cinematic.
---
Very true, I cannot wait for Classic in all honesty, it looks fantastic.  
---
I just notice a trending fakeness on certain bit streamer of wow and classic
---
same, feels like an item from a cosmetic cash shop in a korean MMO
---
What is the purpose of warfront? I can't imagine fighting PVP type battles with PVE enemies. This shows the type of players that are there in WOW today.
---
Are you retarded? How would you know? If you know it's accurate compared to the beta then you're implying you know every value of vanilla.
---
Ah yes authentic private servers with their dynamic respawns, incorrect armor and resistance values, inflated drop values for lower levels (pretty sure this is a thing), incorrect pet summoning for locks (might be messing this one up, I forget if the pet disappears on private servers or not), certain mobs NOT USING THE ABILITIES THEY HAVE.         
---
Layering is a form of sharding sure, but it's one that's much more manageable and assuming we can take their word for it, itll be there for a few weeks (rather deal with this than absurdly fast respawns).         
---
Kinda curious what mechanics they cut?
---
I just watched the links and the first two are the same delay in attack.  The vanilla wow clip he clicks it like 4 times, but from the first click it's basically the same delay.
---
Your statement was that private servers are more accurate than beta. It seems reasonable to assume that when you said "more accurate" you meant that they more closely resemble WoW in 2004-2006 than the Classic Beta. So then the question of "how do you know"? Is asking how you know what WoW was like in 2004-2006 since it's been well over a decade since you could have possibly played it. Maybe you meant more accurate to something else, something you can actually compare against today?
---
Shhhhh... don’t have a differing opinion than the SJW/Leftist mindhive. Don’t think for yourself. That is against the law. The PC Police will downvote you. Violent crime statistics are just racist!
---
This is one of the lore things I'm most eager to get back to. No more mirroring the horde power structure because the writers are lazy.
---
&gt; Don't try to literally use it on your lap
---
Oh, so completely defeating it's literal namesake.
---
You get to a point where it's not much less of a hassle for me to just toss my tower in the truck when I go out of town and hook it up to the hotel TV, if I have to have a dedicated cooling pad, mouse, separate keyboard because I can't keep the LAPTOP in my LAP.
---
So yeah, "gaming laptop" is to a certain degree, an oxymoron.
---
I resubbed
---
Bought $700 worth of statues from the gear store
---
Linked my partnered Twitch account
---
Bought packs on Hearthstone even though I don't play
---
All in hopes of an invite, none yet. 
---
I even logged into the trash that is BFA hoping that might trigger something too.
---
Too bad it won't be possible live because of layering
---
Yeah imagine being one of the top guilds on your server and sitting back and watching the opposing faction takes the drakes off you. like lmao, does this sound like ordinary behaviour to you? That's cucked as fuck.
---
Planning to play Classic WoW **during** traditional working hours?
---
Consider joining [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowoffhours/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowoffhours/)
---
Flex-time workers, 2nd shift workers, 3rd shift workers, retirees, the self-employed, and others, please help us come together so that we can join the same server/servers when the time comes.
---
Yeah, and how would you know? Watching streams I've already noticed tons of things that were obviously wrong on private servers, from mob patrols to spawns to drop rates to spell and ability behaviour.
---
Yeah, because TFTs back in the time where mostly 5:4 with 1280x1024 as native resolution. Doesn't matter that much with a CRT.
---
I've heard Asmon at least say he's not going to accept freebies on the live version of the game, but I wonder how long thats going to last. I think he's just too used to people walking up to him and just handing him gold or rare items.
---
Blastershot launcher would like a word
---
It really isn't. 
---
Was trying random BG after not having played PvP for some months, it was a really boring experience with healers never losing mana or dying.
---
They keep making the same mistake of having trinkets that make you unkillable (diamond prism), this has happened many times so far. Made watching arena tournament boring as hell when you wait till 40% dampening.
---
It was so bad they had to add some weird ass trinkets that does damage and applies a healing absorbtion lol.
---
It just turned into some boring slow-paced PvP now
---
&gt; ingame API used and Macro building for example.
---
Aren't those purely by virtue of the old client though, rather than the servers themselves?
---
Not unless you’re keen on farming gold constantly.
---
I hope this is a cruel joke
---
Their egos would never allow that. They'll want to be THE streamer of the server. Plus the logistics of it are unfeasible.
---
I doubt this very much. Most of the workload is in the graphical elements.  
---
I've got it running on a 2018 Mac Mini and it's blisteringly fast. BFA barely runs on the same Mac.
---
download the pokemans app that’ll do the trick
---
Holy shit YES! Thanks!
---
They can't all fit on one realm. Take Asmongold, he has like 50k viewers at a time, right? If we say half of those are diehard fans who would definitely try to roll on the same server, and we assume that his streaming hours are when they'd be playing, we're already at like 10x server capacity just from one single streamer's community. And while he's a lot bigger than most of the others, any group of even just one or two thousand will completely take over a realm to the point where it instantaneously dies if the streamer leaves and most of the fans follow.
---
surely some pets will have faster attack speeds than others though correct? Otherwise the only viable pet would be a wing serpent then..
---
It’s not true. It’s level 51+. Maybe even higher but not sure.
---
What do you consider to be racist about these statements?
---
&gt;But it does have something to do with race, because on a national level, black commit more crime than other races. I know what you are saying, and agree with that point, it really does not matter, but statistically speaking, blacks commit more crimes than other races nationally.
---
So you agree that crime rates can be predicted by socio-economic status but don’t acknowledge that black people are worse off on average or am I reading this wrong?
---
&gt;It can't be determined from this data, but where ever Jon got his info that rich blacks commit more crimes than poor whites, it would potentially be feasible considering that blacks in general commit more crimes, yet they make up far less of the overall population than whites, so if you are using averages based on the entire population, it could make sense.
---
Again, black people are poorer on average so it would make sense that they commit more crimes.
---
Is it not true though?
---
Its okay to not like him, or think other people must have a loose screw for liking him, but Asmon definitely has charisma.
---
1. why wouldn't it?
---
2. layering will probably only be active for a few weeks
---
It's not TBC actually. This vid was made just after BC launch ***but*** had some late vanilla clips in it ; it's the case in this clip, he had a water elemental because new BC talents were there at the very end of Vanilla, during BC prepatch. There were no lvl 60 Alteracs just after launch because everybody was leveling. Vurtne in particular has his XP capped, so he doesn't have the BC expansion pack on this clip. Hence why I say it's late Vanilla :)
---
Not true. I've got Classic running on a 2018 i5 Mac Mini and it's fast. BFA barely runs at all.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ͜ʖ ͡°)ʖ ͡°)ʖ ͡°)
---
Fandral is the archdruid of the Cenarion Circle, not the leader of the  night elves per se.
---
Sorry babe, the guy literally talked about “gene pools” on stream, he’s a racist. LOL.
---
Be that as it may. It is still a difference where Classic will work in a different manner than Original vanilla and private vanilla servers.
---
I think a lot of streamers feel like they need to be seen as an expert and to be submitting bug reports to validate themselves.  
---
Submitting bogus bug reports just waists development time, what a tool.
---
As is their democratic right?
---
I mean the Alliance in Classic WoW is also super weakend and in no position of beeing the predators in the conflict right now.
---
You should care when it is an unfixed bug that spans multiple expansions and the current live game. Abit hard to expect or think it'll be magically fixed just for Classic.
---
"OK" "have" "a" "nice" "day" "friend" ":)"
---
Sums up how I feel about it pretty well.
---
Something that staysafe pointed and I think he makes a point is that in the end every server will have a streamer.  
---
It's pretty easy to stream nowadays even with a shitty computer especially on a 14 years old game not very demanding resource wise.  
---
Eventually, some people will stream on their server because since they no-life they might as well try to make a little money with it, or interact with other players from the same realm on their chat.  
---
Classic is very much realm-based, we'll hopefully have realm forums back so advertising for your stream will be easy.  
---
I played 14 years ago, enjoyed the hell out of world pvp but when I saw that Venuki squad flank I was amazed.  
---
It seems to be an unpopular opinion to most of you but Pvp wise having someone pushing R14 organizing pvp events on their stream is gonna be great, it will actually reinforce the community and push those events that not so many of us joined from the forums.  
---
I'm not talking about streamers with tens of thousands of viewers as I know there won't be any on my french server, but someone leading us to fight the opposite faction as a War Chief when he's on his R11 pushing for R12 is going too feel great.  
---
And the disappearance of someone like this won't lead to the desertion of a realm, just to another person taking the lead of those events.   
---
And come on, a battle video with like 10 different views from each faction is gonna be unreal.  
---
Don't be so pessimistic, we finally got Classic back we're gonna relive our childhood's adventure and whatever happens it will be EPIC.
---
Can you control the prio debuffs appear in?
---
Shrink and expand them/ Because if I can't 40 man raid frames are a mess and hp bars need to be very wide to accommodate all 16 debuff slots to make sure important ones aren't getting cut off. 
---
Do i get complete control of frame size and ratios/ Can I set up easy click casting? Does it have healcomm integration?
---
And no I haven't watched the beta I have private servers. I've seen leveling to 30 before lol i'll pass.
---
Almost nothing at that level really matters at all. The most interesting info in the beta for me will be things like backfire rates on engi items relative to p servers. Anything else I have literally no desire to go seek out the info. 
---
I would bet a large sum of money the default frames in classic will not be as good as the luna on p servers.
---
Absolutely yes. Encountering an opposite faction raid group making their way to the same instance you're going to is one of the best moments in vanilla wow. Blackrock mountain is one of the most infamous warzones for that reason.
---
Best bet would be to download the Twitch app and open it via that. Works every time for me.
---
I would not consider Staysafe and Tipsout ‘’streamers’’ lol
---
Psychic Scream is a 26s CD.  I would have seen you WotF.  I have a shield, HoT, multiple survivability buffs, and my own trinket.  Eventually you're getting feared into mobs.
---
Lot of assumption in your post that everyone you will fight is going to suck.
---
Brilliant!
---
That's not what I meant, I just hope they fix it before the release of classic. Whether they fix it on live or not, I don't care much.
---
It's not. The statues are pretty cool and I have NO idea what will get Blizzard's attention. 
---
 I'm seeing non-partnered streamers get their invites, I'm just an idiot, no idea how they are getting their attention, but I'm failing to. *shrugs*
---
But they aren't. There's that example of the tigers and harpies in Durotar, but they don't *consistently* hit harder. Those same mobs deal the correct amount of damage to Joana at other times, and also dealt the correct damage to TipsOut when he was fighting them, so whatever was happening there was an isolated incident likely related to Joana's character, rather than a consistent problem with mob damage.
---
The same goes for elites in dungeons. Someone made [a good comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq6mdt/difficulty_of_dungeons_on_the_classic_beta_vs/) for SFK and WC, and they're both correct in the beta. NOBODY has provided actual comparative evidence of any dungeon having incorrect damage values; it's all just "but I *thought* they were harder!" or "this isn't Nostalrius-like!".
---
Is there much lore in the quests in classic? I can’t remember. I’ll definitely pay attention if you think there was a lot of lore going on in the quests
---
Things like this happened before streamers all the time, you don't need a streamer to organize a battle.
---
I completely and wholeheartedly disagree with this.
---
I wonder what exactly you are gearing for in retail. Do you do pug raids or pug mythic+? To me progressing is not about having a number (ilvl) increase. Its about getting stronger so I can do more stuff. In retail I can alrdy do everything with no gear, so progress is non-existant.  
---
I too will be playing solo in Classic. I have no intention of ever raiding in a guild. I will take my time to 60 (1-3 months in real life) and maybe after a few months ill start a new character. Perhaps ill do some dungeons. That's my whole gameplan for classic, and I know it will give me 300-500 hours of fun. Thats enough for me.
---
Yes there was a questhelper add-on that was used on private servers. Basically functions similarly to questing in retail. 
---
Will almost certainly be ported over.
---
Why are you bandaging after I used psychic scream?  It does no damage.
---
1. Here it happens because someone wanted to stop someone else from getting something. With layer asmon could just change layer and get the job done. Moreover, people who pass through arati may not even notice that 100 people are fighting if they are in the wrong channel.
---
2. "probably" it may be active until phase 2 we don't know actually. Which means that the entire levelling progression would happen with layering which is terrible for the community and the levelling experience.
---
How to overreact, 101.
---
I think he said that he won't accept any gifts until he has his epic mount.
---
I've never really watched streamers before, but I noticed that. Do people like watching someone who is pretty bad at the game? I mean he was pretty terrible and basically did nothing the whole clip
---
Whilst I really do appreciate the effort to cheer me up. Its not the same. You know... the lack of a crowd of people to run into... :)
---
you really cant judge the melee range from a pvp video as you did, pvp attackrange is affected by both leeway and lag.
---
You need either a fully static target or a mob from original vanilla.
---
Yards *DansGame*
---
Warfronts must be the least interesting addition to retail WoW I think I've ever had the misfortune of setting a foot inside
---
I'm pretty sure their response would be that they're happy that so many people are interested in World of Warcraft. 
---
I doubt they'd make a distinction between Classic and BfA streaming numbers, because currently Twitch has both under one category, which allows Blizzard the illusion that BfA is popping off too.
---
7 days old account, did you created it just to troll?
---
cuz it's fun
---
You'd be one of those shitty mods that bans everyone.
---
alliance strategy was run back to the guards LOL
---
No problem for the vQueue user. Your LFG chat message will be logged so he can see it easily amongst the crap and send you a whisper/invite. Your unwillingness to use the addon has no impact on the addon user, assuming you are looking for groups in chat.
---

---
Did you not watch the videos in OP or read OP at all?
---
Spell batching was a thing in vanilla, yet pet responsiveness was instant then. It only first became a bug in live WoW in Legion beta, and it's been in the game since.
---
I don't know for sure, but I imagine that each -type- of pet will be different from other types. It just means that if you have a cat pet it will be the same as every other cat pet (minus appearances).
---
For the horde!
---
Attack speed is the only difference.
---
Brokentooth will be the fastest. Pets were pretty much normalized in Patch 1.9.
---
So no special damage types for Lupos etc.
---
Soda got R1 multiple times in Cata, he's no joke.
---
This subreddit has been ass raped by r/livestreamfails.
---
I started in vanilla with no game knowledge.  Ended up as a frost mage, by the time I got to 60 and a few guides later I ended up a member of the first guild to down Ragnaros in MC.  I doubt I'll be first this time around, there too many folks that just never even stopped paying classic but the point is this: the endgame is easy to get into, it just takes a lot of time.
---
I love Preach, he was a naxx cleared Vanilla player so v experienced. Although he was slightly conflicted on Classic and he clearly loved it way more than he thought he would.
---
Angry at another person's success. The classic community needs to stop being so petty.
---
Rename was only a TBC feature no?
---
There are way more than like 10 people in the beta. They aren't taking up "all the keys."
---
Did somebody say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
I pretty much did that for a couple of months but then I got bored of that too.  
---
See you in Classic mate!
---
More power to him, but I hope he doesn't. Gold and the economy in general is super important in WoW, and not having to farm as much or at all because people give you money robs you of an otherwise fun part of the game.
---
I really like farming gold in WoW. Whether thats doing dungeon runs, farming mobs for grays and leathers, or through crafting and gathering professions. Its a really satisfying.
---
PC master race( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Imagine using DBM in vanilla. That's gonna be a yikes from me.
---
Yeah, probably. That's why I don't want to become a mod. I wouldn't be able to take all the hate thrown at me just for upholding the rules...
---
Streamers have way too much fun screwing around and playing with other streamers. I don't think they give a shit about realm size. Most of the viewers will only find out their realm when their characters are already made. 
---
The result is just going to be legendary server queues. The server with Soda, Asmon, Tipsout, EVERYONE will be trying to log on. I don't think even Soda and them quite realize the insane queues they're going to cause.
---
This is depressingly accurate, I really love how they basically made a whole new game with the community voting though.
---
This seems to explain it.
---
Assume both the player and target have 1.5yd combat reach, which is mentioned to be the default value.
---
Melee attack range is MAX(5, 1.5+1.5+4/3) = 5.
---
Ranged attack minimum range is 1.5 + 1.5 + 8 = 11.
---
The drawings more or less match using these numbers.
---
To the guy reading this comment right now wondering if he's talking to you. He's definitely talking to you.
---
&gt; (which is about halfway to 60).
---
If you go by "total xp" amount, sure but if you go by mob kills/quest completions remaining, you're a lot further than that.
---
I have good memories of Guild Wars 1 in this respect. The level cap was 20. You could buy Prophecies, Factions or Nightfall separately and combine them in any order. A character could be created in Nightfall (3rd release) and progress in backwards order, if you wanted to do it that way. 
---
Your point is definitely my main beef with WoW, an MMO that I certainly really loved over the years. I get turned off immensely by having vast swathes of the world being largely irrelevant beyond trophy hunting.
---
furblog about it, swifty
---
**Guild Name and location**
---
&lt;Guide&gt; - EU PvP Server- Alliance
---
**Language**
---
English
---
**Guild Type**
---
Hardcore PvE Guild, with mandatory PvP Events
---
**The Philosophy**
---
We're a guild where the leadership have experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive. 
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, with the goal of realm first and fastest, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we mainly need to recruit people.
---
**What we expect of you**
---
We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. We expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay and are able to research stuff yourself, in order to improve your gameplay. However, we’re always here to help you improve. 
---
We also expect you to participate in events, held by the Guild during the time we wait for a release, on our very own Test Server. We expect that when you chose to apply for this guild, you will show dedication towards it, even prior to Classic release. 
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule** (GMT+1)
---
Wednesdays 18-23
---
Thursdays 18-23
---
Mondays 18-23
---
Obviously we don’t expect to need all of the raid days to clear the content in the early stages. Most likely only one or two might be used. But when we start needing more days, these are most likely the times.
---
During new content release we expect to raid when servers open up
---
You can find more information over on our Discord, or by PM’ing me or an officer from the guild. We hope we caught your interest and that you're up for the challenge!
---

"wheres Mankrik's wife?"
---
"Use the quest addon like everyone else."
---
Boom social aspect of questing destroyed. Gone forever and we are back to neck beards playing wow by themselves. 
---
You see there is a measure of laziness that makes the game better or worse. Making people "thottbot" I think would lead to more general chat questions, because people are lazy. Having addons to tell us where to go would ruin vanilla experiences. But hey thats my thoughts on the subject and I've been on the wrong the side of "cool kids wow" for a long time now.
---
He was at 10k+ all weekend. I could understand how he was getting views a year ago when there weren't many classic content creators, but who is watching now? He's not good in the live format and basically every other classic stream is better.
---
Now I will miss the windows.
---
Kek
---
&gt; They don't seem to just obsolete content this way. You actually have to go through the endgame of each expansion
---
And because of player complaints the Stormblood expansion introduced story-skipping and level-skipping items (kind of like Heirlooms and XP-pots.) 
---
&gt; there are incentives for high-level players to help low level ones (and to be challenged along the way thanks to level sync).
---
Unfortunately level sync isn't perfect. I've heard players complain that it feels like they scratched and clawed their way to level 70, only to be “nerfed” back to level 50 all over again. When WoW tried to introduce scaling with safeguards against facerolling content, players complained that leveling was taking too long and wasn't worth it, so they nerfed it again.
---
Now, FF XIV is fundamentally different because any character can be any “class,” but even that isn't a safeguard against inevitable bloat. FF XIV is still fundamentally going down the same exact path as WoW—it just hasn't stacked as many expansions on top of each other yet. Give it time.
---
top kek
---
Bs, I said surprisingly accurate. Learn to read you clown.
---
&gt; Guild Wars 2 kind of sort of didnt completely destroy doing old world activities. It did this at the expense of invalidating anything that wasnt the most efficient farming activity for God awful terrible rewards 99.9999999% of the time. 2 blues and a green anyone?
---
I can barely remember how GW2 did it.. but I do remember how Guild Wars 1 did it! Definitely my favorite MMO experience to this day, although it has dated pretty badly by now.
---
No idea who downvoted you... but I was a knight and did a ton of raid healing. You made me feel better at least.
---
You have to think in mythic raids as well, let’s not pretend retail content doesn’t require effort.
---
He had some really ill-informed views about immigration and the White Identity, and he tried to debate Destiny which went about as well as anyone who knows Destiny might expect.
---
He apologised and disappeared from the public eye for a while.  Honestly there was a long gap between videos because of it, but he's back now.  However on the internet you can never be forgiven for your mistakes so people are still rather upset at him.  However I tend to disregard those people because they're very often the same kind of people who celebrated when Totalbiscuit died because he had bad opinions once in the past.
---
Iirc there is no cap.
---
If they intend to stress-test more than has already been tested. Yes, they will have to send out more beta invites.
---
I would also think it would be beneficial to do an open beta weekend to completely soak the servers in requests, so this is something I think they'll also do.
---
Not me. He stood and fought all day. He might switch to over when classic releases but that's just so he can have varied content other than "500v500 in zone of the day."
---
Mine did as well.
---
Well yeah, the game is much more in depth in terms of spells and what needs to be tracked in retail. Classic has significantly less to track overall
---
Thanks for answering my question, you are indeed a retard :)
---
PW:S is better in the long run because it doesn’t use up Innee Fire charges when you get hit so you only need to cast 1 PWS and not 1 renew 1 inner fire every battle
---
The more likable streamers are probably all at lower viewer counts, so no one knows about them. It's difficult to get noticed on twitch alone.
---
Laughs in Oceanic.
---
For real though, just avoid asmons and sodas server, you'll be fine. They're the only 2 that are big enough to impact the server with their legion of fanboys following them.

Hi, /u/Hetz_
---
Developers forgot that if you just let the players have free reign, they'll make their own fun. The most epic pvp battles I experienced back in the day were when we'd be in between queues for BGs and would raid horde bg queues and just duke it out all over the world. Raids in crossroads, raids at the horde WSG BG queue, orgrimmar raid somewhere in there, raid their zeppelin, fly to stv and raid booty bay, raid stv.. just endless world pvp, lol. was legit madness and so fun. It really felt like, you know, a world of **warcraft.**
---
Did you also consider the experience of having 1000 people in the same zone trying to level up? What do you say to that? Do you think it's fine and dandy for 20 groups of 5 players waiting for one quest mob with 5 minute respawn? Not a vanilla experience and definitely not a classic experience to look forward to.
---
they will never admit they failed with the (de)evolution of the game, their trash tier game now
---
to support this post spent a while to find some decent quality vintage vods 
---
https://youtu.be/351R487qLCQ?t=94
---
this guy has a bunch of hunter videos of pretty dam good video quality
---
if you watch in slow mo at 3:33 there is a very clear stationary pet attack , there appears to be momentary delay (he hits attack several times)
---
i dont have access to the beta so yeah cant compare 
---
he has a lot of videos that prob work ok for reference
---
a few times it certainly appears the pet attacks instantly as expected
---
Please explain why, I am genuinely curious.
---
Have you considered that he's angry because he wants to play on a server w/ Tips but doesn't want the repercussion of it?
---
Yeah, you haven’t, you pretend like you do because you’re salty for not having the beta. You don’t remember a thing, private servers replicated the beta almost perfectly with the big things being drop rates from quest items and aggro ranges. 
---
The beta is literally built on a 1.12 reference client. You’re wrong :)
---
Somehow he had like 10k+ viewers all weekend. I don't understand it. While I thought a lot of his YouTube content was ok, he is really bad in the live stream format. Seriously, every other streamer I checked out over the weekend was better. The only one who was less charismatic was Joana, but he's genuinely talented at the game so it was still entertaining.
---
Soda got R1 multiple times in Cata, he ***is*** good (even though ferals were quite broken back then).
---
However, as said by a guy above, this is not specially impressive for a Druid, it happens fairly often if you PvP with the class.
---
If you want a really impressive Druid escape, look at this clip from FinalFlash :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcXhQ42t75s&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcXhQ42t75s&amp;)

Hey, they were fun the first time... Before we all realized that it was literally just a scripted encounter that you sat through for 30 mins.  Had so much potential, but nop.  This is what they came up with.

pointless larping

&gt; In a raid you 100% need to be Holy.

Given 16 debuff slots there *is* an argument for **one** shadow priest in a raid.

Was this the one when you jump on the barrel then the wall then just fall down by the torch near the trade district exit?
---
That's kind of Blizzard's thing. They always want to up the ante, one major reason WoW was such a success when it launched was the level of polish that only Blizzard brings. Blizzard have always had some of the most well engineered products in the industry.
---
It wasn't until I branched out and played other MMOs that I realized just how well polished WoW really was.

People will help you in classic. Dive in with both feet and don’t look back!
---
You can’t expect people to not bring up somebody being a racist when their content is promoted in a subreddit they frequent. The consequences to positively promoting figures like this can confirm some really negative ideas amongst people that they may have been on the fence about. He made up facts to support his racist viewpoint.
---
I’m stuck between Dwarf Hunter or Dwarf Paladin. Hunter was my first ever character during the 7 day free trial days, but Paladin ended up as my first main. 
---
Frankly I’m just excited to use their treasure finding racial ability again. Thanks for asking!

---
The only thing that really makes that battle unique is the fact everyone is capped at 30.
---
Otherwise, battles like that happened what seemed like once a week. It was just less dramatic because the level discrepancies made it to where a couple high levels could steamroll
---
There's no hard cap (not a reachable one at least, even hypothetically)
---
yeah maybe , that rings a vague bell , that one was way too open to exploit terrain so doubt we will ever see that
---
i think it also mattered where you were like inside an instance zone something different would happen
---
too long for me to remember and i played later expansions
---
I'm starting to feel there's issues with just hand waving twitter etc as private entities who can ban whom they want simply because people have recognised they can game the system and mass report people until they're suspended or banned.  For example, TERFs are notorious at doing this to people who call them out.
---
Although, perhaps my issue is more with the automation of banning, rather than the act of banning people.
---
I prefer long time queue and having a hard time in the first levels than this.
---
First, it forces people to group up, speak with each other and go to different zones to level up.
---
Second, this kind of scenario only happens in starter zone and more marginally in the 10-20 zones. Past level 20 players will be more split up and layering becomes useless.
---
An acceptable solution may be to activate layering for 1-20 zones and not for the rest, but as it stands at believes it is really bad for the game.
---
cmonBruh
---
It's a troll, it most likely doesn't work
---
Actually Onyxia runs Stormwind thou
---
several of the recent expansions play with time or alternate timelines dont they anyway like legion? anyway yeah they can even bc was sort of going through a portal to a whole new experience
---
I never really watched Warcraft streams that much but when I flicked through the sections Warcraft usually has 10k. If it ever had 30k I would click to see which streamer was playing basically. With the release of classic I genuinely havent stopped watching the classic streams. I'm not hating on bfa either, I play it but I just use my level 120 to do older content easier so I don't have an opinion there.
---
**&lt;Legacy&gt; | US PVE| Alliance | NA |**
---
Intro: Legacy is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from first timers to boss kills in Nax. We are semi hardcore with a twist in that we are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role.
---
**Who do we want?**
---
Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn’t always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
**What roles are in current demand?**
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for dps at the moment, especially warriors, rogues, mages
---
**Misc:**
---
Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT)
---
* Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even  
---
those with little interest in raiding).
---
* World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases.
---
* Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---
**How to join?**
---
https://discord.gg/YSwVxBK  
---
 , we are still in the process of setting up appropriate tabs. Feel free to ask any questions/contact us either in discord or through this post.
---
EDIT: High demand for dps right now
---
Yea, I did so I looked at some of his previous posts to make sure
---
&gt;We idolize tips? I mostly laugh at him and his annoying tendency to overhype the smallest detail, but I got genuinely angry at him reporting Verdan for doing too much damage after vouching for no change. Fucking snowflake.
---
He just hates the guy.
---
the 100 000+ people who watched the event cared
---
i cant wait to gank asmondgold
---
And you're telling me he's talking about politics, but no where in the guys comment was there any mention of them.
---
Can confirm tried it out on beta and it works well :) just had to rename the folder and it worked.
---
Add Shroud to the list. He said he's not gonna play full time, but he will still pull a massive audience to whatever server he picks.
---
Yeah he's of Iranian descent I believe which is what took people by surprise since he's obviously benefited from immigration.
---
I think he basically absorbed information from other youtubers and then drank some dumb-bitch juice and thought he was an expert on the subject, but his "debate" with Destiny and subsiquent backlash shocked him back to reality.
---
YES
---
The optimal roster was 8 warriors because of their hit chance for taunt on the T3 (5/8T3 bonus iirc ?).
---
One missed taunt would make the whole rotation fail and an almost guaranteed wipe. 4 horsemen, 4 warriors actively tanking, 4 warriors destacking in the middle.    
---
Maybe you used a hunter to taunt momentarily for the caster horsemen but I'm not sure it's 100%.
---
maybe this works [https://multistre.am](https://multistre.am/)
---
I was watching Joana's stream which made it fairly easy to spot many things: he had built a new speedleveling route based on private servers, and often had to readjust it because of private server bugs.
---
A couple of examples from last night are the patrol route of the quest NPC in Thunder Bluff that gives you the quest Ashenvale Hunt, and spawnpoint differences in Ashenvale requiring him to readjust where he tames a specific kind of pet (Ghostpaw Runner), because on private servers they have static spawns while in Classic they spawn in different locations and patrol in large circles on top of that.
---
&gt;The beta is literally built on a 1.12 reference client. You’re wrong :)
---
I don't see what this has to do with anything. If anything, it should just reinforce the fact that the beta is accurate and private servers are wrong.
---
Well I think they know that bad decisions were made but I think those decisions were made by the chairmen who make profit from and for the game, if it were up to the developers they might truly want to give what everybody is asking for.
---
People have been playing vanilla private servers for over a decade, you don't last *that* long just out of nostalgia.
---
Sure there is some nostalgia but the main fact is that vanilla was a damn good and fun game, made with player's enjoyment in mind.
---
For the first time, Play however you like. That’s where the most fun is. Don’t watch videos about what are better zones for leveling, better gear, fastest way to level etc. 
---
Frost mage excels well at aoe damage. You will be leveling a lot faster than as classes such as warrior. Guilds/pugs will be bringing you in for your aoe dmg and utility. For single target damage your okay but not as best as rogues.  Frost mages also are very good in pvp. It’s an friendly beginner class. But all you will need to learn is how to kite someone. That’s the only difficult part. 
---
Mechanics for all the bosses are very simple. There is nothing hard about classic. It’s just grinder. Classic is very causal friendly. You don’t have to worry about that much mid/maxing bullshit like in retail wow. 
---
I will be playing myself protection warrior with my friend who will go Druid healer. And it will make questing/leveling a lot easier.  So if you can find someone who is willing to play with you, trust me it will be a lot more fun and interesting . But if you cannot that’s fine too. You can always join Guilds and find people around your level range and can go all questing together! 
---
Also make sure to go with PVP server for more spice.
---
TIL the people who voted for Hitler were just doing their democratic duty to exterminate the Jews
---
You could invest literally infinite time, a paladin in vanilla will never do acceptable damage.
---
The secret is &gt;!Sacrifice a gnome!&lt;
---
Where does that come from ?  
---
Actually maybe there was no Portuguese server at launch but there were many French ones.  
---
And there was some drama, Millenium is a big french gaming team and in the end of Vanilla and during all TBC they were seing as elitist jerks basically and we would just stop doing anything we were doing to fight them as soon as we saw one member.
---
I have a question. Might seem obvious but I still want to ask. You are supposed to register your old characters name and guild right?
---
16 as a night elf hunter. Dinged 60 off a ghoul kill. 12 as a priest ironically for my second character. I spent a lot less time figuring stuff out by then.
---
Lmao. Do you even know what the word "compared" means? If you're comparing something you need to know the value of what you're comparing it with. It's always ironic when the one calling someone a retard is the actual retard. Thanks for the chuckle.
---
Custom channels are fickle. There is a limit to the amount of people that can join, it changes ownership once the "leader" logs out and will fade out once the last member logs out, requiring the need to create it again. How do you guarantee such a channel is up 24/7? Can you point me towards a scenario where a custom channel were established that wasn't something created by the server admin (as it happens in Private servers)?
---
Also, in all my time in vanilla I never saw someone use Call to Arms and I grouped up with one guy that used vQueue on PS. He saw me flagged for LFG and gave me a whisper. It wasn't anything automatic about it, it just made it easier to see my LFG message amongst the constant spam in chat of everything else irrelevant for us.
---
The initial comment didn't state anything explicit, but the following comment chain had plenty of political stuff in it. I read through all of them, and I suggest you do the same if you try to debate about this....but please don't. I really am not interested in arguing with you right now(perhaps we can take this to a private channel instead of flooding this classic WoW related subreddit with more off-topic nonsense)
---
Warfronts could have been legendary.
---
But in an expansion with a focus on faction war
---
In a feature called warfronts
---
Whilst invading enemy territory
---
Why oh fucking why is it PVE only? Jesus fucking Christ blizzard, how fucking stupid do you have to be to make this, of all features PVE only but give fucking island expeditions a PVP mode.
---
Idiots.
---
The dps meters here is how i remember vanilla but it is vastly different on how it looks on private servers atm. Will be interesting to see the differences, this would affect my classchoice too since the only reason to roll a rogue would be to try and whore for #1 on meters.
---
First time I'm happy I'm not living in the US. This streamer culture is very distant to me, never understood why people like to watch others play WoW for extreme periods of time.
---
Pretty much the entire WoW section went to war in Arathi: Bahjeera, Venruki, Ziqo, Anniefuchsia, SonyD (ugh), Tipsout, Esfand, nmplol, etc.
---
"I am right because I have 2k viewers who say I am wrong."
---
Basically quests are the only place where you can learn about the lore!
---
i.e in westfall you learn about the defias and their history through the various quests related to them. I definitely think reading quest text is a big plus to the rp element! Even if its not your thing, it can be nice learning who exactly Van Cleef is and why he hates the people of Stormwind for example
---
Anybody reading this guy’s comment, please go read and do some actual research about layering so you don’t come up with the same false conclusion
---
Do you know of a better weapon progression guide?
---
Alright, I will explain it to you: it's doubtful that Esfand did this purely to advertise his merch if any, he did it just for lolz
---
That makes no sense
---
Can't HoT stack rejuvs in Classic WoW. That would be a massive change if you could in Classic.
---
They don’t need to. The streamers view counts are speaking volumes.
---
No offense as I do agree with you but I don't think difficulty has anything to do with it.
---
I'm using on a private server pfui, which is a typical full ui replacement. Works stellar so far
---
[pfui](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/pfui/)
---
This event was the highlight of my day yesterday. Better than the GoT finale, though that's not hard unfortunately. It was a blast to watch asmongold try and pull together a big enough group. It was really cool being jump to other people's perspectives in real time by switching streams. Unlike anything I've ever seen in WoW.
---
I feel your pain JonTron!
---
+1 for Perplexity, one of the better duelers in recent years.
---
Unless you have 3 friends 2 of whom happen to have level 20+ warlocks, no there isn't.
---
Just skip the teldrassil rep, get a regular horse/mechanostrider at 40 then use morrowgrain (or cloth turn-ins if they're available) to get any missing rep to get your epic mount as a saber.
---
You want to get near 310 - everything above isn't really necessary.
---
With 310 you wont get the glancing penalty anymore, which is the main reason why you stack expetise
---
Explain it to me then. I've already read about it and I still think that this is bad for some reasons that I've quoted in my other posts.
---
Yes, you need to have an active subscription. They only send them out to people already subscribed, so no waiting to get an invite to subscribe.
---
You basically have to gamble to get in.
---
I'm like 99% sure they were ment to be pvp but they ran into problems (probably lasted too long).
---
This, also overpower and deep wounds both benefit from slower weapons.
---
It's like 4-5hp/s
---
damnit, I knew I was missing something =(
---
LFG is cancer and I did play vanilla and cant remember ever using one or hearing of one back then. If they were around they were uncommon
---
I stumbled onto this in the beta on accident. Seems consistent.

I don't disagree with you. However I don't know if there's a human solution to this. The sheer volume of reports Twitter must receive would probably take a small nation of people to monitor.  Not to mention all the different languages and dialect that would need to be covered. Ai or report based bans is probably the only feasible solution available currently short of allowing everything.
---
Awesome! Does it work for nameplates aswell?, if yes, how is the positioning of the castbars? I just entered some random position and hoped for the best so dunno if they overlap with anything
---
I dont think you understand what World PvP in classic was like lol
---
I'm rolling RP. I don't imagine any streamer of reasonable size is going RP.
---
Or just re-tell it, in a much more modern game / engine / design perspective.
---
I disagree.  I actually like how they look.
---
Not true. Coming from someone who has worked in the industry. It doesn't really happen that big boss executives come in and change things, or demand developers do stuff a certain way. Wow has become what it is because the producers and lead designers have decided that is what is best.
---
Sure, the cash shop with pets and mounts is probably something coming from the higher ups, but that is hardly what the problem with modern wow is.
---
Hol' up, you can go Dun Morogh to Menethil as well?
---
Can anyone link me to this skip, it's incredibly relevant to my interests.
---
Not a really strong comp we're going rogue/war and we both already got a lvl 60 on nostalrius but we're not following any route
---
Priest is the only "true" healer in classic, and therefor also the easiest to learn. Shaman has some great utility in totems and AoE heals, but these require a lot of planning/learning. Druid is not bad but has awful mana management, and you are more considered a support class with battle ress, innervate and some cat form dps.
---
Hunter's Mark's graphical effect is bugged. It keeps on spamming the crosshair animation on the target, when the crosshair animation is only supposed to be played once per application.
---
Ooh didnt even think about that. Ty
---
I quit before sub time could be bought,  how much gold does it typically cost?
---
I don't think Classic will be that volatile. You can't just transfer all your chars to a different realm or buy a boost. Those followers will think twice about chasing after their favorite streamer once they invested a month or more to even get to 60.
---
Also is the pvp honor system the same? Do we have the option to remove the title from our name if we want to? Will the pvp rewards still be subpar?
---
This guy is a twat
---
Is it based on server time ? I remember in vanilla if you only had time to play during the day you would never see what the world looked like at night and vice versa. I thought that was awesome.
---
this is correct afaik
---
Yea I had a blast watching it.....
---
Yeah, subreddits are almost always toxic though.
---
Luckily they don't represent the majority.
---
They certainly are and it definitely gets me more hyped for the classic release. I suppose I just wanted to see a response from blizzard so I know that they are happy and pleased with themself, they've done such a good job and as sad as it is, people are quick to hate on them and say shit when they do something bad but not everybody is likely to thank them and show appreciation when they do something good.
---
Watch alot of pvp movies. Thats how I decide what to play.
---
Great video, im the best
---
rofl
---
This. You won’t be brought to raids to Dps. You’re a healer and totem support.
---
And this, gents, is why Druids are flag runners.
---
The reward in arathi are elementals to farm , that is a tangible reward. World PvP in vanilla could happen randomly but not always in a vacuum
---
hahah that was pretty epic and the speech sonydigital gave was priceless :D im glad alliance had to bite dirt x)
---
But that just seems impossible. I like and dislike these 4 classes for so many reason in so many diferent aspects of the game. Just like you said they all play very different which is why they appeal to me in different awesome ways which I all enjoy.
---
As a lead game designer on the World of Warcraft team, Ion’s primary responsibilities include contributing to the overall vision of the game and overseeing the creation of the game’s dungeon and raid content.
---
Hazzikostas joined Blizzard Entertainment in the summer of 2008 as a game designer, and his responsibilities have included raid boss design and implementation, class design and balancing, and maintaining the World of Warcraft achievement system. Prior to arriving at Blizzard, he worked as an attorney at a law firm in Washington, DC.
---
-------------
---
So here's his bio. He's was put in charge of the game right around the time it started to go to shit. I would argue flying mounts were a bad decision before him, but you the game started to get way fucking worse after Wrath, arguably during it considering it introduced a lot of shit that started the slippery slope to the current state of WoW. He was also a fucking attorney that happened to raid, even if he understood how to beat raid bosses, why was he even put in charge of such a large game with 0 experience?
---
You can't "buy" wow anymore
---
Oh well then that's just brutal, some things never change though, people stay mad to stay mad.
---
Best guy to watch! I always thought Jo-na because he is a guy.
---
Really? I remember having at least 5 druids per raid during AQ and Naxx.
---
That and having twice the amount of people LUL

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Thats literally not true.  You need to bring the cables (at least 2, power and video out) peripherals, (keyboard and mouse), and my tower is some 30-40lbs.  A gaming laptop doesnt come close to that weight.
---
I get the argument that you're making, but a high-end laptop intended for gaming does exist.  It doesnt overheat.  And it is WAY easier to transport than a tower.
---
Someone needs to make a list of these servers when it comes out.
---
Riposte is insane for leveling, even ignoring the disarm on it, it deals really good damage and the parry points you have to take to get it are a good chunk of mitigation.
---
His streams about classic were the best. I hope he’s doing Ok. Would love to see him play classic.
---
So the people who gave the power to Hitler after hearing his racist rhetoric were completely in the right then? You have claimed it’s the Democratic right of people to vote the way they see fit.
---
I'd like to know about the stress test that happens in just a few days now
---
My katakana and hiragana are a bit rusty, but these name translations seem not to be very correct.
---
Yeah in a lot of the post character creation clips, it says stuff along the lines of there being little armies left and that we are the last hope kind of
---
We were basically farmers or some shit that took up arms to defend our country
---
I support this
---
+15 is good, +10 is enough. No need to go higher.
---
would love to hear how they would do this not-complicated restriction without restricting other addons?
---
Anyone tried getting above Undercity? That was awesome, you could get up on top of the giant beams on the ceiling. 
---
I logged onto my friends rogue, banked all his gear and his hearthstone, and ran all the way to UC and logged him out ontop of the beams. Fun times.
---
care about balance on your server? Don't. Pick. A. Streamer. Server.
---
That's a modern machine, not like OPs. You are also saying that BfA runs on it. Then Classic will run on it too, yeah. And because Classic is much more light weight, it'll run better.
---
(Also, are you in the beta? :)
---
Yeah you're right, I could have added more to my post but I couldn't think of much more. Besides I don't really know too much about the game since mists of pandaria, even though I've played occasionally for all expansions . 
---
The pet store and mount store doesn't really bother me too much, I don't play for other reasons that I think you mentioned above
---
Well, there were definitely bugs in vanilla that would be nice if they were fixed in classic.
---
Of course, even in retail, blink still doesn't work if you hit a pebble, so I won't get my hopes up.
---
I would come back to swgemu if the server for a wipe so everyone had to start fresh. As it is now there are too many dead towns taking up precious land/materials
---
that punishes the entire party tho :D
---
Most quests actually have very good lore and story =)
---
well you only needed 3-4 hunters at max and hunters are one of the more popular classes and thats the reason why it can be hard to find a guild as a hunter
---
BT attacks faster but does less dmg, so his dps is the same as other cats.
---
Its only advantage is in PvP, interrupting caster more often then regular cats.
---
&gt;f you think such a thing as code without a signature exists. 
---
damn, you're clueless as hell.
---
of course you can sig everything in the whole world, are they actually doing this? no because that would be incredible stupid because you could literally just rename any string in the addon and it would have a new sig, you high?

Some of us don't have to try and actively learn simple map layouts. We can just learn it passively doing the dungeons. And some of us can remember more than like 5 things, apparently.
---
Mid 40s I guess. If you don't play healer + aoe and farm the shizzle out of  dizzles.
---
&gt; I am very well aware how APIs work. 
---
Apparently not lol.
---
Not really. Point 9 is about the skill of veteran which will let top guilds clean MC in 1-2 weeks, but this won't affect 99,99% of players.  
---
Point 8 is about general knowledge about the game, via the mass of guides, videos, etc ... everything is known and well documented, and this is available for everyone.
---
Awesome to hear! Thanks for your perspective :)

well you only needed 3-4 hunters and since hunters are one of the more popular classes there will be alot of competition to get into a raiding guild as a hunter
---
It's fantastic for nostalgia, art, information, lore. Highly recommend.

most beta players aren't streamers.
---
Because people look forward to TBC and wotlk. Like many love classic but i think many love tbc aswell and since blizzard is open for a discussion about post classic stuff they are extremely interested in post classic stuff. Obviously there is a right time to talk about this in depth with blizzard but i guess people are just extremely excited
---
they happened all the time, everywhere...
---
The beta is a very small scale comparison vs a overpopulated server, which I just happen to love btw.  IMO streamers should all go PVP servers
---
This is why we should push and push Blizzard to set aside "streamer free" servers, where streaming on those servers is a bannable offense.  There are plenty of us who don't want to have to deal with the drama on a streamers server.
---
Im not trying to pick a fight or anything...
---
But have you seen WoW?  It is cartoony.  Its based on a game where a running gag was if you clicked on a sheep enough times the damned thing exploded.
---
You've seen MMO games like ESO with more 'realistic' graphics right?  You get that WoW graphics /are/ cartoony, do you not?
---
Im just so baffled by this 'cartoony' argument that Ive seen around...
---
Yup, got into the Beta on the weekend. :) So far so good. Only found a couple of UI bugs, everything else is seamless.  
---
No, I'm saying that BFA \*barely\* runs on my 2018 Mac Mini (it's like a slide-show, I just gave up trying to run it on the Mini), but Classic runs very smoothly on it - OP's 2010 Mac Pro has some reasonable Xeon's in it, and an a discrete GPU, whereas my wee Mac only has a mid-range i5 and internal graphics only.
---
You make a very good point. Using the bible as an example was a mistake :)
---
You can read all sorts of books laying around the quest areas normally that give you Real sense of rp. But if it’s forced on you. I think this was really under valued in vanilla and I can’t wait to re read all the books
---
&gt;  Rogue stealth is the only updated animation I know of and it's being reported.
---
But it's the same animation...
---
The good news is that you’ll have plenty of time to swim and run back.
---
Come to think of it, I think they introduced more localized servers? Either way, point was just that certain nationalities would dominate certain servers in the eu scene, it was a pain to be stuck on one :p
---
I don’t take seriously any article where the writer can’t spell (to vs. too). The comments sound like they are from people who don’t even play wow. Can’t wait to prove them wrong.
---
Well in regard to what you posted here, not sure what other things you have posted, you’re making a bold ass statement to start with. 
---
Everybody likes to make it seem layering will have some kind of switch where you can pick and choose when and what layer you’re in; which you can’t. Goodluck finding someone to invite you to their party; sure if you and a friend happen to be on different layers, if you group up one of you will phase to the others layer, but after that, even if you disband, you’re in the same layer. 
---
Is there potential to abuse the system? Yes. 
---
However, it would require a lot of time, planning, and pure luck to have anybody you’re working with to end up on different layers. 
---
So when you go around saying “big PvP open world battles won’t happen because of layering”, you’re just spewing lies and exaggerating the reality of the situation.
---
Thanks for the explanation. The pserver community seems to have a huge bias towards a certain part of the political spectrum, so the guy that originally mentioned it got crucified without any thought.
---
I agree that if a person admits their faults or is trying to become a better person, deserves a break. Especially when Rupert Murdoch has a propaganda machine in a few countries. Do you have a source of where he changed his viewpoint? A twitter post or something else that shows he changed his mind&gt;
---
No. Almost all priests in private servers run disc just to improve caster DPS on burst bosses with PI.
---
And then there usually is one guy that goes holy + shadow debuff in shadow tree. Still focus on healing, but just keeping the debuff up.
---
honestly!! how in the hell is anyone supporting this guy after all the ridiculous comments he made about 'white genocide'
---
My hope is that classic is extremely successful and that influences the design of the next expansion
---
They could decide to add more content down the line though. I wouldn't be so sure that classic will stay the same indefinitely.
---
If you've watched Swifty before, you would know that he has ADHD or something. He literally can't focus on two things. He can't even have a conversation with the guy he's talking to because he's not actively listening to what he is saying. 
---
Swifty is a nice guy but fuck it would frustrate to talk to him haha
---
Every single time I give it a try I have learned that infact, it is pure shit. Of course it could be partly because I play ret paladin but overall it's also bad. I played lots of bgs in vanilla. In tbc I loved arena and got gladiator. Did some bgs in wotlk but did less pvp. In cata I still had fun times blowing people up in bgs as pretty much bis geared ret paladin. After that it turned into shit. Nothing dies anymore and everyone has so many defensive cds and healing. Like it feels like pure dps specs heal more than old hybrids like ret and it's insane.
---
I'm not sure i really understand this but pretty sure being able to swing after casts was a bug from private servers. Vanilla should reset swing timer after using spells so this would not work there. 
---
The main problem with ele-shamans is mana and the fact that the early raid bosses that are short enough for a shaman to shine are strong against nature damage. 
---
Sure some people might not care, but you're gonna have a lot of salty people in your raid unless you're playing with friends. But you will never do competitive DPS in any setting and you'll have to farm Demonic Runes and Mana potions to even be able to play more than a 60 second fight even with clear casting.
---
It is 100% sure there will be TBC and WotlK servers.  
---
The question is not if but when.  
---
Now you can ask : Will there be post Naxx content that is not TBC?  
---
That is a valid question. But it is too soon to talk about that.
---
Pretty sure that's just a line drawn from the unitframes to the center of the screen. It won't work on anything else, because Blizzard has disabled the functionality required for that kind of stuff after the AVR addon made waves in WotLK.
---
Guns from the 16th centry are very ornate and sometimes toy-like-looking.
---
Ok, so now we get into the topic of pet abilities and talents.
---
Is bite and claw fixed damage? If it attacks faster, doesnt these spells also go faster? And faster attack speed equal more chances to proc that one frenzy talent.
---
It’s nerf or nothin
---
As said Classic runs on the modern WoW engine. Maybe the Xeon is good enough (although your i5 is faster) but his video card is just too old, WoW doesn't support it any more. And BfA is *much* more heavy on the GPU than Classic is. It came out in 2004 and all graphic assets (models, textures, animations, effects, shaders) were designed for then. It's no match even for your integrated video.
---
Have fun with the beta! :)
---
Yeah, no wrong-thinking allowed.
---
WoW Streamers, no. JonTron, yes. Apparently...
---
Is that from retail?
---
The mobs look like they aren't damage half the time, just standing there with their attack animation but you don't see any hits being absorbed.
---
But when they do hit it seems like they are doing quite a bit of damage
---
“Insane burst and control” wow, it’s almost like he just ran in and pressed two buttons, man vanilla mage skill sure it hard, woo wee. Frost nova, arcane explosion, this is insane work right here
---
What about enabling guild banks only for guilds with 40+ members (plus the cost of opening it etc etc) ?
---
And if the guild drops to under 30 members the officers have 1 week to redistribute the contents before access is blocked
---
I suspect that was the case in the original version as well, but you just didn't notice it as much with the reduced density.
---
You do have a fair point. I also agree that layering should be avoided as soon as possible.
---
But I also believe, that it is a better way than separate servers, which eventually would get merged after the tourists leave. Both merging and layering has the same effect off creating a fractured playerbase on the servers after the merge, but at the same time I don't see any technical possibility to account for playeer count fluctuation from a playability perspective.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/xwIFtSP this is from the demo, but the graphics don't seem to have radically changed since then.
---
NO CHANGES
---
Perhaps I'm wrong... We'll see! ;-)
---
Try the original WoW client. It is very lightweight.   
---
BFA demands more than Classic client which demands more than the vanilla client.   
---
What is the Intel graphics in the Mini.  You are running Classic on high graphics settings?
---
Ahhhh so what you were trying to say is that you think private servers and beta are very similar to each other? That's some nicely ambiguous wording especially given the context of this sub.
---
And misinformation is everything that hurts your feelings?
---
I would spend all the time in beta for sure, but for now all that times go to pservers so i can pick class for the release.
---
I was leaning towards troll shaman, but then I remembered how goofy they look without transmog. Maybe female orc shaman then.
---
I haven’t watched or followed the drama at all, but bothered to watch Tipsouts videos just to get my bearings. And boy he is especially unbearable.
---
Skipped through his video with Monkeynews (who I actually follow to some extent), and it’s basically MN talking about the warrior class and Tips making weird and outright wrong assumptions and claims all the way through. 
---
Keep in mind MN has played actively since forever. I saw a clip from Tips’ stream (I think) where he basically said he was the best warrior on a certain private pvp server. Seems pretty delusional considering he didn’t even know the standard pvp and pve warrior specs two months ago. 
---
That being said, not gonna hate someone for being liked by others, he can do whatever he wants as far as I care.
---
I use two monitors so I never alt-tab and I see the same thing you do. My axe is non-existent. Even when I'm just running it doesn't show on my back. When I melee attack he swings the quiver as well.
---
Let me give you an answer worthy of your completely original, never before seen post: it won't.
---
Witcher 3 is easily one of my top 5 story games. Really immersive and rewarding with gear crafting. Haven't played GoW 2018 due to not having a ps4, but some of my friends played it and really enjoyed it.
---
The thought police have logged on.
---
I think it's because devs said they may be open to it if Classic is successful but I agree it's way too early to even think about it.
---
I've been playing MMOs for over a decade and I had a lot of fun in all of them, but after all this time I'm longing for a world where I can play what I want at my own pace without having to fear new content making everything else obsolete or having to relearn to play all my characters every time they make relevant changes to classes.
---
I want to enjoy that for a very long time.
---
I won't oppose new content as long as it's on separate servers, let Classic be Classic.
---
they hit around 70 per hit, and around 140 with their dynamite
---
but it looks the hunter is safespotting them most of the time and taking no damage
---
I think as long as you have the base game and a sub you get Classic as well with the sub.
---
Who'd wanna use that anyway? Retail players?
---
Imo one very big downside to any of the expansions was that the world got smaller effectively. One thing that makes vanilla so enjoyable (for me at least), is that it plays in the vast continents of azeroth and kalimdor. I'll probably leave classic if it develops in a similar way again. New content in classic should be within or build on the existing continents.
---
A layer holds something like  3000 people, it can hold 80+ for a big WPvP battle I imagine.
---
They also updated skada to work in the classic beta.
---
I am not sure what you expect to happen and yet I am sure it wont happen.
---
It’s not, at all. Read the sentence again. 
---
“Private servers are surprisingly similar compared to the beta”
---
You need to up your reading comprehension
---
'thought police' doesnt apply to making race baiting comments, sorry
---
BFA isn't required, just the subscription.
---
Interesting. How does Hunter's Mark behave in BFA?
---
yep
---
Completely a gree. If they wanna create tbc and wotlk..sure, just make separate serves.
---
Probably removed LOL
---
Did he report it is the question.
---
No need to buy anything, with just a sub your brother will be able to play both Classic and retail up to Legion.
---
Having to purchase the base game (battle chest) is a thing of the past.
---
All that is required for classic is a subscription. Download the game, subscribe and he’s good to go.
---
Shroud is going to play WoW? Never saw that coming
---
This. No idea why people think you need retail in any way.
---
Hah, I was a Tauren Druid back in the day because I loved them. My biggest obstacle to rolling Alliance this time is just that I won't get to be Tauren anymore :(
---
&gt;Comparing a newly released/rebuilt framework to a 14/15 year old framework
---
Are you a fullborn dumbass or is this learned behaviour? No fuckin shit this wasn’t fixed on live, it’s probably A) part of a huge backlog of bugs much, much bigger than this and B) probably incredibly difficult to fix. This is the kinda stuff that was likely coded at the beginning of the game’s development, so it’s likely the code for it has morphed and mutated significantly over the 14 years of constant use.
---
But hey, “bug not fix dead game lol”.
---
If not from an addon, people will just make a discord server..
---
What do you htink, which is better: solo 1-30, or duo with a warrior or someone else? :) thx!
---
He's also really good at deadpan sarcasm so it's hard to know if he's joking if he makes an off-the-cuff comment, unless you're familiar with how he really thinks.
---
Never played vanilla at launch. Just started a private server to ride me over until I either get beta access or the game launches. I'm only level six but I get it now... I really do.
---
They said that the army is away fighting the horde and that it is our duty now to protect storm wind and the human race at home.
---
So yes I think it makes sense if we have a peasants view on politics and not are buddies with King and Queen
---
VuhDo ist getting a classic version? OMG yes. 
---
Very few other dedicated healers I talked to use it, but IMO it's the best raidframe for healing. Or at least it was when I switched to it (wotlk? cata?). And I never had reason to regret that decision.
---
Ok so, in your general tab of your spell book you'll have a pet book called pet training. 
---
You can buy certain spells that are resistances and armor from a vendor in major cities where the stable guy is. 
---
Most spells specific to pets can only be obtainable in the wild. So if you want rank 5 Bite and you have rank 4 Bite, you'll have to tame a pet that has rank 5 bite and attack 2 or 3 mobs with it and at the bottom itll say "rank 5 bite has been added to your spell book" you release pet and grab your original pet and teach rank 5 bite. Only 4 ability spells can be taught to a pet. My cat knows stealth, bite, claw, and dash. I couldnt teach it cower for this reason. 
---
Also you cant teach your pet all the spells because they cost training points which you get by leveling pet and pet happiness levels. You just gotta pick and choose which ones are more important to you. You can unlearn pet abilities at the vendor for spells I believe.
---
They have been destroying pvp since cata because of their incompetence. Now, they can claim that most players are pve-oriented, and they would be right. I believe that, at this point, warfronts being pve is adequate.
---
I am absolutely on board with that. They could place him in front of the caverns of time in Tanaris, working on some technical stuff.
---
And when you talk to him, he just says something like 
---
"Sorry man, I just started with a project. Maybe you better come back in 3 weeks."
---
How do they break discord servers/bots that will do it?
---
&gt;dungeons didn't get hard in vanilla until the 50+ dungeons.
---
Lies, they got hard already in BFD and Gnomeregan when nobody knew where the fuck to go
---
Maybe the classic team has more competent devs that manage to fix it and then get the fix into retail too...
---
2005 this was really normal without any streamers etc, big raids even low lvl characters.
---
BFA is heavy on the GPU because of the upgraded graphical assets as you said - the Classic assets are still the same as Vanilla, just polished slightly. The models are still the old ones, the art low res (god, some of the character faces do look downright gross, esp gnomes for some reason). I mean, the Classic client is only 3gb, compared to the 45gb of BFA :)  
---
I have no doubt that my modern i5 is faster, and better, but those xeons would cope with it even with a cheap GPU upgrade.
---
Yeah, Vanilla through WoTLK are like the glory days for a lot of people. If Classic is successful, TBC will definitely be coming. 
---
People are expecting/hoping Classic is successful, which is why people talk about TBC being a certain thing. Because the only way I see TBC Classic not  being a thing is if Blizzard thinks they can't make money from it.
---
There was a blue post clarify this recently. I don't have time to look, but a screenshot was posted in this sub. The post confirmed that resubbing would make you eligible for future classic beta waves. I think the chances of getting in are low though, but I imagine they'll increase with each wave as they need a larger and larger population.
---
to be honest i think the ones who suffer most are the streamer and their fans.  for the most part you can avoid them if you're not involved with them.
---
it might suck if you want to level in a zone where a streamer is but in wow there are always alternatives at least
---
but im still glad im EU where we dont have too many streamers
---
To be fair, there are quite a few in the community who will begin harassing those with beta invites if they don't report tons of bugs.
---
refreshing inner fire and using long heals is actually much more mana effecient than using PWS, i did all the testing on pservers
---
&gt; dern one is transparent, old one as not - in vanilla you could hide under water and noone would see you, with the modern water you see through it
---
I don't think that's true. In 1.12 you can easily see under water and not being able to see under water would have more negative consequences.
---
They're probably the most sought after healer on the horde side, race isn't super important since the racials isn't that great for healing.
---
lol ok gaming notebook then
---
your dumb fucking semantics don't matter
---
AKCHUALLY if you can't use it on your LAP then it's not a LaPtOp
---
fucking idiot
---
High powered gaming laptops exist, are convenient, don't overheat, are still WAY easier to lug around than a tower, no matter what you tell yourself buddy.
---
Thanks man! Hope to see in classic! If you wanna stay connected send me a DM and I'll give you my battle.net tag
---
Normal people pretty much do that. They might not care for someone or what they do but they won't build up personal animosity against them. Reading through this subreddit it feels like a bunch of people have real life beefs with big streamers they probably never even met or had any meaningful interaction with. They are definitely in the minority I think but because their posts are so vitriolic it stands out and makes them look like they're the majority. 
---
Most people who don't care about streamers are just hyped for classic release and enjoy the classic content streamers provide in the meanwhile.
---
&gt;If I have a pet, how does it get new skills, talents, etc?
---
As a Hunter, you have a skilled called "Pet Training", where all the abilities learned across all your pets are "stored", your pet has a certain amount of points (depending on his level) that can be used to learn skills from the ones previously mentioned.
---
&gt;Do I need to stable the current one first and run "naked" out and catch a new one?
---
Naked or not, that's your choice (lol) but yes your pet needs to be stabled.
---
Refer to petopia for more info:
---
[https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/)
---
The only one I will watch is Crendor who is just super chill about it all.
---
I would prefer it if we had TBC and WotLK in 40man /20man versions as opposed to 25man/10mans
---
And no increase to the level cap please. Noflamepls yes I know that brings other issues on itemisation management...it’s just what I would prefer.
---
100% subjective, your post was a complete waste of time.
---
What can I say? Keep buying shit from the store and hope it titanforges into a beta invite.
---
TBC is the one I'm praying for personally. That was my real start in wow. Even though I played in vanilla I only made it to 30. But I started again about 4 months before WOTLK launched, so I didn't get the chance to raid or anything, and I'd greatly enjoy the opportunity now that I'm 31 and not 14. TBC had the most interesting story for me as well.
---
Warfronts were supposed to be basicllt WC3 RTS campains, but you play as the heroes. Then they stripped it down.
---
To clarify on this: You ONLY need subscribtion since the base game (every expansion except BFA) is included with the subscription.
---
What do you mean when you say changes? This was how it was in 1.12, they haven't changed anything.
---
Blizz hire this man
---
It's "UHD630" and no, level 5-6. Had it running at 1440p, but now on a 2560x1080 ultrawide. It's actually annoying that the 1.12 client didn't have an FPS counter :)
---
&gt;Try the original WoW client. It is very lightweight.
---
I remember - I had an AMD Athlon 2200+ PC when it came out - and I know the Classic/BFA engine is more complex,  but the weight of BFA is the content, and the refined complexity of the graphical models and elements. Classic is still using the old graphic assets (god some of them are ugly) which aren't so demanding.
---
Ah right, I forgot they did that. Cheers.
---
Classic uses Vanilla assets. No polish. :) All the "polish" is in the engine.
---
And yes, the Xeons are good enough, he only needs to upgrade his video card as I answered him in another comment. :)
---
Again is what they said, not what I want. They can block the group invite and chat access from addons.
---
You can still use trade chat to find groups the old fashioned ways of course.
---
Because up until a few years ago, if you never bought the game before, you had to, it was called battle chest.
---
People not playing for a long time may not know it's not like that anymore and think there's a box to buy to play Classic (or retail).
---
A professor at my college is a very accomplished mechanical engineer and I generally trust what he says on that subject.
---
He's also hardcore anti-vaxx. It sucks, but he has no influence in the medical field whatsoever so him having shitty misinformed (maybe even outright dangerous) opinions means nothing to me. I don't go to him for that.
---
Same here. Jontron's clueless and easily influenced when it comes to politics. Who cares?
---
2012 called...
---
it wants its lame copy paste joke back.
---
He’s a wow vet.  Played since vanilla
---
love HOMM, most of the other ones dont compare to 3, 5 isnt too bad though.
---
Btw /u/WatchYourSixx0872 - I know your post isn’t about Tauren hitboxes but what are your thoughts on Tauren Hunters? They gotta be Strictly worse right?
---
I was gonna go Horde but most of my guildies are going Ally so Human Warrior.  THUNDERFURY HERE I COME!
---
Fair point. I guess they are both just different styles. Not sure how it is more strategic though
---
Working on it.
---
What does the pserver community have to do with all that?
---
Yes, you are
---
For PvE they're healers. That is their single viable spec for raiding.
---
PvP you can play all specs to varying degrees of success. Elemental/Resto tends to be the most popular and consistent option, offering lots of burst damage and healing potential. 
---
Enhancement PvP is like a slot machine; its pretty memey and not consistent at all. Sometimes you'll one-shot people with 0 effort, and that 1 time out of hundreds is enough for people to enjoy it.
---
For PvP its Orcs &gt; Tauren &gt; Trolls
---
For PvE its Trolls &gt; Everyone else. Trolls have Berserking which increases casting speed by 10%-30% based on how low your health is; so basically just a flat 10% increase cause you're probably near full health.
---
Orcs have Hardiness which is probably the best PvP racial in the game. Tauren's have Warstomp which is a nice little AoE stun that is very useful, and I wouldn't blame anyone for picking them if they prefer to play literal mountain of Beef.
---
Troll racials really offer very little in the way of PvP.
---
I played the entirety of retail vanilla from ~a month after EU release on a PvP server!
---
In fact, the single event that got me hooked on WoW was on my first character, a druid, encountering an alliance raid on the xroads. The PvP patch had just gone in but BGs hadn't. I remember sitting back spamming moonfire and getting resist, resist, resist whilst I phoned up a friend from school who played telling him to log on quick as it was so epic. Ahh the sweet memories
---
This post has been removed because there are seriously so, *so* many comments that are political (Rule #4) or purely unrelated to Classic WoW (Rule #1). Sorry, OP, not your fault, but this post turned into a dumpster fire. Warnings / bans coming out once we catch up with all of the people that threw out really, really dumb comments.

Very nice :)

---
Sleep 6hours...
---
"Acceptable" is subjective. A paladin adds some utility, and can pull the DPS needed to pass the checks. Ofc it'll still be a carry :)
---
Yeah totally. I just think much of it is misguided and vitriolic because it’s ... the internet, it’s what they’re used to. It might be their way of saying exactly that? I don’t know, maybe I give them to much credit
---
This is bait
---
Haha enjoy dude, you can DL the clients straight from BNET. I had the idea because that’s how I started, Warcraft III plus frozen throne and then I didn’t get into wow until wotlk. But I wanted to brush up on the story before wow classic, seemed fitting.
---
Yes. Joana talked about this exact point last night. Faster attacks = more opportunities to crit and proc frenzy.
---
I think it'll be hard because streamers themselves would prefer that people not know what server they're on before they get a headstart. If they do announce what server they're gonna play on, I think there's a good chance it'll be a fakeout and they'll really be playing on another server.
---
This was released around wows 10th anniversary. Worth a look.
---
Fucking weebs.
---
Except this crappy guys is an "influencer" that have some followers, and he can influence them to report the same "bugs" he's so sure that are in the game.
---
So now it's not only 1 report, but 2000 reports and so on.

Isn't there a video of like a hundred players going there on Asmongold's stream?

Zerator in France is a big streamer who will play classic wow
---
It's the smile+mustache combo
---
I started playing about 3 months before TBC. Didn't even realize there was an expansion coming out. Hit 60 and it was like a month later I was grinding all over again lol.
---
So I'm with you. I'm excited for Classic, very much so. But for me like 80% of my nostalgia is tied to TBC.
---
I assume you are talking both for PvE and PvP.
---
In raiding, you will be healing 99% certainly. It's easy to do, just keep the correct totems down and mostly spend your time casting chain heal.
---
In dungeons you are not as good as a Priest but it's not a problem, especially if you keep a seperate set with int and spirit while leveling.
---
Leveling time, the are quite slow, but it's not like a big deal.
---
Enhancement is only viable for leveling. Not viable in PvP (only vs Warlock is it good), not viable in Raiding. Orc is the best race for it.
---
Resto is great for both PvE and PvP. Race don't really matter, I suggest either Orc or Tauren.
---
Elemental is great in PvP. While the 25% stun resist of Orc might feel like the obvious choice, it's the wrong choice. Tauren War Stomp means you stun them long enough to cast a Chain Lightning. It's huge, and the best race for PvP Elemental by far.
---
Casting resets melee swing timer, can comfirm as I am playing a shaman right now. gotta time spells like shocks for after a swing or get locked out from swinging for up to 6 secondsish with a slow 2h.
---
I'm EU so this is not going to be a problem for me, but take my advice: assume everything Asmongold says is untrue. He's so wrong about so many things that you shouldn't be concerned at all with that moron.
---
If you had good rewards and it required PVP the masses would lose their shit. Most players hate PVP, at most of the vocal ones, and based on the numbers of those that raid vs those that do competitive PVP.
---
Soda, Tips and Guzu doing SM GY runs, with Guzu (rogue) tanking most of the time since he takes aggro, and all he ever needs are HOT's on him. In fact, Soda is playing some other freaking game in a separate window while running SM. I'm sorry, but no amount of "we were trash players in vanilla" justifies or explains that. We were not so trash that healers weren't able to cast a single heal every 20 seconds. We were not so trash that a rogue could get hit by 2-3 elites of his level or above him for 10-15 without needing heals.
---
Tbh why even discuss what theyve said. 
---
Sure Asmon is right that there will be a streamer on every server cuz thats just how the gaming scene is now but its obviously just his way of rationalizing his (and other big streamers) negative impact on a server that comes with being a big wow streamer.
---
Just avoid the servers they roll on.
---
Feral druids do decent damage with the proper gear. And they use 2H's.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
That's cool, only know him from CS:GO, and later PUBG
---
Enhancement Shaman uses 2h. 
---
May I ask why you're so focused on "high competitive dps" if you don't know which classes uses 2h? Min/maxing isn't everything, far from it actually imo.

---
Enh shamans use 2H weapons too
---
Tips is cancer. Not because of his personality, I think everyone is absolutely equal in deciding what kind of personality they want to watch. If 100000 people want to watch a wall dry, thats their choice and not my concern. The problem with Tips is that he is consciously spreading misinformation, he creates drama for the sake of attention; he is everything a community figure should not be. There is nothing petty about getting angry that a person like him is supposedly a community representative. Everyone that considers himself a part of this community should be at the very least displeased about that. I dont mind him having success. Let him be a fortnite streamer or whatever. I simply dont want him to have any influence within this community.
---
I think he meant if you're healing in raids you'll need to spec holy/disc. If you're healing a dungeon you can get by just healing with shadow spec. You'll need to drink water between ever pull, but it can be done without respeccing.
---
Similar to what you monkey?
---
Esfand is good
---
Where are these vanilla haters? I’ve seen so many posts on this sub about them but have never actually seen anyone hate on vanilla
---
This doesn't make sense, can you clarify:
---
&gt; Comparing a newly released/rebuilt framework to a 14/15 year old framework
---
Neither WoW Classic, nor Legion/BFA are 14 year old framework. What do you mean by 14 years? Original WoW? Classic WoW is BFA with Vanilla skin.
---
&gt; part of a huge backlog of bugs much, much bigger than this
---
So you're saying it won't be fixed in Classic either? If yes - why do you agree in such a hostile way? If no - what makes you believe smaller team on side project will somehow have nothing to fix and it will be on top of backlog?
---
&gt; probably incredibly difficult to fix. This is the kinda stuff that was likely coded at the beginning of the game’s development
---
&gt; probably incredibly difficult to fix. This is the kinda stuff that was likely coded at the beginning of the game’s development, so it’s likely the code for it has morphed and mutated significantly over the 14 years of constant use.
---
Yes, original implementation is not coming back, that's why it will stay with current - buggy - implementation, hence my comment. If my comment is not clear, I can dumb it down -  this bug will not be fixed, just like new class will not be added and saying "it's beta" will not change that. Retards go "itsa beeta" like that is some kind of argument that clearly set in stone things will change. But how is this statement related to bug fixing?
---
&gt; But hey, “bug not fix dead game lol”.
---
Can you post a screenshot where somehow someone mentions dead game because of this bug staying? ctrl + f on Chrome finds only your comment.
---
sir, this is reddit not blizznet
---
If micro transactions weren't profitable, they wouldn't be done.  They weren't using 'mtx' before because it wasn't common enough to be acceptable. Now it's here, it's here to stay
---
ENH SHAMANS BEST SHAMAN. 1HIT CRIT
---
Strafe
---
What philosophy are you talking about?
---
Fury Warrior isn't restricted to just 1h weapons. You can do 2h slam spec which is still in the fury tree.
---
A lot of people forgot just how good that kid is at PvP. Multiple rank 1s and very consistent mmr in arenas every time he consistantly plays wow. He'll be someone to be taken seriously in classic PvP whatever server he rolls on.
---
I played WotLK so I'm not really informed on Vanilla, but still I like the idea of min/maxing my main
---
I see many comments on this issue being in the live game but its worth mentioning pet responsiveness is way more important in classic because pets get no special defensive bonuses vs boss mechanics like you have in retail. Even a small delay in responsiveness means death to a pet in classic, whereas in retail you probably often can get away with it
---
Afair, taurens can ride only kodos, of all rasial mounts. So your best chance is to get an undead horse from baron of white wolf from av rep (phase 3)
---
What makes you think that? Is it something in the code?
---
Fair point regarding the subjective thing, but what utility does ret bring that holy doesn't?
---
Figuring out which class to play, getting a new graphic card and desperately waiting for the game of games.
---
The only viable 2H spec is 2H Fury if you're on the horde side, otherwise there are no viable classes for 2H weapons that actually use them for something other than stat sticks.
---
There is no cap, but there's also no way to get above 314. (Maladath is +4 swords, not +5). 
---
A mob's defense level is 5*LVL, bosses are level 63. For every point your defense level is lower than a mob, your chance to miss, or be dodged, parried, blocked increases by 0.04% and your chance to crit decreases by 0.04%. It also increases your chance of glancing blows and the damage reduction of these glancing blows (35% at 300, 15% at 305, 5% at 310, and 0% at 314). Glancing blows cannot crit.
---
+skill will improve all these with the exception of % chance to glancing blow. That will remain at minimum 40% no matter what your weapon skill is.
---
On newer private servers, we could see advanced AI than ever before on private scene. Im interested to see, how much better it ll be on classic
---
The thing is classic may very well give birth to a popular streamer on your server. Maybe not in the 1st 3 months but you never know. I will be on a pve oceana servers so fingers crossed my server will be full on normal adventurers.
---
That is not the sentence you used. What was written was "Actually private servers are surprisingly accurate compared to the beta" which is much more ambiguous since the sub is filled with arguments about whether private servers or beta are more accurate to WoW as it was in 2004-2006. I agree “Private servers are surprisingly similar compared to the beta” is not ambiguous at all, but it's not what you wrote.
---
Why don't you like staysafe?
---
You missed the hilarious moment that the Horde tried to ambush the Alliance inside of Refuge Point and were immediately slaughter by the high lvl NPC guards. 
---
Wasn't a great idea but made for some great content.
---
Why specifically in the Horde side?
---
haha that is the best!
---
No idea who downvoted you. If the original vanilla is any indication, once battlegrounds with rewards came out world PVP decreased by an insane amount. 
---
My guild would regularly hold Booty Bay as our own pirate hangout and murder anyone who entered that was red. Epic battles when people from the horde would hear and start coming by boat by the handful or even dozens. 
---
That all but stopped when BG rewards came out. 
---
The thinking was "I'll get the reward and then go back to wpvp, but the rewards took so much time that by the time you had them everyone else was busy still trying to get them, or rank up. 
---
I bet in Classic there will be epic PVP battles in the real world, but I also bet that once BG rewards come out wpvp once again dies by a huge chunk, and Bags become the focus. 
---
People deluding themselves into thinking "this time will be different" vastly underestimate the pull of powerful rewards.
---
They'll decrease the layer number as warranted or when we reach phase 2. In the end only one layer remains with it's usual cap. So no, servers will be capped like they were in Vanilla. And if after phase 1 there are still too many people, there will be queues (and likely free server transfers to less populated servers).
---
I'll say Feral Druid &amp; Arms Warrior with the proper gear tied in first, in second Enhancement Shaman considering the randomness of Windfury procs and at the very bottom of the list a Retribution Paladin which is only on the list because they can equip 2h weapons.
---
**&lt;FREE HUGS&gt;** [H] (PvP) [NA] 🇺🇸 *(Tue, Wed, Thur: 7 - 10 PM CST)* 
---
🔺 **INTRO** We are known as **FREE HUGS!** We are a semi-hardcore guild for those who want to spend their time raiding and obtaining those epic and legendary items. We are a newly formed guild that is looking for anyone who has a passion for Classic.
---
🔺 **RECRUITS** We are looking for people who have the interest and dedication for raiding in Classic. We are currently recruiting any class, regardless of age or experience.
---
🔺 **LOOT/ROLES** We use a DKP system mixed with a small priority system. *(Tanks and Healers get higher priority over other specs first.)* We also assign *Officer* roles to those who want to help grow and assist the guild. *Class Officers* are handed out to those who would like to help players in the class group. *(Ex: Warrior Officers help Warriors in spec trees, tips, PvP, etc.)*
---
🔺 **SCHEDULES** We will raid on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays 7 - 10 PM CST. We also allow members to form camps for open world PvP or BGs. We will begin raiding once we get our 40 man group ready to go. We don't expect players to speed level, just have fun with it!
---
🔺 **GOALS** We want to clear all raid content, even through Naxxramas, at our own pace. We aren’t as hardcore as some other guilds out there, so we won’t be making any world/server firsts. However, we will be making sure everyone achieves their PvE and PvP goals !
---
🔺 **EXTRA** If you are new to Classic, Welcome! And fear not, we have experienced *Vanilla Veterans* in the guild who can give plenty of advice. We are a welcoming group and are here to guide you on your glorious Classic adventure!
---
If you would like to join, please send me a message on discord @NeonInuGanetto#3614
---
ok thanks!
---
As a middle-aged man with a low attention span and rapidly fading memory:
---
Same dude.  Same.
---
And you guys are ok with this? There is a reason blizzard didn’t implement their own lfg tool for the classic. If you guys want all the new things in retail to be in classic, why play classic at all?
---
Orc facials
---
Nah I don’t think so. The streamer market is too saturated. And all the mid / big sized current WoW streamers are gonna hog all of the viewers. We won’t see some nobody andy rise up to 5-10k viewers during Classic.
---
THIS, holy hell it is disgusting
---
Try out BfA (it's free for the first 20 levels). If it runs, Classic will too (and much better than BfA). If not, Classic won't either.
---
Having to use external services is a bigger hurdle than you might think and will turn off the majority of players from doing that.
---
Windfury Totem.
---
Having a discord server where you can talk to people and get people together for a group is perfectly fine and acceptable.   
---
It's the same thing as talking in the lfg or trade channel except you can reach people that are offline.
---
Windfury.
---
Windfury totem.
---
They're not going to block addons from using chat and they cannot block just one addon from doing anything without blocking them all.
---
JUST with access to chat, an addon is able to communicate between installations across the entire realm and /invite players.
---
They have bigger hitboxes but also a bigger range. Would be interesting to know the difference.
---
WF.
---
Windfury
---
I totally agree. The opening of separate TBC servers in 2-3 years is the solution. Give us one server by xpac until WOTLK. Everyone would be happy with this.
---
But I think Blizz gonna release a new MMO into the 5 next years, balancing everything to do the perfect game with Classic datas.
---
Believe !
---
I mean using discord is different from an in-game lfg add-on. Unless I'm misunderstanding?
---
*womp womp*
---
Happened.  Go read up and figure out which bosses in MC are not resistant to fire.  Go read up about ignites and scortch.  Even the doggies on the way to the second boss, the packs -- flame strike can be used on them.
---
But then again, it also takes skill to learn which NPC's are immune, you must have been loads of fun going into BWL and learning... Oh wait, did DBM tell you what to do when?
---
Yes they can mate
---
'payback' what the hell are you talking about? So much people come to this sub with interest in Classic only to see how toxic some people are...if anything you are just putting off people from a game you love :/
---
Yeah probably. I don't see the appeal whatsoever but people like being anti social for whatever reason
---
No there isn’t. Some Horde Warriors play 2H Fury but I wouldn’t call it competitive.
---
**[NA][Alliance][PVE with a dash of PVP]**
---
**Semi-hardcore player, with a hardcore mentality, looking for a guild**
---
**Other/misc details:** 
---
* Warrior (DPS preferred)
---
* 30 years old, work a 9-5 job, can raid in the evenings
---
* Eastern (EST) specifically
---
* Primarily a PVE player however I do love PVP as well. I made it to rank 10 in the original rank 14 grind and hit 2400 in Legion.
---
* Was a hardcore raider from the very beginning days of Molten Core and cleared everything to Sapphiron in Naxx.
---
For now, I can really only commit to semi-hardcore playtime. I would absolutely love to go hardcore but sadly I am no longer in highschool and have other obligations. While playtime may have suffered a bit I have maintained my hardcore mindset over the years and it has never waned to this day. I still raid even now. Full heroic BoD and CoS cleared for current content (Mythic doesn't interest me much due to the current state of the game), and I have raided in other games such as Final Fantasy XIV.
---
I can be reached here on reddit or via discord @ Arte#4321
---
Thank you.
---
Is that possible on beta? Definitely was not possible back in the day (shift click auto loot)
---
to add on this - if you're playing horde and have wf in your group you can dish out som sick dps with this spec
---
MCP worked in Vanilla the same way it works on private servers.
---
AV had pve enemies and was awesome.
---
Pvp-rewards wasn't the problem, bg's were. The time when the honor system was released without bg's was the most fun pvp in vanilla imo.
---
At least the arrow was redesigned (mangled, original was better imho). I noticed the crosshair bug while watching a stream. I can't recall any MC trash mobs having a big ass crosshair animation looping on their bodies. And we definitely had a mark up always while clearing the trash, I can still clearly remember the phrase "Nuke the marked one!". I'll try find a hunter video from back in the day when I get home.
---
Pray that you hit the BoP though considering they'll have like 20 other magic effects on them.
---
That's still pretty cool tho.
---
It was like a real world battleground where people haven't had time to twink yet.
---
Yep, I'm totally okay with it.
---
I'm not in the #nochanges camp.
---
I liked Vanilla, but I'd prefer a 2019 version of Vanilla. Obviously addons cannot add things like Guild Banks or Mage Tables, but they can do a whole lot to improve quality of life in other ways.
---
I'm a HiGh fUNcTIoning aDULt and I D0n't need BLizarRd.
---
In pve they’re only viable as healers. In fact Rshamans are very wanted by guilds/raids. 
---
In pvp all 3 specs are viable. But Elly and Resto are better than Enhance.
---
Don't be like that, swifty is cool
---
There has been people from EU. And not only content creators.
---
I was on twitch last night and it’s hilarious just how many streamers who were talking shit about Classic are now playing the beta 24/7.
---
Is it really that bad? Maybe im just lucky i havent seen much of the hate.
---
I tried BFA for 1 month before realizing i was not having fun at all.
---
I dont hate ppl who continue to play retail but i do hate to see what blizzard has done to a beloved franchise. 
---
The biggest win would be seing Classic overtake retail in players.
---
All the time? Everywhere?  
---
Aamazin'
---
'Poor people in back', too real
---
Reading your tirade about why people with dubious IQ's get triggered by a red hat with a few words on it make me believe you are a the fucking idiot in this situation.
---
Deathwing is cannon bad guy if that changes anything and cataclysm is foreshadowed by NPC in Stormwind. Pandaria was actually cool, there is Pandaren in War3 if you didn't know. WoD was trash, whole time-travel bullshit is trash. Legion is actually the main antagonist in War3 with void and old ones just mentioned. Warcraft 3 was called Reign of Chaos if I am not mistaken, it's title screen literaly shown Infernals falling from the sky. Whole story is about saving Azeroth from Archimonde. It was really good story, TFT was all about Arthas and Frozen Throne? It's been a while. Waiting for remake to replay it once again.
---
Why tf would any1 need dbm...
---
And on ally side they had a ret pally (lol) and a mount collector.
---
We already knew who's gonna win even before the fight starts.
---
But wouldn't the mage have the [Forbearance](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=25771) debuff then?  
---
I can't remember if the forbearance debuff persists through death but if it doesn't, then it could mean that Esfand actually did bop himself but because of some weird spell batching he dies and the forbearance either wore off instantly or never actually applies.
---
The whole reason for the fight was Asmon trying to get his Whirlwind Axe quest done.
---
You also can't really "instantly" damage someone as fast as you can on Retail. Warlocks would have to start DoTs to get damage rolling or cast 2,5 second Shadowbolt, Mages can fireblast and thats it, and Melees have to be in range.
---
The enemies actually reacted fairly quickly. Also everyone has to be on the same page when it comes to targets.
---
No screenshots, someone else said its a direct BfA addon and he doesn't reply.
---
Im the exact same boat as you it seems, cant wait for Classic but also really enjoy BFA for what it has.
---
What’s the matter with you
---
Swifty is my hero and always will be!
---
They can't really break them without breaking other addons that use the addon "chat" functionality (ie. anything that lets you share data with other users of that addon in-game). But there's not much point in trying to disable them anyway, they don't really do anything the LFG chat doesn't.
---
Hi, /u/Sone3D
---
[Sonydigitals perspective is even better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjwMgqvriu0)
---
He trolls to drive engagement. That's basically his whole stream. It's why he doesn't sunder when tanking for instance.
---
I would assume game design that encourages interaction within the world and server-wide communities.
---
They're just saying that over and over so they can fool themselves into thinking its true. They dont' want the guilt of knowing they're gonna be responsible for ruining the Classic experience for people. 
---
Feels good to be on EU for a change.
---
Damn, Savix, Stormx, Snutz, Venruki, Cdew all the big boys are in there.   
---
I guess playing on streamer servers can have its benefits. That battle was pretty nuts.
---
&lt;**UNITY**\&gt; \[**OCEANIC**\] \[**Alliance**\] \[**PVP**\]

---
**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/TWnNpEs](https://discord.gg/TWnNpEs)
---
**Realm** : Oceanic (realm TBA once the list is available)
---
**Faction**:  Alliance
---
**Region**: AUS - Oceanic
---
**Time zone**: Australian Eastern Daylight Time
---
**Guild Type**: Semi-hardcore
---
**Loot Rules**: Loot council.
---
**Raiding Time(s)**:  Weekends and some week nights - Again not set in stone but more than likely 6pm-12pmish. At the moment there will be multiple raids due to numbers. We will not restrict classes until after launch
---
**Intention**\*\*: We prioritize raiding and dungeons, PVP is secondary but will still be promoted.
---
**What We Expect Of Members**: Standard Non-Harassment Rules.  Just try to be respectful of the guild, have fun but try not to bully.

\*You don't need to be a raider to join either, while some of us will be taking time off at launch from work, many of us promote a work life balance especially those with families (myself included). If you are interested in joining just pop in the channel and write to us or message me directly on Discord.
---
People dont seem to realise that 90% of the time he's talking utter bollocks intentionally - constantly flip-flopping from one side to the other on arguments and literally saying dumb stuff. Yea he can be arsey and get frustrated over dumb shit too, but a lot of it is his 'character'.
---
Like you really think he got so big by chance? He's been leaning into the angry-neckbeard WoW nerd sterotype for ages. During the WPVP chat kept spamming "-50dkp" and "MANY WELPS" etc because he was playing up the whole "angry screaming ventrillo raid leader" thing.
---
That's a pretty good meme tbh.
---
&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website, just message me for the discord link. We also have candy.
---
Low effort, but good execution.  I'll give you the nod.
---
If I know Bite rank 1 and I learn rank 4 from a pet, do I also  automatically learn rank 2 and 3?
---
But the mage doesn't have [Forbearance](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=25771) debuff though...
---
Because he's bad at the game, and classic is not doing him any favours shoving that in his face.
---
fuck brd but lower black rock spire is worse, especially the original to get all the parts for the ubrs key ...
---
PVE = Resto  
---
PVP = pick what you want
---
Out of sheer curiosity (I don't even have beta access), how do you recreate it?
---
This post really warmed my heart. The whole thing, especially the bags.
---
No point ? Pserv were guinea pigs for Classic for 10 years.
---
Nostalrius closing started the community riot to get Classic.
---
Pserv has this social aspect, and always had it. If you can compare Classic to something It's obviously Vanilla since It's a carbon copy, but closely followed by Pservs.
---
That's disappoonting ):
---
And when the loading screen ends you falling down and swim 25 minutes...
---
That's not really the same as this though.
---
Here the problem is that a select few individuals have thousands of fanatical followers who are so desperate for attention that they'll follow the streamer around in game in a huge cluster. They're basically a swarm of locusts. Good luck trying to level in any zone a streamer decides to be in.
---
thanks. i can no longer play as orc..
---
Yea that's the thing. The game is out, in a better state that I was enjoying in private servers ( still very salty that blizz C&amp;D Nost ). Blizzard is just spinning off this Beta as a commercial opportunity is just boring to see as a long time follower. In no way that a a beta of 2 months is remotely sufficient for a game WoW's size, if it were needed for technical reasons.
---
True, but he was referring specifically to this Arathi battle where there was absolutely no reward. Honor isn't even implemented yet.
---
Are you expecting anyone to find this funny or what's the point? xD
---
I played a lvl 60 shaman a lot in vanilla. But only for pvp. 
---
They wouldnt invite me in raids because I refused to be a healer. 
---
I started as a elemental/enh hybrid. Sounds good, doesnt work. I came to find out full enhancement is a lot more fun because every attack you use is instant, so it's a warrior playstyle essentially. While elemental feels clunky and you're waiting for your spells to cast. 
---
You're capable of beating every class except hunters and warlocks. You might win 1 out of 10, but theyll fear you and kite and its game over. Tremor totem is just not reliable enough and theyll kill it before it goes off. 
---
Enhancement is a 50/50 you'll either have a close match or you'll totally destroy your opponent in two hits. Only good early in the game, late game it kinda sucks because of high armor rating on players.
---
Elemental is great too. You are a burst machine and with good gear, you are an anti tank, tank. That's if you raid a lot and got a lot of spell power. Only downside= no mana no fun and you run out of mana faster than you do with enh. 
---
You're gonna stack crit rating on everything if you choose to play enh. And while I went orc, I started to regret it because taurens are so much bigger and carrying around the unstoppable force looks much better on a tauren imo. You go back to feeling like you're playing a DK as you're swinging that thing around.
---
Yeah, and get a regular 9-5 job right
---
I think everyone remembers it not constantly having the animation going on, just curious where it might come from.
---
Plz take a copper from a poor.

Ah, I think you're right. The best we'll have is an addon that puts the loot window right on the mouse.
---
Yeah, poor rich guy :(
---
Excited to see where new battles may be happening in the new Classic.
---
While SS/TM and STV is guaranteed, would love to see more PVP world battles in Tanaris, EPL / WPL, and Ashenvale / Cross Roads areas.
---
Ill watch nobbel67 or Madseasonshow or possibly Preach if they decide to do classic  streaming but that would be it for me. Never checked out crendor so Ill watch a few vids tonight.
---
Which is why the fact that it took me three tries to beat VC for the first time is kind of embarassing.
---
Why do we PvP?
---
To crush the alliance, see them driven to Refuge Point, and to hear the lamentations of their Asmon.
---
The classic devs actually addressed the 40v40. Apparently there is so much going on with individual character procs these days that it creates tons of lag. More things will be based on server tics in classic.
---
Sadly its not, you will be going out of mana fast and heal for a lot less.
---
You have 2 options:
---
Farm the gold for the respec cost (which can reach 50g per respec)
---
Or ask to be the 1 shadow priest allowed in raid. Even then though shadow priests struggled to perform in raids back then and was usually only brought in to boost warlock dmg.
---
Well, who else could he really date?
---
Can you climb on the gate of SW?   
---
It was not possible on the demo I think but I hope it will be in live.
---
First, a correction. You’re right, [it’ll be on the same 14 year old backend.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881587/dev-watercooler-world-of-warcraft-classic) That being said, it’ll only be using 1.12 data, which means less effective (actually noticeable) bugs. I’m saying it will be fixed, because Classic devs aren’t working on some endless stream of constantly live code which requires new content consistently for player number counts. They’re working on a set project, with unannounced rough dates for further content, on a project which isn’t yet live, and which contains less bugs in the first place. If this releases half as buggy as live I’ll be surprised, because my guess is that at this point in development they’ve got half the team set on phase 1 and the other half on bug-fixing 1.12 data on the WoW backend they know and love, with the full support of the main WoW team. 
---
Your last part is literally just trying to address a throw-away line, which makes you look...less than intelligent. Nice try though.
---
As of now, the new models and animations are not in Classic.
---
Devil's advocate: some people don't need to fill their social needs with an MMO. 
---
^^^I'm ^^^not ^^^one ^^^of ^^^those ^^^people
---
Somehow classic has him actually producing content again and I'm all for it lmao
---
Pretty much this.
---
 https://clips.twitch.tv/FitSpicyMageCoolStoryBro
---
No, they really can't.
---
Babelfish is an addon that allows communication between Horde and Alliance. Blizzard made this a violation of the ToS so that anyone using it could be reported and banned/suspended. It still works today.
---
If Blizzard could target specific addons, they wouldn't have needed this.
---
The API does not have any idea what addon is using what function. It's all client-side.
---
Rogue t3 set its top good looking too
---
I reckon it will overtake at the beginning! It can only be positive, if it does well maybe they can tweak aspects of Retail to be more like the best of Classic, but with the Retail optimisations
---
Honest question from someone who doesnt follow streamers.  What is their appeal... what exactly are they offering?  I enjoyed watching pvp compilation videos or maybe watching boss kill videos... but why would anyone want to watch someone else play a video game live?  Like, these dudes are wandering around elwynn killing boars and people wanna watch that?
---
It is bullshit, I agree.
---
That seems very unlikely. They don't need voice, cause they're never fighting anyone they'd need voice for. Nowadays they just refuse all fights against other premades and farm solo queues.
---
I guess you are the arbiter of what is and isn't funny...I suppose that's why you responded in the first place. xD
---
Funny, after I saw what my phone corrected it to, I decided I’ll play exclusively as orcs.
---
This guy fucks
---
But there are already two stress tests scheduled.
---
Ah I see what you mean: Like, we all have the same access to the same knowledge, but the veterans (having 'trained' their skills to play the game well) will still be far superior in PvP and PvE performance than the rest of (new) players. Then I agree, Thanks!
---
The dude has become a prideful child. Thinks he's all high and mighty now
---
I have a feeling (I can't know for a fact) but somewhere in BFA the new type of traits like "standing next to X with the same trinket equipped does X" or "receive X when standing in this ground effect" has put a lot more strain on packet size and polling rate - couples with servers that are probably optimised to to run at the absolute minimum of resources and then scale when needed and I think you have a recipe for a major lagfest whenever too many people get together.
---
It sucks, I'd rather simpler spells and effects and the community willing to be all in one place, but now it junk the ship has sailed, people don't want to get into community events because they know it lags to shit - even fixing the issue wouldn't help unless you somehow forced everyone together somehow to prove it wasn't an issue anymore.
---
Call to Arms was a popular addon. It wasn't uncommon at all.
---
&gt; one of the guys in my guild went to get a job so he could afford a sub 
---
Back in my days, you were losing your job to be able to play more WOW !
---
Kids these days ... ;-)
---
The closest we had was Al'akir because it had the EU pvpers that made videos like Grim and Zalgradis
---
Whilst they stripped it down they seemed to miss that they took all the fun out of it too.
---
I thought they changed this in bc or wotlk... Pretty sure you could rezz at all graveyards.
---
These grass textures and the amount of foliage were in classic. People had potatoes for pcs back then. Literally the only difference is the movement if the grass. Look up classic wow graphics commands and see the light. These are not new you guys just had pcs that could at most toast your poptarts.
---
Oh so we're back at this again. I'm sure it would've gone better if he had only recruited people with a r.io over 2k.
---
Thinking something was a different way is an honest mistake tbh, its a 14 year old game.
---
But its crazy to see some streamers just insta report a thing without even researching a bit if this is normal or not its just "NOP this HAS to be a BUG, SENT!"
---
Hit the cog and turn the quality down from 1080p.
---
I just asked what you were expecting - not implying anything else.
---
[Check out the perspective of Sonydigital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjwMgqvriu0)
---
it’ll wipe again, always does
---
Am I a joke to you?!
---
While he was doing the Iron Man challenge a while back, he would read every single mail he got (it was half of each episode if I recall) but would decline taking anything that mattered because it defeated the point. That was a specific challenge, to be fair, but I think Asmongold's pretty good about doing things the right way. If he did say he won't take any gifts before he gets his epic mount, then I'm willing to believe he'll hold himself to that goal.
---
Its pretty easy to explain why. Theres no pvp.
---
It's a constant feedback loop.  People on /r/classicwow go to /r/wow and see criticisms and get all defensive and have to retaliate.  People on /r/wow go to /r/classicwow and see criticisms like this post and get all defensive and have to retaliate.  
---
Don't forget to expand this to other subs, blizzard forums and other types of social media.
---
Well Kodos are reptiles so I guess their animation is based on reptiles and not rhinos. [Komodo dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O16-IrBIscI) looks kinda silly when they run irl.
---
I think a PVP version would not be outside the realms of viability - islands have PvP modes, but warfronts could be long term PvP raids with strategic PVE content to atleast encourage some PvE players over.
---
Wish other streamers would stop harassing asmon though because they all moan about stream snipers etc then stream snipe themselves
---
Might as well start a new character at that point.
---
Bruh there’s no way that man is able to support that fast food habit alongside any other habit
---
Warfronts are not the same thing at all sadly.  
---
Warmode on the other hand, when the servers dont freak out, are :) Some amazing fights so far. Cannot wait for hopefully an even smooth experience in Classic :D
---
2H weapons are mostly for pvp purposes. There is a hunter survival spec that lets you deal decent (for a hunter) damage, but it requires weaving shots and melee attacks and is in general very difficult to pull off and in many cases not worth the risk.
---
The most dps you’ll get out of a 2H is fury 2h spec for horde with WF totem, this spec barely beats out pre BiS blues, and that’s with a BRE (incidentally the best 2h fury weapon ingame presumably, before naxx). 
---
So yeah, 2H is basically for pvp, with the exception of caster weapons.
---
Pretty sure it was fixed early on. Either way someone else reported that one of the streamers tried it on the beta and it didn't work.
---
Enchanting materials.
---
Do you think we will be getting a quest addon? Like mob locations etc
---
They're probably right - how many servers do you think there's going to be? Is there going to be a separate non-Streamer category of servers (Streamer PvE, Streamer PvP, etc) - of course not. Off the top of my head, just from the Beta, you have Venruki, Tips, Esfand, Asmongold, Sodapoppin, Staysafe who all pull in decent viewing numbers. Are they all going to roll the same server? Chances are, no. Unless there is some kind of gatekeeper enforcing that certain servers are streamer-free, I don't see how you would prevent this - so yes, all servers are probably going to have streamers unless the game gets so popular that they literally start adding additional realms to cope with the population.
---
I think that for the time being, there will be relatively few servers and they will be using layering to cope with increased population numbers in Phase 1.
---
Were there other items besides enchanting materials ?
---
Zugzug!
---
You should see that charisma when he’s losing or “aren’t prepared” for anything. It’s like the slightest ramp up in difficulty completely throws him off.
---
This is true. They came to the decision to have PvP talents way too late, trying to balance so many classes and speccs meant everything sucked and they just stopped making content for PVP past season rewards.
---
It's sad to see that side of the community die, but maybe it's what blizzard wanted all along.
---
Shamans got Chain Heal which is a heal that will jump from your original target to 2 others, so pretty good party healing within your raid.
---
They also got Windfury Totem which buffs melee classes with a chance to attack an additional time.
---
Long have we cowered in darkness. Mocked, made fools, laughed at for merely implying that *"Perhaps blizzard, would you please make classic server"*. Now its out turn to Laugh had the retail babies.
---
As I said, you need to learn to read, Christ.
---
Then you'll do premades with your followers, who are most likelly not r14 material as well
---
So let me get this straight, you want to play vanilla, but not that vanilla? Why would you want one of the worst aspects of retail to be in classic? Please watch this https://youtu.be/-k5K4a-teWo pay attention to the part that starts at 3:46, if you have time watch the whole thing, its actually a good video
---
Dumb dude, stop harassing my other dude... In what way for a game as big as Vanilla as textures go and all the networking needed AND working on a different game engine from it was designed for. BETA IS NEEDED The problem isn't that I didn't got it, or some streamer did. Its why they got in. They got in solely to create hyperbole and get more people in. Which is not how a BETA should work, at all.
---
My Panda Cub will rule them all.
---
A lot of people think they know better than others because reasons, not just streamers.
---
Similar to the beta, you mouth breathing caveman :)
---
&gt; Unfortunately it does not teleport you to the dungeon entrance but it will try to put a warlock in every group that can summon you. 
---
This is so retarded.
---
I'm in no way stating this as a prejudiced thing, but does the dev team really have 21 Asian developers? Obviously the Silicon Valley scene in general can skew Asian, but I wasn't aware it was that homogenous in Blizzard HQ.
---
Bartender please 😤
---
#nochanges and all that but #notreallynochanges
---
I mean everything without gear is going to be shit any melee is going to get pounded into the ground by a slightly geared range with rogue you can at least pick your fights most of the time
---
I remember an ancient game, the one where I actually got my ID from, where the GoonSquad was on the other faction. Everyone was always so incredibly motivated to take those fuckers out. It was lovely.
---
 WHAT IS WOW CLASSIC? Azeroth As It Was 
---
1. Experience the game as it was before the release of any of its expansion sets, and journey back to its beginnings.
---
Take straight from the official website. This is what we're getting.
---
You don't remember the goonswarm server then. That's fine.
---
Well that makes sense. The comment was deleted before I had seen it.
---
We can always hate on them in-between their cool events.
---
They already said the r14 weapons will be in its 1.12 state.
---
Asmonbald is completely wrong about a lot of things.   You know when he does the transmog contests and starts naming off where all the pieces are from?   Wrong most of the time.
---
Honestly, ww axe is kind of the high warlord gear of classic. That axe is whack at 30 yo.
---
My reply wasn't aimed at the "specific addons" issue you're refering, but they can block any access to api calls they want, is their code and their service. 
---
So just picture they remove the chat API endpoint, will it affect many addons, I'm sure it will, they sait they were gonna look into the classic API and prevent features that are intentionally removed from the modern client, because it defeat the purpose of removing the in the first place, they didn't specify how, I assume they let it evolve and tackle issues as they come up.
---
Items that can't be sold to vendor have no deposit.
---
Well, if you are naked you don't need to get r14
---
Ofc they are going to announce it. To get that mob that carries them, bring them gifts and worships them. :P
---
Perhaps not ever server will be a streamers server but guarantee every server will have its streamer. If that makes sense
---
OK, damn thought I could save some time
---
Yeah, it's almost like his enthusiasm for Classic is rubbing off on people. I can see where some gatekeepers of high quality game play (elitists) might be confused by his success.
---
WHAT IS WOW CLASSIC? Azeroth As It Was
---
Taken straight from the official website. This is what we're getting.
---
I added an addon I found, cool website :D
---
Any item with zero vendor price will have zero deposit on the AH.
---
So what i take from this is that you havent even watched joanas videos.
---
The mobs do correct damage, Joana himself has confirmed this.
---
No, but since they cost the same focus and the effect is better, you wouldn't need ranks 2 or 3.
---
Even retail is plagued by ZeratorTV.
---
I enjoy Zerator but I'll stay the fuck away from his realm ^^
---
There will be 1-3 layers most likely then there will be a server que, you are worried about navigating 2 other layers. talk about the sky is falling, lmao
---
&gt; But don’t rush man enjoy it read the quest text
---
Oh sweet god no way in the world am I doing this.
---
Might I also suggest if you choose to play enh, carry around a set of spirit+intellect gear and having an add on that you can switch out with 1 click. Because regaining mana is horrible when all you got is crit, strength, and stamina gear. 
---
Also some fun things you can try, if you got a group of 3 shamans and you all pop elemental mastery and cast chain lightning, you can 1 shot any player regardless of gear. It hits for 1.4k damage on average on a crit.

I don’t think that’s a political statement. It’s the only thing feeding the headlines right now no matter where you look.
---
Well, I'm perfectly aware that my post will be downvoted to hell and won't start any meaningful discussion, but anyway, I'll post it.
---
I would also wish these add-ons were blocked. It's exactly the same convenience feature like every other one. If we don't allow for other QoL add-ons, then we shouldn't allow for these too. QuestHelper makes the game easier, faster and lets you ignore the quest descriptions entirely. People will level A LOT faster with it - and it does influence my own pace and experience too. Yet, this add-on is "allowed" while - for example - DBM (according to some) is "yikes" because it "ruins" the dungeon experience.  
---
It's funny how some people hate add-ons like DBM, yet most people are totally fine with QuestHelper-like add-ons and a big GPS arrow on top of the screen that turns questing into mindless running from point A to point B without even looking at the quest description. That always felt like total cheating to me. Making questing "easier" is OK, but making your life in a dungeon "easier" by showing danger notifications is not OK. Perfect logic, right?
---
Questing is an integral part of the game. People should read the description, find their way on the map and find the correct spot to complete the quest. Yep, it's time-consuming if you haven't played the game before. But that's how it was designed in the first place, and that's the part of Vanilla charm. Using map-markers/GPS add-on is ruining that experience the same way DBM is ruining the boss fights or LFG is ruining the group-finding aspect.  People are just hypocrites because they usually don't like questing, don't find it as important as end-game content (I do find questing and leveling experience even more important) and want to level as fast as possible and "be done with it".
---
This has nothing to do with what I said.
---
Whenever you see a dk with the diamond trinket and custody of the deep... Gg enjoy waiting for 50% dampening.
---
Ewww. People actually used that?
---
I really miss getting random mark of the wilds or blessings, man. Always did a lil' /wave, I dont remember when it last happened... probably Cata.
---
Was funny seeing him on allcraft, he genuinely could not sit still for 5 minutes.
---
You'll find that comp more powerful than you think if the warrior takes all the agro.
---
Great! That’s all I am asking for at the moment
---
&gt; I'm still trying to wrap my head around the idea that someone else in the multiplayer video game is "wasting" your oh-so precious time
---
You don't think corpse camping somebody for hours on end isn't "wasting their time"?
---
Ok.
---
So they mentioned that we will be able to create up to 3 characters 2 weeks before launch in order to reserve names on your desired realm (13 August).
---
By the time you get into to STV, there will be no more layering. And if theres 2 TOTAL layers of STV, guess if either of those is "safe" ?
---
He's right. Specially because classic won't have that much servers to begin with.
---
Every server had an mirc that they would use anyway.
---
&gt;As always, I also expect overpopulation on Mages actually.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I was thinking with enh. shammy but a lot of dependency on RNG. Thanks for the reply dude!
---
&gt;You missed the hilarious moment that the Horde tried to ambush the Alliance inside of Refuge Point and were immediately slaughter by the high lvl NPC guards.  
---
&gt;Wasn't a great idea but made for some great content.
---
I only counted the full Raid vs Raid battles. There were some small skirmishes, but they were one sided since one side had a massive numbers advantage. They did kill a guard or two if I recall correctly.
---
Wow was made in Korea. Little known fact my dude
---
I don't consider LFG/LFR one of the worst improvements of retail. I loved it in WotLK and so did a majority of the population.
---
Using an addon that greatly improves the ability to find groups for content is not going to inherently reduce my social interaction with other players. By definition, it will increase my chances at social interaction.
---
As someone who has never had an interest in Twitch due to the ridiculous over the top personas, I can honestly say watching Perplexity has been a breath of fresh air.
---
The guy is what streaming should be about: he's extremely knowledgeable, interacts with his viewers, and isn't putting on some ridiculous act to create drama/entertainment. He's a genuine guy and it shows.
---
I've tuned into him every day of the beta so far, compared to the cumulative 2-3 hours I've ever spent watching any other streamer combined since Twitch started
---
Layering should help offset this - since there's less actual realms and multiple layers, when player counts drop off after launch the layers get merged so that each server should have a more consistent decent sized playerbase :)
---
Asmongold hardly reaches likme 20k sometimes on his normal streams, hes 40k+ daily on Classic. So is Sodapoppin
---
Will there be post Naxx content that is not TBC?
---
Huh? I think you misread my comment.
---
Even esfand looks like he didn't play vanilla with all the things he's gotten wrong and the false bug reports. These streamers need to get off their high horse and just play the game. Too much talk about how much they claim to know about vanilla.
---
I have used Call to Arms on private vanilla servers and what i found it most useful for was highlighting text in the LFG chat when I was looking for groups for certain dungeons.
---
Also it gave you a list of all messages wrote in LFG chat or all messages including the words you chose like "BFD" etc.
---
It doesn't fuction as a retail like LFG/LFR at all.
---
&gt; warfronts could be long term PvP raids with strategic PVE content to atleast encourage some PvE players over.
---
You've just described vanilla Alterac Valley.
---
Devs have said they have no plans to have a strict schedule for Phases except for getting to Phase 2 because of BG's and other necessary doodads. 
---
Beyond that will give people ample amounts of time to get through the content, and even delay Phase implementation if people in general seem stuck on some content.
---
Well he says hes considering going to a pve server, so that will confirm his soreness if he does end up doing that.
---
Rogues are pretty limited in organized bgs, and don't really contribute without CDs. Like without CDs, after your first fight, you're pretty much a gimped warrior.
---
Warriors are MUCH more useful in bgs. Warriors are also a bit better in pve, should have an easier time gearing than rogue, and should put out more dps endgame.
---
I certainly see your point, but as a peaceful dude who want to RP it up on a carebear server I'm all for BGs.
---
Those hitboxes lasted into BC, was fixed because they could hit through some pillars in arena.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgV6Gk7LfK4
---
Just do it like OSRS does it and have an intractable item in the cities, like a table or an npc, that will bring up the polls.
---
I suppose Blizzard could have argued “pservers are full because they’re free, and retail isn’t”. I’ve seen this theory before, that pservers thtivr because some people don’t want to pay for the game, or cannot afford it. 
---
The true test would be if official Classic WoW is a hit too, because Classic is $15 a month. 
---
I predict Classic would be huge, and beat pservers and retail easily. Whoever came up with LFG and sharding in Blizz years ago would have to eat their hat.
---
why would hey buy a house in america?
---
I personally can't stand playing rogue in battlegrounds. Very limited mobility outside of sprint, and even more so when in stealth. Once you get out of stealth you're very squishy with a relatively low health pool, so if someone decides you're a nuisance, you're ded pretty quickly. Even with high end raid gear I didn't like it very much. Obviously your mileage may vary and this is all just my own opinion and observations.
---
I would definitely go warrior for PvP, they're pretty fun at max level with good dungeon blues in both world PvP and battlegrounds, even more so with good gear. If there's a healer around, he will most likely pick you out to heal since a healed warrior is very durable and powerful.
---
I would gladly join a stream sniper gank guild if it was done in good faith as a way to keep things interesting and not as a way of bashing others.
---
Boss mods were expected in the beta.
---
Or how about you just let people discuss whatever they want to discuss instead of people coming out the woodwork, worrying about what people discuss on this subreddit.
---
Warfronts suck and are lame af
---
There’s no incentive to keep things short on YouTube since it’s all about keeping people on the site as long as possible.
---
Just the text in the readme feels like pure bait.
---
Thanks for the recommendation. Will be checking him out!
---
Removing the chat API endpoint won't just break "many" addons, it will break just about all of them. Blizzard is not going to do it.
---
Spaghetti code. Probably would require a lot of resources to fix and it's not worth it from a business perspective when they have expansions and patch content to make. Sucks.
---
D'oh. Well, the 1050 should handle it ok. I'm on a Dell laptop with the 1050ti and it runs both just fine. :)
---
[https://imgur.com/cBRwnyd](https://imgur.com/cBRwnyd)
---
Visual if needed. Emphasis on **AS IT WAS**
---
Hell, even if they made a new raid just for cool cosmetic things. Like, make the items in the new raid the same as some of the previous items but with a different model or color just to show "Hey, I did this content." Also, of course, mounts and pets.
---
I wonder if a streamer can reasonably tell their viewers to not just follow them around and shit
---
That's still organic, just the social dynamic has changed.
---
Good stuff mate! Saw you getting ganked by Soda in Ashenvale, you almost made it to the guards but your fear made him path the same direction, tough luck buddy!
---
Phase 1 = 2 months  
---
Phase 2 = 4 Months  
---
Phase 3 = 6 Months  
---
Phase 4 = 6 Months  
---
Phase 5 = 6 Months  
---
Phase 6 = 6 Months  
---
Reasoning: Phase 1 + 2 need to be separated but are for the most part the same phase. 6 months should be the standard for each content phase excluding them.
---
Laughs in trash buffs
---
I mean, 80k people are a lot more than no one
---
&gt;With Dual **Weird** you're at a 24%
---
Yeah I always thought it was weird to wield 2 weapons at once ! :D
---
Here's a guy that didn't play vanilla.
---
&gt;Gets unbelievably triggered by a red hat supporting the US president.
---
&gt;Durr u guiz r stoopid, haha.
---
Show me where the big bad Orange Man touched you.
---
Warden Staff, Wolfshead Helm, Smoking Heart of the Mountain, Mark of Tyranny, etc.
---
Wahhh! Everything about feral gearing is a huge gimmick!
---
I'm talking about actual vanilla here, not private servers. I don't understand why you're comparing it to a system that came long after it?
---
Warfronts are PvE instead PvP, which is why they were a blunder and met with a 'meh' reception.
---
Sure, but the number of those things happening were far lower than today. Today you have dozens of streamers with thousands of followers, whereas you only produced one example in the old days. It's far far worse today than it was back then, and if you can't see that, you're blind, and no one can help you understand what you can't possibly understand.
---
Did you see the 100 v 100 beta pvp in arathi?
---
Asmongold was trying to get a raid for whirlwind axe quest. Horde stopped him. I assume this means asmongold couldn't just go to another layer
---
Black Diamond, Pristine Black Diamond, all the librams/books from Dire Maul, dolls, coins and bijous from ZG, scarabs and idols from AQ, and I'm sure there's more.
---
AV was a mix of both. Actually just like wpvp encounters, when they‘re carried out close to cities
---
Tanking isn't hard in vanilla. People just don't like to do it for the same reason they've never liked to do it; additional responsibility + your fuck ups are noticed and will lead to raid wipes.
---
Its not that tanking is hard, its that you can have 1-2 DPS kind of phoning it in, you can't have a Tank doing that. 
---
If you liked tanking in TBC, you'll like tanking in WoW. Its not that much different imo
---
yes there are methods to do it.
---
the retail method of resetting works:
---
1 get in a group with your own twink ( ask your friend to invite your main and twink; friend can leave the grp now; you are now in your own group)
---
2 log back on your main
---
3 do what you want in the dungeon
---
4 log out of your main and log in with your twink
---
5 reset the instance with your twink
---
6 log back on your main
---
voila, you are standing outside of the dungeon with your main and the instance is reset
---
however there is a problem where the instance lockout doesnt apply with that method. so it is currently bugged and highly abusable. blizzard has to fix that before launch. (the lockout is bugged and not the reset method)
---
Sadly this kind of thinking is no more, now it's "yeah but with extra MTX we get more money".
---
There are people out there spending 1-10k €/$+ on MTX, one of these players equals to more than 1000 regular customers. 
---
I honestly do not believe that we will ever go back to the pre MTX games, these times are over. There are some left, but 99% of the big budget titles have some MTX implemented for the whales alone.
---
I vividly remember joining a 3x40man raid to all Horde capitals. The horde set up a possibly even bigger counter raid and then the servers died. No streamers back then.
---
He leaked bfa content and said its boring, hes been trolling Big streamers like Chance deleting an item he couldve used just for the LULs, hes been streamsniping in Asmon chat during the Arathi battle. WTF is wrong with this guy. Even Towelliee said he was a crazy fuck after they came back from the Irivine event.
---
big != good
---
No, but you dont need rank 2 or 3, unless the pet isnt high enough level to learn rank 4
---
It's not that bad, but we have low sustain both Classe are gear dependant and we don't have movement speed so it will take time to travel
---
Bruh, this is reddit. Being right of Stalin means you are a moron on here.
---
I see a lot of this assuming any naysayer hates the mere concept of Classic and wants it to fail but that really doesn't seem to be it.
---
I'm looking forward to Classic, I played Vanilla at its very tail end and it was definitely a fun experience. I look forward to going back and playing through it proper. I think it will be neat to play through a piece of gaming history that defined an entire genre, I think it will be fun to play through a cultural entity that so many people experienced and loves, and honestly Classic is just the kind of game I love; an adventure steeped in lore with some grinding.
---
But the key criticism people bring against the idea of Classic is one I think has merit; the idea that you can't recapture a feeling you have nostalgia for. There are a lot of people I talk to who assume they can fully recapture the social aspect and community that made Vanilla so magical. And I think we can definitely recreate that feeling a bit, at least at first, but the community is so different now. It's been 14 years, we aren't the same people we used to be, modern gamers aren't the same as they were back then, and whether it's to simply losing interest or dying we've lost players. Classic will have an atmosphere and community but as an entity it will become something new, and personally I'm very interested to see what it is, but I worry people who want a purely nostalgic experience might not mesh well with it. That said only time will tell, things will hopefully work out fine. The naysayers have no objective proof it will fail, you can't really prove a community will have a certain feeling. That said I think it's a bit early to say perfect success either.
---
That said the attitude of "fuck retail, they never believed in us, it's payback time" might be a bit off-putting to new players who might already be a little concerned given the weird "more hardcore than 1000 Dark Souls" rep Classic seems to have gotten for some reason. And whether you want those players around our not Classic needs to be financially viable if it's to survive
---
Layering is not in the beta yet.
---
I think asmon said something about not announcing his server until later so he can get his name first. Looks like it's going to be a surprise!
---
I think Asmongold might be an alright person in private but I just can't stand being fake. Whether it's for entertainment or not.
---
Same reason I stopped watching television. Why would I watch anyone when I know they're just faking everything. You can tell Asmon is faking a lot of his rages and failures and just says stupid things to get a reaction from his viewers who seem to think hes being real about it.
---
In defensive stance, spamming revenge lol
---
At one point in vanilla a great number of procs scaled with spell power, I was under the impression that all were nurfed to not do so anymore before 1.12, but it appears some survived until getting nurfed in tbc.  
---
The question would be if blizzard considers such scaling a bug that needs to be fixed or leaving it to be vanilla like.  All I would say is if the meta by aq patch is fury warriors in all cloth spell power, toep, a shard, and two hakkari manslayers that wouldn't be very vanilla like.
---
I had a troll called Bacun, sounded more trolly with the U lol
---
The was a quest helper add on in vanilla
---
Questie's fine and works on P. Did anyone try it ?
---
I've tanked high end content in retail vanilla+TBC as well as private server vanilla+TBC, and in my opinion, the time you need to put in is way higher in vanilla. The amount of gold you spend on consumables is way higher. I generally found TBC tanking life to be a lot easier and gold wasn't that big of an issue.
---
In PVP you're good at making Horde loose BGs when you discover that you can heal &amp; dispel your party.
---
Fortunately it happens rarely \^\^
---
+1 for VuhDo
---
Could i get a link to he's twitch please?
---
First 6-10 months is only open world pvp, I would for sure go rogue atleast to start.
---
Level a warrior alt ready for phase 3, AV release to easy mode rank and gear quickly.
---
\*laughs in Oceanic\*
---
I thought they can ride wolves too.
---
I can guarantee you that Venruki, Tips, Esfand, Soda and Staysafe will all be on the same server. They've said so multiple times on their streams, and they enjoy grouping up together for dungeons and shit, or do world PvP. Especially Soda. Asmongold will be there if he can stomach a PvP server, if not he will be the lone anomaly that picks a different server entirely.
---
These 180s are super interesting. I think a lot of people will end up being like Venruki here. Others who've gone through this are Jesse Cox, Toweliee (still less positive than some) and Preach (he was always going to play Classic, but it's evident he has been extremely surprised by how much he likes it).
---
I think a lot of non-streamers will go through the process as well, and that will make classic huge. Like, everyone will try it, its free after all, and a large number of those people will end up liking it.
---
If it's a "throwaway line" why did you even include it? It makes you look like the stupid one
---
You're right they won't, they don't publish subs at all anymore since WoD.
---
I'd like to know which servers the big streamers are going to be on in advance, so I can avoid them.
---
I hit that upvote button 3 times for that!
---
Todays world of warcraft neither feels like a WORLD nor does it feel like WARCRAFT
---
Summit1g might be playing, too. So that would be another big one.
---
Do you know if you are on the NA server or an EU one?
---
I am a software engineer and id say at a beta stage it has to be in.... its also the main thing they are testing with the upcoming stress test.
---
Dont spread false information
---
I fully agree with you man but if his channel blows up like tips to 6-10k viewers do you really think he will keep this chill mindset? or even be able to answer questions with the chat spam.
---
All the time these great channels get a flood of viewers(and most importantly money) and the streamer slowly starts to change.
---
I hope not because I'm really enjoying watching MonkeyNews and Perp.
---
Why would there be a queue? That's what the garbage layering is for.
---
Batching happens on live too, just with a higher frequency. You are generally sending more information on live due to procs from azerite, specs etc
---
I refreshed my Bnet a few times this weekend, even though it was the weekend and I'm not a current subscriber with any game time on my WoW account.
---
Not popular at all on my server.
---
&gt; I know there won't be any on my french server
---
&gt; Don't be so pessimistic
---
How about you stop talking about a situation that you yourself admitted to not have to deal with, and realize that people have experiences that differ from your own.
---
Amazing replies, thanks everyone. Seems like my Rogue plan is changing.
---
That's not going to be for a while. PvP Rewards and the whole Honor system won't be in at release, that's slated for Phase 2, and there won't be any BGs until Phase 3.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291079/classic-pvp-content-plan-explained
---
Same story, been really casually playing private tbc server that probably many heard of about in relation to certain aquatic city and I've spoken to more random strangers questing, leveling, dungeoning and grouping up for killing elites/ protection from involuntary pvp aka Banking than ive done since Cataclysm. 
---
My friendliest by lvl 47 is almost full of good peeps who tank, heal and dps on top of being decent, fun human beings, who make n-th Maraudon princess run fun and exciting.
---
The annoying parts of tanking are the people who need to tell you how to tank, the dps who don't ever wait for agro, repeating yourself over and over to a herd of cats, and everyone was an r14 that cleared naxx so of course they know better than you.
---
‘Cause? I’m not gonna sit here and justify poor judgement, but I will absolutely mention that responding to it isn’t in his best interests.
---
You wont compete using a 2h.
---
Maybe on trash packs with a monster 2h like BRE at the start or MoM end game as horde.
---
Active subscription, or at least some active game time on your account.
---
If you find a good guild that understands that tanks needs to be helped financially.
---
Slow combat is inherently more strategic since every action holds more weight. It's why strategy and action are generally antonyms when it comes to discussing types of gameplay.
---
I especially enjoy Wowcrendor’s streams. Most of the time he just re explores the whole world. Makes for a very chill stream. Also, aside from a few moments, I’ve really enjoyed watching Nixxiom. He has a habit of underleveling dungeons and not finishing them, which makes things interesting. He’s got a few moments where I’m like... dude... but it’s a good time overall. 
---
Also, Preach Gaming! It’s so fun watching him enjoy tanking, he’s got such a methodology that he loves to work. He said “I hate that I love Vanilla tanking”, or something close to that. As somebody that feels that sentiment, it’s been fun watching him. 
---
Also Venruki, Guzu, and Payo can be entertaining. And if I can help it, I’ll watch Esfand over Asmongold, but I can handle Asmond in small doses. It’s mostly the people around him and chat that is pure blight.
---
That sounds great!
---
I never phoned it in, even when playing DPS in Vanilla, so that wont be an issue :)
---
Do you often say things you don't expect others to read or respond to
---
Already saw posts about Blizz bear mount from Blizzcon and Murky because I should get my item too!! Wahh!
---
They fucked up.  It's a seperate game, you never needed to purchase vanilla to play Classic so making exceptions is a bad decision.  Countless salty people who lost their OG accounts, people trying to sell their accounts and boxes for thousands.  What about my TCG card Blizz?  Why stop there?
---
https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4282

From the creator:

&gt; ElvUI will be available for Classic WoW
---
Thank you for this post! It’s been happening so long I’d forgotten it wasn’t normal, and will also report this bug on beta.
---
The fact that this is over who gets whirlwind axe is insane. I hope blizz ends content for after naxx that has weapons like whirlwind axe
---
You can level with them.
---
Preach has been streaming! Did WC last night and RFC before. It’s a fun watch, though I wish he played with sound turned on.
---
# &lt;Informal&gt; (alliance) NA - PvE server - Progressive - MORNING ESTINTRO: Welcome to Informal, This is a brand new guild being made from the ground up. With some old school management I hope to turn this off hours guild into one of the very best on the server. Pushing content all while having a great time doing it.
---
**Guild EXPECTATIONS:** I value maturity and honesty above all else when it comes to my members. I expect everyone to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave.
---
**About me:** I have been playing warcraft since vanilla and have had years of experience both in raid leading and in managing guilds. 
---
I hope you all are willing to take this journey with me and produce one hell of a guild.  
---
**SCHEDULE:**
---
**RAID TIMES** \- EST, MORNING
---
7:00-10:00 AM EST
---
**RAID DAYS** \- MON / WED / THUR
---
Discord https://discord.gg/Dzb9rj5
---
From what I remember, you can't do any quests from another race's small starting hub (Northshire Abbey, for example), with some exceptions like Warlock Imp training (don't hold me on this though since I'm not too sure about that last part).
---
 Everything else is fine though.
---
I remember, on multiple occasions, in vanilla seeing an organized group of 100 or so of the opposite faction raiding a capital city to kill the king. I even went on a successful run to take out Thrall once. There was a massive battle in darkshire that a friend and I started by organizing a large group to counter attack a pair of level 60s ganking people. World PvP was a big thing in vanilla, at least on my server; which was even a PvE server. So I would agree with your statement. One thing classic will bring back I think is the organic community. The loss of that community is what's made me so disenfranchised with retail in it's current state.
---
I'm hoping Grid gets the same treatment, complete with the raid debuffs package.
---
I just need AlphaMap and I'm set honestly.
---
Just sleep man
---
Also there's recorded video evidence about all bugs they encounter. Super helpful to the devs.
---
so maybe plan on getting to lvl 4-5 then hit SW sounds like what I will need to do
---
Yeah, it's weird. If I had to guess, they probably changed the animation somehow to be a looping one somewhere down the road, and in Classic the new animation got replaced in the db with the old crosshair animation. Or something.  
---
But thanks for confirming it, glad to know my memory is still working as intended.
---
Don't feel bad, I was thinking the same thing lol.
---
Great PSA! Just picked up a couple!
---
Someone on launch will hit 60 in under 7 days of launch. Quote me on that.
---
&gt; Thank fuck I’m EU and don’t have to deal with this in any impactful extent. I honesty really feel for you guys
---
so much this!
---
Well this is also a unique scenario. There’s a level cap, and people still want to play. Makes spontaneous events like this more likely. But there will still be these fights on a smaller scale. I’m kind of worried layering might negate this a bit.
---
Exactly what I was afraid of... Job, house etc. all prevents me form going no-life like back in the day, so the thought of it requiring more time is a bit of roadblock.
---
They are not forced to stream.
---
**&lt;Awakening&gt;** NA, Alliance, PVP Realm
---
**About Us:** We are looking to have a very successful Guild in both PvE and PvP with dedicated leadership to make sure everyone is enjoying their stay and time spent. The guild will have a dedicated bank which eventually  will help fund the raids consumables and repairs. Team is composed of experienced players competitive and casual in both Vanilla and Retail WoW, FPS games, and others. 
---
**Schedule:**  Raids will be 3 nights a week 8 or 9pm until 11pm or12am (will discuss and go with the best time slots until). Off nights will be PvP, farming, and other guild activities. 
---
**Rules:** Have fun. We plan on clearing all content being the best we can be but having fun while doing it. I am sure things will get stressful here or there but ultimately let's have fun. 
---
**What We Expect:** Mature players who will do any learning before hand or ask for help before it is too late. Come prepared to raids with consumables and be ready for invites at least 15 minutes prior to start time. We expect players and teammates to help and give as much as they take and receive. 
---
**Contact:** Best for of contact will be sending me a private message here or sending me a friend request and message on Discord ***voltx#1384*** Please let me know on Discord you are messaging from this post.
---
&gt; So with your logic, hoping that dungeon finder doesn't come into Classic is also pseudo elitist gatekeeping? Calm down lad.
---
Yikes. From 3rd party addons that give you answers you'd otherwise tab out for to game changing features. Holy Strawman.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by "Classic is more BFA than BFA is BFA" because I don't play BfA, but I'll answer the things I do know about.
---
&gt;why is it when Blizzard tries to force world PVP in BFA for "extra loot" not a lot of PVP happens
---
Because when you add rewards to something, it is now a grind whether you want it to be or not. Suddenly you're optimizing you time spent to get rewards faster. People would do these events without any incentive, because the intrinsic fun of doing it was the reward.
---
There is rather vocal group around these parts that are very against PvP rewards in general.
---
&gt;I hate to say it but is this influenced by streamers or do people actually want to participate in the confusing chaos in Classic
---
Column A, bit of a Column B. People do want to participate in these events, and they did back in the dark ages when streaming wasn't a thing; YouTube was just a budding flower. However, when a streamer is involved, the community wants to be involved with them.
---
I assume you're referring to the Arathi battle? People definitely did that just because it was Asmon. Tips wasn't going to lead a 20 man skirmish that grew into a 120 man battlefield to stop some Rando Andy from questing; he did it because it was Asmon and it would be fun content for everyone involved, and it was for the most part.
---
But like I said, that stuff still happened before, but it was more of an organic thing as opposed to a coordinated attack on one person. A Rogue would gank you and camp your corpse. You'd call for guildies to come help you. He'd call his friends. And suddenly STV is a fucking bloodbath for hours.
---
Friend of main was a main tank. I made his food for him and he had an alt that made his pots. The guild made up the rest. Really took the burden off of him.
---
From the list of people I occasionally watch on stream, probably the only one being exceptionally good is MethodJosh.
---
This is not why people watch these streams.
---
People reviewing video games are also usually pretty bad at video games. At least not exceptional. They are journalists, not gamers.
---
In our guild in a raid group we have up to 6-8 shamans and 1-2 priests (with room for more) followed by 1-3 druids. Pretty much there is a shaman per group to drop totems but also for like AQ40 and esp. viscidous or ZG or Chromagus to drop clensing totems. Shaman in vanilla is a true support class. You can even do raid group screenshots with sentry totems!
---
yeah it just seems wierd to bring so many just for melee damage buffs and raid heals 
---
i guess if the raid heals are strong enough the other healers just need to worry about tanks 
---
does chain heal hit people outside your party?
---
Windfury and heals is all I need bby
---
https://youtu.be/yV2Qlio5_uk
---
This is hillarious guys, you got to see it
---
It probably won't.  I just wanted to know what blizzard had to say about the success of the beta launch testing.  Everything else I spoke about in the thread is not relevant. Sometimes I get carried away and shit when typing . I shouldn't do that
---
Layering is in the beta.
---
That is the point of a beta... to test the systems...
---
A LFG addon will affect the game way beyond the convenience of finding people to group up with.
---
Awesome, thank you! Went on the website but couldn’t find this thread :)
---
Like every single other gun in the game save for levels 10-30
---
They all look they came out of paperback mallninjashit catalog
---
It was quite amusing to see the PVP take place in the setting of a BFA warfront. The difference being is that people were greatly enjoying the WPVP more than AFKing in a warfront.
---
I guess people will always enjoy organic, spontaneous fun over being railroaded.
---
Windfury is a hell of a drug. Warriors are addicted.
---
But the LFG interface is not the problem with retail, the problem with retail in the dungeon/party gameplay is a sum of things:
---
\- LFG/LFR grouping people from different servers, so no need to know the persons you're grouping with as you won't see then again.
---
\- Dungeons reworked to be a zerg fest, sou you can semi-afk while doing it.
---
\- Quests givers moved to the dungeon entrance, so you don't need to travel the world anymore, you can just stay at main city and keep leveling with strangers.
---
\- Instant teleport to dungeon makes the world less alive, same as above.
---
All those things make the retail system the shit it is now. A LFG interface would just facilitate communication and free the LFG channel from spam, its way easier to organize this way and not bad at all to the classic feel as all other things that makes classic an social experience are still there in the end.
---
Nobody said that was the only way of doing, they said they were going to, we'll see how it goes, no point of discussing it at the moment.
---
It seems that you enjoy having the last word, so this will be my last message, so just go ahead and reply once more "they won't do it" and you win :)
---
BfA is a multiplayer / co op themepark semi RPG/Action game.  
---
What you do, you do it because you're forced to or because there is a reward.  
---
Classic is an semi sandbox/themepark MMORPG.  
---
What you do, you do it because you've set your own goals.  
---
If you want to do world PvP, you'll do it because you're out there in the world, you see an enemy player, and you decide to attack him. For loot? For Honor? No. You do it because you can do it, and because you've decided you wanted to do it.  
---
Everything in Classic is bound by what you want to do, and not by what the devs have said what you should do for the next three months waiting for the next patch.  
---
What is really hard to understand for retail players is that most things you do in Classic, you do them out of fun and adventure and exploration. Nobody told you that you had to go there or do that quest or kill that mob or do that dungeon. You've decided on your own by drifting somewhere in some zone that you should do those things.
---
towlie shouldn’t be let anywhere near this game. he has always been a vanilla wow doubter and retail advocate. but ooo something that’ll make me $$ better take advantage of my viewers and community
---
The second race down on the Alliance side looks like Cartman from Southpark.
---
kk thanks , yeah i really like healing but i dont think i would enjoy that job much
---
He has said that he would like to play on a PvP server but doesn't think that'd be possible in the long run because of streamsniping gankers.
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS. I hope I can copy my existing profile over ;D
---
Just dont think my mentality works with that, since I'd feel like I wasn't doing my part.
---
Which is why I'm a bit deterred from playing a prot warr in Classic. I never wanted to be the one slacking in a guild.
---
There are indeed people playing pservers just because they're free, there are even some people arguing in this very sub they don't want to pay 15$ a month, but they are a minority.
---
The are also people who never played on pservers because of their shadiness but are ready to jump on an official one, noone knows how many they are.
---
Those who can't afford it need just a little initial "investment" to level up on retail then they can easily farm gold to pay their sub that way.
---
I too believe Classic will be huge, there is quite a demand for MMOs going back to their roots, look at Everquest/old-school Runescape, also Pantheon being developed for old-school-gamers that are being neglected by every modern game.
---
I think by now Blizz devs realized that many decisions they made were really bad for the game, not only LFG and CRZ (more than sharding IMO) but also all the pruning of talents/abilities and a lot of RPG elements that made you feel you were accomplish something whatever you did, even from the smallest things.
---
I've been playing beta and I was more excited to learn arcane intellect and conjure water as a lowbie mage than when I killed G'huun. I really don't know what it is about Classic that is just so fun and satisfying to do the little things that got phased out or pushed to the side. Stuff like going to your class trainer, looting everything so you can sell it later, holding onto healing/mana pots because you actually need them.. Man. I missed this.
---
Isn't this also true for looting in retail? It has felt off for years now imo. Back in vanilla retail it felt way more snappy and fast.
---
I've tanked in Vanilla, mostly MC. It was a blast, learning how to tank certain bosses was fun too. Give it go!
---
there must be youtube video of the brill tavern somewhere ... it cant be hard to check right?

Check [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFVCL7NQwo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFVCL7NQwo&amp;t=1s) \- ele shamans aren't mages or warlocks but even on pservers they are more common than balance or rets, mostly due to ele/resto build that is quite universal at the expense of no mana tide.
---
Farming mobs and stuff is fun, nature vurnable ads in BWL are awesome if you won't pull threat off the tank (which ele shaman easily can) but in the end you will face some nature resistance on bosses and mana for longer fights. DPS won't be groundbreaking but it shouldn't be oomking also.
---
Large scale WPvP (and AV) for a mage is all about this. They can duel really well and they can stand back and deal damage, but the really big plays are finding an opportunitu to get in and do some serious harm to the whole enemy team. Don't think any other class is quite as good at doing this as a mage.
---
Based on the original release schedule:
---
Phase 2: Dire Maul / Azuregos / Kazzak = 15 weeks after launch
---
Phase 3: Blackwing Lair / Battlegrounds / Darkmoon Faire = 18 weeks after Phase 2.
---
Phase 4: Zul'Gurub / Green Dragons = 9 weeks after Phase 3.
---
Phase 5: Ahn'Qiraj / Tier .5 / Loot Revamp = 16 weeks after Phase 4.
---
Phase 6: Naxxramas / Scourge Invasion = 23 weeks after Phase 5.
---
But I seriously doubt Blizzard is going to make Classic players wait 8+ months for Battlegrounds and BWL.
---
My guess is 3 months between phases at maximum.
---
Fortunately we'll be able to create characters two weeks before launch. So if that's the only reason he could announce where heäs going to play before launch.
---
&gt; steamers 100% influence servers and the reddit crowd who hates streamers is not reflected in the beta player base at al
---
There is literally a Horde guild called "Streamslayers" but yeah when Classic goes live I doubt people will still bitch about streamers.
---
Alot of retails problems come from sharding. Nothing matters when there is no sense of community or realm. Every player is an empty face that has no meaning.
---
And on this day, all posts asking for the things mentioned above ***STOPPED.***
---
Agree! Once solo / duo BWL became possible my hunter buddy and I collected the Dragonstalker set and this gun.
---
We used to joke the only thing missing was if the gun shot whelps.
---
New names because the old names are still in use in Retail and it would cause confusion
---
new server names
---
I believe I heard a developer say they'll have new names for the servers.
---
 And don't worry, you can have characters in any server you want in the same account afaik.
---
Yeah I got a priest up to 20 or so on a p server before and I had way more fun wanding things to death than I thought I would.
---
So basically "Worked in a kindergarden" is relevant experience to being a tank in Vanilla :P
---
But that doesnt worry me much, its more about the time requirement and skill, but seems like consensus is that its not that hard skill-wise when compared to TBC and later expansions.
---
can just do what streamers in lol do, do your levelling/grinding off stream to avoid getting sniped
---
if you have an audience that big you can afford to take a few hours a day off and people will generally understand
---
Yeah but after this why ruin the opportunity to continue a good game on the right path?!?  Only if they make wow2 i will drop my desire  for new classic content.
---
Yeah, I'm just thankful that you can easily level without using guns and at 60 pretty much all BiS are crossbows or bows. Imagine if you had to live with these monstrosities and that damn sound effect at 60 without a choice.
---
&lt;Infinite Loop&gt; [Alliance][Unconventional][PVE]
---
Basically I’m going to be the GM for a guild I’m starting with a bunch of real life friends. Some played wow, some didn’t, but we’re all excited to enjoy this game together. 
---
That said, we’re looking for smart players, but not necessarily the hardest of core Min/Max’ers. If you roll some hybrid pally spec that brings a lot of utility to the raid and you’re good at what you do, you can roll with us. For example I’m rolling a Druid and I intend on being the main tank for all the 5-10 man content and offtanking/DPS’ing in the 20/40 man stuff. 
---
I’d also like to add a few more druids to the mix for some hilarious 5 man all Druid instance runs. (And to wreck some WSG) 
---
We’re mostly located in US central and we typically play after 8 pm and go as late as 11-12 most nights. Raid times are TBD but will probably be like tues-thurs or something like that. We all have families and need free time on the weekends. 
---
Loot rules will mostly be priority based, we could implement a DKP system if things get out of hand. But as long as we’re fair and equitable about it, I think we can likely sort that out pretty easily. 
---
We’ll probably never server first anything but I fully intend on getting further than I did the first time around, so a full AQ40 clear is pretty much required (at some point) 
---
So yeah. Come hang out, I can’t promise you the world, but I promise we’ll have a hilarious time doing whatever it is we do.
---
No one knows, my assumption is that it will be the servers we had in Vanilla; if not that the server names will definitely only be based on the lore of Vanilla.
---
&gt;will I be able to start a new character on an EU server without having to buy the game all over again?
---
You should be able to roll on any server, and  you don't need to buy anything. Any Battlenet account with a WoW sub can access Classic WoW when it launches.
---
What are warfronts? Havent played since Legion release
---
Are there any server names available yet? I don't have any friends living in the ME so I wanna choose a server where I can find people online to play with
---
Even more reason to say fuck these pathetic narcissists.  Just play the fucking game.
---
Yeah but I also have a problem with altohol.
---
We will though. Some countries have already started banning mtx, eg. Belgium. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.
---
No quests that I can remember that were race bound. Nelf can run to Elwynn and do everything a Human can
---
It's not spell batching that's fixed that (although it MIGHT play a small role). It's that the abilities themselves are much less complex. They don't constantly keep calculating a million procs etc. Blizz actually talked about going back and looking at how their abilities are built on retail because this (amon many other things) is ruining large scale PvP in modern wow.
---
It could be a new IP.
---
The original developer of EverQuest is currently working on a new classic-style MMORPG.
---
The original developer of Dark Age of Camelot is currently working on a new classic-style MMORPG.
---
I don't think it's any coincidence that Blizzard is exploring a classic version of their game right now.
---
Er no, I think that 20v20 (or what ever War Fronts are now) would crash the server, so they made it PvE :)
---
Don't I have to buy a new version of the game if I am closer to EU than NA now? The reason why I kinda stopped playing is that my friends from my NA server are on when I am asleep and visa versa.
---
This is mostly what I miss about retail these days. The game itself isnt boring imo, its just that you click a button, get in a dungeon, and get gear everyone else has. Back in vanilla -&gt; WoTLK (when I quit, came back a month ago) everyone on the server knew who you were and you could flex on dem hoes in Ironforge on your epic mount with your gear.
---
Hogger will be a server name.
---
Yes! The idea is that people will recognise you with your old name.
---
Let's have everyone who gets into beta report this. Because it is a change from vanilla WoW and it needs to be fixed. We don't need to settle for bugged changes from vanilla for no reason.
---
How many viewers usually?
---
IKR, I was watching him do AoE grinding and all the memories of learning that came flooding back. Definitely can't rule out a mage now.
---
It wasn't until I started following WoW Classic that I learned apparently "boomer" changed meanings and now refers to "anyone over 30".
---
And after seeing some of the joke images and the community of "boomers" proudly embracing them, I've decided I'm fine with it.
---
*sip*, I guess (I hate diet sodas, though, regular Monster for me! I exercise regularly so it's cool)
---
If I do this in retail, i'd just get nuked in 2 sec. + ThE LAAAaaaAAAaaaAAggg
---
While he kinda forgot he was playing classic....
---
remember back in the day when having lots of trash buffs/debuffs to rng cover the important ones was a real tactic
---
I didn’t start healing until Wotlk. Started with healbot and switched back and forth between that and Vudho for an expansion. Been with Vudho ever since MoP. Tried grid + clique a few different times but I just didn’t like it as much as Vudho. 
---
Definitely my favorite healing raidframe.
---
All microtransactions are bad.
---
\- Ohhh wow, you finally bought that mount? How many hours did you have to farm for it? 1000? Niiiiiice
---
\- Ohhh I want that mount. Here's 50 euros and I have it immediately.
---
See the problem?
---
i usto run whatever class i made to the human starting zone just because i knew it best 
---
played since vanilla only ever started from the human starting zone
---
If I were playing a healer I'd be drooling over VuhDo
---
Please can these tards stop asking for change
---
Outside a few specific instances, I don't believe race-restricted quests are really a thing at all. It's a pain in the ass to walk over but if you want to be a NElf and do the human starter zone, you're more than free to do that.
---
uhh is this a joke? you have to bind A to left strafe and D to right strafe. by default the game always had A and D as turn left and right respectively.
---
Illidan..
---
Hi there, Rogue player since the 3rd week of Vanilla. :). This is my own experience so YMMV!
---
Rogues in PVP were good to great in the right hands (same with most classes). Rogues, back then, excelled at ganking. Open world or BG, it was all about a sneak attack. Rogues were very CD reliant but could brutalize someone if they got the jump. You could essentially stun lock an opponent as a Mace Specialized Combat Rogue or, in many cases, 1 shot a cloth wearer using a Cold Blood CD with ambush. Sap is another friend of yours as you can stop a healer from catching up to a group which could be a turning point in a battle. Rogues, in Classic, were good for CC and sabotage ;).
---
Unlike today Rogues only had a single CD to help with speed - Sprint. No grappling hook or Shadow Step. Unless you talent into it, you're going to be hella slow in stealth. You're going to want to get a PVP build in order to compete in a BG. Ideally you'll be using a Subtlety build if you're going to do BG's. 5 points into Camouflage is a huge help as it makes you 15% faster in stealth and reduces your Stealth CD by 5 seconds. I would advise looking at  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue)  to get a good idea of what builds you can put together. Remember that it is expensive in classic to keep respeccing so do it on when you must. 
---
As others have stated, gear will always play a role. When you're in a BG the best thing you can do is antagonize the healers / squishes on the other side. Don't try to go toe to toe with anyone - you will not win. Let the Warriors handle the face to face combat. Sneak behind enemy lines, pick off the vulnerable, and move out. Being a rogue in a BG is all about picking your spots.   
---
Personally, I will be leveling a rogue again in Classic. It is what I had the most fun in for PVE and PVP for the last 15 years. I've dabbled with other classes but I always go back to my rogue at the end of the day.
---
Wasn't wintergrasp hundreds of people like this? I can't remember if they capped it or not but I remember fighting there for hours getting the raid unlocked
---
In rando pug BG's rogues are fine I suppose, in premades you bring like 1 or 2.
---
Warriors are great, yes like you said they kind of suck if they're not geared well. More important than that though, is having a healer to pocket you. Thats way more important when it comes to rolling people as a Warrior than gear imo. 
---
Obviously, everyone will do better having someone heal them, but thats honestly where Warriors turn into Juggernauts.
---
Vanilla had the best warfront (I know its technically a battle ground) before it was ruined, Alterac Valley.
---
I still remember when a buddy came over with his PC every weekend. We had chars that we only levelled together. In every zone we quested through, he'd start flame wars in the chat by posting terrible Chuck Norris jokes. He never personally attacked anyone, just occasionally post a terrible joke. That was all it took to have the chat go apeshit for a while. In Stranglethorn Valley it got so bad at times that they were getting level 60s from the other faction just gank him and shut him up. This of course led to pvp battles that lasted for hours, since other random low level players got ganked as well, which lead to them calling their guild mates and so on.
---
Your timeline would actually be close to or even longer than original vanilla timeline.  Considering there is a lot less mystery etc involved and no minor patches/balances, I would expect them to speed it up more to keep people from being bored.  I would think around 4 months at most between any content patches + shorter for a couple that don't provide much.  I would put the total timeline around 1-1.5 years.
---
&gt; they said they were going to
---
No they didn't. They said they "we may be restricting some of those new things as well" when talking about the API functionality in relation to addons that disrupt the vanilla social experience. [Source](https://youtu.be/wS1juqaiW3o).
---
Fair point. I guess I just missed the point of streaming entirely, people watch for entertainment purposes so naturally a more entertaining person to watch is more likely to get viewers over someone mechanically skilled. 
---
I figured the two came hand in hand but you're absolutely right
---
His initial CoC hit like 2 people
---
Were people mass-fighting in arathi on the beta?  Is there a link to this content?
---
They are banning loot boxes if I'm not mistaken and banning them is a good first step since they can artificially jack up prices for wanted items to absurd levels.
---
But regular "horse armor" MTX is probably here to stay.
---
&gt; Don't I have to buy a new version of the game if I am closer to EU than NA now? The reason why I kinda stopped playing is that my friends from my NA server are on when I am asleep and visa versa.
---
Also I need to create a new account and all...
---
bear in mind that people were almost categorically garbage in vanilla and a lot of the people regarded as the vanilla greats (i.e. people like swifty, vurtne, burn, etc) were pioneering in that they were doing stuff nobody else was doing, but their popularity made those techniques standard moving forward
---
were they more creative, outside-the-box thinkers than those that came after them? sure, probably
---
but are they objectively GOATs? no, probably not, and their skill level probably won't hold up against the TBC/wrath greats who came after them, before the game started getting simplified to the point it is today
---
I recently bought this one: 
---
 [https://www8.hp.com/us/en/gaming/omen/laptops/omen-15.html?jumpid=in\_r12135\_us/en/psg/gaming\_family/laptops/omen-15-laptop-learn-more](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/gaming/omen/laptops/omen-15.html?jumpid=in_r12135_us/en/psg/gaming_family/laptops/omen-15-laptop-learn-more) 
---
I had to have a laptop since I did not have the space for a desktop in my apartment. And this one is great so far. I'm happy I bought this one.
---
Actually, now that I think about it.. forget what I said. I play in brazillian servers and I have the option for american and oceanic servers as well, but not EU.. so I'm probably wrong about this, sorry :(
---
i certainly would not count blizzard out of possibly making a new mmo
---
retail subs are as low as ever , classic will boost subs but id be surprised if they are not working on several projects whatever they are
---
are they doing much with overwatch anymore? i thought that was their big thing but i never hear much about it anymore
---
A popular leveling tactic for orcs is actually to do the barrens - tb run instantly. 
---
There is also a crate spawn in the river along the way (you jump down through the shaman totem quest area). If you get it you can vendor the contents for some silver, you also get at least lvl 2, but probably more from discovery xp along the way. 
---
TLDR; totally doable
---
For sure - wasn’t trying to disparage you, just wanted to make sure you knew it was an unintended bug that made them slightly better on private servers.  I was torn between Druid and Paladin but friends want Horde so that makes my choice easy!
---
I really wish they would still take the time to make this a reality as I think it would be crazy fun. 
---
But unfortunately at this point they’re such a meme that Blizzard is probably just going to bury them forever.
---
This is a general rule of thumb, but you will usually get much higher resource gains with a desktop. Plus, the parts are more standardized which makes for easier upgrades in the future.
---
Since you are asking for advise, I would take the extra $200 and upgrade a desktop even further.
---
Warriors probably have higher scaling with spirit. Spirit apparently grants different rates of regen per point depending on your class.
---
Pretty sure that this is the reason why warrior regen right now is higher, but don't quote me on it.
---
I think that's the Chinese team working on Diablo Immortal, but I'm not sure at all.
---
Why? Is the question.
---
In which case you're still just looking at XP in absolute numbers. So XP wise yes those cut offs are right, time wise they are not cause you don't account for increased xp gain from quests, mobs etc..
---
Who we are: &lt;Birds of a Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.
---
What we are looking for: A person who is dedicated to the cause. We want people who show up to raids on a consistent basis (80%+). We understand things happen sometimes but just don’t make it a habit. We are looking for people who are more concerned with the progress of the group than the individual. We are serious about clearing content but can’t dedicated our lives to playing all day any more. We want people who are serious, on time, and want to clear content in a timely manner. This means when we raid at a certain time we are all in the raid at that time. Not all logging on at the time.
---
How we operate: We are ideally looking to raid two days a week. For three hours a night. Currently looking at Tuesday and Thursday 7/8-10/11 EST. For loot we run Loot Council. We prioritize giving loot to people who are actively trying to help the guild. This includes showing up to raids on time, attend raids regularly, help other guild members to get them raid ready, contribute items to the guild, listen to directions, etc.
---
What we are recruiting: Pretty much everything and anything at this point. You can check what we are looking for on our website linked below.
---
If you have any questions you can message me on discord @ frail_#3482
---
You can find our app at: https://boaf.enjin.com/
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
I really wish I dont have to pay again for the same game just because I am closer to EU now, and I wont buy a server switch especially that I may be moving back to the NA region at any time (maybe 1 year maybe 10)
---
Asmongold has tried and it doesn't usually work.
---
Lol, looks like chinese are the wow master race after all!  
---
It's just humor, don't hate me please.
---
&gt; Boom social aspect of questing destroyed.
---
"Social aspect" aka getting memed on. If I want an answer to a question I go Google it, asking General Chat would be the last thing I'd do. Why put myself at the mercy of strangers when I can get a reliable answer instead. 
---
The only thing a quest helper addon would do is remove the middleman of having to go to Wowhead or Thottbot or whatever.
---
I cant remember the last time i had so much fun watching a stream. I had Azmon and Venruki up at the same time and it was just amazing.
---
These raid size pvp events happen on vanilla private servers without any streamer or any other influence. Usually in Stranglethorn Vale. When some group is camping Hemingway for long time it will accumulate lot of people who are pissed off because they cant finish quests.
---
I've used it since 2008
---
Mhhh how ? Its about youtube videos afterall :D Not sure what you mean by "article" tho as ... youtubers usealy did Videos. And most people that doing youtube arent into writing articles.
---
Make sure you loggout in an inn, this makes you rested extra xp.
---
The server performance is looking good so far. Wonder how many people total were participating.
---
man squad streaming is dope, bless twitch
---
This guy (or gal) gets it. For YEARS we played games just for the fun of it. While I like RPG aspects of getting gear... it should not be the ONLY purpose of the game. In fact, I think it should be a small aspect of it. Much smaller than retail. Part of me even thinks Classic takes the whole  gear thing too far (the only reason it does is that it stretches out a game's longevity -- but it has been abused to the point of making it tedious and unfun).
---
No, he won't be able to answer questions, which will be a shame if it happens, but I don't think his chilled out attitude will attract 6-10k viewers like some of the "main" streamers.
---
As for whether he will keep his mindset if it happens, he's a Brit and being fairly subdued is in our nature :P
---
Just got the red aq40 scarab on pserver by rolling 100.
---
Hi, /u/zikron1
---
Come on Auctioneer! The only way I was able to make money was with this addon.
---
That's sad to hear but it makes sense. I've been having quite a bit of fun going through ARR and Heavensward while waiting for Classic, so I hoped they got that one right.
---
It's strange though: MSQ only has to be done once and alt jobs only have to be leveled up on FATEs/dungeons, and people _still_ don't like that? :/ Guess the instant gratification mentality that plagues retail WoW isn't unique to it...
---
It will not affect me or anyone that uses it in a negative way.
---
Oh god please.
---
Rolled a lot of classes in vanilla, refilled on servers before I settled with a class. 
---
What I saw when I checked back on the servers and friends I left behind was that almost everyone who stocked tona class were decked out in gear, regardless of how ‘hardcore’ they were. I especially remember a shaman who was basically the village idiot of the server, checked back a couple of months later, and there he was, in full T2.  
---
Stick to one character, it will pay off
---
Absolutely only priest issue I'm really having is when I can activate wand after casting a spell. There's a real brief window or two where I can activate it, otherwise it conflicts with some cooldown and have to pause, then activate it
---
If the server you're playing on Lights your interest in PVP but you Hope it won't be as toxic, I'd say you'll be fine to play on a PVP server in Classic. Vanilla was never, ever anywhere near as toxic as the pserver I play on. Hardcore griefers were rare to the point that the really committed ones in Vanilla became efamous. Camping Redridge when it's free to play and you're constantly fed a steady stream of low level targets is one thing, doing so on a 3k pop server you pay for is less likely to happen in my eyes.
---
my setup is all set but from now until august i'll try to decide between an UD warlock and an UD priest (holy)
---
They tried to make a new MMO and had to scrap it and hobble the pieces together to make Overwatch.
---
No way are they allowing something like this to exist in classic, Ion said so at blizzcon 2018.
---
EU has frostadamus though. That man is a legend.
---
and that's why I hated the addition of BG's back in the day, really killed the wpvp
---
Never fear:  elvUI is already confirmed coming to Classic, and elvUI is the UI that pfUI is based on, only it's even more feature rich.
---
I just don't think it would be fair to make you buy the game again.. you can always send a ticket asking about this, probably the best help you can get.. I hope it works out for you!
---
They are indeed lame however have you forayed into island expeditions ?
---
not sure if they were trolling but have seen people asking for pet battles, transmogs and things that are not QoL but out right features of retail xD
---
PvE could have worked, if it was possible to fail. If it felt like i was in a battle, a war, then it could still be enjoyable PvE (although having a PvP mode aswell does seem like an obvious and easy addition. Might suffer from losing tactical focus in favour of PvP deathball, but because its so easy that tactical focus is entirely absent anyway).
---
If you're trying to be at least mildly competitive in PvE, Warrior is the most time-intensive class in WoW. You're essentially playing two characters at the same time, maybe 2.5 if you're trying to PvP too. 
---
* A lot of Warrior BIS gear is expensive BoEs. 
---
* You'll focus on your Prot set but you also want a DPS set so you can be versatile.
---
* Tanking, DPS, and PvP are all completely separate specs so respec costs will be expensive.
---
* Consumables &amp; repairs like you mentioned.
---
If you're thinking "well, I don't have to be the best Warrior on the server, I'll just play casually" keep in mind that it's very likely that there will be more Prot Warriors on your server than the combined raid guilds can support. So, those raid spots can be very competitive and having some extra pieces of BoE BIS can come between you tanking bosses and sitting on the bench.
---
I would like to know the uptick just from people trying to get into the beta, that would be a bit telling imo.
---
&gt;Obviously, everyone will do better having someone heal them, but thats honestly where Warriors turn into Juggernauts.
---
thanks for the reply, at the end we should all play with what we enjoy :)

Hello! I am a hop-on-and-off WoW player who has consistently raided in semi-hardcore guilds. I have started playing at the end of Vanilla but only began raiding in WotLK and, since then, I have mostly enjoyed my stay and had great company, be it in raids or anywhere else.
---
Since most of my friends are now abandoning the game, the major reason for me to play is gone. My interest in the current iteration of the game is all but gone, and so I have now started playing in vanilla servers and I have been having a blast. For these reasons, I am now looking to start anew in Classic WoW, in a new guild, where I can make new friends, have fun, and achieve decent progress in end game content.
---
Feel free to PM me! I can provide my battle tag to chat further.
---
You can build a decent pc for 500$ that will play games significantly better than any laptop in that price range.
---
Loved pwning full t2 scrubs with my lvl 55 rogue back in the days
---
5m at peak. forsenE
---
Thanks, I will try and do that.
---
I don't remember the delay being so bad in Legion tbh, as I played my hunter throughout Legion and into BFA (for a very short time...) I did notice that delay in BFA though, and I absolutely couldn't take it. I made the switch immediately.
---
I'm actually glad this is something you're tackling. It needs to be fixed. I was considering Warlock in classic, and this is likely something I might not have noticed until getting my voidwalker.
---
classic was very combo and rotation focused, retail wow has become very focused on "press one or two buttons and wait for procs then do extra steps"
---
there's rng in classic but it's not particularly complicated or nuanced, just easy stuff like "10% chance to stun" etc
---
I was thinking the same thing actually, how about dungeons and PvE raids for dps warriors? any tips/info?
---
&gt; why play classic at all?
---
Because some of us like the way the game played back then but don't think that spamming a chat channel with the same message over and over is actually a stand-in for socializing.
---
would be interesting if they were to bring in completely new content, not TBC stuff but new stuff just for the classic server but i dont feel that would really be needed unless we were at the point everyone was clearing naxx every week
---
Honestly I would love if the Chuck Norris jokes would get a little update. I know it's nostalgic, but we have heard them all by now. Saurfang jokes or something like that would add some freshness to the jokes and allow for some clever Warcraft lore jokes.
---
Oh yeah... That would be sick... Took me ages to fully set mine up the way I like it.
---
Hey, do what ya gotta do to survive, right? 😂
---
in a lot of mmorpgs i had this problem. especially in daoc when there were like 30 classes. even in wow i had this problem of trying out new classes. now, though, after having played them all, i know what is out there so i'm going to pick the class i feel i want to play the most and then stick with it until 60 and beyond for a while until he's geared out and then maybe i'll think about alts
---
Doing gods work
---
"ADdoNs wONt HArM cLaSsiC"
---
If I were to bet, I would guess it's intentional. Although it is never easy to guess from the user side, the consistency of this "thing" gives me the feeling of either a lower-priority handling of pet related packets, or a big bottleneck, validating a lots of player information.
---
I’d be careful if you plan on playing Druid. I’m not sure if you’ll get your class quest still to learn bear form if you go straight away to elwynn
---
Ha, can't tell if you're joking, but from the surveying I've been doing it seems like 99% of the non streamer accounts that got beta in the first 3 days all had 2004/2005 accounts. Lots of people talking about their server firsts and histories. Blizz apparently did a great job of inviting people that actually know the content and are in the best position to report bugs.
---
&gt; anybody who doesn't like Classic still doesn't, in fact, like classic.
---
Good - I hope they don't play Classic if they don't like it. Instead of coming in here to ask for changes.
---
&gt; In short, you're just being annoying with no benefit or gain.
---
Gain Satisfaction.
---
&gt; The culture around this game is very questionable, and I pity anyone who wants to try and get into it for the massive entry barrier they have to cross by wading through these idiots.
---
Then don't play.
---
&gt;- Check [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) to see if by the grace of the gods you have been given a key
---
&gt;- Play private / retail / other game
---
&gt;- Get bored because it holds no draw because classic is coming out
---
&gt;- Check reddit classic board for more news
---
&gt;- Speak to your squad you plan to play classic with and organise whats going on for the 27th
---
&gt;- Check reddit classic board again for more news
---
&gt;- Watch streamers stream the beta well feeling a bit sad
---
&gt;- Decide to start the list over again by playing private / retail / other game.
---
&gt;Rinse repeat
---
FTFY
---
General discussion about the game is the only thing I can think of that is appealing. I watched a few of the beta streams and the WPvP was entertaining but beyond that it gets boring in about 5 minutes.
---
This guy was so shit though (sorry to put him on blast) haha. He played 16h/day and he had Lightforge and blue gear. Not even a judgement gear piece.
---
Because the addon is exactly the same.
---
Saw the same post for pet battles and transmogs.  It's just stupidity..
---
I hope to play on a server with a stream to grief the shit out of them. 
---
The fact people pay to watch some idiot play a game is infuriating.
---
Please god yes. Please Please Please.
---
I checked their FAQs, I will be forced to purchase a new game. Bummer..
---
I get that part I’m more or less talking about the click bait title.  I’m not saying it wasn’t a cool play I’m just saying the INSANE burst title into the 2 person cone of cold for 200 damage is a little silly
---
Paragraphs would really make your post more enjoyable to read.
---
Can't stand the heat. Get out of the kitchen.
---
if you upvote three times it’s like not upvoting is it not
---
It really depends on that phase.
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding your OP; you're interested in playing Classic? If a new battlenet account is required to play on EU servers, its free to make a new Battlenet account and you don't need to buy anything except a WoW subscription.
---
vQueue was already a thing on private servers, and it wasn't used much. You can't prevent people from using addons, and it's irrelevant if they do. What matters to the larger feel of the game is what is shipped with it.
---
I disagree. Let all the other things stay as they were but graphics needs a massive improvement. It's not 2004 anymore. We have actual reallife-like character models in other games, not walking cubes.
---
Would guess they plan to if not already patched stuff like this
---
The first 5 points changes your hit formula as it puts you within 10 points of the bosses defence level, so it gives you 3%~ hit as well
---
Not gonna happen.
---
Vanilla AV was the best. I wish classic was getting an earlier version of AV.
---
Well Vanilla raids were 40 man, so you had 8 groups. Rogues and warriors are best DPS so you can boost that even more with Windfury Totem. Windfury Totem only affects the party you're in, not the whole raid, so that is why you bring so many shamans.
---
My biggest pet peve with post vanilla is name change and server transfers. I felt it broke a lot of the server community. Cross realm pvp was fine, but cross realm dungeon ruined a lot. I remember character names being shouted in Trade/LFG chat for rolling need on items they didn't need and you could keep an eye on those names because they couldn't change it. Your server reputation stuck with your name and that is something I'm missing from todays wow. If they move over to TBC with transfers/changes, I'll be signing out.
---
There most definitely will be one.
---
This makes me sad. I even bought a 6 month sub to have a chance to get into the beta. Looks like i'll just ask them to freeze the sub until release, then...
---
It's 20% off mate, big deal imo
---
But I cannot change back to NA. My issue is that atm I am based in the ME and at any time (which I cant control) be relocated to NA. I dont want to spend time and money building up a character just to have to do it all over again when I relocate.
---
People talking about doing this shit. Speaking for myself if I was only running on 4 hours of sleep and got 60 I'd end up crashing at some point after. Probably end up waking up and getting back on only to find everyone I was ahead of is now caught up.
---
I think so. It's a great casual yet challenging MMORPG.
---
People haven't gotten to experience a good MMO in almost a decade.
---
The hate is mostly directed at people who want to change Classic to be more like Retail. Easy for miscommunication - but that is what it is primarily about.
---
[X] Doubt
---
They will let players create a characters in their selected realm a week or so before the game opens, so at the very least you will have a week to get together with your friends on a particular server. This is confirmed 100%
---
They will probably release realm names a bit before they allow people to create characters so that guilds can plan where they're gonna go but I haven't heard anything about this. Just an assumption.
---
This also exists for unholy DKs on live. I can spam that pet attack button for upwards of 4-6 seconds before I get a response sometimes :/ (also like 20-40 ping)
---
Yep! Play what you like :). Good luck in Classic and I pray you get Beta access so you can try all the classes out :)
---
Yes, Joanna did a whole video of that very issue.
---
A man can dream
---
Most of these personalities (refuse to call them content creators lol) will move on eventually -- as will their audience. It's the big shiny thing right now and many are just trying to capture views. Plus, a large reason they are getting such huge views right now is because it's beta and most people can't play it themselves. There might be 2 or 3 big streamers playing when its live... but most won't get much of an audience. There are much flashier games to watch. I don't think it will be a huge issue (except for the HUGE ones like asmon).
---
People are hungry for news and information regarding the state of the game. They are nostalgic to see low-level questing and things they can't experience now except on pservers. I never watched any of these guys until beta opened. And it took about 2 days and I already stopped.
---
As a warrior since vanilla I watched his videos as inspiration and will always like him
---
as said above its not that tanking is that hard its that dps cant seem to understand when they can fully open up as threat is a lot lower than it is now. once had a dps warrior ripping aggro every pull on onyxia and when asked what he was doing responded with "just heroic strike while i wait for threat" thought the raid leader was going to murder him as he explained that heroic strike was a high threat skill
---
so yeah as long as dps dont pop every thing the moment you pull tanking isnt that hard
---
On that map there was no not letting anyone on anything that map was very poorly designed and also back then hunters just shredded mages. And also beast cleaves entirely thing was during their cds they were unpeelable
---
It will be more than BFA pretty easily. Thats not even a question. These huge amounts of streamers will flood classic with their audience plus every lost BFA player heading to classic is a double loss for BFA. I know so many RL people returning to classic, it aint even funny anymore...
---
F for the Murloc
---
You can probably retrofit Questhelper with the Vanilla quest db. I'm actually pretty certain that it's what will happen.
---
Because the models (still not talking about character models) would have to be 1:1 polygon recreations otherwise there would be a discrepancy between, for example, where players are able to stand or line of sight.
---
Streamers - not quite(maybe there’s some influence) just go to hillsbrad or stv any given day and there’s a constant brawl. I remember years ago ending up creating raid forces just to squeeze alliance out of our questing areas in STV and there’s legends of epic battles from hillsbrad.
---
I really dont want to be on a server with a huge streamer but at the same time. Itd be fun to gank em.
---
and the magic is somewhere near that middle man my bro. Optimization is the enemy of classic. You don't want to use general chat because you are used to "real" wow. Imagine being part of a server community and not just playing a solo game.
---
If you like Madseasonshow, you will also like Frostadamus and Classic Winds. They both have a very similar style and produce high quality content.  
---
Just giving these guys a shout out too. They deserve all the love they can get.
---
how is his youtube content okay? hes constantly wrong, spreading lies about stuff he doesn't understand.

 **&lt;Hope&gt; NA | Horde | PvE | Semi-Hardcore** 
---
**Introduction:** Though **&lt;Hope&gt;** is recently formed, we are a guild that has been planned for roughly a year now and are now beginning recruitment for the release of Classic. Our leadership is experienced in raiding and raid leading and we will likely be pushing for server firsts after Molten Core and Onyxia have been cleared. Our current playerbase is composed mainly of individuals located in the CST time zone but all are welcome.  
---
**Member Expectations:** Currently we are looking for active and eager individuals who will focus heavily on raiding endgame. We want players who will seek the best from their characters and can do so in a flexible manner. Consistency, commitment, and hope are the staples of our guild and anyone interested in joining should possess those traits. Socials and levelers are always welcome to join!  
---
**Raid Schedule:** Our current raid schedule is tentative and is as follows: 
---
Tuesday/Thursday - 8:30pm CST - 11:30pm CST
---
Tuesday/Thursday - 6:30pm PST - 9:30pm PST
---
Tuesday/Thursday - 9:30pm EST - 12:30pm EST 
---
Potential Raiding on Saturdays with the same times. It is important to note that these dates/times will be subject to change as the guild grows. These times are reserved as raiding times and all raiders that are on the roster for the day should be online or available through discord(if on reserves). 
---
 If you are interested in joining, or desire more information, please join our discord using the link below: [https://discord.gg/6Y57NR4](https://discord.gg/6Y57NR4)   
---
You may also PM me, Thellon#8607
---
Why are you so shure? :)
---
Reading your response again I think we are talking past each other. Sorry ma dude.
---
/r/thatHappened
---
I subscribed just for a chance at beta and I'm sure a lot of people did the same.
---
If they're not likeable, how come they have so many viewers?
---
I stopped using Fetch to loot mobs because it took longer than actually walking the corpse and manually looting. 
---
Also stopped using Felhunter as a Warlock in PvP because the interrupt is very unreliable.
---
I’m pretty sure he just needs to own the game (20$) and then have an active sub (15$).
---
Yup. And sometimes it was [just for the fun of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riY_yh6e9Xc)
---
Madseasonshow doesn't plan on streaming.
---
There are fury warriors that use 2H. Aside from Dual Wield Specialization, fury talents don't really restrict themselves to DW - they are just really strong dps talents. In general, if you don't have enough hit 2H fury is better than DW fury or if you get your hands on a 2H that is really strong compared to your DW weapons then 2H is also preferred.
---
You also seem to mostly focus on PvE, but remember in PvP some classes will use 2H that they wouldn't in PvE. Overall all the specs that use 2H are:
---
* Fury warrior (sometimes)
---
* Arms warrior
---
* Ret paladin
---
* Enhancement shaman (Nightfall in PvE, 2H in PvP) 
---
* Survival hunter (niche, used for Nightfall bot)
---
* Marksmanship hunter (melee weaving, if you choose to do so)
---
I'll probably get a threat meter and some other basic essentials but I'm going to try avoid anything too modern, I dont like the idea of WeakAuras and that in Classic.
---
You don't keybind everything -_-
---
Nope, that’s a private server speculation and is hotly contested. +5 weapon skill is equivalent to 0.2% +hit whether you’re at 305 or 310.
---
This type of addon needs to die, LFR type raids and groups help make retail a bad game. (queue viewer).
---
To be fair I’ll probably start without addons, then when real raiding starts I’ll put them on so I don’t screw up other people.
---
Iirc, i was the one of the only ones in my guild who got loot from naxx in vanilla.
---
It was a few weeks before tbc launch and i spent all of my dkp on t3 bracers that i never turned in, still have the thing in my bank.
---
Things Blizzard said were "Not going to happen."
---
&gt;Dual spec,
---
&gt;Transmog,
---
&gt;Server transfers/etc,
---
&gt;a cash shop of some form, 
---
Classic WoW, and some other things.
---
and yet, here we are. All of the above has happened.
---
The answer to this is offering all expansions at the same time. You could ultimately select your content on different characters to keep you hooked on the game basically forever.
---
thats level 10 right? If so i can always backtrack to do the quest then rejoin my group after
---
Seriously. I think everyone stepped into first WF expecting pvp. You know what they do have tho? A rotating brawl where it's just 40 vs 40. Ffs
---
Warfronts are the perfection of PvP, it's "just like PvP" but the players always win!
---
false.
---
 [https://imgur.com/cBRwnyd](https://imgur.com/cBRwnyd)
---
Nah I mean based on twitter there’s a lot of reasons people don’t care. 
---
There’s an insane amount of players who love transmog for example (I hate it personally). Others who love their goblins or pandas or being able to change their character looks, etc. 
---
Those people are vocal about not going back to classic because they like those features, not because classic is too hard. 
---
Crazy people tho if you ask me :)
---
im surprised this didnt make it to the front page 
---
its well edited has that epic feel, the video also tells a story pretty well
---
i think its easily the best content so far to come out of the beta
---
maybe a treath meter, but thats all....
---
Cheers, enjoy!
---
Yes it is Darkspear. I got High Warlord back in the day so if you did any PVP I'm sure you know me haha. Name was Rathma and mostly ran in Downfall and Remnant as my guilds. :)
---
Maybe enemyCastBar and a threat meter.
---
People shouldnt use quest addon. Each QOL addon (exept visual) are bad for Vanilia.
---
Umm, source?
---
Oh dear the torture. Lol lost many hours of sleep playing that game over many years.
---
lulz
---
Yes fck tmogs i wanna se all those shamans in turquoise dresses.
---
Get on your knees and start sucking
---
For raids people kind of blow the whole "Warriors without amazing gear suck" thing. They do really great DPS starting from MC and they often top the charts even then. People have the idea that they suck around MC but ramp up in BWL or AQ, but they're just amazing from the get go.
---
My only piece of advice for aspiring DPS Warrios is be prepared to tank sometimes. You're not going to need to swap to Prot spec or anything like that, but there will be times when you might need to OT or something. It always weirds me out a bit when someone rolls the defacto tank class and refuses to tank ever even for 10 mins like it would sully his good name.
---
there’s really nothing you or I can do besides hope to be lucky enough. in a beta like this where there are no keys, it’s all about whether they flag your account or not.
---
best of luck.
---
huh, really?  The anecdotal evidence so far seemed to be leaning towards it.
---
Welp, back to hoping for some luck then...though im probably screwed as well on that front lol
---
em, if there was a way, I wouldn't nor most wouldn't be here posting :)
---
Please stop, I can only get so hyped for Classic.
---
Dammit I love this game.
---
I'd like to see this also! You also don't need to unstuck, you can just head left around the wall jumping over a little hill. :)
---
Yes. I subbed right after I saw you needed a sub. Got invite in 2nd wave
---
Just watch Preach's videos of tanking RFC and WC, he misses stuff all the time and almost dies several times. The damage seems fine in those videos at least.
---
The best I saw was an add-on that re-implemented the LFG tool.
---
I'm assuming it was a troll, but holy shit, that was a high effort troll.
---
Only posted 10 minutes ago, give it time.
---
Guys, what are the servers going to be anyway? US - EU, or US  - Germany, UK, France, Italy etc? In Retail it was the latter one, but I don't know about classic.
---
dont get me wrong i highly doubt it would happen but that's the only reason i can see for them to change anything at all
---
More likely they wait a few days after launch so they can get ahead by a few levels before their "community" floods the server and makes it basically unplayable.
---
don't worry, there's plenty of incentive being able to gank a streamer.
---
You have to dl pserver client, go to stratholme, go to rivendare, and kite him around the circle 5 times forward and backwards.
---
Played way to much in vanilla, did TM VS SS a lot and raids against alliance cities. Not saying streamers don't help start them now but the weren't needed back then.
---
I think there is a Luna version in the works too, i fucked up my private server ui because i downloaded the wrong branch (classic vs 1.12) once. :P
---
I would argue there's also reason to separate 5 and 6 a little more than the others, those two really start some snowballing from PvE gear.
---
nah was posted earlier today shrug
---
i love the pet/mount system and the transmog system but there is no place for it in classic at the moment you start adding these features it stops being classic and becomes something else
---
Reaching r14 in a post-pserver world will be a lot different from ranking back then.
---
Back then you just had to play a lot, now you have to get into the whole emerged meta/subculture and dodge like a motherfucker.
---
I don't see Swifty being the kind of guy committed enough to get it.
---
No, we had realm forums back then(that mattered). And it was fun. So lets say you have a guy in your group that you found on your lfg addon in 5 minutes, first pull, he fucked up. What do you do? 
---
Do you kick him and find another person right away in your addon? Or do you actually try to talk to him and teach him because finding another person is actually harder? And with that making another person better in the game and forming a somewhat bond with that person? 
---
I don’t know man, i prefer the second option, but if blizzard doesn’t stop this, that lfg tool is gonna be like, LFG RFC you need to have at least 3 blue items, need to link your retail ahead of the curve achievements, armory link, your past 6 months of dmg logs and raider.io link and birth certificate to make sure you are “adult”. Yeah, it will come to that because it is so easy and convenient to find people through that addon.
---
With a 2500 or so server cap even smaller streamers can be big enough to ruin a server and make any area they go to unplayable.
---
Same. Using the hunter pet is so essential to the class that any bugs or retail changes will make a noticeable difference in how the class plays. If it’s enough for me to notice, it could push me to not main hunter this time.
---
Paladins can’t use maces. Everyone knows this.
---
I'll buy a poster, $30
---
asmongold fucking noob
---
"laser"
---
&gt; Are you upgrading your setups? 
---
Heh I will actually lower settings - blob shadows and old water - than I play on live.
---
Why include the gold farmers?
---
There is no way to do what you want unless you can personally connect with Blizzard and convince them to give it to you. Hell even those streamers can't get their friends into the game and have people bugging them every day to talk to Blizzard for them.
---
Just gonna have to wait and gamble that $15 like every other sucker
---
Same, I'm thinking maybe auto attack timer threat and maybe cast bar, but that's it. (Maybe cartographer idk)
---
If it's like in the video from OP, it's already hard to play with. I hope they fix it before classic comes out.
---
5 days played dosne not = actual week time, you have to sleep sometime XD
---
I agree but it seems to be the unpopular opinion. These items were obtained outside the game so I agree that TCG should be included as well. But then you are on a trend and where does it stop. Should have never been included in the first place!
---
Server caps will likely be vanilla (2500-3K) so even smaller streamers can have big enough followings to wreck a server and make it unplayable when they are on.
---
Deer Omar, I pray to you that Classic will be as little politically correct as this comment. Amen.
---
Just keep downvoting all of the posts sucking streamers' cocks.  This sub is already being overrun with them.
---
I achieved nothing until WotLK and I'm going to keep it that way #NOCHANGES
---
I would consider the TBC pre-patch (with all of the TBC additions) to be TBC, not vanilla.
---
He also got the R12 gear even though he didn't reach that rank, since you could buy it with honor + marks in the pre-patch
---
666 heal illuminaty confirmed
---
mage is so op for mass pvp...
---
I remember when the LFG system was implemented in WotLK and started warning my friends of where that road was going. "It's going to turn the world into a glorified lobby. Dungeons will feel disconnected from the rest of the world. It will enforce strict group compositions. You won't know anyone in your groups." I was told by my friends that I worry too much and that it actually makes it easier for everyone to experience what was always my favourite PvE content: dungeons. I stand by what I said then.
---
The Blizzard style LFG system would be anathema to the Classic WoW experience. Blizzard did not simply say they would not add LFG, they were bluntly dismissive of the idea of it. I cheered at that.
---
However, this add-on does not worry me all that much. It definitely has its problems, but biggest problems associated with the WotLK LFG system were cross-realm groups and instant teleportation to the instance. *This add-on is incapable of either of those things*.
---
The only thing it has the potential to skip is having to message people in major cities to ask if they are interested in joining your group. That is definitely a problem. However, given that it can only find people on your realm, I would not be surprised if it still required the traditional manual search. Not everyone who is potentially interested in doing a dungeon, that is the right level, class or spec will be sat in a queue on this third-party add-on.
---
This is definitely a concern, I just have not yet been convinced that the sky is falling.
---
definitely making a post on reddit is going to help

Have you seen this boy?
---
Alliance guilds HATE him.
---
Uhhhhm... I think you have those confused. I can go play my warlock in bfa and i'm pressing more buttons than any 3 classes in vanilla combined. How can you say Classic is rotation and combo focused when I can look at my same class in classic and think "sweet, curse of elements and shadow bolt. That's it". Look I love classic and hate BFA just like anyone else but i'm not going to pretend like classic was more complex, cause its WAY more simple. But sometimes, simple is good.
---
They'll probably remove the functionality for those addons, but even still people will find a way to mage looking for groups easier that Blizzard cant control. Even if its just a realm wide LFG Discord channel.
---
I've seen streamers say its between 4 and 7 GB.
---
All of the servers will be flooded. A LOT of people will try actively avoid them.
---
I hesitated clicking it after reading your comment.
---
I'd dare to say more
---
While true, we have the sperg-guilds like APES that can just as well hold a whole server hostage/warp it around them.
---
Thank you, some god damn reason in a sea of "group finder = bad ree."
---
Why would people do that, this is one of the reason people dislike retail...
---
Going to play with some sort of questhelper, something that tracks the mining nodes ive mined on the map. And something line elv ui and bartender I guess. Hmm and something that sells grey items automatically when I talk to a vendor. That’s about it :)
---
Is leeway an actual thing and not just the lag between you to the server and the enemy to the server being calculated?
---
I've been playing back and forward since tbc. But now that I'm older and don't have as much time I'm probably gonna get the add-ons I need to maximize the efficiency of my playtime. Prolly gonna get some quest add-ons and stuff like that
---
Can we get that sexy Classic SpartanUI please?
---
How do you do that?
---
Play what you want and enjoy it don't worry about min/maxing too much. While classic wow closes each have niches and they are not balanced I think every class will be viable in their own way. Mage is a great choice though.
---
Remember that osrs and wow are different games. I love both and play OSRS daily. Osrs is focused more on solo player skills and training. While wow is more focused on group content and getting to max level to pve/pvp (although the leveling process is fun and rewarding, wow is still an endgame focused mmo)
---
One thing you're going to notice is that quests in wow are pretty much just tasks to give you XP. OSRS has some of the best questing in my opinion, they are unique, give good rewards and often give access to new training methods or a new area or something exciting. In wow there are only a couple quest lines that really make you feel like you're changing the world or unlocking something really great, even in classic wow.
---
They could be worse.  They could be island expeditions.  At least we can just AFK the whole thing in a warfront.
---
It was nice when you could get BiS because you knew you had the best. Like you said, now someone else could have a much better piece than you from the same damn raid. 
---
It’s like they have everyone running on a treadmill trying to catch the carrot whereas before you were trail running and if you were good you could actually get an end game reward.
---
I miss the days of “oh I need to run xyz so I can get abc weapon.” Now it’s “oh I need to run xyz so I have a chance to get abc weapon and the only after that will I need lmnop to happen so I can get titanforged BiS. What’s that? It could’ve had a socket too? *fuck*.”
---
Absolutely they do! It’s the best of both world’s which is why it confuses my why anyone would ever play a non PvP server.
---
I rather see Mage overpopulated than Lock tbh.
---
Using a bulletin board forum was never effective for finding dungeon groups.
---
i think i will do what i done in vanilla and level 1-60 without addons, granted then it was because i didn't have a clue what an addon was, but some of the raid QoL addons just make life easier in the long run.
---
does anyone know if the addon system is the one that blocked things like the original decursive working as that really separated the mage and druid players when they stopped it working pre-TBC
---
I wish you were alliance, you guys sound fun lol.
---
probably. Dont know many 12s with 2k io
---
They still have big bgs in though?
---
I'm gonna add some for sure. UI, swing timer, etc. Gonna stay away from Quest helper addons for sure, very against my idea of the Classic WoW experience.
---
Are they viable for dungeon healing near max level? Like, can I heal BRS or BRD at appropriate gear?
---
I lol'ed

&gt;We'll see week 1 raid clears from top guilds.

That's actually really crap :( I remember when clearing raids took weeks to do!
---
The one addon i truly cannot play without.  It was one of the first i ever downloaded, and i just cant *stand* having multiple bags since then x_x;
---
There will be a lot of people who are clueless on addons and how to find this sort of information, there will also be people that use addons. Its literally the same as in vanilla
---
I did the same.
---
Exactly this. 
---
People argue that if QuestHelper was blocked, then people would just tab out and go look up quest guides to do the quests quicker - which is annoying so why not just allow QuestHelper Addons?
---
Well, while that is true, you could also say the same about Dungeon Finder. It's pretty unanimous that Dungeon Finder is hated in the Classic community, however, there's nothing stopping 3rd party sites to help people group up for dungeons. It's the same thing. Both are pretty game-changing QOL addons, yet one is hated and one is accepted.
---
And if you don't think QuestHelper like addons change the game too much then you're stupid. Of course it affects the game. People mindlessly complete quests at a much faster pace which directly affects the economy of the realm. People should complete quests quicker due to game knowledge, not through an Addon.
---
http://prntscr.com/nqygw5
---
This was so.
---
I argue the other way - the longer they stretch out the 6 planned patches the more time they have to plan the unplanned way to keep us involved after Naxx
---
Because earlier expansion are more pvp oriented so ppl who play pve continued to play retail but pvpers went to play classic private servers 
---
That's why majority of private servers are pvp
---
was playing about on a private server and found myself just clicking through quests only to suddenly be reminded there was nothing back then not even a mark on your map as to where the quest was, luckily i remember where most of them where with a little mental poking
---
Only three addons for me.
---
1. I'll play hunter so I want an auto attack timer, as that is the bread and butter of optimizing the rotation - which to be is the most fun rotation in vanilla. So this addon directly makes gameplay more fun to me.
---
2. Then I'll have a dps meter because I know I won't obsess about it, but I like seeing my dps and improving myself. I also find a light competition in dungeons helps pushing you to do better, which is great for the whole group.
---
3. Atlas Loot. I already know most of the upgrades worthy, there is no "mystery of new items" left for me, so this basically just saves me time I would otherwise spend on a website when I'm foggy on a few details about an item.
---
What? Madseasonshow isn't playing on US?
---
So each stress test will greatly increase the amount of players in beta
---
and Nobbel and chunk of method players
---
Warrior is trash even with gear, you'll always have to depend on someone else to be good. 
---
It doesnt matter if you deal the highest damage if you cant survive. I think this is the biggest take away from this, when I see a warrior, I see an easy kill regardless which class I'm playing.
---
Afaik you dont need BFA to play classic just a sub. I'd recommend trying to make an EU starter account and when your ready to start adding time for classic add it to that account. This will save you from having to pay any extra money besides the sub fee unless you want to play classic. The link i added below mentions how to go about adding an EU account.

The big name text over their head will probably give a not so subtle clue to their location.

*They could not live with their own failure. And where did that bring them? Back to Classic. I thought by eliminating half of tedium, the other half would thrive, but you've shown me... that's impossible. As long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.*
---
All black qiraji beetle mounts will go to some e-celebs on every server who have a giant whiteknight guild around them.  They'll also get the first thunderfury etc. funneled to them. 
---
Enjoy!
---
IMO there are a lot of vanilla elitists pushing for the no-addon gameplay. If they want to do that, that's fine on them and they can play how they want; but I'd appreciate it if they got off their high horse.
---
DPS meters, threat meters, swing timers, inventory UIs, AH UIs, mailbox UIs, quest log UIs, healbot, vendor price addons, dungeon loot guides, etc. aren't going to add a single negative thing to the game for me. I get people who want to play without a quest helper, sure, but I've leveled enough characters that it's just smoother leveling for me. I won't be reading quests and trying to figure thing out, I'll just be trying to remember which quest this is and whether or not this one mob with a slightly different name can also drop quest items.
---
Personally I love the customization and optimization of addons, and it's a huge part of the game for me. I'd honestly feel more like I was missing out *not* using them.
---
that's true, but as soon as their fans find their server you will have a glut of extra people trying to get there. By delaying they are able to get maybe a little ahead of the pack before everyone joins and swarms any zone they are in.
---
Yeah and by benefit he means every once in a while you'll spend 20 to an hour minutes running to your corpse because camping people is fun right?

I did play on darkspear alliance for awhile but I ended up rerolling with two other people and I almost feel like one of them was a friend of yours or something.
---
What. Call this a low effort meme but not the one on the front page?
---
I still watch him but agree that he's gotten worse with that.  Maybe it's his popularity growth, but also I think because of how much he's had to milk WoW for content he leans heavier on those as overcompensation.  He used to do it far more seldom, so it was actually clever and you couldn't actually tell if he was serious.
---
Rank climb all day.
---
I used healbot for a long time (it was what i started with, so it was just what i was used to and i dont like change really).
---
I ended up going with vuhdo for a while at least, though now im trying to remember if thats what im currently using on retail or not....its been a while since ive done any healing &gt;.&lt;
---
I will probably start without add-ons and gauge which UI elements are actively frustrating for me before adding anything.
---
I know a couple other streamers said this as well, but I know a couple will be sucking up the gold from their community in a heart beat.
---
pretty sure there was something like this at some point but it was more it just pooled all the people using it and put a mark next to them if they were looking for a certain dungeon/raid and you could whisper them through the addon dont think that was in vanilla though.
---
Actually a good question
---
Yes but I cannot switch back to an NA account when I am relocated to the US, this is my problem

On the flip side he tends to get really into it (especially then), it's often a persona after all

I’m thinking the same sat this point.
---
Warfront is not even pvp
---
I’ve tested it in the Beta and you actually can make a macro to Pick Pocket + Stealth opener.
---
/cast Pick Pocket
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
Replace SS with your opener of choice. Using that macro, you will very briefly see the loot window flash by as you’re attacking, and then oddly enough you’ll hear the loot sound a second or two into battle.
---
Having said that, Pick Pocket in general seems a little flaky. I’ve clicked Pick Pocket by itself before and had nothing happen, then try again and it works. Same with the macro, except when that fails you’re already in combat so you don’t get a chance at a 2nd try. Might be a lag issue, out of range or perhaps something else.
---
As far as loot, I’ve been getting 1-2 copper and the occasional junk item or Minor Healing Potion so far in the 1-10 areas. No quest items or anything else of significant value.
---
&gt; they had a better crafted narrative than the current season of GoT.
---
well, not sure that's terribly hard at this point
---
Who the fuck cares? These anti streamer posts are more annoying than streamers, which takes a lot.
---
Tipsout is my only issue, really pompous bitch boy attitude
---
"murlock"...
---
This triggers me every time.
---
Why would you not research the actual information instead of asking randos on the internet?
---
You can have 3rd party group finders on your 2nd monitor too that accomplish the exact same thing - but I guess you don't want dungeon finder in Classic?
---
Skill matters, but the way you worded your gameplay is anything but correct threat wise.
---
I haven't played since WOD and I would really appreciate if you could upload a BFA video showing similar amounts of lag. I think this could be one of many unintended effects of trying to implement spell batching. As far as I understand, spell batching in 2019 Classic is essentially an attempt to emulate the technical imperfections of 2005 on a modern/optimised client.
---
 Someone offered to lend me the account to try the beta. Thanks Reddit
---
How annoying is it if a shaman is rocking 30/0/21? I really don’t wana respec every day. Hoping a deep Resto spec isn’t needed until like Naxx progression.
---
It should be quality over quantity.
---
Those guards where insane. Full raid bosses that wouldn’t stop chasing for seemingly any reason. That spawned by the dozens. Even the game knows alliance needs all the help thy can get with their puny arms and tiny legs. Given enough time the horde will always come out on top. 
---
For the horde!!

No need to be so damn salty. The only requirement is that you have an active sub. Besides that, it’s xompletely random.

Putting your pet on defensive will get you flamed in dungeons. Pets on defensive is why hunters are known for wiping groups, any hunter that is within earshot of being a decent player always has their pet on defensive.

You have to explore the world and find people to hunt down and fight.
---
Yea, kinda weird post. Homie first tries to say there are only 3 big wow streamers, then immediately lists six more.
---
As far as we know, WoW servers were (and will be) capped around 3K players. To me that means even a streamer with 100-200 viewers is going to have the potential to seriously impact realms.
---
Asmon probably my favorite WoW streamer but good god does he wine like no other. Saturday he got ganked 1 time...yes 1... and complains how it's not fun when he is "constantly" getting ganked. Then this happened yesterday....I think It was when both sides had roughly \~30 people and he was saying they can't win when there are 70-80 horde attacking them....
---
Then you clearly didnt play during vanilla tarren mill vs southshore
---
At least there's a loss condition on island expeditions. I'm not aware that you can lose a warfront.
---
I really hope the guy complaining about weapon leveling just stays away from the game
---
He's quickly becoming my favourite streamer
---
From all the wording I've seen at least it should work this way. Also as a side note it shouldn't require a BFA account per se just any active WoW account.
---
BIG-ASS BACKPACK SWOPE
---
Nice. Havent checked up on him in a few weeks. WIll watch thanks
---
Haven't they literally said they might do that if there's community support, but they just haven't planned that far ahead?
---
It's definitely a non-zero chance. We'll have to see what happens a couple years from now, they wouldn't do anything faster than that anyway. Just sit back, enjoy the game, and quit if you don't like what they end up doing years down the road and switch back to private servers.
---
Beautiful
---
just looking at seems it was added in 2.3 so burning crusade
---
This has long been an issue with Blizzard development, a misunderstanding of why people do things.  The first time I really noticed it was towards the end of TBC, in their defense, or maybe how they sold making every raid 10 and 25 in Wrath they brought up that Kara was far and away the most popular raid zone in TBC, that more people did it than any other raid.  I remember reading this, and all I could think was, of fucking course it was, it was the entry raid and required as part of the attunement to actually start raiding.  Was the other 10 man raid that was not part of any attunement as popular, no of course not, but they have had an issue for a long time of taking the wrong lessons from things.
---
This is just moving trade chat spam to a GUI interface. It's fine.
---
Spamming trade chat to find groups wasn't what made vanilla great, it was what happened after you had joined the group.
---
Are you a laptop sales rep or something?  Why so defensive bud?
---
My point is you get to a certain point with a laptop that it isn't really any more convenient for someone like myself who is living in a hotel for weeks at a time, than just bringing my tower with me.  It's not like I'm sitting in my truck on my lunch break trying to squeeze game time in where a laptop actually might be useful.
---
Careful, just the mere mention of Towelliee here on Reddit is like a bat signal to summon him. The guy has a very fragile ego and while other streamers on here would just ignore the comment, Towelliee will make sure to let you know the 6 figures he makes a year, how much classic will suck (but plays it everyday) and how many subs he has...
---
Taming Broken Tooth in Badlands after like a month and destroying every casters in PvP was surely a highlight of vanilla.

I'll bite. Fury is the best dps in the game.
---
Sounds about right. One per sub
---
Not playing  it
---
I'd like to go without AddOns, but I also want to be able to move my bars around. 
---
Will probably cave at level 20-30.
---
Worse than Ashran? 
---
WOD was the last time I subbed (for about 3 months) and Ashran was the worst PVP idea up until that point in history
---
Don't you dare interrupt the circlejerk! 
---
No argument from me on that. Doesn't change the harassment that those with beta access face.
---
Fury was always an inferior rogue on just about every fight. They certainly had their place, having one was beneficial, but could never replace a rogue 1 for 1 without outgearing them greatly.
---
This. Work to Grand Marshal, get the brilliant title :)
---
Or stinking HIGH WARLORD.
---
Whichever.
---
You won't do rated, but you can still stomp on noobs and that's fun as hell. Challenge will still be there too. Plus, there's a lot of world pvp in general
---
I say let him look like a hypocrite. More publicity for the game should be a good thing.
---
Wait how what?
---
Is that common in classic? Sorry I never played vanilla
---
I was thinking about the nameplate above enemies head in the world when you hit CTLR+V, but no worries, I can just look into it later, atleast the main castbar works :P Ty for help!

Don't forget the Night-Elf Wetlands death run!

They work fine unless you want to be a top 10 prog guild
---
There was an interview and they said it’s possible to add post naxx content, if WE want.
---
Too much risk and work. 
---
As far as classic WoW goes I think blizzard should keep everything original, in 2 years they can release tbc servers and let people copy their classic wow characters top the TBC servers and players can keep playing classic if they want.  As far as what I hear and see this is what's going to happen. 
---
As far as a game with new content I think blizzard should create WoW 2. They could keep WoW around in its retail form aswell as keep progressing through the classic versions of the game aswell. But I think starting from scratch would be an awesome thing. They could create an entire new MMO in the warcraft universe and introduce features that people have wanted in wow but just wouldn't work.
---
Tips is the guy who will be ninja looting everything and laughing about it while his 'community' will be praising and defending his toxic attitude. I hope the server he ends up playing on basically excommunicates him from raids, but we all know even if that happens his followers will invite him to raid/dungeon groups they make anyway.
---
Just envisioning me tanking rag, and illidan, and arthas.. :0
---
Yeah, its definitely possible... this is just my opinion.
---
Oh, is this sodappopin the same Soda that played multiple blizzcons as Resto Druid and Disc Priest?
---
If so, I LOVED whatching that guy play. He was so skilled, multiple times he wasbasically OOM but managed to hell all of his team and turn the tides of a losing match...
---
I always tought it was 2 different guys so I never payed his stream any attention. If it's the same guy I have someone to follow on twtich now.
---
Easily
---
I will run a few UI, all in one bag, loot list, carbonite style map addon and TRP (hope we get a RPPVP server) And a threat/damage meter.
---
wrong
---
I'd imagine with a high end laptop, you need your dedicated power out because your battery is going to get slurped up in no time, video out because I'm living out of a hotel for work for weeks at a time, so why not use the bigger screen, mouse, etc.
---
It gets to a point where packing up my 25lb tower seems like a very minor inconvenience over spending a few thousand on a capable laptop, you know?  It also helps that I drive rather than fly to our out of town jobsites, so packing a bunch of creature comforts isn't a big deal.
---
Is the pvp rank system in phase 1?
---
that stuff won't be in launch , right?
---
Yeah a 2.5 year plan for phases is insane... There'll be months of downtime between phases, as it will only take most raiders a couple months to get content on farm. There's no reason to stretch it out that long, we won't need 6 months for every single raid.
---
This meme would make sense if Warfronts were PvP. Instead of a free loot machine that your entire team has to actively try to lose.
---
Y'all took the bait
---
This could be because we got better at the game, as people, also, we have a lot more information to the point that we can access anything ever discovered on the Internet which makes us better than we were back then. For example, I totally did not know warrior sought spirit, I heard about it but my English was bad and my comprehension not much better as a 16 year old, and just BabyRaged at them needing my gear xD
---
I swear somewhere during the original announcement Blizzard said you would have to have the newest expansion and active sub. Maybe I “misremembered” that or they backed off. 
---
But it could be real shitty of them if they make you buy expansions in the future just to keep access to Classic.
---
That could happen in layering too though. Since layers are continent wide, if the population was big enough (which it would be given they would be on a streamer filled server after launch), it's entirely possible they would be on different layers.
---
Expensive skill cheap mounts in 1.12.
---
Ugly af tbh
---
Seeing it made me 10x more excited for Classic. It's the ultimate healing tool and just confirmed for me that I will be healing for sure now in classic.
---
5-8 mil.
---
I just want ELVUI honestly.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
And Classic fans tend to have this weird aura of pretending to be elite about them.
---
 [https://imgur.com/cBRwnyd](https://imgur.com/cBRwnyd) 
---
No, they havent said that (referring to making changes to vanilla) but may consider later expansions.
---
There is a 0% chance.
---
same here, reported as well.
---
It’s at level 10 but I’m not sure if it’s like a quest than just instantly pops up or you have to teleport to moonglade or something. I’d wait until you learn how to teleport to moonglade just to be safe but who knows you honestly could be completely fine
---
the only quests race bound are the level 10 hunter taming quest
---
I raided hardcore from 2005-2012 and this was never the case. Dont get me wrong, some guilds "may" do it or allow it, but I've never seen a shadowpriest be a Main healer in a raid. We cleared, MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/AQ40 and 2 wings of Naxx before tBC was released and I never heard of a shadow priest being a main healer. Same in  TBC and Wrath.  
---
I've never played on a private server, so maybe they were different.
---
Almost stereo typically neckbeard, isn't it ?
---
These idiots completely miss the point. "Streamer server" is just the big fish. No one gives a shit about a small time streamer playing on their server. They refuse to admit theyre going to ruin the classic experience for themselves and others. They care about self-promotion and not the community.
---
Streamers are awesome!!!!! *NNNNGGG*
---
Ahh... nutted.

Them needing on EVERY fucking piece that drops is pissing me off.

---
Tue a possible 3rd day in Phase 4 with the release of 20 man content.
---
We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere.
---
While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community. 
---
Outside of our raider ranks, we are very open to accepting casual players that want to be apart of the guild and help us build our community. We also expect there to be a good deal of organized PvP going on as several members have confessed their love of PvP. So if you want to join to hang out and play with us, do not hesitate to drop us a message. 
---
We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be “pre-raid” raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other.
---
We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.

---
I think you had the right of it when you said community. Sure, the *entirety* of any community isn't toxic, but without self moderation the community will never really be fixed. Vanilla offers that self moderation because of the time investment. You NEED that community to succeed in Vanilla, and if you've put in the massive amount of time to get to 60, you're not going to throw it all away just to be a troll. Ninja looters are dealt with. Scumbags are dealt with. There is no easy out.  
---
I think toxicity derives from the lack of reinforcement. You queue up in Overwatch, you play poorly, you act like a jerk, your group doesn't like you, then win or lose, you just queue up again like nothing happened. You queue up for raid finder, you play poorly, you act like a jerk, you clear the raid and get your gear regardless. You spend an hour spamming "DPS LFG for BRD" in Ironforge, you act like a jerk, you get kicked, your group moves on without you, you're back where you started. The community polices itself.
---
Ah damn I had completely suppressed that memory. Curse you for bringing it to my attention.
---
They already confirmed they won't use the 1.12 system for mounts though.
---
It's going to be cheap skill (a different one for each faction) and expensive mount.
---
I can tell you the exact same thing about Bloodscalp. It was mostly dutch and hungarian, but eventually got overrun with hungarian chat which caused the server's population to slowly decrease till there was literally nothing left.
---
You people are inflating Classic a bit too much
---
gank lowbies
---
There may be longer fights way before Naxx and during naxx you will have 5T2.5 + 3T2 :\] The key is mana potion addiction and then dark runes addiction. If you start using them on cooldown when you loose as much mana as it can return then you will be able to last long fights rather easily.
---
Also it will depend what the Ele use will be - some mobs will be resistant to nature damange, which is kind of annying.
---
realistically that addon wouldnt even be harmful, it's not like it would work cross server
---
Epic jew XD
---
This. exactly. The entire time during BFA alpha and beta I always thought these would actually have a PVP option as in a cooler Ashran or Wintergrasp only to find out at launch that this is just AI PVE lameness.
---
lol, thats what i was kind of going to say.  How many of the people that would have subbed when Classic launched (well, two weeks early to reserve names) are subbing now just to try to get into the beta :P
---
Yes totally.  50g isnt a big ask, once you are level 60 and have your epic mount. 
---
I used to spend 1 evening farming, and could make as much as 500-600g (4hrs or so farming), that'd pay for any respec, enchants, consumables I needed to raided and pvp with. Also, funded any gear and stuff needed for alts.
---
do you have a source for that as i have not seen anything.
---
Ah sorry I'm not playing the beta much atm just wanted to test out the addons and see if they worked :)
---
Depends on the phase, as more PvP content is added throughout patches.
---
Phase 1 will have absolutely no PvP systems whatsoever. Most people will be leveling for a lot of this phase, so pre-60 wPvP is the big one here. As people get to 60 there will be wPvP with no focus on any gains, meaning just whatever fights are fun to people.
---
Phase 2 introduce the honor system and PvP ranks. This means people will in addition to playing wPvP for fun also try to do things that earns them honor, which might be slightly different types of battles. The cool thing about the first two phases is that there is no need for a dedicated PvP zone, it will naturally happen throughout the world - but a few zones will lend themselves naturally to wPvP, for example zones that have a lot of players due to other things (like raid entrances or lvl 60 farming spots).
---
Phase 3 adds two battlegrounds, Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley. While there are no ranked, look at WSG as the "ranking BG". This is because people make premades here. It is not the same as ranked BG's on retail, but it where people use tactics and work as a group - only instead of rating people fight for honor points. AV is the big scale battle that goes on for a long time (although not as insane as early vanilla).
---
Phase 4 adds Arathi Basin - this is mostly just like running random BG's.
---
Phase 5 doesn't bring any PvP content. Maybe updated rewards to add continuously PvP progression.
---
Phase 6 adds wPvP in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands. This is kind of vanillas version of Wintergrasp, but it is not something you queue for - it is maybe more like the PvP objectives in some of the TBC zones like Hellfire Peninsula.
---
It should also be noted that you use both honor points and BG marks to buy PvP gear, so you have more of a reason to run different BG's compared to retail. This means it feels like you have an objective by going to a specific BG. Also, even in later phases when more PvP content is added, general wPvP is still quite alive. Because there are no sharding or flying mounts and in general more reasons to go out into the world you will see a much different wPvP than in retail.
---
If we're talking about level 30's then the horde had way more but let's be honest they also had the way better players. We're talking about a dozen multi-rank 1 glads against asmond and his band of spergs
---
Unfortunately World PvP raids will get a LOT LESS common once BG's release. The better rewards and higher honor gain win out over the intrinsic fun of world pvp. There were still skirmishes afterwards, but large raids like the streamer fights were commonplace before BG's, and not just at Hillsbrad either.
---
A lot of people have the misconception that flying mounts killed world pvp, but Blizzard was working to diminish it for a long time beforehand. Server crashes were common, as were complaints about not being able to quest (even though players willingly chose pvp servers). They wanted to avoid bad word of mouth from it, and it was a real concern, as they'd already seen it play out in other MMO's like Ultima Online, which lost a lot of its playerbase to Everquest over it's lax pvp rulesets (keep in mind EQ2 came out shortly before WoW did).
---
That's why it's so important to get revolving/resetting **Seasonal Servers.** Even within vanilla, there were windows of time where the dynamics of the game completely change. It'd be a shame for those to be lost forever once Nax releases.
---
Nobody knows  exactly how Blizzard implemented spell batching (a technical imperfection from 2005) on a modern/optimised system. I think this could definitely be an unintended effect of spell batching.
---
That was indeed his choice, but he wanted to split the difference. A feminine name for the character that could still sound masculine.
---
I’m currently working my way through the Beta while updating my quest completionist guide (https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm), recording experience and reputation values for every single quest (SW, IF, GE, D) including spillover rep values (listed as “Sp” in my guide). As of right now, I’ve reached level 13, having completed all level 1-7 quests. Very few quests so far have given spillover rep, but I expect that to change when I get into Loch Modan/Westfall/Darkshore.
---
I think you are missing his point, I believe his point is that, if it's not fixed in live, it's very unlikely to be fixed in classic.  An issue that spans both games, that has not been fixed in live, may not be easily fixable.
---
It is easy for Twitch to make a new section. They did it for Autochess (dota2 mod) so the question is how divided the viewer base for WoW is.
---
rogues get shit on by warriors AQ40+
---
“Wahhh wahhh i don’t like you wahh”
---
I was never gatekeeping. Anyone can play classic all they want. Idc. Theres nothing correlated with gatekeeping and specific groups of players trolling another group of players and falsely reporting bugs that go against their idealism. 
---
I’m simply saying don’t shit on a game and try to cater it to your ideals. I don’t know why you’re getting so offended. Calm down.
---
I think the most exciting time was when our local guild merged into Aurora (after Dares had recently established it). Many of my friends and I (we had like 15 high school friends playing) got to take part in several server first kills and progression races. Some of us broke off near BWL to strictly PVP, while others stayed and kept through to Naxx. 
---
Maybe not a singular achievement, but we were smack dab in the middle of what made Arthas great.
---
Disc for PI is also acceptable. You can still spec into most of the necessary holy talents, just missing out on the extra 10% healing but getting some mana buffs to try and even it out. PI is just so strong.

33 year old with a family, 7-4pm job, and full time daddy duties. I've got raiding experience from Vanilla (MC-&gt;AQ40) all the way through BFA (Heroic Uldir, stopped after that cause I'm not happy with retail atm). I've raided everything from casual all the way through heroic / mythic content. 
---
Looking for a chill guild that I can do some easy raiding with, dungeons, pvp, and just have a good social experience with. My wife also plays and may join me during classic. I'll be rolling as an Orc Rogue :D
---
I'm just enjoying watching this, and remembering all of the people a couple weeks ago not understanding why a beta would even be needed.  The amount of people that really believe this was a simple as booting up a server with 1.12 is astounding.
---
Other healers have a buff to put on the whole raid group. Druid will have draconids hibernate duty, some may also gear towards feral tank. Priest may mana burn and decurse, one may go shadow to boost warlocks.
---
Shagu, who made pfui for pservers, said in the past that he will not be making add-ons for classic, but that was a long time ago and he may have changed his mind.
---
pfui is very comparable to elvui for live wow in *many* ways, and elvui will 100% be ported to classic.
---
Side note: I wouldn't expect many private server add-ons to be ported to classic, as it would be much easier to Port the Legion/BFA versions as they were built using something *much* closer to the modern api classic will be using.
---
I edited my comment and added a source.
---
I am very much aware that I get a better performance/$ ratio. I However do not think you need $600 CPU/Mainboard/RAM for Classic WOW and I will not play other games
---
I think what new MMO need to do to prevent power creep and keep old content relevant is to have gear tiers and bump old gear down a tier until it hit a baseline.
---
It could look something like this...
---
Tier 1 New gear from current raids/pvp - BIS
---
Tier 2 Gear from previous tier - 1 step below BIS
---
Baseline Tier 3 Gear from all old tiers- 2 steps below BIS
---
This would allow all old content to still be viable to people gearing up, it also would allow returning players a starting point so that their old gear is still somewhat relevant. 
---
Of course this is all theory crafting for an entire new game since this isn't how WOW works. But interesting stuff nonetheless
---
I dont know where this no addon shiet comes from, addons existed back in the day but they were not that sophisticated like they are now. I had that shitty xperl addon or w/e it was called and I had damage meter and threat. I also had a add-on called decursive or something as well.
---
Maybe add-on related:
---
Mouseover macros?  I don't remember when I started using them, be it Wrath or Legion (didn't play in between), but healing, decursing, CCing, DoTing, etc are all much more fluid with that functionality.  I won't die without it but I would be happier with it.
---
I'm certain it didn't exist in vanilla but perhaps there was an add-on for it.
---
Leveling in retail is such a chore. A couple years ago (during WoD) me and a buddy leveling from 1 to level cap as a healer and tank. The entire way, all we did was dungeon finder. We COULD have gone and quested... but why? Quest rewards are shittier than dungeon loot and it isn't like there are other players out there questing anyways. If there was a chance for world PvP maybe it would be intriguing but there's not. Players literally sit in the same spot all day waiting for queues to pop.
---
To be honest, I was too Young to keep track of that, heh. But I’ve heard it is at least common enough that a lot of people level it :)
---
Not sure if trolling or not, fury warriors are the best dps at virtually every tier, they get outspsed by mages and warlocks on fights that require movement on the melees part
---
I only need it for classic WoW, won't play any other games 100% guaranteed
---
Yeah but for UK thats midnight which sucks ass, why didnt they release it in the morning US time so then both US/EU get to enjoy launch at a reasonable timeframe.
---
I just can't wait for them to announce which servers they will be on for those of us who want to avoid them like the plague that they will be.
---
&gt;The only thing that really makes that battle unique is the fact everyone is capped at 30.
---
The entire WoW streamer section plus blizzcon champs were in that battle.
---
Don't know why anyone would purposely play with bad graphic, I find that very odd. I'm glad there's an option for it I guess.
---
Currently the beta appears as WoW: Classic on the launcher. You select it from the little drop down box above the Play button. I would imagine that it will appear under there when it goes live but who knows.
---
Not 100% on that. Contested math on glancing penalty. Some say you can never get rid of it. Others say you can bring it down to 0.
---
But who are the method players that will bring flocks of players following them day and night like Asmon or Soda have? Sco?? He said he might mess around with Classic, that it would be fun trying to get world first, but he's not planning on sticking with it, Method is too much helbent on sticking with BfA bc of tournaments
---
Amazing!
---
Mine is pretty similar to yours.  My most memorably achievement was killing Rags. He seemed epic at the time, and we wiped for a few weeks on him as we geared up and farmed FR gear for everyone. But when we killed him, the cheer on the old vent channels was epic....40 folk all cheering and talking. Was an awesome feeling. 
---
We got into Naxx too, but just couldnt get past the 4H men either.  
---
Personal achievements, was also getting to Marshall (Rank 12). 
---
Cant wait to get back to Vanilla.
---
Same here
---
Lol you can keep posting that pic, but it doesn't prove anything. Ofc they are keeping it the same at the start. But that doesn't mean shit for once the phases are over, don't delude yourself into thinking they'll never touch it.
---
Did you try classic wow beta? What did you pay?
---
Phase 1 is likely to only last 2-3 months, while casuals are still leveling. At least this is how private servers do it, no reason to delay DM for half a year.
---
.. because you won’t find a spot since they already have 15 dedicated fury warriors I presume. Since they’re the best dps in game at every raid tier.
---
1,5-2,15 million subs.
---
Fuck those Vile Fin Minor Oracles that Forsaken have to kill at like lvl 8
---
Oh yeah? What was your/their names? Even if you didnt know me back then we can be friends when Classic comes out! So excited to get back in PVP and will be making a guild for sure ASAP. :D
---
the modern equivalent for Luna is Shadowed Unit Frames, so you can probably count on that one being available early on.
---
How else are they going to justify taking 3x your money?
---
Opened 10+ chests in the past 2 days, didn't see the same interaction.
---
Blizzard is opening a name reservation 2 weeks before launch. If it's anything like other games do it, it allows you to pre-make your char with your desired name on it days before the actual launch
---
Oh damn. I didn't realize they were reverting that change, not sure how I feel about that.
---
This doesn't happen for cosmetics that are exclusive to microtransactions. The only problem with that is if there's no way to obtain it without spending real dollars, people complain. I think it's the wrong way to look at it. If you can earn something with time OR money, spending the time usually doesn't amount to anything.
---
Couldn't you enter The Emerald Dream at one point? There's also GM Island, which I always found oddly interesting
---
If an addon is the baseline for group building it should not be available in Classic.   
---
Not everyone knows about this addon or going to use it and in the end those players get excluded from dungeons, raids, etc.  
---
Just spam the LFG channel like we all did, you will find a group.
---
### Create Your Character
---
If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.\*\*Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!
---
&gt;  reported and banned/suspended
---
imagine getting a month ban or even permaban for plotting with the enemy :D
---
 [https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-game-time](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-game-time)
---
yes, but its also more dangerous. having a pws up and max inner fire charges helps a ton vs rogues or anyone opening on you.
---
Keep in mind that nameplates don't show class colors and they're only visible within maybe 20 yards. They just didn't catch him in time.
---
this is the BfA we needed
---
You're going to have to go to Stormwind everytime you want to level new skills.
---
If you're not planning on leveling fast that won't matter. So just go and do the Wetlands run and have fun.
---
Wow must be on that no changes zealotry train. This is clearly good for the game
---
... probably good call reporting it though. Couldn’t imagine melee hunters with quivers
---
He could hide his character name and server he is on for a bit until people realize. Might help with leveling, but he and every streamer will be stream sniped even at 60. People will be waiting outside the raids with bombs to throw on him to remove all world buffs and the like or try to wipe his raid group. 
---
It's shitty, but it's going to happen. Just like how people stream snipe pro players in League and other games, it's the players prerogative to stream and the game is not responsible for people ghosting.
---
It's VERY slow without premade nolifing. WSG will probably take a year if you hover around casual rank 6, and AB may take two, provided people rarely do AB. But I agree with you. Can always BG just because too.
---
Same. If you look at /r/wow you see that the vast majority are positive towards Classic. Certain people in this sub has such a victim complex, and it's really disheartening to see adults acting like this.
---
Threat meter, clique, and something for the UI.
---
But theres rep and pretty sure that has rewards tied to it.
---
It's weird tho, because this interview must have never been recorded or documented. All I can find are people assuming they're even going to step foot into Naxx, and farm it on top of that.
---
... In what alternate reality did you play wow classic?
---
Before the BG was turned into a race, that is where much of the PVP occurred. That was where they would grow in power/size with each enemy player they killed/consumed. It was only "useless" when the BG was nerfed to hell, most of the NPCs were removed, and the Field of Strife became a race track. You have to remember that things like Lok were designed and implemented with the OG AV design in mind, not this watered down zerg race that blizzard has decided to repeat.
---
Hey just wondering what to do if I don’t see a dropdown box?  Do I need to activate it or something?
---
Running a Mac btw and have the sub activated
---
To be fair there's a lot of retards in twitch chat. If I had masses of people constantly being wrong I'd probably start to assume I was always right also. 
---
But I think that's what separates good streamers from bad streamers is putting that aside and actually recognizing when they're wrong.
---
Omar, you were supposed to be the chosen one.
---
Kinda whiffed on that first cone of cold lol
---
I dont watch asmon.
---
But it does make it less AIDSy than a pserver launch with 10-12k crammed in the starting zones.
---
You are doing the same thing
---
because if they add things then its not "as it was." you dont go to a museum and start adding stuff to paintings just because you think it will make it better.
---
Frost tomb is % HP based so they actually made it harder to keep them alive.
---
Then you won’t be using 2 handers
---
It'll be two weeks beforehand. Drops in the 27th and they'll let us get three names on the 13th.
---
# [Horde, EU, PvE server] &lt;The Muffin Vendor&gt;
---
Hello there!
---
“The Muffin Vendor” is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We’re going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn’t mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!
---
**Who are we?**
---
We’re a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I’m sure a lot of others have. We’ve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we’re all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla’s endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
While we have the “basic stepstones” covered (such as a MT and a minimum amount of healers/dpsers), we still have plenty of room for additional people.
---
What we’re looking for are mainly dedicated players. Which means, if you have the passion to keep on playing, and the willingness to show it in your commitment (i.e. show up for raids and group content, bring consumables, improve your game and so on), then you’re the kind of person we want to invite in our guild.
---
**Recruitment status:**
---
Druid - CLOSED
---
Hunter - CLOSED
---
Mage - *Medium*
---
Rogue - Low
---
Priest - *Medium*
---
Shaman - *Medium*
---
Warlock - Low
---
Warrior - Low
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
* A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we’ll go far!
---
* Consumables. We’re not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefis/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
* English – or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
* Looting rules: We're planning to use a **DKP** system with **blind bidding** in order to avoid bid wars. **Loot Council** will be employed for **legendary items**. We believe this represents the fairest compromise between the needs of the guild and the needs of its members.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We’re currently planning to have at least three weekly raids. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there’s only MC/Ony and people don’t have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we're currently planning to have a Friday raid at 8-11 PM ST (or 8:30-11:30, depending on availability), and a Saturday and Sunday afternoon raid (5-8 PM ST). Other days and options might be explored depending on current progression.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to pop by on the discord server. When joining you’ll have a temporary rank and only see a public chat to counter any potential shenanigans.
---
Discord: discord.gg/mucN4Du
---
I honestly dont remember. I know one of them named their new character kut but I don't think either of those dudes made it to 60 on the new server. I also don't think that was the one who knew you. 
---
My memory is pretty shit and it's been a long time so I don't remember a lot of the details, but I played a 60 night elf hunter named celoring for awhile, I didn't actually even level it and I have no idea who even owned it. I did pvp a lot though and I'd run around with infamous a bit. I remember takuu and shangsrogue and you and bluelazer or something like that from horde. Aside from that I only really remember a few of the more prominent alliance in infamous (swifty chipman howitzer) and that's about it. Most of it is just a blur. 
---
I was also in merciless midgets for a bit while leveling but no one from there sticks out.
---
All you need is xpearl unit frames and all possible icons on your screen
---
When LFG came out it also gave you an insane boost to damage heath and healing just for having pugs in your group. LFG in wrath was not just a simple group finder like you pointed out. It carved out the world and replaced it with instant gratification teleports.
---
Where are Recount and Skada that streamers use right now?
---
Pretty much this. 
---
Asmon has like 25-30k viewers average and some 70k+ since the classic beta, he isn't hiding anything.  People will find what server he's on within the first couple hours no doubt even if he doesn't stream it.
---
I imagine he won't be worried too much about being secret. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if he says what server he plans to play on just so that no one gets screwed over by accidentally joining his server. He knows his viewers who want to play on his server will end up there anyhow.
---
This is a major reason I don't like pet classes in RPG's. There's always some bug or issue with pets. Hope this one gets fixed for you.
---
they said theyre going to release phases based on how quickly players are getting through content. within reason ofc, because they want time for everyone to experience thigns and gear up a bit
---
Towelliee is such a bad ass lol, he almost wiped Asmongold 40 man raid while they were retreating by attacking the rare elite mob that walked pass by them. That guy should just stick to his mount farming and vaping
---
I remember that chinese gold bots used to farm DM tribute with hunters even back then, but it might have been during TBC possibly.
---
Die and run to another spirit healer, that's the easiest way and you benefit from the NE wisp passive.
---
Every server will have streamers. Hopefully the big name large following streamers do all play on one server or else I do see things going their way every time.
---
Just for fun I tried the Beta on my backup rig, which is an i5 4690k and a gtx 970.  I was getting 200 fps at max settings.  I know a 4690k isn't bad by any means, but gone are the days where it was top dog.  I don't think you'll have to spend very much to get a rig that runs the Classic client with high settings and smooth framerates.  It was super impressed by the performance of the beta
---
Literally the worse, can't even compete with balance drood
---
Yea you'll have to re-sac. It's an absolute best raid spec as long as there's one other lock with imp, simply cuz 15&gt;10.
---
I would say cosmetics are fine. Once you have achieved something, like bought your first epic mount with gold that you farmed, go ahead and get a new skin for it with real money. (Not in Classic, though; you can fuck right off with that.)
---
It is for sure. The downside though is that an 'endgame' like this is tremendously more finite than an instance based endgame.
---
This is kinda cool right now because its new and wasn't super expected, so there is still a little room for creativity. However at the end of the day its the same as instance based - eventually, you'll get all that best gear. And it will take a lot less time to do so because you aren't competing for that loot against 39 other people.
---
It can't hurt to ask a quick question in general chat. You won't get memed all the time
---
Classic wow is still using the modern engine. I would ensure that you can run retail World of Warcraft if you intend on playing Classic. You will also need a subscription for retail in order to play Classic. 
---
Given that you are going to multibox and run at 1080p you will probably want to get as close to this as you can:
---
* Recommended Specifications
---
* Operating System - Windows® 10 64-bit
---
* Processor - Intel® Core™ i7-4770 or AMD FX™-8310 or better
---
* Video - NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 960 4GB or AMD™ Radeon™ R9 280 or better
---
* Memory - 8 GB RAM

* Storage - 70GB available space SSD
---
* Internet - Broadband internet connection

Something like this should suffice just fine:  [https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-nitro-5-15-6-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1050-256gb-solid-state-drive-black/6302395.p?skuId=6302395](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-nitro-5-15-6-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1050-256gb-solid-state-drive-black/6302395.p?skuId=6302395)
---
encounters/bosses can be tricky for some players.
---
I just mean his YouTube content is reasonably well made. He did a decent job editing and presenting. I liked some of his interviews with more knowledgeable players. It helped me discover those people's channels so I could follow them. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to dislike. Mostly just saying there are some positives on his YouTube presence compared to Twitch.
---
You still get SS vs TM big battles on PvE servers.
---
same, but thats because i didnt start until Wrath :(
---
I watched the whole thing last night from Azmo’s perspective and some from Venruki’s, Azmongold was gutted. I hope we see more of these faction wars. Azmongold had roughly 65-75k viewers and Venruki had 11k. I’m not sure about the others, (Tipsout, Esfand, Sony, etc..) but the overall stream count for the WOW channel since beta release has been great on twitch, regularly coming in at around 135k! Never see those kinda numbers for WoW unless it’s an expansion or patch announcement.
---
My bad friend!!
---
no.  on launch u'd be way better off in the tree.  not nearly as many nightelves as humans gonna be overcrowding the starter zone
---
after launch just get a summon.
---
He means the character model
---
Won’t be that hard, it’s just going to take a while
---
Fury is the highest DPS outside of a mage with the rolling ignite.
---
Make the run through wetlands, you will die A LOT, so it will take time, other than that there’s nothing stopping you. 
---
Just make sure to take all the flight-points along the way.
---
Looks like I might've been wrong. Sorry.
---
Running to storm wind isn’t as bad as it sounds though, it’s much more viable than other zone swaps you can do(like warlock/mage in teldtassil)
---
Gross.
---
This is not testing of a new game though, but rather testing of a *recreation* of an *old* game. If they truly were motivated to have the most "variety", then why not open it up to D3 and SC players as well? BFA is closer to D3 after all game-wise (albeit not a persistent world)
---
New playable race for classic confirmed
---
I like it personally. 
---
The old system was there for almost the entirety of vanilla WoW and it makes more sense from an RPG perspective.
---
However, I am kind of bummed out that their current plan is to not implement the unarmoured epic mounts again though.
---
What is Wow Classic? Azeroth as it was. If you change it, is it Azeroth as it was? If it isnt Azeroth as it was, is it WoW Classic? And what is WoW Classic? WoW Classic is Azeroth as it was.
---
It's the most humiliating for the target. The aim is to keep him completely unable to do anything at all for maximum luls.
---
No the honnor system is P2 and BG’s are P3
---
You likely don't have beta access (not a lot of people do) which is fine. That drop down box will appear on its own when another "account" for World of Warcraft is active. When Classic is released it should appear for you. :)
---
Orgrimmar music plays in random zones that are not Org. I've seen (heard) it played in Loch Modan and dungeons as well on stream. Apparently someone heard IF music being played in SM as well, but I don't play enough Alliance to know if that's IF music or not. It bugs the crap out of me lol.
---
Yes it is possible, you will have to spirit Rez which makes it easier.........I did it last night. STAY ON THE ROADS!
---
From starting zone run to darn
---
From darn take port to hippo
---
Hippo to Darkshore
---
Take boat from Darkshore to wetlands 
---
Run halfway in wetlands
---
STAY ON ROADS AVOID MONSTERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
---
Try and die in the middle of wetlands
---
Die as far as possible and get sent to Dun Morogh GY
---
Spirit Rez in Dun Morogh and run to IF
---
Take IF tram to SW
---
U are home :)
---
I think MTX does more harm to a game like WoW than the philosophy of it, I think it harms player retention dramatically. If Classic WoW is going to be known for anything, it's probably going to be the grind. The time spent leveling, getting attuned, getting geared, leveling professions, forming a guild, forming a raid, running a 40 man raid over and over and over again, just so everyone is geared enough to run the next raid which requires more attunements, more grinding, etc. That's months of work for 40 people. Across hundreds of guilds. And that's just the raid content. There's no easy way through, you can't pay your way to the end. And every month you spend toiling, you're paying your subscription. And you're enjoying it, for a long, long time.
---
Me too i always try to thank the guy, either with a whisper pr an emote :) its funny that a single buff in vanilla can cause more social interaction than whole bfa (I am comparing purely from social interaction point of view)
---
Rating? Gear? Those are the things that ruined the game.. I was there when it happened.. But as i said, this “lfg” tool is not just a lfg now.. it ranks people, so if you dont have a good gear, you have much much lesser chance of getting better gear because some addon tells people that you are unworthy to be invited to their group. If this actually happens, its so sad.. I wish people could realize that this game is much more than just numbers, rankings, gear...
---
&gt; Sylvanas being a Night Elf was hella awkward
---
When did that change? I joined about a year into TBC and AFAIK her model was already different by then.
---
I'd like to see Luna come to Classic.
---
This is why you could make the argument that streamers should be "assigned" a realm to play on by Blizzard... if they keep horde/alliance balanced with streamers, it can actually be kind of fun. Especially if the streamers are actually decent at the game, good leaders, and not whiny entitled brats (and not all of them are).
---
That was a fun watch!
---
Used to main a Hunter in 2005/06, tried retail on a warlock and noticed the same thing - annoying as hell
---
Thumbs up for raising awareness, please Blizzard fix it
---
Absolutely, I'm guessing this is just a wrapper for a server-wide LFG channel that will remove 90% of the LFG chat in trade that you see on private servers.
---
He ran out of people willing to help, got curbstomped one last time and flew back to Ironforge without his axe.
---
This is awesome man! I remember seeing you while watching from a lot of streamers POVs who was the warrior you were helping? Just curious.
---
This does not work. You port back to the one you started at.
---
This is sad because legion was good. Nightborne questline was great, Khadgar was great, And it has my favorite quest line, Runnas the Shamed.
---
As a Horde player, yes. Always.
---
I have it on my 60 Troll Rogue from our 3rd or 4th BWL clear back in the day.
---
classic with questhelper omegalul
---
Thank you ver much!
---
Yes I agree downing Ragnaros was great but overall I think AQ40 was kinda my pve pinnacle as we progressed slowly but surely all the way to Cthun! We even tried to pull of wlock tanking in Twin emps but gave up on that eventually and got through with warrior tanking =) Still kinda pissed we never got to down Viscidus tho.. for some reason my guild back in the day was not that interested taking him down as he was optional but ye..
---
I remember that people learned to ignore them, summoning was often seen as a waste and once summoned you could navigate around them.  I don't recall when they started bugging out 99% of the time, but even before that their AI was dubious at best and they mostly just existed to slightly push a turtle one way.
---
“When Classic is released it should appear for you. :)”
---
Damn I’m hyped...just reading that made me slightly giddy
---
Why is it so egregious to just ask blizzard to check? Why is it that people such as yourself are so hellbent on making it so any kind of question of the values gets shot down?
---
Let Blizzard decide what they want to do and let them check, because ultimately you have as much information as the rest of us.
---
It’s not about difficulty even, it’s about accuracy.
---
You are most welcome. Best of luck to you getting into the beta (Sign up on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) and make sure you have an active WoW sub) this way you can test things out (if you get in!) before it goes live!
---
Post on the official EU forum. I'm sure they will hear us. :-)
---
&gt;Yes because they want to reward the players who stuck with the game and continued supporting it.
---
Because getting unrestricted access to an entire second game at no additional cost was not "reward" enough?
---
Also just FYI people have reported not actually needing to be subbed to get their invite but they did need to sub before they could start playing it. Anecdotal still but that's what I've seen people saying.
---
I looked at it further and it does look like he just straight up forked the BfA addon without making any changes. It matches the [source](https://bitbucket.org/ejsvifq_mabmip/lookingforgroup/src/default/).
---
 I guess you were right.
---
&lt;No Plan Required&gt; is an EU Alliance guild that intends to roll on a PvP server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
What to expect
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. This means that all members who wish to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared and according to the schedule. We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week, and additional nights may come into play after launch. Unorthodox specs such are allowed, but are expected to work as hard as they can to retain the respective balance of participation in our raiding core.
---
We often hang out and socialise while we wait for classic launch. Additionally, we host our own vanilla server for us to jump on, test some things and have some fun every now and then.
---
We are currently accepting raid leader applications!
---
Raid dates: Thursday &amp; Tuesday
---
Raid times: 7:50 PM GMT
---
Join our discord server! https://discord.gg/2C6gJZw
---
I understood that too, but my guess is that it's not that important in live for it to be fixed. The game is so much different that this little delay doesn't have as big an impact (except quality of life probably) than on vanilla. I hope it goes up in priority among all the bugs they have to fix, because it really is a big issue for classic at least.
---
Zero streamers in EU PvE servers.
---
You are most welcome. Best of luck getting into beta (if you're signed up!)
---
I love arena.  It's literally the only thing that's made me try every expansion (I usually play 1-2 seasons, get gladiator a few times and then quit).  For me, it's the best part of the game.  BUT, its the best part of RETAIL.  I'm super super excited to get back to WPVP/BG PvP in classic.    
---
As someone with way less time now I'm excited for the long journey and back to more 'casual' pvp. I really hope that WPVP &amp; BG fully scratch my PvP itch but I think it will.
---
&gt;  bc of tournaments
---
MOAR MONEY :)
---
It's fine, it will just be a LFG channel with a nice wrapper so you can list yourself as available for a dungeon. You'll still have to make a group and travel to the instance. Beats reading through page after page of LF1M spam in the trade channel or losing out on an evening of gaming because you're stuck in Stormwind spamming trade channel for an SM run.
---
I'll probably sub for a few months and then stop if I don't like it.
---
Wow so many unnecessary downvotes even though you clearly sparked a decent conversation.
---
So I'm getting a Dell Alienware m15 with a RTX 2060 graphics card. I have an older gaming tower that I built quite a few years ago but it needs upgrades. I want the laptop mainly for portability so I can play on the couch and in my home office. 
---
I have a lap-top-table that I already use when I'm on the couch for my work laptop. This gives me enough room for the laptop and a mouse so I'll be able to grind and farm comfortably from the couch. 
---
I will also use the laptop for non-gaming projects too. The gaming laptop will be fine for me and worst case scenario I just upgrade my old gaming tower!
---
everyone is going to want to stream classic, so yeah every server will have streamers on in. but theres a HUGE difference between playing on a server with someone like soda or asmon, or some random guy who has 3 viewers. im kinda surprised with asmons response to that considering hes usually one to think things through pretty well.
---
X perl is available but not used on p servers...
---
Luna universally used
---
No I don't just need x perl from waht I've seen of the options. LUNA is superior
---
Hi, /u/Zeiramrei
---
It's not really to be the first 60 it's more to be ahead of the pack so we don't have to fight for every mob and every quest
---
I don't want to diminish your optimism, but continuing classic with the original expansion packs would be a huge mistake. This would continually and inevitably lead to the garbage that WoW is today or an endless loop of predictable progression that people would get bored of. 
---
That's not to say I wouldn't appreciate a further development of content, but with WoW Classic, Blizzard has a second chance to not repeat their mistakes and I really hope they will stick to the mindset that makes WoW Classic what it is. WoTLK in particular was imo the begining of WoW's downfall (faceroll heroics, lfd, only one relevant raiding tier). 
---
Although all the expansions I've played also had some cool content to them, they would have to completely restructure and tune them to make them fit more seamlessly and stay in line with the spirit of Classic.
---
They could certainly do a prequel - something in the time of the War of the Ancients or something.
---
People watch dudes run around a field kicking a ball
---
Here's a [clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/DeliciousClearDumplingsPeoplesChamp) of it, basically every streamer currently above level 20 went there.
---
You might be better off having 2 warriors
---
You're not going to suck, usually a boss has 0-1 mechanic you want to be aware of, and if your RL can't call them it's not your problem.
---
What classes/specs are you guys in most need of? Also any idea what two nights/ time you're planning on potentially going?
---
Eventually every single server is going to have a successful streamer or two. Esfand and Asmon style successful? Maybe not, but we’re in the age of streaming now, low view streamers will hop onto a server without any major streamers and become popular in a small scale way, if they’re any good, and enough of them will be.
---
This. Can't imagine the discipline needed and all the pain endured pulling this off.. respect.
---
Didn’t he say something like “the plan was to aggro it then lead it to the horde and then die thus it would attack them”... The logic on that play was 10/10 brilliant. /s 
---
Pretty sure he did it just to troll asmongold. He even had that little shit eating grin after he did it. Dude seems pretty jealous of the fame asmon has based on the stalking he does on his subreddit.
---
&gt; The original developer of Dark Age of Camelot is currently working on a new classic-style MMORPG
---
I'm so skeptical about Camelot Unchained being good it's not funny. The subreddit and forums are both just echo-chambers.
---
This, it should be pretty quick to get level 10, idk about warrior quests but hunters have to do the pet quest line at 10 so it's probably best to level to 10 and then meet up
---
To remember the good ol' days ofc!
---
I remember reading through some forums and even on reddit back when the legendary cloak in MoP required you to  win 2 battlegrounds. People were complaining as if that was the worst time of their life and they never ever wanted to step back into a BG again.
---
I despise PvE to the point where I absolutely loathe it. I struggle to find any of it fun, but throughout the several xpacks this far, I've always been forced to farm trinkets, weapons and occasionally gear that gave you an immense advantage in PvP. I think that's fair, the game isn't suppose to be a cookbook recipe and you should experience the world, nothing is forcing you.
---
They can see your activity in game, so if you don't log into BfA and stay inactive, they'll most likely freeze your sub if you ask, or give you sub time back if you ask later. Done it a few times i've miscalculated my subs
---
Not directly topic related but are there any announcements how many servers will go live?
---
depends on what class you're playing and what content you're doing. you might play affliction in pve or 5-mans which has a slightly more complicated job juggling dots
---
a lot of stuff in 40-mans was optimized around using the minimum possible debuff slots to avoid losing the ones that mattered, and that's not really indicative of the rest of the game tbh
---
Blizzard puts virtually no time into bug-fixing on retail.
---
They did specifically mention that if 2 players got on a blimp/ship from Kalimdor to Eastern Kingdoms, they would arrive in the same Layer.
---
While the layers might technically be continent wide, this comment would imply that there is some connection between each EK and K layer.
---
As I mentioned in a previous comment. We don't know enough details about layers yet.
---
I only caught up with it when they were about to find Asmon for the first time. Ended up watching all the way to the GoT release, had a blast.
---
Brian looks and seems incredibly genuine and nice from interviews
---
Overwatch is a dead game that Blizzard tries his hardest to "keep relevant". It was supposed to be their big "Esports" title and it fell flat as fuck. No one care about this trash game and I'm so happy about it.
---
That was my first though on hearing that BFA was going to be all about the feel of the Alliance and Horde at war.
---
Uh yeah, that's how it felt in 2004 my dudes and you didn't need fancy mechanics. Just a big old sandpit where we could twat each other with sticks.
---
You won't be able to learn Nelf-specific spells without travelling back to Darnassus so it should be fine unless you plan on playing a druid or priest.
---
I think I'll make the time up by copying Asmongolds route. He will have done it twice by then and knows what he's doing. I just hope a druid playing solo can do all the things he will be doing, duo leveling as warrior/paladin
---
My wife was surprised when I took 3 days off for release even though shes played WoW to lvl 85.  But lucky for me shes starting her masters program in the summer so I'll have lots of alone time for the next year.  
---
I'm sure i'll get her to level an alt with me too once her program is done :)
---
You can re-set by logging out and closing the game. Then you can be respawned at any spirit healer. Not sure if it will work that way with the new client though.
---
If speed matters then no it's not viable, losing valuable levling time plus the human zones will be way more populated than Teldrassil.
---
personally i think itd be cool if they added a homage to nostalrius in classic somewhere. nothing big, but maybe just some small carving on some random rock out in the middle of nowhere.
---
Theres something about a ghost that spawns ghosts 2 i think? They might be elite as well, but could be normal. Ah gosh i cant wait to run that place again now.
---
This this this, thousand times this, I could bare automatic lfg but sharing is such a crap that I can’t even...
---
No Legion does not. WoD tried to do alternate universes but dropped the ball and legion was like “Thanks for resurrecting Guldan!” And then made an expansion where we are invaded by alien demons and then in retribution to invade Argus.
---
I did the same thing on the weekend. So far no beta invite :P
---
Read the description on the github page, 100% troll.
---
i could see that
---
i was go8ng to say what would they do after the prequel
---
but if they planned out the first 5 or so expansions and made sure the whole story fit it could work well
---
This is a weak semantic argument and nothing more. Semantic arguments are the worst kind of arguments.
---
**GUILD NAME** : BEACH BOYS

Also here: [https://discord.gg/mtYfJkT](https://discord.gg/mtYfJkT)
---
It's easy for them to, but perhaps Blizzard has asked them directly not to do that.
---
I have extreme appreciation for you comprehension.
---
But in videogames that if referred to as AI. It includes pathing and behavior.
---
Mouseover macros oficially started in TBC (the adding of "target=mouseover" on macros) but it was possible in vanilla using the "super macro" addon od w/e it's called.
---
Vanilla basically allowed everything with enough study lol, the macro system even allowed some bot-ish interactions like automatically choosing the best target for your heal/dispell etc
---
Just my opinion, but it sucks pretty bad TBH.  Depends how much time you want to spend farming gold vs actually playing in a way you want to play.
---
This idea is a big part of the reason I’m leaning towards playing a HotW spec’d Druid knowing it’s not completely optimal for anything specifically, but absolutely viable for PvE healing, dungeon tanking, and PvP. 
---
My inner min/maxer and desire to roll a rogue or warrior and top damage meters is fighting this idea tho...
---
You said this with tongue in cheek, right?
---
Just walk jump is all
---
I would love if someone with the beta would test this. I would for sure use it.
---
I play a carrier in Star Trek Online and pets have been bugged all to fuck in that game for years. I feel your pain.
---
PvP is essentially dead in modern WoW. Yeah there are people queuing up for BGs and still a small Arena scene, but it really is not even on the radar of so many players. I guarantee you, if Warfronts were PvP focused, there would have been an outcry because so many people can’t stand PvPing now.
---
I loved PvP in Vanilla, TBC and Wrath, but I haven’t touched it since Cataclysm.
---
Uh any class with armor higher than light armor can tank RFC.  And any class with a shield can tank dungeons until about SM.
---
Plenty of Paladins (Deadmines) and Shaman (WC) can tank as well during that time where you have no real tanking talents.
---
Why? If you don't want to you don't have to watch it.  
---
People do whatever they want with their money.   
---
I don't understand why they do it but they have  the right to donate to streamers.  
---
If that makes you angry you're problem is that you envy the streamer and his success.
---
&gt; The only thing it has the potential to skip is having to message people in major cities to ask if they are interested in joining your group.
---
Its basically a way to get World and Global of private servers, I'm not even mad. The worst part of LFG was as you said, instant teleportation and cross realm.
---
just sitting here reminding myself that the wait will make it sweeter
---
&gt; What part of anything that I just said advocates for a massive change in class mechanics? People do this shit every time they are presented with an argument that they can't refute.
---
because your arguing to arbitrarily balance around ONE piece of the game that you participate in 3-5 hours a week on average for no reason other than "its a raid" and refuse to acknowledge EVERY spec in the game is played for something its very good at.
---
does soul link need to grant more warlock damage beause it cant raid too? what about arm? of course not. the ONLY balance change i think has merit is buffing resto druids or giving them a res, but even that is a big nerf to ret paladins and dps shamans.
---
also feral druids get used all the time, from casual guilds to the literal fastest naxx clearing guild on private servers.
---
thank god people like you dont get your way for classic because wed have a cesspool of imbalanced shit with the goal being for BFA where every spec is the same strength at everything because you dont want to respec to raid or dont enjoy playing the CLASS you picked instead of 1 of the 3 specs
---
They are offering same shit that music offers that someone listens while playing or exercising, tv show that plays in the background while someone cooks, etc. If a game is not super good (and last super good game I've played was God of War) - I always turn on a random stream to watch on second monitor while playing.
---
I've been ganked plenty of times. I've never had a group of people kill me over and over again. It might happen to some people, but it is extremely rare
---
I don't know any 'big' german streamer (wow) with more than 1000 viewers and I'm sure there will be EU-German servers.
---
The same way everyone hates EA yet they still make billions.
---
There’s a lot of idiots in the world.
---
I got 7 days free playing time as well. I like Blizzard now again haha!
---
Will add another 30 days subscription and hope that I get an invite...
---
But how awesome is that I am just logging in with my 15 years old characters level 60 :D
---
I guess the only complaint people will have now is that dungeon gear will be easier to get using this method, you can quest while getting a group.
---
You can do that on most private servers with global and world
---
Too bad I gave my account to a friend tge first time i quit wow at the end of TBC
---
I'm currently playing on the account I bought when I started playing again when wrath launched.
---
i cant seem to recall many guns, but the bow from MC - the skull one, that is solid and believable.
---
It's not unless your playing endgame with no problem, its a major cash drain to respec and will need a lot of time/money.
---
thanks, looks like random world pvp will be more common than on other expansions.
---
Are there any raids that require you to control the territory to enter?
---
tauren can't ride the normal orgrimmar wolves. you need to grind av rep.
---
Yeah that´s what holding me back. I won't sub for the possibility of getting an beta invite. If it was guaranteed that whould be another story
---
GTX 5XX will scream in the current client that is not supported (but still "runs") plus it's a super bad card nowadays.
---
Basic PC could just use AMD Ryzen 3/5 APU, or second hand RX 470/480 570/580 which now are super cheap. As a laptop you would have to look for something with GTX 1050 Ti/1060 or as in other comment listed GTX 1050 will suffice too.
---
nope.
---
Why wouldn't it be 'viable' ?  Just follow the road and dodge any mobs that cross
---
100% just roll a second copy of the same class. You only have to put the leveling time in again once, wheras you will be farming that gold forever. Can you imagine your friends invite you to a premade BG so you respec but then it falls apart early or something and you have to raid tomorrow? You just wasted 100g.
---
You COULD be so rich that the gold is always flowing and you can literally respec whenever you want. But you probably won't be.
---
Classic WOW soon baby gril
---
DMN tribute runs weren't possible due to bad AI, it was because a hunter using cheetah aspect runs faster than Gor'dok. If he takes any other path than exactly what you are going for it's because the hunter ran too far and the boss fell too far behind. You keep the boss at 15-25y range, if it goes above about 25 you stop and let him catch up.
---
There are still DMN tribute run videos from original Vanilla on youtube to confirm this, he didn't miss any quicker paths. Even if he did all the hunter would have to do was run longer in between autos and take longer to kill him. If he falls too far back you will miss out on some damage due too not being able to stop for autoshots, if he gets too close he hits like a truck, dazes you since you have cheetah active and kills you in 2-3 fast hits.
---
&gt; refuse to call them content creators lol
---
influencers lol
---
Damn... been leaning towards rolling a Druid for the versatility in world PvP (and PvE with a HotW spec), and this is certainly reinforcing it!
---
Yep. There are a ton of references to really cool wars, conflicts, and stories in the game and in the WC RTS games that I'd love to see in a MMO setting.
---
&gt;You're going to have to go to Stormwind everytime you want to level new skills.
---
Well or IF or Darn.  One nice thing will be SW not being the center of the universe
---
That's a rookie talking. The most humiliating is loosing to a naked guy with a level 1 dagger - to which you need to spend combo points on Eviscerate.
---
DOMINOS!
---
It was an epic battle between the alliance and horde. Solid PvP. PvE that summoned cool faction bosses. And it t felt like a genuine war!
---
Yep, that small window of time between the honor system and BG's was the best period in WoW.
---
Not trolling, just never played vanilla before and want some info before committing.
---
And I wish that we will see all the feadback recognized in the upcoming expansion reveal at Blizzcon this year 😊 honestly, they'd be dumb if not to listen to the audience this time.
---
And I really think this might be the main reason for them to not attend GamesCon this year. They just haven't decided yet what the gameplay choices will be.
---
Absolutely. You dont even need to be resto spec for dungeons, all you need is a healing set.
---
This is a really dumb post.
---
It's trivial.
---
"just disable them if you dont want to see them" do you think this is a single player game? i know bfa feels pretty similar to a single player, but thats not how the game used to be
---
Care to do some math to back up that statement?
---
The people asking for this stuff are just more meta than you are.  They were asking for it back then, too.
---
You clearly missed island expiditions.
---
the kids calves
---
Assuming you can still go under orgrimmar as well then?
---
Im actually planning to roll on a streamer server, maybe not with to big streamers but tbh the rivalry that has already started on the beta plus knowing the faces of some players already, makes it seem like alot of fun. I dont really mind overpopulation.
---
Because most people are bad
---
I understand how it works, I used a similar addon on private servers, I still think it goes against the pillars of classic. Regardless, they said they wouldn't allow it so nothing to worry about.
---
Maybe this will help.
---
[https://imgur.com/v3vvmbJ](https://imgur.com/v3vvmbJ)
---
I played old AV. It was fun the first 2 or 3 times. After that it was just a huge drag. I'd rather have large scale open world battles.
---
T2 judgement helm from ony.
---
eh, maybe, we'll have to see once this type of thing comes up on the beta. personally i'd prefer it wasn't so strong, as it pigeonholes dps classes into orc/human for some, but there was some news where they were confirming that they know/knew weapon skill was overpowered.
---
A guild only need like 50 players to dominate, a streamer with a few hundred could surely change things. You don't need 50k.
---
And also once the 50 viewer streamer on your "no-streamer server" is known its suddenly a streamer server.
---
I played on a pserver that was rejuvenated by a 200 viewer musical streamer with a love for classic wow and it was great.
---
doing the full tier 0 to tier 0.5 upgrade chain with 4 friends, including the strat baron 30min run.
---
being one of the on my server to step foot in naxx, didnt raid it as my guild had only just started BWL when TBC hit but i got myself attuned without help and went in there to see what all the noise was about.
---
being in my guilds first raggy kill, even if it was that early on in the game it was an achievement for me as this was something epic i was doing with a group of people i played the game a lot with
---
yeah ive been pretty critical of overwatch i will say it does show they can still design interesting characters
---
i prob would have loved some destiny style overwatch game w8th lots of story and cutscenes 
---
this is the first time ive launched the blizz launcher since i was disapo8nted by destiny's season pass just to sub to a game i dont play in the hope i get to test a game i want to play lol so its pretty much business as usual
---
well not slam spec :D
---
but yeah, horde warrior use 2H quite long.
---
All these people are saying that Asmon and esfand vs arena legends like Venruki and Sony Digital
---
Monkeynews was on the side of the alliance for that fight and got wrecked as well. 
---
I think horde had more numbers, but that's tough to say, both raids had at least 2 groups. I think the Alliance's group wasn't filled and I don't know how many horde groups were running. 
---
But let's be honest. It was a blast to watch. A flank tactic with mages doing novas just won the day. I don't think it would matter if it was Asmon, or someone else leading that raid.
---
Classic is going to be a blast!
---
I mean, if you want to play a DPS shaman, you are just going to need to find a guild that will let you give it a whirl, and do the best you can. You can definitely give this a try.
---
Biggest flaw I see in it is that it seems to rely on a fair amount of casting lightning bolts in melee range. Melee classes don't cast spells for a reason - they need to be mobile to deal with their mechanics. Even if this spec does do competitive DPS in a vacuum, in a raid environment it won't because whenever you need to move around you'll lose way more than anyone else standing around in melee range.
---
But at the end of the day, if you can find a guild that will let you play it, then you can play it, and thats about all that matters. Raiding through BWL is more about whether or not your guild has 40 people who can show up and implement a strategy with moderate success than about cutting edge DPS and gear.
---
Do you ever get tired of being wrong?
---
And? People used to form groups outside the game all the time.
---
You can be sure that eventually UI addons will be ported tp Classic - most likely including ElvUI. I guess at least 2 will be available before launch.
---
That is saying Blizzard asked Twitch to deliver a worse service to their customers. Honestly I don't think it is warranted yet. Autochess gave a huge boost to Dota2  and it was important to distinguish a mod from the actual game, while beta participants are rather few. It would be nice to just filter out classic though as I'm not interested in the retail version.
---
the "its only nostalgia" argument has always been a shitty argument. if it was only nostalgia people wouldnt have been playing vanilla for almost 15 years, it would have died off long ago.
---
&gt;bad effects they have on servers
---
care to elaborate?
---
Where did Blizzard say they wouldn't allow channel wrappers? I can't see how they could block them.
---
 **&lt;Relapse&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild, specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Our Official Raid Times are as follows:
---
**Tuesday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
**Thursday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
There is a chance we do cleanup on the weekends and possibly 20 mans, but that is up in the air and dependent on if people want to/are available.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
We will use EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
Pretty sure some real skilled people would be able to do the content without those infos and just react/mentally time it.
---
People have different tastes.
---
You enjoy baseball for example. Other people enjoy watching entertainers on twitch, interacting with them and watching what they play on live.
---
It's not just the game, it's the personality of the streamer themselves.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM)
---
Two quick ones that I have observed watchin beta streams:
---
1. The flight path between Stormwind and Ironforge is wrong. In the beta it takes you via the east side of Blackrock Mountain, wheres in Vanilla it would go via the west side over the Altar of Storms(?).
---
2. When you take a flight path the 'bird' stays horizontal the whole time, even when traversing mountains (like between Menethil Harbour and Ironforge). In vanilla the 'bird' would pitch up and down (along with camera) depending on the terrain.
---
I'm still debating if I should resub to get a chance at getting in the beta. But I'd be mad to do it and not get selected and lose 15/30 bucks for "nothing".  
---
And the fact that there's gonna be a reset when Classic hits live anyway.  
---
Also, I'm not sure which class I'll play. Rogue War or Mage, too hard to decide.
---
Oh I remember that run. Lol. Too fun. 😁
---
For what its worth, the main common denominators I've seen of people who have received beta invites so far are 1. account aged from Classic time period OR 2. big time streamer
---
I'd imagine that as more beta waves go out some of the things you did will become triggers but in the short term, evidence seems to suggest account age or prominence are the two most important factors right now.
---
I remember seeing a small part of an Asmongold video. He was really confused as to why he couldn't use the Meeting Stone outside of a dungeon to summon some party members. Though, I have to admit it took me some time to remember how it worked before TBC, too.
---
If the guy gets 10k viewers, it's obvious that a lot of people don't care about whatever minor trivial details he might have missed over the course of a 12-hour gaming session.
---
Good topic, i was thinking the same mate. Curious if someone has a good explanation. Thanks!
---
You gain the same xp for killing mobs in a 2 man group, it's just shared between both of you.
---
&gt;The faster spell batching means that the game is sending and receiving information to/from the server way more often.
---
The server still has to do the same total number of calculations over any given timeframe tho right?
---
considering bfa has only 1-2 million subs (based off of fairly accurate estimates and leaks) its pretty safe to say that classic has a good chance to blow that sub count out of the water. classic could possibly even post record numbers for blizzard again but personally i think itll be around 5-7 million subs
---
yeah WoD , i never really followed the story but i completely checked out then
---
or maybe mop the whole pamda thing made me pretty salty though i did all those raids and had a bit of fun
---
So in a group of 2, we kill a boar that gives 10pexp, we both get 50?
---
Starting without, might add some later down the line. I will just skip addons like DBM and such though because you honestly do not need DBM in Classic.
---
Will save some memory.
---
Another problem with a lot of these meme builds are debuff slots. You just can't throw half a dozen multidot classes in the mix without them being unable to do anything but press their main nuke, which will end up being less efficient than just having another mage or two. Even run of the mill non-tryhard guilds will have to limit this sort of thing to get anything done.
---
It's a bummer for those moonkin lifers but there's a reason these specs don't fit in.
---
Very interested in seeing the results of this, especially with all the rumours regarding the invites.
---
I will imagine a huge amount of "no invites" though since you added that option.
---
I dont think you understand the value of fear in Vanilla, you'll learn.
---
What are warfronts if you don't mind explaining it to me.
---
Overpopulation will be the least of your problems.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM
---
Thank you for this!
---
I'm sure they've checked. Thing is, we can check this ourselves, and people have done that, and they've found that the damage is correct. This whining isn't even reporting bugs, it's just a stupid borderline conspiracy theory that people come up with to avoid having to face the reality that 1) their precious private servers were wrong, and 2) their precious memories suffered from the Mandela Effect.
---
Given the way Classic is implemented there is basically nothing that could even make mob damage incorrect. They straight up ported the 1.12 data. They didn't punch shit in by hand, it's the actual 1.12 database just straight ported over to the modern architecture.
---
After Blizzard gets around to updating the "Not A Bug List" saying that mob damage is working as intended, the next conspiracy theory will be that there was a collective nerf to mob damage that wasn't listed in any of the patch notes before 1.12. In fact, some people like TipsOut are already spouting this nonsense.
---
Just face reality, my man. The numbers are working as intended. Pre-30 dungeons were never hard. You're just misremembering.
---
the best way to handle that is to make new servers for TBC and allow people to copy their characters over to there, letting you play both vanilla AND TBC

  look at the VODs, the madman has streamed 58+ hours in the last 5 days
---
The will NEVER get rid of LFR. The Casual audience requires it.

Also Legion made perfect sense, the legion send their ships to Azeroth and try to invade again but this time it’s full scale and not incursions like previously. And while I don’t care for BFA much I still love the Zandalari and Vulpera NPCs I traveled with. Also Dolly and Dot. The only thing I’d want a rewind for is if Blizzard is like “Yeah having you resurrect Rastakhan and then killing him off as a raid boss was stupid, so go with talanji and recruit the past Rastakhan”. There’s actually an easy way in the story atm to shift to WoW 2. Have the old gods win. Get rid of the factions or don’t make them a part of player characters, since at this point the factions are on auto pilot and hurting the story, and have it be the factions of Azeroth have to rebel against the re-arisen black empire. Then they can have new factions that make sense start popping up during it and at the send have factions anyone can join like FF14. Like an Honorable Savage Faction, Undeath Faction, Elven Alliance .etc
---
It would also allow them to add fan favorite races that are a part of the horde and alliance and make them playable or atleast more noticeable like the Hozen and Sanlayn.
---
We're getting neutered AV so no
---
In Vanilla? Sure.
---
In all of WoW? Not even in the top 10.
---
Couldn’t you use addons or maybe it was ingame, to adjust the size to really big or really small name text?
---
**Purpose:**  Looking for Guild/Friends
---
**Region:**  NA (East Coast)
---
**Server Type:**  PVP
---
**Faction:**  I could go either way on the faction to be honest - I'm not locked into either one yet.
---
**Play times:**  Somewhere between 6pm - 12am EST during the week, and varies on the weekends.
---
**Play style:**  Definitely PVP/social... but I suspect I will probably have to raid some to be competitive in PVP.
---
**Rules:**  I'm a Christian and just looking for folks to play the game with that don't have a foul mouth. I'm not interested in vulgar conversations. =)  So, if you have a family-friendly, PG style guild I'd be more than happy to apply... or if you're just a straggler like myself looking for other laid back folks to play the game with then hit me up.  Thanks!!
---
**Contact Method:**  Reddit Private Message
---
Thanks!! =)
---
its also wrong ;)
---
To be fair, WoW was never intended to be a sandbox MMO like Ultima Online or Eve. It was always planned to be an EQ-style themepark (not in a derogatory sense). It makes sense that they tried to reign in the open-ended sandbox gameplay to focus on streamlining, story and PvE content - it's also much easier to work that type of content into yearly expansions.
---
If we ever get new things added I reckon a noticeboard should be one.
---
In classic you can sign up to do dungeons by going to the meeting stone. Why would an adventurer go to the place before looking for help? Makes no sense. Now if there was a noticeboard in the inns at Org and IF that worked in the same way it would be more practical, rather that never getting any use at all.
---
No, that looks to be John Yang in the front row.
---
I understand where you're coming from, but this honestly just feels like we have a very different idea of fun (and that's okay, that's why both types of server exist).
---
To me, the idea of only being able to PvP when the game puts you in a room with other players where you can safely and consenually PvP and no one's feelings get hurt just feels so....sterile?
---
I also get enjoyment from being on a PvP server even when no PvP is taking place. Keeping your head on a swivel while questing, trying to keep mental track of the last time you saw a high level run by and where they might have gone, doing the mental math to try and figure out if its safer to kill that hordie and piss him off, or let him be and potentially outnumber me when another horde shows up, all of that adds so much spice to the experience for me.
---
Sure you get oneshot by a random rogue now and again, and yea that can kinda suck. But personally I don't think its that big of a deal. I also think the frequency is heavily overestimated: every time you get ganked and it pisses you off, that memory sticks out way more than the 4 hours of peaceful questing you got earlier that day. I've been playing a long time, on a lot of servers, a lot of different retail versions, and I can honestly say the number of times I've had to literally leave the zone or log off because of ganks is *extremely* low. Like, can count on my fingers low.

you say that because you never watched him.

&gt;Also no quest items from pick pocketing.

Outside of the rogue poison quest. Or any other class quest I'm forgetting.
---
I like PvP. But I think WoW is a shit PvP game. wPvP is a little fun because it ties into the rest of the RPG fairly well. But I'm never going out of my way for PvP matches or whatever, I'd rather go play a different game that does a decent job at it than some botched attempt at making what is clearly a PvE game into PvP. 
---
&gt;I despise PvE to the point where I absolutely loathe it. 
---
So seeing this I'm surprised you're still interested in WoW at all. Different tastes I guess.
---
Simple fact that a fair number of your pre-raid BiS is going to be quest rewards.
---
Blizzcon 2018, classic wow panel, Ion has a power point presentation insuring us they knew what the point of the classic movement was and as such they would not allow addon functionality of this nature in classic.
---
the entire reason theyre making classic is for historical preservation of classic as it was back in 2006, so anyone can go back and see how the game used to be. you dont go to a museum and start adding stuff to paintings just because you think itll make it better, you just leave it as it is.
---
Sure doesn‘t hurt.
---
Dude YES hahahaha. Man I remember all those guys! That is so funny. You are bringing back so many memories. Yeah, Shangsrogue was actually my real life roommate at the time so we would roll around together everywhere since we could yell to each other during PVP. 
---
Albis was so good too and loved his pvp vids. I vaguely recall a night elf hunter name Celoring shooting me some in Warsong haha. :P
---
I played during nost and i was in the middle of the pack when i went to STV, its honestly not that bad. And we had 10k+ players. You get ganked sometimes, chase the gankers when you group q. But you are playing on a pvp server
---
Why not copy a route that works for nelfs instead of using Asmongolds?
---
https://twitter.com/_JohnYang/status/1027957968933773312
---
Well i'm gonna be playing Classic till my eyes bleed. Hopefully a couple years they will add TBC and Wrath and then if they do more act like this is Marvel and its a multiverse and change thing for the better Cata and beyond.
---
You would rather Herb/Alch and level BS once you hit the required rep for TB an then make the switch, you will most likely farm like 10k gold before you see all the mats for the hammer to complete it.
---
How is this different from creating a "private/public" chat where the entire faction (A/H) can talk instead of being constricted to LFG in cities?
---
When you find this in the inventory of your hunter....  [https://www.dropbox.com/s/cp7hpud5utuekrd/Screenshot%202019-05-20%2021.20.17.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cp7hpud5utuekrd/Screenshot%202019-05-20%2021.20.17.png?dl=0)
---
Yea without addons, these noobs can't keep up, some will manage to still suck somehow, hehe.
---
Me neither, but it was on the front page of this sub a day or two ago.
---
Don't be so stupid. Good luck with the petition (lol)
---
If you add any other piece of content on Classic, it will change the flow of players.
---
You see, people are more prone to do new content instead of old stuff. Groups looking for more players to do, let's say, Molten Core, will have a harder time if their pool of players is busy in Karazhan. You dilute the playerbase.
---
Messing with the avaliable pool of players is dangerous. Risky. A change in the *gameplay* of WoW Classic, which would go against it's pilosophy.
---
Anyone have a link to Asmongold's POV at the time of his death?
---
Atleast you are honest.
---
Relevance to the question of OP?
---
Yeah, I was worried about that, looks like I might have to do that.
---
I really dont think wpvp is going to be like this unless youre a streaner or in wpvp with a streamer
---
Meeting stones have a LFG function, they where just never used as it required traveling all the way to the dungeon first
---
Seems like you'll enjoy retail. You should try it.
---
You misunderstand. If you have no BG's, then the geared level 60 players' only way to farm honor is to kill every player 48+ on sight. That means that everything from Ungoro and up is effectively impossible to quest in.
---
I planned my weekends around it. You never knew if it was going to end, so you had to try and coordinate the team and get the useless lower levels to farm armor scraps. Literally nothing has replaced that longer PvP with RP aspects.
---
Just stop, you are the kind of person that forced blizzard to ruin the game
---
I've played through all xpacs, and wPvP never existed like in vanilla. If you never tried it this is honestly a big experience that I'd actually consider on same level as first time Arena was introduced or something like that. Sure, it is not a direct form of content made by Blizzard, but it is just such a special form of PvP that have not been present since TBC launched flying mounts (among many other changes that ruined wPvP).
---
There are no raids that directly require control of the territory, but it is common for people to "camp" entrances. Especially Blackrock Mountain, because it houses the entrances to Blackrock Depths (dungeon), Molten Core (first raid), Blackrock Spire (two dungeons) and Blackwing Lair (second raid). This means you have a giant bridge leading up to a volcano full of bridges inside and massive chains you can run on, cliffs to run on, different sized rooms and lava at the bottom. This is not only a incredibly cool place for PvP, but because of all the entrances it is a big gathering point for people. If you do PvE you need to go there regularly and if you are a PvP player this is a prime place to go find fights.
---
Another common way to find wPvP targets are by knowing the opposite factions flight routes. Know what place they have to fly to when they want to go to a raid. In the evening when people raid you then go to that place and when they travel from the flight point to the raid you jump them. Or you can go to your own flight point near the raid and find the opposite faction doing the same and try to defend your own faction members.
---
These are probably the main ways raids result in wPvP. Then there are gathering, devilsaur hunting and several other things that leads to people being out and about Azeroth, which of course means wPvP.
---
same i love SFK :D it's one of my favourites.  back in WoTLK i solo'd the last boss on a shaman alt for fun - it took quite a long time with lots of LoS'ing but i did it!  i think i was the same level as it but i dont remember
---
40v40 bgs work fine, so not sure how that is relevant.
---
Enhancement is not all that great in PvE content, and might be too random in PvP content. You're pretty much useless every time you do not get a Windfury crit.
---
Warrior is better overall in every type of content, but there are way better 2H weapons than Sulfuras for Warriors. Sulfuras is mainly a status and meme weapon.
---
You can start with any profession you want to start with. There are some tactics like starting with skinning as you level, to vendor all the leather you get to have a bigger income of gold—to later down the line get the profession you want at 60 and start farming them from there, much quicker and efficiently.
---
&gt; but Asmon definitely has charisma.
---
Really? I think along with resembling a severely autistic rodent he's got the like-ability of a cinderblock..
---
He will he playing a shit ton on releases. He said he’s got a spot in a serious raid guild
---
Thank you!
---
I know a GTX 580 is by far not up to date. But will it run 2x 1080p Classic wow?
---
Not generally used unless you're horde alliance 2 handed fury doesn't compete well aside from using bre on trash.
---
YouTuber makes a video about avoiding Twitch streamers.
---
There can't be more bias than that.
---
Maybe make your own opinion?
---
Sound like you are trying to convince yourself here. As some changes have been implemented already that debunks your theory 
---
Hope this helps.
---
so far all it is showing is bar 4 people no one has a beta invite, and its an even split over them 4
---
I specifically remember it staying up in Vanilla.
---
Unfortunately you'll be out of luck, then. AFAIK Blizzard doesn't offer any type of NA to EU character transferring service.
---
For what its worth, I've played WoW with a lot of guys stationed overseas who kept their character rolled on NA. I've seen entire guilds of people located in different countries / timezones dedicated to those particular raiding schedules. 
---
I'd say, pick whichever (NA or EU) you think its more likely that you'll long-term be spending the most time in, and roll on a server there. Hunt for a guild with similar time constraints to you. There are always people online from all over the world and with crazy work schedules.
---
my level 1-10 route, in a pair i end up level 8.5
---
you lose ALOT of xp in a pair, i prefer solo levelling if i dont need to group because no spawns etc.
---
See "How do I Play World of Warcraft Classic?"
---
Gotta be honest, this was pretty good
---
Define balance.
---
Good to know, thank you
---
To extend on my previous comment which was unclear, slam spec is indeed very good with a 3.8 weapon like zin'rokh. Without the right wep, horde should fish wf with hamstring into heroic strike instead
---
go play retail.
---
That is my own opinion. He brings up excellent arguments and I agree with all of them.
---
yeah, darkspear back then was super fun, I wish I would have spent more time on it because it really isn't even what I would consider my vanilla home
---
it would be amazing if classic could recreate the feeling of a server like that, lots of prolific people and really balanced overall
---
Neither you or the other clown seem to know what a database is.
---
&gt;I remember that people learned to ignore them, summoning was often seen as a waste
---
My point is that ignoring them and seeing them as a waste happened once the BG was turned into a race.
---
&gt; and they mostly just existed to slightly push a turtle one way. 
---
That was the ***entire point*** of their existence. They were turtle breakers. They were a rallying point for pushing.
---
I think it was confirmed that Classic would have a world chat too.
---
I misubderstood you and I agree that searing gorge and Steppes will be a hell with or without BGs. Ungoro have the devilsaurs roaming aswell
---
Strikes me it's a mage doing what it should be doing. We used to get priest/mage wrecking ball parties in AV.
---
It's not hard at all man just run some living strats as tank with like first righteous orb reserved for you. You'll make plenty of gold that way tanking.
---
&gt; Maybe that will cause shaman, druid, paladin and hunter to become viable in PvE
---
They're all not just viable but *wanted* in a pve scenario.
---
This just isn't remotely viable. You would more time grinding than actually raiding or pvping.
---
Eh they genuinely did. Will on launch 2, on every server.
---
Bad survey; you don't have a No (NA) and No (EU) option so it's really just going to be a poll of how many people on this sub are from US and how many are from EU. Really bad question/sample bias.
---
You’ll find out for yourself when you come to the forums to bitch about balance, lmao
---
I believe that the wall-climbing that enabled that glitch was patched out by 1.12, so in the Classic re-launch, things that relied upon it won't work. I know this doesn't answer your question but its the best I've got for you! I also don't know this for sure, just repeating some hearsay I've seen on the bug report forums a few times.
---
What's a warfront? Some new mmo?
---
Game breaking downsides?
---
Vuhdo is not really much different than something like Grid, but for me it is a fucking nightmare to set up comparatively. 
---
The only thing I've found Vuhdo does that Grid can't do is give you the ability to always display your own group first with your own bar first. 
---
If you ever have seen Joshpriest stream this is an essential feature for his UI. I like the idea of not having redundant information on screen so his setup is pretty cool to me. I used Vuhdo a bit purely to replicate that. 
---
Have since gone back to Grid, which is what I've used basically since it was created. I don't regret that.
---
They are going to kill retail with this rerelease, I hope
---
...classic didn’t forget it was being played
---
if they make a new mmo it will likley be a new IP. everything you said is something they could do in an xpac
---
oh and no they wont ever get rif of LFR, in an interview i forget who with they tapked about regretting giving players some things but once you give those things to players you cant really take them away
---
every xpac they are stuck supporting the toys previous developers decided to give to players because they change the game so much
---
Sometimes I wish they would have finished class reworks during Vanilla instead of rushing to TBC and finishing them over there..
---
My man, what you’re sure of or not I won’t question, but to just blindly assert that Blizzard has checked without any proof is silly.
---
I’m fine with mobs hitting for less than people remember, be it dungeons or out in the world.
---
The only thing I want to know is if it’s ACCURATE. In case you don’t remember, Blizzard got rogue regen rates in the demo completely wrong, and while I’m not questioning the current regen rates that have actually been checked and proven correct, they CAN make mistakes nonetheless. 
---
All I want is for every single detail to be checked and polished, I don’t think that’s too much to ask for a 15 year old game now is it?
---
Killed Sapphiron before TBC.
---
I dont even remember the e-mail and pass, can I recover it with the CD key from the boxes?
---
I could be wrong since my memory of leveling my druid was during the very start of vanilla but won't you have to go all the way back to get and do your quests for your bear and aqua forms and the spell to remove poisons? If so I would recommend waiting until you get the aqua form quest as it sends you to westfall anyways.
---
Yeah, even if it's not anyone of todays big wow streamers. There will most certanly be people streaming on each server. I know I will be one to search for streamers on twitch with my own servers name when classic is here.
---
Maybe this will also level out the viewers of all streams when each realm has their own locally famous streamer. And this worry about streamers ruining servers will go down.
---
Thus indirectly stating he plans on playing on a pve server.
---
Yep for its subtle distinction and renaming, layering is defo gonna mess with this. I know i know, the launch would be genuinely horrible without it, but i still would prefer it without all the same. Yes, i know what that means, no i won't change my mind when exposed to it. (the amount of ppl who like to go ''you think you do, but you dont'' when i claim this is absurd. Bugger off with it)
---
No. :) We want this game to be busted. Its what we fell in love with. Leave it as is and ship it out pls.
---
Fury is fantastic PvE DPS
---
Can't speak to the system in Retail, but the Vanilla structure *absolutely* encourages you to fight. You can't communicate with other players, can't reassure them that you're a nice guy. And now you and he both need to access nessingwary's camp. You can gamble that he might be cool too, but that's risky. And now, in the distance, you see a member of his faction passing by. What if they come over here too? Only one of them needs to start some shit and the other will join in, caus thats just how it goes. So now you can either kill him to keep the number of living enemies low (and piss him off), or you can gamble that the other guy won't come over, or if he does he will be cool too.
---
So much game theory goes into an encounter like that, and it is, in my opinion, the quintessential Warcraft experience. The whole Alliance/Horde conflict is driven by two sides that both want piece, but devolve into war because neither side can really trust the other. And that is *so cool* to me.
---
&gt; A change in the gameplay of WoW Classic, which would go against it's pilosophy.
---
Fair point, but I feel like that argument could have been made for ANY of the content patches added to Vanilla.   
---
BGs.   
---
ZG.  
---
Silithus.   
---
&gt;Messing with the avaliable pool of players is dangerous. Risky.    
---
It worked :)
---
They've literally mentioned it in the initial blue post announcement too.
---
Nah, but he/she will need that time to get used to the changes in game play for classic.
---
P1 is when honor system is introduced.
---
AKA never has to farm for any content after MC, lol
---
This is still a fair goal but realistically this still makes like 80% of the grind irrelevant when you have an entire guild handing you consumables and suddenly get to only raidlog with no consequence
---
That is where it was.
---
Unless a quest states otherwise. Rogue quest to pick Gamon's pockets for a key for the quest to open a lockbox.
---
Does the +5 Bow Troll Racial ever realistically effect weapon progression? Is there a Bow between Ash‘jretul and Nerub Slavemaker worth taking just for trolls?
---
What bad effect does a streamer have on a server?
---
It's pretty much just a direct fork of a BfA addon with no changed aside from the name of the addon. For example https://www.diffchecker.com/qZxY2wQT
---
* What should I do to avoid having bad reputation on the server I'm playing on?  **Be nice, help strangers and invite people to parties for quests. Just be friendly and helpful and it'll come back to you!**
---
* What race would probably be the "best" for tanking? The best class is Warrior and I'm curios if Tauren is a good choice or should I go something else? (I really want to play a Tauren but I'm still interested in your opinions) **Orc most likely, though for PvE tanking Tauren is pretty nice. War Stomp is GREAT when you lose aggro (it'll happen a lot) so you have a second to wait for the Thunder Clap cooldown. Also the 5% health bonus is nice.**
---
* What is the most needed profession later on in the game so I can help everyone out with their needs? **For PvP Engineering, though for a warrior I always just went blacksmithing and mining. Come crafted items are pretty nice.**
---
* Are there guides out there how to play the Warrior correctly? Also asking because of Talents and stuff. **Plenty! Google is full of them.**
---
* Adding this to my question before: Is there a way to reroll talents or spec so that I have faster/easier leveling with an aggressive spec but can reroll to a tank later on? **There is no dual spec in classic and changing talents will cost you a /lot/ of gold eventually. I advise to just level with tank spec and your healer gf. You'll find dps for quests no problem, since it's classic.**
---
* What is the best gear for a tanking Warrior and how do I obtain it? **Dungeons, raids and crafting (hence blacksmithing)**
---
To be fair, a good part of the code from vanilla was his own coding, and the others have seen moved on to greener pastures, so he would be the logical only choice to do this.
---
Sorry to say that but happy flipping.
---
Also, what could Blizz possibly do? If they try to prohibit it, reserver just won't invite anyone who may need that item.
---
I too saw Asmongold talking about this very thing.
---
&gt; And classic is built on classic (not on legion)
---
Yes, not on legion, but on bfa.
---
"They" being one of the developers. Ion later said there will be absolutely no changes.
---
It's understandable that a developer is not well versed in talking to the press and his enthusiasm getting the better of him. Blizzard's stance is that they are listening to what people want but that doesn't include "Post-Naxx content". (At least currently.)
---
9 classes playable if you get good
---
He's right in a sense that there are going to be people streaming on every server.
---
However, people will only really be affected by large streamers, the smaller that only average about 3 viewers two of those being their family members have about the same effect as someome that just plays the game. So no, not every server is going to be a streamer server, I get what they are saying but its a dumb jaded thing to say.
---
They've been like that for years. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. As someone else said it seems to work fine with the twitch app though.
---
0/10 
---
Don't take this obvious bait.
---
True
---
Typically for a stress test they flag the additional accounts needed for a 24-48hr period only. You \*MAY\* get an email explaining this ahead of time and once the stress test is over, so is your access.
---
Its like i am seeing all of reddits delusions about classes in wow classic in a single post.
---
Someone said that a majority of the people invited so far are from older accounts but not all of them. But a Blizzard employee said they want people that have played since vanilla and ones that have just started in bfa so they get opinions from every extreme and everything in between.
---
For some reason, I loved scenarios in panda land. I was a heroic raider who hit full bis every tier that expansion. I’d go into scenarios and heroic dungeons and tank/heal/dps as an spriest doing &gt;50% of the damage. 
---
Warfronts and Expeditions are terrible. I can’t stand them.
---
QQ
---
same, was playing up until about 4-5months ago but just not like bfa that much but the chance at classic beta got me to resub earlier than i was going to
---
What I meant was that turtles almost always towards iceblood, snowfall, or stonehearth, all out of their grasp unless somebody aggroed.  When somebody would aggro, it just meant they'd push one of those initial GY's before bowing out.  Just questioning each other's memory so can't really argue with you, but I'm of the opinion that people overstate their initial power as it was severely limited by their AI/leash to mid.
---
There is a pro and con to this, the con being the streamer is going to be the center of attention and create this annoying groups and depending on the streamer just f*ck with people or Horde resource nodes for the streamer etc, but the pro being the more eyes on Classic the better, I want people trying Classic who've never even played WoW and since Classic has re ignited a lot of discussion about World of Warcraft in the gaming community in general I hope people will tune into these streams and decide to jump in themselves.
---
If they actually do what they've said I'm ok with it, but stuff like this shouldn't be happening:
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/InventiveSlipperyBaguetteKAPOW](https://clips.twitch.tv/InventiveSlipperyBaguetteKAPOW)
---
No, I agree reporting bugs is good. The damage stuff has been reported through in-game and out-of-game means numerous times, so I'm sure they will investigate it in case they haven't already.
---
I'm just tired of people saying "ZOMG the elites do like no damege!!" with absolutely no proof whatsoever, like the person I was originally replying to did. Especially when we as a community have direct evidence of the contrary. Until Blizzard says something about it, that's all we have to go by: the fact that there's video evidence that mob damage is, outside of a single unclear exception, working exactly as it should, and the fact that mob damage is something that's extremely unlikely to be bugged in the first place due to technical reasons.
---
I hope Blizz has a plan for this, but I suspect that two streamers who pull over 20K regular viewers are going to REALLY overpopulate a server.
---
And we don't know if Blizz has any plans to cap out how many people / layers can be created for a server. 
---
What if these guys (and all those other streamers) all roll on "New Tichondrius", and "New Tichondrius" ends up with a 10K active player userbase even after the first few weeks? Will Blizz still force everyone onto one "layer" and implement crazy queue times?
---
I imagine you'll be able to play until 30, but you only have like 72 hours before it's all over.
---
Love your philosophy. I'm trying to pull together a group of friends for endgame content (all played back in the day to at least Nef) and it looks like you would suit us perfectly. I will try to coordinate us all to apply soon.
---
Imagine an addon trying to force you to 2 dps a dungeon
---
Tbh back in the day we laughed about people who were buying cosmetics. Rly I don‘t mind about cosmetics. As long as they don‘t give a gameplay advantage like not having to farm gold for the mount and stuff. I don‘t want it but I‘m not angry if they decide to ad it
---
I don't think there's many people on the beta intentionally reporting things they know aren't bugs because they don't like the game. 
---
Classic wow had a lot of weird and random features for the fuck of it and it's better to report everything that seems off and let blizzard figure out what's original and what's not. It's far from embarrassing for a player to report something weird and move on even if that thing was part of the original game. It's not on players to make sure the game is authentic to the original or for them to remember or research how it was, they're testing it and reporting what they find that's all.
---
&gt;  2500 or so server cap
---
is that a fact ? 100%?
---
Can't watch the video because @ work right now, but there are several advantages playing on a streamer server. Higher Population, PvP events, PvE events, active economy.  
---
Of course they are going to be assholes and whatnot, but they are in every community more or less.
---
In the end it's the same on a server without streamer(s). People hang around in cities and you will compete for questmobs, nodes, etc.
---
yeah, thought so. Hopefully they’ll make a blue post beforehand sort of explaining everything.
---
I used to only play exclusively pve servers, but my first pvp server experience was actually pretty nice. Redridge kind of sucked and on one of my characters I didn't even finish the elite quests because horde was sitting on them, but honestly it was just a matter of switching to a new quest if one was being camped. Ashenvale was awesome and I was constantly part of this tension when I saw horde questing around me. Got killed a few times by some twinks, but mostly just got in even fights. I even ended up getting in a 5 man group and starting a pretty big brawl outside of the horde camp. Plus I went to Stonetalon mountains and had some good duels with people close to my level. I'll admit I didn't quest in STV so I'll have to make an alt and try that out, but so far it has added a really cool extra layer. Don't get me wrong, I'm still conflicted, but I'm leaning more towards pvp for classic at the moment.
---
Biggest issue for me was that it seemed like the alliance really doesn't like WPVP all that much so when there was a group of twinks ganking, I had a hard time getting a group going to put a stop to them, but I will stay with my faction and try to be the spark that ignites pvp in my server. We'll see!
---
Yes! I did the same and I was so hyped, I stayed up half the night
---
It's really hard to put an exact number on because the money you make will make you more money, even if you drop skinning at level 10 you'll continue to make more and more money than someone who didn't even get it in the first place (all else being equal of course)
---
One of the developers said it. I'm sure he was caught up in the moment and his enthusiasm got the better of him.
---
Later Ion categorically said that there will be absolutely no changes. What they are open to is Classic TBC and Wrath down the line.
---
&gt; everything Asmongold says is untrue
---
That's the exact thing I was describing: half of the playerbase has the exact same oppinion like you, half of the playerbase wants vanilla wow "exactly as it was". The biggest argument for making Blizz release Classic was that private servers were/still are very popular (to the point of more than 1 mil players play there) - **all** the vanilla private servers use the actual, original 1.12 wow client, exactly as it was back then. It's going to be interesting at the official Classic release when many people will not expect the modern graphics things they added into Classic.
---
Point of reference for level 20, I’m at ~4 gold, not just including skinning.
---
Hoping for ModUI
---
I've been wondering this as well. [This](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule) is all the official info I can find. 
---
* Stress Test Schedule:
---
* Stress Test 1: Wed May 22–Thurs May 23
---
* Stress Test 2: Wed Jun 19– Thurs Jun 20
---
* Stress Test 3: Thurs Jul 18– Fri July 19
---
I ***hope*** what this means is that they're inviting A LOT of players each stress test and that you get to keep beta access after the stress tests. But yeah, I guess we just have to wait and see.
---
Oh thank god, gonna be leveling shaman and I need that in my life asap.
---
Okay so first of all go the right Support Page. EU or US..
---
Then:
---
1. Remember your Charakter Name and your Realm you played on
---
2. Send some more infos they ask, which you can answer most probably
---
3. I send also a passport, but that is not necessary
---
4. 24h later they recovered my characters. 
---
That was super easy to be honest and fast :)
---
I just hope the hype doesn't die down in the coming 3 months until release. Does anyone know if/when they'll be releasing a full beta? Or will 30 be the max for the whole duration?
---
Watch the video later and tell me if you still think that
---
Perfect, only an active sub is required. Thanks!
---
Youre a dickhead
---
Streamers don’t help the game. Fanboy shit is crap. Generally they are not the best players. Just crap
---
Well ya but blizzard servers just don’t carry that many people
---
People do it when they get a big enough 2h upgrade and their 1handers haven’t caught up yet. It’s not that weird.
---
I wouldnt be so sure. Classic Wow is basically a glorified reskin of retail; thats where this bug comes from. If they havent fixed it on two years of retail I'm not sure they'll care enough for classic. Really hope I'm wrong
---
I don’t recall, but the default is more than adequate.
---
People are saying it’s easy to make gold in the Beta. Mobs are dropping a lot of green items apparently.
---
Only certain zones of water in vanilla was transparent, the majority wasn't. With the 'modern' water, pretty much all of it transparent.
---
Well, it's capped at 30 now ? LoL thanks for telling me that no way I'm paying for this until it's the full thing.  
---
I don't think 30 is representative enough, don't have all your spells etc... Besides I'm going in for the end game content and pvp. No friends of mine want to play again so I'm not going for the merry friendship go on a quest. I'm going in for this full T2 rogue action (or whatever set is good stats wise) and the insane end game griding.  
---
I'm not too worried about learning the quests, no need to be the first ding 60 of your server as mong as you're in the reasonable "first wave" to lock your spot in some raiding / dungeoning groups. So don't care if I lose a week or so.
---
We are in agreement then! Have a nice day man :)
---
damn thanks, really good points.
---
how else would you attract 14 year olds?
---
With layering they will you just won’t see them.
---
The imbalance is what makes vanilla special. I roll resto HL PVE Druid. And every time a priest or paladin underheals me- I know that it’s not just the class, that I’m genuinely better then them. some people want to start as the underdog.
---
Kenco had two threat research guides (#1 in Jan '06, #2 in July '06).  Battle shout threat was part of his second research (which is not included in the link above).  
---
[This ClassWow.Live](https://classicwow.live/guides/19/threat-guide-and-reference-table) guide on threat has info on both studies if you're interested in learning about them.     [Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20070216043503/http://evilempireguild.org:80/guides/kenco2.php) is an internet archive link to an original July '06 post of Kenco's #2 study.
---
Lol idiot
---
well we know stress test is 2 days and there are several of them
---
blizz has not clarified but that implies in some way they will open up access for those 2 days and close it off at the end.
---
i think people would be rather salty if they subbed for access and just get a 2 day 8nvite so im guessing they will just let anyone with an active sub log in.
---
if they just let anyone login though it could be too much for 2 servers so thats a possible problem.
---
the concept of 2 day stress test invites sounds pretty wierd i subbed for a chance at the beta not just 2 days play
---
I bought this and didn't ask, but can I use this gift card balance to pay for a 6 month sub? I want to get the benefit of a discount from 6Mo. plus this discount.
---
Why is it ? Wanting to know what the developers think after launch (knowing it's a massive success) they deserve to be on the high chairs right now. Dontcha think ?
---
Like I said, we'll just have to kick back and see. For all we know they could do both; they don't need tons of extra subs for it to be worthwhile on their part.
---
Grid, SUF/Pitbull, Bartender, Quartz, OmniCC, SexyMap, Bagnon, and any clean chat mod. 
---
Would also love Details, Exorsus RT, Plater, obviously weakauras...
---
wall climbing was a thing in tbc tho.
---
That was a thing of beauty. Blood soaked Arathi Highlands.
---
It would have had to been prior to the 1.12 patches then as [1.12.0](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0) and [1.12.1](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.1) mostly just mention changes to dungeon and raid mobs. But I doubt they changed mob difficulty on a whole in Vanilla and most of this is a combination of fuzzy memories and private servers having to guess to fill in a lot of gaps on the server-side data. (Which itself has several issues) If you do find evidence to the contrary, then please link it though.
---
I'd say lets first see if this will hold, during stuff like WF races and content launches current WoW shoots up in viewership also.
---
Quick question, will I need to have classic downloaded to choose my name and if yes, can I download it now/will there be a link before the 13th?
---
!remindme 3 hours
---
No no and no.
---
I honestly did not have fun in my first warfront. It was tedious.
---
Couldnt disagree more. I think shamans are pretty fun early on. Till you have 15-20 totems to manage properly, then its not fun anymore gor me. This applies to most classes. I like most classes at 10 but only a few at 60.
---
Instant downvote without reasoning because of obvious trolling sorry.
---
You can rend in defensive stance btw
---
Ooo damn. 
---
How good is Fury via levelling? I love crits and haste.
---
Tyvm for the response. I was not sold on shaman before but now I'm looking forward to play one after hearing that.
---
Maybe it was just the server I played on but those types of battles still persist even after release of the honor system /shurg
---
&gt; Skinning targeting bug. When skinning a body, your target will reset to the skinned body when the loot window opens.
---
No, that's how it is supposed to be...
---
Hi, /u/Pyromania11
---
He literally yesterday asked for a tradeable for the WW axe quest because he only 4 gold.
---
That's what I'm saying. Spamming "LF2M Scholo" every five seconds in a chat channel to stay visible isn't some fantastic community building thing, if anything it ruins it because people are essentially trying to scream the loudest.
---
What made the community amazing was how you communicated with people on your server outside of those channels.
---
Party/guild/raid chat and /say is where the magic happens.
---
Apart from being a cool dude, he’s mind-boggingly good. Atleast at rogue.
---
Yeah I get it but it's the nature of the internet right, you're just never going to please everyone.
---
Hi, great platform! Can I suggest some features? How about [classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com) instead of [classicdb.ch](https://classicdb.ch)? And It would be awesome if we could switch to different languages. There will be different localisations and it might be too difficult to follow guides on english.

There is no ferql dpa wepon in the game until the AQ phase
---
Please just stop. Play retail you will be subbed there as well.
---
I think it would be nice to, I'd like and I think it's the correct thing to do for consumers. I just dont think it's the correct thing to so for money.
---
Multi-mail is in as it doesn't change anything gameplay wise except how long it takes to mail multiple items.
---
Guild banks will not be in as it changes the social dynamic of guilds. Guild bank alts require trust, trust brings people closer.
---
I mean, I know Kodos are this weird kinda horse thing, but in terms of their physiology, their legs seem to function a lot closer to some sort of lizard than any type of mammal. 
---
The rhinos you linked have.. entirely different legs than the kodo. The main thing is the low ground clearance of the kodo. I feel like to try to make them gallop you'd have to have them kicking their legs up above their belly, which would just.. look crazy. 
---
I personally think its hilarious riding a 100% speed kodo. i wouldn't give up that animation for anything.
---
Were you 2 then? Because you sure as fuck don't sound like an adult now.
---
By the time of WoW, all the allied and horde races are severely depleted on manpower, to the point where the mood should be extrmemely depressing since probably more than 50% of their populations are dead or fragmented after WC3.
---
The Orcs are extremely fragmented, a great deal of their population on Draenor and the Blackrock Clan leading parts of other clans as well. They also took large casualities on Kalimdor, especially the Warsong clan.
---
The Tauren were a small race in terms of numbers and were nearly eliminated by the time the Orcs found them.
---
The Forsaken are only a small splinter faction of the Scourge and Sylvannas ability to control anymore seems limited.
---
The trolls are only 1 clan of many and shouldnt have large numbers to begin with.
---
If you look at the Alliance however, all except the dwarves got wrecked even worse than the Horde.
---
The 2 strongest human kingdoms, Lordaeron and Dalaran are devastated. Alterac is also devastated, with even the remnants becoming hostile. Stromgarde is also completely devastated. Kul tiras and Gilneas are no longer actively supporting the Alliance,  leaving only Azeroth and Theramore at good strength. Theyre down to a small fraction of their former strength.
---
The Night Elves have lost their immortality and took the brunt of the invasion of Kalimdor.
---
The gnomes are also in an extremely bad spot, with the majority of their capitals population now lepers, many also killed by Troggs.
---
The Dwarves are the only ones in good shape, having not experienced any major invasion or major losses.
---
The power dynamic was really good at this point, i liked that the Human leadership was a bit more marginalized, and it was clear that the Dwarves were becoming more prominent. Then of course the garbage writing took over and somehow the Humans came back with unlimited resources and mnanpower as soon as Varian took the stage.
---
And i am truly amazed how this human wannabe creature called Asmongold is even having that many viewers. Im not a streamer but a regular gamer and i do watch some streams from time to time, i like Trillebartom whos not that big in audience and also on USA side i like Ven and the best shaman period.. as for asmon i clicked hin once .. his face expressions and everything he talks is like im watching someone beyond brain damaged. The worst part is that there will be nothing wrong if he was but to see he is a normal person whos not suffering any head trauma and hea acting and speaks the way he does... good lord!
---
Never again lol :)
---
You have no idea.
---
Shitty thing is I won’t know what servers they will be on and I could just lose the server lottery.
---
Even if vanilla was coming out for the first time now, it would be different from what it was because this is 2019 and the internet is a different place with better and more accessible tools. This is a reality that you can only curtail so much with restrictions on the game. At a certain point it's going to play out the way it plays out. Everyone should try to enjoy it, looks fun so far.
---
This has a major flaw : everyone with beta access is playing beta, not reading reddit
---
Points for effort though and I voted
---
When they first boosted the warmode bonus for alliance (I'm alliance) and gave good rewards for the weekly wpvp quest I got into some decent battles. Sharding mostly ruins it though, there were plenty of full zergs running around, but no one formed counter zergs. The nice battles I got was us forming a group or two of more coordinated players and slowly trying to pick the zerg apart. Failing most of the time, but it was still pretty fun. There was some big battles at world bosses. But now later in the patch cycle wPvP is completely dead as far as I'm aware. Not that I'm out in the world much, have finished all my grinds by now, and stocked up on consumables and stuff for the next few months.
---
 Well yes I would hope that I wouldn't have to state no quest items except the ones that specifically say you have to pickpocket. The point I was getting at was that you aren't gonna pick pocket any goblin nutsacks or human skulls out of pockets.
---
That was appalling. I kind of figured they realized from Destiny 1 that they needed to seriously beef up the social infrastructure, and instead they somehow.. made it even worse...
---
If Destiny 2 had even had chat in the tower and something like a general chat for every 500 or so people in a particular area (I'm thinking like, Diablo 3 general chat) just the social elements alone would have made the game nearly 3x more enjoyable.. and oh goodness proximity chat could have been so much fun
---
Dark souls is an mmo?
---
People think MTX are bad for business because subs fell. But with MTX development costs also plummet. 
---
10m subs for which you always have to innovate to keep subbs for 150m euros a month, having to keep 1000s of employees vs few hundred that just change skins a bit and produce much cheaper products just to sell those MTXs. 
---
Now you have around 2 to 3m subs that on average spend x3 a month compared to previous users while being able to have half the developers around. When you take into account that their paychecks are sometimes worth 1000s of player subs and that you don't really need expensive creative types to re-skin mounts/armour/weapons it definitely helps. 
---
This goes much deeper as in development there is a thing called opportunity costs. Smashing developer heads against a competitive wall is no good. Better to have the bulk of them try and give us some new crap like mobile Diablo or the likes.
---
His logic is that since it's just a beta it doesnt count, which I guess is true, but still. 
---
I think once it launches one day a fan is going to offer him a rare BoE that he wants and that's the moment he breaks.
---
How do You apply for beta? ;o I tried to look for it but it seems like im being dumb i think
---
I will look into this.
---
Mouseover in classic beta is currently basically the same as retail. 
---
I can't imagine too many people having a problem with it considering vanilla had shit like decursive that basically played for you, and all that shit won't work. 
---
Healing will probably require more activity than it did in actual vanilla regardless of the mouseover situation. 
---
The biggest worry with mouseover for me is potentially giving rogues the ability to off CC without dropping combo points. One class that absolutely doesn't need any sort of improvement in PvP.
---
Just a few points that I've seen from bouncing around various streamers this past week: (From someone who has very rarely watched WoW Streams in the past)
---
StaySafe said specifically that he would not roll on the same server as Asmon/Soda and he even went as far as to say that if Tips did it would be "throwing the Classic community under the bus."
---
The only people I see play together right now on Alliance are Asmon and Esfan. 
---
Venruki and SonyDigital are both horde but I've only seen them play together during that big 40 man world PvP thing.
---
Soda said he would stay Horde even as a cow and I assume that's to combat Asmon viewer counts.
---
Shroud said he was going to be streaming Classic fulltime because whoever he is playing with right now promised him some Mace when they start raiding. I don't watch Shroud enough to know who/where he is playing though.
---
I don't loyally watch any streamers right now because I don't really like any of them aside from StaySafe and he always plays solo. Shifty lost me as a viewer when he went to a class trainer and couldn't figure out why they didn't teach him Staves. Towllie usually has a low viewer count and the only reason Venruki got 10k viewers this weekend is because he was on the opposite side of the World PvP thing with Asmon. It's the only reason I watched him lol
---
I have yet to see Preach live stream Classic, but that could be because of time zone differences. He would be my choice probably.
---
Right now EVERYONE is streaming Classic Beta because it's big money, but I'm pretty sure it will die down soon when the people who aren't diehard into Classic lose interest. Hopefully just avoiding Asmon and Soda will prevent any problems as others have already pointed out.
---
What kind of more updated graphics would you say? What they've added already is pretty much all the engine has in it that is modern, rest is all better/higher resolution assets (character models, textures, buildings etc) or additional lights placements (modern expansions use a ton of lights everywhere). Probably the only thing they could do is to allow the use of the modern player models, but that for sure won't feel anything like vanilla.
---
I mean from what i have experienced no one on the alliance uses two handers. They just don't do the same boss damage. All throughout the content and into naxx. And this is the private server community where everyone is a super tryhard.
---
Yeah guild bank was a great addition to the game, definitely one of the things I will miss in classic. 
---
Other than that it's frustrating that classes are kinda niche to one spec or another but at the same time I like that each one is very unique so it's a 50/50 to me.
---
That is the vanilla server cap, no reason to believe that they would change it. At the start the "Layering" system will distort that because each layer is probably going to be full server size but once the player count stabilizes and they remove that system the servers should cap out around there.
---
Big Battles with zero lag, fck yeah!
---
the TBC serve could work if done right, for example if you have a new server open up where you can start at level 60 with MC kit or import your vanilla character like you do when going onto PTR or normal beta and you can do the 60-70 levelling and all the TBC stuff on a seperate server to the classic content, down side is you would lose players from both classic and retail to the TBC sever so you slowly start to dilute your player base
---
i also find needing to sub to a game i dont play for a chance at beta testing rather repugnant.
---
i dont know why they didnt just sell a collectors edition that had a pet and granted beta access . i really expected some sort of classic collectors edition and beta access seemed like an obvious edition
---
pretty much same boat though i started closer to the end of vanilla , purchased and was subbed up to and including part of MoP the only expans8on ive never purchased is BFA not that it matters anyone who wants access should just be able to buy it
---
I must be fairly out of the loop, I swear this tips guy didnt exist a few months ago, now hes one of the first streamers mentioned with wow.
---
Boss 1. Shazzrah was basically decursive the boss. 
---
Several others in there were pretty similar.
---
More than not having it
---
One of the coolest streams i have ever seen.

Try watching shroud or soda for charisma. Also i'm sure dudebro is the wrong word. Since wouldn't a dudebro be more charismatic??
---
If by balanced you mean boring ass retail classes where all classes do the same then im glad itd not balanced.
---
At least 1
---
Well I’m in EU so I paid €800. Which is about equal to the amount in dollars I guess. I did not play the Beta. However I did play a bit BFA on it which has tougher system requirements than classic will because Classic will run on the Legion engine. And BFA works fine. I can max out the settings without issues. I’ve not tried to raid or do AV or something with max settings. But I’m quite sure it’s fine. Multi boxing on the other hand I’m really not sure because I’ve not tried to do that. But running alternate apps like YouTube and Spotify at the same time really was no problem at all.
---
This is a video from my Tauren Hunter's POV of my vanilla guild's first C'Thun kill. I don't remember exactly when it was recorded (I uploaded it to Google Video way back when, and it was later moved over to YouTube which reset the upload date), but I do remember having a hell of a fun time raiding back then!
---
You alright there, lil timmy? Wanna talk about it?
---
If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ...quiver?
---
Oh i know that, but compared to arms levelling - is fury any better or is it worse?
---
You are pathetic.
---
I'm interested in this as well.  One thing to consider is that Blizzard had originally intended battle shout to give a flat amount of threat when used and not for each party member it applied to.  They considered the party member multiplier a "bug" that did way more threat than intended and "fixed" it in 2.0.1.  You can find it in the bug fixes section of those patch notes.
---
The people asking for this stuff wont leave their starting zone.
---
Really hate comments like this. Without players like the OP as well as myself and many others... blizzard would not be the huge company it is today. They kinda do owe us a little something... my hope is they let more people like us into the stress test and allow us to continue playing thereafter.
---
The needs of the many...outweigh the needs of the few.
---
&gt;but I'm of the opinion that people overstate their initial power as it was severely limited by their AI/leash to mid.
---
Again, they were designed with OG AV in mind, when things actually occurred in the FoS. They needed that time to be buffed up by players and to gain strength via consuming enemies.
---
In early AV, if you team mates yelled "LOK IS UP!" your team rushed to his location and buffed/protected him. If your team mates yelled that the enemy's elemental was up, everyone ran to that location to attempt to kill it before it became buffed/unstoppable. That generated a SHIT TON of PVP.
---
Again, all of this occurred in OG AV due to actually having time to do it, because all of the NPC game pieces were there and at full strength. Removing and nerfing them made the elemental gods mostly obsolete.
---
thunderfury lol good luck
---
The game may not launch or stop working at any point in time as this series of GPUs isn't supported any more. Also those are hot and ultra loud cards. AMD RX 470 right now is super cheap while having really good performance.
---
Also - you want game on two screens? That may be tricky to get to work and also ultrawide display are much better for this (I use 21:9 3440x1440 display for WoW and other things and it's amazing).
---
I feel ya. It took me awhile to narrow it down to knowing I wanted to main a healer. Then it took me 2-4 weeks to narrow that down to Druid. Then another 2 weeks to narrow that to NE Druid.
---
Get over yourself.
---
I pity you.
---
To add on to this comment, the "game time" purchase offers the same discount as the sub. So if you were planning a 6 month sub, you can instead by 6 months of game time for the same price and use the gift cards.
---
Anyone playing the beta probably isn’t going to vote. Preoccupied haha.
---
To this day people say that instanced PvP killed World PvP. "Worked" isn't that simple, especially now that this isn't a regular launch, it's a preservation project.
---
"Grim Batol killed Molten Core, we need WoW Classic: Classic!"
---
Thanks for the response! I'm totally okay with multi-mail system. Is postage a flat rate of 30 copper or is it 30c per item sent?
---
It is actually 2 people. Sodapoppin is more a personality but still an extremely skilled druid.
---
It is when you get invaded by multiple Phantoms and have your own summoned.
---
FFXIV handle power creep pretty well, if you do old content you gain nothing from it if you do it un-synced at your max level, where as if you do it through the duty finder you get dropped to a level capped to the content and your gear is scaled down so the dungeon can still be a challenge
---
I mean, the fact that you linked his username...
---
I thought arenas were one of the greatest additions to WoW in BC.
---
But they also absolutely ruined the game. I've ranted about it on this board before, but arena moreso than any other feature ever introduced to the game is what forced Blizzard to totally homogenize the classes. When arena was introduced, some class sets were just so much stronger than others that certain classes just shouldn't even bother queueing up. As a result, now everyone has to have a 6 second interrupt, a 3 second stun, a breakable CC... etc.
---
I can’t do math. Is this a better deal than buying 6 months in advanced from blizzard subscription ?
---
Alright. So in English, we say similar to something, not similar compared to something. That might be the cause of the confusion.
---
i hope you get banned from this subreddit
---
Esfand is fucking awesome
---
Depends how badly you want to raid, healers will always be more desirable for that.
---
&gt; Spaghetti code. Probably would require a lot of resources to fix and it's not worth it from a business perspective when they have expansions and patch content to make. Sucks.
---
You've made like 5 assumptions in two sentences. I'm impressed.
---
With a bit of luck we might all spawn in at a certain level 20/40/60 With a custom designed set of gear to go and do any dungeon raid world event we like. That sounds like how you're going to get the best results to stress a server. 
---
It could also just be something like levelling 1 to 20 and seeing how the zones react to that many people on launch
---
I remember when they said they wouldnt do Classic. Isnt there a famous quote for that too?   
---
Its almost like they can change their mind on stuff. If Classic becomes really big you can bet your ass they will reconsider this stance - assuming enough people want it. Whether or not its good for the game is a different question. But you are a fool if you think 3 years from now this statement holds a lot of value
---
if you've even been paying attention, stay safe said he wasn't going to play on the same server as asmongold and them...
---
They really don't though - they provide a service/product and we pay for it.
---
They're under no obligation to provide you with access just because you want it.
---
Ill be real i hope blizz breaks dbm. Its probably gonna make mc too easy for people who dont pay attention
---
It's mostly because they are able to talk and discuss things, I guarantee you more than half of the viewers are doing something else themselves while listening to the streamer. That's why streaming is hard, you need charisma and be able to constantly entertain people.
---
Unless you're watching programers stream but that's now the case for classic.
---
You realize if they don’t require an active sub for beta, you could just sign up for 1000 accounts then sell extra beta keys right.
---
we are only in like week one of a 9 week beta. i'm confident we will all get it.
---
I need a dps meter! please!
---
Screw the many, I want my damn fighters to stop getting stuck on asteroids or farting along like my Nan at a line dance
---
Maybe streamers won't have any following because people are having too much fun playing the game by themselves.
---
Endgame in a MMORPG ist not synonymous to raiding or battlegrounds.
---
This is the main difference between Classic and its successors. 
---
Every spec is viable for specific things. But not every spec is viable for raiding.
---
Felt bad for his Dog watching him stream. Guy plays 10 Hours straight, occasionally screams like a retard and just never walks his Dog. Maybe i missed it. But yeah, just felt bad for his Dog.
---
I don't wanna see a balance update either in Classic, but stop calling out bait on everything you disagree with. This guy just mains a class that he perceives as under powered in Vanilla and would like to see buffed, no bait involved at all.
---
yeah fair enough
---
tbh when i tried horde a few times on pservers i didnt knkw where any flight points were i just want to see if i can test and get comfortable with the hord zones/towns . lol i kept walking into alliance towns looking for a fp
---
RP or PVE servers are definitely going to be more mature and less toxic than PvE servers
---
Not every single person is a Purist my dude.
---
That's one way to handle it. Do you get any worthwhile rewards from doing the scaled down content?
---
&gt;because they know many people fucking hate streamers and the bad effects they have on servers.
---
I haven't played in a while and am out of the loop. Why is that the case?
---
There are so many people watching the classic streams right now, so surely not everyone can hate streamers that much?
---
You want sulfuras asap. Class does not matter in this regard so much as your ability to convince 39 other people to raid with you for months and pass you priority.
---
Plenty of people who play the game will stream it because they can. But 99% of them will be invisible to you in-game. Someone who just streams their solo or guild or random group play doesn't really have any impact on other players on the server. And even people who do some play with viewers streams or whatever will be totally indistinguishable from any other ordinary people grouping up to play.
---
Look at Classic streamers who have even 1,000 viewers, and there are only a handful of those. Most have between 10s and a few hundred at most. Those are not the people being followed around by throngs of trolls everywhere in-game. Because most people are watching streams specifically during times *when they can't be in-game*. Look at the groups that follow someone huge like Asmongold around and it's a vanishingly tiny segment of his viewerbase, even though it looks like a crazy large number of people in-game. Like he may have 25-50-100k viewers, and he'll have between dozens and hundreds at most following him around. The groups around him look overwhelming on screen, but in terms of percentage of his viewer base it's a rounding error. Point is, people who have even 1,000 viewers just aren't going to ever draw in-game crowds large enough to ever be noticed or to affect anything.
---
Sure, there "will be streamers on every server" because plenty of people who play the game also will stream it. But there never will be more than half a dozen of those people in the entire world who will have any impact on anyone else's in-game experience just due to the fact that they're streaming. And it won't be hard to figure out where those handful of folks are playing, since most of them are going to wind up on the same server anyway because they want to play together for the sake of the sake of the content they're making.
---
Face the fact that youre a nobody.
---
This is far too inflammatory (Rule #2). Sorry, post removed.
---
To be fair to this guy, consumers of video games are not used to accepting a game AS IS and it's out of their comfort zone to not provide feedback like this
---
I'd argue that I won't die if I pull 1 mob and risk if I pull 2 anyway :) I agree that hamstring is a good thing to reduce downtime, and slow weapon indeed help with it; my bad for forgetting about it.
---
I mean, I dont like BfA either. I stopped playing near the beginning of Cata. Haven't subbed since. I'm basically in your shoes, I'm not subbing to gamble on getting into a beta.
---
That said, I can understand why a company would want to reward people who are currently supporting their game lol
---
&gt; quests/npc's that were entire zones away from their objectives 
---
I've always found the whole "they didn't know what they were doing" feeling I get from vanilla quest design to be a part that makes the world just that much more fun.  Yes, going from the shimmering flats to booty bay might take a while, but it connects the world together in ways that breadcrumb quests don't.
---
&gt;they won't have the anonymity of being just another adventurer 
---
They could always just *not* stream and just play?
---
Your friends are wrong. "Several huge steps back" to when WoW had 8 million subs.
---
They were really outnumbered by the end. Horde was more organized as well.
---
People love to watch streamers, but playing on the same servers as them is a nightmare. Here's why.
---
Here's the thing with loot trading tho. As soon as it becomes the norm to roll on everything and sell the item to those who actually need/want it, it will be gone. This is already and issue in the beta, and I expect it to be addressed.
---
It will be a testament to the how good the WoW QoL dev team is as evaluating QoL. People will be begging for old school loot ninja's
---
Who gives a shit?
---
I started in 2004 with the Closed Beta, Kid.
---
So you dropped 30 bucks on glimmer of hope to get into a beta. That's a sound investment
---
My achievements stem from meeting my guildies in vanilla. 
---
-Top healer in Vodka, contender for best Druid Healer US
---
-TOP US/World Raid clears from Vanilla to Cata
---
- World First %80 of ICC
---
-Went to highscool and friends with US #1 Hunter (MegaTF) in PVP.
---
You too, buddy.
---
If there aren't any Rp-PvP servers the community will end up designating a PvP server as the unofficial RpPvp server. I'd wait for that if you loked rppvp
---
2H fury is interestingly the best leveling spec pre 40, and then arms will outclass it with mortal strike after that. Fury talents are just so much better for the most part until arms can get mortal. 2H fury plays strange IMO, and you can’t stance dance or you will dump all your rage, but it has an edge on efficiency.
---
You literally know nothing about the game
---
Feels damn good to be EU. That said, I have no problem with streamers with a small following, in fact I think they're good for overall server pop. It's just the likes of Asmon and Soda that are toxic for the game. When it comes to EU I can't think of very many people who will commit to Classic. All the big names are Method people, and I imagine they wouldn't spend too much time outside of live wow. EU will be a pretty safe haven I'd imagine.
---
i'm going for hunter this time :O which is funny cos i always flamed them but its the only class i dont know really well so it will be a bit of a new experience
---
originally i wanted to play a pala but the thing that changed my mind was remembering how much i'd have to buff people in raids.  i played a druid on ely and i was one of 2-3 in each raid and i just got so fed up of rebuffing ppl who died and then drinking then catching up to the raid etc etc
---
which is a shame because i love pala lore and i really wanted to play one but there you go!
---
how about you?
---
&gt;Fair point, but I feel like that argument could have been made for ANY of the content patches added to Vanilla.
---
That argument can be made for literally any content beyond the starting area. 
---
It's the nature of progression. Once people got everything they want in one area, be it XP, skills, mounts or items, you add new areas, be it open world or instanced, where people can get new stuff, whether it be via levels or gear, whether it be vertical or horizontal progression. 
---
Only ways out is to make people either regress (XP loss upon death, item loss upon gank or similar mechanics) or stagnate forever. Neither is very motivating for players.
---
**&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
Hey everyone!
---
We are an Alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual".
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory.
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO.
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004.
---
**Raid Times (PST):**
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders.
---
**Membership:**
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move on. When they come back, its like they never left.
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100% sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have a full 40 members every raid.
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is great for members of our guild.
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals.
---

just lvl a hunter and have him supply the warrior. respec fury/prot once a week for progression raiding. 100g are easily farmed in 2 hours with a hunter.

---
Losing out on an evening of gaming because you're stuck in Stormwind is a huge reason why I'm rolling a warrior.
---
I don't know how they would block it, I'm not a game developer.
---
Classic will run the Legion Client. So If you could play Legion with out issue. You're fine for Classic.
---
chances are they will run it the same as they have done the expansion beta invites, once you are in you are in to the end of beta when it is all wiped.
---
they may well do larger waves leading up to the stress tests to really get the servers packed but normally you will only on to your beta after that as they want each stress test to have more people in than the last, you don't want everyone on for the first stress test you want to see where the breaking point is so you increase gradually.
---
but as has been stated only bilzz truly know i am just going with my experience from MoP legion and BFA betas when i was in them
---
...what
---
Hi, /u/enaske
---
The funny thing is that subbing after the beta released will not get you into the waves. You had to sub beforehand.
---
&gt;old Battlefield games
---
To give some perspective, the first Battlefield (1942) released in 2002, that's 2 years before wow released and it was perfectly capable of 64 players.
---
Well I always thought it would hit harder.
---
Go take tbc crusade discussion out of classic WoW then. I highly disagree with people who come into classic mostly excited about the burning crusade in the future. In my opinion all the real classic heads want to be here to discuss an actual open, fluent and unavoidable world. The classic WoW mentality doesn't have room for "can't wait for the expansion that isn't classic!!". Go take that shit to a tbc private server
---
I don't see Tips going solo on his own server. If Staysafe wants to go lone wolf that's his deal, but most of these other streamers have been playing beta together and having a good time. I find it difficult to believe they will not roll on the same server. It's a lot easier to group with people you know.
---
I don't see the point in competition. It is literally the same without a streamer.  
---
And a more populated server is a good thing.  
---
Server stability.. well, bringing a server down on purpose is bannable. And if this happens, it won't happen all the time.   
---
Can't say anything to point 4. Just streamer guilds are like normal guilds. There isn't anything special to that besides number of guild members.  
---
The thing with ingame chat = twitch chat... that is likely, but only in main cities or in specific zones. People who watch twitch don't speak like that everytime, you know. If the streamer is around then yes, but they won't spam PogChamp or widepeepoHappy in World Defense at 5am. But I see the point, it's going to piss people off in the first weeks/months.  
---
PvP leaks maybe, but stream sniping in WoW (besides ganking) is not likely. See popular WoW streamers and Arena, it is no problem on retail.  
---
Right click reporting is no valid point. Blizzard (maybe Ion, was on r/classicwow the last days) stated that the report function contains human elements (viewing reports). And if a big streamer reports anyone on stream without reason I am pretty sure thats bannable.  
---
Harassment can be a problem - we won't find out until release. In my opinion I got more hate on this sub than anywhere else, theres that.  
---
Leveling is literally the same. People start at release and every zone is overpopulated, streamer or not.  
---
And the last point I didn't even bother to watch. You, the player???
---
yeah he said on stream that he wasn't going to play on the same server as them
---
As long as your account is "active" you could be sent a beta invite.
---
Rogue by far i am pretty sure
---
PVE servers, RP in particular are filled with super and selfish people who only care about themselves.
---
On pservers I leveled very fast with spirit gear as 2h fury until 40 for mortal strike. Idk how spirit is going to be in classic. I'll test it if I get into the beta.
---
&gt; sperg-guilds 
---
I think it's the fact you can hear it really clearly or sounds super exasperated like wheezing, which usually comes from being a bit unhealthy,  having breathing issues or right in your mouth (eating) mics.
---
&gt; Talk-Wheeze-Talk-gulp-wheeze-talk.
---
There are ways to set up your mic to not have this be picked up by setting up the gains properly and having a mic right in your face. 
---
I agree with the OP that it is quite annoying to listen to, but I hope to not be as rude as he in the way he stated it.
---
Half his content on YT is shitty reactions to other youtubers content. It's pretty shitty and just shows he isnt creative enough to make his own content so he just rides the coat tails of other more interesting/knowledgeable content creators. Hes probably my least favorite next to Kargoz.
---
None of what you say makes any logical sense. There's nothing "holding you back". Classes are balanced - if balanced at all - WITH the top gear in mind. To the extent that naxx is tuned to have a certain number of warriors, it tuned for BWL/AQ40 gear, whether or not that gear has "efficient" stat allocation or not. Complaining about stat allocation is completely illogical!
---
Hey :(
---
Literally only doing it so i can watch his stream and feel like i have a friend to level with.
---
Yes exactly.
---
Well, heres the thing, if you actually watch the interview (was actually a open mic Q&amp;A) the question was asked "Have you ever thought about adding servers for previous expansions, how they were then?" The answer was "No."
---
My theory as to what happened some time AFTER that Q&amp;A, is that they started to think about adding servers for previous expansions, how they were then.
---
Effectively it's a PvE scenario in a revamped version of an old world zone that is dressed up like PvP. You have to capture different points in the zone and eventually work your way towards the enemy base and kill the commander. It's LFR difficulty by design and almost impossible to lose if you have a few people paying attention.
---
I’m speaking from my own pserver raiding experience too. Saw some guildies go through the situation described above, using BRE or Obsidian Edged to bridge an upgrade gap, and continuing to do top 5-10 DPS because furylol.
---
Think it also will be a question how long Soda / Asmon will last, from what i've seen atleast Soda never really sticks to something, as Asmon also might hop between current and classic. 
---
But some of the Method guys have pretty high viewership also, think Sco hit like 160k concurrent viewers during Ghuun progess in BFA.
---
It's only 20 dollars. Not a big deal. 
---
I spend 10 bucks a day on coffee so 20 dollars at a chance to play classic wow is well worth it in my opinion.
---
It's quite the opposite really. 
---
The best raiders in the history of the game--the people pushing mythic world firsts in retail--literally make custom weakauras for every boss to help them focus on maximizing their personal performance. The margin for error at the highest levels of retail raiding is so small it's basically tuned around people having extensive add-ons. 
---
Conversely any idiot can probably go into normal or heroic and be okay without any add-ons at all. 
---
I don't think there's the same urgency of personal performance at any point in vanilla, so I don't know that we'll see the same degree of weakauras and shit, but timers have always been a big part of serious raiding.
---
Sounds like a female dwarven hunter to me.Stoneform will be good against rogues, druids, warriors. Hunters have a high skill ceiling in pvp, the hardest class is warlock, I believe. You can use your pet to flag lowbies in the starting zone, by taming a boar, for example and naming it like the mobs around. Then using eyes of the beast to mimic the mobs, waiting for a newbie to attack you, thus flagging himself for pvp. Then it's free game. Hunters are nice counters to gankers (Lookin' at you, rogues).Theoretically... you can aquire Thunderfury... Has cool gear and is a farming machine. You can do tribute runs in dire maul. Can kite a lot of bullshit to big cities...You can heal. Your pet. Don't forget to roll on int stuff for your "pet heal eq", nevermind the angry healer, tell him to shut up and drink up, because you're going to pull! You always have your trusty tankard.. hidden in your beard... as female. Female dwarfs are super duper rare, btw. Oh and you can fear druids, because druids are afrait of everything, just like the cat of my girlfriend: afraid of its own fart. Next stop: PvE. Up until AQ40 you're going to be very good. After that there is a falloff. But you still rock in PvP. Your rotation can be fun. You can rotate trinkets in a fight. You can survive a wipe. You can lose aggro or reduce aggro in close combat. You can trap/slow enemies. Viper sting is pretty good for pvp, annoying enemy healers.
---
Tldr: read the unformated text.
---
Good luck and drink up!
---
Not idiots, but usually just children. Kids don’t care about consumer rights, and they love the wacky dramatic streamers. But any mature adult knows better.
---
Probably because he knows he has no chance at Scarab Lord if he's on the same server as Asmongold and Soda

Two years when everyone has content on farm, they release a TBC server.

How do you know this?

You work for blizzard?

Mounts were not usable in booty bay, therefore travel form shouldn't work either, right ?

---
You’re getting downvoted but I think your general sentiment is right, just poorly delivered. The audience of a private server is way different than a full blown game done by Blizzard, and it probably isn’t wise to assume pserver norms will be the same as live classic norms.
---
 Nixxiom has some great moments. Usually gives me a few laughs everytime I watch one of his streams. Preach is good too, I enjoy his content.
---
🤣 Wut
---
If you look up copyright law you'll see companies litterally HAVE TO shut that stuff down or they can lose their IP. Them inviting the Nost people shows that theres no ill will imo. As for the Betas length this is an old game, on top of that people have been testing it. Im sure they got a mountain of data from the Nost guys. CWoW Beta being an add is great for the game, I want as many people possible playing this wonderful game.
---
Dude seriously me too...hunter is by far my favorite class is but this might make me reroll if not fixed :(
---
I love this :D
---
Yeah the description is clearly passive aggressive trolling
---
Lol. Tbh, I will probably heavily rely on 1-60 "speed run" leveling guides.  I don't really care about the story, the atmosphere and the experience. I already had that when I played Vanilla, BC and TLK back in the days. I'm in it for the endgame content.  
---
So yeah, I'll probably cheese through the leveling phase cause fuck this lol.
---
you don't understand what he is saying.  if 80% of poll takers are from the US, it will skew the results   
---
so the poll will NOT in any way show if Blizzard invited more people from EU or NA.  The poll only shows most redditors are from the US.  And it shows EU players were invited.
---
Most people care? Who wants to risk playing on a shit server overran by fanbois?

Enjoy guys
---
That's not true, according to a blue post.
---
That's why I'll continue to ask for this in every streamer thread, Blizzard should set aside a few servers and declare them streamer free.  Streaming on those servers is a bannable offense.  That way those of us who don't want to have to deal with the affects of streaming won't have to.
---
Not very. Dwarf Priest is probably the most important one, but even that isnt necessary, it's just good.
---
Beyond that play what you want, the min/max approach to facials squeezes out fractions of percent towards better performance in most circimstances.
---
So 10 seconds of 10% spell haste is the best healing racial on horde, but it doesnt matter very much. You'll still get invited if your a cow Shammy.
---
I think there will be all sorts of people in all types of servers ... kind of like real life.
---
Just watch Shroud dude, he is really chill and nice.
---
Does it matter? I mean, yes obviously, they are different abilities. 
---
Does it really matter? No. 
---
Choose the one you rather stare at from behind for 40 days played. 
---
A dwarf priest is probably the best combo on alliance. But a female dwarf regardless of being a priest will get laughed at.
---
Cut it with equal parts water (or seltzer)
---
Me too! But as a warrior! Shaman comes after ;)
---
sadly the poll won't tell us if less EU players were invited or if it was more like a 50/50 split for invites
---
I still do, I installed it back in 2005 and I kinda stuck with it
---
Please add "Not invited yet (playing since 2005)" as the official release in the EU was 2005 not 2004
---
Ditto. I was thinking about that the other day. I hope they release a version for classic

Taken from wowhead.com, "Warfronts are a 20-man, PvE, large-scale cooperative mode meant to represent the large-scale war on the homefront, as members of each faction fight for control of a location critical to their war efforts."

Fair enough ! I went on a weird crusade in legion and got every class to 2k-2.5k pvp experience, so no fresh things for me. Or well, vanilla will still be as its so different. Going for a warlock ! I was a rogue and mage back then.
---
Is the mass buffing not something remedied a bit with the right addons? The buff is 15 minutes right? And there are more palas in a raid than druid as well, so less of a task myb? I do feel ya, aoe buffing is one thing i would not mind added in vanilla, but its a fine line to draw. Last thing i want it for it to diminish in any way its RPG aspects.
---
  I was 100% wrong on server transfers. Remembered poorly there.
---
I'm still 50/50 on the cash shop thing, I vaguely remember them mentioning they'd never, but recently the only talk about a cash shop are just amoung  the classic wow sphere, which makes finding solid information about it odd.
---
This link, which doesn't work anymore since the forums updated to their current forum.. and I checked the waybackmachine, still doesn't work: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/th...11962198&amp;sid=1 was a thread about people asking for blood elf warriors in 2006.

However, this thread talks about the thread a bit: https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/662944-Still-questioning-Blood-Elf-Warriors
---
This thread also references some other things blizzard has either said 'never' or 'no' to, It's not as in depth with links and the like unfortunately: https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/959500-Things-they-said-would-quot-Never-quot-happen-in-wow
---
A lot of threads were lost from the old forums, unfortunately.
---
Classic WoW is one thing they've said time and time again throughout the first time people started asking for it they will NEVER do and yet, here we are with classic on the horizon.

The top post in this thread has blizzard quotes, and links (that no longer work as a lot of older links dont.)

Actually, the streamer called Stay Safe told us during a stream that the XP split between a 2 man group on a private server was 50/50
---
BUT, on Classic Beta, the split is actually 60/60.
---
So he said it would almost be encouraged to level as a duo.
---
Yup, that’s what i meant, just didn’t deliver it well...or at all haha
---
He said that on Allcast I think is the name of the show. No gifts till he farms his epic mount solo.
---
Only if you are running in world first guilds. Most people will just want warm bodies to fill 40-man rosters. Especially after the initial hype dies down (assuming it will) and many leave because Classic is a completely different beast than most games nowadays.
---
no he made it sound like he's making a hardcore "18 hour/day" type guild and doesnt want to deal with the non sense that comes with the streamer server (long queues, etc)
---
Queremos la beta para nosotros!
---
Nous besoins jouer le beta!
---
Bisogno gioccare WoW Classic beta!
---
Vi förtjänar att spela beta också!
---
Die Deutschen müssen sicherstellen, dass die Beta effizient ist
---
România este deja reprezentată de Frostadamus, dar cum rămâne cu restul dintre noi ?!
---
Οι Έλληνες εφευρέθηκαν τη λέξη beta! Ως εκ τούτου, το αξίζουμε.
---
I say old chap do be a good sport and hand over access so we can ignore the politics.
---
Beta access innit bruv?
---
TBC is definitely happening if Classic is a big enough success.
---
Sums up how I feel about myself.
---
Nope. The troll racial lets you cast a little faster. Meaning a little faster heals every 3 minutes. 
---
But playing a walking steak, man. That's only something for gourmets. Look at the well fed bois. They have the greenest grass and they have a lot of room to roam about. They're pretty much safe in green mulgore, so no predators can actually hurt them. Don't pick a white skin colour, because there's a disease that affects that part of the skin. 
---
Play cow, they're delicious. Oh and females give milk after they had a calf. Lord, I'm hungry.

Unless a questing mod comes out(which it probably will), you'll have to read it to know where to go and what to do.
---
You do know the classic announcement is the top rated post of all time on /r/wow right? If the majority of them were haters why would they upvote that? There's tons of different opinions but most people I've talked to on /r/wow and people irl are excited for classic regardless of if they played it before or enjoy current retail
---
Rogue
---
Oh it makes sense I'm just too old and tired boys haha.
---
Well bfa is better for ppl with multiple core cpus
---
I will make sure I login asap to take those names on the server my guild choose. Then sell those streamers the names if they want them.
---
Really happy to see VuhDo on the list.  Healer main, and that's been my go-to addon for over 10 years.
---
For your case: Tauren shaman is absolutely fine, but troll has the edge. That means: if you want to play tauren - you pick tauren, if you don't care - then you pick troll. 
---
You can use the search function, there are thousands of posts written on this sub regarding this topic.

Oh god Kor'gall EU. My old home. Used to raid in "Crimson Blades"/"UNRATED" over on alliance side. Loved the video!

Hes wrong, but you still wasted your money if your not interested in retail WoW lol

Haha that is not at all why I'm angry, sounds like you haven't been watching the top posts on this sub for the last week or so? The dude is a fucking fake.
---
Awesome
---
He actually played quite a bit on Vanilla. He played some private servers too before the crackdown on those happened. I recall him mentioning on stream that he got his sinew on his hunter and he also remembered a specific spell power trinket from ZG I believe. I didn't really play much Vanilla so I'm potentially wrong but he definitely seemed more knowledgeable than the average random player would be.
---
How do you know how old your account is? I'm pretty sure i started shortly after release but battle.net of course was not around so has no record of it.

**&lt;rockstar&gt;**
---
Alliance NA-PvP
---
Raiding+PvP
---
3-4 night Evenings/Weekends, times TBD
---
**Guild Summary:**
---
The premium non-hardcore WoW experience. This guild is targeted towards stable adults and is designed to fit well with a standard working-person's routine. We want members whose schedule fits so they will want to stay with a balanced community long term. The leadership will strive to be transparent, fair, and do what they can to make our plans and goals a reality.
---
**The Four Tenants:**
---
*1. Enjoy What you do and Who you do it with*: Having fun is more important than enduring the pressure of raiding most nights. We will focus on building a strong, drama-free community of gamers.
---
*2. Excellence at what you do*: Strive to be among the best for the limited time we have
---
*3. Make the most of y(our) time*: We will find creative ways to be efficient, and members will respect the groups' time by being prepared to the extent that is possible. Planning and organizing will carry this very far as long as people meet expectations.
---
*4. Balance*: We will go at our own pace, not raid -too- much, and respect everyone's need to be a responsible adult outside of the game!
---
**Guild Details:**
---
***Main Raids***
---
Everyone will want to experience as much of raiding content as possible. I would like to provide this opportunity to experience what is possible to clear in this type of guild.
---
*Schedule*: Main 40 man scheduled raids will have a 3-4 night per week schedule, based on a survey of the guild's availability a few weeks before the first raid.
---
*Progress*: The key here is to go at our own pace and not compare ourselves to hardcore guilds. As long as progress is made and people work on their characters when they can, we will clear content and possibly all of it, eventually. Content release schedule will be longer-tailed, and raids do not become irrelevant like in other WoW expansions. Progress and Blizzard content plan permitting, officers will create plans to maximize possibility of clearing all content.
---
*Classes*: When it is clear that class choice or performance is becoming a liability, then that will have to be evaluated. Three ret pallies isn't good for a progress boss but may be okay for alt raid, farm raid, etc. Off-nights will be opportunities to include those who play specs that are liabilities on progression.
---
*Alts*: Everyone will be encouraged (not mandatory) to work on an alt character. The personal benefits are farming, tradeskills, diversity, summoning, scouting, PvP etc. This character will enable alt raids and potential raid splits if MC/BWL are clearable early/easily.
---
*Loot council*: DKP systems are fair, but are easy to abuse without additional rules. A council system will generally give drops to characters that would benefit the long-term position of the guild in scheduled raids. A calibrated executive decision is a straightforward way to go.
---
***PvP***
---
We want grouped PvP to be an optional part of the guild's experience. Groups should be going on a regular basis on off-nights.
---
***Other Activities***
---
Other non-scheduled activities allows members to still have fun with the group but not be required to be online every night.
---
*Alt/farm raids*: If people want to shoot-off an MC clear on an off-tuesday night, this could very well be a reality.
---
*20-mans*: On off-nights to have fun and to gear up new characters.
---
*Social*: Active discord w/ potential to play other games together, post media, chat on your phone at work, etc.
---
**About the Guild Master**
---
Male, mid 30's, married, house, professional. In a past life, veteran of Rank-1 US raid guilds between WotLK and WoD, and took hiatus for real life progress. I want to enjoy WoW again and run a guild that others can enjoy and benefit in a way that others have given me. From my experience in elite raiding guilds and career experiences, I have learned effective and ineffective leadership styles, and how to convert a vision into tangible plans.
---
**Discord**
---
[https://discord.gg/ep83vAJ](https://discord.gg/ep83vAJ)
---
Find an online admin/officer/member and to start a conversation about your interest in the community. We are aggressively recruiting for various levels of involvement: officers, raiders, pvp-er's, and casual players.
---
I would PROBABLY maybe play through Wrath ... except I would want #changes.
---
1. No flying 
---
2. No LFD
---
3. Hard dungeons (wrath got pretty easy)
---
Those are the big ones I can think of. 
---
But I'd rather they just add new content, if they add anything at all. Would be interesting to see what other direction they would take the game...
---
I'm not sure how probable it is that we'll have a "mature" community on any realm, since it's still a game, at the end of the day, and there will be jerks and weirdos everywhere. But overall, I think the most decent communities likely will be on the RP servers, because people will join them mainly either because RP is their thing, or because they believe that an RP server will have a better community.
---
Other random PvE servers will draw people for different reasons, but RP servers seem to me like they always tend to draw a self-selecting crowd that is looking for a better atmosphere, since people tend to *think* they have a better atmosphere, and they go there looking for that (thus creating what they desire).
---
On the other hand . . . Goldshire. So it's not all puppies and rainbows.
---
Anyway the community on every realm will be starting from zero, and it's hard to tell ahead of time exactly how they will grow. But just thinking about what people are going to be looking for when going to different server types, I think the RP servers are a better bet than most for developing a feeling of community that will be . . . unique . . . anyway. It won't be perfect, but it should be at least something that will be great to be a part of.
---
Interesting poll, ty!
---
Was there even another 10 man besides Kara? Gruul's/Magtheridon's were 25 man iirc, and obviously so were SSC, the Eye, BT, and Sunwell. Was ZA a 10 man?
---
Nope, they all suck.  Bows ftw.
---
Yeah, definitely not a fan of new content completely invalidating prior content.
---
This has to be 100% true and no fake vanilla content
---
This mage still has his Auto Attack in the Actionbar
---
We've seen huge layers in Classic beta.  I hope they dont make adjustments before launch and change them into smaller shard sized layers.
---
at some point they decided skilled classes need to juggle some buff or spell
---
i moved around classes for a while and warrior got away without that bs for ages but i think they even have it now
---
i dont consider juggling a buff or cooldown skilled play , when i realised thats what they were doing to classes it sort of ruined it for me. they want players who can keep the buff uptime as high as possible to be the "good" players
---
i find that boring design and it adds to most classes feeling like re skinned versions of the same thing
---
i liked the way classes played in bc and wrath the most , everyone felt op that was my favourite variant of the skills and trees.
---
the only highlight after that is wod maybe when they made prot leveling super fun and viable it became a sort of aoe grinding machine with no down time which was a lot of fun.
---
if im playing a tank or healer i want to be able to do my dailies as that spec and use it all the time, that was the first time i didnt feel gimped for just wanting to play prot all the time. i dont think they ever got there with holy paladin , i love healing and did paladin healing multiple expansions but ive never had a desire to play prot or ret paladin
---
omg! they are literally all asians!!! is this why we get super grindy mechanics in every expansion?
---
BFA is much worse for older PCs even if they have multiple cores. It doesn't make up for the hugely more demanding graphics of BFA.
---
A whole server revolving around a streamer is not a good thing
---
Sounds like you're clueless as to what I'm referring to. I couldn't give two shits about his gameplay. Go watch his first day of streaming for the beta and stop being a fucking snowflake.
---
Everyone gets watered down spells that are the same with different icons and no class is unique anymore! Duh!
---
Not as mad dash as retail but yes, basically over in 20-40 mins.   
---
  Also much more unbalanced, since it's a rush towards enemy general it's all about who can mobilize more in tandem and how quickly, meaning horde gets shafted towards the end with the bridge and all. 
---
  Also means you're never gonna see the ancient/elemental summon, among other vanilla AV things.

I can honestly say that I can't remember the name of my main's weapon in Legion, despite 20+ days played during that expansion. That being said, I don't think I'll ever forget Rhok'delar and Lok'Delar from my time maining hunter in vanilla.
---
The difference is that it was easy to get your class weapon. Yeah, you had to spend time leveling it up, but the barriers and time investment didn't come close to what was required to get special items in vanilla. Legion just gave you the weapon after auto-piloting through a quest chain. Reading the actual quest descriptions wasn't really necessary. 
---
Contrast that with how long it took to complete one of the epic class quests. I spent weeks farming and getting excited for finally completing the whole chain. 
---
tl;dr: I don't remember my class weapon from Legion either, but I still have fond memories of vanilla epic quests
---
You really think hunters and shamans aren’t playable? Wut? Also 4/9? Rogue lock mage priest wart are obviously the best but that’s 5, so which one of those are u assuming aren’t playable?
---
I think the point is there are no druid trainers in goldshire
---
&gt; i think its easily the best content so far to come out of the beta
---
As a 30 year old boomer, I'm so out of touch. I would think the bug reports would be the best content from a beta, not a 100 v 100 battle.
---
You can level 200 characters to level 30 in BfA and do this exact same battle...in exactly the same zone.
---
But that's me. I'm old and trash.
---
That makes sense, I don’t blame him
---
Add-ons that cast spells for you are pretty much cheating in my book, but some people will use whatever means they can to win.
---
Did rogue combo points only reset if you generated a combo point on another target?  As in, you could mouseover blind a different target while not losing your combo points on your current target.  I guess I was under the impression that any action on another target reset the CPs.  I was an awful rogue back then so my point of reference is useless.

Igen ez tényleg így volt!

EU BETA WHEN???
---
Like this? :)
---
Yes :(
---
They will re-release the story that we have seen so far, but they will maintain the game mechanics from classics. E.g., we will end up with BfA 2.0, no dungeon finder, no teleport, and slow levelling. Lvl 119 to 120 will take close to forever.

If i want to pvp on a pve server i can go to westfall and kill stuff until the 60s arrive. Stop gatekeeping people when you have different ways of enjoying the game. Yeah ive had a few days where i couldnt level in STV on nost because hemet was camped i did not mind it. I do prefer to level unhindered and seek out my own pvp when i feel like it though
---
Brian Birmingham's shirts are always so fucking good
---
So...... WPVP: Alliance or Horde? AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Yes I know, but people seem less open to the 2h versions.
---
If you consider PvP to be toxic than we didn’t want you on a PvP server anyway softy
---
Lol come on Asmon was actively recruiting level 15s. I love saying "lok'tar" and all that as much as anyone else but let's not act like much skill goes into this
---
Wasn't there a cinematic if you went into SM with Corrupted Ashbringer?
---
You ugh Sony but Tips is perfectly alright with you? Lol.
---
When he started the stream he said that he had just returned from walking his dog.
---
They are strong men, they liveded
---
Lemme correct this:
---
There is no Feral DPS weapon in the game until Level 29.
---
I’ve been subbed on and off for 14 years, at least 6 months out of each of those years. I don’t have a Beta invite. Yet some people literally believe they are some special being who Blizzard will hail to for subbing randomly around a Beta launch, when they haven’t been subbed to most of the prior content? This shit is sad. The gaming community has become so privileged and spoiled, now it’s seeped into one of the best games to have been created/recreated.
---
my biggest regret was the 4H men. We wiped and wiped and wiped on them for what seemed like a long time. 
---
Felt a bit flat when we finally downed them in the re-newed Naxx in Wrath.
---
Is classic only going to require an active sub to retail WoW? Let's say this is all nostalgia and the fun starts to fade away later down the road. 
---
This still means for a mere 15$ for one month you get to enjoy your childhood nostalgia (Classic was my childhood at least) for a decent amount of time. This for me is worth much much more than 15$ and I'm very happy to experience this again with a more mature mindset.
---
Just like we told everybody over and over... But wait, IT WAS NOSTALGIA, AKA ROSE TINTED GLASSES!!!
---
Just curious where this meme is being toxic about retail?
---
Wowhead is so ridiculously bloated and slow and that almost any alternative is the superior choice. I'm kind of waiting for someone to datamine the alpha server and launch an entirely new site. If the URL structure is the same on wowhead then I'll make it togglable.
---
The quest ID is the same for a quest no matter what language, so technically a native speaker could rewrite the [quest-id file](https://github.com/wickstjo/vanilla-questing/blob/master/public/routes/alliance/quests.json) and I'd tell the engine to translate names if a different language was selected. I'll look into writing a script that extracts all the localized names from a private server database if I run out of things to do (unless someone beats me to it wink wink).
---
Fuck man, it's crazy. It really feels so recent that I would tune into the Co-Optional podcast religiously. I think TB is legitimately one of the only 'celebrity', for lack of a better term, passings that really had an effect on me.
---
Eyes of the Beast counters this point.
---
They had issues implementing this back on live. They had to make it work for Classic. Now that they figured it out, they're adding it back into retail.
---
Horde is generally a safe bet. They tend to have a population advantage on PvP servers while Alliance has it on PvE
---
Disable flash of light, holy light, and rejuvenate for the first 45 seconds of each mob pull too. Hard mode.
---
They're just 30-50min long pug raids that you can't lose, basically.
---
There's 2 different maps and I'm sure if the enemy was 10x stronger, you'd probably need to know what the differences are but they aren't and I don't. You go in with a load of randos, kill your way across the map and it ends. You get a decent piece of gear once a week from it. 
---
Imagine AV but full of NPCs... not in place of players but more as just patrolling Trash mobs and the odd boss, all WAY undertuned.
---
The comparison is off because Warfronts have nothing to do with PVP. They are truly awful, though.
---
Good catch man, though they added a lot of random people to the beta you were one of the good ones that got in.
---
I hope they fix it since im pretty much exclusively going to play warlock.
---
Yeah it's gonna be hard for me to decide if $15 is worth playing for a couple weekdays.
---
I'll probably do it because I'm weak.
---
Game isn't even out yet and Addons are already available. I've said this since day 1 waaaaay back in 2004, if you can't progress in a video game without the assistance of addons/cheats, you suck and I'll want nothing to do with you in-game honestly. I remember my guild well, we strictly had a no addon rule, not sure if everyone followed the rules but I know a lot of us did. It's really not hard to just play the game, learn what it does and then beat it, it's really simple.
---
But some plebs don't EVER want to lose or waste any time learning something new. So in today's games we are flooded with ways to make things easier which in turn results in plebs getting bored faster and when they get bored, they want more content, when devs can't provide more content, they leave, which hurts the game. 
---
Thanks Mr. Deadly boss mods for getting this ready for Classic before the game is even released.
---
I don’t know if this will hold true without /sit Crits procing enrage. I personally think I will go arms for the talent that builds rage every second making dungeons smoother having more rage.
---
I would welcome BC and WotLK back with open arms.
---
i knew hunters would be bugged to shit, really hope they solve this + pets
---
whelp, even with zin rokh slamming is worse than hs spam.
---
There will never be a server that completely revolves around one streamer. And in my opinion it kinda is a good thing actually, because it makes players more engaged in the community and promotes even more faction rivalry. But as I said I understand that this is not true for people who dont want to play on the same servers as streamers. Hope you'll find a server that fits your preferences.
---
It's not about that and you know it. Say what you will about his character and attitude, but it's still a shitty situation to be in. His JOB is to stream, and doing his job means he will have a fucking nightmare in the game and there's realistically nothing he can do about it.
---
If classic goes the way vanilla went then you will still see the less favourable classes and specs in the game/raid as there is a place for them all, each person brings something(be it a buff etc) to the raid. Guilds are going to have to find 40 people to raid, you’re not going to get a k kick back for being a boomkin etc as that class still helps others. I’m hopefully going to go either lock or hunter, I want to be a support class that can help the others, mages, rogues, dps warriors better by me just being there with the buffs that I may bring
---
People were playing private servers while vanilla was still current. Some people just dont want to pay. It will still happen.
---
Outlands shattered nature requires some form of aviation. Wrath too. In my opinion flying in these two expansions would be fine with just removing the LFD tool.
---
Hell even flying through there now at 410% seems slow. (Maybe because it is so empty) It would be hell on the ground.
---
It depends on what updates have come with the stock UI. I heard we're getting the modern raid frames so I might be able to cross Grid off my list. I hear we can move the player/target frames so I can cross that off my list. I might use some kind of filterable info tracker. I don't know yet if I will make it myself or heavily customize WeakAuras.
---
I would agree. I find arms kore enjoyable myself, though I won’t be rolling warrior this time around
---
Lol I got banned from his channel like 3 years for calling him out on his bullshit, think that was when he playing Wildstar and saying it was better than WoW ever was. He's such a child
---
Keep up the good work =)
---
wish we could get Atlas dungeon maps + atlas loot :)
---
When do you stop adding stuff? And what happens to gear? You will end up adding more and more content and you'll be right where WoW is now. I think that is inevitable. 
---
I think, if anything, they need to come up with an alternative progression process, for things that add more character customization but no more character power. I would love hard raids and dungeons that don't award ilvl-increasing loot (i.e. they aren't just hard until you slowly out-gear them but they are always hard). And this would only be after YEARS of Classic.
---
If you really want thunderfury I would go tank warrior.
---
22 here. Played lots of Warcraft 3 growing up and played WoW during BC on my older brothers account. Didn't have my own account until late WotLK in 2010 though.
---
And horde...
---
&gt;I do not want to change anything about gameplays because it will change the game, which we do all not want, but just the numbers and ratios like physical and magical ratios 
---
So you literally say you don't want changes and then say you want changes. You were doomed from the start.
---
Right. It's pretty clear to me that a lot of what he does is just intentional bait and fucking with chat, that's definitely part of his appeal for me as well.
---
&gt; Go watch his first day of streaming
---
This is exactly what I am talking about - somewhere in a marathon gaming session, there is a supposed mis-conception. I guess you and a few other people in this subreddit want to call that out, and the world goes on and thousands of people continue to follow the stream. It's not as big of a deal as people make it seem.
---
In other words, they wont
---
if it also happens on retail spell batching can't be the reason
---
I'm not saying Method players will not bring viewers, they will! What I'm saying is that Method isn't the type of players that have big groups of players following them everywhere they go, like Soda or Asmon and that's the problem here. This ties really well with your first paragraph mate, as soon as Soda or Asmon stop playing (as they've done countless times with their "project 60s" their server will die almost instantly because the sheep will stop playing if they're not playing with their streamers
---
Hard eye roll.
---
i mean content like entertainment
---
yes the testing thats being done is the most important but i dont think that excludes them from having fun
---
in the other thread they were discussing the lack of lag 
---
testing involves anything people do in the game including stuff like this
---
You have an odd fascination with shooting innocent people.
---
So.. when it comes to proof all you have is some random line stating that "mobs seem to be much stronger" okay buddy
---
As a Tauren. Will I be able to ride a Wolf thats not the AV Wolf?  
---
and im guessing I cannot ride a raptor or a Skeletal Horse
---
Going to almost exclusively play with brother during classic, so always 2 person party.
---
Thoughts on Paladin and Mage combo vs Warlock and Mage combo?
---
I mean, some of them are helpful like Orc Fury and Troll whatever it was. You dont NEED them though. If you want absolute Optimal though, then I suppose you should do that route. I'm gonna be a Tauren Hunter no matter what.
---
ZA was 10 man.
---
I'm planning on taking skinning till at least level 40-45. The amount of kill X quests as you level, is ridiculous. You'll skin so many kills, even those of folk without skinning, that you'll be at level 300 skinning while still level 35 (once you can get artisan level). 
---
If you vendor all the leather, skins, hides etc....then it'll soon all add up.  
---
My plan is to skin everything, and hold onto the leather and hides. I'm planning on just vendoring all the grey items as I level. Then when I get to level 40, I'll see where my gold level is sitting and check also how the economy is going and whether its cheaper to just vendor the leather, or stick it on the AH. 
---
Once I have my mount, I plan on changing professions to gathering (herbs) and maybe enchanting or alchemy.
---
I think they're only going to do Straight progression servers. 15 to 18 months is too long for refreshing and resetting. And each player gets to control how quickly they burn out based on how long they choose to play every day. This isn't something blizzard has any responsibility in controlling.
---
I know it's very unlikely to happen but I would want new content that is inline with Vanilla WoW's machanic's. Similar to the way Old School Runescape is run. 
---
While TBC was a good expansion, flying was a very poor decision from a gameplay standpoint.
---
Problem i see with this is. 2 years later wotlk... 2 years later cata and so on until The game becomes trash again. (WOD) they relaunch classic?
---
&gt;	
---
because they know many people fucking hate streamers and the bad effects they have on servers.
---
Can anyone expand upon this? I haven’t played WOW since streaming became a thing
---
That is why Quin69 is great. When he says he is not gonna accept gifts, he means it. 
---
Asmon will break at level 40 if he doesnt have enough gold to buy mount.
---
I think blizzard is closely monitoring the streams. Pretty sure any bug they come across is being noticed by blizzard or reported by other people. It's all recorded data anyway.
---
I remember, at some point, seeing guys running through IF w gigantic sized name text. I just couldn’t remember if the opposite were true
---
Lol this is bullshit. He's on archimonde and log twice a year. Zeratortv, his guild, is dead for a long time.
---
Open your eyes
---
The fact that the game is still played for 14+ years is not enough as prof for  longevity ?
---
its a bit different with FFXIV as where as on wow you have alts to play different classes on there you have one character and you can change job roles outside of dungeons and raids, so you can queue as one role come out and then change job to do a completely different one, and this means you can do the old content for kit for other jobs.
---
you do also get bonus XP for queuing for older content if you are doing a random one and things like currency for highend items, a bit like you used to get valour in wow to buy things.
---
but rewards aside it means you can do the old content that you may enjoy, help people out and not feel like you are just face rolling it all the time
---
No guild will exclude you based on your racial, unless they are a total min/maxer guild, and raid 4 times a week.
---
What really blew my mind watching was with over 100 people battling it out there was almost zero lag. I fight with more than 15 people when I played retail and we all lagged hard.
---
Yeah. I thought about that as typing it ... but didn't feel like getting into it (e.g., "and they would have to change too much to make no flying work").
---
The problem is that flying is such a button-pressing topic for this community (for good reason). I mean, even in retail it gets everyone very angry. The game is just more fun without flying. And it's a reason why Classic will probably never transition to TBC. I'd have to guess any TBC server will be launched separately.
---
Meh just farm cloth for rep
---
I think the general idea behind the concept is that because of vanillas community, streamers that are really small now and nobody notices will gain following from the people on their server (assuming they are decent players and people know their name on server). 
---
So not every server will have massive streamers like Asmon or even  Esfand, but plenty of smaller streamers will grow on their servers which will impact gameplay on the server. To what amount, ive no idea
---
Soda's server absolutely will. And Asmongold if he plays there too. Their communities will just swallow that server up.
---
Worse than garrisons?
---
Sounds lonely dude. Enjoy re-creating BFA.
---
yeah friends power leveled me in vanilla lol
---
i fucking hate questing
---
been thinking about 5 boxing and doing a fuckload of grinding lol it will take twice as long but multiboxing will make me enjoy it 
---
some people love quests im not a huge fan ill find some way to have fun with it
---
It's going to be on you to meet people and search for people to join up with. Every server will have jerk faces and they will also have nice people.
---
How much cloth will that take though? I do also want to have first aid while leveling
---
I mean Paladin and Warlock are completely different classes, can't really compare them. Do you want to be a pure damage caster or a tanky hybrid? Keep in mind you'll generally be expected to heal at 60 as a Paladin...ret and prot are not that great
---
I hopped on this weekend for the first time since WoD and noticed this on my warlock too. I thought it was really strange there was a delay, but hadn't considered it was a bug. I did find it strange though.

# &lt;Quest Failed&gt; [EU] Alliance PVP Guild
---
Quest Failed is a hardcore PVP guild that is looking to recruit the **finest players of the alliance**. We aim to be the top PVP guild on our server by proving ourselves as a formidable force of highly skilled players. While PVP will be at the top of our agenda, **we also look to fill our ranks with raiders and casual players** as it is important to us that we provide a functional and pleasant community for all of our members.
---
Typical weekdays within Quest Failed will usually include:
---
* Raids (We will be using Suicide King DKP in order to provide the most fair distribution of loot)
---
* Contesting world bosses
---
* PVP nights
---
* Social farming nights
---
* Duelling tournaments
---
It doesn't matter if you are a veteran at Vanilla World of Warcraft, or if it is your first time playing. We are accepting people who are looking to dedicate themselves to the game and learn to play at the highest level while also creating a community of friendship.
---
If this sounds like a community that you would like to be a part of, feel free to join our discord server and fill out our short application form so that we can learn a bit more about you.
---
Our dates and times will be decided once we have collected enough data from our members so that we can accommodate as many people as possible.

sorens huntertimers more like
---
Let me say a little more I guess, there’s no mage trainer in darn.  So it will be a pain to level. You are better off leveling to 10ish or so in normal starting areas
---
I have a love/hate relationship with this animation. On the one hand it looks ridiculous like they just sped up the walk animation. On the other hand, it's delightfully goofy and wtf, and makes me laugh.
---
i mean the better option would be playing since vanilla as i started playing in 2006 when AQ dropped on an EU server. on that note i haven't voted as other than yes (eu) and yes (NA) the options are a it pointless
---
Wait I thought it was Soda and Asmon on a server. Asmon hasn’t said he is going pvp yet, as far as I have seen.
---
Then tipsout and Crom are going horde on a server with Asmon and Staysafe. I know Asmon talked about combining the two servers but it’s not confirmed.
---
Not a dumb question at all, after googling and searching this is the first place I've found that is stated and it's only stated by reddit users.
---
Take it from the meme creator. It's NOT aimed at you.
---
You can most certainly get exalted by 40, even as a non human. And ignore the comments below, its not worth it to just "farm cloth". Its a pain in the ass to commit fully to getting exalted by 40, but you will save yourself more time/gold in the long run. I've completed exalted by 40 before on private servers, actually at 38 as a human. Its worth it if you are patient and want it bad enough.
---
Liveplayging is a bigger german wow streamer but he probably wont play classic or will just end on the most toxic server.
---
But they aren't minor, trivial details are they? Filing bug reports for things that are working as intended is worrying,especially when your brand is that you are a "vanilla veteran", people actually listen to this guy, and he doesn't even know what he's talking about, its very annoying. Elitism doesn't even come into it
---
&gt;VuhDo
---
Healers rejoice!
---
At this stage, that’s probably a good idea. I’ve learned everything I wanted to know about classic except the realm list. It’ll be much more exciting to jump back on the wagon in August.
---
Yeh and when they stop playing those realms will be dead
---
The numbers of the asmongold run have been compared with past videos of vanilla. They're correct...
---
I don't know why these two stories touched me as hard as they did. When I played Vanilla I was around 14 years old, and reasonably a little shitty. The community built stereotypes around the gold farmers, and being a Mage I routinely ran into that stereotype. I didn't really treat them... right. You don't really have that mentality as a kid about the desperation to play WoW like an actual job, especially an underpaying job. I'm just glad some of those people did find good friends in such unusual circumstances.  
---
All in all, wonderful stories.
---
The answer is clear! Hunter can use every type of two-handed weapon.

Tired of [r/classicwow](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow) to tell you that you won't get into any raids as a spriest/non-resto shaman/feral etc?
---
Feel free to join us in our adventure to clear the entire of classics raiding challanges while still maintaining our identity!
---
We will raid 2-3 nights a week and won't require too many consumables.
---
Our goal is to clear all PvE content while sticking with whichever classes/specs we have!
---
Everyone is welcome so feel free to PM me for the discord link!
---
I think what SL07H mentioned above is true.  So is you were to kill a boar by yourself and got 10exp.  If you killed the boar with your friend in a group of two, you'd both get 6 exp.
---
love having a class themed map for all my characters
---
You can explain it 101 times, it won't matter, because YOU are the one that doesn't understand it: we don't want changes, and we never have. We liked what we had at 1.12.1, and, while it wasn't perfect, we know what to expect, and we liked what we had. We want to go back to what we know worked. If you want a different game than that, petition Blizzard for a new game that has that stuff. Otherwise, stop trying to hijack our effort, and fuck off.
---
No tbc, no level cap increase. Add new raids, bgs, pvp rewards etc. Based on vanilla concepts. No major overhauls of the game or game world, no major class overhauls.
---
They can add new quests and zones that unlock new raids that have new gear etc. It's not hard to make new fresh content.
---
Having said that. They don't need to rush to do anything, it will be years before people get bored of naxx and world pvp before they want something fresh.
---
&gt; After the three dungeons we went from level 15 to level 20, with several blue items in our bags. The levels didn't feel earned. The blue items didn't feel earned.
---
And it's exactly that way all the way through into LFR at level 120. Unless you are pushing Mythic+, you can face-roll pretty much all the content. So that's what people do. If there's an easy way people will take it.
---
they would be watching it but not all of it, just too much content to watch and make nktes on little things.
---
im sure they watch to pickup any big things like make azeroth great again was called nostalrius for the first day, guessing blizz told them to change that shit
---
So lets say an average of 9 days played to level to 60. Max farming in say DM runs is 50g an hour. So that equals 10800g. Max spec change is 50g. So thats 216 spec changes or if you change spec to raid and change back so 2 spec changes a week that's 108 weeks or 2 years of spec changes you could have farmed rather than leveling a second warrior. Granted that is assuming perfect 50g an hour farming but even at say half that I think its easier to pay for spec changes than level a second warrior.
---
Ahh ok. I vaguely remember how AV was done originally but I do remember the ancients being spawned.
---
Vanilla has world PVP and battlegrounds and that's it.  It will be hard to be a PVP only player in Vanilla, if you hit 60 and only pvp you'll get crushed by people in dungeon blues and raid epics until the honor system comes out and you can get pvp gear.
---
I think the meaning behind it is everyone a "potential" streamer. I don't even have a twitch account but I can set one up and bam, I'm a streamer. Nobody would care, it's not about the small fry. In a way they are right, but then again, this is not what anyone's worried about.
---
Dude Skarm is the finest piece of human out there. He tanked all of classic and makes constant new content. It almost seems like that a webcam changes your quality of content.
---
He just wanted his axe, were you even watching?
---
https://battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html
---
We cannot separate our Nostalgia from our admiration of the design philosophy.
---
When to stop?    
---
I think my argument is for adding "content that meets the design philosophy of classic, and has some unfinished connection to Azeroth.".    
---
There is years of unfinished content.   
---
Yes. No iLvL increase. (Power creep).    
---
Mounts.  
---
Alternate Gear Sets.    
---
Recipes.    
---
Trinkets.     
---
A challenge?     
---
I would do it.    I don't care of the gear wasn't better.    A chance at a 1% drop for a stupid weapon glow enchant would be enough for me :).

 **&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[NA - PvE Server - A\]** is a new two night raiding guild recruiting for WoW Classic.
---
If you are...
---
...looking to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
...T3 BiS minded
---
...seeking a work/play balance
---
...thinking organized vacation rotation is a wonderful idea
---
...and hoping to play with driven, mature, and friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
**About Us:**
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players from Vanilla to Private Server to Retail.  We’ve played many MMOs at all levels of dedication and leadership, and have fondly held onto our Vanilla member berries as some of our most treasured.  To us a major component to having fun in an MMO is efficiency and proper organization.  We seek to be driven but friendly and aim to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together who will establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
**Purpose:**
---
Celestial Born is being built on a foundation of striking a key balance between real life time constraints and completing the Vanilla raid experience.  Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS.  In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner, but will also work to keep the fun and adventurous spirit of Vanilla in everything we do.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended.  In order to achieve this we are requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks.  Please refer to the Charter at [celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) for the napkin math behind this.  We won’t require this rate of play to be sustained beyond the leveling experience.  Our goals are intensive, but we aren’t necessarily intense or strict in nature.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Tuesdays:  6:00 – 10:00 pm. PST
---
Wednesdays:  6:00 – 10:00 p.m. PST
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible.
---
In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing an optional rotating raid attendance schedule.  With a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system will allow all of us to take breaks without guilt, eliminate a standby bench, stave off burn out, and provide a degree of roster protection.
---
**Loot:**
---
Pre-designated loot council (details in website Charter)
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are still recruiting for many positions. It should be noted that if you resonate with us but are unable to commit to our raid program we may be open to recruiting you as as non-raiding member.  Such positions remain  selective and are held to the same member expectations.
---
If you are interested in becoming a part of what we’re building please refer to our website at [celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/)  and read over the Charter.  The Charter will answer many questions that are beyond the scope of this post as well as serve as the best means for you to assess whether we are a good match.
---
Thanks for reading.  May you find your perfect guild!
---
If you were you would understand that they can't block it.
---
Completely agree. I'd maybe check the subreddit (or the Classic Discord which has a direct #game-news section to catch up with things.) once in two weeks or so. Other than that, we gotta let the hype build up instead of depleting it with every day of idly spending our times here.
---
Is that THE sonydigital?
---
The unverified Sonydigital?
---
The highest Realm Royal earner Sonydigital?
---
As much as it ever did, not at all if don't aime for world first
---
Message sent!
---
Me: "Hey we have different ways of having fun and thats okay"
---
You: "sToP GaTeKeEpInG mE"
---
Man you are really projecting your frustrations onto them. They're definitely not saying it to just upset you, they just think that streamers will be spread out and it'll be hard to get away from them. It really isn't a malicious thing, it's just about managing your expectations. Hopefully there are some servers without streamers but in my rush to choose a server and start the game, I doubt I'll be able to dodge them.
---
Terrible idea. Tbc was so bad for wow.
---
30 bucks is a lunch where I live.
---
Guys is this a new pasta?
---
Good response. You'll this debate win for sure.
---
Are you telling that an 18+ elite dealing 19 dmg is okay wih you sure you can keep beliving what you want.
---
Even normal mobs do more dmg.
---
TukUI is out for classic.
---
Engrish has and always will be a wonderful mixture of fascinating, hilarious, adorable, but most of all endearing.
---
Esfand got very popular on his old YouTube vanilla wow streams, and Staysafe was an exceptional speed leveler and raider in GRIZZLY, he also streamer too. Then tips comes out of nowhere without any prior work of building his name and rides on both of their popularity by joining Classicast. I know this sub has a hard on for streamer bashing, and I enjoy a lot of the classic content creators, but Tips is unbearable.
---
I think you should be fine. I plan on playing fury in raids and PvP in arms. I may not respec every single week. But the best gear for PvP is from raids, excluding ranking gear. 
---
Gold farming alt class would be a much better option than two warriors.
---
Holding the skins isnt a bad idea! Even light leather you think?
---
U can't end up on a streamer server if you don't play #mindfuck
---
More and better flightpoints should have been the norm instead
---
You shouldn't bring up retail because it has nothing to do with Classic. Cheers.
---
Separate servers.
---
He hasn't made a YT video in ages. All those videos are other accounts uploading the reaction videos.
---
Depending on your professions, how well you play the AH or where you farm it isn't too bad. You're talking 100g a week, spec to raid, respec to PVP. Totally doable but may not be easy.
---
I would throw this out to you, spec dps warrior and OT in raids. There wouldn't be very much you couldn't do as an OT in a PVP spec for most content. AQ40 and naxx may require more than a PVP spec to OT but most of the rest of the content you'd be fine.
---
I understand that Blizzard made a promise to deliver a product I am interested in, if they fail to do so they will lose me as a customer.
---
So how did you do it? Did you do the wetlands run at lvl 1? Did you end up needing some cloth donations?
---
"this live stream recording is not available"
---
You say that like US minimum wage is a lot of money. (I have no knowledge of Chinese economics or exchange rates or whatever so maybe that's a big deal now)
---
Im a noob, is that true or not?
---
They actually will tho, since you can play with all the people on your server regardless of layer.
---
You should steer brewing at home so you can afford multiple accounts with active subscriptions
---
but if the hour + spent leveling up skinning along the way were to be spent just farming mobs at 38+ instead, you could end up with more gold.
---
Thankyou :)
---
Oh. Regional office. Makes perfect sense, then!
---
&gt; The people who are fighting in a a r a t h i or South Shore Tarren Mill in classic, there is no magical tangible reward for that. 
---
the reward is killing and camping that little gnome mage mother fucker that was ganking you. No better reward than that. Afterwards, you have to exact revenge not only on him but all alliance in the zone.
---
This is actually preposterous.
---
If you farm 10g an hour (which is fairly low), and can level a warrior to 60 in 10 days, you could have used that time to buy over 50 respeccs. Enough for your entire vanilla career.
---
Quest item pre-BiS isn’t a dealbreaker either. That’s an extra ~300 hour investment (levelling and prebis farming) for one or two slots that are never going to lose you a raid spot anyway.
---
Nope, just pointing out the noobs in the room. /pat you on the head, hello little pleb. :)
---
I doubt Asmon will be on a server with almost any other streamer, he's going PvE because he won't be able to play the game with all the viewers ganking him constantly.
---
I think people are overestimating how many "servers" there will actually be. The whole point of layering is so they don't have to ultimately create so many servers.
---
I am assuming he's talking about leveling duos, and YES pally/warlock is one of the best leveling duos. Since Pally/warlock can do quite a bit aoe, healing, pets, etc.
---
**THIS**
---
you can swim from westfall along the shore to menethil harbor
---
The real warfront is back
---
I can already hear the "true" beta testers whining and bitching about the stress testers ruining their experience.
---
Yeah, and we could always just not work, but then how dl we make s living? Not a fan of the streaming subculture, but I think it often gets overlooked these guys do it for a living
---
Did you report in game?
---
You should have no issue. Troll &gt; Tauren=Orc. That may change if you’re going herbalism, or if you plan to pvp. Tauren war stomp has saved me many times. The stun duration is long enough for you to get a chain lightning off, which could mean life or death in pvp.
---
It's better focusing on OG rep anyway since it's the horde capital and rep gives you discounted prices at vendors.
---
Just restarted it, the video had desynced from the audio after running for a few days, should have checked before I made the post
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fSzZ-on7CU
---
I’m not sure why you’re spreading so much disinformation in this thread to be honest. Most of those streamers have already said who they plan to play against/etc. Staysafe and tips have said numerous times they’ll be on a server on opposite factions to balance the server (on which asmon/soda wouldn’t be). Esfand has also stated he won’t be with SSTV anymore and will likely be doing a thing with method or asmon. 
---
It’s fine to dislike streamers/etc., but there’s no need to lie just to try to get your point across.
---
Sure did!
---
Sorry, but his voice is just depressing. I could only muster 1 minute of listening. lol
---
You are right im being a hypocryte. I somehow missed reading your entire first paragraph
---
&gt; I feel sorry for them really, because I do believe they were genuinely looking forward to the idea of Classic, but the reality for streamers is that they won't have the anonymity of being just another adventurer - they'll have everything handed to them and they won't experience the true game.
---
Ok? Or they could just, ya know, NOT stream the game if they dont like the experience.
---
just give me plains striding back, i need no ground mount !
---
I was leveling in Hillsbrad way back when and joined a couple of people PvPing.  The other guys called their high level friends.  Our side called their high level friends.  I was up until 4 am participating in a giant clusterfuck of world PvP, an experience completely unlike anything I'd played before. 
---
It's still one of my fondest WoW memories and it's the night I fell in love with world PvP.  Vanilla world PvP was the best it ever was.
---
dude is insufferable
---
I don’t have a record of the numbers in original vanilla. But the damage numbers are very, very low compared to pserver numbers. I am not saying Blizzard should make any changes that aren’t true to the original. But I will be disappointed by the lower difficulty these numbers create. Kind of a bummer. On the other hand, I guess 2-hand tanking will be a thing at lower gear levels than on pservers, so I guess that will be fun.
---
Obviously the choice is yours. Just don't be one of those people who rolls on a PvP server and then complains about getting ganked. It's part of being on a PvP server. Players will kill you out in the world. Some will camp you, seemingly for no reason other than them being bored. 
---
I spent vanilla up through Cata on a PvP realm for no reason other than a few friends were on the PvP server we played on. Guess what. I created a character on a PvE realm, made new friends, and was much happier. I get to go out and just farm mobs if I want without people annoying me. If I want to PvP, there are battlegrounds.
---
One thing definitely to keep in mind though is that at launch and for quite a bit after, there aren't going to be any battlegrounds. World PvP will be more alive than it ever has been. This will include being camped/ganked, but at the same time, that likely means there will be more players to assist you as well.
---
This information is wrong. I was perfectly able to ride orc wolves on my tauren druid after becoming exalted with OG, in vanilla. I think it was around AQ patch, maybe earlier. But I for sure had to turn in SHITloads of Runecloth to become exalted.
---
I remember winning a roll for this gun and being hyped to use it however a paladin ninja looted it because it "looked cool in his bags"
---
Classic isnt built on the ground up or on the former classic  base. It’s built on the retail base which is where this bug comes from.
---
Actually, last I checked the times they tried to do massive 100+ person raids in BFA it crashed the server shard pretty hard.
---
People on here are stupid lol. “If some of the classes arent useless and barely played, I wont feel like Im in 2004 :((( i even got my mommy to pay for my sub for muh time machine immersion” and then others are like “They are balanced” yet will argue you when you talk about making sure classes are balanced.
---
&gt; Can't speak to the system in Retail, but the Vanilla structure absolutely encourages you to fight. 
---
But it doesn't force you to if you do not want to. It seems in retail people don't want to.
---
&gt; So much game theory goes into an encounter like that, and it is, in my opinion, the quintessential Warcraft experience.
---
(Shrug). I prefer PvE servers, so I respectfully disagree. In my opinion random world PvP is a terrible, unbalanced, pointless game which gets in the way of playing the parts of the game which are actually good. Your mileage may vary.
---
Yes obviously the very clear and obvious bug should not be happening... Beta is beta is beta.
---
I watch them frequently and I haven't heard them say anything about this. If they did, then I just missed it. No need to act like I'm an agenda andy on a malicious smear campaign against streamers. Just want people to know what they're in for.
---
Assuming 10 days played to 60 and but counting time to gear up a second war, that's 240 hours. Conservative estimate on g/hr when farming is 35g. So 8400, or enough for 168 respecs. Respec twice a week and that would last over a year.
---
He could however get power leveled which would change that time drastically. 4 days played is easy if you're carried. Or he could be better than 35g an hour at farming. You can play with the numbers to get an idea of what is possible. 
---
The real reason he should consider two toons is that if he respecs twice a week he has to find time to farm for about 2-3 hours every week just to pay for the respecs, and then farm for his consumables and repairs on top of that which can be more draining than just sinking the time in upfront for an alt. 
---
Personally I wouldn't worry about respecing every time and just stick to one character.
---
Pretty sure it was confirmed by a couple of beta players that you get less rep than in private servers.
---
LOL. A sleep schedule for the first 7 days after release? 
---
Filthy Casual!!!! :D
---
Thanks, just wanted to make sure come launch day that I didn’t download something and I’d have to wait still to play haha.
---
Rep values are a lot lower than private servers. You’re not gonna hit exalted at 40
---
Gonna start without any but most likely will end up using map for coords and atlas for dungeon loot (I really just like browsing it while flying etc)
---
Also threat, DBM and something for bars.
---
What I will never use is a quest addon. I just cant stand the arrows breaking my immersion.
---
The issue is if you balance certain classes for PVE, then they'd be practically unstoppable in PVP. Hunters and druids are admittingly not that great at PVE, but druids especially are a force to be reckoned with in PVP.
---
i wish it scaled with you until say lvl 59 ... sucks to out lvl an area like the badlands but only do 50-75% of the content ... and then having to farm other faction rep doing lvl 1 quests - kill me now
---
Depends on how much you play and your patience for farming. I wouldn't consider 2-4 hours farming just for respecs every week trivial. Not too bad a couple times, but would get old very fast for me. 
---
Then again, you don't have to respec literally *every* week. Do some PvP in your PvE spec for a couple weeks and build up some gold reserves and respec when you really want to focus on it, and you'll be fine.
---
No it was 100% tipsout. You can google it but there was debate if it was sarcasm or not. However he deleted the clips
---
Don't quote me on this but there will likely be a way to "preload" the game before it goes live so you can play at launch :)
---
I did the same. Subbed on my more played account and forgot I had an older one.
---
It’s ok though found a bunch of items that you can’t get anymore maybe they’ll sell...
---
Yes so much wasted time doing this stuff back in the day.
---
At one point i jumped in the hole that leads to the mage tower room  and dropped below the game map then swam all the way up to Undercity just to see if i could do it.
---
I think enh. Enh is an extra totem at least, okayish Nightfall swinger. Arms is just as awful boss DPS that applies a trash debug,  kicking more useful ones.
---
It's your guild carrying you anyway.
---
If you would take the stick out of your ass and read properly again, i never said i am the one who is right.
---
I said its *possible* that Blizzard is wrong and we *might* be the ones remembering correctly.
---
Can’t we start a reddit post or petition to bring back old av ? The nerfed av doesn’t feel like an epic battle at all
---
I'd say yes. I liked the system where a follower could come with you into the game world. But of course they scrapped that in BfA.
---
In a group, the only xp loss / split you'll experience will eb mob kill xp.
---
And so far, the breakdown is following this pretty reliably:
---
||Bonus|XP from 100 xp mob|Split per party member / %|
---
:--|--:|--:|--:|
---
|Solo|0.00%|100|100|
---
|2-man group|10.00%|110|55|
---
|3-man group|16.66%|117|39|
---
|4-man group|30.00%|130|33|
---
|5-man group|40.00%|140|28​|
---
Wow cool. Thnx for the info.
---
Anyone hear of a DKP addon being worked on?  We'll be using DKP and I'm hoping to have a DKP logger to make it easier on my officers.  Something something loot council.
---
I dont know what to tell ya man... Modern Aff has more dots and more complex interactions between them and other talents/traits.
---
Thanks. Some of those sound a little overblown to my untrained eye, but I think it makes a compelling case to avoid streamers
---
Fuck, just hunter pet tank if its gonna be this cake lol
---
I am totally going to do that. Just switch off from everything Classic until the 13th when I'll reserve my character names. I'll take wowhead off my favorites bar and I'll even unsubscribe from r/classicwow.
---
And I'll be doing all that right after I get Beta access ... &lt;refreshes mailbox&gt;
---
Empty wallets though get those like crazy. Fuckers are broke All over azeroth.
---
I’ve got no problem with the improvements to the look of the game, it’s the gameplay and community itself that made classic amazing. If it had an option to use the mechanics and set up of classic with Modern graphics I probably would do it.
---
Thats pretty sad
---
People make mistakes, but Sony is a mistake.
---
I really appreciate these videos and what not, but can we stop glorifying these streamers like we are? This is NOT Asmo vs Sony, this is 100% Horde vs Alliance.  Streamers do not represent their entire faction and it bugs me so much that people act like they do. At the end of the day, streamers are mostly entitled players who think they have the right to get more out of the game than other players. Downvotes will come from that statement, but it's true.
---
The sun never sets on the Warcraft empire

---
As horde though 2 handed is competitive all the way through.
---
If you didnt expect this reaction you havent been on this sub long. I do agree I would love class balance like we had in TBC (keeping pally/shaman on respective sides) and Im sure it will come eventually as I doubt they stay on 1.12 forever. But for the time I just want the game as is.
---
I should have been a bit more clear. I meant inefficient as in their gameplay and skill tends to be hampered by their bad habits. Carrying around bags full of 40 copper trash so they have to throw items out to pick new stuff up, having 3 each of 4 different kinds of generic food, dying to fatigue by trying to afk swim from Wetlands to Southshore, not binding useful abilities,  "tanking" a dungeon by pressing nothing but Cleave. Shit like that.
---
Actually you can't do this on live, the sharding system crashes the game after around 40-50 people are in the same area unless its a world boss / modern area where they have more bandwidth.
---
Modern wow is trash for having fun.
---
Its also not that well rated for casters iirc, as your not going to be low enough for its cost cost to be worth it normally
---
A server stuck in time forever. Sure but surely with blizzards resources they can expand upon classic and make it better keeping The classic feel
---

We both have been playing MMOs since the 90's.  We have real vanilla experience, including raiding in a hardcore progression guild through AQ.  We both have experience either leading or being an officer in raiding guilds.  We aren't interested in founding our own guild, but would be willing to take on officer or advisory positions if needed.
---
Please don't make us fall back to our safety! I don't want to play alliance!
---
I understood it just fine. I agree with you completely though. However the other poster was suggesting adding poll options to make it better..
---
THey didnt have dw in vanilla
---
If it has been around 2 years, then maybe it isn't a bug?
---
[Oof](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=utddDvJ1Rvo)
---
I mean, these posts are people saying the same thing as you are. They all begin with "They said."
---
Its conjecture, not documentation, not data.
---
They may change Classic WoW because things changed after Vanilla - does this make sense? Does the effort to create Classic WoW with intentions to change it make sense?
---
It stays through death
---
Is that even in the game at the start?
---
I'll be using morrowgrain
---
you never know they might throw in dual spec or reduce the cost significantly
---
Bro, let's not waste 75$ / month on subs lol
---
There are games that are very enjoyable to watch on stream. 
---
Of course there are different skilled streamers and generally the most popular ones are the ones that put on a good show and not the ones that are good at the game (altough sometimes they are, Shroud is really good at shooting games he streams for example)
---
Fanboys are annoying sure but again, doesn't affect you what so ever if you are not on a server with a big streamer.
---
People that religiously hate streamers are just as annoying and obnoxious.
---
Someone level with this dude.
---
it was viable only due to Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros. before that it was either ele or resto with resto being pretty tronk
---
That why I'm glad I will most likely play on a German Server. None of that crap here.
---
Long term would be NA, but my guild unfortunately will not play at the same time I will be online at. Please if you do know a group with a similar situation like me do hit me up.
---
Any day an asmon warrior dies is a good day. Upvote.
---
"LFG WANTED: 'Hogger'"
---
Glad you're happy about it! Its not the same as the pserver one, but is similar enough. I tried contacting the creator of the vanilla one and didn't hear back so I decided to make my own.
---
But they cant use those weapons as offhand. Wouldnt 2h stats be greater from 1h?
---
I'd take a female dwarf priest over other races any day.
---
i was thinking about 40 for a while till i did the maths on that rofl
---
got any recs for good classicwow horde streamers?
---
No stress! I get that it’s probably pretty intimidating for most people to think that they’re going in to classic either alone or with a small group of friends to find themselves on a massive server with personalities already established. I just think that aside from the huge streamers like asmon/soda, the rest will be relatively contained to their own guilds. They’ll definitely interact with others in the world (for better or worse), but I don’t see it as them being much different than a guild of pserver players all coming to a server together to stomp around/taking control.
---
That's because for many of us, this is not about hype. We don't care about hype. We are in it for the long haul, to build a robust, engaging community that can persist through expansions.
---
Also, suggesting they will move onto burning Crusade after Classic is just common sense. And don't worry, we're still going to have 18 months to 2 years of experience in classic.
---
They won't even need to stress test :D
---
Depends on what you consider progress. You can certainly make meaningful progress with 2 hours in Classic, it just may not be quantitatively the same as BFA. For instance with preparation, heirlooms and garrison/BFA potions I was able to solo level 91-98 in under 2 hours. That was pretty satisfying progression in the context of BFA's more rapid leveling speed and more expansive level cap. You could level 1-8 in about 2 hours on Classic. It all depends on how you would value the journey from 1-8. How engrossed that content would get you.  
---
Honestly from my example I probably saw 1, maybe 2 players out in the open world of Draenor. I paid them no heed because there was no reason to. They may as well have been NPCs to me. And even if I were to remember their name because we did have a fun interaction out in the open world, I can be assured I'll never organically see them again because of sharding. That's just my personal testimony on the differences. Everyone plays to get different things out of the game.
---
Yeah, because its a PvP server your going to have people with low maturity on both sides. 
---
That guy that complains about wPvP on a PvP server and that lvl 60 rogue guy camping a lvl 20 at the spirit healer for 2h.
---
It’s either a server with streamer fans or a server with elitist nerds who think they’re better than people because those people watch a streamer. I’ll take the former tbh.
---
Right, but I believe you are misunderstanding what Blizzard is doing, and what addon developers are doing, and how much Blizzard interferes with that. They have interfered with Addons, but they did so on a technical level by changing what Addons can do. Blocking this particular Addon's functionality would also disrupt other addons that have lots of useful purposes. I could even imagine it interfering with traditional RP addons.
---
&gt; Do you guys think that the hype for classic will die out after a month or so of release? 
---
It's inevitable. Not even "excellent" games like Smash Bros. Melee manage to keep their hype alive forever. *Times change.*
---
But WoW Classic doesn't need hype. It needs a core community of players, small or big.
---
So a few things to keep in mind - You can't ride a mount outside your race until a later patch. During Vanilla there was a patch that actually added this function - I think it was around the time they added BG's to the game. I don't think this quest line will be available at launch (I'm not in beta..I may be wrong here). 
---
This old thread has some of that info:  
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7eh7ae/mounts\_in\_vanilla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7eh7ae/mounts_in_vanilla/) 
---
Blizzard hasn't really stated how this will work beyond saying that the pre-1.12 system for mounts is staying ie cheap riding skill, expensive mount.
---
47min, started playing in BFA. Jk, 11 days played.
---
Healing spells get a little leeway if a target moves out of range slightly. The target just needs to start at the heal's max range, but can go a little above afterward during the casting time.
---
“Go play a game you dont like because you want to do x content with this class you enjoy”
---
shamans could tank to about lvl 40 i believe but then plate was a thing and they died, shame
---
Addons like this has been possible for 15 years. If you don't understand that then that's on you. If you don't like World of Warcraft then it's absolutely well within your rights to not play it.
---
I went to a newbie zone and stealthed around with an explosive sheep.
---
Yes, I did an analysis of gold/hr from skinning while leveling and overall gold gain from skinning while leveling. I figured you'll get somewhere between 10-20g, but it's hard to narrow it down more than that since it depends a lot on how often you skin, where you level, how much you grind, etc.
---
Light leather will get you like 70s or so probably, medium will get you about 3g, 6-7g for heavy; and by 40 you'll start to see thick leather which is what actually sells for some real money. By 60, I got 20g just on thick leather on one of my characters.
---
Rp pve is ur safest bet, avoid first server too, those are the one big guils go on
---
When you mark up the beta test it's on a curved surface, and the marks seem inconsistent. Could people gather this data in duels on a flat surface. Anyway,  the pvp video you show of the hunter meleeing at distance is easily attributed to lag, I've had the same happen, and also not happen. The DB's you linked all indicate nothing different from the stated 5-8 dead zone. Kasoda also points out the game has forgiveness mechanics to alleviate lag that sometimes lets you melee from further away. I actually don't see any evidence in your post that it's working differently from vanilla.
---
I mean, the game will end anyway. Once the majority of the playerbase has reached 60 and grinded the endgame for a couple years the game has ended.
---
Ur the bomb! 💣
---
Ok ur right. Two extremely engaged communities in opposite factions competing with eachother over resources and pride, that sounds aweful.
---
Again, I get that streamer servers is not for everybody. But tbh the things that are listed as 'bad' about the streamer servers are the same things that are listed as 'good' about vanilla wow.
---
Lag due to many people ~ more alive community.
---
If you gank someone you will get ganked ~ thats called world-pvp.
---
Scarsity of resources ~ thats what forces you to team up.
---
Hard competition ~ we dont want lfr and free epics
---
Etc. etc.
---
Im kinda done with this discussion now, I have one opinion (which is valid) and you have another (which is also valid).
---
ya idk what this guy is talking about, boss mods were a thing back then too.
---
1.12 is the answer to all gameplay questions. I.e. idk about titles being hideable.
---
Don’t want them to nor is that the goal. Once you add or change (even if you keep the classic feel) it’s no longer classic.
---
What does that word imply to you? Classic. Do you think of something old with a little bit of new mixed in? Or go you think of something we’ll... classic?
---
hah i was a rogue back in vanilla as well.  ofc i was a 1337 player ;)
---
yeah addons help and there would be more palas but there are always slackers in raids and you have to pick up their slack or call them out.  our guild is pretty relaxed so we let a little bit of slack go - but unfortunately that leaves people like me to make up the difference hehe
---
I loved being a healer for a couple of months of MC and BWL but i fancy something different this time around.  I'll be able to farm gold and hordies much better &gt;:)
---
I'd pick up LW if you are in it for the money, theyre are multiple patterns that will increase the oney you get per skin by  a large amount.
---
Well that just opens up opportunity for his friend to join on the adventure.
---
The link for IRL is missing. Copy and pasted the one from above it. Fix?
---
I don't know who that guy in the douchebag haircut is but he sure is annoying. Also, nice nickname, Sonydigital, real genious.
---
Sorry for the late reply but if anything the way they are doing it Retail is going to see a slight up-tick when classic comes out since the sub bundles both versions together.
---
I'll probably hop back and forth a bit depending on which one is boring/frustrating me when it comes out.
---
I have no problem with a discord, atleast people will still have to communicate to get the group which will then more than likely lead to more conversation during the run.
---
So obviously I am suspicious as well, and I do agree the aggro radius of mobs seems a bit off and some damage numbers seem low, but at the end of the day until Blizzard comment on it i'm just going to reserve judgement.
---
Island Expeditions say hello
---
Okay, but something is still clearly wrong...
---
Things take a lot longer to accomplish in Classic so while the hype will most certainly die down, each phase should revive interest.
---
I expect you’ll see some people go and try other games after some months and then come back to classic. I expect that after 18-24 months if there isn’t anything “new” that people will start to move on.
---
Some will move on sooner - but in large part I’d give it a 12-24 month “fresh” window.
---
Well and let's not confuse the acronyms. WotLK had an "LFG" but it was primarily for quests and pretty much no one used it. The Dungeon system that WotLK also introduced is now referred to as LFD (to fit with all the new group forming systems) or dungeon finder. It's the queue system, as opposed to the "find a group in a list" system. The addon is closer to the newer LFG system that people actually use, and of course that is subtracting the cross-realm functionality of the retail LFG.
---
I wish there were servers that disallowed addons.
---
&lt;Morrograin Mafia&gt;  NA // PVP // ALIANCE // Casual Raiding   
---
Raid times:  Alternating Tuesday and Monday nights @ 6:30 PDT   (To be clear – this means ONE night per week)   
---
The main thing to note about &lt;Morrowgrain Mafia&gt; is the raid schedule.  The initial group is comprised of people that played classic together many moons ago, most of whom too old to play like we used to, but are also unable to fight against pull of nostalgia.  As such, we'll be raiding one night per week, to keep our wives happy.  To begin with we will alternate between Tuesday to Monday nights.  This way we can run the same raid timer twice without playing twice per week.      
---
We will primarily be a Molten Core and Onyxia guild.  Once we get the raid down to one day (which I don't imagine will take long) we will shift to completing it every week on Tuesdays, rather than every other on staggered days.  We will continue running MC exclusively for longer than most other guilds, a subset of the guild may start attempting new content as it releases, but my primary concern is getting MC on farm.  Once we come to a consensus that MC has little left to offer, we will shift to BWL, and so on.  I don't expect this shift to happen quickly with only one day of raiding per week, but I'm also not in a any particular hurry.   
---
Members will obviously be free to pursue other raid timers during our off weeks, and aid will be readily given to those who want to attempt other content.   
---
As to my qualification for running a Molten Core raiding guild, look further than \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\] – which I had in 2006 – as a rogue.  Needless to say I've run Molten Core once or twice.  The sheer volume of MC runs I have under my belt is also the reason I want to make a strangely MC-centric guild.  I have a lot of fond memories of the instance, I find the idea of going back to it very appealing, as I suspect some of you do as well.   
---
I'd like to keep the loot rules as simple as possible.  No DKP, no loot council, anyone can roll on a piece that is appropriate for them, no one can get more than once piece of gear per raid.  Obviously there will be exceptions... if no one wants a piece, if only a small group can use a piece, etc. I don't foresee much issue dealing with these problems.      
---
The tentative date of our first Onyxia, and hopefully subsequent Molten Core attempt, is October 8th 2019.  I realize that giving only six weeks to level is counter to the whole casual appeal of this guild, if a member needs more time than that it's not a problem.  Many of us, myself included, are going to attack leveling with an unhealthy zeal that will only be able to last so long before divorce becomes imminent.  Our first run may include a few level 58 healers, it may include a few PUGs, these things should not be a source of stress.  We are not going for any records, the learning curve at first will be steep, the important thing is to get in there and start teaching the fights.     
---
One note on the casual nature of this guild: it doesn't mean I'm looking for lazy raiders.  We are casual due to frequency, that doesn't mean you don't have to know your class / at least make an effort on consumables.  Molten Core is not particularly difficult, I would like to get to Ragnaros as quickly as possible.  In order to do this – during the raids – you will need to be focused.  That said, we're pretty easy going.   
---
On that same note, I would like to run this with as close to 40 active raiders as possible.  Seeing as we'll only be raiding once per week – my hope is that the majority of members will be at every raid.  Life is never so straight forward, so I will be recruiting some alternates, but for the most part I'd like to keep the roster tight.   
---
We're all very excited, this should be a lot of fun.  Here's hoping some of you join us in the Molten Core.   
---
PM me if you're interested.    I will start an email list and keep everyone updated.  Because our schedule is so simple, I see no need to make a website, if our members want one I will make one.      
---
Right now we can take any class, if you're unsure of your class at least give me what you're considering.  If you need help deciding, I am a fountain of classic knowledge.  Most notably I still need a main tank – who will be the one raider who gets loot preference and ignores my loot rules I mentioned above.  As such this position is going to require a little more vetting, if you're interested in being main tank make sure to note it in your PM.   
---
Thanks for reading!  See you in Azeroth.
---
Darkshore is the best zone to level in from level 10, so I would recommend finishing that zone. Ashenvale is decent but could be horde infested which can be fun if you want to constantly pvp as well while leveling, although they might outnumber you way too much.
---
Same, but mainly because of me refreshing this sub every hour
---
Lol at this exchange.
---
 \&gt;  RP or PVE servers are definitely going to be more mature and less toxic
---
and then the reply:
---
\&gt;   we didn’t want you on a PvP server anyway softy 
---
Not to say I have a dog in this fight, because I'm just going to roll wherever my friends end up, but you are pretty much demonstrating this guy's point by resorting to name-calling over how he plays a video game...
---
He never said the majority of r/wow members are haters, he just said the demo announcement made a lot of them come out of the woodwork.
---
This is very true. Blizzard offers the medium, how it is consumed is up to the consumer. I‘m going to consume it like a good bottle of whisky, slowly and in steafy doses.
---
Thanks, I’m not looking to get into a min max guild. Looking to find some chill people and just bond. Don’t want to b too much of a burden
---
Hate to break it to you but unless you're a main tank in an established guild, you're not getting thunderfury. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
---
Edit : woh ! I did not expect so much  animosity and agression from this community. You even not argue  something. If I will find the same shit people in gzme than here, I will  definitely not play the game. Shame on you guys !
---
Good, fuck right on off to retail carebear WoW.
---
Bruh you gotta play Dun Morogh and onwards. Dwarf starting zone is so good. It's one of the few places that makes me really feel it. I feel like Kharanos is so cozy and warm compared to the surrounding frozen hills. 
---
It's really great, man.
---
https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html
---
Yeah my goal is to get into a chill guild that’s not looking to min max
---
Hi, /u/omegalulreddit
---
As as alliance,  I didn't even get to try it before my sub ran out. And I wasn't resubbing for another month just to try it either.
---
Ty lol the grind will b real
---
&gt;  i dont even know how to play any of the classes last time i logged into wow
---
How can you not?
---
Press X to generate Y while waiting for Z to proc
---
If Z procs use Z immediately
---
If A is not up, use Y to keep it up
---
When you have enough Y, use B if single target, C if aoe
---
Remember to use D and E buffs on cooldown to maximise dps, but time them with heroism and trinkets.
---
Grats, you get to pull the lever on this week's slot machine. No luck? try next week.
---
I think it would be a good change, with some drawbacks like premades rampaging UnGoro 24/7 and avoiding each other.
---
Ooooo 2 short
---
Even after they merged the AHs, IF was the Alliance capital anyways.  
---
So much so that I didn't even think there were AHs in SW or Darnassus to begin with.
---
Not really more unbalanced. The biggest problem with pre nerf av were the archers especially on the bridge you are talking about. Horde is still at a huge disadvantage but its not nearly as bad pre nerf.
---
Not hating but he seems genuinely autistic to me, I have a very difficult time watching him.
---
Thanks for the replies everyone :)
---
If it's not like it was in Vanilla. It will be fixed, just like everything else
---
Addicts. The lot of us.
---
You get to revered with your starting faction by 60, which starts at friendly iirc. The other factions are slightly behind so I would expect if you are diligent you should be able  to get revered or close to it.
---
&gt; It's going to turn the world into a glorified lobby. Dungeons will feel disconnected from the rest of the world.
---
This got me thinking about all the steps leading up to it, and how a lot of Everquest players thought that instanced dungeons ran counter to the spirit of an MMORPG. One of the reasons WoW was called "an MMO on training wheels" from the hardcore crowd from the very beginning.
---
Y'all are hilarious.
---
no, there will be an abundance of light and medium leather. vendor those asap. not worth the bag space, deposit on AH, and time spent putting on AH.
---
once u get heavy leather and above, you'll have to check the prices of each. i personally wait until rugged leather to sell to toher players. everything else i vendor because of the convenience.
---
It can't snowball, you have to coordinate the placing of the original dot. It's really jank, but can be a ton of damage (it's how most mages will play in a Naxx speedrun). You are completely right that snapshotting is a nonissue 99% of the time
---
Except it was organised and lead by the two different streamers on either side. I get that you hate streamers and all but this was more of a showing of their "audience" versus the others. Idk if you watched or not but you can clearly see Sony, at least, leading his team with callouts. They are both the leaders of the respective factions army. Therefor Asmon VS Sony is correct.
---
And you don't think they could stream some hours and then play some hours? You know they are filthy rich do you?
---
First of all you need all the classes in raiding. Hunters may not top meters but tranq shot is essential. All the healer classes have unique buffs. And priests are not the best healer just the best all round healer. Paladins are a better tank healer in long fights and none can beat shamans in group wide damage healing. Secondly the biggest problem whit class balance is not a numbers game it is a gearing problem. The second problem is a talent design problem where almost all hybrid damage spells leave debuffs. Numbers comes after this. Thirdly any changes you make in pve will have huge ald largely un predictable consequences in pvp, the undertaking of a thing like this is a huge challenge for the dev team this is likely why we had to wait until tbc to get it.
---
i have been keeping my thirst slacked by doing the free 1-20 grind on all the class/race combos i consider for classic
---
Few moments in even the most intense raid can match the feeling of jumping for a boat, right at the edge of your range.
---
By definition, yes hype will die down. Otherwise it wouldn't be called hype. It would be your base level emotion.
---
All things are relative ;)
---
Thanks!  6/25/2006
---
I just re-upped my sub for the first time since legion, hopefully i get a beta invite \*finger crossed\*
---
you'd be surprised, Asmodai (a hearthstone streamer) regularly communicates with his chat and keeps it relatively sane, even with 10k viewers. Most streamers just let it devolve into madness
---
has anyone posted a screen of what beta access looks like? does it just say 'wow classic' in the list of games?
---
Do you realize that the mob XP and especially quest XP you get with 1000 players near you is very low?
---
Anal \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?
---
I prefer them over IE, since you can somewhat AFK in them
---
Don't let facts get in the way of a good Millennial burn
---
Battle masters are in. Xrealm bgs are in.
---
But that's by 60 right? So probably only halfway to revered at 40? So then my dreams of having a saber at 40 might be impossible :(
---
there is no "k" in "murloc"
---
That's actually false, str gives higher AP yes, but not enough to significantly affect your kill speed. At most it helps you kill a mob with 1 less swing once you hit a breakpoint, whereas agi will give you crit % and more often than str will result in 1+ less swing per kill. 
---
That being said, they are so close it's not a big deal
---
They probably can't 100% block the addon without crippling functions for legit ones. However, an addon like that is only useful if it's used by a majority of the players. If only 20% use it you're going to have shit luck finding groups. For several reasons, I don't feel that addon will reach that critical mass of users to become a problem.
---
but the client is based on retail with 1.12 layers on top of it so the thing that allowed wall climbing has been fixed in the core of the client somewhere
---
I'm sure Asmond is, but I don't really have an insight to the mid-small sized streamers and their income. And considering it's not exactly a sustainable career, I don't blame anyone for trying to milk it for as long as they can. 
---
That being said, everyone's free to ignore them, which is what I'm blissfully doing
---
Yep. I totally agree with Gulfos. I'm thinking it'll last all of a Year or so before it starts to taper off. Who knows though, that's quite a while away if that's how it turns out.
---
\&gt; Maybe im spoiled by Retail WoW...Everytime i try to jump back in after WotLK, I last like a month in there before quitting again 
---
No offense to anyone, but pre-BC vanilla WOW is where it was at. Peak. Before gear sets were divided. Before arena(albeit fun, there were certain classes that were super good and others were trash no matter what patch). World pvp was fun and meaningful. Everything wasn't obtained in 20 minutes after some booster special via friend invite or not. Etc. I can't say I miss the 40 man raids though, I wish those were around 20-25 personally... but now in this day and age, a 40man will go smooth other than the schedule conflicts between people who signed up for it.
---
Your hype is your own. Everybody's hype is their own. Trying to quantify what other people feel is an interesting way to spend time
---
Hi, /u/surge9609
---
Honestly I doubt it will be only a few weeks. Even the Classic devs laughed when Tipsout asked about server merges in the future. "Classic is not gonna die down"
---
**FOR THE HORDE!**
---
Tauren Warrior just looks so fucking alpha
---
Even more so with the number of people who were watching for the 100k figure...just check new posts :-D
---
Honestly, would recommend considering Dominoes.
---
It has 95% of the same options and configuration of Bartender and is far more lightweight. Given that it's already in the updated list, I would give it a try.
---
I swapped to Dominoes for BfA and really don't miss Bartender at all.
---
As someone already stated, are you sure you can convince 39 other people to give you first priority?
---
As long as you are not the guild/raid leader or someone really special, why should they give you the first sulfuras?
---
But my guess is,  if the guild wants to progress the hammer is much more efficient on a warrior.
---
So I'd pick arms warrior if all you want is getting sulfuras ASAP.
---
They won't have those according to notes I've read over. Not initially at least.
---
Nobody forced them into this job and It Is not relevant. If your job Is annoying me even if you do that for living you are still annoying me.
---
Don't give anyone any ideas lol Gotta keep it a secret.
---
Was that constant 19 dmg or lowest hit?
---
What about murlocs?
---
Very curious about it myself. I *think* group grinding higher level mobs is better, while questing may be worse (good luck getting the first quest done unless layers are small).
---
Zones seem accessible just too low level to survive
---
Well they made other changes after outrage hopefully they see the community wants the npc heavy shitfest that was original AV.
---
As a Shaman the main issue is whether you are willing to go Resto for raiding. They are the most sought-after healing class on the Horde side, as far as I remember raiding guilds almost always had open spots for Shamans as the demand is usually higher than the supply of dedicated Resto Shamans.
---
Calling out streamers for their BS always results in the same, "I know you hate streamers BUT" response.
---
Sounds like [it's being worked on](https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=25196#p25196), but will take some time. Pretty understandable to be honest. ElvUI is a big addon and it'll take them some time to get features done and most bugs sorted out.
---
Wildstar classic will come out and be the wow killer
---
If you would stop being so insanely offended at the idea of being wrong you'd see I said it's a he said she said game. So again, why would you be the one that is remembering it correctly and the people saying the values are actually correct, are not? Just a gut feeling?
---
Source?
---
More people need to tune in to payo. Hes the perfect example of a vanilla rogue ganker.
---
Hype never lasts. Communities made of individual people who choose to commit and contribute and help, they last. Hype is an annoying private server affectation, because the unspoken word behind hype is dead. So often people operate in a binary State, something is either hype and fresh or it is dead, and that's just setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
So glad 'Ruki is playing Classic.  One of my all time favorite PvPers and it's awesome to see him in his element and having fun.
---
In vanilla, basically addons and macros could do almost anything because of the lack of secure templates.
---
Since this is based on the modern WoW API, addons are already going to be a lot less powerful in many ways. So I think this is mostly just a tradeoff.
---
They will likely have some functionality that did not exist in vanilla, but they will also have a lot more limitations.
---
He didn't say pally / warlock.
---
https://youtu.be/uoZM3QHRHT4?t=54
---
Honestly, those turtles don't hit for much at all.
---
What happens in org stays in org!!! Lol
---
Imo pve servers are a dumbed down version of the game more suited for less mature players
---
30k in the past month alone.
---
250k+ isn’t out of the question before release, should at least be above 200k. 
---
The hype is real.
---
Nice sneak attack on upvotes.
---
Thanks I didn't know and i've updated my original post to reflect that this may be intended.
---
Seeing Asmongold get deleted live on stream is borderline sexually gratifying.
---
To be fair, moving raiding upwards through tiers doesn't really harm raiding in the same way that battlegrounds harm world PvP.
---
It's actually really unusual that Molten Core, the game's introductory 40 man raid, remains relevant through all content in vanilla WoW. This is really only because of Thunderfury and a few items (Onslaught Girdle, Bonereaver's Edge) that were probably a bit too powerful and never saw replacements throughout 3 additional tiers of content.
---
I would say that Molten Core loot (especially after upgrades) was a bit too powerful overall so they couldn't expand their ceiling too far without drastically increasing the power disparity between hardcore and casual players. Not everything about vanilla WoW was perfectly designed.
---
So if a tier was added above Naxxramas that further invalidated Molten Core, that's not really a total loss. Especially in today's environment where there's a much larger percentage of hardcore players than casual players. Thunderfury should always be relevant, and people will still want to gear their alts, so I still don't see post-Naxx content ever completely invalidating MC.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
EU only has to worry about dodging Mn and "APES" anyway. FeelsGood.
---
Nice feedback but I gotta tell ya...
---
You tilted the fuck out of me when you were bubbling Asmongold during that SFK run I watched.
---
...and stayed  in melee range of the aoe silence from the trash nearly wiping from no heals.
---
As a classic tank player, please don’t do this!
---
Yeah, nah for real, you can blast through leveling pretty well by following guides.  
---
This way you get where you wanna be pretty fast while not spending 75 a month.  
---
But i'm with you, leveling is gonna suck big time.
---
Not even min-maxer guilds on pservers would care about the racials for Shamans.
---
Hope you will be slow (or fast) enought to avoid the whole R14 farming if you don't want her to loose interest in the game.
---
My theory is they can't have a pvp version due to server limitations
---
That is true, but it also takes conscious effort.  Skinning is totally brainless, and even if it adds up to a lot of time over the course of 40 levels, it doesn't feel like a commitment you have to make.  Perception is important!
---
Nothing in this image contradicts getting new content after naxx even.
---
"Azeroth as it was" - just add outland then
---
"Experience the game as it was before..." - Even if we get new content after we still get the oppurtunity to do this. Both these things can be true while still getting new content. I know I'm just nitpicking but so are you. Why be so hellbent on not adding anything even if it'd be an improvement?
---
You can tank dungeons as a dps spec
---
World PvP works in this regard because it naturally funnels characters who are leveling up in different factions close into the same zone for really the first time. Its very natural and cool and fun but without an underlying reason to start a shit show it eventually slows down and loses its luster. It pretty much turns into Hell Fire Citadel from live: bored max levels to there to grief, hoping maybe to cause enough ruckus to get you to pull out your main. It's fun, but not fun enough to be recurring.
---
Warmodes biggest failing is how easy it is to opt out, and how shit the rewards are. It's just more convenient to dodge world PvP. And since the game doesn't naturally funnel both factions into one place, the idea just fizzles. That, and flying, when added, makes these types of shit shows harder to pull off, since you have a means of avoidance. Warmodes won't be fixed until at least flying is in, so it's basically DoA.
---
accurate , i more mean im presented with something unlike when i last played as far as class design goes
---
i dont recognise the class im looking at the skill wkins may be mostly the same but yeah whatever i dont really care anymore
---
The High King position is such BS lmao. Why on azeroth would the Night Elves ever agree to that? Draenei might agree because Velen is an easygoing guy, like he doesn't care how the alliance is structured he's kind of a pacifist. Genn Greymane might not complain much because he respected Varian when the position was created. 
---
Idk, I wouldn't mind it so much if it weren't a hereditary position. If after Varian's passing the leaders of the alliance voted on a new high king/queen then that would make more sense. Anduin being high king is just so dumb.
---
Damn would like to see a group of 30s do SM graveyard lol
---
The fact that each class has its unique perks and skills that make every class useful in its own way.
---
Some zones have a minimum level to enter. But as far as the beta is concerned everything is there.
---
As someone that works in banking... This is really sad. People get frauded... Fraudsters buy these and resell to hide illegal profits. I won't be supporting..
---
Hi, /u/greenview1
---
Resubbed and signed up for beta, no invite.
---
2 of my good friends are in the beta. Ever since we got a date, I have 0 interest in playing on private servers. I just want to get into the beta and practice everything I have been doing on private servers.
---
This is just streamers in general as I get older.
---
*Damn kids*
---
Do WE know, What time invites normally happen?
---
Hi, /u/Sydarmx
---
Same, but watching him roll over Asmon at the start of his WW quest yesterday did put a smile on my face though.
---
Yep, already did
---
Don't think it's true, probably you just didn't know the trick.
---
Vanilla pre-BC patch, 1.12 Drums of War, was where WoW was it's most perfect as far as Gameplay/Mechanics. Sure it became way more creative and pretty over the years after that, but the Gameplay/Mechanics just went downhill and were dumbed down too far. Vanilla was just super well done in general, and there was simply so much thought in it along with meaning to everything you found or used.
---
I can't help but agree with you and I look forward to at least trying a single Month of Classic. I figure it'll last maybe 6 months minimum before it tapers off. If all goes well it'll be a year. I wonder though... with possibly no content coming, how it would keep people. /shrug
---
People have compared damage from mobs now with real vanilla videos. Beta numbers are correct Pservers were wrong.  You are going to be disappointed because you were playing a game that had incorrect information on it?
---
Time as a gameplay element in a solo game is dumb, it just serves to pad the game and disrespects the player.
---
Time as a gameplay element in a multiplayer game where you can work together to shrink the timesinks is wonderful. Time means that I have the option to play solo and things just take longer, or if I'm feeling social then I can work together with others to get things done faster. Time as a mechanic in an MMO respects the player by letting them choose how they want to play that day.
---
Surely this is the result of streamers playing on the same server but opposite factions rather than it being classic. It's great either way, but people act like the only reason is "cuz classic"
---
Traveling across the world with an army knowing you're going to fight other people in that same world makes it more fun. More immersive and the walk there makes it that much more fun. You actually need to talk to others to do this as well. No spam queueing where you tele there and back without saying a word.
---
Skin/herbalism into alchemy/herbalism is solid. Enchanting just for that trinket is a large commitment (unless you take another one to get raid and rare enchants and/or use the druid to farm dungeon/rare/Elite mob bop gear to DE into valuable mats.
---
I dont think you need much coin to level. You just need enough to buy your training, be that class training, or profession training.  
---
Everyone and anyone will be either vendoring or AHing their leather and skins early. But holding it could help. You never know. I just think its worth holding past the initial zerg to level. 
---
The economy takes time to grow, and unless you're a speed leveller, you have the luxury to choose to hold or sell straight away. 
---
I plan to  get to 60 as quickly as I can, by questing and grouping. I'm not going to zerg it by grinding mobs in obscure corners, just for xp (if I can help it).  So I plan to hold all my drops and skinning stuff, as well as either herbing/mining (which ever I decide), and then look at where I am at 40 when I need 100g for my mount. If I have amassed 100g, I'll hold the stuff a little longer till the economy is up and running and players have excess gold  who are then power leveling professions.
---
Blood elf DK sounds like the best choice for you.
---
Asmon has literally said he doesn't put on a persona in his live blogs.
---
We have officially run out of quality troll topics.
---
Yes, we all have nightmares in our jobs. That's why I'd never work with my hobbies.
---
He made his choice, and is getting loads of money from it. So yeah, I won't be sorry for him.
---
This is always my dilemma. I truly love two classes. Mage and Hunter. I will only have around 10 hours a week of playtime. After a lot of hard thought, I’ve decided to main an undead mage and alt a tauren hunter.
---
I hope to get a confirmation from Beta as well. Hope they won't nerf druids by nerfing their "gimmicks".
---
Oh, too bad :(
---
&gt;Horde was more organized as well
---
So nothing has changed, I see.
---
I remember the transition to this in WotLK. It has always been a staple of WoW to level an alt when you got bored on your main. However in WotLK, all of a sudden, most people's alts started hitting max level. Like all of them. Suddenly it wasn't just having 1-2 max levels and a bunch of low to mid level heroes in your pool, it was having 100% of your roster at max level. You didn't need to get the tank guildy, the mage guildy, etc. Everyone had most heroes at max level.
---
The experience won't be the same without Reborn UI.
---
Yes they are. A non-starting faction mount at 40 isn’t possible. Sorry mate!
---
Agree. I fully understand your frustration towards those people. They've spent a decade+ shitting on our game preferences, all with Blizzard having their back. Closing threads related to classic/legacy discussions, the wall of no, "you think you do but you don't" etc...   
---
Expect them to come back too anytime anyone posts something even slightly complainy about Classic. Server population, not being able to find a group for something, flight paths, attunements... They'll flame the shit out of all those posts. And they'll likely spend a not insignificant portion of their time in game on Classic antagonizing people. 
---
It's gonna be glorious. They're the trolls for the new age of WoW lol.
---
"I know Nintendo is remaking Ocarina of Time for the Virtual Console, but I hope they add a character selection option -- I really want to play through the game as Yoshi and have them rebalance the items so that they make sense for a dinosaur."
---
To be fair, I haven't played any of the MMORPG's you summed up so I'm gonna take your word for it and you're right about that. But there hasn't been a "WoW killer" in all these years. To me this is kind of worrying since WoW is 15 years old and we have developed a LOT in that time.
---
And I have myself played every expansion since vanilla and in my experience, since Cata, the social aspect has gone way down. Not just since bfa. 
---
I can't argue with you about the RPG elements, they are fine for sure. Great character customisation and plenty of room for role-playing. 
---
The MMO part however is severely lacking since Cata. Like I said, I can't speak for all the other MMO's you listed, but since none of them have "beaten" WoW, I'm assuming they aren't the greatest MMORPG's either.
---
My point: 
---
Vanilla WoW is 15 years old and still the MMORPG'est MMORPG (arguably). We came a long way in technology, knowledge and information, it's incredibly sad that a 15 year old game is still one of the best in it's category.
---
I played a naxx-geared rogue in vanilla and the poster above you speaks true. The only ones that challenged our rogues for dps were mages (whoever got the ignite damage) and our lone fury warrior. They are very competitive although they will generally end up wearing odd pieces of gear like leather and mail until AQ40.
---
Oh you will see the ancient &amp; elemental summon I can guarante that. Only "premades" week-end rush will do the 15-20min alterac.
---
Do we know exact invite times?
---
Have you seen that the drood who is tanking "Axin" is level 59 ???????? [https://youtu.be/uoZM3QHRHT4?t=27](https://youtu.be/uoZM3QHRHT4?t=27)
---
While the level 24 boss put him mid life : [https://youtu.be/uoZM3QHRHT4?t=104](https://youtu.be/uoZM3QHRHT4?t=104)
---
do you have any source that they were nerfed ?
---
Ok, thanks. I wasn’t sure if they had a similar setup as the demo where only the Barrens/Westfall is available.
---
BfA has its own problems born of its structure anyway (said as person relatively new to WoW).
---
Get attacked by an Alliance raid group in Vol'dun? Say something to try to request backup for world pvp in LocalDefense chat? Sure, eventually get a few, but first get 2-4 responses akin to: "turn wm off", "lol you can just turn off wm, stop complaining", etc. Unless you've got a kills quest and a pvp group, the mindset is a bit meh. And I actually enjoyed worldpvp in BfA, that aside. Maybe it's a bit born of meshing PvE and PvP servers? idk
---
and preemptive apology about how toxic it is here
---
people have very different views about classic ans are very vocal about opinions 
---
people may be hardcore neckbeards from 15 years ago or that BFA lft 12 year old.
---
hopefully we can meet somewhere in the middle.and make azeroth great again.
---
Wouldn't alchemy's potions be useless for me when im in a bearform?
---
Or are the flasks worth it?
---
Of the stress test? I wish
---
I doubt most ppl will agree with me on this. But for me one of the biggest mistakes blizz made was removing the talent trees. It was something to look forward to every level. A new point to put in everytime. Maybe a nice little trip back to your class trainer to get new skills. Now you feel nothing when you ding.
---
You have to keep in mind that these people have an endless stream of players giving them gold and items.  They're not going into the instance with greens and even white items like you normally would.   They're almost like twinks going into the instance.
---
i think most people just want to avoid the really BIG streamers more than avoiding streamers in particular. There will be tiny streamers everywhere (myself included lul), but most wont be big enough to cause that locust like swarming of players that asmongold seems to create
---
This was my main thought when asking about dungeons. 
---
That and maybe some trying SM Library as a real challenge
---
It will 100% be allowed. Just dont use it if you are that hell-bent.
---
Who, cares.
---
Addons?! #NOCHANGES /s
---
Enchanting is mandatory for the trinket. Herbalism is nice since you use a lot of different consumables
---
You really think a big streamer would miss streaming Classic (not beta) launch and all the money and exposure that comes with it?
---
When classic wow is more of a battle for Azeroth than Battle for Azeroth
---
&gt;So if a tier was added above Naxxramas that further invalidated Molten Core, that's not really a total loss. 
---
Re-read your post. You described the importance of Molten Core on Classic's endgame. How it maintained it's relevance. This is Classic's authenticity. It's beautiful, and ever since Cataclysm's revamp it will be fully avaliable for players. It's to be respected, and preserved.
---
If they introduce more content, it will change this status. If you are going into Classic WoW, you should expect to see it as similar as possible to the original game. Nothing should be corrected or changed, unless it must - and new content for Classic WoW is literally what got Retail WoW into tBC, WotLK, etc.
---
*One* extra quest-mob giving some boots is enough to make people less willing to farm whatever boots was the right one.
---
Sometimes it feels like each player who wants more content for WoW Classic simply wants their own Personal WoW. Soon we'll need WoW Classic: Classic, because the first Classic changed too much, then the second changed too much too, but the third time is the charm - nevermind learning with history that progressing the game also means leaving some things behind.
---
Unironically calling people plebs for the way they play a video game. Big yikes. Hope you're doing satire.
---
I think you're just looking to stir shit up tbh. Low quality bait post.
---
Performance of the 1.12 client degrades way quicker than the retail one with icreasing players count in your fov. I'm running some benchmarks of retail and hopefully classic beta to folow soon. On retail it looks really good.
---
I was just posting for the turtle's damage against the level 21 druid.
---
i think thats what i was thinking too. Itd be nice if there is a core community that gets settled in there.
---
Way more people play wow than watch streams.   Sure they have a following and those people will play where they play, but they are and always will be a fraction of the player base.   
---
I played on the same server as Soda did, by chance, during Legion and it was fine before he came and it was fine after he left.
---
Wrong. Travel form and mount act differently
---
I think finding the right combination of classes will be essential. like a pet class would be helpful because that's sort of like another (albeit gimped) player and possible taunts is needed. it's definitely something I'll be trying to figure out as I level my shaman.
---
Im not insanely offended, im annoyed at your stupidity. You just straight up accused me of portraying myself as the one who is remembering vanilla correctly... which is wrong.
---
And although i cleared that up with my second comment to you, youre still trying to attack me personally by questioning me as if im stating im the one who knows better.
---
How about you learn to read and stop acting like a complete moron? Now let me repeat myself again.
---
All i presented was the possibility that Blizzard could be wrong in this particular case. Nothing more.
---
So stop harassing me by being a passive-aggressive idiot that is taking things out of context.
---
Have you tried BFA? Every class is exactly the same with the same interrupts it’s perfect for you.
---
but its cuz classic
---
Athene? Not sure about that dude but Asmongold is far more successful
---
Oooo “softy”, 
---
you must feel so tough in a video game. 
---
Thanks for proving my point.

Yeah I specifically added that line because I didn't want to insult some of the great indie developers out there :). You make a good point on indies developing an MMO though. 
---
Let us hope for an indie uprising.
---
Good luck, Blizz will break crap addons like this :D.
---
Arms Warrior is a top-tier PvP spec. Enhancement is trash, but you might end up as a Resto once you realize it.
---
Nah mate it will be eternal
---
What is this question
---
Everyone, remember to report this during the stress test.
---
Why do peoppe create addons for classic😩
---
Omg when they start talking about classes he says they wanted every class to feel unique and not play like any other class... compare that to today where everything is homogenized, shaman have a polymorph, mages and hunters have a heroism/bloodlust, ect. ect.
---
Apparently lots of people care about their servers not being shit up, yes.

It's not a debate. It never has been. I'm sorry you think it is, because it's always been about #nochanges. Like I said: if you want something different, you're more than welcome to petition Blizzard for a brand new game like that, but this is ours, leave it alone. I know you didn't do anything to help get us to this point, because, if you had, you'd understand why we don't want what you're proposing.
---
I came in here just for this
---
He started building a sizeable youtube channel based on classic WoW content the second it was announced by making a ton of empty clickbait videos. Lots of people dislike him because he lied about having played since vanilla (he started in cata) and he's had a few videos where he states completely incorrect knowledge about the game. He also started his channel before even hitting 60 for the first time on a private server. He is a prime example of a "content" creator who is entirely in it for the money.
---
I understand that it can be hard to picture it, but imagine this: people have differing opinions.
---
No zone in Vanilla has a minimum lvl to enter. There are high lvl mobs but no invisible walls that block entry due to character lvl
---
What i plan on doing is to rolling a character on a server the " Big " streamers will not be on. Because i know some not all will quit the game right after AQ opens and the scarab mount is gone. If/when they do there followers will leave also and make a big impact on the alliance/horde ratio. and the economy will suffer as people will be putting items in the AH for outrageous prices.
---
Can you explain the last phrase pls? Isnt herbalism just grabbing herbs from the ground?
---
Watching asmongold play is like eating flavorless rice cakes for half an hour
---
IDK, I can't stand Athene but like Asmongold (fucking hate that McConnel dude who he talks to though) and I'm pretty sure Asmongold is more successful than Athene, so not really a budget Athene.
---
Had the same feeling watching Joana's stream last night when he jumped on to the lift down to 1k needles. So many times I have just missed it and fell at the same speed it goes down.
---
Sure they do. If the Activision higher-ups find out that there's no lag that's he perfect excuse to downgrade all the servers and save money!
---
"Improvements" and content are literally the difference between Retail and Classic. How is it possible to have them both?
---
You think you don't (want LFR) but you do (want LFR just that you only want it accessible from a third party app so you can still claim that it isn't Blizzard's fault that the game is easy despite the fact that it's really been us all along pushing for and voting with our wallets for QoL)
---
Pretty sure the "You think you want it, but you don't" line is a developer comment regarding people asking for Classic.
---
i dont see why wouldnt have atleast one
---
yeah im not in a huge rush if im in the first 150 - 200 ish on my faction/server thats fine .
---
i want there to be plenty of people to group with and fill raids when i get there
---
except its not hard. It was easy to raid in vanilla. people who don't like the tougher mechanics now go back to classic where bosses had like 4 abilities (check it up)
---
the only thing classic got over retail, is the dmg you do compared to mob health was a lot lower. so shit took longer to die. Mechanically, it was easy as shit. Just look up the mechanics on Kt 40 or c'thun 40.
---
Thanks for all your hard work.
---
We actually finally had a chance to test this on the Beta and it turns out acting like a total sperg might not have been the test idea on your part:

If they remove the auto part it could be very successful. You need the ability to choose who to invite for a number of reasons.

Changing targets at all should reset any combo points, even if you don't interact with the new target. The problem with mouse over macros is you don't actually change targets.
---
You would know really soon after starting there by reading chat. Can always just start on another server then.
---
Hear hear!
---
I feel like I alone account for probably 200,000 of the 15 million pageviews
---
It's not about what's "right" or "okay" or how it "should" be.
---
It's about recreating vanilla. Some parts will be total nonsense, and that's fine, if it was that way back then.
---
If you have evidence, just go ahead and post it, but keep it as constructive as possible.
---
I find it refreshing. As much as people worship and throw money at them, it’s nice to see people who would knock them down a bit. A lot of them need to be humbled.
---
And some nice rng haha
---
No daily waves :-)
---
To some extent I feel so bad for my NA bros. Classic isn’t going to be classic with streamers around. Just imagine gurubashi arena on your server. You don’t even have a chance to win because 1000 dan boys will back up their streamer of choice and let him and his friends collect it. 
---
I just wish eu has many servers untouched. I can’t see myself being on a streamer server. Would kill my experience for sure
---
I turned 30 a month ago. I'll be a literal 30 years old boomer for Classic release. 
---
*sips Monster while investing in ATVI stocks to sell higher after Classic launch*
---
I'm in beta and have been spot testing damage of mobs vs damage I get on a private server. Same race, class, level, armor. 
---
The biggest difference I see is that in the beta some have sightly different attack speeds than the private server. Either a little faster or a little slower which can change the dps a little, but everything is in line. The only few outliers I've found are some that actually hit much harder or faster in the beta. 
---
This rumor that damage is wrong all comes from streamers giving color commentary on day 1 of release. Maybe it's been fixed or maybe they were wrong, but in every case that I've tested or seen someone else test the beta has proven to be correct.
---
I know the Holy/Shadow build they're talking about, I'm pretty sure it's something that developed out of the years of vanilla theorycrafting on private servers. To call it a shadow priest is a real stretch - the gist is that you go full holy and then instead of going in to Disc you put your 20 points into Shadow to get Shadow Weaving so you have soemthing that looks like [this] (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bZcxxcf0VxV0xx0x). In the raid you use rank 1 mind blasts to keep your Shadow weaving stacks up in between healing as normal. It's higher skillcap req on that one priest but allows for more efficiency for the group since you can bring 1 more proper DPS. (another warlock would be appropriate)
---
Thanks for the insight and screw you for the disappointment :(. I haven't played ESO but I was secretly hoping for those players that ESO was more interactive but I guess it's not.
---
There are plenty more MMORPG's out there so I still have hope that some players at least are having fun.
---
ESO just got crossed off that list.
---
Let us create awesome groups and meet great people when Classic launches.
---
If you're a gamblin' man, enh shaman + 2h WF wep is your roll.
---
I tend to play a lot of alts, and I have 120s in BfA of almost every class.  It's remarkable how easy it is between roles (healer, tank, dps) to have almost identical binds due to the homogeneity of spec abilities.  I understand exactly what you mean, and I am very much looking forward to awkward specs, super grinding, and lots of group effort.
---
Can't wait for all these influencers to have their fanboys mass report people.
---
Its also funny how they are playing on PvP servers and crying about stream snipers
---
Having a huge battle is part of testing though. Also there is a absolutely no reason to do this in retail.  Here it actually started out organically. The  hord streamers that Asmon is working on his lvl 30 quest  and went to prevent him. It started out with line 5 horde ambushing him. And than just kept escalating
---
firstly, there's already been improvements so if that's the case it's already too late. Secondly, it can't possibly be that black and white to you that if you change anything it might aswell be retail. What if some new questlines were added that didn't do much more than add some story to zones that have very little. Would that be the worst thing in the world? Would that ruin the game for you?
---
Level a Hunter alt or get two chars. I’ve given up on my first level 60 on a pserver (Shaman) because of this, I was too tryhard not to raid in 0/5/46 but always respecced 30/0/21 for PvP/farming. Bad profession choices also played a huge part though.
---
If you want an example of something extremely successful remaining "classic" while still adding new content look at old-school runescape. The game is more successful than ever due to its constant updates with new content but remains true to the original feeling of the game.
---
I personally hope Blizzard chooses a similar route so that classic can be enjoyed for years to come instead of months.
---
Most def.
---
Once people get past the initial (and current) circlejerk surrounding the obnoxious grindfest vanilla is and hit the hard wall of countless hours of seemingly pointless farming for minor upgrade, combined with most likely inflated econ. and thousands of people trying to do the same thing as you are, they gonna drop the pink goggles and start complaining.
---
Dont get me wrong,i am super hyped for vanilla release and plan to eventually renew my subscription after more than 10 years of hiatus but you gotta be realistic..it's not 2005 anymore and you're not living off your parents money and simpli cant dedicate 10 hours a day to have some kind of progress.
---
That being said, i cant wait for TBC...that's where shits at.

Wish you good luck mate! Btw there will be a stress test in a few days, hope that one will include more people of the general public.
---
Community managers preventing the general player base from being unpleasant on chats. Private servers allow any kind of behavior in the chat most of the time, the amount of crap you can read in 10 seconds in a private server is scary. Mostly disgusting perverts and toxic people. Being able to read the chat and seeing people act like decent human beings is a deal breaker for me.

Is he playing feral? 
---
People say feral is trash in Vanilla, but that's not entirely true.
---
It's DPS isn't great for sure, but man in PvP? They are fantastic.
---
Exactly, I feel like character progression is useless now since it's almost never-ending. You log on each week to do your chores hoping you get a titanforged from the lootbox this week. It's such a damn shame because I remember that awesome feeling of finally getting that one trinket, or finally getting that named epic weapon. I could tell you the names of the epic weapons during Vanilla TBC and wotlk just by looking at them, now they might as well be Waraxe of the monkey/gorilla/eagle etc. or any of the random enchant weapons you get at low lvls.

I don' see a problem with what he's saying, incorrect numbers can make it more fun yes. 
---
I'm not saying Blizzard should do that but it's definitely more fun on overtuned private servers than the current state.
---
You are so lucky for getting a beta invite.
---
The last part hurts :‘(
---
So everybody can play Classic the way they want to, and experience Classic however they want to.
---
It's just a game.
---
yes its very important.  suddenly being disarmed by a mob and having 0 unarmed skill will net you a corpse run.
---
Having grassy plains actually have a high-density of 3D grass is certainly cool. I like the feeling of being in the wilderness, and it feels like my character is actually moving through under-brush (say in Elwynn). 
---
And some say that the increased view distances make the world feel smaller, but I always felt like it made it feel bigger. Like I never see some morning fog in the real world and think "Wow, the world feels so much bigger due to this decreased visibility." As opposed to climbing up a mountain, and seeing things for miles.

Hello my Classic dudes, we are a **friendly casual / progressive** guild focused on providing a medium for our guild members to find others with similar interests. Our Discord features channels to help find groups for PvP, PvE, Dungeons, and Raid content - no matter what you're doing, feel free to give us a shout! 
---
We understand that **we all have lives outside of WoW** \- hence our casual progression. We will be getting to **all content**, but we won't be killing ourselves to get there. Either way, we won't kick you for doing your own thing! Tempest has **no requirements** to join or to stay in, as long as you interact with the community on occasion.  Shoot me a message on Discord if you're interested, or take a look at our guild's server for more information!  
---
As for raiding, it will not be a set weekly schedule. I will get together with our common raiders and find a decent time over the weekend (throughout the week as well, but this is unlikely) in which we can attempt a run. People will then be free to fill in the empty spots. This will always be announced at least a few days in advance.

It's also 15 years later. 15 years of technology advancement. That is not an excuse.
---
Same here. I just have a few on imgur that I used as "proof" when arguing with guild officers about strat/guild relations etc.
---
&gt; What is the point of playing classic wow with: quest helper, healing bot, lfr/lfg and many more? 
---
To help with quests
---
To compartmentalize healing into 1 interface
---
LFR to have a place to post for dungeons/raids
---
LFG won't work
---
For pve not so much..some give you that extra little edge for extreme min/maxing 
---
Pvp is different story and some racials are clearly supreme
---
Not a "meme" spec, but I'm probably going to run something like this 31/5/15 Warrior spec for PvP and tanking 5/10 man dungeons:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BTzNz0DQATAD_BRA
---
It gets most of the goodies you'd want for PvP while still picking up some necessary tanking talents to keep it sufficient for doing it's tanking job in a casual setting.  If I ever join a pug raid as an offtank, Deep Wounds might piss some folks off, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.
---
Ding!
---
So players who want a stable and healthy community are Elitist nerds? Ok...
---
Forb sometimes doesn't display on targets like most debuffs when you're not in combat
---
Willitclassic.com has all the addons working so far if anyone is interested
---
I was worried everyone in Classic would be absolute gods at the game and everything would be perfectly tuned and I would lose my ability to stand out. Turns out the requirement of "half-a-brain" to be a good Vanilla WoW player is harder to reach than I thought.
---
One of my guilds unfinished business holy grails. We had just gotten to C’thun once and killed 1 or 2 Naxxramas bosses when TBC dropped so we never got to finish those.
---
I wonder if 1 time naming only is in too
---
Well as I said, you should be questioning it wildly right now then. I just don't quite get your point of view. Isn't the point to play a good and fun game? Does it really matter if it's exactly the same as it was? I don't want to play classic because I've played it before and it's an exact copy. I wan't to play the best possible version of classic
---
The problem with going with patch notes alone, is that Blizzard (in all of their games) often also includes undocumented changes. How would you ever be able to come up with proof for undocumented server side changes?
---
Blizzard would need to compare old versions against the new one. The question would be whether they would invest the time or whether they even have access to the older server states. Both of which sounds unlikely.
---
But you are right that talents, abilities and itemization might also play a big role in making things easier.
---
On the other hand though that alone would be an argument to buff mob difficulty, since their goal was to recreate the vanilla experience.
---
I'm surprised you can't tell from the first graph when the beta happened.
---
Haha casual dps class with a for sure group spot? I’ll just roll a warlock.
---
It's not true.
---
I am.. Inevitable..
---
Also fair to note: Classic WoW will likely lose some big time streamers to Borderlands 3 coming out two weeks after. Shooter Looters always start with big numbers, and hard to imagine people won't be streaming that and just might not return to Classic WoW.
---
Thanks for keeping up with us. &gt;:)
---
&gt;Bullshit. I feel like they only keep repeating this line to trigger people
---
And from your post, it seems like they are succeeding. 
---
You hate them but you continue to watch their streams. Are you a drama f word or just retarded? Ignore them and move one dude.

This is my favorite gun in the game.  Plus its really rare because it only drops off the warlock epic mount boss in Dire Maul.
---
Layering will be gone at the end of phase 2.
---
That's true, Yeah. The only way anyone would know what they actually planned on doing, or never doing is if we were one of their upper staff. 
---
At the current moment, It doesn't make a lick of sense, no. This might change when players are raid logging naxx, or are full BIS in naxx, the likely thing they'd do is a TBC server, which honestly makes more sense than new post-naxx content. Either way they do it it leads to the same problem. Just, BC at least does a reset on the power scale.
---
Congratulations and thanks for all the work you're putting into the sub!
---
&gt; Anyone out there care to admit that they've refreshed the sub over 100 times?
---
\*sweats nervously*
---
I'd say any attempt at re-launching classic over and over will fail rather quickly. It made sense for people to start over and over in practice for official servers, but the amount of people that will care about being part of the early server experience the third time around they release new classic servers would probably be in the hundreds.
---
Anyone that's just seeking to start over because they want to replay the game can just make an alt instead.
---
There is no way to keep people interested in classic except what they already did back then, keep evolving the game and releasing new content. While there definitely will be a group of players that will resist any forward progress it's just inevitable. One of the core pillars of the game is progression and without evolution there is no progression.

The problem is everyone asked for classic and now that it’s hear want everything changed. If you want classic the way it actually was then Play blizzards version if not stay on private servers.
---
Soda and co have been farming SM Graveyard a fair bit earlier today, so it seems that's accessible
---
Except this isn't retail where you can do your leveling, gathering or grinding for gold in a couple of hours or so and be relevant - then spending the rest of the time pvp/raiding.
---
Everything in classic is much longer. If he leveled off-stream, he wouldn't stream for 3 weeks. If he gathers/farms/grinds offstream for professions or gold, he won't stream the majority of the time either.
---
***The nostalgia is in the rpg.***
---
If you're actually a fan, you wont get bored.  I'll never sub to play retail again.   
---
Nothing about retail is rpg, its hack n slash for kids.
---
I need to look through this.
---
You need to see a shrink. Your jealousy is taking over.
---
There's pretty much something exactly like this called 'vQueue'. It takes messages from all channels your are in and has interface where it groups lfg/lfm messages by dungeons. Super useful, not needing to keep your full focus on chat to see if anyone is looking for people for dungeon, you can just open the addon every 5 minutes and check dungeons you might want to run.
---
So what you're saying is that you'll be sort of relevant after KT...? Any people wonder why guilds don't take dps shamans.
---
No one really knows.
---
The hope would be that the cap then becomes the people they invite to the stress test, hence, everyone who gets invited between now and the stress test has permanent closed beta access.
---
However, most games it's just temporarily access and your invite will expire upon the stress test ending.

Eu still has Kungen if he does come back.

Battle for Azeroth, a theme about fighting in Azeroth with a heavy accent on Horde vs Alliance. One of the core features of the expansion advertisement were Warfronts. The only warfront available for a half a year was happening in Arathi Basin. I see a lot of correlations.
---
Being honored is enough to get 10% discount right? And iirc you won't ge tmore discount when revered/exalted
---
Spaz+zerg?
---
yeah idk what these guys are on about that first warfront was fun as hell.
---
next was the same shit and i just never cared to do another again.
---
Upvote because I will be playing undead warrior too.
---
I don’t hate them, I just take issue with some of their statements. Asmongold is reaching a point where every stream of his is a contest to see how much he can piss off his chat.
---
Can you elaborate? You would only be waiting around at 60 right? And what dungeons are you referencing?
---
Afaik there were 2 waves so far, the original and the second (that Joana and others on this sub have gotten in during)
---
Haven't heard about one since and that type of information is rarely divulged by blizzzl
---
Well that, and their stereotypical Italian accent (apparently) :)
---
I know you can adjust names/nameplates now, but I don't recall if that has always been the case. I know they have made changes to nameplates over the years.
---
Agreed. Just take note on how fast a group will fall apart on retail as well. All players just go right back to where they were, able to do what they were doing. There was no energy to help people or work together as you could just go back to questing, farming, etc for 15 mins before queueing again. All retail dungeons are about getting a 100% success rate in 10 mins or less with no talking and anything outside of that is a "failed group"
---
LFG changed dungeons dramatically beyond just ez assembly of people.
---
Its literally the premise of the entire project.
---
KILL IT WITH FIRE.
---
The best content in any MMO (or game for that matter) is the random shit you do with your friends for not fucking reason other than you find it fun.
---
That demon hunter though
---
Mhh so i’m the only one seeing it as some sort of cheating?
---
Congratz! And thank you so much!
---
As a Hunter, I've lost my shit over this. Reported the bug as well.
---
Kungen is a legend of the past I think, can’t imagine he still has a large following
---
Why would they be?
---
I thought i couldnt use potions while in bearform. During the fight obv. Am i wrong?
---
ElvUi is being made for classic
---
So that means that you don't see the same addons for retail as cheating?
---
I think some of the essences in 8.2 require pvp to acquire (as of now). I am definitely one of those people but if it is good enough, I will do it. Question is, do the players who really like pvp want a bunch of pve only players in there just to grind the essence and complaining the whole way? Seems like a lose-lose to me but I see the point of spreading the rewards out across the content.
---
Everyone was targeting the Tauren who charged first.   By the time they saw him coming they were all frozen in place looking to get out of there or die to the rest of the horde.
---
I don't think it was "dumbed down", a complete rotation pressing a single macro key was already a thing in vanilla, and also there are classes that in pve get to spam 1 or 2 abilities.
---
So you want retail?
---
You people and you're delusions of farming Naxx.
---
Well yes obviously, but why limit us to that when we don't have to? What if we can create the game and then add to it to make it even better? Should we say no to that just because it should be the same?
---
I know he said a while ago that he wasn't going to update it but just confirming it for those who wanted to know. Sad to see it go though, love pfUI.
---
i know who swifty was thats why i gave him the benefit of the doubt but thanks for clearing that up.
---
Thats what i meant when i said they would make a thread of "things that arent bugs" like they did middle of this last week.

Well we had everyday Posts about people recently got invited. Also you saw in streams, a lot of people popping very day in Starting zones.
---
I asume they invite daily, Just 1k prob.
---
It has been confirmed multiple times that /sit crits to rpoc enrage will not work in classic
---
!! Yes, I think classic will die within a year.
---
I dont think so, says US only.
---
And this is why we need high pop servers so shit like that can occur organically.
---
wtf is that
---
Ah, good to know. My bad
---
In the original WoW beta they had a feature like this. You would flag yourself as LFG and then people could reach out to you for dungeon or leveling if needed. They took it out for some reason and instead added the meeting stones.
---
Just clear me, what weapon is BRE?
---
The struggle/reward ratio.
---
If I can level up 20 times in 1 hour, then each time I level up is kind of just a minor stepping stone.  If I can only get like 60% of a level in 1 hour of playing, then that makes hitting the next level an actual meaningful milestone that feels so much more rewarding.
---
If you need DBM for bosses that have like 3 mechanics maybe raiding isn’t for you.
---
...yes? I mean, its the entire point.
---
Classic is 1.12, so it won't use the new system with expensive skill that came in 1.12.1 but it will also not have the restrictions that were removed in 1.2 etc.
---
At least give ZG a shot. It's fun and can be approached by players in top quality 5-man blues. Maybe you will find it too simple for your tastes... maybe you won't.
---
Well cheating the classic wow experience not the game itself
---
No one is talking about addons, man. We're talking about server side data like boss hp, spell interactions, etc.
---
I see [raider.io](https://raider.io) is being planned.  That personally would ruin classic's community as well.  It would just be like retail where everyone just wants you to spam your score or people trying to get carried by higher io'd players.
---
I can test this tonight. Send me a reddit PM in 5 hours if I haven't replied yet.
---
^(You should wait until lvl 10, which is generally the rule of thumb, unless youre really set on getting the human mount as soon as possible. At lvl 10 you'll get your class quest for bear form which you really need for lvling. So just wait until lvl 10, it'll save you from a lot of running a round to get spells)
---
Who said it was cheating? These features are the reason there is no social aspect in WoW anymore.
---
Come on. Anyone who raids with Asmongold is going to be pressured to give him the loot to earn "favor" with him.
---
i want to play classic at instant lvl 60 with T3 and transmaog, accommodate me
---
Questie is basically crippled version of QuestHelper (due to og vanilla's old API) I'm disappointed if they decide to port that instead of QuestHelper which is much better IMO. But I'm fine either way.
---
If you have an NVidia card, the "GeForce Experience" software now comes with recording functionality.  Used to be called Shadowplay but I believe they rebranded it.
---
Either way, it's pretty easy to set up and use!
---
Absolutely no :)
---
The culture has changed a bit too. People get mad if you try to help them now. They have succeeded thus far not knowing what to do so they think anyone trying to help them is just being an asshole to them.
---
It makes you feel less alone, you feel like you're part of a community and learn about the streamer. Plus some streamers are genuinely funny, for example Mizkif has been playing the Beta and making it a hilariously entertaining experience in my opinion.
---
You seem to know more than me idk why ya asked... 
---
Also, new ppl in starting zones is a big factor for beta, they always need new people in there, but at least some of the already-invited population will be starting another character, call it 5 or 10%. 
---
I think more people will continue to get invited but I'm not 100% convinced the beta invites are daily at this point
---
In current I use add-ons, mainly UI add-ons. In classic I'm going no add-ons
---
Their animations are totally different. Look at the kodo sideways and use the harness straps as a reference. The walk animation takes shorter steps, and the run animation moves its limbs totally differently. In the walk, you can see the kodo lean its weight on its shoulders as it pulls itself forward. In the run, it keeps its momentum and can just swing its limbs forward. It's really well animated and realistic.
---
The rhino you linked has a totally different limb arrangement. Its legs are under its body, not off to the sides. The kodo's limbs literally aren't long enough to gallop.
---
I'd follow and watch Bajheera. He didn't play a lot of Vanilla WoW, but IMO is an awesome guy. Humble, gets around 1k~ viewers, into fitness (But isn't a  douchey gym bro, but yeah he does like to work out)
---
A lot of it comes down to how big the world is:
---
Things like flying mounts and a hub with teleporters around the world, combined with dungeon and BG queues joinable from anywhere... just make the world feel really small after a while.  I like the time invested in travel in classic.  Sometimes things happen along the way and change your plans - which is just as much a part of the game as what you had intended to do in the first place.
---
I also love how some of the quests are... less than optomized.  You will find a quest for something halfway around the world, or have that back and forth between the Shimmering Flats and Booty Bay, or just random quest chains most people have never bothered to complete (who remembers summoning Shadra?)  Even if you don't like doing these types of quests, they tie the world together in ways that the current "hub" -&gt; "breadcrumb" -&gt; "hub" system fails to.
---
&gt; You people and your delusions of farming Naxx.
---
It's not my delusions, I'm not going to raid. but later on down the road, people will be there. This isn't a "few months and done." thing. It's many years. 
---
Chinese players were basically full BIS in BC, Thunderfuries where it made sense still, and just all of the BIS gear across dozens of characters per player, But that was because of Wrath needing to be localized properly. Given time, people will be there with Naxx. and then what? I figure it'll just be a crossroad we'll have to pass when we do get to that point.
---
 Personally, for me as a casual player, I don't really care what they do.
---
That doesn’t mean you need to change what’s inside to please every single person.
---
Yeah I watched Joana for a bit, and he is really calm - I actually enjoyed it, it feels relaxing instead of stressing
---
Note that this is **100% speculation on my part with absolutely nothing to back it up.**  That said, were I to hazard a guess, I'd bet for the stress test they flag most, if not all current subscribers to join the beta for the duration of the stress test.
---
Why are they toxic for the game? I'd probably be a lot less interested in Classic if it wasn't for them streaming it and hyping it up.
---
Hi, /u/Lasivian
---
You will get more XP per kill true. But you will die more often and more often than not need to find a group to complete a large amount of quests. The open world is way more deadly that it is on live today.  
---
Also it’s an MMO you’re really not supposed to play it solo. Not that you can’t but the experience will be way more enjoyable leveling as a duo or trio. Any more than that and yes it will slow your XP way down but rolling around as a premade 5 man you won’t have to worry about PvP as much.
---
Yeah /cast Auto Shot works same as spell without the macro. And yeah I can see that auto attack in melee or ranged as being not what blizz wants. but yeah in vanilla there is a macro that does not toggle off auto shot.  
---
/run if not IsAutoRepeatAction(2) then CastSpellByName("Auto Shot") end  
---
It works almost exactly like /startattack. Here's hoping someone sees this.
---
Yes fuck them for providing free entertainment and feeling of community to people.
---
Then don’t play on that server
---
Whoa you mentioned a retail version of another game in your post! This violates Rule #1, better lock this bad boy and make a new one. /s
---
14 years and we didn't get a world first until now??
---
Isn't pfUI basically his attempt to create an ElvUI-like interface for 1.12? ElvUI will almost certainly get a port to classic.
---
God I miss this game.
---
You however will be :) The difference is, in a casual guild you won't be the only burden. Vanilla raids are possible with like 15 people performing well, 25 can be enhs.
---
Man I loved this addon.
---
It's beta
---
In December, while in discord, I said " I don't think i've battled for Azeroth once this expansion."
---
Honestly I’d be down.
---
HoN Announcer.... Now that's something i didn't know i needed till i had it.
---
Bonereaver’s Edge, 2H sword that drops from Ragnaros
---
Speculation: they're going to treat the stress tests like mini launches with the intent of testing layering and other scaling mechanics. 
---
First one, maybe fill up one additional layer. Second one, fill up multiple layers. Third one, full on sort launch with 10k+ players.
---
My expectation is that we'll see a bunch of invites Wednesday.
---
🤞
---
It's so stupid to me to just want to keep it the same because it should be the same? Can't you think further than "they are bringing classic, it has to be the same" but WHY should it be the same?
---
I wouldnt mind if Blizzard banned all addons. I realize people like them and used them in retail vanilla (I did too), but I really hate the idea that if I dont use addons I will be at a disadvantage.
---
This guy mods.
---
Zerg means a force thats only powerful do to its large number of members, meaning the members can be garbage individually but theyll win by sheer man count.
---
Spaz means like, a weirdo? Ive never really seen the word defined, I though everyones heard the word spaz
---
God tier class. Private server meta has evolved to bringing 10-25 warriors on raids.
---
Shroud last night said he will play Classic WoW until the audience dips. He admitted as such. He said yes, he "could" afford to stream a game with less viewers, but he doesn't want to, so he's still just going to flock to whatever is popular/viewers demand.
---
&gt;but from what ive seen is that they are way undertuned. People are just disregarding it as "we were all shit back then and didnt know what to do".
---
Then please do tell oh master of intellect, what exactly are you implying here? Are you now implying that your eye-sight is incorrect? Clearly you're insinuating that you've seen something that the rest of us clearly haven't as you disagree with the values.

---
Gratz!
---
Well pre patch anyways. Yeah that’s common with new people on pservers too.
---
The twitch viewer thing will diminish once this is old news. But sure, people like Asmon and Soda will stick around which will help inflate numbers.
---
Not sure exactly how it is on retail, but at least I don't know of specific streamers in any way affecting realm populations. Only thing I can think of like that (on EU) is a lot of people on Tarren Mill being Method fanboys. But people congregate on other realms with good raiding guilds too, not just on Tarren Mill. It's just a lot easier finding a decent guild that way if you're a raider. 
---
Maybe if like you say a lot of the big streamers will roll on the same realm it could be noticeable. But other than that I think you guys are massively overestimating how much impact streamers will have.
---
"World First"...in a beta test...for a fifteen year old game. When Classic goes live, in three months, and he gets the trinket again, will it be another world first? It's about as dumb, as the one streamer, who keeps putting "world record X broken" in his stream title.
---
Oh I will 100% be raiding in classic, it just won't satisfy the same itch.
---
Yes but the herbs are used in creation of a lot of consumables. You can't just buy them off of the AH, you'd be broke in three days.
---
Sorry about the 14,000,000 page refreshes I’ve done so far this month. I guess I’m just a little excited.
---
Nah it wont.  Blizzard will eventually make refreshed servers, BC, WOTLK, charge you $5 to move on to the next expansion maybe even or something along those lines.  Maybe make seasons like Diablo 2+3 have to see who can do the most in a slotted amount of time.  There will always now be vanilla servers.
---
Yup. I remember in ICC when the gunship dropped the shield (I think that's what it was? Neverending Winter?) I needed and it took like 8 tries and I finally got it, and it was awesome because I knew I had the best piece for that slot. Nowadays, it's just another stepping stone until you finally get the mythic titanforged blah blah with a socket (which likely will never happen.)
---
&gt; its also more dangerous. having a pws up and max inner fire charges helps a ton vs rogues or anyone opening on yo
---
true. pws is must have in rotation in PVP zones :)

---
I will play classic. The goal of classic is to have an authentic experience not to make it the best game they shouldn't change anything
---
Of course it could be made much better with some changes but it's not the point, it's just very disapointing that the correct values are so underwhelming
---
Warmode pvp is better anyway
---
This might be true on smaller streams, but the chat on any large stream is pointless. On the occasions when I do watch streams, I never have the chat open because its unreadable spammy garbage.
---
Playing Arena in Tbc - WotlK - Cata and even MoP I had far more fun than I did in any raid. ( Ulduar was actually pretty darn good ngl.) 
---
PvE tends to be ( in my mind ) the same boring rotation over and over. There's a very 2 digit binary way of describing encounters: Boss mechanics  killing you, and sufficient DPS.  You're basically spamming your own rotations throughout the entire raid while trying to move efficiently. It's rather boring to me because it's pretty much preset what you should do and you can just find a guide online and do any encounter up to mythic without spending much effort.
---
PvP is a darn good PvP game to play, for spectating it's rather shit. In comparison to PvE arena matches and RBG is not a preset cookbook recipe list of what is going to happen. I don't queue up to the same 3 people in 3s every game and they play the exact same way using every spell off CD at  the same time.
---
PvP had more flavour before, and coupling that with less cds that made your burst spike and more utility made matches interesting. Currently the game is pretty darn boring to play and watch because you're slapping people with a wet noodle stick outside your cooldowns. Instead of increasing your outside cd dmg, they're just increasing the uptime which is just baffling to me.
---
&gt; I like PvP. 
---
I just wonder what game would satisfy your PvP need that WoW does not deliver. WoW PvP had great moments and was a lot of fun before most classes became playable on a gameboy advance.
---
You'd go alchemist to make your own elixirs. You're right about actively using potions. Outside of enchanting, no profession gives bears an objective advantage.
---
If they're making a post about it, too much dev time was probably already wasted. :P
---
You done messed up A-a-Ron.
---
I played with Addons in Vanilla.  Let me experience the game how I want
---
Holy fucking shit the mental gymnastics, dude.
---
Great to know! Thank you! :)
---
Around 15k. His recent event peaked at 150k
---
It’s only underwhelming because the people who stole blizzards content gave you the wrong information.
---
PvE: Resto is definitely viable, it’s the most sought-after healing class and very fun to play. Ele is useless in PvE, Enh has a niche but most serious guilds won’t take you and the itemization for the spec is pretty much non-existent.
---
PvP: Ele/Resto hybrid is good with decent gear (acquired via raiding of course), you can be a decent healer with a huge burst potential. Lack of hard CC and oh shit buttons can be a bit of a probem, but that’s what your teammates are for.
---
Cons: pretty slow and hard to level, and you don’t really have any tricks to make farming easier. Respec costs can pile up if you want to use the best spec both in PvE and PvP (you might be able to raid in your PvP spec once your guild has an instance on farm, but it’s far from optimal). And I hope you like keybinds, lots of them.
---
he said when I replied his post, but he edited lmao
---
Was not aware of that.. thank you very much! :)
---
I have set mine up so many times. Ow I can literally set it up in 10 mins 😂
---
Because not everyone wants to take their time getting to 60. Some people have raiding plans, or only have a limited amount of vacation time set up for the release, and so they need to rush to 60 and get "most of the work" out of the way the first week.
---
You are more than welcome to read quests for directions and find the camp with the mobs all you want. Some people enjoy Classic WoW for reasons other than you do.
---
As far as narrative goes, Legion was probably the funnest. The Suramar questline is, in my opinion, the best the game's ever had. Runas the Shamed also has quite possibly the [best delivered dialogue in the game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlbqUtnCWd8) 
---
I think what made Legion's story memorable - and why Classic will be for the same reason - is its simplicity. Blizzard is great at telling big, simple, bombastic stories that allow players to just wander around and get immersed in. In Legion, it was the players adventuring across the Broken Isles fighting demons, vrykul, elves, and all sorts of other types of enemies. There were [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOmRJ-HD5x4) [touching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATg67eE7uL0) [moments,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THSowKTA61Q) but the bulk of its story was a simple fetch-the-McGuffin. This allows players more time to immerse themselves in the world proper and build their own story, and it is why Classic was - and is - so great in that regard. The story is told less through powerful dialogue and character development, and more on context clues. Stepping foot in the throne room of Lordaeron for the first time can be so powerful for so many players because all they need are the context clues. It's an empty room with an empty throne, with a little blood splatter on the floor. By picking up these details and recalling past events from previous games, they will remember what transpired there. The same can be said for stepping foot in Orgrimmar, and seeing how far it came from the founding of Durotar. Or entering Stratholme for the first time and recalling what was once a bustling city.
---
This is, for the same reason, why BfA's narrative fails in many places. Its story isn't one of simple exploration and context clues. It's a complex, heavily character-driven story where your avatar is, more or less, a background character or messenger boy. Instead of experiencing Kul Tiras or Zandalar yourself, you are experiencing it through the eyes of Jaina Proudmore, Princess Talanji, Nathanos Blightcaller, or Taelia Fordragon. A lot of these characters are well written, and others are not. Whether they are or not does not matter, however, because that's not the point of an MMO. The point is to experience everything through your own eyes, and get immersed in the world that you now inhabit. This, for me, is what I'm looking forward to the most. A fresh world to explore without the need to follow a complex narrative.

***\*\****[***One player said in a comment posted in response to the list***](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291779/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list)***, “Yeah people don’t realize the sheer enormity of game system evolution*** *WoW* ***has gone through since release. I’m not the biggest fan of BoA by any stretch, but I’ve played since closed beta vanilla, and I doubt I’ll be going back to classic. Leveling was painful. Experiencing these old systems once was enough.”\*\****
---
Good. We dont need that negativity in our life. Piss off!
---
Is there a video of them saying that?
---
Oh ok. I guess im going enchanting then
---
But if they have to start doing it a lot it'll be way more than just one instance of wasted time.
---
Then what is a spaz zerg guild, and how does it how a server hostage?
---
Addons are optional, no one is forcing you to take it.
---
Sure, play without DBM. If you know the raids, Vanilla raids aren't exactly complex anyways. But if people want the convenience, let them.
---
(And somehow, this sub at times acts like there were no addons for Vanilla WoW..)
---
maybe unpopular opinion but wpvp at this scale isnt very exciting to me? It's mostly spamming aoe and stuff.  little to no coordination 
---
1v1 out in the world...2v2, 2v3, 3v5 etc get me going.  random skirmishes that break out in stv etc and then friends coming to help and the forces slowly growing but never getting massive.
---
Thats not how dev time works at all.

**&lt;Reforged&gt;Alliance | NA-PvP | Hardcore**
---
**INTRODUCTION**
---
Reforged is a guild built specifically for WoW Classic, consisting of very experienced and passionate World of Warcraft raiders, dating back to the beginning.  We are a PVE focused progression guild.  We have a very strong foundation built now.  As recruitment continues, we will ensure people fit in well with our group and goals.  At this point the recruitment processes is going to be much more intensive.  Put in effort to learn as much about your class, BiS, or any plans for leveling etc.  It will be apparent who puts in the effort and who doesn’t.  As the mission statement says, we want our guild to be lean. We will not have a huge roster. So, make yourself competitive!
---
**GOALS**
---
We strongly believe in quality over quantity. Our aim is to keep our guild lean, tight-knit, and most of all, a fun and desirable place to call home. Efficiently completing all raid content that World of Warcraft - Classic has to offer is our main goal. We will build and maintain a strong and consistent raid team that is capable of farming content while maintaining a fun and enjoyable raid atmosphere. When not raiding, expect us to be pushing high-tier PvP ranks through coordinated team battlegrounds and world PvP.

If you don’t like addons don’t use them.. it’s pretty simple
---
In lineage 2 there are no prt bugs...
---
Are you recording everything from lvl 1-60? Going to need a lot of harddrive space.
---
You're right that they can ride Wolves/Kodos, the others have race restrictions.
---
I was seriously hoping there would be a guild with this name.  What time zone are these times listed for?
---
Anyone hear any info about WIM (wow instant messenger)? Completely forgot about this essential mod. Not sure I want to live without it.
---
All time works the same way given the same gravitational dilation.
---
But if you could choose exactly what is in your own personal chocolate box, you wouldn't put in anything you don't like.
---
So you’re here just for the raiding at 60? There are just a limit number of raids.
---
They’re amazing to just read over when you’re relaxing for the art alone, and I think you can buy them for real cheap nowadays too. Definitely worth checking out!
---
That is an exceptionally bad haircut. I know these streamers have been awake grinding for 5 days straight but, damn, this is bad.
---
No? I was just answering his questions? Do you? I'm not sure why your are asking me lol
---
If you can write an addon that gives you these :D
---
fuck that guy, in particular.
---
Obviously the LFR is getting all the flak. But can we talk about cast bar addons? IMO that also takes away from the classic experience and gives players an unfair advantage. Guessing at a cast/cast-time takes knowledge and skill. Torch and pitchforks for both of those, not just LFR!!!!!
---
Did you submit a ticket in game?
---
1. There are so many of them it doesnt matter if they are good or bad at pvp, they will dominate open world pvp.
---
2. They are spaz because they play wow enough in such large numbers that they control a server, not to mention the fact that they want to control a server.
---
Ill expect they shut down retail server, cause everybody gonna play classic.
---
This sub: *"man, guys, I can't wait for the game, the community is so helpful and friendly!"*  
---
Also this sub: *"REEEEEEEEE he doesn't know everything from Vanilla REEeeeEEEEeeeEEEEeEEE"*
---
Jesus, that's pretty scummy sounding dude right there. It's a shame he gained a following based on that. Hopefully his channel will fade out in the wake of actual, quality streams.
---
Do devs work in a different time continuum than the rest of us or?
---
Addons were a huge part of vanilla, and it won't kill it any more now than it did back then.
---
-Plays Horde and doesn't have Berzerker Rage on a keybind:  "Get my fear, get my fear, get my gear, get my fear!"
---
If you find feenix being corrupt to protect their money is hard to believe you never played on pservers besides nostalrius.
---
My hot dream would be getting to play TBC and WotLK again BUT with changes. Rebalancing raids to 20/40men. Removing resilience, no x-realm shit, hard dungeons (especially wotlk), no super massive iLvL creep, no heroic raids (wotlk) but maybe doing hardmodes like ulduar, harder naxx (wotlk), keeping up with classic design philosophies... to name a few
---
Really hope they make a X-Pearl or Z-Pearl addon again. Had that back in the day.
---
This sort of World PVP will never be the same once the real game is released.  The battle that went down yesterday would have had lvl 50s stomping on all the lower lvl people.  The same thing would happen on private servers where some amazing world pvp would break out but would be disrupted by a couple high lvl people who couldn't be dealt with.  It is really  interesting to think of servers that cap on certain lvl caps to see how the meta changes from lvl 20 to 30 to 40 to 50.
---
Well, all the MMORPG's I mentioned are some of the biggest MMORPG, so I think you should at least have played them before playing the industry.
---
&gt;But there hasn't been a "WoW killer" in all these years.  To me this is kind of worrying since WoW is 15 years old and we have developed a LOT in that time.
---
I already touched a bit on the reason for this in my previous comment. WoW is not just an MMORPG. Many WoW players are not really into normal MMORPG's. WoW is by now a thing for it self. One reason is how it has a special place in many peoples heart, both because people grew up with it but also because many people loved Warcraft lore from WC3 (or even the previous games). You have to remember that WoW didn't just come from nothing, it was an established and extremely popular franchise already. Personally I played since vanilla and I still come back to WoW each xpac *despite* not liking modern WoW. I just have a special love for WoW, it is unlike any other game. I'm sure this is how many people feel about the game.
---
The term "WoW killer" doesn't make any sense, because it assumes WoW is just an MMORPG, but it isn't I can guarantee you that if WoW launched today as BfA it would not have the playerbase it does - and it would eventually be bettered by another game. These so called "WoW killers" are in a sense, a different genre. It's like saying Overwatch is a LoL killer - doesn't make sense, they are different things. I know this sounds a bit extreme, but WoW has just become something special.
---
With this in mind, to be a "WoW killer" you essentially have to not make a MMORPG, but a WoW game. You can't make exactly like it, but you can copy a lot of the elements that makes WoW feel like it does. Wildstar did that - the cartoonish graphics, the same humour was present, they took a lot of the elements and the game actually did well by launch, but had many issues with servers and other things unrelated to the actual game that lead to its downfall.
---
So I don't think it is worrying at all, there are many great MMORPG (as I've listed, you just haven't tried them), but they won't be WoW killers because they honestly don't fight for the same market.
---
&gt; it's incredibly sad that a 15 year old game is still one of the best in it's category.
---
It isn't. Quite the opposite, the "real" MMORPG community likes other games than WoW. Actually, from the MMORPG fans (meaning those that really love the MMORPG as a genre) WoW hasn't been a good game for over a decade.
---
But WoW is good at being WoW. This is the special strength, because to better it you have to make a game that is more WoW than... WoW. Especially now with Classic coming you can't even hope to make the old school WoW anymore. And even if you *did* make a "better WoW", it wouldn't kill WoW because people have the memories of WoW, they love the lore, they have nostalgia and they feel at home with the game.
---
So try to look at MMORPG as a genre and WoW as two different things. And if you feel sad about no good MMORPG coming out I'd recommend maybe trying some of the many successful MMORPG that actually are on the market.
---
They probs meant herb associated with alchemy. Or if you have an alchemy buddy you could get pots from them (consumables).

I would say - herb + enchanting. You'll for sure meet an alchemist - and with MotW + heals.. Are you really gonna get a lot from alchemy early? Probably not. Late game tho, alchemy could be on the radar. And since you lvld up herb - you'd be in a good spot to switch I guess. 
---
And, for someone who never played druid, can you use probs in shapeshift? I guess I've never looked in to that.. Definitely would be a game changer.

---
Playing on influencer high pop servers seems like the obvious tbh, so you can scenarios like these
---
I played 1 month of retail this spring and I noticed this as well. It really frustrated me on the warlock. It's probably worse for hunters since Warlocks don't use pets as much during dungeons.
---
Still report it for Classic of course. Software is complex and full of dragons. Maybe this issue is easier to fix on Classic than on retail. It's worth a try especially if we make a lot of noise about it.
---
Warfronts were truly the biggest missed opportunity in the history of WoW systems I think. It could have been amazingly good AND simple. Just use the Wintergrasp formula in old 1-60 territories. How do you fuck that up and somehow make it a pve thing?! I will never understand.
---
This could be true but, I think the way I would handle a beta and the way I would handle live would be different. I will also say I don't fully share your point. Classic wow was a social game. I always played it on easy mode compared to you average neck beard because I am very likable. I didn't have to farm stuff and my guild would funnel me everything I needed because I was "the life" of the raid.
---
Pots*
---
Only addon I plan to use is for quests. Really hope one is ready for launch.
---
Not that they won't stream, they just won't announce the server. People will likely puzzle out which server it is before they decide to announce. By covering some of the things on screen you can make it tougher to find the server, especially since a /who doesn't tell you if it the right guy or a copycat on another server right away.
---
The devs answering/looking at bug reports slash writing up those posts are not the same devs doing other tasks. Dev time gets divided up into tasks. Bug fixes don't take time out of other sections because thats a whole job.
---
Nope. I'll have fun leveling and questing. I just don't want to read every single quest to find some vague direction telling me to go East.
---
Again, the way you enjoy WoW isn't the same as everyone else, and addons don't impact your ability to play WoW how you see fit.
---
*pops champagne bottle*
---
Skinning with herba might be more gold efficient from what ive read. And at 60 might switch to alchemy
---
Man, this is too real.
---
I will probably just record when I am doing something interesting like World PvP
---
Why mental gymnasitics is going on here...
---
Questing mod already is out lol.
---
no ? It's underwhelming because people were expecting the dungeons to be hard regardless of private servers, most people remember having hard time in the original game
---
Your plan is great. Ideally you also want engi, for an extra chicken when you DPS (adds threat too), and *probably* for sappers (not sure if they pop you out of bear, if they do guess they're quite useless).
---
Can also farm the dagger and keep skinning.
---
You will be using multiple potions - it's handy to make them yourself plus it's a solid gold maker. Enchanting would bound you to sit in a capital city and seek customers for rare or raid enchants or running instances or trying to bear-solo some rare/elites for things to DE and like mass make large brilliant shards and other popular items.
---
Can someone explain how this is utilized? I assume it’s a way to time your on next hit abilities to efficiently use rage?
---
Hype intensifies !!
---
You are wrong and bad.
---
Esfand explicitly says on his stream 'I think i played Pservers too much, I cannot remember vanilla'.  And serveral of his friends concur.  One of the guy who agree's was a dev for nost apparently.
---
Because addons existed during Vanilla. Don't like them, don't use them.
---
Wow
---
"I don't want to toot my own horn but I'm going to toot my own horn."
---
You're essentially suggesting there could be an infinite amount of unnecessary bug reports and it wouldn't make a difference.
---
F\*ck... that looks like an amazing time that's what that looks like. I WANT TO PLAY!
---
Such a valuable guide. Even though I'm not doing storm wind it stills gives me a general idea of what itll be like. Thanks a bunch!
---
This picture needs 100% more Omar. He will lead us home.
---
Finally a video without a retarded face on it, thanks
---
as i am unsubbed, i recently foud you can do 1-20 for free (no sub) so i have been going through the early lvls on retail to see which playstyle i prefer of my picks.   
---
yes the game has changed, and so have the classes but the core of the class is still there - eg warriors are melee, hunters are ranged, druids are meh etc
---
Never thought of it that way. I surely do not want to camp a capital city. Thanks for the advice
---
r/wowclassicplus
---
Wow you sure told him /s
---
Yes but that clarification is very important.
---
Hmm. Engi with skinning? I will read about it surely. Thanks man.
---
It's almost like posters are all different people, not a monolith, and we can all be assholes in new and different ways!
---
Asians crush it. There would be more Asians if it wasn't for institutionalized racism. They literally have to be better then everyone else just to get into college in the first place.
---
Just look at DnD. That game is old af, people still play today and it's the big daddy of pretty much all RPGs today
---
You realize most of those got disabled mid vanilla right?  Stop being an idiot.
---
So don't watch it. I'm not a fan of Asmon so I don't watch his streams. It's that simple.
---
He had sound on while doing SFK today I think? I only glimpsed by as I was finishing up work though.
---
Pretty much, it's just a shittier version of ElvUI and ElvUI has been confirmed.
---
Being afraid of Wpvp makes you soft
---
The player base will eventually be thinned out no matter what. In 1-2 years people won’t be still running nazx for the 50th time. If it popular people will either want fresh classic servers or move onto tbc
---
i recently recovered my old account and had it merged inot my current [battle.net](https://battle.net) so i hope to find some goodies... and i have been told soe o fthose feats of strength count retroactively on a merged account so hopefully my bwl kill and aq/naxx clear (not world 1st, not world 100th) count
---
If we assume that they are using interns and younger staff to look at bug reports which is exactly the role young staffers would have it doesnt take away from looking at other reports. There is no amount of stuff we could do IN GOOD FAITH BETA BUG REPORTING to create an influx that breaks their ability to properly manage the reports.
---
You're essentially trying to say that could happen and its just not true.
---
I'm pretty sure Windows 10 even has game recording built in if you press Windows + G while playing a game. 
---
I'll tell you what though, if you think you are going to record everything, you better start stocking up on some terrabyte hard drives.
---
News flash we used addons in classic. Alt tabbing is just as easy as a quest helper. Play how you want but don’t try and ruin other people’s experience.
---
Because it was hard back then.  If you have 15 years to do something it’s not going to be as hard. People didn’t know everything they know now. You know what gear to use now so you have optimal stats. You know to to do quests so you aren’t running the wrong way. You know the best rotations and talents to pick.
---
found these on github, don't like that I can't link to original addon website with willit...
---
 [https://github.com/vashin1/SyncedUI](https://github.com/vashin1/SyncedUI) 
---
Also inlcudes links to other 1.12 addons that probably won't take a lot to get working.  If I had beta I'd test and fix addons for you guys.
---
&gt; Do you think Classic could outnumber Bfa
---
IMO
---
No. BfA/retail caters to a specific type of player. That type of player is very likely not attracted to Classic. And my opinion is that those players outnumber the Classic players by a considerable margin, like 3:1.
---
So my guess for Classic is around 1M players. The number playing BfA will barely budge overall. Those numbers may well increase slightly as people like me sub to play Classic and then pop-in to BfA to run some dailies etc.
---
Folks, here is an example of a confused person
---
Too fat for me.
---
If you want enchanting then start skinning/mining. Stash cloth and mining mats on bank alts. Vendor skins as usual although some could be handy when switching professions.
---
When at 60 or close to it you switch professions. You get enchanting and then temporary tailoring - process all cloth into greens, DE and drop tailoring (you can stick with it for some time to make yourself mooncloth bags or even cloak of warding if it will be available somewhat early). Then you pick engineering and make as much green guns as possible and you drop engi. You end up with lots of mats for enchanting although you likely will need some more here and there. Excess enchanting mats go to AH at zero fee so it's worth to list them as many will be interested in leveling enchanting :) $\_$
---
hate arena 
---
love wsg/ab/av   
---
hate the retail itteration of bgs with sme of the other crap they have added like vehicle combat and shite
---
ah yes thanks for posting the 295295295th video of tips on this sub
---
All of the 'this is too easy' shit is because these entitled shit streamers are so worried about the dungeon they overleveled everyone they ran.
---
Their lowest level was 19 for DM, of course its going to be easy, peope would run it with level 15-17 people.
---
Or you decided to ignore the title but not the next 2 sentences, as theyre the most important even over the title of the post... you pick the sentences you wanted to pick to be "correct" and threw out the ones that didint fit it.
---
There’s literally a post 10 minutes older discussing the exact same thing.
---
I see this is why you can’t handle world PvP, easily flamed
---
I only have a few hours a night to play nowadays, and I don't want to spend all night looking for a tank. This is mostly for level 60, but any dungeon I might want to do. When I had more time, I could spend 2 hours waiting for a tank and then another 3 hours in the instance.
---
They should release both BC and additional classic content
---
Agree 100%. No TBC, do OSRS style.
---
poop bowl
---
pfUI made my life so much better.
---
RIP, thanks for all the hard work shagu &lt;3
---
Sounds like a stupid place to live.
---
Botting and LFG/LFR addons likely won't work at release. Has anyone even confirmed that they work in the Beta?
---
Blizz has said they will be limiting the API to make sure things that don't below in Classic can't be added.
---
Not meme spec but pom pyro was always fun to play
---
Your argument for no tbc is that naxx is too hard, yet you want post naxx content? So the only one holding weight here is a split in demographics, which is a massive shot in the dark seeing as how we don’t have any data on where subs will be at the end of any phases. 
---
I will never understand arguing for less options.
---
I am confused. I'm confused as to what happened to you in your life that made you like this. Also fairly concerned. You ok bruh?
---
Do you really need more players than Nostalrius had anyways? It sounds like you're more afraid.
---
There would atleast be 12k who stick around for Vanilla only content. If people want BC and WOTLK let them have it. You're basically trying to stranglehold people into having no option but just Classic. And for many people, the golden era of WoW is Vanilla through Wrath. Even losing people to BC and Wrath, Classic WoW would have enough to be a functional game like Nostalrius was with just 12k at peak.
---
i mean, I’m not the one acting up and thinking I’m so good at a video game lmaooo.
---
I see a lot of them on the forums but not r/wow. Most of the BFA playerbase just thinks “it’ll be really popular for the first few months then no one will care after awhile.”
---
People played with add-ons in vanilla too my dude.... Damage meters, threat meters, decursive, whisper buffs for pallies, Carbonite for questing... Uhg so many more. This isn't new.
---
Wow. Thanks, i hope i understood it right
---
If only someone told me all I had to do to unlock the class in vanilla was have my rogue take his shirt off and put on a skirt...
---
Why not just mount up? 
---
^^/s
---
The wow community would just vote in all of the features that killed WoW, they basically did that the first time around lol
---
are they gonna release TBC after the phases?
---
The other side of enchanting on your main would be to DE BoP items (and make oils) which would incentivize running instances and maybe some rare/elites (bear can handle some things solo). Also do note that you need enchanting to make the trinket but you don't need it to wear it.
---
Advanced addons will ruin the game, like cast bars and DBM which didn't exist in vanilla, and Blizzard need to take action before it gets out of control.
---
yeah I think this just says they haven't gotten around to making changes to the API yet which is understandable, makes more sense to finish the game then have the API for polish up.
---
Crendor seemed pretty chill from the ~30 minutes I watched last night. He's playing an Orc Hunter.
---
That's like saying dont release classic it's going too thin out BFA
---
Imo if enough people want tbc give it too them just like classic.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCI18qAoKq4
---
Someone with editing skills make the rabbit into a murloc please
---
let me go rephrase my question as i think its being taken wrongfully lol
---
Well, in theory the client controls the stuff like glancing blows and level based modifiers.  We can see this with the rage/mana/energy gen having to be fixed.  
---
They also had to modify many abilities to match the new systems.  Check through classic.wowhead.com to see abilities that were changed in 1.13.  Almost all 'resource' abilities were tweaked, and even other ones like Armor debufs got touched.
---
Mom!!!! More hot pockets!!
---
What about server discord's? Not sure if I see the difference, I haven't looked at the app due to being at work, but its not a bad idea. This won't eliminate those channels, and people will surely end up knowing about it if it becomes the go to.
---
question would be how could you tell... the sub is the same for retail and classic... i guess if there is a sudden surge or something?
---
What do you not understand? Where does your comprehension fall short? 
---
If you sell the people Azeroth as it was, and add a raid, it is no longer Azeroth as it was. Sure, some will appreciate it, some will hate it, but the fact still remains that it is no longer as it was.
---
Yes hunter deadzone did exist in vanilla my buddy on his druid would root me stand 5 feet away and moonfire me to death.
---
it seems Bluepost bascially say, there wasnt any EU Wave yet, but they fixing Permissions for Forum and prob. sent a wave today. At least it sounds like.
---
poop sock
---
Good news, it is coming!
---
i was more referring to classicast
---
Nah. pass.
---
As long as addons dont give advantages on pvp..
---
Everyone: Wow Classic won't be the same because we've all had years to get to know content  
---
Tips: Hold my axe.
---
Ah, so your idea of "winning a discussion" is to be pedantic. 
---
Have fun with that.
---
Which is fine.  But this particular brand of assholery has run it's course.  Like, if you want to be a dickbag, fine, but at least find a creative new way besides *"lol DAE tips bad?!"*
---
Haha cool ! What race? I was the ultimate 1337 one, a troll rogue. Looked good in full BF, thank god for that set. You play EU? And when you say you played on ely, thats an a private server is it? Your guild from there just converting together to classic? That's neat. I've got a number of mates from bk in the day and from legion joining me, should be fun.
---
By that logic all BigWigs / BossMods addons should be banned too. Not everyone knows about those addons and in the end those players might get excluded from dungeons, raids, etc.
---
It is to address what is being said, but I see that we should just ignore what is being said and debate what we wish we said.
---
I believe my first 60 back in the day was something like 24 days.
---
That did include boatload of deadmines runs,i always was fond of that instance :)
---
Ask freely if needed :)
---
may want some glaives as well
---
Isn’t a healing addon an big advantage?
---
The community will just vote for features that will ruin WoW, people bitched and moaned until the dev's put them eventually the first time.
---
Classic is classi, it doesnt need new content.
---
Called merchandising son. This is how you make the butta. Even better when you do it while making people laugh. It was a master stroke by Esfand lol.
---
Now go back several years and you will see retail players posting wall of nos, nostalgia, "you guys who can't move on" and shit like that.
---
Of course the same people from 2 years ago are not in those civil discussion, and why would they now? They lost and they got nothing to say anymore, but they were there and that's why a lot of people are hostile towards the retail fanbase.
---
People are never toxic just for the sake of it. Also your post just reads as a bashing post disguised as a metapost. "Vanilla people are always the first to attack." Yeah right, cuz there can be a "first to attack" in a discussion that was going on for like 5 years with constant back and forths.
---
Hi, /u/kupoteH
---
Classic definitely has a stormwind auction house, even on beta.
---
Breatheeee, in the nose- out of the mouth
---
Downvote all you want but what’s with everyone’s obsession with streamers/youtubers on this sub?
---
watch it it's worth it lmao
---
Its wrong.  You could Swap:  
---
Main Hand  
---
Off Hand  
---
Libram/Ranged  
---
Trinket  
---
In combat.
---
But who decides all that? I liked the 10/25 raid system in TBC, Karazhan was a good starting raid while most other content was 25 man. Zul'aman was a nice addition later on. As epic as 40 man raids are, it's insanely hard collecting 40 people, and most aren't needed.
---
RAINBOW WARRIOR
---
it's brutal
---
for those of us who main hunter or lock, quick responsive pet abilities made it easy to kite and position your pet. these delays are soo annoying when trying to micro position or growl or whatever
---
seriously hope they fix this in time
---
FACT: The big streamers will all be gone by the next WoW Xpac; especially when they get preferential treatment from blizzard in order to promote it.
---
He is right at least for the early game. I know of multiple hearthstone, runescape, and other streamers that are fairly large and will be jumping into classic on launch.
---
I hope to god they prioritize this.
---
You sure its not you fearing? I've tutored a number of fellow warlocks in pvp and this part always confused some. You fear your target, pet stops attacking
---
Yeah I don't envy you mods but thanks for the amazing work you do!
---
The one Classic streamer I really like is Sakaar (aka Ythisens).
---
That name should ring a bell, as he was the one and only CM for Classic before he got laid off, and the Classic community adored him (many still do). So it's pretty self-explanatory that he isn't really going to be someone who's on the toxic side of things.
---
u/pfsonata thank you for making this post - this is amazing to generate awareness and seriously hope Dev's prioritze this near the top of their list
---
I'm well aware that Asian students are disproportionately penalized from AA practices, particularly in STEM fields at high level universities. That being said, this picture was apparently from Blizzard's regional office in Taipei and thus has nothing to do with that.
---
No but you can use a low level alt for that or have your guildies craft for you
---
Semi-Hardcore Priest looking for Guild.
---
NA EST Alliance PvE with some PvP.
---
I can play every night from 10pm till 1am sometimes even later.
---
Mon, Tues, and Wed I work night security so I can be on 11pm till 6am.
---
Looking to do raids and dungeons mostly. Some bgs and world PvP would be good too.
---
After reading the comments ive thought about this
---
Until 60 herbalism and skinning/mining (my gf will play with me and she might want skinning)
---
After 60 give up on skinning/mining and getting alchemy/engineering since enchanting might imply that i afk in a city for selling enchants.
---
Isnt it ok?
---
Something i hate about reddit, people treat the community as one person.
---
Blizz should honestly just re release content from vanilla to wotlk
---
I'm pretty sure that trinket is a Feral tanks BiS. He'd be silly not to get it.
---
You guys are starting to sound a tad salty lol
---
Oh true. Thaaanks
---
Does Boomkin count?
---
I've been using ElvUI for years on retail, but I may try something different for Classic. I kind of want to a highly customizable UI that resembles the default UI aesthetic. Anyone know of any addons that could do that?
---
Ah, so we're using assumptions as facts, gotcha. So again, you're essentially suggesting there could be an infinite amount of unnecessary bug reports and it wouldn't make a difference.
---
so they have to announce how the fuck the stress test is going to work today right?
---
My 3-10 audience members are going to be SO STOKED!! (I'm not in the beta yet, but I'm trying!)
---
They have the staff for it and have told us this is how their bug report system works. You dont want to believe it then by all means.
---
See that’s what I’ve been wanting to know. Like I know it’s not the most efficient but if I was going to do naxx or aq40 I’d probably re roll. But since that isn’t for awhile and sulfuras is available instantly I think that’s what I’d like to go for.
---
protip: nobody used a meeting stone in vanilla
---
Yeah I may end up just recording certain situations like World PvP, etc. Not sure yet though. Thank you for your help! :)
---
Windows 10 gamebar just hit record before you start each session.
---
hes not
---
Great Content. Stuff like this makes the game shine even more. I am not in the beta but I feel like I just read a newspaper about the battle. For the Horde......maybe
---
But if my memory servers me, it wasn't fixed until TBC when beast mastery became God mode.
---
 [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/)
---
I personally used the Jon St. John one. But they were all sick.
---
O ok, thanks
---
well there is a stress test on tuesday or wensday they have to at least be talking about that in some form
---
That's what I've been saying from the begining
---
Overtuned  numbers would have made it more fun and more of the original experience, even if incorrect
---
That's why I said  that the correct numbers are disapointing, it would have been great if the correct numbers still were an actual challenge
---
Nah, small streamers leech off of big streamers
---
This post is amazing lol
---
Lirik is first and foremost a variety streamer. For a couple weeks he will play lots of classic but then move onto other things that his viewers will like. I don’t think he will be much of an issue. I do worry about Asmon and Soda.
---
I posted this in another thread, this addon is just a troll.
---
 It's pretty much just a direct fork of a BfA addon with no changes aside from references to the addon name. For example https://www.diffchecker.com/qZxY2wQT
---
Stop watching them.  Stop posting their clips here.  IGNORE THEM.
---
Who told you i want post-naxx content? Don't want your bullshit mob rule. Also OSRS isn't roses either, many disagree with the changes and many want "true vanilla" OSRS.
---
Cries about community split, but wants to force me to play OSRS like game. Good luck.
---
Not everyone is celebrity obsessed, these guys let their e-fame get to their heads if they think the greater majority of players give a shit about them.

Welcome to &lt;Trinkets on Trash&gt;.
---
&lt;Trinkets on Trash&gt; is a guild where no player is left behind. Focused on building the character, skill, and passion of its members, &lt;Trinkets on Trash&gt; prides itself on its community and the players that compose it. We are highly dedicated individuals -- currently 81 strong -- and are looking for more players that share our desire to succeed as we head into the summer anticipating Classic’s launch. 
---
At &lt;Trinkets on Trash&gt;, we understand that many of you have real-life responsibilities that keeps you from playing World of Warcraft like you used to. Despite this, we make it our mission statement to complete raids on a progression basis in a timely manner. We are seeking players -- new or veteran -- that have a strong devotion to learn or teach. As an inclusive guild, we welcome players from all walks of life and skill level provided that they are passionate about furthering their knowledge about Classic.
---
If you think that &lt;Trinkets on Trash&gt; sounds like what you’re looking for, refer to the discord contacts at the top of the post. We look forward to seeing you in game. See our FAQ section below for more information.
---
FAQ
---
Q: I want to play a spec which is generally considered non-viable. Can I do so here?
---
A: To a point, we permit the use of specs that are generally considered non-viable in a raid setting. However, if you choose to do so, be prepared to go above and beyond in order to pull your weight. Do your research. Farm the mats. Perform and show us why you’re the best at what you do. Non-viable specs may be phased out during or after Ahn’Qiraj depending on the performance and dedication of the player.
---
Q: Six hours a week sounds like a long time. Is this representative of what is expected each week through Classic?	
---
A: No. Pre-C’thun, it is highly unlikely that we will use all of our scheduled raid time. Players will have plenty of time to do as they wish. We seek players who are willing to learn encounters and perform to the best of their ability, meaning that we will finish in a timely matter each night aside from late-game progression.
---
Q: I want to take my time to level and experience the game to its fullest. Is this going to be an issue?
---
A: No. &lt;Trinkets on Trash&gt; is entirely disinterested in Molten Core server first progression. Players will have plenty of time to level on their own terms and experience the game in the way they wish. This guild becomes a hardcore environment in Phase 5 with the launch of AQ and will remain so until Naxxramas is cleared.
---
Q: Is this a ‘server first’ guild?
---
A: As stated previously, raids up to and including Zul’Gurub are not priorities for this guild. Potential server first races for &lt;Trinkets on Trash&gt; begin with the opening of the Gates of Ahn’Qiraj.
---
Q: Will I have to farm my own mats for consumables for each raid? How intense will preparations be?
---
A: We will not require members to farm or bring consumable items aside from health and mana potions until after Molten Core and possibly later. Classic has been figured out quite thoroughly so far with the advent of practice servers, and we understand that these items will not be needed until future phases of content release.
---
Q: What is the current skill level of the guild raid-wise?
---
A: Several guild members have raided in top-server guilds in retail Vanilla. Many more have competitive experience in future expansions.
---
Q: Will this guild be on a realm with [my favorite streamer]?
---
A: This is a resounding no. This guild will be avoiding realms with streamers at all costs due to the type of environment they bring to their server. 
---
Q: I want Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker and Hand of Ragnaros.
---
A: Thunderfury will be given to tanks first. Hand of Ragnaros and subsequent Thunderfuries will be distributed based on performance or democratic vote.
---
Q: Scarab Lord?
---
A: It is ours. Who obtains the mount -- as the title may as of yet be unavailable in Classic -- is up to democratic vote. The player who obtains the mount (or title) must be our most dedicated and passionate member as well as be willing to put in the time required to obtain it.
---
Thanks for reading, and I'll see you in-game in August!
---
-Quackin
---
As far as I remember, they took that out in BC or WotLK, so it should be in classic.
---
i dunno bro when my streamer says the values are fine, the values are fine
---
Pretty certain people were using castbar addons in retail vanilla too though right?
---
lol dude you car about this shit if your a hunter and something  is in melee range and your pet cant grab aggo you are FUCKED capital FUCKED. Thats what it means to play hunter
---
&gt; and do any encounter up to mythic without spending much effort.

Proper raiding pretty much starts at mythic though. Before that I agree that it's pretty boring. Same with mythic+ before +10-15 (depending on gear). 
---
&gt;I just wonder what game would satisfy your PvP need that WoW does not deliver. WoW PvP had great moments and was a lot of fun before most classes became playable on a gameboy advance.
---
My most played game is probably Planetside 2. Played a lot of Chivalry medieval warfare too. And back in the day I played a lot of AoE2 and some Quake 3. Recently I played some Apex Legends when that came out, it was alright. If you want more similar to WoW a lot of people play Dota, and similar clones (never really got into that though), but at least I see what could make it a fun game. 
---
It's not that I think WoW PvP could necessarily be much better done, it's that the base game isn't suitable for PvP at all. In my opinion.
---
Hopefully.
---
Personally i find that idea much more pleasing than creating new vanilla content
---
I don't think the stress test will give you access after - as there is a separate 'Classic stress test' server, which i assume locks and unlocks during said stress tests
---
Yes, as my post addressed.
---
However, if invites go out today, they may just be for permanent closed beta access.
---
Tuesday I imagine the stress test invites will go out, and we have no idea if you will lose beta access if you only get invited to the stress test or if you get to keep it permanently after.
---
So there may still be a standard, permanent closed beta wave coming today.
---
The idea of warfront is cool. The implementation of it and it is forced it is makes it absolute shite.
---
Is there any chance that the devs intentionally reduced the mob / boss damage in beta to make sure players could more easily test the content? Just to make sure they had enough people complete the dungeons and world quests to know that it was at least working to the point that it was playable? Maybe damage will be normalized later in the beta?
---
Thank you! I had fun doing this random thing!
---
depends how the app is developed, essentially they are gonna do the same thing. Discord would be better cuz you can just jump in chat as well. Since classic was launched technology and development have come a long way, I dont see the issue with adding applications that make grouping easier. It'd be an issue if it made gameplay easier. Let people get creative with addons, as long as they dont give an advantage whats the issue?
---
"Starting to" ?
---
It doesn’t set any new precedent; game companies have been doing this for years, especially blizzard. Just look at Hearthstone and the streamer cult it has. Or any game with a beta these days.
---
Speaking from the side of purely business, Twitch is the perfect avenue for marketing. Blizzard doesn’t have to force the game onto us if we’re making the hype for ourselves. Streamers are gamers too so it makes for an instant connection to your product.
---
That all aside, yes it’s frustrating that “I didn’t get in and the popular guy did! &gt;:(“ but that’s the strategy Blizz went with and no amount of crying that it’s not fair will change that.
---
Since most of hs can't play its all we've got. Way better than arts and crafts.
---
&gt;Was ZA a 10 man
---
Yep!  And had the bear mount!
---
Absolutely agree except for gathering quests it is going to be so much pain to notice things on the ground in the grass.
---
Hunters, hybrid DPS, hybrid tanks, and other casuals are under-represented in these stats. Those invested in the game at this early stage are in the minority.
---
Were that the case, they would've explicitly said so, or at least I like to believe that.
---
If current Blizzard doesn't even listen to the communities issues with BFA what makes you think that a community voting system would happen for post Nax content.
---
Hey man, AV was the only BG alliance could win back in Vanilla. Horde just dominated WSG and AH for some reason.
---
Running running running need to ditch this mob so I can eat and heal, alright I'm safe .....
---
Mrgggllmrggllll

---
I'm coming with an assumption that we would transition from classic to TBC, which would mean that exactly the same thing would happen as back then. Guilds will break up. Isn't one of the points why we can't classic the 20/40man raids? Keep going with that. Now there is an option for people who want to do smaller scale raids, retail... turn 10 manners to 20 manners and 25 ones to 40. Like I said. This is MY hot dream, which I doubt will ever happen. 
---
Of course if decision would be to start totally new TBC server where you would have to level up from beginning etc. It would be different
---
Let's see your haircut.
---
&gt; Well, in theory the client controls the stuff like glancing blows and level based modifiers.
---
No, that's all server-side. The client does pretty much none of the game mechanics.
---
&gt;We can see this with the rage/mana/energy gen having to be fixed.
---
&gt;They also had to modify many abilities to match the new systems. Check through classic.wowhead.com to see abilities that were changed in 1.13. Almost all 'resource' abilities were tweaked, and even other ones like Armor debufs got touched.
---
Yeah, that stuff isn't in the database, but it's still calculated by the server. They probably forgot to change some of the formulae involved for the Blizzcon demo, which is why it was wrong there. The energy regen thing IIRC had something to do with clientside UI prediction or something like that.
---
I THINK?? In bc all cats were 1.3 but could be wrong
---
&gt;"I need sandworm meat"
---
&gt;Looted sandworm meat
---
Lol
---
Yes it is. Full list here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW\_6b\_z0oU/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#) 
---
other options are AV exalted or raid loot... or Smotts' Compass and Mark of the Chosen. Also enchanting may be a temporary profession just to craft it.
---
Possibly yeah. I forgot all about Broken Tooth. Humar was second fastest then, right? I think.... 
---
I know nothing of a "Lupus" but thanks for the info and the link!
---
I totally agree, I do think we all need to be aware of how the BFA beta went and be vocal early on, and pay attention to the changes made as this beta progresses.
---
I hope so ):
---
Yeah, I think most of the bows end up looking at least semi-tame, although very fantasy at times. Stuff like [rhok'delar](https://i.imgur.com/LPEXCI5.png) definitely isn't too extravagant while still hitting that vanilla fantasy sweetspot
---
I’ve met so many undead rogues from Quebec. Crazy
---
If you don't know who he is you must have not played vanilla or tbc.
---
im more interested in bc than vanilla but i can say beyond a doubt ill be running 60 nax untill there are no groups available to run it with.
---
if i run out of gear to get ill just make a new character
---
They actually do have the functionality to ban specific addons, it just hasn't been used. The game downloads a list of banned addons from the server, some private servers even have it configurable. Likewise, the client also uploads a list of addons for Blizzard to do fuck knows what with (probably usage analysis).
---
The banning mechanism is super, super weak though (name + some checksum). It'd only work to temporarily ban an addon that's causing major server issues. Anyone that wants to bypass it could just write a simple installer to give it a random name and add some random garbage to a file.
---
That is likely the situation. However, there is a wild card as it isn't just one stress test. Three stress tests would usually imply you're trying to increase the cap everytime.
---
So it could be..
---
Stress test - keep invites. That is the new server caps.
---
More invites for next stress test - keep invites - so on.
---
If layering works as intended, it doesn't matter that there would only be the PvP and PvE server for the beta test.
---
Regardless, there may still be a permanent closed beta wave going out today, with stress test invites being saved until tomorrow.
---

I had this happen and reported it. Funny enough the nameplate cleared when I hovered over the report bug button
---
He reminds me of those mouthbreathers that make a 10 min youtube montage of ganking low level players while playing “Disturbed - Down with the Sickness”
---
That's all I need. I've grown so dependent to that mod.
---
specifically addon functionality?
---
Yeah I know they could ride the regular orc wolf mounts in TBC, but I can't remember if it was like that in vanilla.
---
Both of them were coordinating their respective sides, along with other Streamers like Esfand, Venruki, Savix, Tipsout, etc. To say that they do not have some degree of ownership of this content that they helped to organise and stream is just retarded. 
---
I don't know why you people are so salty at streamers to be so fussy over every little detail that honestly doesn't matter. It's a video made on a video game on the internet where people are having fun, stop thinking it's anything more than that.
---
Bore-fronts (AKA: Snore-fronts) are where I order a pizza, make some food, /follow some randoms, eat some food, occasionally throw out a heal or tag a mob, then receive quest reward and never queue again.
---
That's cool that he named this character after the shadow priest from his old video/server.
---
Distracting Shot is not a taunting ability, only a threat increaser, so that could not really happen.
---
you still need battle.net access launcher
---
I do wonder how far they'll go.. like.. will they keep going and going..and going.. and going? Or is it only Vanilla wow content and then once at the end of that, will they stop?
---
That's because Horde is awesome
---
#nochanges
---
It does not hold up.
---
Staysafe himself confirmed on his stream that rep gain is slower.
---
So i craft the trincket and add some enchant on my gear and then switch to engi?
---
I fully plan on streaming the old blueplz episodes during leveling on twitch when classic releases. I may have only a few followers, but they need to get through that for his sake :)
---
The first month is going to be some of the best gameplay of all time.
---
You are mistaking retail for how it was.
---
As per your video link: https://youtu.be/PpdHZIPeSVg?t=225
---
This is the correct delay.  Your previous timestamp of the RezPet -&gt; Petattack is a totally different situation, rezing the pet has a variety of implications, as the pet would 'phase' in while having full control.
---
Few options here depending on what you want:
---
1. Enchanting - mainly for the "Smoking Heart of the Mountain" which gives you a lot of armor - a good alternative is the Maraudon Trinket tho
---
2. Engineering (first pick up Mining to get mats all the way to 60) - Engineering offers you some fun in PvP but also contributes to your raid: Chicken Buff in your Group or even Arcanite Dragonling - also the bombs to increase your DPS
---
3. Herbalism: Probably the most valuable gathering Profession - keep in mind you can farm spots / instances (due to cat stealth) which are hard to get to by other classes
---
I think that was a bug. I remember seeing it in BGs once in a while.
---
There are only a few things I can suggest that don't get really messy.  Basically anything that touches outlands, northrend, blood elves, and worgen are going to be too hot an issue to do anything with.  That leaves, Uldum, Hyjal, and caverns of time.
---
Nothing new under the sun. Friends &amp; Family, Media, and Pro-tier exclusive betas are as old as the industry itself. Try not to feel so butt-hurt about it.
---
They don't need a hundred thousand players giving them redundant and false feedback that they have to comb through for actual, meaningful critique.

that is literally nothing like that

" we want everyone to feel welcome, safe, and included in our games and communities. " - Mike Morhaime
---
Blizzard now purposefully excludes even their most loyal subscribers  from events  for the sake of marketing. I am one of the lucky ones but I still feel there was a better way to do this that would include everyone and not  force people to watching special snowflakes. 
---
All good things come to an end....
---
I guess so—I’ve never seen this level of viewership and collaboration from streamers though. Its the confluence of WoW classic’s game design and this new marketing strategy. New for me means within the past 5-10 years, so it’s still pretty new to me. Augmented Reality has been used in manufacturing for years as well, but I would still call it new.
---
People hate streamers, but if Soda’s plan for his mega/streamer server works out then epic events like this could happen way more often. Just think of the large scale battles that will happen.
---
Stopped 10 seconds in. Can’t deal with this fucks voice
---
We all do
---
Some people get bummed when the weekend is over, but really it's a chance all week at access. Could even be closed beta access invites Friday after the stress test, who knows.
---
Invite wise, it's basically only going to be weekday invites, with two filler stupid ass weekend days where Blizz is out of office and no waves go out.
---
Of course.
---
Pooping while on flight paths is optimal anyway, provided you build around food that doesn’t require wiping.
---
I will surely get herbalism. But i thought about skinning until 60 and then enchanting for the trincket and then engi.
---
How does it sound?
---
He's not providing any proof at all of how it should work in 1.12.
---
We have a wiki page and some old footage of a high level gnome, we don't even know which patch the footage is from.
---
Streaming has been and will continue to be a new age mainstream form of entertainment - has been like this the past few years and it’s only growing in popularity.
---
I for one am on the fence about the water. I loved hiding under it in STV nesingwarys camp because it’d be overrun and the water was a good place to get out
---
I honestly think TBC did the group finder tool perfect.
---
-_- I guess I need to edit my post. I thought I explained that I’m not butthurr
---
In case many of the well known arena streamers roll on the same server I'm considering joining that one, imo there's a good chance that that server will have an above average pvp community both in terms of skill and participation.
---
cant watch past 15 seconds sorry
---
No, it really wasn't. I was only rank 11 (commander) and that shit drained the life out of me. Rank 14 vets would generally not even play the game and have others do it for them since it was so time-wasting.
---
&gt; just telling them "this person is a fucking idiot".
---
DID U JUST ASSUME HIS POLITICAL VIEWS?!?
---
This makes it hard for me between tanking and healing. I definitely want to pvp, so im highly debating warrior or priest
---
There's no point in making assumptions at this point. How would you know if there weren't invites over the weekend? Using "past experiences" isn't good enough, it's still a presumption. How would Soda know? He's not affiliated with blizzard so his guess is as good anyone's. ***What is known*** ***is that invites are trickling in slowly.***
---
It's a beta, nobody is entitled to get in no matter how loyal or whatever they are.
---
Being excluded has always been a reality with Blizzard betas.
---
Either this is a meme or this guy is an absolute spasmoid.
---
the reason for him being there was for that quest. you basically have to have a raid to kill those lvl  40 mobs. thats just how the quest works. Nobody else has any use for those items anyways.
---
Right on both accounts
---
This sub was being incredibly hopeful about weekend invites because "it's just an automated person, you dont need a human to do anything." but historically that isn't how it works with Blizz

Looks nice!  Not sure why you got downvoted, jesus christ people, play the game how YOU want to play it, with or without addons.

&gt;Another question -  I have a 5 year old i3 CPU and no graphics card. If I add an RX570 (roughly equivalent to a GTX 1060), can I expect to play Classic on medium-high settings?
---
thanks that's good to know
---
You would understand what i was trying to say if you read my whole comment and also took my comment as a whole, instead you are isolating a sentence, taking it literally and trying to use it out of context to debunk my whole statement. 
---
That is being pedantic. That is not me ignoring anything. Literally no one wants to discuss with people like you, because all you care about is to deconstruct and destroy someone elses argument with all means possible (no matter how dumb they may be), instead of building your own compelling argument. 
---
Such a discussion is pointless. 
---
Anyway, since you cant take a hint im just going to block you.
---
No that makes no sense. The testing is about making it as authentic as possible and not just finding bugs.
---
Vanilla had addons, loads of them, even quest helpers. Hell, there was one that had an option to show the exact route to walk from point A to point B from quest to quest for fast leveling.
---
Stop looking for things to whine about.
---
I remember we had a CGF In our guild he tried to take some high cost items from the G bank cause he "needed them" and the breaking moment was mid pull on void reaver he hearthed to "Make a trade"  with a friend. Followed swiftly by a Gkick lol.
---
Ive been leveling a hinter on a retail and thought i was going insane
---
I was thinking the same. As long as I can achieve decent settings, i'll be happy.
---
Shout out to Ebbn as well. Their both great druid players
---
Yeah, same here, but you always end up forgetting something.
---
What bags?
---
That kid literally says in his first paragraph that he can dispel it....????
---
Hm... you can have engineering for the trinkets and gizmos, hard to tell how much value it will be. It's cool if you don't want to bother with professions at end-game that much :\]
---
Alchemy - if you will have someone with herbalism to help you then it's nice, if not then is dependent if people will put the right herbs on AH at sane prices which depends on active population :D If you get flask recipes then you can get paid for crafting them in Scholomance :) Also if you like fishing then free action potions as your go-to money maker that doesn't even need herbalism.
---
If you will have mining while leveling and then drop it for engineering be sure to check how much stuff you have stashed from mining before dropping it - if you are low on some ore or like arcane crystals for arcanite bars for some of your engi trinkets then mine those before dropping. Similarly with alchemy - don't start it before you get a stash of herbs to kickstart it - that your herb source is reliable ;)
---
Sure. Tell yourself that. Blizz adjusts plans on the regular, and there is zero chance that if Classic is a hit, they'll let it stagnate 2 years down the road.
---
We for sure have a solid 1-2 years where it will be purely classic, but eventually people *will* either complete and farm Naxx, and/or get bored of the other content that they're actually able to perform.
---
Private servers have had popular issues for years, and often times combated this with tweaks to the game to give a slightly original spin to the tried and true method.
---
Blizz is not going to be happy with just private server levels of engagement (and revenue).
---
100% expect them to have plans to move the game either forward (through the expansions) or enhance classic with original content post-naxx, within 2 years of release.
---
You're honestly naïve if you believe otherwise.
---
About Kungen: When he left Tarren Mill for another server the horde/alliance ratio went from 60/40 to 10/90. 
---
For people who don’t care about streamers a fair warning: Stay away from them.
---
they prob avoid it incase a bunch of people log on at the same time and it causes instability

---
If it's red they're dead, should of chosen the right faction.
---
YES! THANK YOU!! This needs as much exposure as possible. I reported this yesterday in the Classic Beta because I experienced this exact same thing you mentioned (i'm leveling a hunter in the beta). It is driving me INSANE!
---
Besides what you've already detailed (excellently), I have notice the overall behavior of the pet is just so erratic. Even without giving it any command, I will be walking around and it will randomly fly away off and then come back sometimes. It is really weird.
---
Also: 90% of the time I keep my pet on passive. So sometimes (while on passive mode) the pet wont even attack when I give it the attack command. It happens quite often - usually happens when I have 2 mobs on the pet, and one mob is almost dead, and before death i will tell it to switch to attacking the 2nd mob by giving it the attack command while targeting the 2nd mob, and i will finish off killing the first one, and then the first one will die, and then i will see my pet come back to my side. I will be like, wtf didn't i just tell you to attack the 2nd one? GET BACK OUT THERE AND FIGHT, BITCH! That happens a lot and it is just part of this overall unresponsiveness that is driving me crazy.
---
Alliance just fucking sucks at organizing.
---
That will be me
---
What tools did you use to get this data?
---
Really? The same classic experience that had addons back then? It's no one's fault but your own you didn't look for or use them during actual vanilla and can't wrap your head around the fact they've always been around.
---
I'm very familiar with the druid post-classic, but that makes sense that no one likes hybrids in classic because they are jack of all trades.
---
Where is this pic from? Feels like I've seen it a million times but can't put my finger on where
---
Ask yourself this: What makes you more valuable to the beta than Asmongold?
---
There is no answer. That is the truth. Streaming wasn't around in 2004. You either grow with the times or you rely on RNG.
---
And besides, it's just fucking beta.. It isn't like they get to play the launch two weeks sooner than you.
---
Just use ElvUI, it's much better
---
Eh.
---
He's a level 25-30 warrior in some nice mail gear, with a shield, easily pushing 1700 armor with devo, vs level 20-25s in those clips.
---
That's 42% damage reduction.
---
Then Defensive stance. He's over 50% damage redux.
---
He's comparing it to a level 39 gnome in vanilla with similar armor rating 1,750 but in **berserker stance** and wondering why the gnome is getting hit for 20% more?
---
Similar armor ratings, with the one with -10% damage reduction stance and the one with +10% damage taken are 20% different? Stop the presses!
---
The title of your post sets a false narrative.
---
All I'm really saying is; this "beta" is mostly just a media stunt to gauge interest and disseminate information to the player base with minimal investment of promotional resources, since streamers already have a vehicle to do it, easily.
---
That's my take on it, anyway.

ABOUT US:
---
Atlas is currently recruiting high-level, team players. Our current core is tight-knit and made up of players who played retail Vanilla and on private servers. Many of us are proven to be the best at the games that we play. We have stuck together through multiple MMORPGs and other competitive, team games. We know what it takes to be the best and welcome others who share that vision.
---
WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?
---
We are striving for an enjoyable launch experience by streamlining levelling and pre-raid gearing through cooperation and communication. It takes a team to clear raid smoothly. The same goes for levelling, questing, and gearing. We are looking for players who will put in the effort to ensure that our team is in the best possible shape, not individual characters. We will conduct our first raid at the end of the second raid reset. Subsequent raids will aim to be fast and efficient each week Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED?
---
Atlas is a hardcore guild. Understanding loot council and giving/receiving criticism is a necessity of our team environment. We need hardcore levelers and team players on launch in order to meet our goal of week 2 raid. After the launch, we expect 100% unexcused raid attendance.**
---
APPLY TO ATLAS:
---
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers on Discord (AEric, B, Carlt0n) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

I mean, the Ranged Attack formula is clearly not designed with any min range in mind, so I don't actually know how it would apply if at all.  I just assume 8 yards from the center of the target, but now that I think about, if that was the case, then on huge bosses like Ragnaros, wouldn't Hunters be able to shoot virtually in melee range?
---
So on second thought, perhaps the formula changed a little bit from pre-Cataclysm to that one with Cataclysm when they removed the min range from Hunters?  Huh.  And if the min range is being applied like you're suggesting, that would actually explain it.  Hm!
---
Echo isles wasn’t added until MoP. Definitely not from 2005. Also you have exp towards your next level, which would mean 60 isn’t the cap when you took this screenshot.

I second this notion!

---
I mean, Asmongold got McConnell into beta, so I am sure they have some inkling of when waves are going to go out and have communication, as streamers have a good communication flow with Blizzard, especially during these times.

Everytime there has been a wave of invites, there are threads about it. There was no such thing during the weekend.

I was really surprised to see this one on there. This just dramatically upped my chances of being a healer though.
---
I have my own hours so I will just take 2 weeks or something off. I don't really have a BIG plan, I will run with a friend and leave the starting zone at level 4 to avoid the cluster, then farm certain mobs for a while to get ahead.
---
Me and my friend will probably be up for at least 36 hours so we can sleep during night time the next day and wake up early in the morning and feel refreshed.
---
I think you inferred the narrative, rather than reading the post completely.
---
My post is highlighting exactly what you’re saying.
---
News to me, thanks!
---
why's that? I thought gnome has great caster racials.
---
Thanks for the heads up. Gonna try and buy 6
---
I pretty much watch when im at work since I cant play at the time.
---
&gt; What is the purpose of warfront
---
The reward. You do it once per week for a purple that is high item level. 
---
Then you just start skipping it cause you can't be bothered. Then you stop playing. Then you unsubscribe (again). Then you try and forget about BFA. Then you start looking into classic again and reply to someone in a reply to a meme about warfronts.
---
are those mobs only killable by alliance?
---
I was in this raid last night on the Horde side, that was basically how it went down.
---
Yea but, how many dudes have you banged?
---
Praise the lord!
---
RemindMe! 2 years "this guy think wow devs will create content for classic WoW onces he's done farming Naxx"

Downvotes only strengthen my resolve

From the results so far it seems like they kinda forgot about EU (as usual)

---
takin way more damage than on the beta and being higher level.
---
Why are people downvoting?
---
This i can see alot of people just thinking oh hey its just a beta
---
and that why you see some of them even ninja cause its fun and they won't really get a chance to do proper ninjaing again without people going "wtf" for real
---
Yes! When you opened the flap right?
---
Wasnt there already a Button in vanilla that does that?
---
Oh, apologies then for misunderstanding your tone.
---
As always TITS OUT
---
Yeah they really did a 180 with the expansions. Good thing we get our old world back!
---
Haha no way?! People recruiting already?? I'll go check it out :)
---
Tmw you just finish fighting at low health and the respawns pop... Mrllgrlggrlrglllgll

Yep. I was really surprised to see this one on there so quickly.

What class should I pick if I want to counter moderators?

No you cannot :)
---
Because we used addons in vanilla?
---
It's not the streamers we have problems with.  It's the hundreds of crazy fans that will follow them around.  Things like:
---
1. Getting help from fans on launch day to boost them ahead of the pack (i.e. they tag a mob, ungrouped fans kill it to give them XP.
---
2. Huge entourages escorting them around contested zones, making them free from PvP.
---
3. If you steal their mineral or herb node on live stream, you'll get tons of harassing messages about how horrible you are.
---
4. There's no chance of getting an AQ mount on the same realm as a streamer
---
5. If the streamer quits, suddenly your server collapses
---
WRONG. Timmy with 20 viewers was given access due to him being an influencer. THAT is where this differs from other BETA's that were pure RNG.

Is mob damage correct or not?
---
Pretty sure that Azeroth Auto Pilot is getting ported. Its even better.

&lt;Suboptimal&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Hardcore
---
Schedule: Split Raids (Sunday 12 PM EST) (Tuesday/Thursday 7:30 PM EST) You are not required to attend both no worries
---
Introduction: We are a small guild coming over from the private server scene, that plans on being hardcore PvPers through the first few raids, and hardcore PvEers through AQ and Naxx. We have a dedicated group of officers and GMs that have all have years of raiding and pvping experience in Classic. We love really good players and new players that have a lot of drive.
---
PvE Plans: Suboptimal is looking for neckbeards and social players to join our ranks. We are a guild dedicated to promoting a chill atmosphere while still crushing all of the content. We plan on downing rag in the 3rd or 4th week, downing Nef in the first week, everything in aq(maybe not C'thun) in the first week, and progressing through Naxx at our own pace for fun! If this style of guild interest you please hit us up.
---
PvP Plans: With ranking coming out in phase two, we are going to be running a bunch of PvP specs through MC/BWL while still clearing it. Almost all of our officers and many of our core members plan on ranking between 10-14 and all plan to do it before AQ comes out, where the guild will shift more towards a PvE focus, but if you are a hardcore PvPer and like to win, you are going to want to be a part of our premades.
---
Expectations: We will have different ranks with different expectations, if you are a raider or a core raider, we expect you to show up consumed and know your rotation curses ect which will be assigned from your class officer. As a social or member of the guild we have some guidelines laid out, but pretty much just don't be a jerk. 
---
Discord: We are going to run everything through discord to keep it super simple for our raiders and PvPers alike, so no digging through or signing up for websites and all of that.
---
Thank you and we hope to hear from you soon!

7.55 "never played anything in vanilla" I was seriously hoping to find some information of use in this vid but after watching you make a fire build based on reading the talent description and with ZERO knowledge about how fire builds are used in raids.  
---
Honestly please take this as constructive feedback, you dont need to read the description out to the player, you need to give them additional information about synergy between abilities and talents.  You needed to do a LOT more research and gain some actual experience before making a video with "guide" in the title.  You should have named this video, "Me looking at a vanilla mage for the first time".
---
I am sorry to be so harsh, but really to be a content creator that gets any success you need to make sure you research and plan before start recording.  Its very obvious to anyone with and experience that you have literally zero understanding of the class or its mechanics.  
---
Some tips to help you out, EVERY mage should be levelling frost, you either build deep frost or arcane frost to utilize clear-casting.  Its THAT simple.  Frost offers more control, lower threat in groups, greater efficiency as well as less spells you NEED to learn.  You can stay in EITHER frost spec until you hit 60, at that point you "may" consider a hybrid build for pvp realms and BG's, but there is no reason to be fire until you are raiding in AQ and Naxx exclusively.  What I typed in this paragraph is all ANY mage needs to know, and it took you nearly 30mins to literally confuse a new player.  You give the impression that any talent tree is fine, well arc tree is all about supporting your main tree, not to mention some of your talent choices were just weird.  
---
Not trying to dissuade you from making more, but trying to advise that you plan your content before recording and making sure you research plenty to make sure you try to provide NEW information to players not just read whats on the screen.
---
The current lfg system in retail is great, it makes making manual groups really nice without the spam in chat.  Lfd/lfr not so much, but lfg is good.
---
I think this is intended and has to do with the spell bashing changes.  There are issues where you can direct a pet to attack someone who has gone stealthed if you do it at the same time.  I believe this fixed that.  Your pet shouldn't be able to find and break an enemies stealth.
---
What exactly is the downside of this?  A bit of lag between a pet going to attack a target doesn't seem as game breaking as a player going stealth as someone commands attack and then the pet just chases them down anyway.
---
This one is for all you OG’s &lt;3 congrats bois
---
It's a US based company but they decide to launch at 3pm CA time? just launch it in the morning, cant understand the thought process tbh
---
It's useful for classes with slow weapon speeds. Mobs usually have a 2.0s swing while warriors tend to favor much slower speeds, like 3.8s. This leads to the mob getting two hits in while the player only gets one. However, warriors can hamstring kite to make sure they trade one for one, thus reducing lost how and time between pulls.
---
Ha. Good thing I'm off to college. Only thing I gotta worry about is school, homework, social life, and pretty much everything else when I visit home.
---
It was repeatedly happening. If you see chat you'll see that I mention that the mobs disappear/reappear when I enter/leave the tunnel.
---
So one gotta move your grudge from years ago on other people because they happen to play the same game ? I mean if these guys did it, why should you take it on the millions playing retail ?
---
If you unsatisfied with the example because it could be taken as an attack how about this : did you saw any post on the wow reddit insulting or making fun of the classic fans ? Most of retail players are either hyped for classic or don't care. Meanwhile you find memes about how retail players are sheep, jalous and so on.
---
My issue is that it seems okay for some to insult the retail playerbase but no criticism shall ever be accepted about vanilla. You may hate what WoW has become, but why hate those who still play it ?
---
That's an issue with part of this community, and it bothers me. Why would people who behave this way be any better in classic ?
---
Its slower but runecloth turnins are in
---
Zip it fanboy. Thy asshole's stretched too wide yet no streamers are occupying it. Maybe Mr. Douche'll cut off his hair and make it into a ball then use it to seal your deal.
---
The worst part is seeing these all of a sudden change colors and state how much they are "wrong" on YouTube after putting it down so much
---
he can definitely be a bit bitchy and i would say a bad raid leader. that being said putting together an impromptu pvp raid and trying to lead it while trying to finish your quest with 70k live viewers all trying to talk to you at the same time is kind of impressive.
---
This didn't appear to be layering though. The mobs would reappear/disappear when I entered/left the tunnel.
---
But you're still competing against the other team and can kill them etc, while Warfronts are just a PvE scenario.
---
Sadly this is a representation of what the elite class in real life receive as well, just much more visible for us on twitch.

**&lt;Moist&gt; PvE Horde NA Casual**
---
**Intro:**
---
We are Moist, a collection of friends (and some significant others) having come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla. 
---
We are all excited for this release.  For some it’s about nostalgia, for others it’s about experiencing classic for the first time.  Regardless of why we are here we can all agree we are here to have fun. We are a casual guild but that does not mean we aren’t aiming to succeed.  We want to create a comfortable atmosphere so we can all experience the game in a positive way. Play what you want, play how you want, play when you want.  We are accepting and open to players of all types.
---
Classic WoW relied heavily on individual and guild reputation.  We will strive to make Moist synonymous with quality: quality players, quality attitudes, quality experiences.  Anyone who encounters a member of Moist should leave thinking that we are knowledgeable, respectful, fun, and all around awesome!
---
**Expectations:** 
---
Members should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild. Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a loot council but we try to be fair and transparent as well. We’re looking for people to help share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than focus too heavily on progression. 
---
**Raid Schedule:** 
---
We are planning to run two separate raid IDs, one on Thursdays at 6 pm PST (9 pm EST) and the other on Saturdays 6 pm PST (9 pm EST), for targeting 40 player content. By having two raid groups, we hope to be flexible for people’s schedules while also providing a large player base for smaller group content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out schedule. 
---
**Contact:**
---
If you are interested and want to be part of our discord for release day organization, then please message @Slaugth#9941 on discord or even a DM here on reddit with a discord contact (I don't check reddit as often so please be patient).
---
I wasn't able to. I was able to get someone to test this macro, but there wasn't time to get them to make a ticket.
---
I agreed with you that the anti streamer circlejerk is ridiclious on this subreddit, but after watching this video I think Tips is a pathological liar. He's one of the best Vanilla duelers on h3nh0use? Does he even have access to that server?
---
100k now, 1 mil at launch.
---
Fucking love you guys.
---
Just curious, do we have to have a live sub to have a chance at future waves?
---
When I played the demo the hunter pet worked amazingly on my 20ms ping.
---
Oddly I didn’t ever notice problems in BFA either... being a hunter main I hope they do address it. But in my personal experience the pet in the demo was more responsive than any private server.
---
For classic, I would imagine that it just tracks progression since there is no scaling content like M+. Similar to getting your gear inspected. Doubt this will see widespread use or have much effect tbh.
---
Ranjii you fucking loser. Get off Reddit. Go practice your 1 thru 20.

Make sure to roll on every weapon, especially those rare thrown weapons in LBRS.
---
Why not add more mods to keep up with the large intake?
---
Lol wtf did I just read hahaha
---
Idk what 1 thru 20 is lolol raging?
---
/salute to all the mods
---
I hated dealing with just a simple realm forums moderation, I do NOT envy the stress and workload you fine people coping with. So I will say you have my appreciation at least
---
I made alts back then because of respec cost.
---
I don’t think there’s anything for horde that’s as good as this one, but its very very unlikely this spot is gonna be a thing in Classic. And very high amount of runecloth :)
---
Shroud was streaming his shaman yesterday.
---
while on this topic, do you remember what tanking defence cap was to be uncrittable ?
---
That's why I said generally expected to heal, not always.
---
Thank you for confirming :P
---
Those places also tend to earn a lot more too.
---
Hi, I’m a wow vet who is looking to find a guild. I have 2-4 rl friends who will be playing as well and we are looking for a place to meet new people and play with. We all have cleared all the classic 40mans when they were current and are fun guys who love a good time. If that fits with your ethos please contact me so we can get in touch
---
It will be epic!
---
Except Pally/Warlock wasn't an option
---
True, but its free marketing so
---
Wow. I had abandoned my original vanilla account like eleven years ago so I gave this a shot. Not only was it resolved in like an hour, the GM who did so gave me a month of free gametime. I'm not kidding.
---
Unless you are going for ultimate min/max, no. It won't be a problem. The difference is negligible.
---
Good thing they have pretty much taken it out of retail again at this point :) 
---
Wouldn't worry about it for classic, since obviously teleports aren't a thing anyway, and most people would want some kind of choice in who to invite for a group, not just an automatic invite system.
---
i have seen another similar post on here im pretty sure its layer related from his video
---
i certainly could be wrong obviously report it
---
Name?
---
why do you think it wont be a thing? you can get there without wall walking if i remember, but it looks as though you need an epic mount for some of the jumps
---
Even common sense tells you something is not right. I recently clicked on one of Asmongolds video on youtube and I saw exactly the same thing that was showed in this video - charging into 3-5 elites in SFK like its nothing. I remember it blew my mind, since doing anything like this was impossible on any private server. Are private servers accurate? Prob not. However, the challenge, that private servers provides is much more rewarding that this boring faceroll, we are seeing on beta.
---
Which patch is the footage from? How does his gear and talent setup compared to what Asmongold was wearing?
---
You need to be able to answer these things if we're going to be able to compare the two.
---
You obviously have never raided with 20-40 people. The attention span of human beings is ridiculously short.
---
Yes the gold/hour with skinning is really nice, especially since you'll be lvling as feral. Cat form movement speed increase just enhances this. I would endorse and recommend this
---
The level of collaboration (50 of the top streamers in one battle) from streamers has created an almost “cool kid corner” feel to how this specific beta watches on twitch. This is the first time I’ve felt like all the actors from different movies are all in the same banquet hall clapping for each other and we’re all watching with baited breath. 
---
I’ve never seen 50 prominent streamers interacting ingame like that before. For me this was a moment where it cemented that this is how betas are going to be used not just at Blizzard but at other companies moving forward, it’s just too powerful from a marketing standpoint.
---
Sure, twitch has been used for marketing since its inception, thats what it is. This is a whole new level of collaboration and community engagement IMO though, and its been persistent for days.
---
Blizzard invites players that are invested with the game as a priority. I've been a cutting edge heroic/mythic raider since MoP and was guaranteed a beta invite in at least the second wave every expansion. 
---
These influencers and content creators are invested with the game because that's how most of them make their living. Yes, it's mostly a marketing setup on the first waves. Every wow website and streamer back as far as I can remember for betas got in the day it launched with a few random invites along with that. Classic is (so far) no different from the rest of them. The second "big wave" was always the higher end players especially when dungeon and raid content was starting up. 
---
I don't know how they will handle classic since the only players you could consider heavily invested are people that have been subscribed from day one, but blizzard confirmed that doesn't help you get in this beta.
---
The only thing that has been 100% consistent is content creators and fansites getting in first and everyone on forums giving their reason (or whining depending on your view) why they deserve to be in.
---
He said "good"
---
sorry too easy to pass up
---
Yeah that's how I remember it even if I only started to play at the end of TBC. There was so much to do at every level it was crazy.
---
Unlike retail right now that's just a rush to max level and raid-or-die.
---
"Cu german"
---
"Cu chinese"
---
That had me laughing for quite a bit.
---
Are you checking elite damage or normal mobs? Everyone is discussing elite damage, normal mobs seem fine.
---
There is a debate. "Everything is up for negotiation"     
---
We came this far.     
---
We got this much.    
---
Don't try and "you think you do but you don't" me. We all know how that ends :)
---
KAIO-KEN!
---
Fuck yeah
---
iirc, shockadin was only viable once you could get T2 and beyond, due to a lack of +spell damage plate up to that point. 
---
I need someone who played pally to confirm, though. I mained hunter throughout vanilla.
---
You're right, but tbh I made this comment only to discuss wether that IB stance was really there in 1.12, as apparently it was already changed in the BC prepatch. It's quite possible that in that case Beta is right.
---
Like a server where it would be against ToS to flim other players w/o thier permission?
---
The original video covers some of it, but besides its really hard to simulate it since nobody has access to the reference client.
---
If only Blizzard could confirm if the mob damage is correct or not.
---
As an asshole rogue, my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
Well atleast i can kill quest npcs again
---
Why is someone an idiot for liking a particular streamer? If they enjoy it why would anyone try to stop their enjoyment?
---
This looks like a phasing bug, report it.
---
In fact add one were much more powerful in vanilla and we had some that did some crazy ass shit that was essentially playing the game for us.
---
Realm first 60 at 3 months
---
He is literally affiliated with Blizzard, though. All the big streamers are. They are 100% in contact with people in the inside. They all got invited to Irvine to play the beta before it released officially. I don’t think Sodapoppin himself attended AFAIK, but he knew the beta was coming out in advance of when we did.
---
The number of big streamers in the beta is around 10 or so. There are probably more than a thousand people in the beta so...... what the hell is the problem again?
---
Most youtubers/streamers do well with a face cam... you my friend, would not.
---
That’s what made vanilla so great. It was more about the journey and less about the destination
---
That's what the expansions were meant for. To continue questing and gaining new abilities and exploring new zones.
---
Yes, the greater challenge made it more fun. How is that hard to understand. Like I said, I’m not advocating for any changes. I was just surprised to see how easy the dungeons are with these lower damage values.  That said I haven’t played yet; I’ll go in with an open mind.
---
Hoping they bring back Pitbull Unit Frames ( i think this is what i used in vanilla) and bartender.
---
Its from 2006, so what the fuck can you expect?
---
Its already almost impossible to find valuable vanilla videos besides the Joana guide, so you don't get a better reference than this
---
You'd be stuck waiting while levelling as well. Levelling is slow - people often don't return to a capital city unless they're changing zone or have spells to learn. Lets say I want a group for Scarlet Monastery - players who might join me will be spread out over Arathi, Alterac, Badlands, Desolace, Dustwallow, STV as well as in cities. I can either fly to each zone and ask in general chat, wait in a city and spam the trade channel or whisper random players. I often give up on dungeons and go back to grinding/questing.
---
I don't think it's the same community. The people who think LFR is a great concept and that BFA is a good game are most likely not gonna care about classic.
---
Well I think that's speculation. We'll see what actually happens. That being said, there are some super hardcore players.
---
I've noticed this happening too. Best I can describe it is like there are boundaries within zones that define what's shown in the client. You could be running through the barrens for example and you'll cross a point at which a lot will come into view at once and fade away behind you. Sometimes there is lag crossing this point and things will just suddenly appear around you. Other times there is a mob right on the boundary and it will appear and disappear as you cross back and forth. It's not exactly sharding because that npc is always 'there', but it's distressing for sure. Blizzard is treating those as bugs though not features which is good.
---
Sweet thanks. Yeah, paladin if I go alliance (but can go warlock if enticed enough) and warlock if I go horde. Brother is going mage but I like both classes just fine, many benefits to both.
---
Just curious on overall horde vs alliance balance, WPVP difference before Phase 3 (obviously depending on population), leveling doesn't matter to me, and getting raid spots etc. Just curious to hear. Ty!!
---
Warlock main here. This sometimes happened when I would use Mortal Coil it also would happen randomly. I’d run around and pull as many mobs as I could so I could lay down the PvP Bane talent (super OP for open world PvE content btw) and chaos bolt everything to death only to realize I’m getting hammered by these mobs and seeing that my voidwalker was just standing next to me, not even auto attacking. I’ve tried to replicate it to no avail but it does happen from time to time. Drives me bonkers lol
---
*And I... am... Omar Gonzalez.*
---
Where did they say that?
---
You do realize it's "beta" for a reason, right?
---
Might have been unclear, but this happens for pets in general. I took notice to it when I played my hunter because hunter pets have a lot more impact on your damage than warlock pets. Not sure about mage's water elementals but they're casters so probably works differently mechanically.
---
Thing is that sometimes, since it started during legion when you had two hunter pets, one would continue attacking the target while the other ran back to you. Very odd, and even more so that it hasn't been fixed yet.
---
I think that could be a possible approach, basically removing streaming from highly populated areas where it would be impossible to determine player consent. That would essentially undermine anyone’s attempts to build a streaming community.
---
I was speaking about the "design analysis" part. They don't know what makes a game desirable and what gives a game flavour.
---
Because this is going to happen on release regardless of streamers or not and just because a streamer participates in it, will it be his or event too?
---
Yes, that's why playerbase is split in 2 or even 3 big groups, but mostly the arguments fall into a big divider line: if it's cosmetic stuff, for the player only, eye candy for his own screen -- and the other part is if it has any implication (advantages/disadvantages) if one player has a setting on vs a player with it off. In the case of water, this sure has implications between players with different settings, while shadows don't have.
---
I don’t disagree with any of your post—I just wish you had comprehended mine
---
Very good points. Simply looking at the two clips and saying "this number is bigger than that number, reeeeeeee!" is beyond stupid.
---
Yeah TBC was amazing. People always say flying mounts ruined WoW but I thought they were fine in TBC. I would love if they moved to that expansion after classic
---
Not trinket.
---
Spell batching exists on live. I experience it just about every other week. You seem to think it's gone, but all they did was cut the time between batches down significantly such that common vanilla-MoP problems with it were significantly became significantly less frequent.
---
No, it is more that it "actually isn't as fun as you think and you'll realise it soon".  
---
Doesn't mean you can have fun while it lasts. 
---
I played till 4hm and I am sure as hell going to play it through rose tinted glasses. Have fun leveling, gearing, maybe raid and play some end game. Then hit the day I take the glasses off (or not?) and quit. 
---
So the fact that Classic will most likely have an expiration date means that some people believe it is not worth starting.
---
i wouldn't call pfui a shitty version of anything. very well made ui, probably the best for 1.12 clients.
---
No different than raid frames with mouse over macros
---
Really blows my mind that people are getting so triggered over this.
---
Having to coordinate a raid = good
---
Click a button and get into a raid = bad
---
Are you opposed to people joining a LFG channel manually and spamming LFG messages? It's exactly the same principle, just less annoying.
---
Cdew is another good option! He has started theory crafting a little bit, and is enjoying the classic shaman.
---
The destination was also great :) bu yea the journey was just as great.
---
I personally enjoy the grind behind vanilla raiding and getting to know your guild &amp; bond with them. It sounds to me like you've had a number of bad experiences and extrapolated that to mean that raiding in vanilla is no fun at all. 
---
Only thing that gets super tedious to me is consumable farming, but raiding itself is plenty fun, and one of the main draws to me, for classic.
---
WeaponSwingTimer dev here, glad to see  someone added it! I've added another one of mine, [QualityTime](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/qualitytime).
---
Orgrimmar raids for me
---
&gt; takin way more damage than on the beta and being higher level.
---
Bruh. He's in berserker stance and Asmongold is in Defensive stance.
---
Influencers are overall good for the game, and so is ANY kind of drama within the community
---
*"Alright, chumps. Time's up.* ***LET'S DO THIS:"***
---
I don’t mind you’re opinion but please remove the last paragraph, people want classic for there own reasons. I for one am pretty excited for the honor system.
---
Murlocs quietly stacking they body count. Nothing kills me more while leveling then murlocs. You go to pull one and an army of gurgling ass holes comes to run you down nets and all.
---
Yep I used to use them in vanilla, otherwise I'd find myself kicking people's hearthstones instead of heals.
---
So if I'm understanding your concerns correctly, the beta won't impact the final product? 
---
Highly doubt it. Furthermore, Classic's developers aren't the retail developers either, as proven several times by now.
---
Cdew is the best shaman In my opinion
---
I used to be totally anti stream watching. On paper it sounds dumb as shit, but these goddamn asmond clips fascinate me. Not only from a psychological standpoint, but the shear mass of his fan club is hilarious. He literally gets carried by his power in numbers. At the same time he will never have a 2005 classic solo experience again.
---
Joanna will probably be realm first 60 wherever he rolls
---
You get 5% at Friendly, 10% at Honored, 15% at Revered and 20% at Exalted.
---
"hovewer be real, Raids and Honor farming is not the reason why ppl want to go back to WoW."
---
i love you assume what everyone wants and thinks. I enjoy 40 man raids with simple slower mechanics. play it for why you like it and stop trying to convince others otherwise
---
I've primarily been doing open world testing since a lot of focus was already in dungeons. I actually just did an elite spider in stonetalon and again it was correct. Once I hit 30 I'm going to go back with a group and do instanced comparisons.
---
To be fair, basically no one plays original rules D&amp;D. There's been a bunch of revisions.
---
&gt;So You become addicted and want to play game more and more, but You hit lvl 60, prepare your gear by crafting, some pvp, 5 man dungeons, and then you have to choose raiding or farming honor.  
---
&gt;And both things sucks. You have to keep doing same raid over and over again, You gonna stuck with same ppl forever. Nothing new and interesting gonna happen, You just prepare for raid then go through corridor with mobs and bosses.
---
I enjoy the same raid over and over if I or my friends are getting the stuff we need, and also looking at dps/hps numbers and competing against your past self and said friends. I find that fun, maybe you don't but talking for the whole of the community is very arrogant.
---
&gt; You are no longer playing MMO, you are playing game inside MMO, You are no longer in persistent big world, You are no longer in world of warcraft, You are now in instances of warcraft. 
---
Explain this it very abstract
---
&gt;Same thing with pvp, instead of creating some different system and let ppl fight in open world, Blizzard created honor grind where you are closed inside battlegrounds which are no different than just playing multiplayer game, like League of Legends or Dota. Not gonna say retail pvp is better, because 3v3 deathmatches in MMO game is even more stupid than 10v10 battlegrounds. 
---
Tbf you can choose not to go into battlegrounds and get groups of people to go city raiding and get tons of kills/honor in that way. This is just an option like a 5-10 man dungeon (that are not apparently mmo shattering, though the same idea behind it) and give the player the option of not needing to find 39 other people, just a handful.
---
Finaly some good ol pvp!
---
What's more likely, your post the other day where you said waves are going out everyday, or when there is NOTHING on social media during the weekend about invites, meaning waves are only on the weekdays?
---
Even in a battle of assumptions, mine is more likely than yours.
---
Lol, no.
---
A buddy of mine still rocks that on his hunter to this day. He'll never get rid of it lol and plans on getting it again asap come beta. I look forward to helping him be one of the first with it!
---
&gt; Is there any chance that the devs intentionally reduced the mob / boss damage in beta to make sure players could more easily test the content?
---
Its more likely that people don't know what they're talking about.
---
Gross
---
Shut the fuck up, he walks her all the time you're delusion. Just looking for negativity lmao
---
We're all shit at the game, so pick whatever dude.
---
Being a YouTube creator isnt for everyone, you're one of those people it isn't for.
---
Logical turn of events is following progression as it was on retail
---
I have to admitt I love these battles and I would like to be part of it. But then I remember that 95% of pvp is gang, a level 60 dude in lakeshire or stv trying to ruin your day. I will play on the RP server and I hope that there will be organized pvp events as well!
---
None of this is reality
---
catheter, poop bowl, feeding tube, iv for hydration, and some columbian bam bam.... basically will need to be on hospice life support.
---
I did make note that the pvp video could be chalked up to just lag, however I also pointed out that even with lag, the distance between melee and range attack is super small compared to what you may have experienced on pservers or in the beta. It just doesn't feel right. It feels too big. It's hard to know for sure bc it's not like anyone else back in vanilla did range checks... I believe we're on to something though with it being just auto-shot as actually 10 yds. Will need to check on the beta to see if you can duel someone at max range (9.9 yards) and not able to auto shot.
---
As a warrior you make your own groups so that kills 99% of the LFG time. But some dungeons can take 1-2 hours to do by themself.
---
Well without actual proof we can't really say that it's wrong. Guessing doesn't help.
---
Let's say that the footage in the 2006 clip is from 1.12 then we need to do A LOT of math using the talent setups of the two players, the stances, the gear and the buffs they have on them. 
---
Just because the damage on the higher level player is higher doesn't mean that it's incorrect.
---
Just play to 30 on a pserver
---
I loved watching Asmons chat. "Are allies going to be this outnumbered in release?" No my friend you weren't out numbered. You were crushing by the glorious war machine that is the horde. Paladins will not save you now boy lol.
---
This is legit, lmao.
---
There are a lot of stuff you can't do on classic, like seeing the enemy cast bar or health, or even enemy debuff/buff timers (technically doable, but not in the same way as retail). So you will probably have to adjust it quite a bit anyway.
---
There’s like 10-20 big streamers, around 50-100 content creators.
---
THANK YOU! Agree 100%...
---
Lets have a look in my glassball:
---
Year 2+: Naxx Phase 6
---
Year 4: Karazhan will open (Tier 3,5 - +1% increase in every stat, just to say a small number)
---
Year 6: Grim Batol (Tier 4 - +1% increased stat of T3,5)
---
Year 8: Hyjal area will open with instance...
---
To be continued... Still level 60 and  there is always room for some small changes in the feature in Eastern Kingdom and Kalimdor. No need for BC and so on, what eventually will split the community. Everything and everybody in the same world. Btw in Hyjal we will need sharding ... ehm layering then :-)
---
It's happening right now on the beta.
---
We've recently added /u/Greekball and /u/Paulingtons to the team. Whilst /u/Paulingtons isn't here to help moderate but instead to try and set up better automod support both here and on Discord, he's occasionally dipping into the queue too. 
---
As we've just had two new moderators join we'd rather stay as is for a short while to assess how things proceed. It's also worth noting that this level of activity might actually calm down once people can actually play the game, rather than all of that hype getting poured into posts here. 
---
Either way, we have an excellent shortlist of mods we might be getting in touch with from when we recently opened applications, but for now, we'll assess.
---
Hey, when your personality is as interesting as a sandwich where the middle is just a third slice of white bread you got to cause some drama to keep the numbers high.
---
That would be the TBC beta server experience. Free level 60s fully geared to play with.
---
During leveling. Can't get bop's gifted.
---
But wouldn't the gnome also have way more armor which would reduce the damage,or would the shield alone make up for it?
---
Enjoy the addons and good luck progressing.
---
the 'no change clown brigade' has been playing serious private servers for 6 years or more now, hopping to a new fresh server from time to time. They will certainly not get burned out in classic, the only thing blizz has to do is  make a batch of new servers after naxx and they will be happy again.
---
A beautiful new element to classic, I don’t see much influence when servers are live there will be a much larger player base than beta
---
Simply put, the spot is basically overpowered. As a mage you can head there at 56 and those last 4 levels are so fast that you wouldn’t believe it. I can almost guarantee you that if this spot is reachable in Classic there’s gonna be created Mafia’s to control it. I’ve only farmed there on private servers, there was a bunch of low levels in the water wanting to leech xp, and if you didn’t invite them they had multiple hordes parked to kill you. And when you die you have to spirit ress. Then there’s the other mages who’s fucking up your pulls so you die and he can take over farming. I’ve even had an alliance mage make his horse rogue friend come kill me. 
---
And then the fact that you can level from 1-60 in 5 days /played fully afk in the water is the BIGGEST reason why I highly doubt it’s gonna be reachable.
---
Yeah, imagine all those plebs who want to reorganise their action bars or merge their bags into one...damn cheaters I'm telling ya.
---
I like the idea of changes but without anything related to the expansions. Boost the textures, boost the soundtracks, add the missing zones on the map and lvl 60 quest lines, no new dungeons, new RP elements. 
---
Never been the fan of the "keep adding raids" race that happened after classic.
---
Damn, can I get a 4k version of this? Anyone have the skills?
---
Awesome! Gl with the influx
---
If ur going for realm first. Your probably only going to have about 3 days, Your also going to be playing Hunter (or Warlock, I guess)
---
Better have a carton of 5 hour energy's and pre-planned meals. Might be able to get a hour or two of sleep a night. If competition doesn't seem to likely to catch you.
---
Its probably not worth it to be honest, at the very best people will remember you were first for about a week. Then everyone else that rushed will cap, and most people wont care anymore.
---
Not even that. Look at the difference I words used. Old-school vs classic. Old-school has a lot more give and leeway. Classic doesn’t. Add in that vanilla pservers have been around since TBC I really doubt we’ll only get a few months of life with classic.
---
Im pretty positive there wont be an open beta.
---
Wotlk was completely different, ive done both and can tell you the original nax was near impossible for most guilds. My guild which was the best on our server killed 3 bosses before tbc came out. A very very small number of people have killed the last few bosses.
---
Would appreciate it if you didn’t get all the fun exploits needed. Thx
---
Dude. You could have just played a frost mage. Get the rythem of Tab, 2, 2 ,2 2,22, tab, 2,2,2,2, and sit on one spot, till at some point, you saw the Graveyard angel!
---
Will there be a questhelper?
---
**Eminence** \[NA\] \[H\] \[PST\] is now recruiting for our hardcore Horde Classic Raiding guild! Here at Eminence we are all about preparation and organization to meet our classic wow goals! If you’re like us the hype levels are in overdrive and you’re busying yourself daily with everything possible to make sure you’re ready for classic already… so why not lock down a raid spot in a great community and progression-oriented guild too?
---
A little bit about Eminence? The guild is run by a smaller group Friends who have grown up gaming together along with a couple friends we’ve made along the way. All of us have high level experience across multiple games in addition to WoW, holding top percentile ranks in LoL, Overwatch, Halo, PoE, and others.
---
Eminence’s Officer core is extensively experienced in ALL of classic Vanilla Warcraft, both leading and clearing ALL content from release up to Naxx, as well as high US ranked clears of many tiers of retail WoW between WotLK and Legion. Currently members are still regularly active on pservers. Our discord is always active with people playing misc games and getting to know each other better while we build up our roster for launch!
---
Eminence will be using a EPGP based loot council loot system in order to provide the most fair and streamlined loot in raids.
---
**Recruitment: (Experienced and Dedicated Warriors Needed!)**
---
We are currently recruiting people who are looking to join a Hardcore Raiding Guild/Community and want to get on board early with us during our building phase going into classic! We are a guild who WILL be #1 on the realm we settle on once classic releases. We will be rolling on a PVP realm on the Horde side while aiming for a medium population server. We are looking for dedicated and prepared individuals or groups of people who share the same mindset towards WoW that we do.
---
What exactly are we talking about? Eminence is looking for focused, dedicated, and motivated individuals that have high raiding aspirations for classic and the knowledge and experience to join us on the path to achieving them. We take raiding seriously, including everything from consumables, pre-raid BiS, to min/maxing profs/builds/raid compositions, and everything in between.
---
Overall we are looking for people with DEDICATION and PASSION for classic wow and mastery of their class(es). Chances are if you’re in here reading and made it this far while on the hunt for your classic guild this early, you’re the type of person we’re looking for. A lack of high level experience isn’t a deal-breaker but it’s definitely an asset when applying. We are mainly looking for people with Hardcore Retail wow experience and/or people with Private Server Raiding Experience.
---
The goal is to build a tight-knit and reliable team of like-minded, committed individuals who want to put maximum effort forth clearing content on the cutting edge and establishing ourselves as a premiere raiding guild. If you are interested in applying or would like to learn more about us please visiteminenceclassic.enjin com
---
We are looking for dedicated Tanks especially, all people of skill should apply (through discord). We are 40+ members strong!
---
**Raid days and times** (subject to minor changes)
---
Tuesday - 6:00-9:30pm PST
---
Wednesday- 6:00-9:30 PST
---
Sunday - 6:00-9:30 PST (cleanup day/ Onyxia if not weekly resets)
---
For more information you can add me or one of my recruitment officers on discord, we would love to chat!

Redrick#9438
---
How would you even implement such a thing? Ban people if they stream on certain servers? It's 2019, this is the way the world works now. We have to adapt and stop living in the past.
---
Nah, he's stated he plans on sleeping. He will likely set a bunch of /played records, but account sharing and people going without sleep will hit 60 first.
---
damn that sucks was kinda hoping most people forgot it existed haha
---
Exactly. I like Anduin just fine but he should be learning from his elders. Him leading the Alliance forces rather than people with thousands of years of experience makes no sense.
---
Not saying raiding is bad, its just totally different game inside MMO. It Would be ok if Blizzard added some things in open world for ppl who want to play MMO, but instead they put all best items into raids and high pvp ranks, leaving mmo crowd with possiblity to farm gold or create another character.
---
Yeah he did definatly say that he could be a leaching bi.. in the Beta
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/OnerousWittyMageCoolStoryBro
---
I'm not arguing that if we change it it's not the same. I'm arguing that there's no good reason to be against change just because
---
Meh. I'm hoping enough addons from the original CaithUI are updated for classic so I can just recreate that.
---
Does it share resources with retail?
---
I wholeheartedly agree with you. It could be enforced easily by Blizzard literally making it an offence worthy of having your account banned if you're caught streaming on a dedicated streamer-less server. Vanilla wasn't designed with streamers in mind.
---
thanks for posting. i enjoyed that a lot.
---
Oh complete bollocks, streamers in the past  received beta when they received it. There were even popular method streamers that could not stream beta's from day one seeing as your example is raiding related. 
---
 I cannot comment on the website side of things but there is a difference to people writing content or making published content than twitch streamers.  Blizzard have to adapt with the times, but there  was  better ways to implement this without making players feeling excluded to this unfair degree. I would love to be able to play with more of you for more than a stress test. that is what classic is about and the beta should imo embrace that.
---
My point incase vague is that we should be worried about the direction Blizzard constantly makes in its decisions recently.
---
That would be absolutely wildly hard to implement and police.
---
That sounds like alot of fun!
---
Great idea indeed!
---
Split phase 1 up to the 19, 29 etc. brackets. Everyone in twink bis before the next phase :-D
---
...would be terrible for speeders, tho.
---
I am not concluding with anything, I am just uncertain if it is the correct values or not.
---
If you could set up your own character and simulate the gnome (like if it was an actual beta) you could figure out easily, but since you can't you just have to assume.
---
Obviously the stances + shield should make a difference, but the gnome is also like 17 levels higher and very well geared, so would there be a significant armor difference?
---
No sure why you were downvoted...you're basically saying the truth.
---
His viewership will not stay solid months after release, through countless WSG matches, day in and day out. His fan base is not really aligned with Classic, as a whole.
---
I think people here are seriously mis-remembering the R14 grind. It was absolutely brutal, and will actually be moreso this time around if a large amount of streamers are set against each other.
---
The grind was so brutal that many large pvp guilds actually set aside differences to create a friggin' queue where they decided week by week who got the R14 next. And even *then* it required immense grinding by that person and his/her premade.
---
I'm really hoping they have RPPVP servers at launch.
---
I just hope you can still get into hyjal and aq. And I saw someone visiting the maelstrom loooong ago in vanilla but no idea how you even get there.
---
I disagree. I see tons of people everyday talking about "What if the classes were balanced so I could play Prot Pally" or "Can we get options for updated models" or "Cows are ugly why can't Trolls be Druids" etc.
---
I think that if you let the player base choose and vote what features get brought into the game, its gonna ruin the game.
---
Hi, /u/Metr0xBOOMIN
---
The most important thing is to choose a class that you think you'll enjoy.
---
The game was build with casual people as the focus.
---
still disappointed they removed the skeleton in the final version of hyjal...
---
I tried watching some streamer content because I was interested in the beta. Sodapoppin was alright, just a little high and mighty. I then watch asmongold and I was shocked at how little he knew the game. His chat was full of people shouting at him that he had missed something and I felt like 90% of players were more competent than him. Now that’s fine if that person owns it, which he did to a certain extent, but the rest of the time he was really arrogant and it was offputting.  
---
Looking for a streamer that has some charisma but Ismaily just not stuck up.
---
If you’re worried about time commitments the only thing you can really do to help yourself is play a tank or play with someone who will tank.
---
I’m sure in time it will be possible to do dungeons and even raids. It’s more the amount of time it takes you to get there with what you can commit. 
---
Top tier raiding guild with 2 hours a day if that? Probably not. Casual raiding guild with some pvp sprinkled in. Sure can.
---
Haha it does suck, would’ve loved to go there and farm myself! But it’s safe to say it’s the best for the game if the spot isn’t gonna be a thing :)
---
No problem!
---
I've got a dream of clipping certain major milestones on my way to 60 to make a sweet montage out of, kind of a "rags to riches" style montage. I've got an outline of some of the major things I want to make sure I can clip. The Nvidia "shadowplay" is pretty cool, and I've had some moderately positive experiences using the Windows built in recording, but haven't really done any video editting in a long time. 
---
Best of luck out there!
---
Prolly play a pve server
---
It's not. The way walking animations interact with speed is wrong. Pretty noticeable in stealth, but also during sprint or speedpots
---
You're attempting to turn this around on me, somehow, and failing hard. You want changes. Blizzard specifically said they wouldn't entertain any changes. I don't know why you think "everything is up for negotiation," as if that were a real thing.
---
this... go to wotlk then STOP
---
Hey Petrolsk, I’ll see if I can test that out later today.
---
&gt; yeah I actually think this is a battle between the people from retail  and the people who actually have the memories from vanilla.  
---
LOL. People played with tons of addons in classic. Fucking healbot back then was an actual healbot that auto healed the lowest target. Not that this is the best choice of healing, but that's not the point. Decursive, insane macros and more. There's nothing about current addons.
---
I mean, tbc and wotlk are different games. It's a valid path forward but it's not "forever vanilla".
---
I thought about ladder resets/seasons too, but I wonder if that format really works for wow. In Diablo 2 people clear everything in the game a day after reset... D3 is not that much slower. Wow is a time investment. I think I'd lose motivation if I knew my shit was going away.
---
I really hope they find a solution, but as it stands I think the playerbase will fall off after a few years, and it will then be borderline impossible go play the game, because good luck putting together groups and raids without a playerbase.
---
I mean, if the game has a two year (or whatever) lifespan and then that's that, that's still a lot of game to play, but it does have one foot in the grave from the start.
---
Don't get me wrong, pumped for classic, I just think you're being way too optimistic.
---
It won't be on the same level as streamers today.
---
Raiding is part of the MMO, you join a guild and you seek out the high lvl gear with them. 
---
Are you bothered that the gear is behind an instance, like every big piece of gear in the game is when leveling?
---
id honestly suggest mage warlock, or mage mage would be fun.
---
paladin warlock the paladin is essentially a voidwalker that can also replace his life and buff him.
---
2 caster dps should just blow stuff away fast 
---
the mage provides food and cc the lock brings the pets 
---
even if you pull 3 mobs mage can sheep one and you can dps the other 2 down even without pets
---
i just feel casters carry their weight better leveling , paladin / lock the lock is going to be doing most of the work (which is not nesicarily bad the paladan can enable him to just keep pulling)
---
Immersion please
---
Ahhhh TitanBar, how I don’t miss you.
---
https://youtu.be/IsiJ__WyRNk?t=284 On this clip he  doesn't have devotion aura, he is using the thorns aura ( I don't remember what its called).
---
I don't know what Asmon's armor value is, or the gnomes value is, but it should be somewhat significant even with the shield, as the gnome is like 16-17  levels higher and almost BIS geared
---
I mean it would take a silly amount of resources to police.
---
Please stop responding. To everyone. This just shows how little you know about MMOs, and WoW in general. BFA raiding is not even in the same ballpark as vanilla raiding.
---
I think levels 1-25 could use layering, and then remove it for any zone past that.
---
And the Kobold mine you have to go to at like level 5
---
Oh i never knew that, saves you having to drown yourself in that pool of water, whoops TIL.
---
Shields have a lot of armor on them. The gnome is still wearing mail. With all the armor asmongold is rocking and the fact that he's actually setup for tanking it's entirely possible that he would take less damage than someone 17 levels above him.
---
They can if they block the Chat API.
---
Ah ok, you just phrased it a bit weird but I get it :)
---
And I don't remember, I didn't play mage back then. But there should be a lot of mage videos in 1.12 so we should be able to find out which one is correct
---
Im not that hardcore, keep that in mind. Softcore player here. Will probably hit 60 in 1-2 month
---
Level caps are the reason for every mmo getting boring. There shouldn’t be an ‘end game’ the whole game should be The Game.
---
My way around it is to just pvp instead of pve.
---
We reaching mainstream numbers now bois.
---
I’d imagine it’s the same at 60 as it is at 1.
---
Do classes not get the same stat, hp and mana each level?
---
Explain, I don't see just taking down all streams from x servers unless permission granted, which it can never likely be
---
17 levels difference (something like that), there doesn't seem to be devotion aura, and the armor values should be significantly different unless the shield makes up for it.
---
soda seems to think that speccing feral is literally the worst thing to do for druid pvp from what I've heard.
---
Interesting.  I figured behind the scenes it would be treated as an exceptional momentary target swap.
---
You plan on capping at day 5 or 6? I have monday night and 6 days dedicated to leveling. I’m not going to realm first but by all means i’m trying to level 1-60 as fast as possible. I plan on getting around 4 hours of sleep. I’m leveling an undead rogue, I’ve done vanilla content 20+ times and have had max level every alt so I have a good idea of all the questing zones. You think it’s possible for me to get 60 with 1 night and 6 days dedicated for leveling?
---
Cant wait to see those BFA champs getting rekt by average 1.12 players. Literally any decent 1.12 player shits on streamers like venruki, asmon, or payo.
---
I'm happy your therapy sessions are teaching you something. Keep up with them, you'll be on the mend in no time.
---
The damage is fine. Guys, stop trying to recreate the difficulty from memory or from private servers. Neither are accurate by any means.
---
yeah guys one patch you have swimming upwards and the next patch you have raid finder /s
---
Yup. That would break most legitimate addons in the process. That's not going to happen.
---
Waaa grtz
---
Seems like a lot of the people who complain about streamers tend to like Crendor, Mad Season, all the chill guys. 
---
Theres no reason to argue about it, it's just different forms of entertainment. You watch Asmon for a laugh, or Crendor to just chill out and have a good time.
---
you mean 800 x 590.  Titan Bar wasting the top of the screen.
---
Conveniently didn't show the first few fights where he would run in and get 3 shotted hahaha.
---
So basically you want Blizzard to do what you want to do and if they don't you'll bitch at other people.
---
I love pvp as well, and I'll probably hank everyone nonstop as well. But this guy is just something else man. I can't imagine what happened that made someone so hateful.
---
nice
---
No worries. No need to turn it around. You never had it.   
---
Youre speaking from a very angry and confident place.   
---
You don't need to respond anymore.   
---
If the movement happens, you won't be able to stop it.
---
It's an extremely good addon (it has some obvious flaws with its default settings, but other than that it's great and I've been using it for a long time).
---
But that doesn't change the fact it was made as a "vanilla copy" of ElvUI, which is far superior in many ways.
---
Yup! Me too!
---
I'm not on the hate train on streamers. But hell, I'd love it if all the streamers congregated in one single realm in their respective regions. It'd result in so much fun content for everyone to watch.
---
That’s insane! I remember when this was at 10k
---
I would say as I am seeing from a few retail converts in the beta. The extra complexity doesn't matter and isn't missed when it's gone. The only people that care about rotation are "epeen" measures who just want a way to display their mastery over the class. Not hating on that but, it's a very small percentage of the game. Most people will enjoy the simplified fast paced combat. I know I do.
---
the test on the beta was a relatively flat surface, and my marks are estimates not exact :P If you look at the more recent image [here](https://imgur.com/a/xBR9g2g) you can see the terrain markers a little bit better. Again my lines aren't exact, and the zoom factor of the right picture is a little bit more since I was taking snips instead of the full 4k ss. I did mention that the PvP video was easily chalked up to lag, but I wanted to make not at how quick you go from melee to auto range. It's literally .1-.2 sec at most
---
Wow...a business making a business-smart decision. 
---
Here's the thing though man...it's not like they gave *your* beta key away to a streamer. They haven't hard capped the servers. They're releasing keys in waves, at a rough targeted figure.
---
Described in a simpler way...it's likely that the keys given to streamers are extra and above the targeted amount they sent randomly. You didn't miss yours because they got theirs.
---
When did you make your wow acc?
---
Hahah what a lame attempt at a jab, you can do better

would be interesting, my gear though was away from my fully equipped paladin.
---
My hunter had some equipment left though
---
This is just a part of gaming now, it doesn't have to be a big deal, just wait and see where most of the streamers are and go to another server. A lot of streamers will play together for cross promotion. It's not really blizzards fault that the world has changed since 2004. It's got pros and cons, there won't be the lag of 04 but the dynamic between players will be different partially because of streamers and partially because there are player that have never played and players that played back in 04. I understand your frustrations but there are ways to avoid the biggest streamers without Blizzard having to basically ban them.
---
APES isn’t a sperg guild, they’re likely the best guild in pserver scene based on track record
---
Berserker vs Defensive Stance
---
Instanced content is not MMO. 5 Mans during leveling are optional, and do not block your character progression, if you dont do them.
---
I misunderstood you, I thought you meant upgrade vanilla to tbc but you're talking about releasing a new server altogether.
---
Pretty sure the world record is 4 days 20 hrsish
---
I got 7 days free gaming time :) also super happy with it! Really nice...
---
I directly subscribed for more to hopefully get a beta invite :)   (stress tests would be fine also)
---
I was gonna meme about getting something too... dissapointment... but you made me check.
---

---
Stop getting upset over a meme
---
im conflicted if i want to keep leveling in beta
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
The last triple A mmo I beta’d did it that way with stress tests. An invite to one got you invited to all future stress tests and allowed you to beta test as well. They didn’t revoke beta access after stress tests.
---
I have two connected to my battle.net id. One account is my day 1 US account, the second is my day 1 EU account.
---
I was in the original beta like 15 years ago so it's been a while :P
---
The question isn't about whether it existed, it is about whether it is correct. Initially I was thinking it felt like 3-8 yards instead of the stated 5-8 yards. However, the newest theory here is that it is actually 10-11 yards instead of 8 yards for some reason.
---
NE rogue named Fyrestar. You?
---
They were under NDA then. MoP was my first beta I ever got invited to and everyone was streaming that on day one since there was no NDA. Blizzard also let everyone in that beta if you subscribed for a year (I wasn't one of them) and it was a shitshow at the beginning because of that. Ever since then, every beta has people claiming they deserve an invite. 
---
This phase is very limited as it's restricted to level 30. Yes, the true meaning of classic is the community, but we aren't testing the community. We're testing the actual game play. Some people are legitimately testing things despite what you see on popular livestreams.
---
[He's using it in stockade](https://imgur.com/1HUf9Y5), which is an accurate comparison vs the gnome in stockade.
---
His armor, that I saw in an earlier clip was 1240, so with Devo it's 1630.
---
1630 armor vs 1750, not that different, about 1% damage reduction vs level ~25 mobs.
---
As long as you beat the mob out of Tirisfal yes, the biggest thing you need is to not be stuck in barrens or silverpine with a mob of people.
---
For instance, I'm leveling a Spriest first. I've run the 1-10 for it about 7 times, I got my 1-10 just mob griding (in my experience the fastest way) to 2 hours and 11 minutes. Though I'll need a wand asap to make that happen.
---
Oh man, this shit writes itself. Keep going.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ImpartialDelightfulCaribouHotPokket
---
There is no way you could breeze through this boss in this manner so easily in Vanilla.
---
Private servers wouldn't have been around for so long if the interest hasn't stayed around for this long.  It's pretty timeless, just like when you boot up donkey kong country on SNES just to play it again or super mario bros on NES.  It may very well be a game played for as long as blizzards around and even then we have private servers to fall back to again.
---
Yay, congrats!
---
none of them will see this lol
---
dunno about all that. I'd just love to get into the beta :P
---
Poor Pserver players...should be put on suicide watch after they read this. I mean, they didn't have fun for like 10 years now.
---
In the end, it's yet another "pls changes" thread. Thanks for telling me what i want.
---
I was here POG
---
Mn did it with a party of 5.
---
Berserker stance on the Gnome. Berserker stance causes you to take extra damage.
---
Noone knows yet.
---
Only official statement we have is devs are open to TBC and WoTLK if Classic is successful but no details about how it'll work, no guarantees it'll happen either.
---
40-person content is most definitely MMO, especially when you factor in the amount of prep in the overworld required to do them. Not sure what else to say.
---
You going to use the actual WoW team that made it or no?
---
And I'm sad again :(
---
Im having this same confusion too. I dont know if I'm considered an 'OG' player or not because the account I have gametime on is from 2017, but I have WoW licenses created in 05/06 on my account which are not currently subscribed.
---
People have been playing vanilla wow for 15 years. Doubtless it will get stale for some, but there's a hell of a lot of replayability there in the base content. I think all of really needs is a sort of ladder system with regular server restarts to keep  people interested.
---
Lol, the ending with the BFA logo... “bruh...”
---
I stopped playing probably like, 3 years ago, and even then there was the huge problem with healers not dying and never going oom. It was ridiculous and made pvp really unenjoyable.
---
I cannot wait. I haven't heard "ANOTHER FALLS" in years.
---
Obviously there is some small% of crowd happy for raiding I do not denny this.
---
&gt; Why not both?
---
When you have "both" on the table, you often end up with the issue of players who feel demotivated to keep on trying to beat hard bosses because the next items aren't much of an upgrade.
---
Genuinely curious. How do you know he hasn't played since vanilla?
---
Who threw fireball??
---
Lol I dunno I wasn't exactly in my right state of mind when I wrote that.
---
Great meme!
---
I personally think an undergeared priest struggles, less? With less healing gear. Could be wrong.
---
I WANT TO DANG IT
---
You can drop enchanting after getting the trinket too. It’s just needed to craft not equip or use like engi.
---
Yeah there are still things to do after 3 whole days.
---
God I want to be in the beta so bad
---
We definitely need to bring this to light, so report this as a bug! I know that on BFA it helps to macro in petattack in every skill to help with the delay.
---
Definitely no Boomkin, ele shaman, prot Pally, melee huntard or only feral cat dps. All those of specs dont work at all. 
---
Ele shamans and boomkin - Most of the mobs and a fair amount of the bosses in MC are either immune to nature damage or have a high resistance to it. Same with BWL to a lesser extent. Combine that with horrendous mana sustain even with chain chugging mana pots and demonic runes makes them not viable at all. 
---
Melee huntard - one second...HAHAHAHAHA!!!  Ok but seriously...HAHAHAHAHA!!! Dammit, I cant stop laughing. Fuck, hold on...ok they have 1 niche they can hold as wingclip Nightfall user but my God the "dps" will be God awful terrible
---
Cat feral dps only - seriously, if someone wants to do this just tell them to play rogue. Feral dps isnt completely terrible in MC but falls off a cliff once people get T2 gear and weapons. Feral definitely has a place in raids as a OT. Just not as dps only
---
Prot Pally - absolutely not. Everything about it doesnt support raiding from spec to itemization. You could get away with one as an OT but your raid group would have to out gear the raid by a fair margin. 
---
As for Ret Pally, shadow priest and feral druid OT. These actually can work in a 40 man though the amount of work they have to put in to earn that raid spot is FAR greater than that put in by anyone else. Shadow priests have to chain chug mana pots and demonic runes making it VERY expensive to raid. Feral druid OT has to do a fair bit of farming prior to raiding for a variety of sets they will have to bring. Same for Ret Pally to a slightly lesser degree. All 3 must know their toolkit inside and out and be willing to use it when necessary. Absolutely mandatory they be flasked at all times
---
Yes it's the same animation, both for stealth and speed pots. It's just played back at a different speed.
---
Preparation is MMO, instanced raids are not, just like fortnite is not a MMO.
---
I’m not sure, that’s what I’m trying to confirm.
---
Real hard to implement that.  Supposing you got all the current streamers on select servers, you'll still have no way to predict just who will decide to turn on a camera and make it big next. Much easier just to do your own research on if any big names are on your prospective server.
---
April 2005 and no invite. Anyone else that isn't a streamer/F+F from that same time period that has gotten in randomly? I've only seen OG beta testers/late 04'ers confirmed to get in so far.
---
I mean I know it is more likely that they just passed me over, because fuck me, but I'm still curious.
---
In 5 mans 1 isnt prefered over the other
---
In raiding you only need 4 or 5 paladins and 5 priests
---
Then you shouldn't play classic and stay with retail, honestly thats the reason I dont like retail its to easy, there are  4 pieces of each item. I miss classic and tbc and wotlk because you know who was high end, people knew item names and were in aw by them.
---
Was in the EU beta for WoW 15 years ago too. So a long time.
---
Can not use pots in form. Have to shift out. Can gather in form though so that’s nice.
---
Echo Isles were in the game from the beginning, they just weren't an actual starting zone until Cata.  Experience bar replacement addons have always shown spillover xp at level cap.
---
&gt;So I was just assuming min range is 8 yards from the center of the target, but now that I think about it, if that was the case, then on huge bosses like Ragnaros, wouldn't Hunters be able to shoot virtually in melee range? But they can't, right?
---
Correct, they can't. Azuregos is easier to find material on, since he teleports people on top of him, and here you go: [[Vanilla](https://youtu.be/3eQUmutcOz4?t=142), look at range indicators when he turns][[TBC](https://youtu.be/O9Y1BITG940?t=59)]
---
&gt;So on second thought, perhaps the formula changed a little bit from pre-Cataclysm to that one with Cataclysm when they removed the min range from Hunters? Huh, and if the min range is being applied like you're suggesting, that would actually explain what we're saying. Hm! But then how did pre-Cataclysm handle Hunter min range? Strange.
---
It seems to me that evidence points to vanilla using the same range formulae that you quoted. I don't see why those would have changed when the minimum range was removed.
---
Probably why literally no game does this
---
My account was created, the day my store started giving out pre-order kits in EU, converted to a bnet account way before it was mandatory and I just got in now as well.
---
it was a choice. addons were optional, and you could pick the ones you wanted.
---
unlike retail, where many of the addon functionality (and much more) is stuffed down your throat , like it or not.
---
Play to 30 on the faction you wont main when it comes out. The quests and zones until lvl 30 are almost entirely different for the 2 factions. As alliance you miss out on the barrens/silverpine. Horde misses out big time on darkshore!
---
Nope, not me sorry :)
---
Arms warrior has three weapons or so that are better than sulfuraa and easier to obtain - priority chain of usefulness would go shaman &gt; paladin &gt; warrior
---
Yes but blizzard focus mostly on new raids, leveling during each expansion is more like tutorial to raiding.
---
This is kind of sad that people feel so alone they seek out human interaction with a streamer who doesn't give two fucks about them.
---
For the longest time I thought it was the dwarf shooting it until one day I noticed the mage behind him
---
If they capped BfA at level 113 people would be DONE with the game in 2 hours...
---
I've got the disappointment right here, no worries.
---
Pm’d you
---
Have you considered druid?
---
Perfectly fine tanks for 5-man dungeons
---
Significantly faster levelers than warriors
---
*Even better* at forming fast 5-mans, since with HotW spec and healing gear you can heal, dps, or tank; filling whatever role you are waiting on
---
Still fine at casual raiding, since everyone needs healers, and you could potentially off tank if you put the time in to get geared/MCP
---
If I wasn't going to try hard for raiding, I'd probably be maining a druid. Dungeons are a blast and druids are the kings of 5-mans.
---
You’re welcome. I’m glad you’re finding it useful. It’s been a lot of work, but I’m happy with the results so far. Hopefully higher level quests start giving me spillover rep, as that was a primary reason for making the guide.
---
Gratz! Ding!
---
&gt;Second, need to check if everyone in that video has 'given permission' to be recorded. How do you check that? Is there some kind of permission form everyone in the video must fill out?
---
The steamer would have to provide this not blizzard.
---
&gt; What if me and a friend (who gives permission) are recording a video and some random player runs by on their mount. Do I need to get permission from them now? Is my video now unable to be uploaded because a random player ran by? 
---
Yes, because thats what makes this nearly impossible to bypass. The idea is to have a few safe havens not force the whole community to do this. You can upload the video and it may stay up forever, but if someone reports it to blizz then they should have all rights to take it down at that point.
---
Grats on your invite. I'm super jealous. Does it just pop up as a dropdown option on the bnet launcher?
---
Give them a month to catch up to the meta and Venruki will be stomping private servers boomers. Asmon is dogshit so obviously he will get pk'd
---
Grtzz, still no Beta here.
---
My “OG” account from Jan 2005 doesn’t have game time and didn’t get an invite.
---
My account with a current subscription is from June 2006 and also didn’t get an invite.  LOL
---
Fuckin McConnel.
---
I don't think Asmongold had the time of his life. It was clear early on that it was interesting, but it quickly became annoying for both Asmongold and his chat. Yes, this is a meme, but it doesn't exactly fit.
---
Yep, I think by default it's set to "pause" when you have something open in full screen. No impact on game performance as a result.
---
Just take the portals that are in every major city /s
---
I thought I was going crazy. I've been trying to reproduce this thinking it was my /petattack macro. I'll report it as well later tonight.
---
Hia strean was prtty fun today. He watched some of his old videos and gave tons of context. Was really great
---
Apparently Esfand believes he's the only NA player to play private servers and he wants everyone to know that, constantly
---
Védjuk meg a szerverünket a betolakodó kannibál hordáktól!
---
Can someone link me that other bait that Esfand did on the boat please? I laughed my ass off with that one.
---
You can run from dun morogh through the mountains and die in wetlands which will let you spirit Rez at menethil. That is how I would run to darn at level 1.
---
Yep, just a dropdown. I just checked randomly.
---
Yah that doesn't seem right I clearly remember them just getting out of melee range and doing that crap. But the real question is what is the range for range weapons to be used. It really didn't matter shattershot + brack cc wingclip flowed by ice trap a few yards out, and then setup for the aimshot boom took care of people prepping for it.
---
Ah man. That makes me so depressed. I wanna join too x)
---
Possibly my favorite part of all this is Preach having to slowly give in to the fact that he's having a lot of fun with Classic.
---
Priest probably, but paladins might scale better if they are better geared, as they get that sweet 100% mana refund on every crit heal which is really fucking strong in vanilla.
---
Both have good utility, both are good healers (and they are only healers in PvE).So I would say its about the same, but I would assume paladins are more popular than priests.
---
I was expecting a better comeback considering your previous comment.
---
Was expecting better from a pvp player who apparently plays wow on hard mode.
---
Yep, it did. I remember waiting for the tick of a dot to start cannibalizing to try to time a second tick of cannibalism before the next dot tick and/or avoid getting interrupted right away.
---
Jesus Christ give this man a medal of honor, absolute hero lol he won that fight for them singlehandedly
---
Hello Gallows' End Tavern! First rounds on me boys.
---
I'm curious if there's going to be a GearScore add-on, and of so, if Blizz would break it. They didn't in WOTLK when it was dominate for getting into any pug, and eventually added it to the game, along with gear requirements for LFG/LFD/LFR. 
---
I don't want it. But I can easily see this being used: "LF1M don't bother applying if your gear score is less than "XYZ""
---
It always happens in all versions of the game, including back in vanilla, some Add-on will get embraced by elitists, and it trickles down to everyone, because you stop being able to compete or find groups outside of guild or friend groups. 
---
Just curious how Blizz will act, but more importantly how quickly they'll act. Breaking a gear score add-on after it's dominate and required just means it will go to a Mr Robot site that you'll have to put your profile in so people can inspect you before inviting you, and then it's still a requirement, but less convenient because it's not in-game. 
---
No real easy answer here.
---
I haven't seen anyone who says they know they are added to the F&amp;F list getting in yet. It seems delayed for F&amp;F.
---
lol, it most definitely **did** happen, as I witnessed it first hand back then. 
---
The hunters working against you would just wait until your party pulled and distracting shot right away before the tank built threat. That alone could cause enough chaos off the bat to botch the attempt. Additionally, if the tank happened to get hit by a sleep cloud it created the opportunity for a hunter to pull aggro with distracting shot.
---
I could be mis-remembering this bit, but I think the dragons may have also been immune to taunt effects, so if someone were able to get aggro it could be a challenge to get it back under control.
---
both are great healers
---
i personally prefer holy paladins there is just something about wearing a shield and plate and throwing out big heals that turns me on
---
the priest on the other hand has a viable caster dps build you can do stuff with
---
id just pick by the off spec you like the idea of most tbh 
---
i have no desire to ret or prot paladin play so i should prob go priest but ill prob still go paladin just because i like the class fantasy
---
You would think that if they were going to make a sweeping change to nerf all, or a good chunk, of the mobs in the game that it would be mentioned in the patch notes rather than go undocumented, even if it is just general terms.  
---
And yes, their goal is to recreate the vanilla experience, however a lot of people disagree on just what that means. Simplest solution is to pick a patch and stick with it.
---
Yeah, I'm in pretty much the same boat. Opened up a ticket to try and get clarification, but Blizzard CS wouldn't confirm or deny the way it worked.
---
If your talking in generalizations, he’s right. At least, back in Vanilla, a *large* number of subs never reached 60, let alone raised, let alone made it past MC. That number, out of the 7M or so Vanilla got, is mostly people that didn’t raid much. 
---
But that’s not to say those people didn’t *want* to raid, also. But Classic really is geared to casuals, more than the modern game which is 2% leveling and 98% max level content.
---
I plan on raiding myself, but I understand that I, and most of us here, are in the minority. Then again, the % of people that make it into MC will probably be higher this time around, with more knowledge.
---
Or better idea, don't play on release. Just browse twitch and write every server with a streamer over 1k views. Don't go to those servers. It's that easy.
---
The way it's on the beta now is how it's on live. It was different in vanilla.
---
My account is from 04 and I am not in as well so, its just RNG
---
how could I play without constantly knowing at a glance how much gold I had? iirc the most important function of it for me was actually the clock
---
Maybe going full into it yeah, but feral is in no way bad at PvP.
---
They're great for World PvP and dueling.
---
Arenas? I have no idea as they weren't my cup of tea.
---
I'm a new so don't kill me, but what harm do streamers do to servers?
---
Hell no it doesn't work that way
---
Thanks. I kinda thought so too. Considering I'll be spending a decent amount of time doing dungeons for my pre raid BiS, it's something that worries me (to a degree). If Paladins are too gear dependent then it would make my choice a lot easier.
---
Will you believe that I am glad I don;t have beta access?  I have no time to play now anyway and I don;t mind the fact that others can play. I will be playing classic, but it's a bit of a relief that it is still 3 months away so I can make sure I am ready for it.
---
They're at least leading their respective raids, I feel like they deserve some credit
---
I'm not saying they won't have servers with additional content. I'm definitely saying that some servers will be moving directly to burning Crusade.
---
The fact that many of us will not see, or as you strangely put it get past, naxxramas, is 100% irrelevant.
---
You’re not alone. I’m thinking if I save X more dollars I can take a leave of absence for Y time from work lol. Already planning to take 3-5 days of PTO but it doesn’t seem like enough.
---
On a CRT too.
---
Is it just EU or can NA confirm that they just got an invite? 
---
Would be interesting to know if waves are region specific.
---
Pvp warfront could have been legit amazing.
---
OPs last video from WOD shows it is fine. If OP could upload a video from current WOW which has similar delays, it would definitely clear up things for people like me that aren’t subscribed.
---
No changes reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Of course pvp  can be considered as infinite content, but If You ignore honor farming inside battlegrounds You might end as free kill for better geared player.
---
2005 EU account, r12 during vanilla, still no invite :((   
---
blizz pretty pleaseeeeeee
---
Didn't get it :(
---
But I am also not subbed to BFA
---
I raided super hardcore for 7-8 years and when times got bad on retail I went to pservers and played 19-29 twinks. It’s funny watching all of them pimp out their 30s and have fun doing it. Lot of people don’t realize how many small communities there are in wow and how much great gameplay falls inside of them. Met hundreds of great people and played tons of tourneys etc on 19s/29s. I urge everyone to have a low level alt to mess around on when you have free time, can be a lot of fun!
---
&gt; To me this is a clear sign that the quality of game development is going backwards. 
---
No offense, but this is kind of nonsense. The quality of games has massively improved over the years. What you are seeing instead is that as gaming as grown, the largest companies have focused on more mainstream games, and along with that comes more mainstream game design.
---
The problem with MMOs is that they are hugely expensive games that require both a huge amount of development to release, and then a huge amount of ongoing development to maintain. A huge company like Blizzard isn't going to try to release an MMO that targets a more niche community like Classic is.
---
As pumped as I am about Classic, if an unknown company released a very similar but unknown game with similar mechanics, do you think it would be able to compete in today's market? To the point where a large AAA company would be happy with numbers of players it would attract? I'm not so sure.
---
I mean...you're not wrong
---
I’d like to see them come up with a new IP entirely. As much fun as I’ve had in Azeroth, it’s been fifteen years. It’s time for something completely different.
---
I would have liked to see Overwatch The MMO. It looked interesting, and the lore is fascinating.
---
Man, that image brings the feels back big time.
---
That's a bloody shame .
---
Fortnight by definition is an MMO. *Massive multi player*, it 100% fulfills that requirement. MMORPG? No, but that's because it has zero RPG elements to it.
---
Instanced content doesn't make a game suddenly not an MMO anymore...
---
I still don’t understand why people watch streamers...you’re watching someone talk while playing a video game.  If you have the time to watch it why not play it instead?
---
I appreciate YouTube video guides for quests etc. but I am dumbfounded how many people watch a dude playing a game they own themselves.
---
Look man. I know we are here to celebrate the old times and what Not, but it's 2019 now. You really need to get over streamers existing.
---
Just wait a few days and roll on the server that no streamers are on.
---
What an absolutely asinine request.
---
What do you mean undergreared?  Like questing blues/greens?  Or do you mean you're trying to heal in your str/Stam ret gear?
---
Neither class struggles to heal with gear that gives them int/spirit/mp5/healing power.
---
Holy priests will be slightly more effectiv than holy paladins if both are in poverty gear.  But paladins in BIS gear will be far more efficient than priests.
---
We got space for more. Just wait :)
---
Yeah you’re off a bit, BFA is a single player game with chore-like content.
---
The problem with WoW for me is that nothing matters, guilds/social interaction don't matter because you can raid without either. Gear doesn't matter because it becomes completely useless every few months. Questing has actually gotten a bit better over the years, but it's always just a few hours of content.
---
I think what people get confused about with pvp servers. Is that it is not about whether or not you like pvp. Almost everyone likes pvp. It's about whether or not you like pvp without consent. The consent thing is the relevant part. Not the pvp.
---
For me the pvp without consent adds a menace and a danger to the world that isn't there on a pvp server. Theres no thrill of stalking prey. No fear of being stalked. Everything tends to go as planned on a pve server. I find that as boring as you find the ganking frustrating. It's all down to the consent. Not the pvp though. Everyone love pvp.
---
Joana's gonna get it so good luck buddy :P
---
I'd like to pre-download as well but it doesn't seem like there is any option to. My internet is so shit, the stress test will be more like a day and a half if I'm lucky.
---
&gt;I get you won't be buying them through classic, but can you redeem your already existing tokens to play classic?
---
You should be able to as classic and retail shares the same subscription, so if you buy gametime on BFA it should also cover for classic
---
Damn congrats fellers
---
Retail and classic subscription is the same so you only have to pay 1 sub to play either. So yes you can buy game time with tokens and play Classic.
---
Same. From EU. Played original beta. No email just option in the client.
---
If you believe this beta launch was handled correctly, optimally and fairly. Kudos to you. 
---
With blizzards resources there are numerous ways to include everyone.  If this was all about testing the gameplay then why purposefully prio invite streamers.  End of the day irrespective of the past, this beta excludes players who want to take part and forces them to experience it through watching someones stream.
---
It leaves a terrible taste in my mouth, I wish you all the best of luck getting in &lt;3
---
Expiration date? Says who?
---
Bro 30 is not old nor are you a boomer. Boomers are 45+
---
Ok, now tell us dishonestly
---
Games in general become oversaturated by lots of devs, same with Fortnite for example. So many people I talk to also say they stopped playing after it got drowned with crazy features, and even pros have started leaving because of how rapidly it just changes into a different game.
---
Won't bother, already done it the first time around.
---
Doing Gods work.
---
Yes, you can redeem tokens from retail to "play Classic". It's a free addition to the main subscription, so whatever gives subscription time for retail does the same for Classic.
---
Nope it's the opposite. Anything before the not in the current patch is not worth doing. Blizzard is averse to making content relevant through several patches. This results in nothing you do mattering because if you fall behind you just catch up by doing current content.
---
Paladins will be more in demand. My reasoning is that most people will probably quit at level 25-30 after realizing how slow and painful they are to level. Priests at least have shadowform whilst leveling. Again, it's just an assumption but it's something to consider because not everyone will enjoy auto-attacking to victory.
---
I had no notification, nor any email. Saw this thread, checked my launcher, and have indeed gotten in.

Active subscription since:  Last Friday

---
im going to be playing night elf because its also something in ever normally play (plus highest base agility come on!)
---
yeah i'm EU :) ely is indeed a private server (LH now) and quite a few of our guild are returning.  when classic was announced most of us stepped away from wow to do other things and refresh ourselves but we're BACK BABY
---
its cool that you have people from back in teh day!  i have 1 RL friend that i used to play with in vanilla and he knows a few of our old guildies but they probably wont be playing with us
---
its a small world though eh!
---
EVERY expansion besides vanilla has just introduced too many QoL changes, and automated system that makes the game faster to play, and require way less interaction.
---
Vanilla WoW is the only wow version that feels like a 'real' virtual world, and as soon as TBC lands(which I hope it doesn') all of that goes down the drain.
---
Having more viewers doesn't necessitate more troops especially with a closed beta, many people just watch asmongold but dont even play WoW anymore (myself included). And then you got two Method raiders with their followers who you'd probably want on your side than less than attentive asmongold fans (lol), the two mages diving into them at the very last fight was already done several times just a huge lack of coordination especially when the main horde streamer was making the impact.
---
Carebears exist. Nothing wrong with that. Glad they have a home on pve servers where it's all safe and predictable. Everybody wins.
---
A virgin Asmon vs Chad Venruki
---
This is literally an overblown NA issue at best. Over in the EU we have like, literally no famous Classic streamer (no disrespect meant by this!). So chances of you playing in Europe and accidentally being on a 'streamer server' are very slim. Even if you do, said streamer probably wont have a massive army of followers and enemies running behind him...
---
That said, I would LOVE to play on NA servers and specifically on a streamer server. I'd also love the fact that 99% of the community in those servers should naturally speak English, which would make communication much easier.
---
I just think the time difference will be really bad. Like, if someone on the West coast starts to raid at, say 7 PM their time, it would be about 4-5 AM my local time. Trying to stay focused that late, be active on comms while everyone else is asleep and so on is pretty much not possible.
---
97,000 or something
---
He didn't actually want to play on a PvP server ever. I think he either joined this one because Esfand was on it or chat pressured him into it. Either way he didn't even want to pvp he just wanted to do the quest so I get the saltiness tbh.
---
Yep you need to turn the quality down - it was 1080p by default for me
---
I would REALLY enjoy that, my ping in games is fine but my download speed is abysmal. 
---
Oh well, I have a day off thursday anyway :)
---
This is basically what a streamer server will look like.
---
Except bfa is an expansion pack, not a standalone game, which also offers 1-110 experience. I hate modern wow as much as the next guy does but this comparisons are getting dumb.
---
Gratz to all ! Remember after blizzcon when this sub started! Cheers and spread the love for the game !
---
&lt;3 All!
---
BAFROOM...BAFROOM!
---
What’s wrong with your hair?
---
&gt; In Vanilla wow Hunters were probably one of the most played classes.   
---
&gt; Back in the day, almost no one had done research and you just installed the game, and picked a class. 
---
I feel like people who picked hunter also had no idea how much micro ammo and pet would be.
---
I think the idea of consent to film is essentially the same as a streamer ban, with softer terminology. It would be difficult to implement a server-wide ban, so if you leave it to the players to report offending streamers then the policing basically does itself.
---
Just a heads up, if you plan on mostly doing 5/10 man content, Paladins are the Best tanks for single tank content. There ability to aoe tank is second to none. Warrior tanks are pretty awful in 5/10 man dungeons but are Raid tank gods. A good prot paladin can cut a dungeon clear time by a huge chunk.
---
Pretty sure they already said that the stress tests wont be open to everyone, just that invites would be sent out to a much larger pool than currently.
---
Got in as well. EU access hype.
---
Fyi my account is from launch in Feb 2005
---
Resubbed last week a couple of days into beta
---
Rank 14 often needs collaborated effort and a person is picked by the community to get it.
---
This server decided asmongold should get a lvl 40 weapon. And he needes there help
---
Me and a friend had a conversation about how no game should ever last 15 years and perhaps why retail is so bad all because that journey was removed slowly over time.
---
With vanilla, a lot of the game was just leveling and experiencing the journey. Then the other half was end game, 5 mans, World PVP, Raiding. 
---
And where it should have ended, no BC or anything else. I know BC was great but at that point it should have been worked on twice as long and became WoW2(or whatever) with at least half of the game being about leveling and the journey/exploration/adventure that goes along with that. Then more end of course. 
---
Then do it again for WoW3 or whatever. Point is it's better to start over completely and experience that adventure again because it's so important. Instead of adding to it constantly while creating catch-up mechanics that completely invalidate that journey/adventure. Then continuously piling more and more systems on top that require having to add QoL changes to make it viable/navigable.
---
Addons were a thing back in vanilla you potato. You just were ignorant and didn't use them.
---
Just got in on EU beta as well! :-D
---
Played WoW for years at EU launch, but quit several expansions ago.
---
Resub'ed a couple days ago. Found my Beta access in bnet client just now!
---
Just looked through some of the addons...
---
What the hell is a "Dungeon score"??
---
 [https://willitclassic.com/view/fBiZ2n2XfMqpSVIRZ1m6](https://willitclassic.com/view/fBiZ2n2XfMqpSVIRZ1m6) 
---
I don't understand, can someone clarify?
---
I think the kind of person to answer a poll is the kind of person who looks at min/max spreadsheets and wants to pick a class thats good, but not super popular, blah blah blah. Its not reflective of whats actually going to happen on launch day. 
---
Point is, take the polls with a grain of salt.
---
Strippin has said he will roll on the RPPvP Server if there is one. Feelsbadman
---
I think the difference is that world pvp is more organic, warfronts was like a theme park attraction for kids, a watered down, neutered fake reinactment that you walk through while holding your kids hands and pointing and saying "look kids, that's what it was like", and there's some dude in a silly costume pretending to be a knight, while you pretend along with him for the sake of your kids.
---
I dunno that's how I saw Warfronts, it was so boring and felt meaningless, you were just trying to get it over with.
---
Blizzard were the first one to implement the concept of being able to play before the game was fully downloaded, Be sure that only few hundreds of MB are needed to create your character and start questing.
---
RIP my invite:(
---
Short answer: no
---
Long answer: maybe but there will be a dedicated player base that will play hardcore for at least a year- 2 years
---
Cut some sleep. Cheap, but not good for your health.
---
Brush up on your Chuck Norris jokes
---
no, its a video game
---
Hey its my addon, do you like it ?
---
the installer is only like 9 gigs, on a modern internet connection you'll be waiting about 10 minutes. not a big deal.
---
I got gifted a sub and that's the first time I've watched his stream lol
---
+1
---
There should definitely be at least one RP-PvP pr region.
---
It's a verbified form of the word Aspergers
---
FYI Trill won the Blizzcon arena tournament last year and is one of the top retail raiding guilds in the world. No real point to knowing any of this. Just thought it was interesting since I watched some of his stream.
---
My understanding is they send emails to notify you that you have been invited to the beta but they do not send beta keys. Once invited you will see classic on the Battle.net wow launcher after you have been invited and apparently sometimes before the email shows up.
---
No, expect it to be the same if not higher.
---
So many scrubs are gonna sub...
---
Feb 2006 boys, I started late ;o
---
I am 2006 player, not Invited. So I think they only invite 2005 now.
---
Yeah they totally were a thing! I’m just saying I think it’s lame - not claiming to be right or righteous
---
I'll be playing a horse protection warrior for Classic.  I have 14 days of holiday booked for the release, and I'm looking for a leveling pal who intends to be in the first batch of 60s raiding MC during those first lockouts.  Even better if you have a guild who is looking for an MT for those first few raids, since main tanking is what I want to do.  I'll be available to raid CET evenings.
---
It's the sort of thing that needs to be part of the base UI or prohibited entirely, no inbetween
---
Pull out the ethernet cables bois
---
Stay out of the cancer that is Trade chat and you will never run into any trouble with the reporting system.
---
Immmmm Innnnnnn. (EU) vanilla player since 11 feb 2005 (EU Launch) but Nevers played After MOB, just resub 6month last week
---
Murlocs come in packs and murlocs come with nets. Murlocs are quietly the most murderous thing in classic wow. They out here stacking bodies and we laugh at them like they are a joke.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
I appreciate the heads up, but I'm hoping to raid some too. I'm betting there will be a few guilds of older people with guilds that don't raid as  long and I'd rather be fury or prot than get stuck healing.
---
yeah good luck with that. probably should learn to accept its 2019
---
yes, but afaik that's private servers with buffed xp values on quests.
---
2004 no invite 😩
---
lol 9 gigs is an "install overnight and maybe it will be done in the morning" kind of install for me
---
fml
---
I opened up a ticket with Blizzard to confirm this and they stated that there would be an increase in invites going up the days of the stress test, but that would be the only day to get in. What i neglected to ask was whether those people get to stay in after the stress test is done.
---
Freaking seriously.
---
It doesn't even make RP sense most of the time. For example, I boosted to 110 with BFA because reasons, and instantly it started calling me such things. My character had literally done nothing yet. That character hadn't killed a single dungeon boss or completed a single quest.
---
Nope, there is no persistent world, its lobby based multiplayer, which is not MMO.
---
is he going to update pfQuest though ?
---
&gt;https://www.diffchecker.com/qZxY2wQT
---
Nice due diligence, good job man.
---
There should be big alliance and big horde streamer on a given server. Like shroud horde asmon alliance on one, soda vs I dunno ninja or lirik or whoever on another. 
---
3-4 servers split up like that with a bunch of mid and small streamers peppered throughout would be ideal, multiple perspectives on multiple servers, with room for servers without big streamer presence. 
---
Or something.
---
He could barely scrape together players over 25, and half of which weren't exactly listening or very aware of what was going on. Maybe after licking his wounds and getting his axe he can work on getting a group that listens as well as when he raids in retail.
---
Keep in mind you can only have one "tracking" either herbs or nodes active at one time.
---
congrats my dude
---
It seriously does open up metas and the possibility of PVP seasons.
---
Imagine them releasing separate PVP realms that open for 30 days where players compete to gear up and gain the most HK's or something.
---
"Gotta go grind stuff in retail, in order to grind stuff in classic, in order to go to BWL tonight" Owch
---
I don't get why some streams have webcams. Why are we watching some dudes face covering up part of the interface?
---
On the bright side, it's super easy to make friends in vanilla wow, just start talking while you're grouped. Once you have real friends you can ween yourself off streamers, lol
---
Staysafe won't play on a server with sodapoppin and asmongold
---
Just got in as well. Been playing since day 1, all collector's editions on my account. Not a streamer or personality just a random dude. Resubbed a couple of days ago with gold
---
It’s definitely awesome that people are finding things to do, but it’s a game people have been waiting for for over a decade to come back. It’s finally here, people are going to be hyped for a while.  
---
Now if they don’t increase the cap, I can imagine it won’t be like this in 5-6 weeks when beta is still out.
---
Oh well in that case 100% roll a warrior. There will definitely be more “casual” raiding guilds. Don’t worry about the end game enjoy the journey.
---
You severely underestimate the tenacity of powerlevelers and Korean gold farmers.  There's gonna be plenty of hunters.
---
Did not know that :(
---
So what should i do
---
Gun wise i think the engi gun looks way cooler imo. Flawless arcanite rifle. Sick AF
---
LUL 1996 called and wants their internet back 
---
I do have real friends, people who I've been friends with for over 10 years. I just can't ever start a conversation with anyone because I feel like I'll bother them. That's why streamers are good because I can just tune in and feel like I'm part of the conversation without the awkward part of initiating it. But I'm definitely looking forward to the social side of Classic! Have some good memories of meeting really cool people when I first started playing WoW in TBC.
---
Bloat is *an* issue, but I think mostly it's some scalability problems with how Blizz decided to make xpacs.
---
I mean it's not like it's 100% an inevitable problem for MMOs: Look at games like Runescape and OSRS, which have managed to stay popular despite all the content expansions.
---
The biggest issue is how blizz handled new zones in my opinion. They constantly tacked on 5+ new zones in a new continent, completely pushing max level play away from the rest of the world. Then, with the higher level cap, they had to squish the XP for the rest of the game so there wasn't a huge barrier to entry... This leads to worse content for leveling, and it makes the game feel dead since there's no max/high level people running around in low level areas... there's literally nothing for them there, and they never need to travel by foot through it.
---
A huge part of vanilla, and why it's such an engaging game, is that you really feel like you are in a world. You need to walk around to each new area, and travel back to areas you've been to 10+ levels ago. While leveling, you run into high level people out in the world, they aren't just sitting in cities or off in high level only zones. You just don't get that in any of the expansions since.
---
Personally, I think blizz should have done expansions by adding new continents that were not exclusively high level. They could have gone back and changed zones, for instance made duskwallow  a level 60+ zone, and then add in a new level 35-45 zone in outland. They also should have added more leveling dungeons, or changed content that wasn't just max level content. This would have kept the feeling that leveling is a part of the game, and not just a path to max where the game actually starts; and it would have kept that feeling of an interconnected world.
---
The other huge issue is QoL improvements and bad ideas like flying mounts, LFR/LFG, PvP stats, titanforging, garrisons, etc. that were just bad ideas in general and had really damaging problems with community aspects of the game. But IMO how continents and new zones were handled really put WoW on that path and showed how little understanding we had at the time about what made WoW a good game.
---
idk, I got through mythic Aggramar in Antorus with only pug groups, haven't played bfa though so maybe something has changed.
---
Hunters are powerhouses in pvp, especially prior to 60 when they can kite and harass anything within 10 levels to death.
---
At 60, their damage is still phenomenal. In 5 mans they are exceptionally useful bringing both utility, CC,  and dps.  This doesn't even touch upon their solo play of being able to both gank and farm.
---
Not everything has to do with pve raid dps numbers. Even then, bringing 2 extra hunters and the raid doing "optimally" 300 less dps is irrelevant for the super majority of guilds.
---
My account was opened in late 2004 and I did not get the beta. I have also gotten every beta since wrath. So I dunno that the age of your account matters in this regard.
---
Is it really only accounts who were created during vanilla? I used to share an account with my brother and created my own mid WoTLK. I did bring my vanilla druid over from the old account but the old account is not linked to battle.net iirc.
---
Idk, could just be a literal name reserve. But you're probably right
---
I’m interested in playing a Mage, I’m commenting here so I can refer back to the post this afternoon.
---
I’ve played Hunter (Vanilla), Warlock (Vanilla), Shaman (WotLK, Cata), Paladin (Tank, WotLK).
---
Raided through the beginning of Naxx in Vanilla, most of WotLK and some of Cata.
---
Just got in, my 2005 Account isnt subbed anymore since 2017. But my 2007 Account has an active sub. Im from Eu (germany)
---
Just mother? Try mother, sister, cousin, grandma, cat and dog.
---
So just play BFA?
---
E.g. Missdirection,tranq shot,will be needed.
---
In Terms of dps/dmg i might remember they were weaker than mages/locks in later raids.
---
But u will get more loot in raids since most raids are not overloaded with hunters i think.
---
I want to throw out an anecdotal story from my time playing vanilla.
---
My friends and I were able to 3 man SFK with the following party:
---
1. Hunter
---
2. Priest
---
3. Mage (underleveled by a couple levels)
---
Yes, we wiped multiple times. Yes it took a lot longer than it should have. But we still finished the entire dungeon with 3 people and no proper tank.
---
Maybe the lower level dungeons just aren't as hard as you remember?
---
It's literally not tho. Retail sprint seems more smooth, big steps. Classic sprint was basically same as walking but ridiculously fast.
---
It is slow but still superior to auto-attacking.
---
is dragon a world boss?
---
They might be the worst DPS on a meter but it's mandatory to bring 2-3 for Tranq shot rotations. Also, you're a fucking monster in PVP, solo and premade.
---
Hehe, you have to spec enh (2h talent) if u want to use staves in vanila.
---
He would only go Alliance for nightelves, for everything else he prefers Horde
---
I agree it was a terrible addition due to implementation. The fact that it takes you to the dungeon changes the way its played. If it would have put you in a queue where it grouped you with people on your server and you needed to walk to the dungeon it would be absolutely different. which is what these addons would potentially do. LFR on the other hand, yeah no bad, Id never in a million years use this as a way to get 40 people together. 
---
Now back to the original question whats the issue between discord and an app that would do essentially the same thing?
---
retail is hack n slash and free candy
---
So shocks reset the swing timer?? damn thats bad
---
has he done any healing? what i saw he was mostly playing enhance.
---
&gt; The most interesting info in the beta for me will be things like backfire rates on engi items relative to p servers, % chance proc on hand of edward the odd.
---
Apparently, the most interesting thing is the default raid frames being as good or better than Luna, and yet you still acted like an expert.
---
No cap at 60?
---
Ok?
---
If this is really vanilla like they should just buff dungeon and world elite mobs or this game will be a joke and people will quit faster than everyone is predicting. MC is already a joke on private servers and if MC in classic is anything like this video it will be worse. Blizzard would actually be saving classic if they buffed dungeon and world elites to match the experience.
---
It alsow requires that you share accounts and that's not allowed under ULA. On top of that the ability to detect account sharing has increased.
---
like i said idc about getting realm first, just trying to get maxed in the first wave (within 7 days of the realm first maxed)
---
Any decent QA system's going to prioritize and categorize the reports before anyone actually looks into it.
---
I'd rather have over reporting than under reporting any day.
---
Blizzard has said the patch notes don't reflect all the fixes since there's just too many minor things that get fixed that only a few notice.
---
Definitely want those Luna Unit Frames. Functionally, they were so good and crisp. Glad ElvUI is coming since I love the nameplates.
---
I just hope it is a rolling invite. Refreshing non-stop xD
---
I'm also curious if blizzard will continue adding vanilla wow accounts exclusively or start adding in newer accounts as well. I have a day 1 account with all of the expansions. I checked my total time played over all of my characters using the altoholic addon and I have 203 days 13 hours 58 minutes but still no invite.
---
Pretty sure that was a 2.0 change.
---
The main advantage racial I can think of is for PvP. 
---
Horde: WotF, Orc Stun resist coupled with warrior stun resist.
---
Ally: Human detect Stealth is VERY strong, I used it on my rogue back in vanilla and it let me win 90% of RvR matchups, Gnome clear root can be nice, and NE shadowmeld is actually insane for hunters / rogues / druids for restealth of trap placements.
---
In PvE i'd say weapon skills are a good start but you don't 100% need it.
---
I think people overestimate how far the streamer's fanbases will even manage to make it to mid/end game
---
I think it could be extended OSRS style; with new content that strictly adheres to a 'classic feel', so that you can essentially add to classic without really changing it to a different game
---
BLIZZARD JUST GIVE EVERYONE HERE AN INVITE
---
Oh well, it seems like it's an EU only wave, so 2004 bois never had a chance.
---
He's an aging man dating a 10/10 that plays WoW for a living. Haters gonna hate.
---
DM trib farming is one of the fastest g/hr grinds in the game, on top of the fact that it's instanced, so there's no competition.
---
Hunters are the only class that can solo DMN trib. We also know that they are the fastest levelers in the game, great at PvP, and have a low skill floor.
---
I'd expect it to be the #1 tourist class, and we'll see plenty of people who have never played classic wanting to pick them up. I think that in terms of PServer players coming back, relatively few will pick hunters as mains, but we'll see tons of hunter alts.
---
Right, thats what I always ask people on here. "Why dont just you play on a private server?" dont think I've ever gotten an answer, they just downvote you lol
---
you pretty much do not address any point in my last reply xD
---
Bartender!
---
I got an invite, my 2005 WoW account isnt subbed since 2017 i think.
---
Just got an 2007 Account with an active sub
---
They were used before bc dropped. Here’s pre patch. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1
---
The shared subscription guarantees classic carries live.
---
Since I get to decide for you, I'm gonna say just hard pass.
---
riding skill is 20g.  level 40 mount is 80g.  level 60 mount is 1000g.  this is before faction and PVP discounts.
---
riding skill is per faction. you need exalted to learn other race mounts. so if your gnome and want ne mount you'll need to be exalted with darnassus before you can buy the tiger riding and the mount.  you can (if you have the money) buy your mount for your race without having the exalted status.
---
Didn't get in, 07 date.
---
This is exactly how FFXIV handles it, and it works pretty well. Some of the cosmetic items are shop exclusives, but most of them are items from previous seasonal events. Since FFXIV doesn’t recycle events or their rewards, this gives people who missed it a chance to acquire the items.
---
of classic beta players?
---
6 PM PDT happens when this comment is 7 hours and 5 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/-wXvq-3WW
---
I love watching Mn's PvP videos - but after everything I've seen and heard, I would instantly transfer / re-roll if I knew APES was on my server.
---
NA PVP realm horde guild looking for players.
---
Core that we have now are all private server vets and looking for anyone and everyone who wants to raid! Raid times will be 8:30pm Eastern US Tuesday and Wednesday.
---
Msg me if you got any questions :)
---
Same. F.
---
No one complains about bfa mythic raids. 
---
When compared to classic, most people don’t complain about bfa combat rotations. (That said, I think the heyday for combat mechanics was Wrath-MoP)
---
I think the genuine complaint in combat mechanics is the modern reliance on cooldowns, burst windows, etc. it’s very different from classic PvP.
---
Bfa sucks because of every other mechanic and system. World quests, Azerite, titanforging, “seasons”, homogeny in class utility, itemization (except trinkets and the new CoS stuff is interesting), sharding, flying mounts, quest helper, heirlooms, etc. sucks. It all works to erode what it means—or meant—to play an mmo.
---
grats
---
"Streamers" says it all. Dramafaggots.
---
They are warleaders of the factions. Enough said
---
Misdirection is a BC skill.
---
add it to the bucket list
---
I would like Diablo esque hardcore realms. Where characters are deleted on death. Would be incredibly fun.
---
April 2005 as well, from Germany. No invite yet(Have to say, that I just subbed today, no bfa...)
---
Holy shit these are the types of people the servers are going to be filled with 😂
---
hm.. ye :/
---
Ah, this reminds me of when I was young and my parents wouldn't let me get a game console (not even an old used one with my own allowance money) so I resorted to drawing and cutting out sprites from various games and acting them out myself. :|
---
Just go Hogger
---
This will 100% not happen on release without streamer organizing it. 
---
What group of 40+ people will want to stop a random person from getting whirlwind axe
---
I don’t really understand your point. As far as I know current ticks in the game are &lt;50ms whereas it was around 300-400ms in vanilla. What I am trying to say is that the game’s network infrastructure is significantly different than it used to be. Trying to artifically make the game as if it has slower ticks, for the purpose of giving the “vanilla feel” of spell interactions, on a modern infrastructure can have unintended consequences. It most definitely isn’t as simple as changing a couple of lines in code to fix this “bug” as there is a hardware aspect of the things as well.
---
Can't get TF more funneld than every other MT in a progressive guild. It's down to the drop luck. The mount is a different case.
---
What answer do you think you will get on a subreddit full of fans of Classic WoW?
---
2004 EU boy, havent gotten an inv
---
when these drawings stop, we know it's cause you got an invite haha!
---
i admire the dedication. this itself should get u an invite
---
Good Thing i will play on EU Servers
---
The amount of free gold I've gotten from other people's kills is pretty noteworthy. I think of places like Southern Barrens which is less populated and most of the quests require you to kill beasts. Certainly not everyone picks up skinning so I feel like I can flip a coin everytime I run around down there regarding whether there will be dead thunder lizards and zhevras just laying around. At that point it's no effort besides stopping to skin - and it's medium leather at the level. So in the span of like 1 minute you can make a good chunk of coin for just right clicking.
---
I'm at work so I can't check my bnet client but I haven't got an email so I'm just gonna assume I haven't got in.
---
Also a potential idea.
---
I think if this game goes down the development route of OSRS this could be a healthy route for the game to take.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a large guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!

Nobody was able to do this in vanilla but in beta everybody can do it.
---
Everybody even in trash gear can tank dungeons like its nothing yeah right.
---
He also needs a few more trustworthy people to coordinate
---
Oh I did. Just figured I'd mention it here too!
---
Yeah but the company isn’t telling you you can’t. And that its bad. You can play with first edition rules any time you want.
---
If the 0-5 yard DOES include the combat reach, shouldnt the 8-35 ALSO include combat reach already? rather than adding it on top? Like why would the melee one have it included in the tooltip range, but the ranged attack have it additional to the range tooltip?
---
These drawings are actually really impressive.
---
how's that relevant here? just people buying these to sub up and pay for classic at a discount
---
waves are 100% random all you need is sub :^)
---
Once you hit exalted with the race faction you can use their mount.
---
You can also get a skeletal war horse from stratholme's baron rivendare.
---
so would I...but Im still going to make fun of you...ya know banter and all..
---
There are almost no addons so rolling with the defaults.  Performance is good.  120 fps with max settings no AA.
---
Moo used to stream for &gt;500 people, now had consistent 1.5k-2k and he hadn’t changed his persona. The only questionable him about him rn is that he hangs with Esfand and the like. Which won’t happen on live cause he’s EU.
---
How would it cause confusion?
---
Boy, its hard to remember. I would say yeah, between 20 and 25 hours of BGs a week. I'm trying to remember my weekend habits but it's a scary thought.
---
u know its still the same world as today right
---
When was your account created?
---
I randomly ended up on a pvp server back in 2005.  our guild was full of mature players.   most were between 20 and 30 years of age and we competed for all the server first kills.
---
His last point is where I'm at... discovery and adventur. If I've already been there 10 times, yes it'll be fun, but nothing like my first time experiencing it and uncertain of what is next to discover.
---
OMG!!! All this time seeing this image and I've missed that. ;(
---
Impossible to implement, pointless to even request.  Just ignore them and it won’t even impact you. 
---
You’re like the guy that gets all bent out of shape and angry when a coworker gets a raise or promotion instead of just focusing on your own shit. 
---
Nobody likes that guy.
---
Your raid schedules are awesome &lt;3
---
What kind of servers are you interested in?
---
Potential streamer/crowded servers, or non-streamer/low-med pop servers?
---
Yeah, it's not that so much content exists, but that anything that's not the current expansion is effectively dead content.
---
I was curious to see how he would react to older content when he actually sat down and played it.
---
Did you see their SFK run? So heartwarming seeing Mike hating how much he's loving it.
---
They build a wall with all those bodies to funnel us in.
---
I mean, I sucks if you enjoy watching a streamer play wow and just feel you have to stop for a few months because it will take away from your experience. 
---
I watch a little Swifty the other night and I think it could take away from reliving the whole thing again. At the end of the day if you don't watch a lot it probably won't "ruin" too much.
---
He doesn't have a single video like that. He mostly makes videos about how Blizzard handles the game and puts out his opinions about it, in a way many people enjoy. His last video came out 7 months ago and the reddit post about it on /r/wow has 17k+ upvotes and 4k comments.
---
Holy Paladin because support buffs and heals. Also gives you both an easier time to get into dungeons because you already got a healer.
---
I love reading this every time it’s posted, because it shows that really when the desire is there and the people make their voice heard, good things can actually be accomplished. I also like to imagine the “akshually” type guy smugly chuckling to himself while he types it out, happy that he gets to be the one that shuts down some hope people have.
---
Glorious auto-wanding beats out auto-attacking every day since you don't have to sit through:
---
*Parry*
---
*Miss*
---
*Block*
---
Every time you want to kill a mob 1 level higher than you. Instead it's just the occasional resist.
---
This weekend I'd of rushed home to check. After a weekend of disappointment, I will finish my beer then go home and check.
---
Exactly.  The classic experience isnt just end game. Its every. fucking. level.   
---
Ive always enjoyed min/maxing at all levels, even so much as to go out of my way for a day or so just to get 1 OP piece of gear for my level. That's what excites me.  Being a lvl 25 rogue in RFK and out dpsing the lvl 30s.    
---
Shit like that gets me hyped.
---
An pally would be pretty great for nearly 0 downtime between flash heal being cheap on mana, ability to get a group started (with pally healer), different gear entirely to roll on from pally, and pally with Righteous Fury can kinda tank some harder hitting mobs with just some seal and healing work if you're too squishy.
---
No but small streamers aren't the problem. It's the medium to large streamers who will want to have their own server.
---
They are building a wall with all those bodies to funnel us in.
---
Most people won’t clear Naxx, so the solution is post Naxx content? Wtf? People who want BC probably won’t xlear Naxx, just like most people who want TBC won’t clear Sunwell. That’s not a good metric for releasing content. 
---
Also, I don’t want modern designed raids in Vanilla. They would stick out like a sore thumb, and I don’t think the current designers can ft the themes, mechanics, and style of old content. Imagine having something like Tomb of Sargeras replace Naxx. That would really be a travesty.
---
Be social, pull mobs one at a time, be ready to use most of your abilities and lots of food/potions.
---
np, I did watch the short video this asmondude made and I really enjoyed it.  As long as they put in effort to add extra value to raw twitch footage, I think they are doing a good job.
---
I have really enjoyed watching Crendor again. He's a really down to earth guy.
---
having seen that live, I honestly expected the video to be about this clip. just amazing what he did :)
---
Morning hair hehe you little butthole you
---
Swords...not so much. However maces will work due to the stun they give off with 5 points in mace spec.
---
Wow...yeah, jesus, you can see how insane the melee range is there too.  So okay, it definitely DOES scale with size, which implies the formula applies.
---
*Now* I see what you're saying.  It may say 8-35y in the tooltip, but that's always on top of combat reach variables while melee range is always 5 OR factors in combat reaches + 4/3.  In fact, melee abilities do technically say "Melee Range" in the tooltip in-game, not 5, don't they?  They say 5y in databases but only because of the coding.
---
Holy shit this is the best thing ever.
---
I think this is what made so many people be okay with playing like 2-4 cycles of Vanilla on private server from start to finish. In retail, if I had to start over I'd be annoyed that I have to get back to max and get my gear again. In Vanilla I'm always happy to just level for a few hours and see what weird variety of experiences lie in wait.
---
I recovered mine using just the following information:
---
Name of two of the characters on the account, and their servers.
---
Full name and address used during account creation.
---
Account name, but I wasn't sure if I remembered it correctly. When the account was recovered, it had the name I thought but I have no idea if that's because I remembered right or because the GM gave it the name I said when converting it into a battle.net account. It was from before that was a thing and hadn't been logged in since 2006.
---
I think as long as you can supply like two pieces of verifiable information (e.g. char names + account holder's name) that's probably fine. I didn't send any CD keys or credit card information or anything.
---
Play something that can stealth.  Stealth duos are so much fun!  (both pvp and pve)
---
Hemo is very gear dependent in general, so it likely won't be all that viable until later in the phases.  
---
I tried to during vanilla in a mix of dungeon blues, quest greens and a Krol Blade. Brann Stark could kick harder than I could hit for.
---
Hey man, you EU as well or NA? ALSO how old is your account, 2004, 2005, 2006+?
---
*wow, that’s totally what a clown would say, stop circlejerking*
---
Druid is a good choice for this imo
---
everyone who says its just nostalgia is stupid and should open their mind for it
---
You might be somewhat correct but releasing a brand new MMO every 2 years wouldn't go well. There needs to be some kind of middle ground that I'm not sure what the solution would be.
---
yawn. dude its classic wow. You could have a raid of all hunter dps and everything before Naxx would still die easily.
---
He also asked about MC/Ony--which is when you vanilla neckbeards say hunters are most competitive. 
---
Hunters will have plenty of raid spots and will be plenty desired. They may do less damage than a mage, but their pve raid rotation is infinitely more interesting to play. Id much rather give gear and a raid spot to a hunter having a great time who I know will keep showing up over the mage who is bored out of his mind and liable to quit when the next Battle Royale Unexpectedly drops.
---
What a very reasonable and good stance to take
---
Play the game and learn as you go. We didn’t need tips when it first launched. Explore. Talk to people. Join groups. That’s it.
---
Nice! EU or NA?
---
All of those are strong in Classic. Lol. With two people, regardless, you'll have a pretty big advantage against anyone you run into.
---
&gt; Spaz means like, a weirdo
---
It's slang for [spastic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spastic).  Was used *a lot* when I was in secondary school (UK) about 15 years ago ago; seems to have made a comeback online since.
---
yeah but its not drastically different like you dont feel like you're in a different game or anything
---
Its viable with bwl and aq pieces, before that i wouldnt really bother and stick with nightfall.
---
Could someone please confirm if there's an email notification?
---
EU or NA?
---
Mine in end of vanilla
---
https://i.imgur.com/K36zUm2.jpg
---
EU as well, day 1 account.
---
What progression guilds currently have RFD on farm, and are recruiting lvl 30 Warlock with pre dungeon BIS?
---
Same here, started on EU launch, left at end of BC and resubbed last week.
---
there was no melee hunter in vanilla?
---
they added that like an expansion back
---
as i said stuff like the feral cat would be a spare tank while he is not tanking 
---
so you feed him mostly bear stuff and he plays feral
---
some day a tank is a no show you have the flexibility for him to tank they can raid tank fine
---
same with boomkin he is like a spare healer you can just hot swap in if you ever need, you feed him mostly healing stuff and anything the casters dont want that will get de'ed etc.
---
if they were a good player and a team player id consider it not like multiple for sure but even if you carry a couple players to have a spare geared healer and tank id be fine if it kept them happy.
---
you need 40 people to turn up every raid id be fine with picking a couple super solod players playing garbage builds if they were positive and flexible to fill other roles.if ever needed
---
That's a great idea!  Like a different old school game, right?
---
I have 2 BFA accounts, back in legion I did not get 2 beta accounts, and I never get 2 PTR accounts. I'm sure I won't get 2 classic BETA accounts, but classic live (which you are mainly inquiring about) is still unforeseen and no one is quite sure yet.
---
In other words: GOOD QUESTION!
---
One man's low level alt is another man's main :( 
---
#neverhit60
---
Druid because they heal, they tank and, you both have stealth.
---
I'm 21, started playing in late tbc. To be honest nostalgia is a big part of the appeal of classic for me, since at 7 years old I wasn't even getting to outland, let alone raiding, so a lot of my experience was slightly more QoL'd vanilla. That said, I've thought since cata that the game was going the wrong way, and I'm really hyped for classic to be a chance to test that!
---
Basically anything except another rogue, warrior, or mage is fine.
---
Those three are markedly worse because they don't have heals or a pet to tank for you. Having one or both of those things decreases downtime massively, and is huge for making xp/hr competitive as duo levelers.
---
Yes, I did. Why give streamers priority? Advertising.
---
They should have numerous methods to let people in who want to test this? It's ALWAYS been a select few getting in. I want in just as bad as you, but that doesn't mean I deserve to have an invite sitting in my inbox. 
---
It's week 2 of a 3 month wait. They aren't letting the entire subreddit in just because you "want" to be there.
---
Sounds like a great topic to discuss with a therapist.
---
That's a slippery slope argument. You're assuming that raiding is the single absolute source of gear, when it is not.
---
In Classic, other than raiding you had crafted and dungeon items. Some reputation items as well.
---
In Retail, you have M+ (same as dungeon) and crafted items. Yes, that's right, for many specs an Alchemy trinket can go even with many top-end trinkets, with the bonus of giving even more sustainability through the potion effect bonus. Ever since 8.0 you could craft gear with ilevel as high as Mythic, and in 8.2 the bind-on-pickup gear obtained through professions will be ilevel 440+slot, being even more powerful than Mythic raid gear because of the socket slot. 
---
When you have thousands of ways to get gear, from the game's very inception itself, the cultivated raiding mentality should look for **progress** as the biggest form of reward and sense of character progression, not exclusively *raid gear*.
---
So, to answer your question, why have gear then? You can very well itemize your character through a multitude of sources, and you always could. Of course, the very best in slot items you can only obtain through the hardest difficulty of raiding, but the real reward should be seen as progress, boss kills. That's a solid way to measure character growth and progress.
---
Account created christmas 2005, resubbed earlier this week. No invite yet. Yes I do own BFA, bought that last fall but quit playing in a month cause I found it boring.
---
There were goon squads in a lot of places. Sporeggar-EU hd them as well.
---
Useless assholes.
---
No, it looks like shit.
---
How about you sift through the hours of shitty content on his YT to find a whole bunch of other misinformation. Not to mention the incredibly cringeworthy "interviews" with Ohgee and Monkeynews...
---
Gear score does NOT matter in classic. The game is about itemization. The reason that a level 30 weapon is Bic for ferals, or a lvl 57 brs trinket is still widely used into naxx, gear score has NO place in classic/vanilla.
---
To each their own.  I left in Vanilla but Cataclysm ruined the game IMO LOL.
---
Im wiping out the ui for sure. ElvUI and Vuhdo most likely along with threat and dps meters. I just dont like the default ui and I can set those two up very quickly. Other things like auction house, mail, etc. are likely. Weakaura's if they port it over. I'll probably try and stay away from quest helpers at first but we'll see.  If I start raiding for real then I'll start using timers. All of this is 100% personal preference. There is no "right" way to do it unless you are continually wiping your group (and only then if they care).
---
Oh didn't know that thank you!
---
Wait, wasn't that a joke? Is that real??
---
&gt; yes, but afaik that's private servers with buffed xp values on quests.
---
Quest XP has been fixed since Mar 2018 - Joana did 94 hours on a current, accurate server. Many have done sub 100s. I've got a 114 hour paladin on an accurate server.
---
I GOT IT I AM CRYING.
---
2005 EU release account. GF also got it!! She is on a 2010ish Cataclysm account.
---
Both EU. So you all really do have a chance! Both newer accounts and all of you EU pals.
---
pat, goes by milksteaklol
---
he has been playing vanilla shaman since 2004....including pservers. he is very good.
---
wtf why
---
Meanwhile Asmongold was strafe jumping left and right hitting no one
---
You realize you are suggesting people quit their jobs so they can have more fun playing a video game... 
---
Most streamers can’t afford to not stream the games they are known for, doubly so when a new title comes out in their genre.
---
this..  you both  an stealth past mobs or gank in PVP (or avoid gankers).  for groups you can either tank or heal on druid (with gear).  or tank an elite mob while they kill it from bear form.  pop out and heal them. etc.
---
But nobody here is talking about BC. You just came outta nowhere shit-talking people who started in BC out of nowhere.
---
I just got it, same with my gf. I have EU release date account and she has cataclysm account. So they are inviting randomly.

I would absolutely love if they capped us at 30 for a month upon release. Then cap us at 50 for a month. Then let us hit 60. Would be so much better for release. Let everyone stop and smell the roses without the pressure of feeling like they need to blitzkrieg to 60 or take time off work.
---
Thank you robot
---
The points he’s making are valid. But the funny French frog voice is hilarious. He has to be doing it on purpose.
---
No I missed it!
---
He was never a Classic hater really, but he was  very much in the "it's not for me" camp, I super love see how much fun he's having.
---
Yeah, pretty is doesn't have to be every 2 years, besides that short of a time frame would result in a terrible incomplete game like.... everything today.
---
I'm not concern so much about the frequency as I am the constant continuation of the end-game stuff. Just throw in the towel at some point before we get stuff like BFA. It'd be better that way.
---
Wow launch account, full content clear of Vanilla and no invite. 
---
Better invite all the meme streamers who never even stepped foot in naxx though!
---
Hi there. I mained hunter throughout vanilla and TBC, and my primary alt was warlock for that time.
---
Both Hunter and Warlock are going to level faster than most classes, with the slight edge going to Hunter. Feign death gets you out of so many bad situations that would end in death if you were playing warlock, and the classic WoW corpse runs were super time-consuming. If you have a leveling partner who is playing a healer, you can probably go just as fast on a warlock as on a hunter. 
---
As far as max-level play goes, you can solo things on a hunter that you won't be able to on a warlock by kiting. This is a skill that you'll need to work on and perfect in order to complete your epic bow/staff quest. Warlocks can kite to some extent, but they have no mobility options, so if the enemy is immune to fear before it dies you'll be in trouble (not to mention feared mobs run faster in vanilla and tend to pull adds.)
---
In terms of high-level groups and raiding, your DPS rotation on a hunter is more complicated and nuanced than that of a warlock, so you will need to focus more on that in order to be competitive. That being said, once you figure it out, your damage is very consistent. Warlock requires less attention to maximize your DPS, but your damage is volatile until lategame due to the way that spell hit works. Sometimes you'll get back to back to back crits and top damage meters. Other times you'll miss four times in a row and get out-DPS'd by the ret pally.
---
Aside from those differences, I'd encourage you to think about which class resonates with you, regarding lore and utility. Hunters are your typical fantasy trope of a bow-wielding ranger, whereas warlocks are power-hungry mages that make dark pacts with demons. Hunters tend to be the point-person in big groups because you can make long pulls, kite, then feign death for the tank to pick up the mob. Warlocks are usually going to sit at the back and blow things up.

---
Well, obviously you're going to choose which server you want the name to be on.
---
If ingame or on a website. It wouldn't make any sense otherwise.
---
the only way the world gets smaller 'effectively' is when new travel options are introduced that shorten the time between two points
---
so cataclysm was what made azeroth smaller.
---
Yeah it really left its roots there
---
Yeah lol! 
---
My fave retro stream is "Two Girls 1 CPU" on the Yogscast Channel, if you are looking
---
I’ve nvr watched streamers, I just don’t get it, maybe I’m just old🤷‍♂️.  The only game related stuff I watch on YouTube is FatbossTV since I don’t like doing new dungeons/raids totally clueless.  Only 99 more days but who’s counting😁.
---
Watch a few Chuck Norris tv shows and movies.  This will be important if you level in the Barrens.
---
Thanks man, I'll check it out :)
---
You spend over $3k on coffee a year?
---
Druid/Sub rogue is such a fun duo.  
---
Open in cat, he can ambush, then you switch to bear and tank and he can backstab.  
---
You'll be unstoppable in world pvp too.
---
Yeah I know man.  I even like him and I do believe he is amazing, easily one of the best mages ever.  But if you claim that maybe the title may be exaggerating a play or the ‘insane burst’ then you’ll just be downvoted to hell i guess.
---
This was INCREDIBLY good holy shit
---
Why wouldn't it?
---
BOOM! The guys next to the hunter are going to be deaf by the end of the fight :j
---
It works based on "outside/inside" iirc
---
‘Eyy, Grats ‘Mon
---
People here are so fucking green it hurts. Ppl being impressed by a mage running into the enemy crowd and missing 90% of players with his CoC. Pls go back to BFA
---
just don't be annoying and learn to be social.
---
Shroud is playing shaman
---
Plus having a dedicated tank like this would actually make Daggers/Backstab a bit more *bear*able while leveling.
---
I'd probably still go the usual Combat Swords build, but still, it'd at least be an option!
---
Its a beta. Nobody cares. It’s for testing. It’s not for you to cry about shit.
---
Just like a Diablo game
---
No, leave that shit for retail
---
I don't think it will be too much of a deal. The biggest streamers will take up a few servers, that's easily avoidable. Smaller streamers aren't really an issue. If anything it's more people to kill in pvp, as you can tell from most of these clips the people who follow these streamers aren't the best at the game. Vanilla WoW is a game of opportunity, be clever, you can absolutely ruin a streamers day if you want to.
---
I am rolling hunter. Anecdotal, but there it is. ;)
---
Blizzard should add a new /sip emote to Classic.
---
Yeah idk about that. That last post 45min ago had everyone saying they got in all be EU, and all were original about day 1 EU accounts
---
you can still rip aggro but it is much harder to do. Threat is still a thing, just not as big of one.
---
It's unwise to not level Enchanting along the way. You can respec to Engineering without incident, but you'll be clawing your eyes out collecting low level mats for a level 60 Enchant grind.
---
She should complement your collection professions, imo, which means Mining. My brother and I will both be taking Mining and then he Skinning and I Herbalism, and we'll stock up our Mining mats for Engineering grinds at 60. I'd recommend a similar strat for you two.
---
Yes, that's what he meant
---
mrglglglgl!!
---
Blizz doesnt need to enforce anything. Classic already naturally has this.
---
I guess depends on what you consider "big" but: venruki, Sonidigital, Savix and plenty others are also really good.
---
Yeah boyy
---
and no beta.
---
&lt;sigh&gt;
---
Choose 4:
---
Skinning -&gt; Leatherworking
---
Herbalism -&gt; Alchemy

Mining - &gt; Engineering

Maybe LW and Mining, in order to save up mats for your disenchanting and engineeing later, also for a the peices of gear you will both want being leather classes?
---
Good point, I did not think of that.
---
It is certain that melee abilities are handled at least a bit differently, since the melee formula
---
&gt;Melee attack: MAX(5, SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + 4/3) + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(8/3)
---
does not take any raw attack range as a parameter. I suspect that autoattack and abilities using the melee formula simply display 5yds (note that this also depends on patch, on most patches they just say *melee range*), as it is the minimum effective range; otherwise they should show 4/3=1.33yds, which is kind of the raw attack range in this formula.
---
This does get somewhat farfetched, though, so I guess it's equally possible that something is bugged and the minimum autoshoot range should be smaller.
---
Invest in bags and profs
---
Quin got a kill?
---
im usto seeing him run into traps and die in poe
---
Kind of. It's issues in terms of population, community, p2w etc I've tried a few different ones and after the nostalgia wears off it's not something I'd play for an extended period of time.
---
You might but, something tells me you would "feel the call". By that I mean theres a war out there son. You gonna sit on your laurels while your entire faction is denied flurry axe?
---
It’s not even that it wasn’t a cool little play I mean he ran into a lot of dudes and lived while getting off *some* damage.  
---
But, “INSANE BURST AND CONTROL”.... come the fuck on dude lol he just novas a couple people it’s standard vanilla gameplay
---
What are you talking about?
---
&gt; How do we know that was done on purpose though? It could be a bug, hence the feature.
---
I know it was done on purpose in Classic because it's been that way since Vanilla. Actually, there's not even a point in debating whether it was done on purpose, because I doubt a single developer has touched the code that decides the stats on those boots since they were created almost 2 decades ago. Do you think devs went through and manually recreated every piece of gear in the game and assigned what they believe to be the correct stats? They have no armor in Classic because their ancient code gave them none in Vanilla.
---
&gt; No one said it does, but if other default gear items have it, then why not?
---
They likely don't have any due to how low the other stats are. The armor of pants is generally more than double the armor of boots, and what's less than half of 2? 0.
---
&gt; That may be the case with Classic, but they've always at the very least had armour.
---
No, they literally didn't. The boots you spawn with in starting zones in Vanilla have never given armor, they've always been cosmetic.
---
Also it is not rolling invite. It seems all got flagged on same time. So RIP for everyone who is not in :)
---
Boomkin doesnt work at all for raiding. Same with ele shaman. Wasnt until TBC that ele shammys had a place at the table and the lack of an aggro drop hurt them then. No mana sustain whatsoever combined with completely nature immune or highly resistant nature damage mobs makes both specs completely unviable for raiding. Might as well add in healers are usually a commodity and not something most guilds will have extra of. 
---
With all that said, if no caster dps needs the item by all means give it to a shaman or druid. From my understanding, a shaman can actually run a PvP ele/resto build when raiding so you'll definitely make them VERY happy. I cant recall if that one fun as hell balance/resto/feral druud PvP build could work raiding. If so, they would love caster gear too
---
 I dont really care either way what you do with your time, you shouldnt care what people do with their time.. just petty bs tbh
---
I was more so commenting on the needing a raid part.
---
Excellent.  I very much enjoy doing the same, for pve and pvp. Nothing like having a twink just to plow through WC to help guidlies get good gear.
---
Checked account history, goes back to 2/01/2006 for WoW but not a streamer. Not invited...
---
I just got it as well, EU
---
TIPS OUT BABY XD
---
I just got it, eu
---
&gt; I think it's mostly because asmongold just wanted to do his axe quest, not so much go full Horde Vs Alliance for that long
---
That's what PvE servers are for
---
Raiding is fun. The gear treadmill is not. I wish they could constantly create dungeons and raids that are REALLY hard and are not just "nerf" over-time by getting better and better gear. They stay hard and they drop cosmetic gear and mounts and shit. There comes a time when you just aren't excited by loot anymore ... at least for me. The whole point of the gear treadmill is to force players to run content over and over (so they have to develop less of it -- because it takes a lot of time and resources to develop content).
---
If there was some way to crank out raids and dungeons at a higher rate, without increasing ilvl each time... man, that's the game for me! :D
---
Go back to retail
---
He has tons of "Asmongold reacts videos". Wtf are you talking about?
---
Many people here saying they're from EU unlike the previous threads.
---
Hey /u/Pixelswtf what's your ping to the server?
---
 \*\*Not the Face\*\*
---
&lt;[https://www.nottheface.com](https://www.nottheface.com/)\&gt;
---
Loot Council / DKP Combo
---
Recruiting: A Couple Officer Positions / All Classes / Absorbing Small Guilds
---
\*\*Intro:\*\*
---
Not the Face was initially created in 2007 as a semi-troll / PVP guild on Destromath-US. A server wide forum post was made claiming that NTF, as well as many other PVP Guilds, were incapable of progressing in high end raiding. As the servers top PVE Guilds were just closing in on Illidan NTF combined with many other pvp guilds and tore through ALL of the TBC content in a matter of weeks. NTF is now reforming for Classic WoW in 2019. A Horde Guild with an overall goal of PVE and PVP destruction; NTF plans to accomplish everything that Classic has to offer. Our goals include everything from acquiring all legendary weapons to running 24/7 High Warlord grind teams. Scarab Lord titles to camping STV to farm angry posts on the server forums. We plan to accomplish our goals by providing structure and guidance for what would regularly be a rag-tag group of washed up has been wannabes.
---
\*\*Expectations:\*\*
---
We require a 90% participation for raids, though we are flexible with RL schedules if something comes up. 18+ / We swear, drink, laugh and have a good time. Not a good place for children. Please have a plan for leveling. Requesting days off is not required. But is recommended.
---
\*\*Schedule:\*\*
---
We raid PST evenings generally starting at 5pm. Raids will be 3 times a week. Monday, Wednesday and Friday. These times are subject to change during progression.
---
When honor is released we will be running a 24/7 premade for HWL farming. We have a few no lifers whom want to accomplish this goal for some reason. Though this is not required by any means.
---
If you have any questions feel free to talk to us on our forums, in-game or on discord (oheyspun#1337)
---
I think it was an EU only wave
---
It's almost the same right? With some more tags and descriptions?
---
This makes me sad :(
---
I don't think there's an age restriction.  Someone said "boomer" is a state of mind and I think I agree. Have fun and enjoy Classic. I'll toss you a Fortitude buff if I happen to pass you on the road.
---
EU? What's your ping to the server?
---
&gt; He didn't actually want to play on a PvP server ever.
---
Yeah, but he did
---
Go take any of those shitters and let them play against anyone from &lt;APES&gt;, &lt;EVERYONE IS SO BAD&gt;, &lt;The Naga U Love to Hate&gt;, or &lt;Korean btw&gt;, it‘s not gonna be even close. You retail scrubs have no clue what you are up to.

---
How's your ping to the server?
---
I did not receive an email, but you get another PTR account on your battle net page. So check there once in a while.
---
Just to confirm, when beta came out you were not subbed, and you subbed after and got in?
---
Good answer!
---
I have an account from June 06' too!
---
Yea horde is better for the pvp and he could play with friends but he would be OK with just his friends also going alliance. I don't know would just be interesting to see. Currently it's looking like 3 or 4 of the bigger alliance streamers will be possibly going pve and then all the horde ones would be going pvp which there's way more horde streamers, and I'd like to see streamer battles again but idk the chance of it happening on launch anymore.
---
I made a mage in classic just to do ridiculous things with Cold Snap, multiple COC's and Ice Blocks. At the risk of /r/thathappened I remember an Arathi Basin where I held Mines alone against 4 people and killed all 4 of them.
---
I’m in the same boat as AirSalah, dad here. Classic noob,  though I did play TBC up tell Wrath. I’ll be rolling a troll Hunter. But! If there’s a guild out there for us and they need a Tank or Healer I think I can make that work. PM me as well.
---
Motivate me to care about this post.
---
Dont play it
---
I mean that's how we eventually got to where we are. These sort of addons were used even back in TBC (AV premades anyone?). People will use em, and it spreads. Its how it happened back in the early days in WoW and its how it'll happen again unless its stopped.

---
Maybe he changed his mind then. During the live stream he said, "yah, so this is why I didn't want tonplay on a pvp server."
---
Nope. Motivation is your responsibility and technically any kind of Marketing's responsibility to hype things up. That or wait until it comes out, spend $15, like or hate it within a month, carry on or don't.
---
Absolutely, I'm too old to be arsed with world PvP so I will play peacefully on a PvE realm on an EU server. This comes with the added bonus of not having an army of acolytes doing some dumb streamer's bidding.
---
You really are trying your best to bury this aren't you?
---
I wouldn't be opposed to certain personalities being "assigned" servers at launch. Obviously if someone rises to stardom post-launch there's little that can be done. But it could be fun to pair streamers together (and against) each other ... a little social engineering ;)

Asmon wouldn't contribute to good PvP even if he rolled on a PvP server anyways. The guy's bad at the game.
---
Don't worry, I'm pretty sure there will be some good ally players to give Soda a run for his money.
---
I'm current watching Frostadamus's stream and he is in the Thistlefur cave in Ashenvale. When he casts arcane explosion, the totems summoned by the mobs are dying. This should not be happening.
---
I found [this video of ZF from 2006.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNXxpiJ2_M) At about 12 seconds in, the mage in the group runs into melee range to cast 2 arcane explosions. The first one is before Antu'sul summons his totem. The second is after the totem has spawned in, but it does not kill the totem. The rogue must switch targets and auto-attack the totem to kill it. 
---
I believe NPC totems are susceptible to AoE in Modern WoW and that this is just an oversight. Does anyone have any memories or proof of this one way or the other?

---
I'm the opposite. 
---
I see the classic beta as a head start on figuring out exactly which class I want to main and it gives you a chance to find a good leveling route so when  it actually releases you will know where to go and which quests to do. Being part of beta is like getting to own classic wow 3 months before everyone else. I'm very jealous and every game I play right now seems pointless. I need classic wow right now.
---
&gt; and in terms of damage, they might not have the highest DPS, but they will sure as shit be high up on the "damage done" meter due to their great threat reduction.
---
People talk down on hunter's DPS while ignoring that hunters are always the top 3 spots for the first 5 seconds of a fight :)
---
If you don't have motivation to play it then don't play it, it's not our job to convince you to play a game you're clearly not interested in
---
Lmao they will deepdick the autists, boomers and incels. Trust me, those pservers shitmunchers will be crying back on their pirate servers by Christmas. A glad from BC to BfA owns shitters who left the game when they couldn't crush people with gear alone.
---
This phrase goes well with the game Rust.
---
Possible if most of your viewers are in your guild. Just send out the G messages to mobilize and as it starts turn on your stream with a vikings helm on and yell "TO BATTLE!!!!" as everyone mounts and storms the gates of Orgrimmar.
---
I believe it will say ‘Beta:’ before it
---
It's a beta.
---
Does it wipe on official release?
---
I think German map game player Tommykay is going to play classic, idk if he will play on German servers though he has a pretty international audience.
---
Did either of you have active subscriptions?
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/VertualExchange/search?query=reacts which ones?
---
I never understood why blizz wouldnt just implement a feedback option in game so they could reach every active player and get their opinion on a popular issue. Instead, they just took the mouth-breathing twitter and forum troglodytes at their word and made decisions based on what was likely just 1/100th of the player base.  
---
A simple multiple choice or poll wouldnt have been hard.  
---
No... instead they gave us Bejeweled.
---
jfc
---
Yup! Can still watch it on Twitch, just skip past the Deadmines part. I think it's around the part where they're in the spiral staircases either before or after Fenris but not sure.
---
Yeah it was never that he disliked Vanilla at all. All his Vanilla retrospective videos make it clear how much that period meant to him.  It seemed to be the whole "been there done that" aspect along with being used to some of modern WoW's conveniences. But between the facts that he's having more fun than he wants to be having, and that Classic content on Twitch/Youtube is seemingly going to be more popular than BfA for a good while, it's probably only his commitments to his guild and to his core audience that might be stopping him from playing classic even more heavily.
---
I mean I can see why they'd invite the streamers. They've raised a ton of interest and hype in the game by making it easy to view. It's good marketing.
---
Grats! On the offchance, do you happen to have (or had) a Tauren Warrior called "Flashh" on one of your EU accounts?
---
jist rested level to 60 with a friend 
---
you can just casually log in and play for a couple hours whenever and level together
---
i leveled with a chick in vanilla and we had a blast , i jist played th3 char when she wanted to play
---
i only really care about raiding but it was a lot of fun.
---
im pretty sure i was a warrior and im guessing she was a nightelf  druid or something
---
90% of these major streamers hated Vanilla and hated on anyone who suggested Classic. Now they are all acting like they wanted it from the beginning. 
---
The small streamers are no issue to me. It's the big ones that take free handouts or command their followers to do things for them. I'd be willing to bet all of these big streamers have their followers do a majority of the farming for the aq scepter.
---
No pls don’t take my account Hackerman

Yikes lmao. Hmu @ launch and I’ll help you 😂

Does anyone know if the beta access shows up in the "Games &amp; subscriptions" in your account settings?
---
I'm not at my computer and won't be till tomorrow.

I keep refreshing the page 4-5 times a day, but I don't really know if it will ever show up there, or if it's just in the desktop launcher?

Can anyone answer this?
---
Thank you, glad you liked it! I had a lot of fun making it!
---
Cast bars and boss mods did exist in vanilla.
---
&gt; Neither of my accounts currently are active

I think this means you cannot receive an invite
---
How many times you played at blizzcon? Were you ever sponsored?
---
What has the sub become? Motivate yourself... You either want to play it or you don't. It appears you fall into the latter category.

    [H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)  
---
While wanting to relive past   heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress   at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our   raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to   maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have   minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and   coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of   skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week   raiding schedule.
---
Off nights are to be   spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course,   doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to   burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming   consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over   rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders   of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership   experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)  
---
    Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!  
---
**Loot System:**
---
    Loot Council  
---
**Our Goal:**
---
    To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment.  
---
**Requirements:**
---
    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)  
---
    Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)  
---
    Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)

I'm looking for a guild that will raid either during the day or during the night after midnight.
---
I work 4pm to midnight EST and I want to find a guild with people that are in a similar situation who can't raid in the evening. I can change my sleep pattern to be available either during the day or during the night.
---
I know that back in the day every guild on my server raided in the evening but I'm sure there are people out there in the same situation as me and if we decide to all play on the same server we should be able to get 50ish active people necessary to raid consistently.
---
I've already booked 3 weeks off work when classic launches. My plan is to have 1 60 by the end of September. I'm still hesitating between maining a dwarf priest or a gnome mage.
---
I played vanilla from week 2 of it's release all the way threw. My main was a rogue and I was in a raiding guild that killed all the bosses in AQ40 and completed Naxx up until 4 Horsemen. I'm hoping for a guild that's competent enough to have MC/Ony on farm before BWL comes out.
---
Im not sure how viable this will be but I want to build a tanky priest that spams shadowword and mind control. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusiboZbhtcZV0g
---
For a minmaxing PVPer, a little. For a minmaxing PVEer, barely anything unless you're an Alliance side Priest.

Hunters were good, but had a steep learning curve with what and to use when. You had to play very aggressive but be top notch with your kiting game. In Arena(after vanilla) they pretty much mostly got shit on and there were absolutely always better choices. In open-world pvp and duels, they were great if you were good back in the vanilla days. You'd probably still lose against a Paladin or Warlock though. PvE wise I always was within the top 5 DPS and using gear not catered for such. I can't wait to start one up again. Worst case scenario, I make a rogue : P
---
If I remember correctly, item level wasn't visible in classic. I think it could be extrapolated based on stats etc... but, maybe I'm misremembering. 
---
I don't remember even knowing what item level gear was until part way through wrath.
---
I say human cause storm wind has a huge port
---
Sure that could happen, though I'd argue that the beauty of vanilla pvp is in how many different ways there are to get an advantage beyond sheer stats, but as good as the honour gear is it isn't the best. Raid gear will do you just as well in most cases.
---
I think the real issue is you've fallen in to the trap of thinking that the only content that matters is the cutting edge of endgame. It's nothing to feel bad about, Blizzard themselves fell in to the trap of assuming that there's only hardcore raiding/pvp and those who log in to do their dailies only and nothing in between - but vanilla is so much more than that. You just sort of gloss over the level 60 experience outside of raiding/pvp:
---
&gt;You hit lvl 60, prepare your gear by crafting, some pvp, 5 man dungeons, and then you have to choose raiding or farming honor
---
Most people in vanilla wow didn't actually raid. Of those who did, few made it past Blackwing Lair and fewer past AQ. The majority of the playerbase didn't do much more than just run 5man dungeons and casual pvp and they enjoyed their time just fine. There's so much you can do to make your own fun: play the auction house, collect all pets, gear a twink, max out all your reps, become the best crafter on the server, and just mess around with friends. If you do decide to hardcore raid then you can mix things up - sure you've tanked Naxx, but have you healed it? Even if you have healed it, have you *really*? Healing as a Paladin is very different from a Priest. Theorycraft the hell out of things, stacking shadow damage is too normie how about an all fire damage comp with fire mages and destrolocks? (more viable than you'd think). Druid tank raids. Shaman Tank dungeons. Hell, try and shaman tank raids. On and On.
---
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
---
It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats--the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill--The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it--and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden, and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.
---
This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but he gained--well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.
---
The mother of our particular hobbit--what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit--of Bilbo Baggins, that is--was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbitlike about them, and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.
---
Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo's father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his make-up from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably.
---
I'll probably consume it in more moderation if they let me in

Betas haven't  actually been for bug testing for a while now. They're more for publicity.

Those are rookie numbers you gotta push them up.

Woah wait, your girlfriend has a 2010 account and got a beta invite? Are you sure she didn't create the account earlier, and just not start playing as much until then?

It's just that I haven't seen *anyone* get in from 2006 or beyond

Not a fan of addons in classic =( macro and script are fine tho, they were something big back then.

Well. Doubt they invite more EU xD

Night Elves should be deleted in classic.

I'm torn between prot warrior which I used to play in vanilla and tbc and a shadow priest.

The only reason I'm thinking shadow is because I know they are viable in pve and they are good at 1v1 pvp also. This is why i need the beta. Gotta figure this out before release. What are you going to play?

I ran as a Nightelf to Elwynn Forest so many times. It is doable, just mind your pathing and good luck!

I dont feel sorry for them at all, is my point. Boo hoo its not as fun but I get to work from home playing a video game.
---
Pay vs Quin + Erik*
---
Server counts are going to be small and server capacity is going to be quite large (larger than servers during Vanilla), so it's possible there won't be cross realm BGs.
---
this shit is getting old
---
I‘ve not tested it, but shaman mostly relies on wf proccs.
---
Warrior is not that luck depended. Additionally warrior can also use wf with a shaman in group.
---
Anyway, that‘s just my opinion and surely is depended of the position in the guild/raid
---
No, because I don't care what 2 douchbags do on their stream and I will never watch them.
---
I think it should be part of classic. People think classic is about recreating vanilla exactly as it is, but I think it is really only about recreating the experience of playing it. 
---
I don’t see how adding a UI element is going to stop that, especially when it seems like some people were already doing that via addon. 
---
But I didn’t play end-gamw vanilla, so maybe my opinion is invalid.
---
Absolute madman. I love it.
---
[put me out of my misery already](http://www.wagerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/salt-to-the-wound-300x234.jpg)
---
This is the picture that inspired me to buy the game in Costco at 14 years old.
---
EU or NA
---
Human is significantly better for tank because of sword skill.
---
maybe have a server like this after naxx is out and things get stale. Each month the level cap goes up by ten.
---
wrongo.
---
Anything to do with pop balance all depends on the server. Horde generally has an advantage but of course Alliance will end up with a few servers they "control" as well
---

---
Your post history is a giant troll, don't listen to this dude.
---
I just want Kara
---
Yes, Totems are not supposed to be dying from AoE.
---
NE can panic shadowmeld when pulls go south, human can only die
---
Im right there with you, man :(
---
He went from "It's a novel idea, I'll maybe play it on the side" to seemingly having more fun tanking low level dungeons than he has playing anything new in recent memory
---
I keep thinking the same thing to be perfectly honest.  I probably won't have any time to play because I'll be starting a too demanding job in sept.  It's why I was kind of hyped for a July release.
---
Awesome. Thank you.
---
i started playing in 2006
---
that moment when you realise 13 years ago is not long enough lol
---
I really hope they don't add realm xfers to the classic servers, to me it was the beginning of the destruction of what WoW was. Suddenly guilds up and left and long time guild members that had been nurtured to become main tanks and the likes started leaving because they was getting invited to "mega" guilds on different servers, causing many guilds to get set back too far and inevitably disband.
---
Chromaggus was even better - every class with a debuff removal had to get involved. Shamans with poison cleansing totem were gods.
---
Yes that's what I'm talking about. I was wrong about the stealth one.
---
This is why I bought WoW. I thought hunters could use big explosive ammo rounds or something as an end game ammunition.
---
I’ve had an account subbed since 2007 and haven’t got one so I wouldn’t hold your breath
---
This sounds insane!!
---
I'm glad Im yet to experience that haha
---
Prot warrior would be awesome...I envy the warriors I really want one but I've never been a tank in my life so it's gonna have to be my alt.  It's really hard to pick a class...I was thinking Rogue...then Warlock...then I thought, fuck man just play Hunter it's going to be so fun to level, then if I get bored I'll make a more hardcore alt like a Rogue and then a Warrior.  As you can see I'm also torn, lol...I want to play Orc bc I like their looks and racials but back in the day I played as Tauren and I love Mulgore...bah!
---
CT Raid, KTM Threat Meter are two I remember
---
the fact that you just suggested that tells more than you think.
---
Death Knight
---
Can't ban you from a Classic forum if you don't play a Classic class
---
I’m calling bullshit
---
Sure, he's a good player, but him and his guild are insanely destructive to any server they join.
---
This is why NA will always be better
---
so mage\_boy not gurl?
---
Im sure by December it will double :)
---
No it doesn't even have this
---
We're talking about lag, not frame rate
---
It’s great for messing up your DRs and nothing else.
---
I was playing in december 2004 through tbc and you don't hear me crying
---
If you're NA, you'll want to check back around 6 PM PST. This seems to be an EU only wave (Hence the time the invites went out, early AF on west coast, evening time in EU)
---
That would be around the time when IF NA invites go out they would come out.
---
Really you should just check once a day at like 7 PM.
---
I had no idea it was capped at 30.. Are they going to raise the cap or reset characters first?
---
Fuck the haters I hope we keep getting these authentic screenshot updates well into Molten Core at least!
---
When did you sub?
---
Sorry for being ignorant but isn't that Axe for level 40? what's the point of getting it? does the BETA will allow ppl to go over 30?
---
I was trying to find old videos showing melee tooltips as well as using my own memory, and I think "Melee Range" only came about after TBC, likely with Cataclysm.  I suspect this was because melee is more obvious when you're in and out of range, and they didn't want people to be too confused about melee range scaling with target size.
---
Before then, using 5y made sense because of being the minimum range like you say, but now I'm wondering why wouldn't they just say 11-35y for Hunter shots?  So ugh, I don't know either now.  I am now pretty interested in learning how this works, though, but that'd take an explanation from a dev.
---
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wrw3c2NjeE
---
at least you can still run back 50% faster when you die i guess...
---
They left in the auto complete of names while mailing, for thr same reason as multi item mail. Not game breaking, just tedious mailing removal.
---
So i should go enchanting and herbalism
---
And she might take alchemy and skinning?
---
How does it sound
---
I'm convinced most people on this sub are savants or special needs
---
definitely lies.
---
Warcraftlogs and wowprogress will most likely get a classic wow database when it releases
---
It's a really tough choice. 
---
The only thing keeping me from going prot warrior is the fact that I cant really pvp as prot and the respec cost is to much to change specs all the time. 
---
That's why i like the idea of shadow. 
---
But I will probably end up rolling prot warrior in the end, it's what I have always mained so why stop now. 
---
I played all the classes during the wow demo and i have to say hunter was the most fun to level along with mage i found. 
---
I just dont hear good things about hunter In late game so that kinda turns me off from playing one.
---
Yeah, but they were awful compared to modern aura, and I don't even think they were accurate for bosses.
---
It was nothing compared to DBM or whatever addons is in retail now, and Blizz should keep it authentic and block anything but simple addons
---
After the beta first started did you sub?
---
Methodjosh has a good following and has said method will spend some time in classic. He's not Asmongold/Soda/etc but he gets thousands of viewers.
---
Both classes struggle undergeared priests will shine in every aspect where as Paladins will be fine in 5 mans but are the Best tank Healers. Paladins do not have aoe heals or hits or shields.
---
Skarm is kind of a noob though
---
He clicks on last stand and shield wall
---
Hemo/Asa is the only good sword pvp spec. It still requires good gear to be effective. Early on you’ll mostly see dagger rogues.
---
Tens of thousands disagree with you
---
I mean there's been tons of people that have gotten in after even non vanilla accounts get in.
---
Nah man we grew up already, raiding ICC every week gets real old after a while when everyone has known all the encounters for many years
---
Theres np with that imo. If a BiS of mine drops i take it, same for me. Leveling wont be an item problem
---
OG player here, active OG account. Still no invite.
---
what is sperg?
---
Hunter is one of the most popular classes on every private server.
---
While weapon skill is more effective, it really shines for fury warriors more than anything.
---
If tanking is your thing, you can definitely play any race and succeed. Pick the one that looks the best to you. You will stare at that toon for many an hour.
---
If by best looking you mean "poor some bleach into my eyes" bad then yes definitely.
---
You won't be able to relive your childhood, that's a one-time only event, no way around that.
---
BUT
---
You'll be able to have a lot of fun with things you're passionate about, how to do it it's up to you.
---
i actually had a ne war alt back then only thing i really used the meld for was pvp stuff like in av
---
i dont think it has any real pve use
---
I wonder if the reddit swarm will detect sarcasm. Good luck!
---
The official WoW forums, but it was posted constantly on every WoW forum by people who hated Vanilla and didn't want Classic servers to happen.
---
Do u have a link?
---
I guess i dont understand the need to cap.
---
The max level is 30. So they are basically doing endgame pvp. Whirlwind axe is BIS on the beta
---
They are one of the best classes for prolonged fights as well, just like warlocks.
---
assuming they don't break their bows or run out of arrows...
---
feign death -&gt; eating/drinking mid combat, and obv the threat reduction allows them to DPS continuously without overaggroing
---
He’s correct. Whatever base stat difference exists at one is the same at 60 assuming all else is equal. 
---
Stat growth is based on class. Not race.
---
If you say so dude, I don't know a single person who got in so can't really tell.
---
Odds are it was EU only. Only seen EU. And the timing is way off for NA people.
---
This was around 10:30 AM PST. The NA invites have been going out around 6 PM PST. It's evening time in EU, which makes sense, as all invites go out for that region in their native evening time.
---
All three NA waves to this point were around 6 PM PST. So if there is an NA wave coming, it won't be until around 7 hours from now. Emphasis on IF, they may feel they have enough NA until the stress test, but who knows.
---
For sure about Hunter...Warrior is so badass as an Orc too :)  Good luck!!
---
Good plan until blizzard gives us the shaft and pushes it back to 2020
---
"When spells such as Find Minerals are activated they show as 'buffs' and not as an icon on the minimap "
---
I distinctly remember this being a thing in vanilla, not a bug imo.
---
These is video of Tips tanking dungeon. He basically didnt tank at all. He pulled like 6 mobs every time then let mobs hit anybody and nobody was taking any damage just like in bfa. Its not just tanks.
---
Yeah, my point is why roll on a PvP server and then complain about PvP?
---
He's a bad player that only knows how to colect mounts and do achievments on retail, he was never famous for being any kind of PvP'r at all. A PvE server is the best for him.
---
Anyone got invited with a token subscription? Starting to feel like you needed to buy an actual subscription and the tokens don't count. big FML.
---
hehe yes you got me I'm just kidding
---
It’s more that it’s so predictable that he turns bitchy when he faces a player that vastly outskills him. I think he got something to think about regarding PvP servers last night - they might actually make the game unplayable for him.
---
So in current wow, pets have issues where they wont attack something if you engage a target and switch to passive 
---
You have to set then to assist and then resummon them 50% of the time... otherwise they can stay on passive
---
I can also confirm that logging into the battle.net client works 100% of the time
---
I’m just looking forward to experience.
---
Correct. I resubbed Frida
---
There are cases of older accounts getting beta access but it's usually streamers, f&amp;f. Asked a streamer yesterday and she said that she started playing in cata and has had the beta since it's release.
---
I swear! My dad works for Nintendo, dude!  Gabe Newell?  Ever heard of him?
---
I need Bengay!
---
Cool thanks!  So mana pool difference is so small at 60 it makes no difference, and the difference in health pool would be more so attributed to the Tauren’s racial that increases health by 5% or however it works...
---
Omg. Wailing Caverns. Memories, sweet sweet memories &lt;3
---
Lights Hope
---
Pretty sure your wrong my main reason for playing is to kick the raids asses because I only ever saw ragnaros once.
---
No, I do not assume that. But if you dont need gear to do the hardest content, why have gear with stats at all? You could say the same for mythic+, you play to push the highest keys, not to obtain gear (as a goal).  
---
In PvP we already have this. It shouldnt be about gear, it should be about rating and skill; said a ton of people. Now we have effectively no gear in PvP, just set stats instead.  
---
I disagree with the two last paragraphs completely. Sure, for some people raiding was all about boss progression, but I dont think it started out that way for most. I think most players back in Vanilla wanted to be as strong as they could be in this world. They did quests and levelled all the way up to 60. Alright, how to I become stronger now? Dungeons. Crafting. Okay, im already strong.. but I can still go further! Raids. Raids was the final step in the progression ladder. Now that the ladder has been removed, and everything scales and gear is pretty much a meaningless number.. well, the incentive to raid is gone for a lot of people, and character progression died with it; and so did the interest in the game.

You're going to want Mining if you wish to spec to Engineering. Skinning without Leatherworking is only useful for passive gold acquisition, so I'd replace Skinning with Mining.
---
nice man looks like things are going to work as intended
---
Lootable corpses would be great. Risk/reward for murder, or just get lucky and loot someone who died from a wolf.
---
I just started on northdale for the same reasons
---
If you used the spacebar you "jump", but if you use both mouse button and aim up you "swim" is how I remember it.
---
&gt;level 1
---
when I first played WoW back in the days to me it was so bizarre that there was stuff that you could download in to the game that made it easier to play and it was allowed. To me it felt like cheating and it still does.  
---
Only thing I would allow is UI appearance changes. Nothing else should be allowed and that's not me being elitist in my opinion.  To me it feels kinda in Counter-strike I would see my recoil pattern as dots displayed on the screen or a line that would tell me where to pull my mouse to handle the recoil. I mean the game already gives you the information because the recoil pattern is always the same but it should be up to the player to execute these moves with the info provided. "PRESS NOW" is like someone coaching you all the time whos only job is time your swings, then another guy who is keeping eye on the healing cooldowns to tell you when to heal.  
---
Add ons are pretty much like multiple people staring at the screen playing together but instead of someone yelling you what to do you have it calculated on computer speeds and displayed on your screen.
---
Can you recommend a Youtube channel that mainly focuses on vannila endgame?
---
Im thinking about going skinning and herba for leveling, maximizing gold and its easier. She might take alchemy and mining?
---
No one ever expects the Night elf shadowmeld gank which is a big + for hilarity and the 1% dodge is a thing, but the human weapon skill bonuses mean you get more consistant rage generation which translates to way more dps, mitigation, more everything than you would expect.
---
Krypparian said he was going to play Classic WoW.
---
I think that might be really cool, but ion said in some recent interview there was zero chance for it.
---
I didn't want it originally, but it might be a really cool addition for when vanilla has kind of "run its course".
---
Hi, /u/CristophRiz
---
Yah he even said so himself lol. He's not interested in doing pvp at all he just wants the axe
---
I was just thinking about Mage/Warlock. I feel like you could do some shenanigans to cut down on overall travel time a ton.
---
Human wep skill for bettwr threat generation. 
---
The 1% NE dodge isn't going to help anybody.
---
Ty!
---
But i cannot track minerals and herbs at the same time :(
---
FeelsBadMan EU here, didn't get in
---
YEAH! Ended up an absolute requirement for all people with decurse. Awesome.
---
the quality of posts on this subreddit has hit an all time low
---
I just don't like where the game is these days.
---
I'm sure it's my nostalgia goggles talking.
---
I try not to use memory as anything for judgement. I'm merely basing what "should" be the deadzone off of the tooltips and things stated by players back then about the dead zone. It's not like I found anything that said "the min range was actually 10-11 yards" and I feel like if that were the case someone somewhere would have brought it up when it was a big deal. I mean that's basically double the expected deadzone how could you not notice that? :P It would just seem wrong to me that their stated range is 8-35, but really its 11-35? The same should be true for warriors as well, as charge is 8-25 range. Is warrior charge 10-11 yards or is it 8? Man I wish I had beta to test this stuff :(
---
There are none
---
Last time around it felt like the Horde was the underdogs... Not anymore. This time around they will be over populated I think. I am going alliance for this reason.
---
I think this is blatant evidence that this is working as intended and it's alarming how few people are linking this video.
---
He explained it in the post.
---
Level 30 gameplay is different from level 60 gameplay.
---
Boss mods were fantastic, and helped immensely back then.  They were fairy accurate (tho if you died/dropped combat your timers could be thrown off).  I really don’t understand the hatred for boss mods on here, like why is it so important to try to limit the flow of information?
---
Should we also make people pay for a ventrilo server because they didn’t have free solutions like discord back then?
---
Should we not allow people to use 144hz monitors?
---
Where do you draw the line?
---
You forgot to include Warchief Venruki  who called the strats for most of the battle and led his flank push to be the biggest contributors to the battle.
---
Alliance is easier, so 1 argument could be horde offers more of a challange
---
Oh yes.
---
I guess my point is when live comes out this gets replaced with end game pvp. I dont see the difference.  We then have twinks in bgs
---
Institutionalized racism, omegalul.
---
HORDE OR DEATH, MOTHERFUCKER.  ORC MASTER RACE.
---
Initially they wanted them in TBC, but didn't feel comfortable adding a new class to the game at the time.
---
To be fair, most horde spent their time idling around in durotar - so it counts.
---
Under Orgrimmar? I think you needed a mount or a speed boost to pull that off though.
---
Ha! Now I know you’re lying because my dad is Nintendo!
---
I'm training at my local gym so my body can stand the lack of sleep and junk food. I think its a great warm up
---
Monkeynews and Sonydigital are probably at the top. Hard to tell for sure though.
---
I mean, between the entire quest list, zone layouts, leveling speed, itemization, skills and abilities, talent trees.... yeah, it feels like a completely different game to me.
---
Well..that sucks. But it is just for testing. Gotta be patient. Itll be worth it!!
---
Read it all through and I agree with you on every point. Very nice upgrades for the locks and the rest of the caster/healers. Especially that BRD hit belt. That one is OP. Some items become magic without progressive itemization!   
---
I'm going to keep sash of whispering secrets as it is, for the same reason as you pointed out with volatile power. It really is just &gt;slightly&lt; better than mana igniting cord and there is no alternative for the other casters.  
---
Thanks a ton for the input! Really! &lt;3
---
Can we start banning low-effort memes? The last thing we need is another sub that turns into a meme-echochamber and cesspit.
---
All the pservers I've looked at are pvp and favor alliance.
---
They have Pally buffs, which heavily outclass shaman totems buffs
---
As the OP mentioned it only started being this way since Legion and it certainly still is like that in BfA
---
heh vanilla wow was directly responsible for me not finishing my last 2 years of school.
---
Welcome EU folks!  Glad y'all are getting in! :D
---
Alliance will still be higher pop, they're more popular on every private server I've been on, they're still more popular on retail, and they were more popular back in the day.
---
Not by much, and it varies server to server, but horde generally has fewer players and I doubt that'll change for classic.
---
As someone who spoiled the fresh experience with private servers, I am embracing the beta as my time to do a little testing and preparing for the early level grind.
---
If I was in your situation though, having not played private servers, I would also wait to play and savor that rush you get when you first log in.
---
The thing about streamers is that I feel like you could probably watch without ruining the experience if you do so selectively. Someone of them do more talking and running around ironforge than anything which can be just as fun.
---
Shut up before I ankle pick you
---
so is anyone actually watching bfa?

2007 here... might be a while before I get in... lol
---
I would love to see a simple focus frame addon that has a castbar included.
---
Started day 3 EU launch, no invite!
---
i love this loading screen because they took the time to draw fucking masterpieces for all the races except the gnome which is literally an ingame screenshot.
---
You seem to have forgotten the most overpowered class for speedeveling; mage that can aoe farm.
---
:(
---
Yea bro, you and your friends are going to be the biggest loss Blizzard has ever faced. How dare they roll the price into one fee!!
---
You're not? You'll have Enchanting Mining, and she'll have Alchemy Herbalism.
---
I had a troll hunter named Twojoints back in BC and after about a year of playing him, someone reported me and i was forced to name change. Had a GM on chat who could not/would not explain to me exactly what the issue was with the name but that it was just against the ToS. I appealed stating I am "double-jointed". He wouldnt budge.  
---
Meanwhile, hundreds of alcohol themed toons everywhere.  
---
I fucking hate reefer madness.
---
I mean just lvl gear like 4stam 4 agil boots you can make while lvling to make it easier on you, also no pre-bis from LW?
---
Obviously trolling
---
Just got invited. EU, Launch day account.
---
WHY IS EVERYONE in this thread getting in? im a 2004 EU acc active sub, i get squat
---
You can't say the name of a P Server here on this subreddit or your comment gets auto-deleted.
---
But you can rhyme, Knights Rope.
---
Twice as many as the wowservers private server subreddit. Its crazy how this exploded.
---
You're going to be below the level cap for a very long time and you're going to like it!
---
He's picked the right faction and he knows it, nothing you can do. Go back to your dirt huts you shoeless horde scum.
---
...Do people like you really exist? Jesus fucking christ, what is happening to this world?
---
Bro, do u imgur?
---
Wowhead lists them as 1k hp also.. even though in your video they're taking well over 1k damage before dying.
---
The *other* databases list them around 3k hp. Blizzard REALLY needs to fix elites.
---
nice.
---
Someone will make a QuestHelper type addon for Classic, it's gonna happen 100%.
---
blizzard way too smart to sell themselves short. vote with your wallet, maybe they will change
---
Well you could not have read it to well.
---
1. I got my beta invite on Friday, collector edition US from day 1.
---
2.  Blizzard could with the resources it has can provide a solution to involve everyone who wants to partake in the beta. Irrespective to how beta's have worked in the past and the amount of people that would have to be included.
---
3. If you think making beta exclusive and alienating people from partaking and contributing is a fair move when there are viable alternatives, good for you.
---
 I don't think it will make a difference at the end of the day but it gives one some insight into how blizzard views things and to me its rather concerning. not to mention the whole"make sure you are subbed for a chance thing" scummy move.
---
Just not going to happen, sub has been the same cost since the game came out. No amount of complaining is going to change blizz's mind.
---
he was doing it with a party of 5 originally and then the whole "raid on Asmongold" started when the Horde streamers found out he was doing the quest and wanted to impede his progress.
---
Ooh i understood it wrong. Yep, thats true
---
I rarely watch streams on twitch, but like youtube if I do its on another screen while playing a game - I assume a lot of people are the same. It's like putting a show or movie on while you grind.
---
This is how it's always been so I dont know why this surprises you? At least its 1 subscription for 2 games.
---
Not at all lol. If burnout was the case then it wouldn't feel rewarding getting loot from vanilla/BC/wotlk servers, which I do still feel a sense of reward from, even after playing all those expansions for a long ass time.
---
Now I wonder, how would the Demon Hunter class have looked if they released it with the base game like in this screenshot?
---
Type asmongol reacts on YouTube you will find them.
---
This was pretty good . thanks for the laugh
---
Hi, /u/taylorswiffer25
---
I've always assumed they had less in retail since their wait times are less for BGs
---
Try and make friends. It’s not a solo game.
---
Oh i see. Wouldnt skinning and LW be better for her since she can make leather armor for both of us?
---
And i can lvl mining and enchanting
---
Sorry I didn't watch every video and mainly used Asmongold footage. Didn't make much preperation and just started writing. I guess you could say this is from the view of an Alliance historian ;)
---
Collector's edition owner.. no invite yet :(
---
humans are by far the best choice. the human spirit racial is just an added bonus for rep grinding too, plus the racial to break CC is great. 1% dodge and NR are very negligible and shadowmeld is 100% useless for tanking
---
Lucky asf, my wife doesn't want to play games
---
I had no idea about that, that is really interesting to me. I also do not hate instanced content. Hell, I genuinely like Guild Wars, though I would not call it an MMO like a lot of people. I always liked the way classic tended (though obviously not always) to hide its instances behind a bunch of elites. It felt like you had fought your way to the heart of an enemy lair and connected it to the rest of the world. I always thought that was just a clever piece of design and world building. I did not realise that it was likely a response to potential critics of instanced content breaking the feel of a cohesive world.

the most recent 50k are all carebear circlejerk meme plebs
---
Woot!
---
Its a real shame this huge 80v80 battle didn't happen because the server hardware cant handle it anymore and Classic WoW won't bring the authentic world PvP because cloud servers and.....
---
**OH WAIT**
---
The overhead arrow does but not the crosshairs circle on the hit box.
---
you basically get classic for free as long as you sub to bfa. if you were to sub to classic it would still be $15/month
---
Its $15 or less if you buy the subs in bulk.\
---
I suppose they could to an upfront cost, but it would be about $360 or so.
---
It was a 3gb download so don’t get too stressed.
---
Imagine the shit storm that would ensue if beta testers were lvl 60 decked out in blues ganking lvl 1s on official release. Kinda obvious it would wipe.
---
Account has to have game time 1 time to be able to get into beta. if it will be your first time with an active sub go ahead. otherwise waste
---
You might be right, but in my head it's kinda like... Private servers popped up, and were the only option for vanilla. So you play them. They get shut down eventually, and you move on to the next, et cetera. You always hope this will be the last, so you are motivated every time...
---
But now it's official, and unless blizz fucks it up, this is the server to play. So this is the first time people will get a good vanilla server to play in perpetuity, kind of the first time a large amount of people will get the chance to actually play it until they get tired of it.
---
You don't have to agree but I hope you see what I mean. All that said, maybe it won't be the case at all, it's just something I've been thinking about.
---
I can only speak for myself, I played during vanilla, I played to 60 on a private server, and I'm excited for classic. But I'm not gonna start over and over and over, and I'm not going to play a stagnant game for the rest of eternity. I can only assume how I think the general playerbase will feel about things.
---
Anyway, just my thoughts. :)
---
2007. still not in
---
burnout's never the \*only\* reason, but it's often the least considered reason
---
I mean, who likes to admit anything is 'their fault'? Who likes to admit that those first weeks we spent playing 14 hours a day and going at it like gangbusters also contributed to burnout?
---
nostalgia vs burnout. nostalgia very much can win
---
Fuck yea weapon swing! This and moveanything are all I need!
---
I don't know? Why are you asking me?
---
Uh please no... Don't change something some of us old pvpers loved.
---
You might as well give up. If you read through this thread, all you see is people shitting on the evil streamers who will destroy their precious Classic experience. They are acting as if someone is interjecting into their lives. It's fucking pathetic to look at.
---
Rogue on Paper is the second best class behind Warrior for DPS in Classic. Even with the Dot Limit they just go combat and spam SS.
---
It feels especially janky because it isn't at all consistent, sometimes the pet will react immediately, even when it is currently "busy".
---
I got invited. 
---
Created account day 1. Actived played until october 2018, then unsubbed and only resubbed 2-3 days ago.
---
I know someone who subbed after the beta started and they got in. It doesn't matter when you sub. Once you sub you're in the pool.
---
Wait we aren't even allowed to talk about the primary quest hub in Eastern Plaugelands?
---
At some point weren't they going to make it a warrior talent choice as well? Thought I read that somewhere, maybe I'm crazy
---
They get fed gold and gear etc - so progression can sometimes be easier for them. They basically have an army of minions to do their bidding - making it easier for them. Though sometimes it can also mean they have an army of people harrassing them.
---
When it's known what server they are on, people watching generally flood that server and follow them around - if the streamer runs an "event" this can even crash servers. Asmongold has crashed wow servers are few times doing this.
---
For classic servers, I think the biggest thing will be on PvP servers where streamers will have a literal army of people to world PvP for them. It just sort of throws things out of balance where things aren't how they would "naturally be"
---
Your wrong if you think that the people in Beta are all big streamers.
---
If you can't justify it, you clearly don't want it enough.
---
As long as you have an active subscription before the wave goes out, you could technically get an invite.
---
But most people getting the invite are OG first year vanilla players.
---
Bingo
---
That's also fine.
---
&gt; they might actually make the game unplayable for him.
---
i mean, i wouldn't be surprised if they *did*. just use yesterday as an example: he was just trying to do a quest in a contested zone on a very-limited population beta. admittedly, there's not much else to do at 30 on the beta, so, that's part of the reason... but i could imagine people constantly hounding him to slow his progress, even other Alliance that'll purposely tag/kill the mobs he needs for quests, etc. Sodapoppin said the same thing, more or less.
---
If it was F2P or B2P they would have to put crappy microtransactions into it because infrastructure maintenance is not free, you know? No thank you.
---
Exactly. Also GUI stands for graphical user interface :P
---
&gt; You can also get a skeletal war horse from stratholme's baron rivendare
---
I have never been so triggered in my entire life. For years I grinded for his mount but the cuck always took it with him to the grave, I think my true dream of classic might he winning this mount.
---
&gt;So the fact that Classic will most likely have an expiration date means that some people believe it is not worth starting.
---
You seem to have the inside scoop lol
---
I believe asmongold said he's gonna play a PvE server anyways.
---
For being in 800x600, that UI is pretty clean!
---
Agreed.
---
I am currently testing the Beta version of the Battle.net launcher and I have yet to encounter a single bug. Really outstanding work, imo.
---
Are stress tests ''open betas''?
---
Recommending/encouraging private servers is not allowed here, try /r/wowservers.
---
Except the enemy warrior.
---
Madseason is US I am pretty sure.
---
Its better to play with a friend than it is to have the faction you prefer, 100%. I'd just bite the bullet and play Alliance.
---
What's the point to life?
---
I prefer fuskbugg. Much quicker and easier to upload. But i could post it to imgur aswell.

R.I.P. Druids

**Benevolent Elephants**. A US Alliance, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy. Accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number 1 goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Casual members/PvPers/non-raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: 2 raid nights to be decided once majority get close to 60. However they will be 2 of Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursdays. (With a possible 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: Also to be decided once majority get close to 60, but somewhere in the 6:30pm-12am PST range. For 3-4 hours
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord
---
* Loot: Loot Council, decisions made public in a member read only discord page, to help transparency. Or publicly in the main discord voice channel. Exactly details on the transparency to be fine tuned over time. 
---
Contact us:
---
* Discord: https://discord.gg/tyQpeJ3
---
To clarify, the minimum range would be 11, but the maximum range would also be increased to 1.5+1.5+35=38. I would guess that Charge/Intercept are affected similarly, and some comments on the tauren extra combat reach support this hypothesis, but I also can't provide any conclusive proof.
---
I'd argue it's actually bigger for tanks. A fury war with +wep skill increases the dps of 1 raid member, a tanking war with +wep skill raises the agro cap for 20ish raid members.
---
Bout time, literally only EU content creators for the first week of the damn beta is pretty disingenuous.
---
Same. RP realms always had a more chill community anyways and it'll only be better without any streamers.
---
You must have an active sub. Blizzard has stated this.
---
isnt that pretty much everywhere on reddit at this point?
---
My group played Alliance from Vanilla-Wrath &amp; then played horde from Cata-BFA. 
---
We love the horde, so naturally we were going to play horde for classic. But after thinking about it, the Alliance is where all of our Vanilla nostalgia is from and the barrens sucks. So we ended up deciding to play Alliance.
---
So check which faction has your nostalgia and remember the barrens sucks and maybe it’ll help you decide.
---
It's actualy 100% worth it cuz your gonna ding lvl 2 by just getting xp from exploring.
---
Uh........
---
If you played since day one you would know World PVP was definitely a thing. Especially on Tuesday/Wednesday during raid hours. The front of ZG/BRM use to be some of the most fun I had.
---
Also, World PVP definitely happened all through classic and even TBC. Silithus was a war zone in some spots. Devilsaur faming also led to a few fun skirmishes.
---
No battlegrounds will ruin world pvp like it did in the past.
---
Kara was the only raid I did in TBC. Mostly because I was so burned out after playing Vanilla for years that I couldn't be bothered
---
Anyone think you have a higher chance of getting picked if your account is connected to social media? For that extra sweet marketing
---
no you didn't
---
Rugir is playing enhance
---
For my Rogue I’m planning on going skinning / mining while I level and then swapping mining for engineering at 60. That way I can be an ass and use my engineering gadgets to help fight people for Devilsaurs &gt;:D
---
Zone has good flow and some amazing grinding down south with the two large quillboar camps.  You're in for a treat.
---
HEY, This guy likes BFA! GET EM BOYS!
---
Everyone will blame you for ninja pulling and your tank will hate you if you keep growl on.
---
&gt;Where do you draw the line?
---
I would definitely draw the line at cast-bars, and I know there was this natur addon or whatever it was called that had some text "X is casting Y spell" or something like that, but I don't think it should be a part of the game.
---
And I also don't think the old DBM were nearly as accurate as the modern one, like on fights like Chromaggus it didn't call out their current vulnerability.
---
I am not against DPS or threat  meters as they were a part of vanilla, but there needs to be a limit or the addons will singlehandely kill classic.
---
The email usually shows up a day or 2 later. Check [www.battle.net](https://www.battle.net) or open the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher to see if you got it. In the launcher you'll see Beta: WoW Classic. It should be in the little drop down box above the Play button.
---
I think this is one of those cases we can look to pservers and relate it to what we might see in classic. That being said world pvp is very big on pvp pservers, even deep into patches, and I expect it to be similar.
---
Good point. I defined my terms rather poorly in my comment and am going to use your definitions here.
---
I remember using the "LFG" interface a lot in TBC and getting frustrated that no one else used it. Was that interface updated in WotLK as well as the implementation of LFD?
---
Its not the streamers themselves, I am talking about the massive community pull. No random pally could pull the numbers Asmongold could.
---
Now tomorrow we can see if invites are daily or weekly :)
---
No, he asked why people said something. I explained why.
---
Doesn't scale well in raids, dead zone is annoying as hell.
---
I actually factored it out intentionally. Reason being, from what I've seen from the beta. Increased respawn rates are not a thing. Mages tend to take advantage of this on private servers, generally when you kill many mobs in a large area they respawn quickly. This does not appear to be the case in retail. In other words, its 5 minutes for most aoe camps. Secondly some spots mages will usually grind are no longer viable, the Fire Roc's in Tanaris come to mind. Mobs that seemed to have been missing spells and abilities they otherwise should have had, use to not work on the emulation servers.
---
Overall I don't think mage leveling will be quite as quick as a Hunter or Warlock.
---
But thats just my two cents.
---
McConnell got in? Damn. Any streamers wanna be besties?
---
Per management and being called a “huntard”
---
Oh boy i remember having to do this.
---
Here you go. https://imgur.com/gallery/Dy6Bpbn
---
ok. To bad
---
The only major cons are middle of the pack damage and high skill cap (may not be viewed as a con to some people)
---
pfUI was elvUI for 1.12 client basically.  So why not just use elvUI in classic which will almost certainly be updated for it since it's far less work.
---
Mage Warlock, you have portals and summons, you will have endless group potential during leveling.
---
you are correct, i dont know what this dude above is on about. Alliance have always been less in population on ALL private servers, and especially in retail. Lower ques is standard for alliance because of this
---
Idk I've felt like this pretty much since WoD and the only expansion where I actually played a lot in the start was legion. Gear just doesn't feel rewarding anymore because it's either way too easy to get, or you can almost always get an upgrade, or your reward becoming hollow because someone else rolled the RNG dice and got a better one doing way easier content.
---
Dishonest!Verse says this was shitty and unimpressive. I loved missing boats back in the day.
---
I guess we can see tomorrow if its daily or weekly invites
---
Yeah we never had ZG and BRM before battlegrounds.  Ok so people killing each other waiting for raid to start is still a thing.  Skirmishes of 2 party’s has been a thing in retail also.
---
yup with gold
---
Dps, Pet micro, Ammo, and you are mana based dps class with low mana potential and little recourse to replenish mana unlike locks and mages.
---
I watched the whole thing from Asmongold's perspective as it was going down.  Some commentary....
---
&gt; Asmongold [...] managed to drive the Horde through the gate of Thoradins Wall at the western border of Arathi Highland
---
I think we should keep track of the objectives of the battle here.  Asmon and the Alliance were trying to acquire 24 items total here, 8 from air elementals, 8 from fire elementals, and 8 from water elements.  The Horde were trying to stop that.  Asmon got 6 charms from the air elementals before getting interrupted by the Horde.  Then, the skirmishes eventually led to the Horde being driven into Hillsbrad.  While the Alliance held the wall, Asmon got 6 charms from the fire elementals, until his army was eventually uprooted.
---
&gt; A flank lead by the Undead Archmage Venruki from the north took Asmongold and the Alliance forces completely by surprise and slaughtered almost every alliance member that defended the gate.
---
Kind of.
---
Esfand said something to the extent of, "Venruki!  At the north part of the wall!  Asmon, they're flanking!"  Then, Asmon declared that "everyone" was supposed to go and kill the (five or so) flankers.  The flankers got crushed.  The problem was that two-thirds or more of Asmon's army broke off from the wall to attack the flankers.  The people still guarding the gate got overrun by the Horde's actual army.  And then Asmon's group broke and ran and got crushed.  Afterwards, Asmon said, "Honestly, I didn't expect that so many people would help with the flankers."  Uhh... what?
---
&gt; Sonydigital [...] ordered a full-scale assault on Refuge pointe but it was immediately pushed back by the defending Alliance.
---
This was hilarious.  They were like lemmings jumping off of a cliff.  (Not that lemmings actually do that.)  But, to be clear, the reason the Horde got slaughtered was because of all the NPC guards who spawned and decimated them.
---
&gt; Asmongold took the opportunity to charge at the nearby Horde camp
---
Close.  They were chasing the Horde.  Eventually, Asmon realized that they were pushing into a Horde encampment, and called his troops back.  The Horde camp was never the goal for him, and he thought it was pretty stupid that his troops were running in there.
---
Also, around here, the servers hitched at least twice within a couple of minutes.  Each time, it was a few seconds of lag.  But I don't remember lag at any other times.
---
&gt; Victory was assured [for the Alliance]
---
No.  It wasn't.  It never felt like that.
---
&gt; but the armies of the alliance was betrayed by the human Towelliee, who convinced the mighty Fozruk to charge at the alliance forces.
---
I don't know for sure that it was Towelliee who did this.  That's who Asmon blamed.  But this whole thing was hilarious, because Asmon had *just* warned them all not to touch Fozruk.  Whoever did it, clearly did it to troll him.
---
&gt; Asmongold deemed the Mountain Giant to strong for the force present and ordered a general retreat back to Refuge Pointe.
---
In one of my favorite moments of the whole battle (and the hilariousness of this won't translate well into text), Asmon declared, as the army retreated from Fozruk back into the basin of Refuge Pointe, "We just made fools of ourselves!"
---
In fact, he had mostly negative things to say to his army throughout the whole thing.  Once in a while, when things went well (which they rarely did), he would tell them that they were doing great, and, once or twice, even that he hadn't meant the harsh things he'd said earlier.
---
&gt; General Tips went over his own ablilities and fell to the Alliance vanguard.
---
In context, this wasn't really interesting.  Tipsout repeatedly and entirely needlessly got himself killed.  Asmon seemed to make it a point to single him out in battle and kill him.
---
&gt; It was said that Asmongold ordered his troops to charge in a loose gaggle formation while running towards the fleeing Horde. True or not [...]
---
Oh, it was true, and it was hilarious!  He doubled down on the idea of everyone needing to form a "gaggle", while everyone under his command scratched their heads in confusion.  Asmon's loose formation fetish in the latter half of the battle developed from of the earlier slaughter at the gate, when Venruki demolished them with AoE.
---
&gt; Although Asmongold has used his influence to rally new recruits to his cause
---
Uhh, mostly not.
---
&gt; they had poor morale and strategic awareness
---
Uhh, mostly yes.
---
&gt; Asmongold struggled to keep the army unified.
---
&gt; The battle, now stationed just southeast of Refuge Pointe, began poorly for the Alliance field marshal. The new recruits charged and scattered making it hard for the veteran commander to gain ground.
---
Okay.  That might be Asmon's take on things.  And it might even be true.  But I will say that he spent an inordinate amount of time bitching at individual members of his raid for being separated from the group.  Pointing it out would be one thing, but he also went out of his way to openly insult them.  The guy who got it the worst was "Saur"-something (I don't remember the second half of his name).
---
On a similar note, at one point, they were fighting the Horde on the left side of a small mountain, and a group of Alliance was going around to the right side to flank the Horde, Asmon declared, "I don't know what you guys think you're doing, circling around like you're a fuckin'... secret agent or something.  Get back here!  ...Oh, that guy's pretty good.  Yeah, you keep doing what you're doing."
---
&gt; In the midst of the raging bloodbath, an Alliance Mage, name unknown, managed to cut off a big portion of the Horde with a mighty Frost Nova.
---
This happened, but I don't actually remember this being strategically or tactically relevant.  As I recall, few Alliance members took advantage of it.
---
&gt; causing the Horde to flee once again, this time west, towards and later past the gate of Thoradins Wall.
---
Mission update: While over here, Asmon acquired one more fire charm, bringing him up to 7/8.
---
&gt; The Horde army was depleted and gave up on gaining control for Arathi Highland.
---
Huh?
---
&gt; Asmongold, although badly wounded several times during the war, was satisfied and went back to Refuge Pointe to celebrate the victory.
---
Huh?  No.  He never went back to Refuge Pointe in anything but retreat.  He still needed one more fire charm from over by the wall!
---
&gt; Asmongold, during his victory speech
---
More of a pep talk and recruiting speech, really.  People were leaving his raid, and he couldn't muster new troops.  He repeatedly just went through his guild roster and mass-invited people, to little effect.
---
That said, he gave speeches on two or three different occasions.  And, honestly, they were fairly good, without being cheesy or over-the-top.  Much better than the speech that I saw from Sonii.
---
Also worthy of mention, around this time, there was a great call for Asmon to face Sonii in single combat.  Asmon refused, saying that he was certain to die, because he wasn't geared for it.  I think he was right.  Unlike Sonii, Asmon had neither a mail helm, nor a Whirlwind Axe.  And his gear might have been deficient in other ways that I didn't notice.
---
On the flip side of that, many people in Sonii's chat called for Sonii to accept Monkeynews as Asmon's champion, and to face *him* in single combat.  But Sonii didn't acknowledge those calls.  (I could be wrong about this.  I only watched Sonii's stream for a few minutes, only because I wanted to see the size of the Horde army.)
---
&gt; His final words were How many people do their have? Jesus Christ, they have so many!.
---
Indeed.  This was his complaint the whole battle: He just needed more people.  More people.  More people.  Throw more people.  Stop people.
---
IMO, his real problem was that the people he had just didn't care.  People were breaking off and skirmishing alone, probably because they were bored and wanted to do stuff.  They didn't care about helping him to get his axe.  Why should they?  He offered them nothing in return, and repeatedly belittled them, and barked narcissistic nonsense like, "Everyone [of the 200+ people online in this guild] should be here right now helping me!"... as if they had nothing better to do than serve his will.  The only thing in it for most of them was just the fun of PvP.  Meanwhile, the Horde had a clear goal: Kill Asmongold and stop him from getting the axe.  I expect that this helped them to recruit and retain people and get them to act orderly.
---
But your general description of this final fight is correct.  If Asmon had had some sense as a commander, while they waited around for about half an hour, trying to rally more troops, he should really have sent out scouts to figure out what the Horde was up to, and what their numbers were.  Him dashing off into that final fight was foolish, and ended exactly how it should have.  He was outnumbered.  He didn't have a chance in that fight, despite his confidence.

They don't send emails at all, just check whenever you get off work. :)

**&lt;Journey&gt;** Semi-hardcore | Server region: NA (PST) | Server type: PvE | Faction: Alliance
---
**Introduction:**  **Life and WoW are about the Journey, not the destination.** **We are a newly formed guild that fosters a community where every member wants to be part of the guild; evident through their actions and interactions in and out of the guild.** The leadership team has many years of experience running guilds in World of Warcraft going back to retail vanilla. We have raided and experienced all content up through AQ40 and will push further this time around.
---
**What we are looking for:**  Players who like to have fun outside of the raid but are hardcore when the raid commences. We optimally want a 50-person raid team who maintain a 70% attendance level. This includes being prepared with all appropriate consumables and raid spec etc.
---
**What we are aiming for:**  Clearing all raid content while allowing for an optimal WoW/Life balance. We would like to clear each tier of content well before the next tier comes available.
---
**What we expect of members:**
---
Raiding:  We are looking for raid members who will be lvl 60 within 6 weeks and 75% BiS within a total of 8-10 weeks after launch. We will accept casual players (friends/family) who are not progression minded. The player will not have a guaranteed raid spot but could be asked to fill in when required.
---
Social (strongly encouraged):  Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, etc.)
---
PVP: Our focus will be PVE content, but we encourage fun outside of Raid hours.
---
Be educated about the class you intend to main and how that class interacts with the raid. You must also be willing to continually learn and accept/give constructive criticism. We are willing to teach class mechanics and associated tactics and/or strategies but need people willing to put the time in and learn.
---
Be prepared to raid, bring your lunch pale and let’s get some work done!
---
**Our Raid Schedule:**  Mon &amp; Tues from 6:30 – 10:30pm PST. A third night may be added once additional raid content becomes available. 20-Man raid content will occur on off nights. Out of respect for member’s schedules, raid times will not be extended past raid end regardless of progression.
---
**Loot System:**  **Loot Council**

I also had a look through the code and saw a lot of BfA stuff. Then I realised that I do not really know enough about add-on development to be able to decide if it was legit or not. Thanks for checking it out for those of us who are well intentioned, but ultimately incompetent.
---
People are prob mad since the only reason the battle started at all is because there was a rivalry between two streamers
---
I'm gonna be disappointed if the only places that these battles occur are on big streamer servers with quadruple digit viewer streamers
---
&gt; Battle.net Client has no bugs, i want beta
---
Bug report :
---
My battle.net client is bugged. The World of Warcraft Classic Beta Test option is missing. Pls fix. Thx.
---
Alternatively, being forced to dismiss your pet every instance
---
$15 for access to 2 games and no purchase necessary is pretty damn cheap imo
---
Saw someone jump up on the wall in a clip recently, so they are not informed i guess...
---
You just need a copy of Cata
---
/s 
---
Very googleable
---
No lol
---
And there were a couple of other things that I really questioned as the battle played out.  First, I think it might have been wise if Asmon had had Esfand or some lieutenant assemble a group of 20 or so people who weren't streaming, and have them go kill the water elementals for the charms, while Asmon's army acted as a distraction.  Asmon didn't have to be there for the charms, and people were already trading him nearly every charm he ultimately received.  I don't know if it would actually have worked, but it sure seemed a lot smarter to me than all the time wasted, sitting around in Refuge Pointe, wishing more people would come to help.
---
Also, I don't really have much against Asmon or Esfand—this weekend was my first time watching streamers (and I enjoyed the Battle of Arathi Highlands very much!)—but Esfand performed, frankly, very weak leadership in this battle.  It didn't seem like he cared and didn't seem like he enjoyed Asmon's harsh attitude, but didn't have the guts to say anything about it, or really challenge Asmon on things.  He complained several times that he just wanted to go ding level 30.  He took about an hour to show up in Arathi.  Chat noted several times when he had allegedly eloped to Dun Morogh or Stormwind.  On one occasion, he said that he did it to respec to Holy since he felt that the healers weren't very good(???).  (Note that there were at least 8 Priests in Asmon's army.)
---
And Esfand allegedly his own raid of about 20 people, but few showed up on time (if at all).  When Asmon finally questioned him about their absence, Esfand said that they didn't have a Warlock in their raid, so he couldn't summon them.  Uhh, dude... you've been sitting around here for a good hour without your extra 15 or so people, because you need summons.  **How about you say something**, and get a Warlock transferred to your raid?  Sorry, this just looks to me like incompetent or careless leadership.
---
It's easy for me to complain.  I wasn't there, and no one is criticizing my actions.  But it sure didn't look to me like Esfand was even very interested in trying to contribute.
---
And one last correction: Sonii's video claims that it was "100 vs. 100".  No, it wasn't.  I don't know the numbers that the Horde had, but, at its height, Asmon had a full raid, and Esfand had a half a raid.  And most of Esfand's troops were not even there.  It was never more than 60 people on the Alliance side, probably not even 50.  I doubt the Horde side got above 75 people.
---
I like payo because the dwarf stole his ore,
---
this dude on the other hand looks like he's missin' his alcohol a little too much.
---
Horde players are just generally more active in PvP I've found, but I don't have data to back that up. Also depends on what server group you are in.
---
That is what I thought. I don't see it switching any time soon.
---
I don't know if tooltip is wrong or if there is the hidden .5 second 'ranged cast time'.
---
Like multishot should say instant, but it had a hidden .5 second cast time. Arcane shot is true instant instant.

These should cover it.
---
Beta does not carry over. That would be kind of unfair if it would.
---
&gt; What they're doing is continent and server based sharding, meaning that the shard boundaries are done by continent instead of dynamically calculated by the server, and there is no cross-realm going on. 
---
They specifically state you can travel between Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms on the Zeppelin and you're still on the same layer. It's also guaranteed to be gone by Phase 2 when the world bosses are added.
---
White Soap ?

So it bothers you somehow that strangers on the internet are discussing something that you don't want to discuss? K.

Autoshot timer and gatherer for me. I like to update my map with all those symbols that come from collecting nodes/herbs/chests.

---
I hope no-one makes light of this very serious comment.
---
why does this get asked so often
---
No. You never have and never will, in any game ever, be able to keep your beta character when the game goes live. No one would want to play if a select group of players got a 3 month headstart on everbody else.
---
[On the patch of "Melee Range"](http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/19398-tauren-swing-range-all/):
---
&gt;(the range on specials at one point was indicated on the abilities' tooltip, after a post on the warrior forums about this the tooltips were stripped of showing the actualy 'yard' range, and just indicate melee range now).
---
The post is dated 2008.05.03, which is patch 2.4.1. I guess confusion was indeed the cause for the change, although I can't find the mentioned forum post.
---
PvP has a serious learning curve, and you've really got to learn how to extort maximum/minimum ranges while kiting; but they can be super duper good against anything besides a warlock or paladin. Otherwise PvE they're pretty great with in general and have pretty excellent damage. You gotta keep your pet on Passive at all times and learn to use hotkeys to tell it when to attack or not. That's the most important thing. People get SUPER pissed in Raids if otherwise. That or just keep it dismissed until you're actually at the boss.
---
So to get the gear to be a good ele in pvp I have to also be a good reston in raids ?
---
I'll suck a dick to get Necrosis LdC updated.
---
I hate you !
---
he's not wrong. it just depends on the size of the server.
---
i'm personally gonna avoid Asmongold/Soddapoppin's server just because i know the queue times are going to be absolutely fucking ridiculous.
---
People seem to have this infatuation with needing to play a class that will fight to be #1 in all boss fights.
---
Hunters are legit in all aspects of the game, even PVE.
---
Farming, PVP, WPVP.
---
NA invites usually go out Monday through Friday from about 5pm Pacific time onward. This has been the pattern for the longest time as far as I know. I'd check again later tonight for NA.
---
I may be wrong but I thought I saw somewhere that you didn’t need an active sub to get invited to beta. Maybe that was someone on r/new trolling but I think you just have to have the classic beta box checked in your beta preferences on battle.net. Apologies if this is incorrect.
---
It should be the most obvious thing in the universe, yet it gets asked all the time.
---
Congrats fellow EU guys! I better sub or ill never a chance
---
Your biggest problem might be that too many people play hunter. It was difficult to find groups that didn't already have a Hunter, meaning you'd have to share your loot.
---
Could you explain what that means?
---
Wow is always 15$ always was. The fact that it now gets you classic amd retail is amazing
---
You're either going to pay $15 to play classic and get retail for free, or pay $15 to get retail and get classic for free. Take your pick and stop complaining.
---
I mean it was $15 back in the day too so....
---
EU 2005 players getting the love. Not so much NA side. Bummer. Hopefully next NA wave will include more of us mid-05'ers! :)
---
Hell I was 15 when I played in vanilla, I played thousands of hours - eventually dropped out of school to play more, like average 16 hour days on the game or staying up for 3 days straight raiding and playing. Even then, I still forget most of the specific details of vanilla and just have mainly "memorable moments" that I remember.
---
Dunno how anyone can say they have perfect memory of vanilla and try to argue to a point based on memory, unless they are just playing private servers and taking that as gospel and playing it off as "vanilla experience".
---
They have not
---
Gezet!
---
logging into the bnet client again and again and again and again seems to be working great on my end too. Only problem I saw is there isn't a Beta launcher in mine yet, I'll have to submit a bug report about that one... there is definitely supposed to be a Beta launcher in there...
---
I had similar feelings! Just remember that it is an exciting thing, don't let it stress you out. Go into with an open mind - maybe you'll play for a week, a month, 6 months, a year. Whatever ends up happening will happen. Give it a go and have fun, let the good times feel good :)
---
Lol well I prefer hello kitty island adventure than this dumb game.
---
First thing I'm going to test when able is hardware. Does anyone know if anyone is currently testing hardware?
---
I was surprised a MacBook air 2013 with an integrated hd 5000 can hold 60fps in a 1.12 client. Can it do the same in classic? Does classic require dx12 or will dx11 be ok? A lot of things I want to test and I have quite a few rigs and components to work with.
---
not this EU 2005 player :( day one also, unlucky
---
clean n cozy
---
So you define world PVP as having to be massive groups people charging at each other?
---
I remember 20v20s outside of TM/SS growing in bigger sizes and constant debauchery happening at Tyr's Hand.
---
Frostadamus is pretty chill, he doesnt act/create drama and he is pretty good at the game too.
---
Thing is, you could stop at 30 or any level and grind to the bis gear or meet for pvp, it's just not appealing, you're leveling so fast, blues are thrown at you everywere and world pvp doesn't happen in bigger scales.
---
 No. It was all in-game.
---
For the alliance!
---
Maybe we had some specialized shit - but I definitely remember seeing raid warning coming across while fighting chromaggus announcing vulnerabilities. I also remember them calling out Time Lapses once we determined what colors we had for the week.
---
Now maybe this was well planned out macros by the raid leadership at the time, but I could be wrong, it's been many many years since those days.
---
I do think that current bosses are designed with the abilities of DBM in mind and planned around - not to say its a 'required' addon, but things can be made trickier by assuming that people have them. Vanilla, while it certainly wasn't necessary, it existed and even in the most basic state where it was a glorified timer, was incredibly helpful. I'm not sure how modern dbm would 'break' classic encounters though, we still got spammed with tells when we got Essence of the Red or Living Bomb, I assume that won't change.
---
The only objective issues with hunters are the DPS dropoff in end game content, the limited raid availability, and losing a bag slot; that's it. The rest of the issues are subjective, like pet micro and deadzone. IMO those make the class interesting and unique and aren't necessarily straight downsides.
---
Think patch 1.12
---
Having that much before bc sure is a feat! I found soloing dm north tribute run to be quite broken in terms of gold farming.
---
How did you farm your gold?
---
Because the cost of classic would likely be the same as retail. Its been about $16 sense 2005 when I started playing. I don't think that would change, besides it gives them one nice big "concurrent subscriptions" number for their investor meetings. Probably better to hide it under the curtails of Retail Wow lest the investors want to try and soak more money out of it.
---
2005 EU account not in. i have another account on this [battle.net](https://battle.net) which is banned tho. don't know if that has anything to do with it.
---
I see that Kosken, figure you're not in beta either?
---
I mean, this whole image looks like someone at Blizzard that had never worked on WoW just got handed a database of game models and told to make a cool picture for the game package.
---
He was partially right, just his memory playing tricks on him.
---
You do realize that thanks to inflation, the game is now over 20% cheaper then back in the day because they kept their price? I'll never understand how people can "bitch" about 15$/€ per month for a game they'll play anywhere from 5-30 hours per week. That's the price for a single movie ticket, but you get a ton more time of entertainment.
---
Yeah it is fun to help people for sure :d
---
Wayback machine elitist jerks theorycrafting forums only goes to shortly after TBC release.
---
My memory was that tooltip said 3 second cast time, but it took 3.5 seconds.
---
Multishot tooltip should say instant, but it took .5 seconds.
---
Arcane shot was true instant and had no cast time.
---
If I add an adon to the list as "No info", will someone test if it works then?
---
Below or above the waist?
---
need to be 8 yards away from an enemy to use a ranged weapon on them. Good pvpers will abuse this against you... i.e. mages will stand at like 7 yards from you so you can neither shoot them nor melee them.... this is "the dead zone"
---
Thnx for info man. I got shit haha. Well good luck next time and have a nice time my friend.
---
THIS GUY IS A BIG FAT PHONY!
---
I am pretty sure this is sarcasm, but I really want to make a, "I hear Onyxia is using her Deep Breath a lot more, recently," comment =P
---
A 'fur blog' is something very different. Very different.
---
When an expansion pack makes all previous content completely avoidable it is effectively a stand alone game.
---
Thank you for the added information for others to read. I of course over exaggerated some parts for added tension (Like when i said the horde army was depleted) and like i said, i didn't watch the whole thing. Just felt like writing this from the clips I saw. Feel free to add as much extra as you want!
---
Soul shard addon. Easy to spend all of them in a long dungeon and having them up there reminded me if I needed to get more.
---
Yeah where you been man the Chinese are fuckin rich now
---
april 05 eu here, nada
---
No - in just about every game ever.
---
Now you know.
---
LET ME IN !
---
Reminds me of the story where a daycare started charging parents explicitly when they were late to pick up their kids, leading to more parents arriving late rather than fewer. The social contracts are much stronger and work on a different part of our reasoning skills than economic ones. Associating any tangible to something like Southshore/TM, no matter how small or big, fundamentally changes player engagement and enjoyment.
---
OW WA AH AH AH
---
Hey. Want to lvl together on a very active blizzlike pserver as warm up? Warrior/priest duo perhaps
---
Isn't that what reddit is for now. Why bother doing any research at all. 99% of the threads here  could be answered with a single Google or YouTube search but hey why do that when reddit will do it for the lazy shits.
---
It's funny seeing the same streamers who were talking shit about Classic playing the beta daily on their channels.
---
Im Mar 06. hopefully i'll get mine soon
---
No??? Are you joking?
---
It's who on this sub has been invited and is either on NA or EU. If you asked who hasn't been invited, that'd just include people on this sub that haven't been invited, on either EU or NA.
---
That would help nothing in terms of accuracy, because it's only this sub, and incredibly inaccurate when it comes to the whole of the metadata.
---
april 07 2005 here, not in.
---
How can you not see the difference?
---
Are you okay?
---
Same as the original WoW beta, no carry over (thankfully enough).
---
Wisp form is BiS for low level Wetlands runs :)
---
**&lt;The Tail** **End&gt; \[A\] \[US\] \[PvE\]**
---
A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me, or join Discord at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a)
---
Is that what 'deadzone' means?
---
Slightly different approach: Has this ever happened in any video game in history? I'm honestly curious.
---
Esfand can only improve!
---
Yes TM and SS because the honor system came out. We did it in plaguelands also. So what you are describing as world pvp is always happening in hellfire peninsula. People show up to gank and someone whines usually they are told to join a PvE server or someone comes and helps. Usually it ends in 4-4 fights or rogues stealthing and  still  killing low levels.
---

Herzlichen glückwunsch mein Freund :D
---
Date dont matter it seems. I have 2006 Account and not selected, but other with 2007 even got selected. So I think Age do not matter.  
---
Also it seems this time it is not a Rolling invite. So who ever is in, is lucky, others will have to wait a few days/weeks. EU Waves are very rare compared to NA. NA get a wave every day :X
---
Yeah every level feels like a powerspike even if you dont learn new abilities or get huge stat gains, because you can actually hit your spells on a mob. Especially in higher level zones.
---
Okey, and what does 'scaling' means?
---
thats not how it works buddy
---
I'm at work how can I check if I got in :(
---
Lets see that chest hair bud.
---
Congrats to everyone that got in. I'm sitting here (EU) mad jelly.
---
15 years of technology advancement that is also utilized in creating what these classes do! 
---
If you added Azerite Armor in to classic that might be enough to make it start lagging due to all the extra checks the servers would have to do per character
---
Glorious cluttered UI with 3 separate chat windows. One for chat, one for combat log, and one for whispers (I think).
---
It makes me so excited for Classic, even if it won't be as special this time around.
---
Pathetic, isn’t it?
---
**&lt;Ascendance&gt;,** ***casual/Semi-Hardcore Raid guild \[PvP\].***
---
**Region**: EU
---
**Server**: TBA, PvP
---
**Faction**: Alliance
---
**Raid schedule**: Tuesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 – 24:00 CEST
---
**Loot rules**: DKP
---
**About us:**
---
We are a group of vanilla veterans that have many years of experience raiding who are eager to return to the classic days. You can rest assured; we expect to farm Onyxia, Ragnaros and Nefarian yet again.
---
As the guild recruitment market is saturated with semi-hardcore and hardcore guilds. We aim to reach the more balanced segment, somewhere between casual and semi-hardcore. We do not expect any world first kills nor do we intend to reach the sky on damage parses. We do however take our raiding seriously and do not intend to accept continuous wipe nights due to someone not committed to studying the tactics required. As such, we are looking for people who are passionate and willing to help securing the guilds success.
---
In addition, some of our members have a lot of PvP experience both from vanilla and in later expansions, achieving high PvP ranks and 2200 arena ratings. This also means that, apart from raiding, most will also have a healthy interest in PvP and as such, if you have an interest, you will find plenty of guildies to share it with.
---
Should your interest purely be social or completely PvP related, you are welcome as well.
---
**What we expect**:
---
* You to play your class well and have knowledge of the various boss / trash mechanics.
---
* High raid attendance.
---
* Be on time for raids (at raid location at/before scheduled time) \[DKP on time bonus\]
---
* Positive outlook and a friendly behavior towards your fellow guildie.
---
**What we do not expect**:
---
* We do not expect our members to spend exuberant amount of hours on world buffs or consumables before every raid, but we do expect people to be prepared with what would be considered reasonable. (e.g. Healing Potions, Mana Potions, fire protection potions, bandages, soul shards, Symbols of divinity, arrows etc.).
---
* That you play the perfect raid spec down to the last point. This means that we do not expect SM Ruin warlocks to respec if there is not enough debuff slots for corruption. We do not expect every hunter to have true shot aura if your PvP activities require you to have scatter/intim. We do, however, not allow specs that break the debuff limit. This means we do not allow warriors to have deep wounds for example. (For a more case-to-case example, ask an officer or GM)
---
**What our progression roadmap looks like**:
---
* Leveling (Launch + 4 – 6 weeks)
---
* Attunements (Week 6-7)
---
* Onyxia &amp; Molten Core (Week 8)
---
* ZG, BWL, AQ, Naxx (TBD)
---
We are well aware, that we are ambitious when it comes to the roadmap. We do however think it’s important to clarify what our dream scenario is. Naturally, we need a certain amount of people before we can start raiding and as there are some uncertainties when it comes to experience gain, the roadmap might be subject to change/postpone. We will however start raiding as soon as member count allows it.
---
**You can find us at** [https://discord.gg/X3eXFue](https://discord.gg/X3eXFue)
---
Be aware that most content in our Discord is hidden for non-members. If you want to reach out to us, or just chat you are very welcome to drop by.
---
Seems date do not matter. Some 2006/2007 got in. I have 4x 2006 Accounts active and none got picked.
---
Sadly, hunters and priests were the only classes that had an "epic class chain" and i didnt play either of those classes in vanilla.
---
But yea, i remember Rhok'delar and Lok'Delar as well.
---
So would that mean the game would be less taxing on my toaster and have less fps drops
---
exactly and like theloras said earlier it was tied to Seal of blood change. also like i said earlier reckoning is an unintended mechanic where you could stack unlimited charges and unleash it all at once like a bomb. of course if your a goober you will argue that it was always intended but just with the 4 charges they later added. but kevin jordan even stated that it was meant to be used as a get crit, and you hit back right away and nothing to do with storing charges. but this mechanic was left in the game by blizzard but put with charges. when bc came out it was heavily changed and you can no longer store charges and unleash a reckoining bomb. shall we remove this feature? heck no. should we remove powershifting and the gnomer mace being bis for feral druids at end game for both dps and tanks. theres a million things that the developers didnt go ok we are going to make it exactly like this and then they accidently made something else. that doesnt mean its a bug. its clever use of game mechanics. oh yeah and even if you remove sor being able to proc effects, seal of the crusader is complete balls.
---
so seal of righteous can proc effects and to me theres nothing that seems obviously unintended about it. yes sor does not have a weapon swing or can crit. but the seal system is a replacement for paladins getting crusader and holy strike removed in beta version of the game. so the seal despite not having its own melee swing and melee modifier and melee crit can proc things. it cant even crit at all while almost all other spells can. so its not just a normal "spell" its a seal that is a replacement for melee abilities. so im not to suprised it can proc effects
---
again even if you think this is a bug you will have to do the same for every other ability in the game that has unintended effects. ive already mentioned a few but i could go on and on. ill name a few more. whirlwind getting a 3.0 cd in tbc. oh but thats because of duel wielding? yes of course and the same can be said with the sor change and seal of blood when the mechanic got changed in tbc. how about paladins crusader stike not being able to proc seals in tbc? that seems odd its a melee strike.. of course in wrath it can proc seals because its a new expansion and things are changed. but i guess if we get a tbc server we can say oh look at this bug let crusader strike proc seals. actually on the topic of power shifting from earlier kevin jordan was talking about it and saying it was cool that you could do it but he said if blizzard was going to officialy support it then they would have to balance the game around it, and thus it was removed and not kept as a mechanic. but its not a bug still, despite furor+wolfshead helm being used as shifting out and in with a macro instantly. its just clever use of mechanics
---
It's really not that much money, most people who are targeted by this release are adults and are going to be able to afford so reducing the sub will almost certainly lose them money
---
It's not about the gear, it's how well you play your class.
---
I had mediocre gear, not enough fire resist to finish MC and simply a Nemesis Skullcap and a few pieces of felheart and yet, I was able to defeat fully decked tier 2 warriors and rogues bc of both my spec (demo/afflic) and the knowledge of how to defeat my enemy.
---
And to add to my anecdote, I did one ever run of SSC bc I was begged to tag along. Went in, was mocked for my gear being more pvp than pve and told I'd be useless. Yeah, when the raid pulled a pat, the last ppl standing were me and the tank that I had the presence of mind to ss right before he died. I made sure to /violin my entire raid.
---
It's not the gear you wear, its how you play the game. Real skill trumps loot any day of the week
---
I don't think the date matters. There will be bigger waves sent out before the stress test.
---
Who would have guessed that /b/ can’t afford the subscription fee?
---
I was in the original open beta and subbed since day 1. (Only subbed about 1/2 the 14.5 years) no luck yet, but I only resubbed a couple days ago
---
My account was created 4 months after vanilla was released and I'm subbed and I haven't got an invite. I've heard of people who created their account during tbc and wotlk and got in.
---
Can you explain this? I definitely remember seeing a item of the x dropping in vanilla.
---
Well it is but usually just people killing in front of raids but people have a schedule so they do a little killing and run in for raid.  It will be mostly two groups of fives trying to farm but being interrupted constantly.
---
naw. Dwarf Priest is probably the only racial that "matters", but even then, it just allows your tank to be lazy. it's not necessary.
---
Same here, honestly I think almost the majority of people was thinking that the first time they saw it.
---
All those things are possible in Classic with right addons
---
Upvoted. I need more Hobbit in my life.
---
Assuming they won't raise the cap for additional testing is asinine.
---
Did you get an E-mail confirmation or did it just pop up on your launcher?
---
&lt;**Booty Bay Beach Boys**\&gt; **NA-PVP, Horde**
---
**About Us:** We are a group of friends that have been playing together off and on since wrath. We have a relaxed, social atmosphere that enjoys PvP and have dived into PvE content throughout the game’s lifespan. Without any public recruitment, we have acquired 10 members that I personally know. We are all located in The U.S. ranging from Hawaii to Florida, but mainly play around the Central/Mountain time zone. Most of us are in our early to mid-20’s, but definitely welcome all ages.
---
**What are we looking for?:** We are looking for all classes that are interested in a social guild that enjoys world pvp and casual raiding. We are also in need of vanilla veterans that are willing to be raid leaders! If you are an experienced raider it would be greatly appreciated to help raid lead us!
---
**Goals:** One big goal is to have a positive social environment in the guild. We want to have a fun and enjoyable atmosphere that all members can be apart of. Another goal is to create epic world pvp! Our group has enjoy pvp throughout every xpac and expect it in classic. Last but not least, we expect to progress through all the classic raid content. We do not expect to be world first, though we do want to experience all the PvE that classic has to offer.
---
**How to apply:** Contact me on discord @Hayden#1101
---
Probably a caster/melee DPS hybrid that pays the hybrid tax for no apparent reason and therefore is useless for anything other than Firebrand AoE in full caster gear. 
---
Basically power/dps increases over time... i.e. other classes will get stronger as the game goes on and new gear from new raids is released.   
---
I wouldn't let any of this discourage you if you want to roll a hunter though. They have really good "outplay" potential against a lot of classes in pvp. and they are one of the highest skill ceiling classes in vanilla so you can always improve on your mechanics and rotation.... sure a mage will prob out dps you in MC but they will just be pressing frostbolt, which can be kind of mind numbing.
---
Requires lvl 32...
---
Wait, Classic is mainstream now? Well fuck Classic then, it ruined Warcraft 3.
---
Wow you kids be angry all da time. Anyone need a VC carry?
---
We watching the same video? I see asmongolds face in every one.
---
Are they fighting a red dragon in Zul'Gurub?
---
It's because it's basically twinking. At any level cap you have: 
---
1. Endgame quests for awesome gear (Ex. Whirlwind Axe)
---
2. Dungeons to run for character gear progression.
---
3. Professions to level
---
4. Professions specifically for character gear progression.
---
They only thing level 30 is missing is raiding content and BGs. The game is pretty much the same regardless of level cap and it's fun!
---
Looks like it's sold out as of 12:08pm (PST). Only see $50
---
Payo is bad tho
---
I have literally no idea what you're trying to say.   You don't level incredibly fast, unless you're putting in insane hours.  You aren't thrown blues, you have to earn those.   You level in mostly greens.  World PvP happens where you make it happen.
---
*heavy breathing*

Is not "the EU" beta.   It's just beta.   Just fyi.
---
lost it at the NPC face.
---
These make me so happy!
---
Not that I have ever seen. The people that say it has usually seem to confuse beta with early log in from pre-ordering.
---
and like theloras said earlier it was tied to Seal of blood change. also like i said earlier reckoning is an unintended mechanic where you could stack unlimited charges and unleash it all at once like a bomb. of course if your a goober you will argue that it was always intended but just with the 4 charges they later added. but kevin jordan even stated that it was meant to be used as a get crit, and you hit back right away and nothing to do with storing charges. but this mechanic was left in the game by blizzard but put with charges. when bc came out it was heavily changed and you can no longer store charges and unleash a reckoining bomb. shall we remove this feature? heck no. should we remove powershifting and the gnomer mace being bis for feral druids at end game for both dps and tanks. theres a million things that the developers didnt go ok we are going to make it exactly like this and then they accidently made something else. that doesnt mean its a bug. its clever use of game mechanics. oh yeah and even if you remove sor being able to proc effects, seal of the crusader is complete balls.
---
I have read it, my major point is, Blizz doesnt need to do anything. The reason this was fun is because it was organic. Blizz enforcing things is what got them in the mess that retail is in. The things you are asking for will happen, but just at level 60
---
Wrong lol
---
Hi, /u/glockinmyprius
---
I can't believe how often this silly question is asked.
---
I can't wait to join a world where I am recognized for my ability/commitment to the game and not by how much I spent on a character boost.  I don't care if I only make it to level 30 in four years, it will be an earned level 30.
---
I mean technically I played since 2004... On my older brothers account. Got all the way to level 22 as a tauren hunter!
---
Because generally the people interested in this are actually fucking retarded
---
Herbalism is very good on a rogue. For a couple of reasons.
---
1) you can do rfd stealth runs where you can both pickpocket mobs and pick all the grave moss in the instance. Grave moss nets you a lot of good money.
---
This was a really good gold making method on pservers as the grave moss would always spawn on the same location, making it easy for you to memorize a route and manage your cooldowns etc.
---
With doing pickpocket, picking grave moss and killing almost all bosses for their loot you could make a really solid amount of money on a rogue. And there are two chests that would ocasionally give you some nice blue boe’s.
---
2) you can camp lotus spawns in stealth. This can be done on a druid as well, but in addition to rfd farming, you can also do this which is really nice if you want change.
---
He means today, right?  Not like *all time*... guys?
---
The data are available as subreddit stats we can access as a moderator.
---
Oh sorry, thought I've written "on retail". I wanted to state, that many things are technically still possible and could be done on retail servers, put the game doesn't make it appealing in any way.
---
&lt;Man Up&gt; [NA] [PvP]
---
Classic Discord: https://discord.gg/5xaMZqk
---
Same Man Up from Tera/BDO. Going back for some nostalgia, late night raiding and PvP. We want to slay some dragons in caves and virgins in WSG. Come to play and laugh.
---
Recruitement is 100% open all classes until shortly after launch when we find out who wants to level and raid and premade pvp.
---
Anyone interested tell your friends, we want bodies for launch day. All are welcome to join pre launch.
---
Raid times/faction/server to be determined closer to launch day.
---
Feel free to hop in discord and ask questions.
---
I still remember the tinnitus sound my CRT did when it got angry or had to show 60Hz. And can't forget the wobbling screen, shrugs
---
Stay away fom' da voo'doo
---
It is but retail has the same thing
---
NA 2006. :(
---
Hmm, I wonder why that works...
---
You can't get quest items except for the 2 rogue quests that require you to pickpocket to complete them. 30+ is when pickpocketing is nice. You get poison and blind/vanish reagents, lockboxes to level lockpicking, and a decent chunk of change.
---
Aye. Luckily i got vodka ;) have 5 weeks off work 1 week after release tho. So i can wait :)
---
&gt; Is mob damage correct or not?
---
it is. Berserker Stance makes him take 10% more, which means he's taking 20% more damage since Battle Stance would be neutral and Defensive would be -10%.
---
Level 30 twinks.
---
For me it was always about a battle against people from the other faction
---
Be it now in an organized Open World Standoff,raiding their cities or if someone that gets ganked calls everyone over - Even in BGs it didn't matter where.  
---
People knew each other by Character Name even if their skilllevel wasn't even close to each other.  
---
Oh there he is,Rank 13 Bob the Mage and friends....We meet again and this time we will win!
---
It was about competition and some pride and the ability to claim "Haha we won" and people talked about that for days.
---
The same with dungeons.
---
You remember the names from the people you did those Dungeons with especially for the first time and if they were random people.
---
The people you met through questing or asking for directions.  
---
Today?
---
\*klick\* WTF 20 Seconds waiting for Dungeons Invite?OMG!"  
---
Who the heck are these people?Oh Epics...oh legendary niiiiiiice rush rush rush  
---
Maybe the Quality of Life Design is worse in Classic in some points but all those interaction like you are actually playing a MMORPG is untouchable and Blizzard threw that away to satisfy the loot hungry crybabies.
---
There is a reason that most people that have to say negative things about Classic are mostly also those that at least once said somewhere " I hated this grouping up stuff to get somewhere with my character"
---
Then play your shit Singleplayer Skyrim Game and be the Hero there.
---
 &gt;Blizz enforcing things
---
Of course they don't have to do anything, never said they did and never said it wasn't fun because it's organic. I'm suggesting a different kind of fun again that we got to experience with the beta being level capped.
---
Okay, so you didn't comprehend the post.
---
I'm asking for completely separate realms that do not change the base game at all and have their own rules on a timer.
---
I want these things to be able to happen at different levels and with different rules.
---
I'm not looking for a fantastic experience, just a consistent 30 fps while raiding while not stuck on the lowest possible graphics. I have no technological prowess or knowledge, what would be a good laptop to look into for this?
---
Not a retail shill but vanilla had lots of objectively bad game design, like debuff limits and spell batching. Perhaps these were due to technical constraints but I definitely wouldn’t say 1.12 was WOW at its best.
---
Vanilla was run on dedicated blade servers. 
---
Today's servers are a couple of magnitudes stronger, and everything being cloud there is no reason to have a 2500 cap hard coded.
---
"My class sucks. The class that counters me is overpowered. If I'm talking about PVP, ignore my class' dominance in PVE. If I'm talking about PVE, ignore my class' dominance in PVP. I have invested far too much time to be bested by other classes. I have no experience balancing but blizzard should listen to me and treat my opinions as fact." - Every class forum post.  
---
Even the rogues complained, and they're straight up busted.
---
If you can't have $18 dollars worth of fun every month you play Classic, then I have to ask... how excited _are_ you and your other friends?
---
No shit, "doesn't have Berserker Rage yet"
---
Ez
---
"Most legitimate" probably isn't much in Classic.
---
I don't don't if I'd say very similar, there's a lot more solo effort in 14 and it's only decided by the players going for it. But sure
---
Core Marksman Rifle was my jaaaaaaam!
---
It's not a shittier version &gt;:(
---
AWH HERE COMES THE PAIN, BITCH!
---
The whole aspect of World PVP changes without flying mounts. Especially in the original Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdom zones.
---
It is not the same thing and never will be.
---
This is great work.
---
Pro:  Every piece of gear is hunter gear.  This goes doubly for weapons.
---
It's fun seeing the pvp battles, but I'm not resubbing just for a shot at the beta. I don't want to put any time into a character that um not going to be able to keep. I want to go 1 to 60 by myself and do it when the game releases.
---
I don't think Every Man was in vanilla.
---
positives: good at pvp, very good at pve, they're fun to play imo
---
negatives: need to be skillful at not getting your deadzone exploited, not very good at raid dps, pets are not used in raids. 1 hunter is good for a raid but only having 1 makes it difficult for hunters to find a raid guild. that's not to say you won't find one, but people who raid leaders who want to min-max raid comps will at most put in 1 hunter. arrows also add up to a decent cost over time
---
Personal rivalries fueled WPvP even during Vanilla. Ganking a rival guild’s GM or prominent PvPers was always a highlight.
---
I think the official realm forums really helped with this, too. Hopefully those come back in some way, or if not we get a similar community through Discord/Reddit
---
They actually thought about adding Demon Hunter as a class in TBC, but decided they were not ready at that point. I'm not sure if they ever planned it for vanilla (aside from probably mentioning it for a brainstorm or something, they can't *not* have considering they most likely looked at all the WC3 heroes when making classes).
---
Something interesting is that originally much of TBC was supposed to be part of vanilla, but it started to become so big they decided to make it into an xpac. We don't know exactly when in the process of TBC they thought about the Demon Hunter, but considering it seems to have been decided against early on it might have been planned for the "vanilla TBC".
---
Great read and I bet this was great for beta testing their server stability as well. :)
---
dude me too, I remember browsing pwndepot and shit back in the day, it was cash. My 39 pally on Silvermoon was the BOMB
---
Are u subbed in BFA?
---
And we’ve also seen a few people say they got an invite without and active sub, but they did need to sub to play.
---
Try playing a raid healer at 800x600 - it's that, but add 40 health bars.
---
Sept 06. No beta yet. x(
---
Well on lights hope alliance has more people, that’s the biggest pserver I know of... not sure about Kronos
---
It would actually be kinda neat to see servers cap levels every week at the 10s. Just to see what folks come up with for specs, gearing, etc. Every zone would be madness while leveling.
---
OK so this is BIG news if true cause everyone thinks you had to be subbed before beta before having a chance to get in.
---
Why do people keep asking this? In every MMORPG Beta ever or beta's in general you never could keep anything and transfer into full release.
---
I remember \*trying\* to use it for the group quests in Icecrown, to no success. Ya, no one used it. And ya I think I remember it being a thing in TBC now, but again it was a ghost-town feature. Sort of like the LFG chat channel we had forever, but everyone used Trade chat instead, lol. 
---
It's all a bit of a mess now, lots of "Looking for" options and tiers of content. There's now, LFD (Looking for Dungeon queues), LFR, LFG (the old interface brought back with cross server in-mind) and the levels of content people look for through that (Flex raiding). I was cobbling together what people were talking about when I started playing semi-regularly again during WoD, then again when I quit that and came back for Legion.
---
As long as your account is listed as active you could potentially be invited for the beta. Thats all the matters
---
Cracked up at the charging hordes of twitch chat and Mcool reeeing, good shit
---
you insist on being rude i am done talking. I have read and understood your post. I am commenting on key aspects of the post
---
regardless of how you feel such a server would not do well, nor be in demand. Blizz doesnt even know if they will have an RPPVP server right now
---
cringe
---
Allowing players to keep their progress made before launch makes it early access IMO. Bethesda called their early access plan for Fallout 76 a B.E.T.A last year. Though their 'beta' only started around 3-4 weeks before release and was up for only very limited hours each time. I think we all know how that went.
---
💪😎 "Champ Shit Only" #snapintuit Snapjitsu™ 🏆
---
i forgot the channel but there was one who was actually not that horrible compared to all the other crap, ill look it up later when im home.
---
It's either a sub OR game time. Both are not required at once.
---
Been doing several times a day for the last week.  Still bugged, no beta - please fix.
---
I will imagine at some point they'll raise it to at least 40 so they can properly test mounts and all those interactions. Whether they wipe characters first or not.
---
pix or it didn't happen!
---
ur right. it was perception which let them see through stealth at greater distance.
---
EU here, never canceled my sub since 2007 and no invite. HF
---
Have you looked at the stats page of the most popular pservers. I would list the names but it’s not allowed. They show alliance having more people.
---
Oh yes, if you're talking retail you're 100% correct, except you dont get blues thrown at you... because you're in full heirlooms and you vendor the blues.
---
Dorf &gt; all.
---
I roll dorf warrior.
---
All dorfs should join my guild so we can take over a server. Nobody can resist our mighty pre-nerfnerfnerfnerfnerfnerfnerf Stoneform!
---
Like Enh shamans, but with leather armor?
---
Same here... 17th of feb 2006 I started my sub.
---
Cons? Ammo and pet food can add up over time, making hunters a little more expensive to play than other classes in the long run. Pets can be a massive pain in the ass in dungeons, but that isn't so bad as long as you keep an eye on them and dismiss them before jumping off cliffs.
---
I have always heard of hunters as a "easy to play, hard to master" kind of class and that sounds right to me. Great hunters always stand out among the rest.
---
War stomp is sick in pvp!
---
  To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account

1% dodge is alright, but the weapon skill is objectively better
---
That said, play whatever you want. Its not like you won't be able to tank raids as a NE.
---
Timthetatman will definitely stream it. Faux ( 1k+ viewer runescape streamer) said he’ll definitely stream it. OP apparently doesn’t think 1k viewer streamers are big enough to make an impact lmao.

this is the guy that got fired from blizzard right

Create Your Character
---
If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.** Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!&gt;
---
Yawn more top viewer streamers accepting items, whining, begging, and not even playing the game the way its intended to. Literal leeches.
---
How am I being rude? You have clearly chosen to ignore key elements of the post. You are actively wasting both our time by being obtuse.
---
You are not commenting on the post, you are commenting on your own idealization and narrative of blizzards operations.
---
Again on your last point, this is a suggestion, stifling discussion because of what you think Blizzard can and can't do isn't productive.
---
The point of this discussion is if this idea could work or be sustainable.
---
Well... It only released in 2005 in EU, so... Yes, I lied about it, but if you rephrase that to "played from release", i'm not lying ;).
---
Good times for sure bro I feel you
---
well they let you reserve your name before the launch so i'd imagine there will be a realm selection list. i'm interested to find out which servers are hosted on west coast, cent, east coast etc.. even the way they do it now, you can't base it off the time zone of the server, because some servers will show a west coast time zone but the datacenter is actually located on the east coast and vice versa
---
Don't expect to hit max level in a week - it'll take between 90 and 150 hours depending on how efficient you are - it's a grind, yes, but leveling is half of the game!
---
The devs that are the public face of certain projects take the hit when the game is bad, so I guess it's only fair they also get the praise when stuff goes well
---
The people that say don't worry its just a beta are the same idiots that preorder broken games over and over again. It's 2019 and game developers now have the reputation of pushing crappy products. If they don't like that reputation start fixing bugs reported in the betas and stop selling preorders.
---
&gt;Ally: Human detect Stealth is VERY strong
---
no it isn't, it's worthless against other rogues that know how to play
---
Those are other channels uploading react videos of him. There’s tons for load of other streamers. Anyone can upload portions of others’ streams and make money off that.
---
Have you considered watching the video on how to get to Stormwind FROM Darnassus, but just watch it backwards instead?
---
I had a 1600x1200 20" CRT.
---
Absolutely loved it.
---
This just got me thinking. Tauren can be hunter in vanilla cant they? They have a 7 yard melee range which should technically reduce the deadzone to 1 yard at least what auto attacks are concerned right?
---
They say if you cut off a certain extremity, it'll grow back bigger, don't believe it mon.
---
Get me beta and I'll do rais. Can't really do it in BFA because auto shot doesn't work the same way :(
---
Until you get a epic mount with that and water walking nobody ever caught us.
---
If it was implemented in vanilla then it would be an alliance only class because no belfs yet
---
Good to know. I started playing as soon as I got invite and haven't read up on whats going on. Did they announce somewhere it was capped at 30? Is there a roadmap? I just checked my email and it was a link to the beta forums but none of the stickied posts mentioned anything.
---
Both
---
Yea I did because they were running dungeons and I wanted to wont run with him again because he’ll do stuff like randomly turn master looter on and not roll for chests
---
Sure, if you frequently agree with young teens.
---
much appreciated
---
Is there any chance at all for someone that has a account from Mist to get in? I think im out of luck on this one
---
This is making me fear that classic will be one per battlenet :(
---
Sure there is, the game is designed around it. I'm sure they could stuff many more people into a server, but it would not be vanilla. What we want is a faithful recreation right? If you stuff more people than the game is designed for into the servers you ruin the game, the community, and the economy.
---
Precisely, while tauren are considered to be one of the less optimal choices for hunter... warstomp is op
---
would have an evasion tank theme that would be utterly useless.  aoe farm meme with immolation.  maybe similar to prot paladin vanilla -&gt; tbc with aoe tanking niche
---
How is that data beneficial, at all? Is the purpose of the survey to find out if blizz is giving more invites to EU players vs. US players? Find out if there are more EU or US players on this subreddit? What?
---
For any kind of useful comparison I can think of, you need to have the number of people who didn't get in for comparison. Then, if we see that 9 US players to every 1 EU player got in, but there were 10x as many US people filling out the survey, we can assume it's relative to the population. With the options OP listed, we can't do that, at all.
---
Like seriously, what's the point of this survey as it stands now. What useful info can you even try to pull from this.
---
I asked her and I was mistaken, it's an 2005 eu release account. She got it her self around cata, but before that she shared it with her mother since release.
---
What? Do you have an issue with his false bug reports and his toxic attitude of reporting players with the non-vanilla function to screw them over only to cry about the same function that he used himself?
---
[There's absolutely no way that he would do something like that](https://streamable.com/4vtik) [Only to cry about it at one point or another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SbjASLwA34&amp;t=3s)
---
Besides, his "Charming" personality surely should have won you over at one point or another.
---
world pvp occurred before blizz even put any rewards for killing players in the game. it was always a thing. it's not just a thing in wow it's a thing in online games in general. people will always want to kill each other even if there's no tangible benefit to do so. it's an internet rule pretty much
---
Has anyone got it that isn’t currently subscribed?
---
Imagine having such a problem with other peoples personal opinions.
---
Yes they are the best, but they also dominate a server and its economy so hard without any regard for anyone else, they squeeze everyone else out. Great players, but also a bunch of egomanial narcisissts.
---
It does not rain every day anywhere.
---
I get off work at 6:30 CST, I'm not going to sit and do nothing but stare at my wow launcher for an hour and a half with heavy breathing and anxious sweats to see IF they do it! Thank you for the anticipation anxiety :P
---
Man, these graphic updates are wild!
---
Thanks for the post, no email but checked account and I'm in. Day 1 account played every expansion and have been dubbed since BFA launch.  
---
My wife did not get in however, her account is pretty much same as mine but started 6 weeks after launch.
---
That's what PVE servers are for.
---
Is it weird that i never gave a shit about twitch and streamers?
---
See comrades? There will be plenty of chum in the waters!
---
I mean for the first month it probably will be true because lots of non-WoW streamers are going to spread out and flood the game, but a lot of them will get bored and move on after a few weeks after giving it a try, and the ones that stick around will quit after they clear MC/Ony and realize they have to wait like 6 months into the game for any content.
---
I love it so much. I don't have to be a raider in vanilla. I bet I can be an MC pug while I sell useful stuff to the hardcore people. And just have fun with RP, PvP, exploration, and literally anything else.
---
This is so great!
---
As well as different special ability.
---
If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.** Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!
---
It Just popped up. No Email.
---
I brought this up mostly with the intent to address the elephant in the room.  There was no twitch/influencer phenomenon in Classic WoW.  It was this guild or that guild, and it was server specific.  Streamers have these massive followings of people that will sweep across content like a plague of locusts.  Look at some of the "ALL THE THINGS" addon support that big streamers get from their following.  There's no way anyone on a server with a reasonably large streamer fanbase is going to compete for iconic feats of strength such as the Scarab Lord.
---
That said, I thought it would be great to have cross faction rivalries between big streams.  This sort of thing works out well on other platforms, and gives fans things to be hyped for.  A sort of friendly competition.
---
I didn't realize this would be such an unpopular opinion.  The downvotes are real.
---
That's why layering exists. You only see your layer, and that's why they plan to merge layers together. The server itself won't have a 2500 software cap just because. Especially because they are using the modern client/server, not the old one.
---
same deal as me, I checked if I had it because of this thread.. and now I'm downloading it :)
---
2x December 2004, not in yet on either :'(
---
Unrelated because he didn't ask, but I personally love the feral druid and make leveling combo. Druid is great at gathering things up and tanking them, mage aoes them down, druid can innervate the mage and throw hots. Felt pretty great.
---
Well that’s cool he’s a nice guy nailed me every mama pot he found is always down to tank dungeons hopped in discord for groups if he is a big deal he definitely doesn’t act like it
---
I haven't played WoW in 9 years. Got my old account back this weekend, played a bit and couldn't be more excited for Vanilla. My wife on the other hand is not.
---
Well you can add King Gothalian to the big streamer list. I didn't know until this morning he had any interest in classic. And he had 4k watching his beta stream.
---
I think it's better if you just turn off growl and turn your pet onto passive, only dismiss when you group is going to do some platforming/trying to avoid certain pull strategies. I think pet control is one of the most important signs of a good hunter.
---
That's why I'll play on one, and why I (personally) like BGs.
---
3% spell crit aura is no meme!
---
That's redundant.
---
When I was a kid I always thought the dwarf was shooting big fire bullets. Oh the disappointment.
---
There is no cow level.
---
Kind of, except without the redeeming factor of totems or heals. 
---
Instead, he'd have a unique melee ability that allows him to spin and thus instantly turn his facing by 180°. 
---
It would get removed in BC and the forums would still debate about the purpose of this ability.
---
I was talking about duels. Also in bg’s it can be very useful against druids and rogues. The range was surprisingly high.
---
Anyone else finding it hard to wait to absolutely shit on these streamers and their egos? I know not everyone can be 2500+ arena rated pvpers but god damn, if you were rated 2000+ at least you would dunk on these kiddos in world pvp in a semi-fair match.
---
Except Gnomer.  Gnomer is the one place you should never dismiss your pet.
---
World PVP is definitely a thing in Classic. People will be fighting everywhere
---
Played Vanilla Beta ¦ Account since Feb 2005 \\  sub active since .... without a stop ! Beta ?? no... sad ... of course
---
&gt; I can’t explain why  
---
I see it like this: Warfronts are like playing a level in WC3, except you're playing a peon for the majority of it.
---
Who doesn't love some good old 4:3
---
Oh that’s cool he’s a really cool guy, he mailed me every mama potion he got, is always down to tank dungeons, gets on discord for pvp. If he is a big deal he definitely doesn’t act like it
---
Correct, my account was from 3 days after the launch in 2004, and I am not in. Its pretty much RNG
---
so you're advocating for a racial because it can duel 2 classes more efficiently?
---
Thank you that’s all I wanted to know.
---
Me too! :D - also EU.
---
&gt; We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!
---
Interesting...
---
Yeah, if it were 3% hit from 10 weapon skill, human rogues wouldn't have needed any +hit from gear to reach the yellow cap. I played horde, but according to the old forums, this wasn't the case. They needed the 3% from gear too.
---
I personally don't ever plan on using swords once I hit 60 and obtain some decent daggers. It'll be a little while since there are so few good pre-raid daggers until DM and BGs launch, but once I go Combat Daggers, I'll only switch to Seal Fate for AQ, never going swords again. It's not my playstyle and I don't like competing with Fury Warriors for weapons.
---
OMG, me too. When I was reading this Post I was already prepared for disappointment.
---
Omfg, all these people getting beta key and yet im unlucky again. Gz to everyone though
---
Sorry to bother you, any chance so far?
---
No, you are wrong.
---
Explains why you were all rolling on spelldamage gear.
---
We need a blue response for this bug. This bug existed in the game many years ago and was fixed. The same bug may have been reintroduced in the Legion client and a fix may already exist. No one trusts betas anymore now in 2019 when game developers constantly push broken games after a gloried beta.
---
no longer $40
---
2004, active sub, no invites
---
What region are you in? If it is friends to level with you are after, this seems like a good place to find them. Have you checked out the [LFG Mondays sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqtcvo/looking_for_group_monday_may_20_2019/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)? There may be a guild recruiting there that takes your interest with discord that is already active.
---
Well it’s not like I can advocate it for arena now can I? Wanna have an advantage over rogues and duels? There you go. Idk about you but a lot of my time in vanilla was spent in duels.
---
I doubt there will be any streamers on whatever server I choose to play.  I play on RP servers exclusively.  If there's no RP-PVP then I'll just do RP.  While I like PVP, I like RP/PVE more as the players on RP servers have always been older, more casual, and more helpful players which meshes with my style of play.

There is no expertise in Vanilla...

If you like looking retarded it's perfect

The only ones I see normally are twitch thot streams.

Dungeons aren't really that great of content compared to retail so no need for the idiot filter that is raider io.  There will be add-ons for elitism so if you think that's gone people got another thing coming to them.
---
I'd recommend SSD and an i5 or i7 from 2017 or newer with graphics card like a 1050 or better. In my country you can get a new MSI or Acer Nitro with these specs for around €700 and refurbished for around €550. A system like this will last for another 15 years of WoW :)
---
AV is why I'll be playing Classic.  I know it's the shit version, but it's still the main reason why I'm going back.
---
At this point it should be considered gambling to buy a WoW subscription just for the hope of getting into the beta. But damn, I'm an impulsive man.
---
Woo, got in!
---
Sub since day 1 of retail vanilla, was actually in EU Beta and US Alpha due to some connections. Unsubbed at the end of Mists of Pandaria, never played anything past that so dodged the bullet that was WoD.
---
Resubbed to WoW last week purely for the hope of the beta.
---
 Hello everyone,  
---
**\[EU-PvE\]&lt;No Fun Allowed&gt;\[Alliance\]** is recruiting for Classic World of Warcraft and looking for exceptional players from any class or role!

**About Us:** No Fun Allowed is a newly formed semi-hardcore raiding guild. It's core consists of other former hardcore/semi-hardcore guild members which have achieved many realm first kills. We raid 3 days per week and aim to clear all bosses in an efficient manner.
---
**Goal:** Our main goal is to achieve top 20 realm in terms of raid progression with fewer hours than most high end guilds. We plan to achieve this by researching tactics before raiding and helping each other with their class as well as giving constructive feedback. Strats will be posted on the forums well before every fight and we require each player to not only understand but contribute and find every other piece of information available to them to be prepared for the fight.
---
\-You want to progress fast with fewer hours than most high end guilds.  
---
\-You enjoy putting in hours outside of raid learning fights and watching videos.  
---
\-You want to enjoy the people you raid with.  
---
\-You want to play with players who put in high effort.  
---
\-You understand that your dps/hps output matters less than mechanical skill &amp; consistency.  
---
\-You are motivated to actively improve your play.  
---
\-You are 21 or more years old.

I dont understand, why do you have any other spell on your ui besides frostbolt
---
You’re definitely not wrong that they said that. I’m just saying that it doesn’t seem to be the case in all instances according to some people on this subreddit that got invites without an active subscription.
---
Maybe because he’s a douche that will not even report bugs.
---
there are better racials to have for rogue pvp, perception is a bad racial that only low skilled people advocate for
---
You're right - yet I expect people to be smart enough to get it from the context
---
&gt;0% of these major streamers hated Vanilla and hated on anyone who suggested Classic. Now they are all acting like they wanted it from the beginning.
---
*Times change*, lol
---
the cancer of low lvl bgs
---
most level 60 mains will have to 30 days / played easy by the time they're in BWL
---
I have the same setup. The vertical monitor is to my right though. The only suggestion I have is don't put anything you're reading on that monitor as you will get a strained neck very quickly. I personally would have no use for another monitor as the side monitor does its  purpose of being a Spotify/Twitch/Quest Guide display screen.
---
 I sold my original account during wotlk that I had played on since EU beta 2004, and I got a new account when cataclysm was released. I needed to go cold turkey on wow for my studies and I made a few hundred $ of it which was a lot for a poor college student back then. Now, that really came back and bit me in the ass.... :/
---
There will be many more streamers once it gets released.
---
Streamers that right now either just looked quickly into it or play offstream and prepare for release.  
---
Alkaizerx streamed the Beta for like 2 hours and leveled quickly past level 10.
---
He has every quest basically memorized and is probably the best Warrior that will play the game and this is why i find it funny when guys like Tipsout are getting called gods.  
---
Alkaizer already has a raidgroup that aims to raid in the very first week.  
---
Meaning there are people preparing to be 60 in just 2-3 days tops,attuned and geared up to be raid ready before asmongold and these other idiots are even Level 30 again.  
---
Alkaizer said when he leveled he doesn't want to show too much and maybe these other "special individuals" will figure it out on their own how to GO FAST as he said it.
---
But he says there will shoot up many players/streamers that are silent right now and will be on a complete different level because what those people do is a big fat joke.
---
Hopefully those Streamers then get the viewers because they definitely deserve it more than "world first Asmongold"
---
I mean I have 12 subs, you should mean I am in by now. I still hope, they do rolling invites and we see more popping. But doubt. EU will prob. only get 1 Wave and rest US.
---
Got in, day one account, EU.
---
Some info:
---
I have two wow accounts, haven't played on my day 1 account since wotlk, but my new main account has been subbed at least 1 month every expansion. No active subscription, but got active gametime
---
&gt;release it as a remastered...
---
But it’s not a remaster
---
I had no idea TBC was originally meant to be original content. If that's the case it wouldn't surprise me if Demon Hunter was cut because they cut pretty much all the other demon content as well. "Demon" is pretty much the entire theme of TBC after all.
---
It's important to emphasize the interface part by using it twice!
---
That's basically it yes. I wouldn't say you have to be good at resto. Just be aware of your party members and heal them and purge. It's not that difficult once you know how your class works when you leveled it up from 1-60.
---
You will have to read a bit further mate
---
440
---
It's been stated several times that you need an active subscription why are you still asking this?
---
Dude sometimes when I didn't trust the zone name above the minimap I would look at the top of my screen and see daddy Titan telling me I can relax.
---
Hey guys. When did this vertical monitor thing become a thing? When the mobile experience took over???
---
Asking for a friend.
---
funny part is the 1-30 content isn't even harder on private servers. It varies from case to case, some things are harder, others are easier. Like verdan the everliving which tipsout reported for "hitting way too hard", he is hitting for 3 times lower damage on the big private servers. Last boss in RFK too is a complete joke on private servers compared to the classic beta. Private servers are all over the place but not only in the direction of "harder".
---
Its actually ideal for them to all be on one server together. More drama, more moments between famous people, less room on the one big server for fanboys, doesn't inpact the rest of us.
---
Let the legends of the past not influence the legends of the future.
---
I've seen some setup like this and I'm wondering myself, where do you get those Alliance/Horde Banners and beautiful painting decoration?
---
Nice setup at the end, add some blue / white light for the alliance aspect, and it I'll be perfect!
---
FOR THE..... whichever side I feel like playing on at the moment.
---
Yep.  Same can be said for talents, too.  Getting 1% better chance to hit each level feels kind of boring, but by the time you cap it out it becomes noticeable.  And then you have the 1-point-wonder talents like Mortal Strike or whatever that are just a joy to get.
---
Because no one would go on the internet and lie.
---
Your main isn’t the most hours played. I farm more on my alts for mats than I play on my main. Main is what you feel is your favorite character.
---
U have le drumph, he’s BfA. And hiloli is classic! Or was it the other way around...
---
Yah but it's still asmongold watching another streamer and reacting to their video. I get what you and the others are saying. I just think its crappy content even if he doesnt upload it to YouTube. Hes primarily a twitch streamer, I get that.
---
Yeah, I really cannot keep up with it all. It seems like Blizzard have adopted the same sort of "Philosophy of Change" that a lot of popular games have these days. Some of us just want something that we like and will not completely transform every year or two!
---
Lol you're so fucking biased on this issue it isnt even worth giving you the time of day.
---
Retail has a forum for every realm, so i think classic will get that too. If not someone will probably make realm subreddits or discords.
---
Easy choice.
---
Are you a kid or an idiot? Then Horde.
---
Are you an adult or Intelligent? Alliance.
---
Just give me my omen, titan bar, and x-Perl and I’ll be set!
---
**&lt;Maelstrom&gt; NA-PvP Alliance guild recruiting more players for Classic. We’re a serious progression guild that will have 2-3-night raid schedule. T/W/TH @ 7pm central time.** 
---
**For the past few months we have been playing together on our own 1.12 test server. So far, we have been clearing MC/Ony/ZG with 20-25 people.** 
---
**Currently we’re looking for players that can participate in our Tuesday test raids. We would like to expend our roster to at least 35 players so we can start doing runs in BWL and beyond.** 
---
**Holy priest/paladin and dps warriors are in highest demand, but we’re always looking for skilled players of all classes.** 
---
**We believe that by playing together prior to the release of Classic, will give us an advantage in terms of progression as well as to allow us to get to know each other better.**
---
**If you meet the requirements and want to know more, send me a msg on discord. Frost#6270**
---
This would be great to get confirmation on. My 2006 account has been I subbed for 6+ years, but is connected to my now-main account. I made a new account because I wanted to start over with my achievements (for some stupid reason, still kicking myself).
---
Both accounts are linked to the same battle.net account, so I’m not sure if that negates it or not, I know payment history is still separate.
---
Whichever character has the biggest bags is your main.
---
you'll know you made it to the end when you approach the cliffss to head into thousand needles and a priest MC's right as you go PVP  and tosses you to your death
---
IMO whichever character you consider your main.
---
Often that's your highest level, or your most geared, or your most played, or your most played currently; but none of those are a requirement. It's 100% subjective and up to the player.
---
For instance, back in Mists I had a DK that I played in Cata and I got pretty geared. But I decided I wanted to switch classes, and stopped playing it to level a priest. Even when I had way more time /played on the DK, and he was higher geared, if you asked me then I would have called the priest my main since it's the only one I was really playing.
---
gotcha
---
Can someone post a screenshot from their Battle net account webpage of what the beta access looks like.  I have 2 PTR accounts showing up with no clear identification of either being a Classic Beta.
---
Has there been a beta where you get to keep your character? What developer did this that has no caused this question to come 98962345 a day?
---
I have never once seen a beta not get wiped. But it must have happened somewhere...
---
Damn that was a Yesmastercn level play. Good stuff Soda.
---
I will be making a twink character or two as well. I love that there's a point staying at these levels instead of just rushing to max and be stuck there all the time, hence why alts will be great, and will literally remains as *alts.*
---
As for websites, I know there's this website;
---
https://xpoff.com/
---
So have a look around there.
---
For everyone hating streamers, this sub sure does watch a lot of streamers all day.
---
&gt; We can't justify paying 18 dollars a month to play old wow
---
unlucky, private servers are there for you
---
AlkaizerX   
---
But he won't stream it much until official Release.  
---
He already has a raidgroup that wants to raid in Week 1 meaning they level fast and are prepared.  
---
He streamed Beta for like 2 hours and got way past level 10 showing how efficient you can actually be even as a Warrior pulling multiple mobs and solo everything.
---
Will be the best Warrior to play this game most likely.  
---
Hope he streams it all
---
Or the Nelf quest to pickpocket a satyr for a journal.
---
I'm more into Bearing myself.
---
I dunno man you ever done an I S L A N D  E X P E D I T I O N ?

https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427338936?t=03h58m18s
---
Everyone wants to spoil launch day.
---
High end players will exclude you from aq and naxx.
---
You really only need to take a disproportionality small amount of hunter (less than 5) in naxx. Mc -&gt; AQ can be done just fine with 5 +-2
---
I actually love those quests - they really feel like actual things you're doing and not just "hit boars to get exp". Of course it's not efficient to go across the continent and back, but that guy you need to talk to is up there so go get em champ.
---
^(A scrub tries to bubble a target instead of himself)  
---
**\******OMG BROKEN GAME\****
---
I would define it as the character that you progression raid with, although depending on your class, you may have more time invested in a farming alt to support your main, than the main itself.
---
For someone who doesn't raid, the character that you have the most time or faction rep grinding invested in, as most people wont repeat most rep grinds on multiple characters, ie, for the Frostsaber mount.
---
The cringe...
---
EU player. Didn’t get in either. 2x 2005 account.
---
FeelsBadMan ☹️
---
Almost as if people go and play whatever people want..
---
Weapon skill vs. Dodge. I feel like it's a close call for a prot warrior.
---
If that's how you feel sure. I just know I made great use of it in duels against other rogues and against NE's and druids. I felt that it was a strong tool to utilize. But I guess you were the god of uncatchable rogues in 2004 who didn't feel it was a valuable resource then so be it.
---
&gt;it just becomes the meta and you're expected to have the addon.
---
"What's your gearscore?"
---
What? BRM was absolutely a thing before bgs. So was Tyra’s hand and general epl/Winterspring/burning steppes wpvp.
---
Yeah, there weren't a ton of those. Paladins and warriors had Quel'Serrar, and of course you had the legendary chains for Hand of Rag, Thunderfury and Atiesh, but those all required a ridiculous amount of work to obtain compared to Legion's weapons.
---
EU likes the others in the thread.
---
what is your source?
---
For me it's the character with the best gear and longest commitment. So it comes down to hours too. The char I do most tasks with.
---
Supposedly it was a world boss that was planned on the eastern islands of STV, but it never went into the game but morphed into Azuregos a few patches later.
---
I like Venruki
---
I resubbed like 3 days ago to check my old char.
---
iT's aLL juSt NOsTALgiA!!
---
Did SFK with another paladin at level 22. We managed to get to the hammer without too much hassle. Lower tier instances where a joke. I wonder how UBRS, Scholo and Strat hold up with quest gear. But after having MC on farm five mans became a speed contest. Pulled an extra room? Meh, just AOE them down.
---
Honestly most of that battle could have gone much better had Asmon actually had the thought to care about strategy or tactics to win. I'm pretty sure deep down he really didn't care about the event and tried to keep throwing more bodies at the horde to get them to stop.
---
His shotcalling was dogshit. He'd announce an order then contradict it in the next literal second. Stop or push? Make up your mind man. Also I don't know if Asmond is self centered or something but shouting orders from stream only and expecting all of your raid to be tuning in is dense as fuck. He made no effort to type orders out in real time. He didn't stand by his position and ran with the headless chickens. The biggest battles ended because he couldn't take 2 seconds to think of a plan.
---
But Asmond was outmatched anyways. It was only him calling out versus Venruki, Sony and the other captain tips. Also I think individually horde had the better players. Seeming as how a bunch of arena rankers are fighting for the horde as well. Venruki's flank destroyed his side instantly. Watch the final battle back and you'd see 20 people Nova'd in the first 5 seconds of the charge.
---
Asmond's only strategy was to keep throwing bodies like that'll just work. Esfand gave 0 shits about it all and left Asmondgold to do it all himself. Useless as fuck as when Asmond was gathering up more people for a fight Esfand was dicking around in IF. Wtf?
---
Asmond also being a shit motivator didn't help. As whenever they got pushed back he berated the fuck out of his own guild coming to help him.
---
According to most polls they are at the bottom. Now, the data might be skewed by more "informed" players answering polls (and not wanting the "bad scaling" class) ... but it's been pretty consistent in the polls I've seen.
---
Wow that sounds almost like you’re enjoying the game as its meant to be. Only for some reason attributing these great server characteristics to the streamer and not the game itself, like some kind of digital Messiah. It’s funny because if I recall correctly I had great PVP/PVE events, high pop and strong economy on my server in 2005, no streamer and their fan-mob required. Trying to connect these great things you mentioned to the streamer is the problem itself. If not for it being just another unproven opinion then imagine it as a hostage situation. What do you think would happen if this person you’re referring to gets bored and stops playing the game or moves servers. This amazing and dynamic server would need life support and eventually collapse on itself whenever they decide to do so. So sorry I’ll pass on any of the above situations and find a non stream server because I promise you those will do just fine like they did in the past.
---
Definitely rolling a mage when there is no 5 resets per hour cap implemented lol. Imagine the Dire Maul farm value.
---
Shaman was easier for me!
---
1. rank 1 frostbolt
---
2.  sheep
---
3. frost nova
---
4. ice block
---
That should be enough for any frost mage.
---
It has been my favorite class released and I played first day of vanilla release so to me it would be super fun. It wouldn’t particularly fit in very well, but idfc it would be fun.
---
Dude has the pserver wr for fastest naxx clear as MT, I don't think it matters what he's clicking.
---
I believe that's generally what one should do (and may even be one of the biggest benefits of this sort of talent system \[although obviously retail essentially allows for the same thing, I guess\]):  
---
If you don't want to be (or just aren't) cutting edge, pick up the important bits, without gimping yourself, you need to do a little bit of everything and then just have fun.  
---
I sort of hate when people always want to have the best of the best, the most optimal, even if it would make bugger all difference to their day-to-day-experience while locking themselves out of other content.
---
Christ I forgot monks and pandas were still in the game...
---
Those willing to put the effort in should be rewarded no?
---
Hunters are the traditional easy mode of wow. Also the best class for new players. Hunter will always be popular.
---
In PVE it's a hard class to play well (all of it revolves around auto shot weaving), and even if you do play it well, you aren't particularly good. At least you'll save on repairs. Worst case: you have a farming toon that you can use to funnel gold to another class you want to play.
---
2006 here, non-stop subbed, no invite sadly :(
---
The one that takes priority in your consideration, I would say. The character you pick over another when you ask yourself if you want to do a certain dungeon, and you are free to pick either. The character with whose name you are referred to by your mates, maybe (though that gets kinda weird if you ever 'switch' mains).
---
What do you mean
---
Me too.
---
Didn't get one :(  
---
Acc made in 2005.  
---
Cleared C'thun and a few bosses in Naxx.  
---
Have active sub just to have a chance at beta.  
---
Please Blizzard.
---
What page did you look at that doesn't have coordinates? Most have coordinates where they are relevant. If you'd like some added you can let me know or update the page yourself since it's a wiki
---
Just wanted to let you know this was also posted on the official forums and someone tested it already. No spaces allowed.
---
The fact that it doesn't happen all the time is why it's so awesome. But it does and will happen. And there's plenty to do when it's not happening.
---
None of them honestly
---
I've considered doing the same, not gonna lie.  Plus I could check in on my dudes that have been inactive since Cata.  If I get bored enough I might, but... ehhhhhh.
---
I've come to the conclusion that leatherworking is only good for leveling but once you hit 60 it doesn't really serve a purpose. Engineering, enchanting and alchemy are great throughout and give benefits for endgame stuff.
---
Sameeee ! Thanks for the reply haha. :) good luck to you
---
Sonii accepted the 1v1 against Asmond, when Monkey agreed he refused because he didn't want to fight the captain. Also Asmon wasted his time for so long he denied the 1v1 anyway because they lost that chance apparently
---
It's actually $7.50 each for access.
---
Whether it's football, basketball, hell, even a spelling bee, it's almost always entertaining to watch a sport/competition. Why? Because you're see the culmination of these competitors hundreds and thousands of hours of practice, perfecting this *one* specialization.
---
I would agree that TOP streaming channels probably very much do look into the analytics and strategize on how they should stream, how they can improve, and set deadlines/expectations.
---
But WoW streamers being posted here? I doubt so very much, hence, why watch them?
---
I started about 60 mo before WotLK(which came out on my bday) and was lvl 58 when it dropped. I didnt get to explore Outlands very well before i was off to Northrend and would very much like to experience unlocking the heroic dungeons and the wPvP in Hellfire.
---
Would be fine if undead only had death knights scaled to vanilla, and even more interesting class that could have made it if development time was longer
---
Yeah I reported it and about 12 others. Lots of pet bugs so far.
---
My guess would be rogue.  Combat spec.  I haven’t played much of a monk, but the little bit I did felt rogueish.
---
No, people are just tired of playing BfA because it sucks.
---
Always funny when someone gets defensive and calls people kids. A lot of the angry kiddos in this subreddit are likely older than you are. I think people just don’t appreciate you being so anti classic, and then playing it for views/money because it’s popular right now.
---
Druid bear form is kinda like being a panda.
---
So how are you all knowing when your account was created? I'm late 07 i think but can't remember if i created a new account when i started playing for real vs my original 30 day gametime.
---
I may be wrong, but I feel like when I played the beta for elder scrolls online I got to keep my character once it went live? Again, could be wrong because I haven’t played it since just after the release but I swear I remember it that way.
---
Even big streamers like Shroud don’t get many people following them in game. Not every streamers community is aids. And for the ones that are, only that one or two servers will be effected. Not all of them
---
Thanks am taking a look now. Found a twinking discord so hopefully some more guidance!
---
I had grand ideas for this when it was announced and the current implementation is very disappointing. I was hoping for a Suramar type level cap questing experience.
---
Not really, its one of the best if not the best place to live.
---
That's not even the hard part of ww axe, it's the 30 trolls you have to kill. But most likely you can easily group for both as other classes will be higher level.
---
He means your auction mule.
---
Hi, /u/grizzlesax
---
Just resubbed my vanilla wow account. I had a bis lvl 19 rogue twink with fisherman’s hat, gurabashi arena trinket.. now my twink barely even stands up against anyone else leveling an alt with all their boa gear. Terrible.
---
woosh
---
If the TBC xpac had been closer to the original vanilla content and scaled to level 60 the game might not have gone downhill so signifcantly.
---
I never understood why they would add 10 levels and then reduce the amount of xp to level 1-60. You just cut the middle out of a blanket and sewed it onto the end.
---
I liked how he put it on allcraft, it's worse gameplay in a better game, and he overestimated how important class gameplay was to him I think. Will definitely be interesting to see how much he ends up playing classic.
---
There should be a PvE "casual" version and a PvP version. As well I was hoping to be more of a commander than a foot soldier in some slog. More of a MOBA feel? Maybe Tower Defense style where we could build defenses and summon/launch waves of soldiers into the enemies. Charge in beside them. Instead its gather a bit of stuff then let the NPCs do the work while you stand around.
---
So? Ye currently retail is not a good spot right now, but as OP stated they've been playing for like 5 days, a lot of them for even less, of course there's still shit to do...
---
It's surprisingly cheap to twink out at the lv19 bracket. Higher brackets are more intense but I remember being able to fund a lv19 hunter twink when my main wasn't even in the outlands during tbc. I'm looking forward to twinking again I always wanted to go hard in the lv29/39 bracket.
---
IDK. I just hope that there will be at least two RP-PvP servers now...
---
I really wish streamers would leave it alone if there is only one.
---
Could try a lock:
---
Apply dots, fear, skillcoil, GG
---
2005 account here, played every expansion, currently subbed, no beta yet.
---
Really? With the costs of gaming today, THIS is what breaks the camels back?
---
Does time of start matter and do finishes matter? I was 2005 NA, quit in LK. Not sure if worth buying 30 days for a super low chance to get in.
---
Mage IMO.  core gameplay is a little bit simpler as you have fewer in-combat options.  You basically kite / CC / damage depending on situation and you have a basic spell (or two) for each one. 
---
Shaman have so many different totems they can drop depending on the fight, and they also have to constantly decide whether or not to cast an offensive spell, defensive spell, totem or go for melee strikes or positioning.  
---
Speaking as a shaman too you will run out of keybind space on all 6 action bars from all the totems.  You won't be able to bind it all!  Granted some are barely ever useful but still.  Mage will never run out of action bar space- plenty of room for all relevant spells plus a few downrank options if need be like r1 frostbolt or r1 arcane explosion to tag mobs / get stealthers.
---
Nothing for me, created account 29th april 2005 eu
---
but at least I know eu can get in now.. but does it require bfa?
---
Psst - He probably plays Retail  
---
Wants everything for free and everyone should have everything.  
---
I remember back then all these Level 19 rogues with insane gear and paying high prices i believe for certain items.  
---
Fun times.
---
There are probably only 3-4 streamers I would consider big enough for them to be a "streamer server". Soda, Asmon/Esfand (same server), Timthetatman, Shroud, and maybe Lirik.
---
Ok cool, I'm curious about the elite results compared to pservers.
---
Games have move past you at this point my dude. Even back in vanilla we were loading up on addons. Time to step out of the crypt and get some air. Addons make players better, not worse. Your logic is beyond flawed.
---
I think the biggest concern people really have is stuff like login-queues, I'd be pretty bummed out if I came home and couldn't play because a hundred asshats wanted to follow an even bigger asshat ^((not saying WoW-Streamers are asshats, but this sentence wouldn't be the same without calling them that)) around.  
---
I'm less concerned about things like the AQ-Mount a) because I wouldn't get it in a thousand years and b) because that's still a long way away and if they are that fanatical and ridiculous they can start a damn cult for all I care.
---
That’s a Nay
---
Oh boy, then my warrior I’ve been playing since TBC has never been my main.
---
(I didn’t ever find a point to expand my bag size while my other characters ended up with more large bags.)
---
BFA? What is that? 
---
I logged on the other day when I added a subscription in Hope's of beta access and the server felt so dead. 
---
Not a single person in trade chat. 
---
When I used to play in vanilla and TBC the chat was going so fast I would have to scroll up to see what people where talking about.
---
shooting that poor dragon in the dick
---
Just got mine, day one EU player. Have BFA and reactivated my sub a couple days ago, event if it is not required.
---
Now what?  Do we play the game?
---
This WILL 100% happen on release WITHOUT streamers. Maybe not to prevent someone to get a lvl 30 weapon but definitely this type of shit happened all the time.
---
Gotcha https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv/clip/CrazyModernMouseDatSheffy
---
Mine is 06 and still nothing
---
&gt; 2004 EU acc
---
seems legit
---
its going to take a heap of days to hit 60 then months to not be intrash gear
---
its not super easy to gear an alt uness you no lifel
---
people actually want 6 months wtf. A YEAR UNTILL BGS COME OUT AND 6 MONTHS FOR HONOR TO RELEASE
---
How loosely? The girl is very pretty.
---
Seems like some ppl did, but i did not see it that way and understand what you meant. Rly glad to see streamers doing this epic stuff, even if it’s one of the few things left for them to do on the beta.
---
Some of my most fond memories are leveling up my lvl 33 hunter, running through a pvp zone just to see a cloud of red text and learn enemies were raiding my little questing town. 
---
It was just a regular day. So much fun.
---
have they even done 06 yet?
---
think my launcher is bugged :/ can't find it.
---
In an interview on class design (I'm not sure where but it's somewhere on youtube with the original guy who did class design) it was said that the original intention was to have it be some sort of progression for nelf warriors.
---
From the EU beta invite thread,
---
"I GOT IT I AM CRYING.
---
2005 EU release account. GF also got it!! She is on a 2010ish Cataclysm account."
---
I've expressed similar thoughts or questions here and been downvoted to oblivion by people calling me poor, or entitled, or what have you.  
---
I really don't get it, it's like everyone here enjoys the right to pay for literally the most expensive PC game on the market even though it is 15 years old.
---
Probably rogue maybe enhance shaman but really monk is completely different from any class in vanilla. Just pick a class that interests you the most.
---
yeah this is straightup wrong. there are a lot of places that people farm out in the world and pvp definitely happens in these places. silithus cultists, arathi elementals, un'goro devilsaurs, azshara satyrs, hearthglen, root tubers in felwood, etc etc etc
---
there is SO MUCH motivation to be out in the world, pvp is a natural consequence of limited resources.
---
No email for me. Only in launcher.
---
What's cringe?
---
Rogue is probably the most similar in terms of resource management, Warrior as well.
---
My friend is NA he just got in. You can imagine the jealous rage I have.
---
Yes! I fucked up yesterday was doing level 20 rogue quest went to use the box to chain lock pick for skill ups deleted the item from the chest forgetting that it abandons the whole quest so now I'm a rogue with the 7 day poison on me with no quest lol
---
They are not cartoony to a level of not believeable in the world where that gun is. Who would have made it? Why would they give it big eyes? Why would they make it bright red? The opening mouth situation whilst cool to us would be entirely impractcal as a weapon even in this fantasy setting.
---
Yeah but not here. This thread is specifically for people who plan to use this for themselves. In fact it's now sold out on amazon likely from people buying it for legitimate use.
---
I don’t know if it will be a thing, but it definitely was more of a thing than what you stated.
---
It's not clear from this statement that you must have a subscription to get invited. It could just mean that you need one to play after you've been invited.
---
I must admit the new water suits WC.
---
19 rogues FTW.
---
29 Druids.
---
Same here lol. Sold 2 vanilla accounts back in the day then activated my current account during TBC.
---
Both times I was pretty addicted to WoW, so the free time and extra money helped a lot with college. Not going to say I regret it.
---
It would have been cool playing with all the WoW celebrities on beta though. Otherwise launch is going to be much better!
---
I've been trying to go through all the bugs I can. I think they missed the weapon skill training. I was able to train 2 handed axes on my level 1 troll warrior. I remember that being level 10 gated.
---
Yes, right here:
---
https://blizzard.com/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html
---
I logged onto my lvl 19 twink rogue the other day and was running around org saying please blizzard invite me to the classic beta. Did that for about 20 minutes, they didnt grant my request :( 
---
I'll try again today.
---
We don't need that astronomical number.
---
Let the flock go to a PvE server with asmon, the ones interested in PvP will have a way healthier enviroment to play with the smaller streamers, that will still put out some impressive numbers for us to kill/help. :)
---
Arguably you have more to do in bfa than ever. But nothing of it has a meaning or seems fun to players.
---
Do those receiving beta invites just see it in the drop-down or do they get an email as well?
---
My friend made his account in WOTLK on NA and got in.
---
Hearthstone beta let you keep your progress after a certain wipe happened.
---
Yeah, I but twinks are still cancer.
---
Its way way better than the stupid heirlooms at least
---
horde has windfury
---
I agree completely. I think outlands should have been like 53-60 level. With only like blades edge, netherstorm, and shadowmoom valley being true level 60 zones (like i consider silithus to be the only true level 60 zone in vanilla and MAYBE you could count EPL but it is closer to 58-60)
---
One might think it would be pointless to add lower than max level zones to the game, but they would forget that a majority of farming that level 60s did for gold was not on max level creatures. The satyrs in felwood or azhara come to mind. Thosr spots became saturated so maybe add another just through the dark portal. Add some long class chain quests in outlands but don't invalidate the old raid content but making the blues and greens of outland have stats that are way too high.
---
I normally would say whatever character you have the Most things completed on, Like highest reputation, or the toon you log on to finish events right away for.  
---
I would also say the character that has the most gold on it, but given that I always make bank alts now, I would say that to be false. I also spend a lot of time on my alts that do farming, and I would not consider them to be mains either since all i'm doing is grinding materials or gold.
---
There is challenge in retail, but it's been loaded into the mythic+ and mythic raids of endgame. Leveling is just a timegate to having a character to play in that content
---
I tend to watch the calmer, more sensible and less popular streamers. It's just more fun to watch a normal person playing than some egomaniac clown like most "top tier" streamers are.
---
I've seen you on Asmons stream, you've been very lucky with the drops, gz :P
---
[I'm also a female dwarf player, can't wait to be my old self again](https://i.redd.it/qjabqsfupdq11.jpg)
---
A pal with righteous fury should definitely be able to hold any single-target aggro with just the two of you.  Unless you get unlucky with resists/misses.
---
Why do you need party interface in a raid? It's taking too much space
---
Stay safe, esfand, tipsout??
---
All wargameing games pretty much. Beta player got to keep some free xp and credits
---
Not true. My friend didn’t join until WOTLK and got in. People are spreading all sorts of rumors, like this is EU only when he’s NA. They’re doing it randomly.
---
They're not
---
I don't need to look into it to know you don't know what you're talking about, lol
---
Operation CWAL, maybe blizz will build the game faster.
---
&gt; No, I do not assume that. But if you dont need gear to do the hardest content, why have gear with stats at all? You could say the same for mythic+, you play to push the highest keys, not to obtain gear (as a goal). 
---
You could always gear your character through other means in order to step inside the raid. That has been solidly one of World of Warcraft's design pillars.
---
&gt; In PvP we already have this. It shouldnt be about gear, it should be about rating and skill; said a ton of people. Now we have effectively no gear in PvP, just set stats instead. 
---
Incorrect. That was only valid for Legion. In Battle for Azeroth you have all items working in PvP, which ends up making PvPers having to do raid content in order to get the most competitive items. Yes, there are PvP trinkets that work great in player versus player combat (like Maledict, the one putting a healing absorb in your target), but every single raid so far has deployed tank trinkets that are absurdly OP in PvP.
---
&gt; I disagree with the two last paragraphs completely. Sure, for some people raiding was all about boss progression, but I dont think it started out that way for most. I think most players back in Vanilla wanted to be as strong as they could be in this world. They did quests and levelled all the way up to 60. Alright, how to I become stronger now? Dungeons. Crafting. Okay, im already strong.. but I can still go further! Raids. Raids was the final step in the progression ladder. Now that the ladder has been removed, and everything scales and gear is pretty much a meaningless number.. well, the incentive to raid is gone for a lot of people, and character progression died with it; and so did the interest in the game.
---
Most players in Vanilla wanted to be as strong as they could and didn't really care for progression in the first place? Yes. That's true. That's precisely the mentality I'm criticizing: people should see progress as the end reward, not gears (which will always be just numbers, some with a fancy name, others not so much).
---
Everything scales? Up to a point. World content stops scaling at a certain ilevel. If you're a good player who knows how to play your class and gets the deserved gear for the content you've cleared, you will outscale the world.
---
If the incentive to raid is gone because people who cared mostly about gear are losing their interest, then as a mythic raider I must say that's for the best. It's very hard to rely on people who are only there for item upgrades. They are greedy. They don't think as a team. They don't act as a team. They are in only for themselves.
---
Communities are great are changing perspectives in a large scale. And the WoW community, for its own good, should change their perspective regarding the rewards of raiding.
---
And there are quest chains in legion for unlocking transmogs for the class weapon that are just as hard and long as Thunderfury or Hand of Rag.
---
Now, im not saying its the same since in one case you get a transmog and in the other you get a legendary weapon that only a handful of players can have. But if we are putting emphasis on the quest-part then they are comparable. I would probably even say that if you ignore the reward there are many quest chains in Legion that are way more impressive than the epic or legendary quest chains in Vanilla. The only quest i can think of that is more epic is the AQ Scepter quest chain.
---
I did get it on my account made in 2016 that I've created for legion since my old bc acc couldn't be recovered. EU region and just checked🙂
---
My friend also asked if the second monitor would not disturb the „feeling“ while playing ?
---
I want a  classic wow release at midnight at my local Ebay games or best buy that would be so fun . See all the people that show up and get hyped. FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
Same here my friend!  No serious raiding ambitions, but boy am I going to be loaded... I genuinely love farming gold.  Between gold farming and leveling alts I could play this game for years.
---
Play a different game. Wow has sucked for 4 expansions in a row and people got by.
---
not really, but tbh classic streams got boring after day 1 too...
---
&gt;pets are not used in raids 
---
❌
---
&gt;1 hunter is good for raid 
---
❌ 
---
Next!
---
Thanks for the tip! Looks like I have a new hobby to supplement my Bnet launcher hobby!
---
Imagine releasing a game with double the vanilla content, vanilla and tbc released as 1 game, with all raids at max level and the levels evenly spread out (not the 60+10 thing). That can last 5 years and then go on a 2 or 3 year server whipe cycle while this wow2 of equal or bigger size is released as next chapter in the story?
---
"That's a semantic argument. SoR adds Holy damage to your weapon swings, but that doesn't necessarily mean it must proc things in the same way a white weapon swing would—and once again, their patch notes imply that it wasn't intended to:"
---
"An additional Holy damage component attached to a normal weapon swing doesn’t count mechanically as a second weapon swing in any other instance."
---
blizzard patch notes - "Judgement of Righteousness - The damage of this judgement was increased significantly. This judgement can now trigger procs. The bonus from spell damage items has been increased slightly." judgement of righteousness, not a white swing and is a spell that uses 1.5 spell crit table can now trigger procs. so its not unreasonable that SoR can too. and even if this patch change didnt exist i still think its reasonable that a paladins seal system thats a replacement for on demand melee abilities can proc effects.
---
"EDIT: To add blue post evidence on Reckoning from 2005.
---
reckoning isnt intended either to be saved up for charges... i guess they should fix that unintended feature of storing 4 stacks of reckoning
---
You're 100% wrong. The original design intention was for Reckoning to have a stackable charge system. The mistake was allowing it to hold infinite charges. They realized this when one player famously one-shot a World Boss. The history of Reckoning is summarized in this blue post. One of the most telling sections is in the F.A.Q.:
---
“Isn't this ‘Reckoning Bomb’ an exploit?
---
Several months ago Reckoning received a bug hotfix of its own. This hotfix put a hard cap of 4 on the number of charges capable of being stored. So, one can safely assume that the developers know exactly what is going on, and have chosen to allow it.”
---
“When will Reckoning be fixed to be instant?
---
Recently, a dev did say they were working to fix some bugs with Reckoning, as to make it so charges would not be dropped if you did not reach melee range with the target before you took a swing at them, but no date has been named.”
---
It seems that from the beginning of the game, the method for balancing Reckoning's inconsistency was a charge system that allowed you to save weapon swings so they wouldn't be completely wasted.
---
What wasn't intended was the /sit bug—to manually create a stack by /sitting. This was a separate hotfix from the infinite-charges hotfix. Here's a different blue post talking about the /sit bug being removed:
---
“Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?”
---
“Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit.”"
---
again nothing here is proof at all that reckoning was intended to act the way it does. these are simply blizzard talking about the mechanic after the fact it was discovered with one shotting the world boss. and the things you come up with wtf? "It seems that from the beginning of the game, the method for balancing Reckoning's inconsistency was a charge system that allowed you to save weapon swings so they wouldn't be completely wasted." what the heck? yeah im sure blizzard let you stack 4 charges and unleash 5 attacks in a single swing was intended because you could lose swings. no the reason you lost swings is part of the bug itself that you can store charges. you lose swings when you have auto attack enabled and you are to far from your target and thus you cant swing at him and you lose your extra attack. 
---
but even though anyone knows reckoning isnt intended to be a charge system, i asked kevin jordan and he said himself that it was never intended to be a charge system and instead a crit and react basis.
---
It really isn’t. Doing more threat is paramount, and taking 1% less damage (on average) will almost never make any difference.
---
I last played during Legion, for about a month. Got a demon hunter to 110 and just felt like i was robbed. didnt reup my sub and just cant even bring myself to resub for a chance at beta, if even to play on old toons. Its totally not worth it, imo. Retail is boring, simple, and demoralizing.
---
It’s interesting. Spamming general and trade chat with “LF2M dps stocks” isn’t exactly engaging gameplay, and an addon could get ppl together faster.
---
The major issue with modern day “LFG” is the teleportation to the dungeon.
---
Pantheon, an upcoming “oldschool” MMO created by the creator of Everquest will have a group finder built in.
---
The “vanilla” goal was never to make getting a group together difficult, it was to make getting to the dungeon difficult. You could always easily just say “lfg healer gnomer” in general chat and find a group, if there were people out there wanting to do gnomer. The big issue an addon would solve was chat channels, and having to go to the main cities to use trade chat there.
---
So, if we want to make ppl go back to main cities to find groups, or if we want to force people to use chat channels which make the world seem alive, then i could see that argument, although it isn’t very strong.
---
An addon will only facilitate finding a group, but it won’t reward extra xp, nor teleport you, and so I find that ok. Classic will be different from vanilla, in terms of the meta-game and player interaction, but as long as the gameplay is as close as possible, that’s all we can really hope for.
---
I was going to make some dumb joke about how casual you are for not playing WoW when you were two years old. Then the reality of a 16 year-old being *two* when I started playing WoW sunk in and had an existential crisis.
---
I can feel my telomeres degrading as I type this now.
---
Honestly if they want an objective based war zone why not just say the actual open world of arathi is a war zone from Friday to Sunday, with waves of soldiers that players can assist to turn the tide (Moba style) and then at the end the world state for the next week depends on the performance of the weekend. Wardrobes could have been an opportunity to elevate world pvp not rival it.
---
It's a good thing you didn't care much for Disc... Because pre mid wrath... It was a useless spec...
---
Cuz I’m lonely and unable to play video games atm.
---
I’m sure on classic it will still mostly rely on how much time you put into it more than anything.  They knew how to dodge and collude with other guilds to trade off r14s so I’m sure that swifty knows what’s it takes.  It’ll be interesting to see if he can do it this time around.
---
LFG effectively castrated the aspect of what a virtual world should feel like when people come together to perform any great feat like raiding, dungeons, wpvp, and raiding opposite faction major city’s. I am in love with the idea of appealing to an audience of virtual characters that care for the well being of a world, or game-state, VS. the retail baby who “must have” certain features to deem the world enjoyable. MAGA(Make Azeroth Great Again)!!!!!
---
Someone from Cata got in so apparently yes.
---
Thanks for the insight.  But Asmon never wanted a 1v1 and openly rejected the idea.
---
I'm loving these so much
---
Gz everyone who got in. Kill a few boars for me please &lt;3
---
Yea. Just simmer until then. No point. I still enjoy the more focused YouTube videos and folks talking about different aspects but I don’t want to watch anyone level from 1-10 for example :)
---
What time did he get his invite?
---
Gear score hahahaha  
---
Oh boy  
---
Just a hint : Keep Items with Nature Resistance even if they are lower level.
---
Why?Because you need them in high end raiding or you can sell them for a lot of gold later on =)  
---
This isn't some garbage game where the only thing matters is gearscore
---
Seems like an EU only wave. Grats guys! Enjoy it!
---
I booked two weeks vacation for the release. I plan on pulling all nighters and being a total nerd for 2 weeks. I will however still try to hit the gym at least once a day though, cant afford to lose the gains.
---
usually the character with the best gear and the one you spend the most time one.
---
thanks
---
Cant use spaces / underscores in pet names.
---
I'm at college talking only one class this summer, and I still don't want to spoil classic by playing the beta. My account is from 2005 or 6, so I imagine I might've been able to get in, but I want to save the magic for launch. Only thing I'd want to in the beta is world PVP, and that's just not worth what you give up by playing it
---
As long as it’s streamer V streamer, I might have to have an alt on one of their servers just to partake.
---
Maybe interest and general fun?
---
Was literally about to post a similar comment on another mouth breather that asked about beta character progress being carried over to release.... it's honestly not worth the effort. Lazy people will always be lazy.
---
I always thought they just used rank 1 frostbolt to kite?
---
You're welcome to your incorrect opinion.
---
Dwarves will definitely be the portliest
---
imo play what you're interested in. you can't go wrong with resto shamans. a lot of groups/raids will want you.
---
missing: All hours
---
\&gt; You could always gear your character through other means in order to  step inside the raid. That has been solidly one of World of Warcraft's  design pillars.   
---
Again, you are not understanding where im coming from. I dont care where or how you get the gear, what I am saying is that gear in retail is pretty much redundant. You could remove gear and the game would be just fine, so I ask again, why have gear with stats at all?
---
When your alt gets ganked for the third time, it’s the toon you log into to put a stop to the camping.
---
Pay attention to every new ability you get as you level.  It may seem useless at the time but every ability has a purpose, and Blizz often put abilities on mobs at about the same level to force you to use these new abilities. 
---
For your first character start with just gathering professions as your primaries (skinning + herbalism or mining) and also do first aid + cooking.  First aid and cooking are very easy and cheap ways to strengthen your character, and cooking can be an easy way to make money either by just vendoring the food you cook as you level or by selling higher level food as it becomes sought after and valuable once you can cook food that requires level 35.  Don't worry about crafting professions until you're first char is about level 60 as then you'll get more of a sense of what you might want, and crafting proffs require a lot of money to invest before you make money thus its really hard to do with your first char as a new player. 
---
Classic WoW is more of a chess match than a fast paced, click-spamming game.  It's not really about who can react .1 seconds quicker, but who makes the best decisions.
---
I was just glad they finally did SOMETHING with Stromgarde.
---
Even those I don't find that much of a challenge... although I haven't played retail in a long time, so perhaps they've made it so that you actually have to think through your pulls, what you CC, focus fire, manage aggro, etc on trash pulls and not just bosses.
---
Yes, layering will distort things, as I said in my first post. Once layering is gone the cap would come down to the normal cap, because that is how the game is designed. I'm not sure where the disconnect here is. 
---
The game is meant for 2500 people on a server as a max, there will be more people layered on 2500 pop layers because they don't want dead servers when the tourists leave. After they leave the numbers solidify and the layers go away, anything above cap is queued.
---
&gt;Not to mention that Blizzard's stance on private servers is that they are illegal and unwelcome. 
---
That's an unreasonable way to look at it. Big private servers threaten the IP of blizzard, thus using legal means to protect it (C&amp;D). If you'd be blizzard you wouldn't allow your (world of) warcraft IP to be threatened, it's worth so much money.
---
HOL UP! Is that a Demon Hunter on the original box? It took me 14 years to spot it :O
---
What kind of time zones are you guys looking into for the guild?
---
He corrected it and said its a 2005 account. False Alarm.
---
Do you want to be in a "World First Progression" Guild?  
---
Yes?Then you better minmax and play what is needed.  
---
You better already get your raidspot now because there actually raids preparing for that.
---
You aren't part of the 1% Hardcore population?  
---
Then why do you care?
---
Play what is fun and what you like
---
damn my real life responsibilities, i want to no life this game so badly!
---
&gt; Just enough time for them to fix all the bugs
---
This sounds great
---
I feel your pain bro.  I was in high school in 2004 and had the money to play, but I grew up out in the boonies, and my parents had worse than 56k internet until 2008.  Back in my day if someone picked up the phone to make a call, you got booted off the internet.  WoW didn't happen for me until 2006 solely because of that, and as a HUGE fan of all 3 Warcraft games it hurt.
---
No mail for me, just look in your launcher.
---
Raid groups:
---
Feral Kittens, one max, mostly as an off-tank.
---
Boomkins, nope.
---
Arms/2H Warriors, nope.
---
BM or Survival Hunters, nope.
---
Subtlety Rogues, nope.
---
Shadow Priests, one max.
---
Disc Priests, one max.
---
Protection Paladins, nope.
---
Ret Paladins, nope.
---
Arcane Mages, nope.
---
Enhance Shamans, nope.
---
Elemental Shamans, nope.
---
Warlock is the ONLY class that has spec viability in all 3 trees for progression raiding.
---
 No email yet but I'm In
---
How do you find out if you got in ? ive been checking my email and battle net. 
---
Also do you have to have a active subscription to get in ?
---
yeah they're not...raid leaders will tell you to dismiss the pets except for a few bosses where you could use them to soak a debuff and then dismiss it. most of the time they caused more harm than good. and yes if you had a raid with more than 1 hunter (who just pulled, use tranq shot), you were hurting your overall dps numbers. in classic, and even in vanilla, was it impossible to do raids with more than 1 hunter? no, but for every hunter you kept over a warrior or mage, you just hurt your overall dps. and that's not something you can argue against. it's math.
---
Part of the problems with expansions is you only have to level 10 levels which really doesnt take long and it doesnt make you feel invested in the new area that you level In. 
---
Classic is great  because you have to grow 60 levels and it takes really long so you learn the world you explore and meet tons of friends along the way. 
---
Classic is a true RPG and I think anyone that gives it a chance will love it just like the people who played in back in the day. 
---
I cant wait and I look forward to meeting new and old friends along the way.
---
The criticism if retail is perfectly valid. In a sea of MMORPGs that have a terribly unsatisfying leveling experience (in lieu of endgame content focus), it's a breath of fresh air to have MMORPGs that are actually fun to level in.
---
It's very important to me, and many others I am sure, that a game is consistently fun through the entire game, not just the endgame. If a game doesn't grab me while I'm level 1-20, how can you expect me to keep playing until it "gets good"? Those early levels in an MMO matter! 
---
It's like reading a book or watching a TV series - if those first 3 chapters or first 3 episodes don't grab you, why would you watch the rest and risk wasting your time on something not worth while? If those first 3 chapters/episodes ARE good, you know that the rest of the series has a much higher chance of being good/worthwhile.
---
daily reminder that BGs had more of a negative effect on world pvp than flying mount
---
Too accurate. I just ended up buying game time cards though. Going to the store to get a new game time card was an adventure itself.
---
Enhancement Shaman.
---
Not gonna lie, I mainly am gonna play it because my one and only character in retail has always been an Enhancement Shaman and because I'm gonna be levelling it anyway, why abandon the spec and my knowledge on how to use it entirely?
---
Why it's not viable is for a variety of reasons. First off, that damn debuff limit preventing Flame Shock or Stormstrike from being used at all (I despise this shit). There's also the hybrid tax that many specs fall victim to. Pretty much every class that can heal is forced to heal because their DPS or tanking ability was made to be worse in order to balance out the fact that they can heal.
---
Pretty much anything really. I'm just gonna work on getting a good balance of Strength, Agility, and also Intellect for when I need to use shocks or off-heal.
---
Hell no.

Also. I'm gonna add why I think one Enhancement (hopefully me) could be justified in a raid. Their Strength, Agility, and Windfury Totems are improved with certain deep Enhancement talents, so an Enhancement Shaman can plop down a Strength totem  and switch between the Agility totem and Windfury totem to make their rogue and warrior buddies happy. Technically a healer can spec 0/22/29 to do this too but what healer is gonna want to balance that responsibility along with their responsibility to heal
---
Oh and also theres Nightfall when Phase 3 hits so that's cool
---
I can't wait to get that sick gun that shoots fireballs.
---
Also people should keep in mind, Asmongold and others don’t want the servers to be fucked and circling around them. They want to play. They waited 15 years, they don’t want hundreds of players around them jumping and tagging mobs. 
---
What they say is somewhat true, with how many streamers are on twitch, every server will have probably at least one that is slightly known. Doesn’t mean it has to affect everything in a bad way tho
---
&gt; minor trivial details he might have missed over the course of a 12-hour gaming session.
---
You mean details he put in his videos consistently? He's not being criticized for misspeaking, misremembering or believing a lie to be fact during his long streams, it's that he consciously spouts incorrect information as fact in his produced and supposedly researched videos.
---
His videos where he states his opinion on quests for example, are great.
---
I started with shitty fiery weapon on my assasins dagger cause I just couldn't afford 15 agility. The struggles.

Can confirm. Having a class with a pet is very important in gnomer.

My very first week is going to be like 60-80 hours, as I took the whole week off from work.  After that I'll probably level out around ~30-35 per week as I cut back to a few hours each night plus giant Friday/Saturday binge sessions.

---
nah - Leatherworking can be super helpful in making money, you just have to farm the needed rep grinds. 
---
Cenarion Circle once AQ phase hits has some great NR gear you can craft on demand for raiders, and charge a decent fee. 
---
Thorium Brotherhood has one of the best spellpower belts in the game for a druid/shaman for quite a while at revered. 
---
Farm the reps, establish yourself as a crafter on the server, and make good tips by being available for people.
---
I made tens of thousands in vanilla this way, especially once you get your practice rolling, you start investing your cash earned into more mats, figure out what sells well and start listing pre-made stuff on the AH instead of just crafting on demand.
---
Telling you, NR gear was a goldmine.
---
I can also confirm that the refresh button on this sub and sorting by new are also functioning just fine. There's been no shortage of idiots asking the same easily-googlable fucking questions and posting extremely low effort memes every hour.

Thats a very good question. If this would be a general problem, so that the Beta is not showing up for everyone that got invited, then i would say it's a bug in the client. But that we know that it is working for other people, i would say that if that really happens it is not a bug of the client itself!
---
Holy priest will be the best all around healer with shaman and Druid behind. Priests level as shadow but can still heal any 5 man pre 60.
---
Mythic+ is an endlessly scaling dungeon system that has a timer on your run so you have to plan out the entire dungeon beforehand with all the pulls and then execute it properly to make the timer/not wipe endlessly, it's quite neat especially in how it allows you to truly push your characters and group to their limits
---
My guess is anywhere between 1 and 45,000 servers.
---
I haven’t gotten a beta invite yet so i’ve been playing realistic xp priv server as of last night. I got level 1-6 rogue and was thinking about how quests will be on release day. I feel like the quest to kill samuel fipps, the quest kill the scarlet messenger, and the quest to collect 6 savaged goods will take forever with everyone trying to do them at once. You said you got 1-10 just grinding in 2 hours, that’s pretty good, did you do that as an undead? if so mind telling me what mobs you were farming, because doing most of the undead starting quests might not be viable on release day.

As someone who has leveled to 120 in Retail and given it more than a fair chance, not even the 100-110 or the 110-120 levels are fun, and the raiding/dailies aren't any good either. The raids take skill, sure, but the entire experience just feels soulless.

[Here](https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_231/page/n95)'s something interesting on the subject.
---
&gt; Just about to be implemented are the Hero classes. Once you hit level 40 or so, you can start specializing in skills to become the same kind of hero units found in WarCraft III. Of course, besides skills, there are race and class restrictions to keep in mind. For example, it will be the dwarven fighter who becomes the Mountain King (a favorite among the Blizzard staff), or the Night Elf Hunter who becomes the Demon Hunter.
---
So then the question becomes "What would classic Hero classes have been like?" Just guessing I think they would be like the Priest racials we've seen, with each race/class combination getting 2 to 4 special abilities on top of their basic class abilities. I think Demon Hunters specifically would get some good melee-focused abilities that pair well with the already completely melee-focused Survival tree (of the time).
---
Do you have any proof to back that up?!?!? 
---
That's great, thank you!
---
Low vote count for getting into the beta because they are all too busy playing the beta lol
---
&gt; 60-80 hours, as I took the whole week off from work.

Thanks for you cool story
---
This was actually pretty common for awhile.  It was a massive selling point when Lineage2 launched and I know plenty of non Korean games have a head start to beta testers and then let you buy into beta with preorders ect.  I remember earth and beyond did it off the top of my head.
---
Disagree there. Last night was super entertaining
---
You're getting old
---
Classic is a MULTIPLAYER Online Roleplaying Game  
---
BFA and since the end of wrath WoW turned into a Singleplayer Game in which you have some randoms with names around you on your way to picking up your easy fat epics and legendaries.
---
A strong point of Classic is the sense of Community.
---
Everyone is running through the world instead of flying.
---
You need to work together with others - No easy cheap way to get geared.
---
Most of the people talking negative about Classic are also people that usually mention they hated these forced interactions and grouping up to get somewhere with their character.
---
They want a Singleplayer Game with an Online Requirement.
---
This is why they like BFA - The dopamine from aquiring loot is rushing through their brains making them feel great and these addons are designed around that.
---
Everyone gets everything without much effort or even knowing they actually play an Online Game.
---
Also in Classic (and BC) everything stayed relevant.
---
Meaning the Content stretched sideways adding to the experience instead of going upwards making everything before new things got patched in completely useless.
---
Back then they managed to keep everything equally important somewhat.
---
These days?Its all about "ogogogo rush 2 mins dungeons clear need fat loot"
---
you are totally right
---
This definitely wins the award for the longest whining about not being able to join a closed beta that is not open to many people at the moment.
---
Propably too many.
---
All these people playing 10+ hours a day for a week straight?  How?  You don't sleep? or Work?
---
While I'll concede that's a challenge, it's not the right kind of challenge for me. Take away the timer so that you can have fun, explore, fuck up and have shit hit the fan and miraculously survive (except for the DPS, because you have to save the healer and the tank first), and then rez everyone up while you take a deep breath and try to bring your heart rate back down.
---
It's that "race through everything" mindset that completely kills retail for me.
---
Hit a flight path? Do pushups/situps/BW squats while you fly.
---
On a boat? Slap a chinup bar on the doorframe and knock out reps while you sail the high seas.
---
Autorunning a long ass way? Run in place while your char runs.
---
See, there's no need to even leave the house!
---
Thanks for all the responses.  Even the pali one.  I do a ret pali and couldn't get into the wack-a-mole feeling that I felt with him in legion, so just ret for BFA.
---
I'm thinking holy for now.  I'll keep an eye out on the healing days in this discord tho.
---
How is his ice block hitting at 74 hp every time? I may have miss-seen, so please dont get all shitty. Is he good at hitting ice block at the perfect moments, or is it a macro or addon?
---
Garts
---
I won't be working, but every Tuesday and Thursday night I have D&amp;D sessions with large friend groups.  I'm the DM of the Thursday game so I can't leave them hanging there.  I'm also accounting for breaks and sleep and such.  I'm going to play *a lot,* but I'm not going to run myself ragged on it.
---
I watched it back on Asmons, you're right but lmao he rejected it so quick. The plan Sony had was epic. Both sides would temporarily truce and let the two commanders fight in the field while both armies watched and the winner would be decided there. Sony was a little annoyed such a good idea got thrown to waste cause Asmond was agitated.
---
I love his scurry! I can't wait for them!
---
World PvP was huge during Vanilla, on my server at least (Burning Blade).
---
Great feedback. thanks.
---
MrrRRgGGlLLLggglglgrrrrlglglgglellllllllllll!
---
Yes a lot.  Lineage2 has a massive open beta that lasted I think a month and nothing was deleted.
---
I remember preordering earth and beyond and getting into the beta and while that was a long time ago I don’t remember having to start over.
---
I feel like it happened in a few other games that o can’t quite remember.  Planetside maybe?
---
Moonfire! Moonfire! Attempts Wrath.. knockback... knockback..., fuck it, Moonfire!
---
Good ol' Druids.  Rofl
---
lol half the game is fighting over resources
---
and teh most fun thing in the game to do is wipe other people's buffs....
---
Black Rock Mountain will be a warzone near primetime
---
Oh my god is this real
---
Man. I only played TBC and Wrath (pservers as well) but even then I don’t have any idea what my log in info and stuff was for my account :( I wonder if in the later waves I’d have a chance if I subbed and found my old account.
---
if people want to make an addon whats the harm? i mean, if you don't want to use em you don't have to.
---
So subbing for the beta = classic wow isn’t what it was supposed to be. Well alright it’s a beta but yeah
---
It's a pretty obvious bug, I wouldn't worry about it. Will be fixed for sure. If they wanted to stop griefing they would have done 1000 other things first, not prevent you from CC other peoples' mobs.
---
Ottering works too. Both better than twinking.
---
Crazy invention a few years ago, you may have heard of it, Google has SOOOOOOO much information and all you have to do it type it in....
---
Eventually I will.  heck with Rogues having Combat spec back, I'll start one up.  I loved that spec till it got replaced.  There goes my Rogue at 110 still :-(
---
bless me with your left over rng pls
---
WoW released feb 2005 in europe. So I'm calling pants on fire :p
---
I mean, haven't we all been there?
---
Oh man, im so so so sorry that you didn't get into the beta.
---
Can I get you some ice cream
---
Lol realized the video loops... leaving the post up for the haters
---
I played Lineage2 beta and and didn’t wipe when it released, it was actually a selling point.
---
gratz btw :)
---
Did you report it?
---
I really hope they pull that stuff out. We don't wanna play bumper bowling. Keep that crap to pve servers. I want maximum grief. I want to be steeped in hatred again. This generation of horde knows nothing of hate. Soft beds and softer orcs. Our hate was pure back then. Pure and exquisite.
---
Yeah I'm gonna miss being able to spam battle shout on my team repeatedly for ridiculous aoe threat
---
Came here to post vQueue. Updoots for vQueue.
---
Onebag is also good.
---
I am curious if anyone will actually read this entire post lmao
---
No it doesn’t. They don’t even have pvp servers now. Now you only fight against others who also are looking for a fight. There is no war. Only agreed battles.
---
Do you guys know if Wowhead is gonna work for classic?
---
I'm planning on 3 from the start, but I also really like playing a shaman, so I might have to do four.
---
Absolutely. Once they realize their server has a 5 hour queue at any time other than 3AM, some might consider ditching.
---
Someone goes for a food break or toilet break and DCs 2 hours into their planned 10+ hour stream? That could put them into a position where over half their stream is watching the queue tick down (or realistically, watching videos for hours) along with their viewer numbers.
---
I have that fucktard on ignore since that Asmogold drama.
---
Personally bro, I agree, I would re-sub in a heartbeat if they were to flag inactive accounts.  And I'm not going to re-sub just for a chance at it.  But it's only a beta, it's really not that big of a deal.
---
Oh you have to have a sub to get an invite? Serious question.
---
before the honor system, before the battlegrounds, i remember world pvp that we do against allys tarren mill to southshore back and forth, those were nice days, and i love ganking ppl in epl
---
This comment aged well
---
Wah waaaaah I have to re-sub... "A small price to pay for salvation."
---
Plus, streamers have themselves essentially become PvP objectives.
---
I see... This is the world where undead roam the world and no matter how many times i destroy the lord of the Blackrock Clan, he's alive again next week, right? 
---
The game where a beloved food dish turns you into a pirate?
---
Im still trying to understand where the disdain comes from in spite of all of the 'unrealistic' and 'cartoony' things that are accepted and given a pass.
---
Yeah, this drives me fucking nuts on my hunters on live.
---
how do most rogue fights start? one rogue catches the other one farming or herbing or something right? so the attacker already knows the victim is there, perception helps neither of the people in that situation because the victim has no idea the other is there and the attacker doesn't need it
---
perception is only good when one player already knows the other is around, which a good rogue won't let on unless they're ganking in a city or in a certain area of a bg, which if they're any good they will leave before anyone else shows up, it only lasts 20s so it can be avoided easily (it can't detect vanished players iirc) and then you can reopen on the person with it
---
catseye goggles, bloodvine lens, etc are better if you want to detect players consistenly without having to rely on a racial and an ability with a cooldown and a short duration
---
This guy gets it...
---
Man, it sucks. Started playing on the US servers since day 1 because I couldn't wait for it to be released in Europe. Even woke up at 4 am to raid haha. Switched over at januari 2016 to Europe.
---
&gt; OmniCC
---
Good call.
---
Nope.
---
It was always like that. Just shows how many people rather not pvp anymore.
---
They said wanted "as few as possible" so that they could all be sorted with layering to have a stable population when 90% of this subreddit quits the game after 2 months.
---
Damn some of these people have zero fucking lives. Really the most selected is 80+ hours? I’m not sure how people are able to play that much even if you take time off how is that fun. I’m going to be playing 10-19 hours an actually enjoy myself rather than swallowing my food without even chewing. Even if you took time off work spending your vacation playing 80+ hours just doesn’t seem very healthy at all.
---
It loads alot slower than imgur for me though.
---
Dank copypasta
---
you could have subbed in the time it took you to type all this.
---
give me a tldr. i finished university already. i dont read no moe
---
your post
---
I have one also from 2007 and everyday that goes by makes me want to sub even more... is it worth it 😭
---
While true, you don’t need to be a dick about it.
---
tldr; WHAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Good idea. 
---
I'll probably do that for the first two days of release but after that I'll have to leave the house and get a proper workout in.
---
Imo overpopulation is the only real problem along with world bosses.
---
But a minority of players will kill world bosses anyway, so it's not *that* big of a loss for a random person.
---
Overpopulation leads to queues and more extreme prices, because (I'm assuming here) supply won't scale as it does on private servers. There's only X amount of black lotus, and if more people than it is balanced around want flasks, prices go up.
---
Who wants a 3+ hour queue as they come home from work? Hell, there might even be real queues at off-hours on any megaserver.
---
You mean weeks per hour
---
??? No?? It was not always like that. Before, there was pvp servers. Everyone on the server agreed to pvp. Now there’s just warmode, and even a huge bonus for using it, and still people don’t want to fight.
---
Lol i just like the idea that I COULD not that I ever will. That's vanilla
---
Such a stupid stance. Hating vanilla WoW is fair, but hoping for classic servers to never run in parallel to the retail up to date WoW is just close minded. 2 things can coexist.
---
Wait wtf you're planning on playing 84 hours your first week WHILE working? If you play 16 hours on the 3 days you aren't working that's 48 hours. That's still 9 hours per day the other 4 days of the week after an 8 hour work shift. That's fucking insane.
---
I did. Didn’t tell me much
---
No worries! I really appreciate you taking the time to read through it. Reached out to you over disc (karenx) ^_^

He’s inspired  me to be a ret. I plan on boxing a ret fetal Druid with mass reflect and aoe dmg

Try again
---
They'll find a big server to make a name for themselves on during Classic. I seriously doubt they'll settle for anything but the highest of high pop servers. Well, queues aside.
---
watch there be as many realms for live as there are in beta...
---
It's been an issue for 3 years... there's absolutely a reason to be disappointed until they show they care about fixing it
---
I assume most people won't. I don't have a lot of ways to give Blizzard feedback so I took the time to write the post, but it would be nice if people were going to comment about the post that  they actually read it though.

Here's another instance of this concept: In Avengers they fight Thanos, they always refer to it as fighting Thanos. Even though most of their times they are fighting his servants. We say we're fighting Thanos though because he is the leader and the mastermind behind the attacks. 
---
Same concept here. They are leaders of their respective teams therefore we say Asmon vs Sony.
---
Sometimes it's just some nice background noise while you do something else and maybe you enjoy their personality, gameplay, community, or some combination of the 3. It's also a lot of the same reasons people like watching their friends play video games they're really into especially if someone doesn't really have too many or any friends then it becomes a very nice outlet for that person. It's a way to have some sort of parasocial connection with the streamer and/or find friends amongst the community of that streamer so they don't feel as alone even if for a little while.
---
Everyone agreed and realized hey PvE is better apparently because everyone ran to town and turned it off. They were just to poor to switch servers.
---
Lolwut. Horde has better quest rewards and levelling zones. 
---
Do you usually make up shit to try to fuel a bias towards your faction?
---
I read it.  I kept hoping to find fresh prince lyrics somewhere in there.  I am disappoint.
---
...? are you ok? what made you think my post was promoting communism?
---
I saw a tier breakdown of classes and specs in classic/vanilla, if you’re planning to raid the only viable warrior spec is prot because it’s simply the only good tank spec. However, anything except high pressure raising you will have fun playing any spec.
---
I'll also be looking to use the same character for world PvP.
---
Arms warrior was my favorite as a young'un in Vanilla, so I'm gravitating that direction, but I'd like to try new things.
---
Someone will guaranteed just make a character on every realm and /who them. Not a foolproof method, but a quick $2 donation saying "I see you're on Blackrock" is all it takes for a fake wide eyed, open mouth reaction I'd imagine.
---
Just asking around in game a lot of us are 2004 boys. Ive heard a few new players that got in but vast majority is 04 with some EARLY 05.
---
You think you do but you don't
---
definitely no shame in not getting one. if you have the time to invest as a Main Tank it’s an amazing role to play with or without the legendary sword.
---
There are like 2 realms for the beta, and only a limited number of influencers have access.
---
so yes, there will be way more realms.
---
I would say like maybe 10-15 for EU, and a few less for NA.
---
Not even close bruh...
---
love that you added in his 'loose gaggle' attack formation lol
---
i was dieing when he said that
---
and those are some epic last words, worthy of patton, alexander, hannibal, julius caesar, etc
---
&gt; They have Pally buffs, which heavily outclass shaman totems buffs 
---
gave some reasons in another comment, do you ignore actual points often to prove your point?
---
Why do you think the Vanilla players are pissed at the expansions?
---
So....you’re upset because? All I read was some entitled whining because “played blizz games forever imma vet!!” Do you have anything to actually be upset about here, or can we safely move on?
---
Rogue/warrior is your only option.
---
Yeah blizzard said only active subs will be considered.
---
Too many
---
Well there's only two to chose from really, fury warrior or combat rogue.
---
Congratulations to everyone that go a beta invite today, still no invite on my account but soon, hopefully.
---
Again Im only talking about duels and as a human rogue it helped a lot. Also at the start of bgs or even in open world if you see a stealthy coming from a distance you can easily predict when is a good time to use it. 
---
Also in duels, that’s like saying people are going to think you’re a dick for using vanish in a duel because it’s a class specific cd or using any racial, it’s there to be used. Blame blizzard. Also if it’s so useless why would they get mad about that?
---
I still have a few parked 19s. It was incredibly fun to min/max those characters, and hilarious (tragic) to watch my PvP buddy accidentally ding 20 by straying too far into unmarked territory. There was a lot of excitement to be had picking your gear and hoping like hell it dropped before you outpaced the bracket you wanted to get into.
---
south america next ofc
---
Fury warr is top melee dps on both factions once geared.
---
Nah stuff like this clogs the feed, due to laziness. It took the op longer to type his question than it did for me to google the topic and find the two viable vanilla specs for warrior.
---
iirc 4 pvp and 4 pve or 3/3
---
And $30 lunches, so basically a shit hole
---
I got banned from his channel because I have the name as on Twitch on my other reddit account. It was during the whole drama between him and Asmongold on r/wow. You can check what he wrote, it's definitely his most downvoted comment. And well, my answer was the most upvoted one with a a few reddit golds. You can guess what that fucking loser did. Not like I care, but some guy told me I probably got banned from his Twitch channel too. So I checked, altough I haven't watched him for like year, and boom, banned.
---
Just a reminder how huge loser that guy and his community are.
---
stop posting twitch clips you insufferable oaf
---
raider.io dosen't really work for classic simply since a server is too small of a sample size and playerbase to where you can make number demands.
---
if you doing group content at level 60 you will only have a handful of randos you can pick from a few will be removed since you put them on the ignore list since they were awful even if there gear was great. so you end up with somthing like 4-5 people you can pick. this is why you have a friends list in classic randos good enough to group with again.
---
the same holds true for raiding.
---
Windfury and horde racials are downright superior compared to some buffs that can literally be dispelled by Shamans LMAO
---
Why do you deserve it over those of us who have given blizz our $15/month since 2004/2005?
---
TLDR-  “ I didn’t get beta access, blizzard bad”
---
It's taken you almost a week to get to that loading screen. Think you need a new computer. Your etch a Sketch can't handle it.
---
newish to reddit posting. can I post an image as a response or just a link to the image?
---
&gt; Mountain King
---
That sounds sweet. Now I'm more curious about that one.
---
well, you pretty much only have warrior then.
---
You will miss those QoL changes, I tell you!
---
Kargoz's leveling guide is a great starting point: https://youtu.be/gtxX1WQILnM
---
Arms or Fury for leveling, Prot if you intend to do group content, especially in the endgame. It all comes down to playstyle and goals.
---
Nice find hopefully they remove this asap
---
Awwwww
---
so we are a shit hole for earning more because of strong economy?
---
Literally a developer with 1 year experience earn over 100k/year. How do I know? I earned that much 7 years ago.
---
right, but you could still have a few mins most likely if you're horde to go try gank I think. Would be iffy
---
So genius to see how many subs are registered and to alter their plans for server amounts.
---
Seriously why would a kid who didn't play an N64 and has his dad's credit card give a fuck about what gaming was in the old days
---
Yeah you should be good as long as you're subbed
---
6 of the absolute most essential add-ons to boot..
---
They haven't decided yet, but they're gonna start to figure that out once stress tests and name reservations happens.
---
technically 1 of each type per region is all that's needed
---
Wait is there any information on early character creation? I haven’t seen this posted here yet and I prob check way too often!
---
Because you said my post was cringe and, my post was about how smart it was for Esfand to merchandise the tabbard. I thought it was even better because it caught Asmond by surprise. He was sitting there like fuuuuuuk, why didn't I do that.
---
But I guess you were refering to the way I said what I said and, not the context of what I was talking about.
---
That's interesting. Was it behind a pay-wall? Lottery after opt-in? Open to all?
---
Dang. I feel like an asshole for not telling my friends that.
---
I don't understand, I thought it was funny and relatable, and since I rarely post on reddit, I apologize if I don't understand the meta on etiquette.
---
lmao now thats something I can read.
---
yeah I know, if you dont have active sub, you are not getting in, period
---
How about for PvP? Do Paladins get crapped on by mages, locks, hunters, and priests?
---
Well warrior is by far the best
---
But there will be a lot of them and obviously will be the most competitive to get gear with. 
---
If you're confident in your MMO abilities now. Go warrior
---
well if you pick racials for duels maybe you aren't the kind of person that needs to be helped
---
using an ability that all rogues have is not the same as using perception, it's just a courtesy, it's like using flare in a duel as a hunter against a rogue and standing inside it, kinda ruins the point of dueling
---
Be careful posting this. I posted last night and It get removed because the mods thought it wasn't about classic wow. I posted it as soon as it hit YouTube, but they thought it was private servers i guess? No brains! :/
---
&lt;Murloc Overlords&gt; \[Horde\] EU-Undecided Server Type
---
We are currently a group of friends that met up within WoW. Our guild was part of a larger guild that become corrupt, which led us to disband from it and go a different direction. Throughout all of us, we have people that started at BC and others at Legion. We are open to newcomers as I only joined at the end of WoD and have had minimal experience within private servers as well.
---
Our main goals are currently to just get a community of players to play throughout Classic and depending on the numbers, we can make additions to the guild like raid days/community events etc.
---
As of now, the server type that this will be played on is not decided, hopefully by the time that we have more players, we will be able to have a goal as a guild to partake in mainly PvP or PvE activities.
---
In general, this is not a hardcore guild, if that is what you are looking for, i would recommend going elsewhere. We are here to have fun and make some new friends during that period.
---
Here is our discord, feel free to join and talk to us about anything gaming related. [https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb](https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb)
---
If you have any questions about the guild, message me on reddit or join the discord and send me a PM from there (I am Cattman312 on discord)
---
I hope to talk with you soon, and if not, i hope that you find what you are looking for in the rest of this page.
---
Those were most likely content creators or "influencers" 
---
If you're hand picked, you don't need a sub, if you want a chance at the raffle, you *must* be subbed.
---
&gt;Do you usually make up shit to try to fuel your bias towards your faction?
---
Name checks out
---
I doubt that your case is any more than a corner case. It just wouldn’t make sense to move to an upfront model because then there would be micro transactions involved. If you think you’re ever getting an mmo without micro transactions or a subscription fee or both, you’re just not living in 2019.
---
gametime = sub.
---
You will be good for the next 10 days
---
Retail bad
---
Aren't Fury DPS warriors top tier and there are usually more DPS warriors in a raid than Prot warriors?
---
I watch BFA streamers like Jdot or Max from Limit. Basically just streams that are doing the most competitive stuff in WoW. Can't really see much people watching regular shit in BFA
---
your post was cringe and i indeed put it in my cringe compilation, sorry that i had to do this to you, but that's the way she goes
---
And it took you even longer to type out what you said. Ignore it and move on or contribute. You don’t have to acknowledge all the things that upset you, you know.
---
Here is one of the few screenshots I still have from back then. https://imgur.com/a/EiSwnK3 
---
Taken when my guild was trying to clear AQ40. Kinda late into vanilla so I guess my resolution wasn't that bad at that point.
---
I think three months is enough time to let some of the over-hype to die down.
---
The best spec for war is tank and the best race is orc or human.
---
Keep telling yourself that so you don't feel like a pleb. Luckily for you, there's a lot more plebs than there are decent players. hehe
---
Well, I have a second monitor (love a second monitor), but I have not seen this vertical setup until people started posting their battle-stations. I guess it makes sense for mobile-optimized websites (read: world) ... but as someone who HATES vertical video (I work in advertising), not sure why you'd gimp your PC layout haha. It looks interesting to me!
---
the clock is ticking my guy. 10 days hype! I'm rooting for you!
---
really?  eh not me, I was just like "oh....ok...shrug" about it.....I mean it wasn't high really any high level game play or anything, which is most of what I like out of streams, so that's probably why it was a miss for me.
---
“army of gurgling ass holes comes to run you down..”
---
Pretty sure I still have PTSD from this
---
Got it! Thanks. I'll keep refreshing the launcher for now.
---
oh yeah, they changed it with the 2nd mount patch. still, for the majority of vanilla they could only ride kodos.
---
👌🏻
---
I need Blizzard to titanforge my will to live with beta access. Kappa
---
I think most servers will be high pop anyway as there will be layering instead of a million servers.
---
Not sure, never did it. Buff duration isn't long enough to warrant doing that consistently.
---
I mean I think I can live with some random kid on the internet calling my post cringe. Especially when his name is D0pe_sp0t lol.
---
I did read it, it’s just silly. Closed beta is not an open door for you to walk through.

1) No one owes anything to you, you don't have any kind of obligation to get a closed beta invite
---
2) You can still get a beta invite if you aren't subbed, you just need to sub to log in
---
3) No shit they are trying to up their sub numbers since they've been plummeting through BFA, why is this even a surprise
---
4) If you don't like it don't play
---
5) It's a CLOSED beta; this is some of the biggest whinging out of anyone on this sub
---
6) The game is coming out in like 3 months, what's the issue here, just wait for the actual game
---
7) If you want to play that bad just go on a private server for the interim
---
Take your pick I couldn't decide which one to post so I just listed all my thoughts about your rant.
---
I don’t know how the first pull in ZG would go if this isn’t fixed
---
Sorry man, nothing you say now can get you out of my cringe compilation, again, I'm sorry it had to be this way.
---
&gt; That's fucking insane.
---
I never got to play classic, even though i bought it on release (no credit card access) I wont miss my chance again
---
Then you dont know Asmon, He did ironman without handouts. He will get to the epic mount without it. Stop bashing just to bash.
---
🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Good. Why should you get to test classic when you don’t even contribute to it being made? Just roll on a private sever since you’re poor.
---
You dont get 100k+ viewers if your not likeable. Maybe you dont, but people clearly do.
---
[https://imgur.com/sndSIbN](https://imgur.com/sndSIbN) either way...this is mine :)
---
Depending on how long you and I have to wait for real invites, Blizzard historically does not send beta invite waves on weekends so you don't need to bother checking it 100 times daily like I know I do on week days.
---
Aren't they still Aggressive, Defensive and Passive?
---
I remember running over to the games section of my local country ass Wal-Mart and doing the exact same thing lol.
---
Finally got dial up internet and this is the first thing I bought!
---
I assume it’s just people who don’t know what they are getting into.
---
Can't winem all lol. Send me the link if I get a lot of updoots on r/cringe assuming thats a thing.
---
Only works for trolls mom.. Not gnomes.
---
So why haven’t you contributed other than white knighting the op? 
---
Exactly, you understand that laziness is an issue. You feel as if I handled this in not the best way and hope to enlighten me to the shiny and chrome ways of peace and understanding. 
---
I commend your tact, I have none and will most likely never have it.
---
Has anyone in beta tested out whether swimming up the coast from Menethil Harbor and drowning in that pocket that lets you rez in dwarf starting zone works?
---
We will be looking out for you!
---
While leveling paladins are amazingly strong in wpvp because of all the defensive options.  Bubble, BoP for allies, and lay on hands are crazy cooldowns and you can use 2 or even 3 of them in a fight.  Pal kind of struggle to do damage at times but with a friend you can focus on supporting THEM to do damage and healing / autoattack or judgment when you can.  
---
In a 1v1 fight paladins will get owned by warlocks.  Priests are a tough matchup but more of a stalemate, same with mages.  Hunters are basically gods of wpvp all the way to 60 so good luck with that.  It all changes if you're in a group though, paladin + friend is a great PVP tandem no matter who the other class is.
---
Gawd, please stop adding to the list.
---
At this point we need like 200+ servers to have servers without streamers.
---
I hope that [dungeon.io](https://dungeon.io) crap is a troll as well.
---
Did you try searching for the word '[wine](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpub25/test_results_linux_wine_flawless/)' on the forum?
---
i think is a streamer thing they can see their chat better this way
---
This pretty much right here.
---
The interview was basically a chance for classic devs to low-key rip on modern WoW. Demon Hunters were already considered to be a thing in WoW along with others.
---
You could write it in the official forums. I’m sure it’ll be well received.
---
oh boy! cant wait to get home to be certain i didnt got in!
---
Im glad bgs come one phase after honor system is released
---
Sco manages just fine to keep his cool and awesome person with 300 or 150k viewers. So why not?
---
&gt; a /who doesn't tell you if it is the right guy or a copycat
---
it does when their race, class, zone, level, and guild all match.  Even if someone did create a copycat character and mirror the streamer in every way, a simple party invite would make a popup on the stream.
---
Great memories. Going out 11PM to grab a copy at midnight. They installing of multiple discs was a pain but also part of the experience.
---
Yeah, they can't keep it under wraps forever but just due to people trying to steal their names there will be as many of that name as there are servers. I would guess a day or so at max before people start checking the names of people they run into and narrowing it down.
---
orc lock bbgril
---
I'm part of the group who felt like vanilla was kinda shitty, but if classic wow can get enough popularity long term for them to redo TBC and WOTLK, by god i will gladly play through vanilla for that
---
This.  This right here.  There is little to no evidence that would show millions of people coming back in droves to play Classic.  There are barely 100k subs here.  The number has been steadily going up according to the stats they put out about it, i get that, but the important number I think would be the 800,000 unique visitors in May so far.  Everyone thinks multiple millions of people are coming back, but what those millions of people aren't doing, is watching classic videos on youtube, watching streams, subbing to the classic reddit.  This game is sooooooo HYPED but you're trying to tell me that millions of people simply aren't doing anything in anticipation for the game?  I find that very hard to believe.  If 5-8 million people were going to sub to this game Blizzard would have released the game yesterday.  They would make 1-1.5 billion dollars with that many new subs over a year.  This is just a simple and easy cash grab.    There is going to be a surge in the beginning and then its going to thin out to the actual population that will be playing for an extended period of time.  Its not going to be over 1 million after a year in my opinion.  I would guess somewhere between 500-750k after one year.  I hope I'm wrong.  I really do.  I want classic to be successful, as I would really enjoy it if they continued to BC specifically, maaaaybe WotLK, anything besides just letting Classic run its course and then its done, but they only way that is going to happen is if Classic is wildly successful.  While it might be a lot of fun, if its not making Blizzard a load of money were probably not going to see anything come after it.
---
It already moved forward with TBC. There is 0% chance they would develop new level 60 content instead of creating Legacy TBC servers on the foundation of WoW Classic. Its wishful thinking at best.
---
Well, which expansion will they make new content for? Because I would want new classic content.
---
The issue is that some might keep it secret until they are discovered. Imagine leveling up to 30, getting all your friends to 30, and then finding out you have Asmon on your server. Fuck me....
---
I resubbed the day of the first wave of invites and got an invite with the 2nd batch that came the following evening.  My account was created 11-24-2004 for reference
---
what is this over-hype you speak of
---
If you're unsure, go alliance. Where the push-overs belong.
---
You can be in denial, it's ok. People can like things you dont like too, you know?
---
You give me hope
---
Sorry buddy, this is a personal cringe compilation, the likes of which will not be posted on r/cringe it is for the personal amusement of me and my comrades
---
Sure, someone will figure it out eventually, but they aren't about to announce beforehand and by the time it's figured out I would hopefully have started somewhere already.
---
Sonii's speech at the end was fucking hype as shit
---
Hybrid for healing and melee till 60 then flop to full heals or full windfury slamma
---
That wouldn't make any sense
---
Hopefully it could get to the point where we have counter guilds created that just grief big time annoying streamers.
---
The monitor is on the right. I use a 65 inch tv for Twitch. The right monitor is strictly for text,databases and discord. I have never had neck problems.

Name TBD:

Horde PvE focused SEMI hardcore raiding guild.We will be rolling on a PvP server for launch.  We are based in the Central USA timezone. 
---
Laid back but competitive enviroment. We might not be server first but we will certainly push for it and we wont be far behind. SENSE OF HUMOR REQUIRED. Leadership has cleared content thru Naxx in vanilla. Join now to have input on guild name and raiding schedule. Accepting all roles and classes. Leaning towards a democratic loot council system with core officers (founding leadership) and elected class officers. Class officers will be elected by the core raiders of their class. There will be a total of 40 core members who will be guaranteed raid spots who vote for leadership. Core member slots will go to the 40 members who make it to the first MC run. To maintain core member status you must attend 80% of schedulded raid content as well as being geared &amp; consumable prepaired. Elections will be held the week after entering MC the first time and every 3-4 months after that. There will be a system of checks and balances to stave off corruption and provide transparency. We want to clear all content in a timely manner while having fun. That being said having fun is not wiping 17 times on trival content so don't expect the raid to be filled with boomkins &amp; enhance shammies.
---
If this sounds like your cup of tea jump into our discord and start getting to know the guys. https://discord.gg/nFt3qqj
---
You should play whatever you want.   
---
Since there is no arena, you don't need to min-max for pvp.  
---
Raids can be cleared even with sub-optimal races easily.  
---
Racials do have big benefits but I feel like every race, class and spec has a place in the game and you can't really go wrong.  
---
If you want to min-max sure but not even the most try-hard players will reject you based on your race.
---
true fans of classic can not be subbed to WoW currently so this does not make sense at all.
---
it might very well be the most boring thing they have ever added to the game.
---
thats when i started sadly not on this wave, but the fact we are seeing a lot of EU gives me hope
---
I really wish they realese tbc in 2020 and then realese woltk in 2021  .. :p
---
Seconded.
---
You've things backwards, BfA is the trash you get for free when subbing to classic.
---
Whats failing in this is people not remembering how hard was to keep gold at 60. Between repairs,consumables,enchants and so on , you will have to grind for gold. 
---
People who are giving gold to streamers right now either are doing that because its beta or because they dont know whats coming for them at max level.
---
So yhea..some might still give him gold but nothing compared to what happen in bfa
---
Correct, both fury and prot are viable raid specs.
---
Exactly. This "but they started it!" excuse is childish. If the point of Classic WoW is to have a supportive MMO community where you actually have to work together, why is it the complete opposite on the forums, and people make enemies out of people for being fans of a slightly different game in the same series.
---
The thing is it's like - why would you invite inactive accounts to play a beta for a game? You have no proof they'll actually test it anyway.. I assume this is the reason behind their decision in the first place.
---
That, along with the fact Classic fans still clinging on to BFA really are resilient and would be useful in the beta.
---
Just a thought!
---
Glad to know I wasn't the only one.
---
Coolstorybro
---
Enjoy the $30 lunches LULW
---
based
---
Don't get me wrong I think Kara is awesome, I ran it very close to every week of the expansion, sometimes twice while I was leading a raiding guild, we had a blast doing it.  
---
My issues is the idea it's popularity meant people wanted 10 man content, maybe it did, but when you make something mandatory which it was, and then say, well people did this more than anything else so it must be the right path, that is terrible logic.
---
For sure people can like different things. I never said they couldn't. All I said is the majority of people will not stay on it. A few hundred thousand maybe might stay on classic. But the mass majority will stay with retail
---
One of my favourite things - the community on a server.
---
When I was about 12 the guild I was in disbanded, and I was very upset. I remember crying on ventrillo after realizing it wasn't a glitch that my guild wasn't showing up. A couple years after that I jumped back on my character and was walking around Org. A random person came up to me and started chatting. It turned out they were a former guildy on their alt. We caught up and they told me I was the inspiration for them creating their mage they were playing now. (i played a mage)
---
It was a really nice moment at 12 years old, being able to inspire someone. I have so many cherished memories like that one! I am looking forward to trying it out again with family and friends.
---
It's surely possible, but when you question someone else saying "I plan on playing 9 to 12 hours a day." with "that's it!?! I'm playing 16 hours a day, plus 9 on days I work." the accused might not be the weird one.
---
Will never not love Tauren Hunter, my first main
---
I'm gonna need to re-watch that episode the day before launch as my final hype piece.
---
I did this yesterday after watching the battle of Arathi. Here's to hoping!
---
Why do you hurt me :(
---
Fury brings the highest DPS in the game through all tiers... so how are you figuring the only viable warrior spec to be prot?
---
Would love for pfquest to find it's way to classic, was much better than quests imo
---
Weird, I played BFA and my last payment it has was in 2017.. hmm..
---
yeah especially considering not everyone gets invited to beta. I'm not subbed to WoW Bfa cause it sucks ass, and I'm not gonna pay a sub just for a chance to play in the beta for a bit so I'm waiting for release to actually re-sub up.
---
Would be mad butthurt if everyone is maxxed out cause they played beta first and I'm already behind on day 1.
---
You'd be in the same group, therefore have the same tag. This is an issue for people that aren't grouped
---
I've played a prot warrior since late vanilla and i have to say it's the best if you plan on raiding. You can make a group for a dungeon so easily because everyone needs a tank if you become the main tank for your guild you're guaranteed a raid spot all the time and you get all the best loot. Downside is it kinda sucks for pvp and of course leveling as a warrior is painfully slow and difficult compared to mage/hunter but in my opinion it pays off in the end and is well worth the grind.
---
I think they are Assist, Defensive and Passive. Difference is that Assist will make the pet attack when you attack, while defensive only makes them attack if you're hurt. Or at least that's how it works for me.
---
While the new defense has it's uses, I prefer the old system. Aggressive is great when you're waiting for mobs to spawn and the old defense was way better as an all-round.
---
I mean this sub started parroting the "haters" to justify layering
---
Oh my a genuine legolas! Enjoy dude. I am considering voting for going alliance, mostly for the fresh experience. I would miss horde questing, shaman and faction spirit, but i do see the alliance appeal 2 in paladins and lore - and the freshness. I played a little bit of ally in other expansions but never dominantly. Making me wonder now, you guys recruiting? You said it was a chill guild?
---
It's not you, it's him.
---
&gt; or hope the stress test is open for inactive accounts.
---
Hint: It won't be.
---
There definitely are some etiquette things that some new people might need to know but to keep people in the spirit of classic/vanilla,  the best thing is to just let people you group with know ahead of time how you roll (literally). We want people to play forever in classic and don't want to scare the new people away.
---
&gt; we were just fucking terrible
---
pretty accurate
---
Some guy above said he subbed with gold so
---
Honestly, I think Blizzard is right on this one. The beta being restricted to active subs makes total sense, because it means that those who get the beta are playing the game on a regular basis and the company can be sure to get feedback from these people. How would they know you want to and would even play the beta if you aren't subscribed? How can they trust you to give them the necessary feedback? Sure, you may have tagged yourself as interested in testing Classic Beta, but this is also kind of a gift from Blizzard to those who are still invested in their game, which seems like an appropriate priviledge. Streamers were obviously chosen in order to give free publicity for the game, so they could be excused from this sub requirement.
---
Blizzard is, of course, making money out of all this, but imo they are right to require a sub
---
Hybrid as in ele+resto with dagger/shield?
---
currently subbed?
---
Why can’t people understand that this is a beta TEST and not early access. I get it, I’m eager to get in too but the whole point of beta is not a free ride.
---
Lies
---
Layering can’t do anything to stop 60k people from trying to login.
---
I'm so happy for you guys. Finally more and more people are getting in and not only streamers.
---
Just checked my email and didn't get anything so don't forget to post some screenshots/first feelings for those of us who are unlucky.
---
I'm not sure how it works tho. Because I have two emails, the first one is old as fuck, I don't use it that much anymore. Just checked and the first time I created a battle.net account connected to this email was in 2006 when I started playing WoW. However I haven't logged into this account literally for years. I got this account stolen at some point (yes I was a naive kiddo back then), I got it back but I haven't used it since then.
---
Then I have a second email connected to bnet account. Both are newer than the first ones. However I've been subbed to WoW on this account for so many years now, but this account isn't from vanilla. Hell I'm still subbed and play BfA like once per week. 
---
So I'm curious if they're sending those invites based on that if you were registered during vanilla or not, because I'm not buying another sub for years inactive bnet account just for a slight chance to get in. I have everything on the newer account, games, authentificator. Anyone with bnet account that wasn't active during vanilla got in?
---
*intern
---
Not saying you didn't, just helping...
---
Try and repeat bugs 5 times.  I.E. get that warrior to tag 5 mobs, and try to polymorph all 5.  
---
Give exact steps to recreate (this one is pretty obvious in this situation, but sometimes its detailed steps)
---
Be clear **and** concise when describing bug reports!
---
You barely have to scroll when browsing in 16:10 format if vertical. Text documents fits more text .less time scrolling through your leveling plan, faster leveling ;)
---
Open the door, get on the floor!  Everybody walk the dinosaur!
---
You're being too reasonable for this subreddit bro

I am pretty sure a lot of the xroads raids stemmed from Alliance needing to get alts from WC then the 60 mains being there already

History:  I played vanilla back when wow first came out, I raided on an alliance  warrior up to naxx 40. Didn't get a chance to do it then. I played on nostalrius til it was shut down, didn't really raid then. Just played a  dwarf priest to 60. Also play retail off and on and raid
---
Was that a paladin that rolled / won the roll on them?
---
im not sure how im weird if i am managing to go to work, get full nights of sleep and play 72 hours (i just did the math)
---
Taking off a full week of work implies you are going to make the most use of the launch week, Id expect more since you would have more free time

did not read
---
Thats a really good point actually. I know a lot of people just want to be on his stream for a second, or they want to "contribute to the cause" or whatever, but I imagine people might be willing to contribute far less since it takes far more to earn a good income.
---
Tons of nickel and dime costs, respecs, consumables, yadada. 
---
10/10 great point
---
Pathetic.
---
&gt;Ooo a chest! WAIT DON'T OPEN THAT! Everyone /roll to see who wins the chest.
---
does it work this way in vanilla? I thought it rolled out the items if they were green or better once the chest is opened and then theres just food and stuff inside
---
Why would you ever play undead warrior?
---
They are garbage, Orc has the best racials in the game overall, and Taurens have like 5% extra HP.
---
and warriors already have a break for fear (and sleep?)
---
Truly words of someone who doesnt know how economy works.
---
I want to marry the OP &lt;3
---
OMG I'm so jealous. 
---
I want to play!!!!!! 
---
Let me In!!!! 
---
Let me in!!!!! 
---
I would pay good money for a beta invite. 
---
You hear me blizzard, MONEY. I have money, take my money.
---
How else would you know you were in Winterspring?
---
The character you, for whatever reason, is putting the most effort into at the moment.
---
I thought the Method guys said they weren't going to play classic
---
then you had to d/l patches (assuming it wasn't 1.0) and install them lol
---
What a fucking twat
---
Hi, /u/FireConsumes
---
The opposite of an alt
---
Been watching since he had about 1500 viewers. When he has something to gain, he'll do it. Ironman is not something he will gain from.
---
Maybe Frost, but I’d love to play with Frost. Dude is relaxed and chill.
---
Happens on live too when your level is below the ilevel for the goggles. Hopefully they fix two birds with one stone lol.
---
A third monitor might be a bad idea yeah.
---
Give it a 5 or 6 year development cycle. Most MMOs start going downhill after about 5 years so it feels like a good timeframe to be able to advance to the next thing in good time.
---
Enhancement is the minimal down time spec, its the most efficient for leveling. Your heals will be just as helpful in a duo situation regardless of your spec. 
---
Elemental is fun, especially 40+, but you go oom really fast and you have a lot of drinking down time. 
---
You can heal dungeons as any spec as long as you have some healing gear. Some people like to respec somewhere between 50-60 so they can get used to the resto/holy spec.
---
Because they look awesome? Not everyone min/maxes race.
---
Hi, /u/Vrancken
---
He also calls modern WoW "Retail" which is dumb because classic wow is retail too.
---
They aren’t going to announce them. They’ll probably try their hardest to cover their game name during launch.
---
Yeah is BIS for like everyone
---
I played wow from classic through Lich, is this a paid  for thing or can I roll back to the classic wow I paid for years ago
---
I twinked a 19 rogue for a little bit and got pretty bored with the limited amount of abilities, ended up doing a slightly tinked 39 and had a much, much, much more fun time with it.
---
I don’t understand why anybody gives a shit about this stuff. Funny how butthurt these people are and then they try turning it around on you
---
In my opinion, actually finding you a group wasn't the problem with lfg/r.
---
Teleporting you to the raid and cross realm(so you may never encounter the members again) aspects of it killed the sense of a local world.
---
Ah okay, so tail end of TBC.  Interesting.
---
Yeah, VuhDo has lots of fiddly bits you can/need to set up. I can completely understand everyone who's happy with just Grid + Clique and doesn't want to bother.
---
VuhDo just has some nifty little features I really like, which is why it's my favorite raidframe/healing addon.
---
I would never play videos on my second screen. Strictly text,chat monitor
---
Lucky jerks 😄😄😀
---
I don’t think there was any paywall. I think it was a closed beta followed by an open beta.  I remember when I joined I had to get a code from someone else in my Corp but later on that may not have been true.  
---
Unrelated it was a huge cluster fuck.  They had to keep adding more servers and there was no que to log in so you just had to attempt to log in over and over until successful.  Once the game launched and you had to pay for it all but 3 servers were never that busy again.  A great example of the reach of a free game vs a box cost and monthly fee.
---
Lol what is life when i get to play classic
---
o hai Mark
---
I too want to play in the Beta but will not pay for a Sub for the chance.
---
I believe it's a bad business practice &amp; I won't support it. So I'll wait for live. Will I make a difference? Of course not. But when companies, video game related or otherwise, do something I don't agree with, I'll speak with my wallet. If enough people do that, sometimes something might happen. Classic will be so big it's not going to matter here, but it still matters to me.
---
The fact you have to opt-in on the website to Classic to be available for the beta should have eliminated the worry about potentially giving the beta to inactive accounts. So that's a cop-out. This is a cash grab, straight up. Just like the bullshit about being able to reserve a name early.
---
Maybe when I get home from work tomorrow :) 
---
Made my account on February 2007 :D
---
Its neets or professional streamers
---
So now we're just cutting the gnome out entirely?
---
Yeah, I know how faulty memory can be, but I'm at the end of my rope for this.  I was thinking all of that too, which is why I just got frustrated, lol.  Stuff's just not making sense. At this point, I've practically given up because I feel like we've exhausted all ways to figure this out, sorry to say.
---
How you can tell its vanilla: there are people in the raid with names like nexus and bum which weren't already taken years ago.
---
PAYO OR DIE
---
This need to be upped..
---
TFW subbed on both EU and NA and yet to get in
---
You can but it takes 40 minutes of the entire raid literally doing nothing.
---
Asmongold did it on his stream and had a transmog contest. They finished before the WF lost
---
Use those 255 characters wisely!
---
Enjoy your overpriced freedomless lunch
---
Yeah but when the cap gets increased?
---
This makes a lot of sense!
---
You could grief people by dueling them and /forfeit and /pvp right before the duel starts, but aoeing next to somebody that's flagged will not flag you in a non contested zone.
---
Things like Buffing friendly flagged players will flag you.
---
i think part of it is he wants to be able to actually play the game, and not have a raid forming against him everytime he tries to do a quest or enter a dungeon.
---
Then don't join the beta you whining nerd.  They clearly have more willing beta testers than they need already.
---
It is recommended you level as enhance till 40, then switch to elemental till 60. You can heal dungeons as any spec while you level. Being resto while leveing would be a waste.
---
At 60 you can normally get away with being a ele/resto hyrbid spec. Almost no guilds will force you into full resto. If your guild trys to they better be top tier or tell them to fuck off and take your beautiful totems elsewhere.
---
Right. If I get a third monitor, I might try it!
---
Reeeeeee normie
---
I'm so sad. My account is from 2010 so there is absolutely no way that I'm getting an invite :(
---
wow that was freaking epic, the guy got an item! Oh my god!
---
You mustn't have seen me mention my parses, anyone who does any sort of high end content looks at their parses for improvement, I wasnt doing M+ because I was raiding, anyone with half a fucking brain can go and do a bunch of 7-10s and get a semi decent I.O Score, I just wasnt doing them.
---
Just gotta pick your battles dude. Most of the time it’s just not worth the energy. 
---
Yes I am also aware that my advice fully applies to me, I just don’t understand why it’s so common to see people jump to aggression over trivial stuff like this.
---
&lt;Sorry&gt; | NA | PvP | Alliance | EST/CST
---
Introduction:
---
On behalf of all guild members, I would just like to say to the horde, we're sorry... Sorry... is a group of close friends and family. We have all experienced Classic WoW, and are excited to have it back. We appreciate a good community, and are looking for players we can get to know and trust. With any MMO we understand max level is just the beginning, but RL is more important to us this time around. With that in mind, we still want to experience ALL aspects from this great game.
---
Goal:
---
Sorry is looking to form a tight group of players before the launch.  We really want to get some fun premade BGs going, but know we will need PvE gear to excel in PvP. Therefore, we expect to run many preraid dungeons to acquire everything we need for raids. We are determined to see all content Classic has to offer - we'll do what it takes!
---
Raid Times:
---
TBD
---
Classes Needed:
---
We are taking anyone interested at this time!
---
https://discord.gg/9jENjfM
---
Goddamn I'm so excited for this again.
---
Currently in bfa due to all the time gates and it being just straight dog shit i don't have a main anymore i just play what ever i feel
---
Female Troll + any class. If they could be Druids,  I wouldn't have to roll Alliance lol.
---
Just saying, there are lots of things that vanilla is going to benefit from now; such as enhanced stability of the overall game. Classic wow is similar to OSRS in the fact that it’s going to be a recreation of “old” WoW, but if you’ve ever seen or played OSRS, it’s not old RS anymore. The population eventually wanted changes and updates, and now OSRS is pretty different from what it used to be.
---
&gt; Streamers were obviously chosen in order to give free publicity for the game
---
Also, they probably figured streamers would 100% get in anyways, because their hordes of followers would gladly give them use of at least one account, so they may as well make it above-board and get the publicity out of it.
---
I'm pretty sure I had queues longer 6k in vanilla.
---
warrior has the highest hp regen coefficient from spirit at .8, almost 10x some classes
---
"""influencers"""
---
Interesting, activated my account two days ago, hoping I would get invited. And I’m invited now! Activated the subscription of the account I used back in the day, not sure if that has anything to do with it, or it being pure luck.
---
It means that Method as a team doesn't care about it. Some of the members will play it but Method doesn't care about world first in content that is going to fall over as soon as it launches.
---
No they are not
---
Exactly. Thought that was pretty obvious from the statement. Saying i got the shit enchant cause i couldn't afford the good one. @mez
---
I believe on the beta server you can make characters of any faction because there is only one server.
---
which of your accounts was active? I got a 2008 active account and a May 2005 inactive.
---
oh dont worry, day one of game release you had to install patches.
---
I couldnt log in til the third day because my dial-up was so dang slow to download them
---
Had a friend who was legit in the best guild on our server and their #1 mage get passed on because he had bad I.O, it doesnt mean shit 90% of the time.
---
HAHAHA, i got in. resubbed yesterday thinking i must have a relatively high chance since i played on day one.
---
yees! cant wait to get home tomorrow :D (and then come home again)
---
Tauren Shaman, you look like a god damn monster. Nothing feels more bad ass then warstomping and chucking chain lighting out like some bovine god.
---
The list of unwritten rules can be made long, so I’ll just add this to the OP; 
---
Let the people you group with know that this is your first time playing vanilla (or doing a certain dungeon) and they will guide and help you. And if you make a mistake they’ll understand.
---
He was given at-least 10 gold by viewers in the 30 mins I watched.
---
People say this, but....inspecting gear always have a better view overall of what someone has accomplished, so I’m not sure how that affects much?
---
Roll enhancement in the beginning. Will allow you to both kill mobs quickly. You can still heal low level instances in any spec. Just keep a secondary int. healing set. As another person said between 50-60 you can respect to full resto. Later dungeons are harder to heal. You will need the healing talents to get your pre-bis gear. Life at 60 will be raiding as heals. Pvp as Ele or Resto. Then the famouns meme enhancement specs.
---
Staying hydrated for the grind. This guy knows it.
---
This is such a non issue it's insane. I know you all hate blizzard and I get it they've sucked recently. But maybe, since they have a relatively few amount of slots they are going to give out, doesn't seem crazy to reward the people paying for your product. I don't see how that's crazy, you are not owed an invite in any way
---
What purpose would lying about that serve, though?
---
Ye, call them that to piss them off.
---
fucking influencers
---
Do we even know how many players BFA has? I thought Blizzard stopepd reporting subscriber numbers.
---
Wish we had new models too...
---
I was a "no changes" mechanically guy. I don't care if classic uses graphics from the 2030 retail client.
---
It's only better.
---
What drawings?
---
this sounds like a post from someone who played on a PvE server lol
---
Thanks for writing.  Skipped straight to the comments to laugh at you with everyone else.
---
Daily reminder that people who orbit streamers most likely won't hit 60 anyways.
---
what else do they prefer to be called then? valuable human beings?
---
Asmongold is a fucking scumbag. I cannot believe people enjoy watching him and even idolize him. He seems easily upset and butthurt about the smallest things, he's selfish as fuck, and his ego is enormous (gimmie gimmie gimmie!). I feel bad for the guy leveling with him on the beta who actually seems like a pretty chill dude (Esfand), because Asmongold is constantly getting agitated towards him, trying to socially dominate him, and basically treating him like his little bitch... it's disgusting.
---
I know other EU streamers are still planning on playing on NA servers in order to group with the bigger streamers, maybe he will too.
---
That would imply both games are equal!
---
When classic wow has more subs. It will most likely be used as the pivot to develop future content. The bloat on the modern game is out of control and is much harder for Blizzard to manage. Classic passing retail would be the biggest gift any mmo company has ever received. Blizz would take it happily.
---
Just go full +int/spirit till 40, then elemental. 
---
Warriors notoriously roll on 2handers, 1handers, shields, leather/mail/plate melee gear like  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=10774](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10774)  because stats &gt; armor especially when playing with a healing buddy who can gloss over 5-10% more damage taken. Going int + spirit ensures you always have mana to chuck a heal on your aggro holding warrior friend and you dont compete with your warrior pal for gear.
---
He will go arms and 2-5points into tac mastery, so even if you pull aggro sometimes he can just taunt without losing rage. 
---
At level 39 elemental becomes a doom machine 3shotting any opposing player with LB -&gt; elemental mastery CL -&gt; shock
---
Banner from amazon, canvas from redbubble. ;)
---
11. If you decide to roll a rogue, ABJ...  Always. Be. Jumpin'.
---
What the chunk 
---
Why did my 2006 account not get in :(
---
Are we actually believing that?
---
I'm fully prepared to be reported or suspended for griefing with Mind Control but idc, its fun as hell to Shadowmeld and just wait to make someone jump into some lava or off the zepplin/boat/whatever. 
---
I enjoy forcing a minor inconvenience on the enemy faction, more than I do actually killing them in a way that says "I'm better at PvP than you".
---
they just report active players across all games on battlenet
---
But, the argument you’re using is simply because blizzard created it like that, they could have just as easily made flowing armor combinations that actually looked good together. So, in an alternate timeline, Blizzard could have made the random gear overall make sense instead of what we have today, no?
---
Hello!  
---
We've figured out that there is an issue with Stoneskin Totem. Basically, it isn't correctly removing its melee damage reduction when it expires. We've seen in examples given where the player had previously grouped with a Shaman, and carried forward the effects of the totem.  
---
We're fixing this, and the fix will be in the next build of WoW Classic. We'll put it into our Known Issues list until then.  
---
There always was some IF music in the SM armory.
---
classic gets updates.
---
retail gets more MTX.
---
Why should anyone care?  Hell Blizzard probably won't even care if they can get people to pay for old content without having to make new content.
---
On the beta you can't reset instances and port back to the instance entrance.
---
Before they released the beta they added an option to opt into the classic wow beta.
---
I don't think it would mean anything for BFA. Even if more people played Classic, there would still be a huge amount of people playing and paying for BFA. Changing modern WoW to be much more like Classic would just piss all those people off, and all the people that want to play Classic are just paying Classic, so yeah BFA and the next WoW xpack won't change much at all really.  
---
The main question is what it would mean for Classic if it is successful enough to warrant putting a full dev team on it. If Classic is mega successful and gets 4 mil subs or something crazy (it won't, but this is your hypothetical..) then the question of what's next becomes very real. You want to keep those 4 mil subs and you don't do that by just sitting back and doing nothing after naxx.
---
How do you get 84 hours in one week only taking one day off?
---
All they had to do was make it a big pvp brawl with the factions pushing their lanes and capturing points to kill the enemies npc commander. 
---
And it would have been awesome. Thats all they had to fucking do.
---
Fuck yeah they do look awesome. And your min maxing haters tears will be tasty when youre canniblizing their dead bodies
---
In my experience playing planetside 2, total biscuit was on my server on the red faction and they dominated the game due to sheer numbers. A small group of experienced PvPers can definitely go a long way, but the general faction Balance of the server will be thrown off completely.
---
Some? Basically all. I didn't upgrade to 1080 until WotLK, because the price had gone down so much by then.
---
It’s still more than just people who have played vanilla right? I agree they should have invited other people as well but I my point is clear I guess from what I’ve said earlier.
---
"implied drug use is against ToS"  
---
\*kids literally getting their characters drunk in game: mother approved\*
---
It's not unreasonable when you consider blizzard has been (at that time) very explicit about the low/no return on investment from resurrecting vanilla wow.
---
They are being hypocritical.
---
You do realize MMO subscriptions are to pay for the data your character(s) takes up as well as to pay for the developer upkeep, right? 
---
Just because the game is old, doesn't mean it doesn't cost any money to maintain...
---
Grandma take your medicine
---
Top of Ironforge with the airstrip? Gonna try that tonight when I get home!
---
Degaussing....I still miss degaussing.
---
Agreed. Nothing feels better then helping someone blow threw a new dungeon and have a good time in the process. We all were green at some point.
---
Your main is whatever you declare it to be.  Don’t think there is a set definition.  Now if you have a bunch of 60’s and you declare some level 1 char that you’ve never played your main, then you’re just trolling.
---
I don't think "a lot" means what you think it means.
---
Yes, everyone opted in has a chance to get it
---
enh+resto til 40?
---
Its a common term now, get with the times.
---
Or do you interperate it as a derogatory term?
---
They seem to want to keep the server number as low as possible. So my guess is probably not a lot, maybe less than 30.
---
The whole point of the layering they're doing is to prevent having to do server mergers. Essentially every realm is going to be several realms layered on top of each other; once the population becomes stable they remove the layering and those servers merge together naturally.
---
So ideally, no one will be on an unpopulated ghost town.
---
Frost mage was sleeper OP in vanilla PvP. They had insane burst since frost bolt and cone of cold could both proc shatter, and their aoe crowd control was great for big fights like this. I'm so stoked for classic.
---
Next will be disconnect screen :(
---
People who are in now seem to be 2004-2005 vets, but there's no guarantee either way. Eventually I imagine they'll start letting more people into the beta.
---
I mean, I get your example, but I think you’d find out how geared he was right after he saw you because he’d probably attack lol
---
Several of the players from the guilds above are multiglads you dumb scrub
---
Same!
---
Getting battle.net launcher to run is a bitch and a half but the game itself runs fine.
---
Frost mage was sleeper OP in vanilla PvP. They had insane burst since frost bolt and cone of cold could proc shatter simultaneously, and their aoe crowd control was great for big fights like this. The arcane explosion spam was so much more effective then too. I'm stoked for classic.
---
I also love that you thought this post was so good you had to post it a second time on reddit and link back to it on here LOL
---
Hopefully that they cancel any plans for TBC, and instead tries to take the OSRS route and keep horisontally progressing vanilla.
---
Which is what we all want.
---
I would rather have new "vanilla" content than to replay the same shit, so if they were able to take the vanilla recipe and not fuck it up, that would be fan fucking tastic.
---
Why does it have to be high level? I just enjoyed seeing people genuinely have fun doing what they were doing.
---
Human Rogue.
---
Healers don’t dps in classic wow.
---
&gt;t those who get the beta are playing the game on a regular basis and the company can be sure to get feedback from these people. How would they know you want to and would even play the beta if you aren't subscribed? How can they trust you to give them the necessary feedback? Sure, you may have tagged yourself as interested in testing Classic Beta, but this is also kind of a gift from
---
Maybe I'm old fashioned, but Beta to me has and always will mean a product that needs testing. Not a hype tool. I disagree with the idea that this beta is a gift to those still invested in their game. This is happening because Blizzard saw that there was a big enough desire to make Classic and effort worth doing. I have no issues with streamers getting into the beta, I didn't even talk about that in the post. That being said I actually think streamers, and youtubers should get in. They will have way more time to play the game, and have video evidence on bugs for Blizzard to fix the game with. Appreciate the reply.
---
Your taking it litterally. When people say "check for beta key" they just mean check battle.net to see if you have access ie have been given a beta key. Take it easy.
---
Jfc dude. If u dont want to sub then wait till august. It's a beta for part of a game that u can play on private servers. A lot of us who played in vanilla and have subs didnt get in either. Life goes on.
---
Just no it will never be me reporting you. This is exactly what I mean. This new generation must learn of hatred. They must learn why we terrorize each other. I am not some milksop, I intend on painting the walls red with the blood of knife ears. You my friend are part of what makes it all worth it.
---
You wont be worthless damage wise. You know who is worthless? A warrior getting CCd.  
---
Cleanse had the highest DPS in the game.
---
I rather not see the clock, that way I wouldn't have to think about all the time I spent not doing something else.
---
Unrelated to the tone of this thread but that’s actually really exciting to hear. I’m sure he won’t race for world firsts like he used to but I still really enjoyed his old wow content.
---
i showed my path for 72 (i was mistasken on 84) 
---
however 72 hours is with getting 8 hours of sleep for my work nights.
---
If i wasnt married i might be able to do 84
---
&gt;We all were green at some point.
---
And one day we'll turn grey  :&lt;
---
Unless we get disenchanted and turn to dust beforehand. 
---
Really makes one blue, eh?
---
What armour is the human wearing?
---
Please don’t level as prot you can do all 5 man dungeons till 55 easily as fury.
---
People overestimating the accuracy of memories is a classic problem in court testimonies.  Memory is very much malleable, and when someone experiences an episodic recollection of an event, it often seems so real to life they become convinced that is how it must have happened.
---
there's no way they don't seperate it, like why keep a wow section and then slap "BFA" onto the image, and have people playing classic under the same thing
---
i dont believe so I was in 06, it may help but it isn't a factor. As for /u/ferrety6012 being from 07 makes you old than most of the community.
---
It's free?  Dang, they should at least charge $20 or something small.  They'd make a killing!  I assume you'll need a sub still, so I guess that means they'll at least be adding that revenue from those of us that don't play retail.  I'm tempted to sub retail just to hope for a beta invite even though I wouldn't bother even downloading retail to play...
---
I really enjoy these.
---
Honestly no, the main monitor is a 35 inch. so the second monitor is barely noticable for me when playing. although im used to have a second monitor after studying serverdevelopment.
---
me too
---
So what you're saying is Classic wow should follow everything Oldschool RuneScape is doing
---
Payo is seriously underrated.
---
Welcome Home Preacher.  Welcome Home
---
Just FYI, twinks have been doing this for years, and they were recently removed from general public by Blizzard. The threads on this Reddit were shitting on twinks, calling them people who just like to prey on noobs.
---
We've been trying to keep this a part of the game for 15 years.
---
we've come a long way from having a 25-post debate on wowmeta about whether the sub should be included in the wow sub's sidebar or not
---
It could be younger people playing for the first time. I was way too young during original vanilla release, but now I'm a 19 y/o student with a lot of free time, and classes don't even start until late September/early October in my university.
---
I get it. I want to play the beta too. I too, refuse to subscribe to WoW for a sub 1% chance at playing a BETA CLIENT of the game that I want to play; its the smart choice to make. I also wish, they'd send out beta invites to non-subs, if they sent me one I'd 100% subscribe... but I'm not going to sub for the chance at one.
---
HOWEVER, I totally understand why a company would want to reward the customers that are loyal enough to already be subscribed and playing their games, and therefore supporting the development of this game.
---
It just makes sense. If there are enough stupid people willing to gamble $15 on a sub 1% chance at a beta invite that its profitable, oh well. Thats the choice they made.
---
PvE Servers are boring though.
---
As an EU player I'm not worried in the slightest. NA sounds like it might be a bit of a shitfest though. I enjoy streamers and YT content so I am not hating on them in the slightest but you have to remember it's their way of earning a living so being controversial and well known and making a huge fuss everywhere they go is part of their business plan.
---
I understand if it's "not a thing", but is it impossible? Like, if I threw in some auto-attacking here and there, would that hurt anything? Is there some mechanic I'm missing, some necessary movement? As far as I can tell; H-Palas basically just spam Flash of Light.
---
That undead drawing looks more like the loading screen than the actual loading screen does
---
Oh man I totally forgot about rolling for chests.
---
Do I need an active subscription to get it or does active game time count?
---
Oh cool. I had no idea I saw very little of naxx so the finer mechanics are lost on me. 
---
That said, not sure if it’s a UI limitation but the players here don’t seem to be fully stacked up with every conceivable buff... is the pserver fetish to max out consumable buffs completely overkill? Does it only exist to kill bosses as fast as possible?
---
I’m doing that on a private server right now
---
It sounds like you are camping all the best jobs lol. She should still be skinning, enchanting while leveling. It's the standard.
---
I couldn’t honestly see them covering up the names of their characters to the best of their abilities. They’ll probably do this for a couple of days and then announce the server and their name.
---
no I'm saying that's probably why **I** didn't really care for it.  That's about the only reason for me to watch a stream, otherwise I'll just be playing it doing that random stuff in my groups myself.
---
At least server transfers will be a thing, I really hope they will give free transfers from locked servers to lower pop ones again.
---
They were the true heroes
---
ofc
---
Well its also missing like half your tool kit from talents and spells.
---
I never said I deserved it, if so please link where I said/imply that in the post. I didn't even talk about who I thought should get into the beta or not, but it's not surprising that you would say so as I'm assuming you didn't read the post. If you want to actually know who I think should get into the beta it would I can tell you what I think. Pull people from the Classic WoW beta opt in. Pick at random with older accounts being prioritized. As I said in a different reply, I believe streamers, and youtubers should get manually invited.
---
Love ya fam.
---
Having a personal cringe compilation is cringe.
---
Your main is whatever character your investing the vast majority of your time into.
---
Also programming...
---
In 1.12 pets only retained their attack speed and looks. I have yet to see a beta player confirm pet attack speed is still unique. For example, Elder Nightsabers in Teldrassil should have 1.4 attack speed if someone wants to test it.
---
I stopped at 39 on my warrior and stomped AB for a bit, then rolled at 59 rogue and stomped everything in the 50-59 bracket.
---
It ended up getting old after a point, if that's what entertains you, than carry on.
---
The fun part about playing a warrior is that if you go 31 points deep in any of the trees, you serve a great utility.  Arms is the "PVP" tree, although it can do some decent damage too. Primarily focused around 2 handers, crit, and specializing in a weapon type. 31 point ability is Mortal Strike, which is an instant attack based on weapon damage that puts a heal debuff on your target. Fury is your "PVE DPS" tree. There are lots of great abilities in the fury tree that boost your damage output, with the 31 point ability being Bloodthirst. Another instant attack that does damage based off your attack power and heals you for a small amount for a few hits after. Dual wield is the meta for this build, but be warned that you'll need a lot of +Hit gear. Prot is the tank tree. Lots of damage mitigation + threat boost abilities are in this tree. 31 point ability is Shield slam. It's an instant attack that does damage based on your shields block value and does high threat. Prot is great for tanking but sucks for solo farming / solo content. Your kill rate is pretty low. Get a shield spike for extra damage and threat.  If you don't plan on doing 20/40 man raid content, just go with a standard Arms 31/20/0 (Mortal Strike in arms tree and 5/5 enrage in fury tree) build based on the best 2 hand weapon you have and you'll have the tools necessary to succeed in PVP. Put on damage mitigation gear and you'll do fine in 5-10 man dungeons.
---
Enh all the way to 55.  Moving into resto for hit% past Stormstrike.  Be sure to spec improved Windfury totem. 
---
At 55 you go resto and start doing dungeons. BRD has damn near 20 quests. So you grind 5mans at 55+
---
Healing is prio 1, naturally, but like I commented on the other reply; would it hurt anything if I throw in some auto-attacking?
---
Wow, I wasn't going insane last night. I tried to help a warrior who pulled too much and it wasn't letting me. Wasn't paying attention to the error text since I never do so I didn't know why it wasn't working. 
---
Ended up jumping in with a nova and just helping out directly. That needs to be fixed.
---
How many people here picked a server because of a famous build being on it and now you guys are going to lambast people for rolling on a server of their favourite streamer lol
---
Ahhhhhh, barrens chat... how I've missed ye
---
I never said I was mad because I didn't get into the beta. I quite enjoy your presumptuous thoughts on my income, or my contributions to Blizzard thought, thanks for the laugh!
---
In 1.9 they made all pets do physical damage, but they still kept their attack speed.
---
Not for the specific sounds that I find annoying.  
---
It is explained here: [https://youtu.be/BT7giMDFfBA?t=48](https://youtu.be/BT7giMDFfBA?t=48)
---
Language is important. Saying a beta key implies something specific and could confuse people that don't know that there aren't any keys.
---
Healing is prio 1! But would it hurt if I threw in some auto-attacking here and there?
---
Mace stun and CS/KS aren't on the same DR table. This is why HARP with maces was a thing all the way through the end of TBC.
---
to kinda continue on that, that would also mean that casting range is effectively 38 yards for 35 yd spells since they should get the same bonus for combat reach. What it SHOULD be though, is 5-32 (+3 minimum combat reach) to get 8-35, and spells would have 0-32 (+3 minimum combat reach). Would you agree? If it was to stay true to the 8-35, 0-35 or even 0-40 etc etc
---
I like Jdot stream a lot too. But there's also literally nothing going on in BFA right now besides the MDI keys people. Everyone is waiting on 8.2.
---
Man ....I'm going insane
---
You can judge wisdom and beat bosses to regen Hp by hitting him with auto attack but the dps you contribute will be negligible and you should only do this if you are close to oom. Generally the healers stand away from the melee group to avoid any deaths to random things.
---
Only way to fix retail is if a meteor hits Azeroth and they totally start fresh without all the bloated garbage.  
---
Probably won't happen tho lol
---
I played dps warrior in vanilla and ended up getting half t2 half t1 and as a result ended up MTing MC and parts of BWL, ZG and Ony we had pn clear.
---
I honestly was such trash cause I was just a kid but I would much rather have TF on a class like rogue for which I can actually PvP.
---
Probably because everything is dominated by RNG so the game decides what are your "daily chores", not you.
---
I'm having more fun playing old zones, just completing exploration and all quests on characters I haven't done all yet.
---
That’s my plan. I’d rather blow up gnomes than push Naxx all night.
---
healers didnt dps in classic wow
---
tbh this isnt info thats limited to people that played in Vanilla/BC.  I started in Wrath and this stuff is common sense.  Im betting theres plenty of people that have started since Cata that know it as well.
---
True, but you’ll need to talk your buddies into xferring also.
---
I plan on playing with 20 of my Vanilla buddies and will be pissed to get stuck on a streamer server.
---
Also, there will be so many streamers it won’t be funny. All the current Classic streamers that are only increasing in size. Then I know Shroud and others are coming back also.
---
It’s going to be like sifting through land mines trying to find a good server.
---
same
---
holy paladin cant even keep up with raid heals. Their damage is nonexistent. No you wont be useful trying to dps in a raid, in fact, your healing will probably be hardly useful compared to a priest. in PvP you can run around trying to heal and releasing judgements. Any decent pvper will wreck you
---
&gt; Ooo a chest! WAIT DON'T OPEN THAT! Everyone /roll to see who wins the chest.
---
Unless it's locked and you're a rogue or an engineer. Those belong to the rogue or engineer.
---
&gt; If you see someone fighting near a profession node, don't take it as they are probably trying to get it themselves. Help them kill the mobs and if they don't take it, it's all yours.
---
Maybe in the early game, but once you start doing straight node farming runs, it's first come, first serve.
---
&gt; Select Greed if you'd like it but it isn't a big deal. Select Pass if you don't need it at all.
---
You should greed on everything for the money.
---
Agreed. But this sub is too stupid to realize a good idea and will downvote you for this.
---
We could verify this against vanilla with "Hunter Over" videos, PvP hunter back in vanilla that abused both aimed and multishots to obliterate people if someone wants to do some precise measurements. This is 100% 2005-era video.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK5a3mBxiFA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK5a3mBxiFA)
---
Do you both have BFA?
---
It’s beta so yes, you will lose everything and have to start a new character.
---
if you have the free time make use of it, blizz did intend for paladin to be front line healing. 
---
I dont think many auto attacks will get in if you are casting tho.
---
I think you still judge on cooldown if you want
---
ok
---
They are going to wipe progress for release.
---
*snap*
---
yep, that one is going into my cringe compilation
---
They will be wiped for sure.
---
I dig the vodka chilling on the desk XD.
---
i'm convinced these are troll posts
---
Exactly, massive pvp raids in arathi don't require "high level gameplay" to be entertaining. Reminds me of my first pvp raid on Ratchet with 3 full raid groups and getting stuck on the boat loading screen on the way over....still fun as hell
---
Haha, danke digga!
---
do you have schizophrenia
---
This is how it is in the new wow. You're deluding yourself if you think it's gonna be fixed or wasn't intended.
---
You might not have said it but we can all read between the lines.
---
You won't keep them, no.
---
same please for link into dms or here if possible please? my main goal is only 39 twinking and alt 29, no rush or grind to 60 :-) not a kid anymore
---
You know back when I first saw that art cover, I always thought that Fireball was a bullet  from the dwarf’s gun.. and I always thought “dang, what gun or ability allows you to have such awesome looking bullets?” Lol
---
People aren’t “bashing” streamers for no reason. A lot of it is just valid criticism of these grown ass men taking a game meant for 12+ year olds and turning it into a shit show of self serving behavior. 
---
They are shock jocks pure and simple. They say and do inflammatory things to get views. Deleting items, needing everything. Its all to create controversy so people can go, “No way! They actually did that!?”
---
It’s like The Real World has invaded video games.
---
Activision-Blizzard is putting in a reporting system in Classic WOW. Game is dead or will implode depending on the implementation.
---
I don't even get mad when shit like that happens to me. I think it's hilarious, then I'll try to get you back. I'll stop questing to camp your corpse or call my guild mates. I love PVP servers.
---
People that raid with big streamers are more than capable to understand what they are signing up for. Also, it doesnt take much to gear up one person in BIS gear when it drops per phase. So i really dont see the issue. Bunch of salty people here that are getting mad cause the main tank is getting geared first? LoL. Streamer or no streamer. That would be the deal anyway.
---
you mean BFA?
---
Of course it does cost money to maintain- but any other AAA title has costs associated in those areas as well.  Even non-AAA titles!
---
Pubg for example has had a ton of dev work needed, huge server needs, and has had massive overhaul since it first debuted on Steam a couple years ago.  New maps, guns, gameplay optimization and constant bug fixes/adjustments.  They sold pubg as a one-time purchase, zero sub, and have cosmetic microtransactions to let the whales supplement their revenue streams.  
---
WoW also has microtransactions let's remember- paid character transfer, name change, or other various services.  This community seems to have a unified stance against micro-transactions within the Classic community (which I agree with) but would you REALLY be surprised when (not if!) Blizz introduces some kind of limited cash shop for in-game vanity items that don't affect gameplay?
---
WoW has sold at least 15 million individual copies plus various expansions that people buy- so even using conservative math at $60 times 15 million = 900 million dollars of revenue.  Now I think we can agree that WoW has had much more than 15 million unique players over the years, so its very likely WELL in excess of 1 billion gross revenue from just selling the basic game + various expansions.   WoD and BFA both sold over 3 million units for example.  I'm sure TBC/WOTLK were approaching or well over 10 million units sold. 
---
And if you take a very conservative average of subscription money, lets say 4 million subs on average per year at $15 apiece, that comes out to 720 million PER YEAR in subscription revenue as a rock-bottom estimate. 
---
So I'm sorry, but earning over *10 billion dollars* from your video game is more than enough.  At some point you are simply milking a cash cow and deserve to be called out.  I'm not accusing you of this at all, but I really don't comprehend some of the more vitriolic responses I get from this community regarding the cost.
---
I could totally be fine with a local famous streamer. That’d honestly make your realm identity so much better. However, if that streamer takes off and you have 30k people trying to log into your server....RIP.
---
elvui with the various addons that are included with it (like bag space being combined into 1) and clique are the only things I really care about. It wont break the gameplay, but makes the aged wowui look more modern again. Clique is there mostly to make mouseover macros easier, again not a gamebreaker, just QoL thing.
---
Agreed. But the wording of their post made many people think so.
---
Why not just completely ignore streamers? To grief them is to give them attention and fuel unneeded drama.

You mean AOE pulling 6-8 of the same mobs (literally the same with the level scaling) until you can actually do relevant content?  Leveling in BFA is on the same level as playing flappy bird on my phone.

It doesn’t matter if you said you’re not mad. You’re mad. Over a beta of a video game that’s been out for over 10 years. Yikes.

Never played wow before yet alone classic and I'm planning to play at launch. I have however played alot of LOTRO which has one of the best communites I've ever been in. Everybody is so kind for everybody. For example when our kinship(guild) leader passed away irl all of the big kins hade a mourning march through Bree with hundreds of people in it. It was very emotional.
---
There's probably a few tauren and gnome posts in there too.
---
Thank you for the great answer!
---
How exactly do they ruin servers?
---
fuck off no one gives a fuck about your favorite streamer.
---
Take a minute to read the post. I explained why I'm upset very thoroughly. I think it's important to add context to subjects, hence the long post; but, tldr: I believe the decision to make the beta sub only not only goes against blizzards own precedent already set, but it appears to be a completely greed decision. I believe that this isn't the best option to make sure the game is beta tested properly, and for us to get the best possible product.
---
That was my idea as well, and I'm not aiming to come anywhere near even the Tank on damage done, I just enjoy the feeling of being a "front line healer" rather than just sitting in the background and spamming Flash of Light.
---
Can you confirm that if you have the beta? I won't be able to use my computer until tomorrow. My PSU (power supply) died, so I'm waiting for a new one in the mail.
---
I thin no body knows good server I found [https://www.anubiswow.com/](https://www.anubiswow.com/) this server fresh and friendly people .....
---
haha yep thats who i am now... xX_legolas_Xx.  king of the noobs!
---
we were horde last time so i'm looking forward to doing the alliance side of things again, i love their cities and zones.  its just nice to have a cahnge as well
---
voting - how many of you are there haha
---
and yeah i think we are recruiting - we definitely will be when we're actually in game anyway.  our website is https://odobros.com/
---
you can check out some vids of our raids on there and you might notice that some of it's serious and some of it is us fooling around haha.  we're the type of guild that would clear BWL in no time then go and wipe on onyxia and end up laughing our asses off :D most people are from Norway/Sweden but we're quite a mixed bunch.  Me and my RL friend are British
---
we have the usual rules and expectations like getting some consumables and showing up on time and putting in effort on raids, but we're not super tryhard and we have fun on discord
---
In 1.12 I can't remember the specifics, but I believe whoever opens it has full right to its contents, its been a little while since I've opened one up.  :)
---
The worst in the game even if you have BiS ret gear on. If you're full holy you're gonna be doing no dmg
---
Banished infernal in the AH levels of greifing.
---
Laslego and his buddy Rodfo and Rimboro
---
I saw sodapoppin take the boat from stranglethorn vale to  Ratchet and the loading screen map did not show him going to Ratchet. It showed him going to what looked like a Mist of Pandaria isle. He was standing on the windows on the side of the boat in travelform if that has anything to do with it

Bruh.
---
As much as I grew to dislike the game after the Cataclysm pre-patch when they announced troll druids I had to go change my underwear.
---
I honestly thought the community here would be in the same of mind as us. I suppose we're the minority here. Appreciate your post, take care!
---
It might all be BS, but they always said they were nothing special. Same with plenty of people saying they just re-activated their sub and got an invite even though there is a Blue post that says you needed to have already been subbed and that reactivating won’t put you in the running. Again, I don’t know if it is all just internet shit, but the reason people are asking is because Blue posts and “word on the street” seem to be at odds.
---
Why does this dude has buttcheeks in his face?
---
Why shouldn't they have a burning crusade server or a wotlk server or cata? 
---
I personally love vanilla and the burning crusade where my friend really enjoys wrath. 
---
I think if they offered all expansions they would have way more subscribers and plus if they offered all expansions you could play burning crusade one day and cats they next if you wanted. 
---
I think that would be cool.
---
I'm also not against adding new content to vanilla but it has to be done in a way that doesnt destroy what vanilla is.
---
I mean dude, its only been 5 days. I will agree the numbers have been amazing but every single WoW expack release is like this.
---
Rogue and mages from what  i read and saw.
---
or as a warlock curse of dooming party members while they are possessed by the baroness... 
---
And then just casually waiting for them to die.  
---
Or summoning raid members over the ledge in blackrock mountain, so when they accept.... fwooosh!!!  in to da lava they go!
---
A lot of the streamers in this screenshot still play and stream retail like Venruki, Sco, Towelliee or Ziqo.
---
Because they have rose-tintled glasses when it comes to TBC, but as far as I am concerned thats when the game started to change for the worse.
---
Still playable, but way different than vanilla. Extreme faction imbalance (20-80) faction ratio A-H, which also truly introduced faction servers as oppose to ~50-50 ish, as Outland is fucking tiny once again.  Flying mounts, portals, , the 1-60 leveling zones were turned into single-player areas (almost all of the elites were nerfed into normal mobs). Dungeons were designed for speed-running / emblem farming, they added that shitty heroic system, and the world died of because everyone was AFK in shattrath and flying anywhere they had to go, without much reason to ever go to any zone in Azeroth.
---
God damn, how did we EVER play on dial-up? I did it too.
---
Because who cares it's cool
---
Did you also buy BFA?
---
I also *highly* value being able to PK some hordie on the same thorium rotation as me, rather than just shrugging and being sad when they mine it all first and reject my duel invitation lol. Nah fam. Fuck them, that thorium belongs to me now.
---
Tauren warrior. 
---
Undead priest. 
---
Orc shaman. 
---
Not really a fan of trolls even though I know their racial is great.
---
That’s more people than the retail servers have
---
I believe it's important to voice your concerns. I agreed in my post that it wasn't a big enough deal for me to not play classic, or to diminish my belief in the classic team. But, that doesn't change the fact this was a poor decision. Community feedback, has already been proven to have an impact specifically with Classic WoW, so why not give it?
---
yo i heard home depot is having a sales on ropes and stools...just a thought.
---
So glad that i'll be safe on Oceanic
---
If that’s what gives you joy in life...
---
The issue has more to do with what places you actually need to be. With every expansion you pretty much only needed to be within the new zones, only needed the new mats and had little to no reason to actually do anything in the old world. Hence the world got effectively smaller.
---
I have that as well with the night elf starting area and Darkshore or Ashenvale. Just wasn't my cup of tea and I always walked to the human area with my Night Elfs.
---
Since I get a to do a do-over and I am planning on reading all the quests this time, I think I will do the night elf area this time. It is still new content to me and the quests are new to me as well, unlike the rest of the game and zones.
---
Even though Darkshore is a pretty depressing area visually, I will power through it.
---
Going to miss the Westfall zone though. Westfall is my favorite area...

mana is a scarce ressource in vanilla, dpsing is a manawaste, so you Don't do it. also you stand at max range, so autoattacking is not possible, not that it would help anything.

When they were 12 and rolled a Gnome
---
entirely valid point tbh I'm a retard
---
He asked how much you will play each week, not each day.
---
So roll a Troll.  Berserking is good in PvP and no RNG required.
---
Tomato tomato.
---
100% this!

american, now everything makes sense.
---
Or constantly jumping while in the lava to avoid taking any damage
---
Or, couldn't everyone just join a LFG chat channel or a discord? I mean it's the same thing essentially. I agree with your post. Also, a massive reason LFG finder was a problem was cross realm functionality. It breaks the feeling of being on one server together, where reputation means you get a group vs. being labeled a ninja looter.
---
Will the addons on the willitclassic site that are also on the twitch client be updated from there to run on classic, or will we need to install them from other sites?
---
Last time I logged in was 5 years ago with a scroll of resurrection/free 80 character deal. Even then I couldn't play much after a few days. It was just too different and weird. Last time I seriously played was Burning Crusade. 
---
I've tried watching modern WoW streams but there's so much shit on the screen and new, weird stuff I can't relate to I don't really get anything out of it. It truly is a completely different game from the one I used to play.

if only i could get beta acess...
---
My friend and I leveled rogue druid.. he specced pure backstab build. It ensured him killing mobs and getting the buff to crit after killing. Ambush backstab repeat. It was op to be honest
---
I will find you, and I will kill you...
---
Are you honestly asking if you can get a head start just cuz you were lucky enough to get beta?
---
Exactly. The level limit should never increase and catch-up mechanics are a terrible idea, but unfortunately they are a core game design for Blizzard. Also it seemed as though they went out of their way to invalidate old content with their 'has a reduced effect for characters over a certain level' stuff on items. Even though EQ raised the level limit and trivialized old content, there were still useful and valuable rare items to obtain in the old world and early xpacs, so the journey wasn't totally invalidated.
---
With my lvl 28 ret pala hopefully named Laslego.
---
just swap to your fire resist gear and it's like relaxing in A nice warm bath!
---
If I find out a streamer is on my server I’ll probably just re-roll if I’m below the level 35.
---
I ignore streamers, but it’s impossible to ignore their lings.
---
&gt;War stomp is just the best racial in pvp hands down
---
No... Orc stun resist is far better, 25% chance to *resist* a stun is way better than an on-cast, long CD, very limited range, short duration stun. 
---
Orc for PvP Troll for PvE, but it's not game breaking either way so just do whatever you want.
---
Why do you all act like you are forced to watch these streamers you guys hate so much? Are you guys all tied up in the same basement with wow streams running 24/7? Dont like it? Dont watch it. Hilarious how "haters" prob spend more time watching the people they dislike than the people who do like them.
---
To be fair, there is a difference between having BFA and being subbed.
---
If you want to be the best at _only one thing_ (tank, damage, heals), then don't roll a druid.
---
In PVE raiding, where the encounter is scripted and the raid composition is fixed, then getting the right collection of "only good at one thing" individuals is reasonable.^1
---
But here's the rub: There are moments when you being a 100% damage dealer is less useful to the group than you being a 90% tank or 90% healer.^2 As the frequency of those moments increases, so too does the power of a druid increase.
---
The zenith of such moments is PVP; no scripting, no pre-planning, no tank-and-spank. It's pure adaptation.  Imagine you are a warrior in a PVP fight alongside your mage buddy. He's getting focused and is about to die, and if he dies, you're going to be next. Would you trade some of your theoretical maximal damage to be able to heal him back to full health?
---
Even in raids, being able to effectively change the raid composition on the fly -- even mid-combat -- can be incredibly beneficial. Need more tanks in this fight than the next? More heals? No problem.
---
The power of a druid is not in being the best at one thing all the time, it is in [_becoming_](https://youtu.be/cJMwBwFj5nQ) the right thing at the right time.
---
^1 That said, a successful raid does not require _only_ such individuals.
---
^2 Not arguing specific numbers, though the druid class designer said their goal was 90-95%.
---
I have an account from 2006 but I lost access to it, my current account is from 2015. Hurts me knowing I could’ve had access if I’d just kept the original.
---
Yeas nova and slowing CC works. The only other one that I’m almost sure would not work is banish since that makes the target immune to dmg. Sheep doesn’t work because it can heal the target. I’m pretty sure this is an intended mechanic on retail to prevent griefing, so either (a) it is an artifact from using retail as a starting point for development  (a bug) or (b) was intentionally kept.
---
Dont listen to these trolls. Ofc you will save your progress, why would anyone do it if they jsut had to do it again??? Makes no sense
---
Yup so they spend 3 blog posts bragging about how they exactly replicated the rules of warlock demon summoning and lamp post light shaders and now they go out of their way to radically change the rules of how CC works in open world combat.  
---
Yeah I think you're really onto something here.
---

Literally this, just let us know you're new, we'll take you under our wing. :)
---
There are more dumb people alive than intelligent people. There are more weak people than strong people. There are more terrible players than good players. 
---
This is why PvE will always be more popular. There are more sheep than wolves.
---
Will of the forsaken for fear in pvp/raids. Cannibalism to save me lots of gold leveling since I wont be buying as much food. 10 shadow resistance is great for later raids. 
---
Orc racials are nice but for a warrior. Pet buff is useless, all the best weapons are swords and maces at endgame, if your tanking and use bloodfury its a wipe the 25% damage is great but the -50% healing is too painful haha.  If your dps and just happen to have a good axe and not the other weapons its good though but be mindful of when you use bloodfury. If you use it when there is a lot of raid damage going on, your dead and a dead warrior does 0 dps.  Stun Resistance is amazing for pvp and can be helpful leveling but keep in mind that any scripted or boss stuns may not be resistible. 
---
Tauren have the 5% base hp bonus. Keep that in mind, it is not a buff to total hp, it is base hp. Honestly for Tauren the nature resistance and herbalism is really nice if you go that route and are pushing to get it up as quick as possible. They also have a larger model which is useful for the added reach but can make it a little easier to accidentally body pull while leveling. 
---
Trolls are also a very good choice, berserking is 15-30% haste which is good for everyone and amazing if you go dual wield furry to level. More spirit and recovering in combat can lower leveling time. 5% damage to beasts will speed leveling in the barrens a lot and can even give a dps boost in some raid content. 
---
In reality the tiny difference they all make is more for flavor and will not impact your game all that much. 
---
I personally love the way forsaken look and their animations. I leveled and main tanked as a Forsaken warrior through legion. So I am a bit biased and I also made him to crush warlocks. Multiple fear breaks makes them cry.
---
I think this is an "old" page of your transactions, and the new one is here: [https://account.blizzard.com/transactions](https://account.blizzard.com/transactions).
---
Sure thing Lasleggo!
---
I'd roll Troll for PvE, for PvP idk why you say Orc is out of the question - 25% resist is a LOT. You'd be surprised how many cheap shots / kidney shots will resist and absolutely save your life more times than you can count over the course of your classic career. 
---
Personally, as someone who used to play a rogue - it is so damn annoying to get resisted against an Orc. Happened A LOT. I think troll would be fine for both PvP and PvE. Orc or Tauren for PvP. You won't be overly gimped in either realm if you choose any of the 3 races though. Just do what you want and what looks / feels the best to you.
---
Sounds pretty fun. I can imagine throwing Freedom on my Rogue buddy and keeping him healed while he melts Mages and Hunters :D
---
that's the inevitable byproduct of outdated content...there isn't a reason to go back there. or at least, there isn't a nice shiny new purple gear reason to go back there
---
but also to be fair blizzard did introduce other ways to 'get players out in old content againn' with pet battles and archaeology and stuff
---
they can only do so much when fighting against the natural occurrence of ''burno ut'. or 'game tolerance', if that's more appealing. it's also when player-driven events become that much  more of an option: sometimes we have to make our own fun and put in effort for the community

Friends, this is not a bug. This is Polymorph working as expected in version 1.12 of World of Warcraft.  
---
I'm adding this to [the NAB forum post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887). Thank you!
---
That's just a random pic I found. When I raid healed, I'd hide the party interface, but I'd also have two chat windows instead of one (one for raid chat, one for healer chat), and I had an extra bar along the side of the screen. The overall effect was pretty similar.
---
"huh"
---
Hey. Upvote my comment pls
---
Because there's definitely no old leveling guides out there
---
I'm sure I'll see a teebus blazing long sword some day... Thanks for getting my hopes up box art
---
That made me LOL out loud!
---
I raid for progress, but I'm not gonna raid without gear.
---
Eh, it's a nice idea.
---
But by the time BC came out, the player base was spread out from  the 0.1% of fully Naxx-geared players who had nothing left to do and could one-shot fresh 60s, and fresh 60s who would have had to raid for years (or get boosted) to catch up with them. There needed to be some kind of power squish or it would just become impossible to create content that everyone could participate in and enjoy.
---
Maybe TBC "should" have had three times as many zones and taken thrice as long to level, so that 60-70 felt more like 1-60, and that would have been awesome. But it kind of ignores the real-world limitations on how fast good content can be created.

**Who we are:** A handful of friends with 14+ years of WoW experience, including hardcore progression and region-first kills.

**Goals:** Clear and farm all content whilst it is relevant. 
---
**Intended Raid Environment:** Banter.  
---
**Loot System:** Loot Council.

We still can't get cable at my parents house. Can only get dial-up, this weird radio-tower thing, or pay an arm and a leg for satellite.
---
Then the website I got my Info from must be super wrong, sorry for the misinformation!
---
Hemo rogue for sure
---
&gt; If you see someone fighting near a profession node, don't take it as they are probably trying to get it themselves.
---
That's not the WoW I remember, though I didn't start until TBC. When I was playing the rule appeared to be : If you see /u/noastronomer fighting near a node better grab it before they finish.
---
&gt; The bank rooftop is for the cool kids.
---
This was the one time in my life that I was cool.
---
The more succes classic has the higher the probability for BC and wrath Servers is what i would love to believe.
---
But, considering the industry as it is right now.. more succes could lead to a cosmetic cash shop. I just hope i'm wrong with the latter
---
I must remember to put on my fire resistance gear before fighting firemaw
---
You're not wrong. Report it and they'll fix it.

Best settle in for the naxx grind then, no gnomes will die on my watch :)

Anyone else think it looks like a small BRE?

 [https://www.twitch.tv/guzu](https://www.twitch.tv/guzu) 
---
I really like what he's doing with his stream and is really appreciative of the support he's getting during the Beta phase. :)
---
I hope he keeps it up.
---
&gt; 19 rogues FTW.
---
I see a level 19 Hunter has put a mark on you. It was nice knowing you.
---
I mean that doesn't really say that you need to have an active sub to get into the beta, only to participate. It's consistent with people saying they got in without an active sub, but needed to sub to actually play.
---
i understand where you’re coming from, I personally think that you should be eligible for the invite without a current subscription, but you need a subscription to play the beta, but then again it’s not an open beta, it’s a closed beta that’s invite only so blizzard gets to decide what requirements are. I bought game time  4 days only in hopes of getting a beta invite, not a chance i’m playing BfA lmao.
---
They're only gonna develop one line of MMOs, not two. They aren't bold enough to think they can hold the two most profitable games in the genre when everyone else makes pennies next to them. They don't wanna shoot the goose that lays the golden eggs (although not that golden next to hearthstone but the products are related)
---
So there are two obvious ways to handle this
---
A) Release TBC and continue developing retail, on this path there is nothing that will happen to BFA. Much more likely option
---
B) They throw ALL the metrics and modern game design down the drain to make an OSRS like product. Which IMO would require BFA servers to just be dead while people are leveling in classic. And even then I'm not sure they would be prepared to embrace a less objective/metric driven game design philosophy.
---
This. Try to recreate and report if anomalies happen. It's part of the bug analyis.
---
&gt;Is the 2 sec AOE stun not as good as I picture it? 
---
Its really good and you can do a lot creative stuff with it. I don't blame anyone who roll Tauren for it; but Hardiness is objectively better.  
---
&gt;Or is the trolls 30% faster cast speed in dire situations almost as good?
---
In PvP hell naw. PvP is a game of burst and CC in vanilla. If you're ever low enough to get 20-30% haste, youre just dead. Troll racials just aren't very good in PvP imo
---
In PvE Troll is the min-max racial choice because 10% spell haste has an actual use, but it doesn't matter so much that I'd play a troll if I didn't like the way they looked.
---
Scaling still exists in BfA PvP you know...
---
The only thing we know for certain is "at least 5".
---
We know that because they said you could have up to 50 characters in classic, and up to 10 characters per realm.
---
It would actually. Whenever you are not healing you should be respecting the five second rule so that means no judgement.
---
EU, Normal, Alliance, 6-11 PM GMT, Social/Raiding, form of contact - PM. Rules - Not any. I will main a Warlock most likely or maybe switch to druid because I like them both. Cheers x

"Play on a private server"

Only when they consent to it...LOL
---
You sir! You are disturbing me. I find your presence here repugnant and I will not bear it any longer! Please accept my duel invitation and fuck right off when you lose.
---
What do you mean you don't want to duel me? :(
---
Play private servers
---
&gt;Think about it, we are all a part of history.
---
You had me until this part. Relax homie. More than likely, we are all living in a simulation. This isn't even real homie.
---
\#nochanges!
---
What's the problem with Nostalrius? What am I missing
---
I'd say priest, but as of right now we have no more than 3 people commited to any class so they are all open.
---
Am i the only one thinking it was just a convenient decision because they didnt have to change anything and could literally have their launcher working like its supposed to be at launch? i dont think that an active subscription is a criteria for beta testing value, just that it works that way. you gotta sub aswell if you want to create chars on Aug 12th, etc...
---
That's how you end up with Call of Duty: The MMO though.
---
Really? I mean, if it checks out with their reference client it's all good.
---
It's been too long.
---
There need to be changes at times, otherwise the game wouldn't stay im interest. The playerbase has to change somehow. But in the end, a time is reached where the difficulty, communityfocus and rpg elements have to be readjusted back to the state of the game, where classic has been.
---
did they ever confirm if one needed to have a sub prior to betas start in order to qualify? Or is there a chance you get one now if you sub to retail wow now (odd question, but there was a poorly worded bluepost sorta stating the first one). Am not about to sub with exams atm, but perhaps after.
---
I don't think sonydigital and monkeynews are in the same boat, when ones played private server in the top guild and the other one is more retail isn't he?
---
IMO, no one cares what you've done in recent iterations of WoW. Don't tell me your lies about your "old guild," "arena rank", what you "cleared." Classic is a different beast.
---
Honestly it comes back to you a lot quicker than you'd expect. If Vanilla-WOTLK is the last memories you have of it, you have a lot less to unlearn about your class than people who've been playing all the way to BfA.
---
YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, /u/DymeGSZ
---
Took him almost a day later to get past character creation page! 
---
That’s almost half the time I took when I made my first toon and got stuck deciding which undead jaw I wanted.
---
Hmmmm, Yeah.. No...
---
I should have mentioned I don't want to play on a private server, I've never wanted to, least of all when the real thing is so close.
---
What is a "ling?"
---
I lold
---
Let me clarify, maybe you did but those add one spamming chat as you say. We're actually boss mods that other people in your raid were using. It functioned very similarly to dbm.
---
I was never one for ui addons.
---
I just use the bars I'm giving and it works fine for me. I also like to keep things simple and clean on my screen.
---
I'm not saying they will or won't, I'm saying 'if'. The current content cap will only last so long in terms of stuff to do is my point.
---
Isnt that totem twisting? I've never played shammy past 30 but I've heard of totem twisting. If so, you have to chain chug mana pots and demonic runes or you'll go OOM quick
---
Damn, still unlucky .. FeelsBadMan
---
holy shit! The beta is so fucking fun! I did not think i'd have this much fun playing vanilla wow. It is way way better than my expectations.
---
Another fan chiming in. Love the presentation style and production values. Keep up the good work.
---
No it doesn't Why would it? If someone dies IRL the loot is lost?
---
One person is in charge of the guild bank, and if you need anything from the guild bank that person needs to be online and log over to help you.
---
&gt; Blizzard's stance on private servers is that they are illegal and unwelcome
---
It's not just Blizzard's stance, it's international copyright laws.
---
Private servers use opensource emulators written from scratch by the community, the code is legal but the assets are proprietary.
---
When you publish intellectual work that's not yours without the authorization of the original author, you break the copyright, that's why pservers are illegal (it has nothing to do with piracy contrary to what some people believe).
---
There are exceptions to the law that say that if you emulate a game that's not available anymore, and you do it to preserve it and not to earn money, you're *legally authorized* to break the copyright.
---
This though unfortunately only applies to standalone games, they're fighting to make it also cover defunct online games and MMOs but they're not there yet.
---
Rogue 1v1 doesnt really need a guide, some classes can be farmed bareknuckle without them being able to do anything about it. i think a lot of people will be shocked how imbalance the game is :D (im not, i think imbalance is some kind of flavor, perfectly balanced games are boring)
---
Oh yea I see it now, thanks :)
---
I hope you dont hope to play paladin in hopes of wearing a plate chest, you'll be wearing a pretty dress and a flower offhand like the rest ;)
---
Need a dotted boat/zepplin map.
---
It exists, but gear passive effects and active effects matter more.
---
Literally cant stand any of them more and more.
---
Their fans fuel their bullshit too.
---
Yea I wish they were just transparent with this..
---
Don’t worry dude, i’ll get super downvoted but this sub is toxic as hell and everybody hate on streamers because they have the beta right now
---
Yes, certain blessings are a huge boost for various classes.  Rogues and warriors LOVE freedom, but sometimes Sacrifice is the best choice to prevent you from being CC'd. Blessing of Sac is a great way to break polymorph, fear, seduce, or sap. 
---
For rogues especially though, freedom + sprint is a pretty surefire way to catch someone!  Plus if the rogue is sheeped, feared, freeze trap/etc you can just cleanse it off as you try to keep up.
---
&gt; Which is what we all want.
---
I don't want that. Speak for yourself man.
---
I want TBC servers more than new content, I'd rather vanilla just stay vanilla.
---
But if they went that route, I definitely don't want this community voting on what gets added to the game. That will 100% lead to the death of Classic.
---
OG right here. 
---
I always loved the t6 rogue gear with glaives. That was a huge status symbol in tbc along with the spike shield from illidan.
---
RP-PvP for sure
---
Cringe
---
Shroud is going orc shaman on beta and in classic.  Dunno if Summit1g is playing, Tim hasn't decided between ret paladin or enh shaman.  Bajheera warrior ofc not sure if horde/ally, Swifty warrior too.
---
If classic turns out to be how it was back then, you'll find that same thing here. Glad to have you, and welcome.
---
Dont say I agree or anything, just stated what I heard
---
FUCK the foliage is pretty
---
&gt;That will 100% lead to the death of Classic.
---
and launching TBC will start the downwards spiral and wrath will seal its fate.
---
Tbh I'd love to see demon hunters in a classic WoW setting.
---
dynamic respawns make private servers leveling speeds invalid so its not a good comparison
---
And yet when you kill them they drop money. Where are they holding it?
---
They're blizzard. They can literally do anything. All their games are bestsellers. If they make up their mind and make profit of both games, no chance they'll throw one out the window.
---
Each flagged person i know with a 2004 account had multiple accounts on the same bnet and only had gametime on a newer account.
---
Bruh UD only DKs and Alliance-only nelf DHs would be kind of awesome. 
---
That being said though, too many faction-specific classes is going to lead to a lot of balancing issues.
---
I would far rather have TBC. You realise that the people making new content for Classic would be the devs that worked on BFA/Legion for the last 4 years right? Making the game bigger and better at 60 would be far harder than making a new expansion, I have zero faith they wouldn't fk it up. I'm not sure it even could be done.  
---
TBC has its problems but I know the core mechanics are excellent, and I know Blizzard won't fk it up- they just need to do exactly the same process as they followed for vanilla. I'd take that any day of the week over what ever is in the mystery surprise box of random stuff they will add to lvl 60.
---
Do you have to have current sub time? Or can you test it without a sub going?
---
Warrior parses higher than any other class. was true back then, is true on pservers and is true in classic
---
Blizzard is going to have to introduce guild banks or expect guild officers to share accounts.
---
I'm trying to remember where I know that name from?
---
Vaelastrasz, we told you to stay out of Stranglethorn!
---
Followers = lings
---
Haha! Perhaps I'll roll a dwarf and be your Gimli.
---
Thanks for the link dude! Will be checking it out and possibly applying. I have 5 confirmed in total, but having played a lot of legion (fk bfa tho, jesus what a failure), i have a good 100+ arena wow ppl on bnet. Far from all of those are friends, but a good bunch are. Some have yet to realize classic is amazing, biting into the foolish notion that its all nostalgia, but steadily each is coming around. Working on convincing friends from other gaming communities 2, like starcraft 2. This is gonna be the game release of the century to me, and it shines in its social aspects, so every1 is getting a poke and invite from me!
---
That sounds like a stellar guild. Reminds me of the one i had in vanilla, Jokers &amp; Smokers. Went as far as naxx, but was always true to the name. Those requirements sounds good, would even say im glad to see them.
---
That’s a good idea. Wonder if consumes is cheaper than respeccing?
---
tl;dr I can't join the beta and I'm sad
---
&gt;Which is the right decision.
---
just your opinion man
---
I love TBC.
---
Warrior, Rogue, Mage.  
---
Optimal Race is different for PvP and PvE in most scenarios:  
---
Alliance Rogue: human (pve), gnome (pvp), although human racial is pretty dope in stealth vs stealth fights..
---
Pick pocket has a chance to fail and put join in combat so maybe you're experiencing that.
---
Orc warlock for that stun resist
---
There are 2 beta servers, a PVE and a PVP realm.
---
Someone’s gotta put and end to those damn Kentucky boy farms
---
Chill the fck out. I was just confused because people are putting so much hours in the beta. And its blizzard after all.  Fkcing reddit. Cant even ask a simple question on here.
---
The client is super small, only like 5GB.
---
How do their "lings" personally affect you? I'm not trying to be flippant, either. I really am curious how someone's followers affect your ability to level, join guilds, raid, pvp, etc.
---
I mean I did and that one got banned. Anyway to find an old account that was banned?
---
welcome to twinking
---
Glad I could help someone who is clearly in need.
---
Thanks for sharing, enjoy your journey into Classic Buddy!
---
I didn't realize there was a PvE realm cause all the content I see is on PvP server
---
I don't think druids are a worthless class because that is dumb.
---
p2, so not for a few months potentially
---
It did for me. A new PTR account showed up on my battle net account page, which inspired me to restart my launcher and sure enough there was Beta.
---
This is what I thought because of WF totem. 2H fury spec. I didnt start my orc warrior till TBC so phoning a friend here
---
&gt;I would far rather have TBC. You realise that the people making new content for Classic would be the devs that worked on BFA/Legion for the last 4 years right? Making the game bigger and better at 60 would be far harder than making a new expansion, I have zero faith they wouldn't fk it up. I'm not sure it even could be done.
---
I mean, if they have passionate classic lovers at Blizzard that could take control, and just appeal to the more hardcore community, and let BFA be for the casual they wouldn't have such massive restraint when designed content, which is the case for retail which is suppose to appeal to everyone.
---
I don't have a lot of faith in Blizzard either, but its a better option than potentially ending up in fucking Wrath.
---
&gt;TBC could be done in 6 months.
---
It could be done in a day, because TBC already exists on retail, unchanged. Only thing I can think of is the classes and reverting the Isle of Quel danas.

Yea there is this thing called "oppurutnity cost"
---
Turning a profit isn't enough when you made and maintain hearthstone with 25 million and it's printed a billion dollars for you. 
---
Trust me I called the subs being combined. I understand how American capitalists work. They're not gonna bet on their ability to maintain not just the most popular MMO in the world. But now two of them? 
---
They woudl have to believe at least they could maintain margins. Which is hard to imagine when they'd have to double production costs while not having a guarantee subs will stay doubled. 
---
I'm not saying there isn't a possible scenario that could kill retail. Just it's so much higher than people seem to think it is.
---
On private servers we usually had some officer/cl or whatever act as treasurer and keep track of incoming and outgoing transactions in a google spreadsheet, and members would hit him up asking for whatever they needed. Sure it could take hours before you got it but just give the responsibility to a nolifer and it should be fine.
---
Sounds like a self help book might be in your near future then.

***Priority / Purpose:*** Raiding with the intent of clearing all the content when all is said and done. We also want to be social and get to know one another. The core group of the guild has been around for the past 2-3 years doing other Legacy Guilds on retail. 
---
***Region:*** NA
---
***Server:*** PVP
---
***Faction:*** Horde
---
***Raid Times (EST):*** 8-11 or 9-12, days TBD. Still deciding as a guild currently.
---
***Contact***: Discord. My profile is Bevok#1264, you could also contact our GM on his Discord which is Muff#9531. Here's a link to our discord server as well: [https://discord.gg/62RAekK](https://discord.gg/62RAekK)
---
***Rules / Expectations:***  There is a time and a place for all kinds of humor. Know your audience. Be respectful to those who have expressed comments. We have NSFW channels for memes and the like for those who want to run a little more rampant. 
---
***About Us / Intro:***  We are a group of excited individuals to restart the classic WoW experience and play through the new classic vanilla servers when they go live!  This guild will be a culmination of the hard work of many of the leaders we currently have. We had roots started in a guild called &lt;EVOLVE&gt; on Emerald Dream where we performed legacy content at their intended levels on live servers all the way through Throne of Thunder at level 90. We attempted a restart on Nesingwary in a guild called &lt;Ad Initio&gt; when numbers started to dwindle, but then ultimately merged with another guild called &lt;You Think You Do&gt; on Wyrmrest Accord. The leaders of this guild are experienced in the older content and have either actual Classic raiding experience or a great depth of knowledge of the old expansions. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
---
Well yeah, a lvl 29 mace that has 3 30 second charges and is farmed with a drop chance from a random low level instance being the bis raiding weapon is pretty much the text book definition of a gimmick.  
---
   
---
I don't really have a problem with it, I think it's cool, but there's really no argument that it was intended or is good game design.
---
Woo, 100k hype!
---
So what is the armor the human up front is wearing?
---
Only affects if you're killing shit that's been recently killed.
---
Well if you're just going to ignore what I actually said, and assume what I really feel, with zero evidence, how do you ever communicate with anyone in the real world? Why not just take what I write as how I feel?
---
Play what you want man
---
No that's true it's not bad at all. I just think war stomp is better when having a melee up close. And I don't like having a racial that's mostly based on one match up. Also, I don't think rogue is that big of a threat for a ranged with shield and mail? The pure threat of the stun resist is pretty good tho. Thx for making this even harder dude:(
---
ok so, its blizzard. when has blizzard EVER had beta progress carry over to any of their full releases?
---
Isn’t that a Troll quote though?
---
Dude, I had never watched asmon to yesterday, and the way he treated everyone taking everything out starting that loot was his, or yelling at people during the big pvp battle was enough to never make me watch him again. He was so entitled, treating his followers /subs that way.
---
If your goal is to top DPS charts, yeah I'd roll something else; but that something else would be Warrior or Rogue.
---
Hunters DPS falls off towards the later progression, but they provide enough unique utility that raids still bring 2-3 regardless. No reason not to play Hunter if its your cup of tea.
---
My girlfriend has never played an mmo or any kind of "hardcore" game for that matter. She's joined me on a private server while I work out what class im gonna  roll etc and she's shocked me by playing more than me over the past week. Last night she said this might be the best game she's ever played lol.
---
Give it a go. There will be tryhards but the game is super easy to get into while levelling and a lot of fun.
---
Hunters are great in PvP and okayish in PvE (bad scaling).
---
My flaw with that class is the lacking utility. EVERY class has several utility spells which make them very valuable to the raid regardless of their dmg numbers (raids are a joke anyways, cant speak for naxx though) Hunters just has tranq shot, not much else :c
---
Oh yeah, lore wise DHs have Mana Burn. Forgot about that.
---
In PvE it highly depends on the fight tbh. Ragnaros is an example where hunters do pretty good damage. Overall they are not the best, but they do contribute in more aspects than pure dmg aswell. Tranquilizing shot for example.
---
TBC has good raids, everything else is just worse than in vanilla.
---
and its also so fun when everyone is playing horde because there is absolutely no fucking reason to ever play alliance in TBC.
---
Make skilled druids be OP in classic yay
---
yeah man for sure. If you want to stay up to date with where the twinks are come classic check out xpoff.com can find basically every active twink to date posting on there (: see you in the gulch!
---
Something need doing*
---
There will be a 3rd party solution where you will have guild bank alts and an online site that allows you to see the contents of the guild bank through add-ons. This doesn't lower the stress of the owner of the bank of having to pull from it but it will help track what is in it and what is in need. It will also allow for DKP for people sharing mats with the guild bank
---
Yeah all the streamers are playing on the PVP realm, it's definitely the more popular one.
---
Lord\_Ooze is totally right.. we had a funeral + speech in SW cathedral back in the days because our holy pala died IRL... RIP Logan.. still remember his name :(
---
We al bought a smoking/black dress on AH and got some roses. Sad but beautiful at the same time.
---
Well, I meant ench with skinning - or, ideally, ench+engi  (and make gold somehow else). But tbh engi is really minor for bear PvE, DPSers in your group should have chickens. 
---
I think I'm going ench+mining myself, for flexibility with DME duo groups (can heal, can tank, can DE, can mine - can it even be soloable with very good gear..?).
---
Going to roll need on that str/sta 2H sword guys
---
Says every huntard ever
---
Best in my book is full enhance tree like  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxVbdVMux](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxVbdVMux)  (wf totem upgrade obviously for your warrior and strength for the both of you while you can ignore personal damage improvements like lightning shield because your warrior will be holding aggro). 
---
there is a discussion between 1h + shield and 2hander for shaman. Seeing how your pal will be holding aggro, I'd go 2hander as shaman until level 39 (respeccing to elemental and trying to get +sp MH + OH like  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=7685](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7685)  and Doan Dagger or zum'rahs). there are decent quest rewards that both can acquire like crescent staff, at 30 your warrior will get WW axe (you can farm it together as 2x level 30s)
---
Only itemisation wise you go like a caster from the getgo to fully live the support life. 
---
Dont get irritated when rolling on Robes and Belt of Arugal. They are *amazing* for the role you are going to play (2hander swinging int/spirit cloth shaman having his own tank, so he wont be hit for the most part).
---
39s are alpha, probably roll 39 in vanilla myself! Faster paced more abilities etc
---
Except he is wrong and it was just confirmed that he was by the community manager.
---
i skipped wow as I was busy playing the Far Superior title FF11... However, after all these years, should I finally give WoW a spin now that the refresh is coming?
---
You must have some serious issues communicating with people in the real world if you just ignore what they say, and prescribe what you think they really feel.
---
Yeah man, best to run around and explore all zones you plan on going in the future around level 10, also turn in your marks at pvp vendor super early on too (: they give like almost half a level of exp. Was a lot of fun dodging 20.
---
To fix the numbers remove the . After the number.

McCool &lt;3
---
Lol you don't even understand the original problem.
---
Seal of the Crusader has a 40% increased *chance* of proccing abilities.
---
Seal of Righteousness has a 200% increased *chance* of proccing abilities. Kevin Jordan specifically said this was not the intention.
---
This bug was in the original Vanilla. [Here's a guide from 2005 explaining it.](http://paladin-guide.blogspot.com/2005/12/seals.html)
---
who will have time to watch streams when classic launches?
---
Hah, I used that hearthstone trick frequently back in vanilla and it often worked. So not that many people used it.
---
Indeed.. the only requirement will be: Be THIS level to enter group. done.
---
&gt; Hunters just has tranq shot
---
Which, to be fair, is flat-out required for several encounters.
---
I read TF on the Paladin's book, what incidentally was also the first thing that came to my mind when I looked at this picture.
---
What’s the point of this post?
---
There are many videos and things you can find about this, but the actual streamer doesn’t affect me at all, it’s the followers that come with him.
---
Server population - you’ll be stuck in queue times because their followers will want to play with them. Servers will be maybe 10k total population, and these streamers have 60k+ people watching. You do the math.
---
The followers - will generally be younger. Nothing against younger people, but I would like my server population to vary in ages going from teens to old people. I don’t want to be surrounded on a server with people yelling kek, Send it, [insert catch phrase here].
---
Server population fallout - streamer gets bored and leaves. All of his lings follow him to his new game and you’re left in the ruins.
---
wPvP - If you run into this guy, oh boy. You’ll be swarmed by 40 people at his side. RIP.
---
Spamming - If you kill this guy, get ready for his followers to spam the living hell out of you.
---
The list goes on. These are just the major ones.
---
something  need doing\*\*
---
I saw a summoning stone on a steam yesterday, they're in.
---
Nope. I'd rather have TBC than an off-shoot of new vanilla content just so that we could have WoTLK again.
---
If you're going to take the time to comment how this is a non issue, and it's insane. Perhaps you should actually read the post, instead of assuming what was written, yeah?
---
At least ya don’t show any hate. 59 would get old because you’re so close to 60 I feel like. 19s aren’t nearly as much of an investment so you can just keep the toon at 19 forever yanno
---
Is it really that good tho? It's like having a racial for just one match up(mostly). While war stomp is really good vs all melee and casters too, plus the 5% extra HP. How many times haven't you survived getting in a heal sub 5%?
---
Are you saying this wasn't possible with vanilla macros?
---
Yes the stuff in the screenshot is drawn but why would blizzard stop drawing? Explain pls
---
Lol, each SoR hit (white damage + Holy damage) has its own chance to trigger. Sometimes you'll get double proccs, sometimes you don't.
---
[See this guide from 2005.](http://paladin-guide.blogspot.com/2005/12/seals.html)
---
Are there any EU streamers that are gonna play in classic or are we safe?
---
True, but for me this makes hunter VERY unattractive :3
---
Thank you for posting and HELPING instead of being an old bitter veteran that scoffs at anyone under the age of 35. Thanks OP and see you in Azeroth
---
Trying to create a hub for twinking come classic. Hop on and share some knowledge.  
---
[https://discord.gg/qyppPXW](https://discord.gg/qyppPXW)
---
Well, that would be the first step! Blizzard sets it up with PoopsiCoonts
---
Was looking for this comment. War mode would have been the better comparison. That shit got so laughably one-sided.
---
Well then change it to allow polymorphing tagged mobs &gt;:(
---
Im hoping people dont cling to what was 
---
We have better internet and knowledge now
---
tanks have the least competition, and all DPS warriors should be collecting tank gear for their shield wall cooldowns. But it will obviously be for offspecc.
---
Honestly, TBC was even better about it to me.
---
1. You had entirely new class combinations now that Paladins and Shamans can group together
---
2. Hunters were actually legit CC in dungeons, as traps could be laid down in combat
---
3. Rogues were actually legit CC in dungeons, as sap wouldn't take you out of stealth
---
4. It was easier to find tanks now that Paladins were legit tanks
---
5. Because different specs got buffed to be more viable (Prot Paladin, Affliction Warlock, Balance Druid) there was more replayability in leveling alts
---
&gt; Is there potential to abuse the system? Yes.
---
The rest of your post doesn't matter after this.
---
ding ding ding. We got a winner. To early to make any conclusions
---
Resto druid
---
holy paladin is a joke of a 1on1 fighter. maybe you can win vs a horrible pve specced rogue/mage but thats about it. its a very good group pvp spec, but its trash in 1on1s. literally not a single winnable matchup.
---
Active game time counts. I got in with a cancelled sub
---
How do you guys refresh your launcher to see if you got invited? Do i need to do anything but sometimes check dropdown menu or restart launcher or what??
---
      I’m sorry, but the only context I felt was added was that you felt entitled in some way because of your past relationship with Blizzard.  I bought Warcraft 1 the day it released, and I want a post-Naxx vanilla experience with new content, upright orcs, transmog, and vanilla leveling and talent trees with no flying or group finder. Does my longer history with Blizzard entitle me to those things? No. Blizzard is, and has always been, a money making enterprise. The company has changed since the days you remember, and pining for them won’t bring them back. 
---
      This is different from most “beta” tests in that it’s not a brand new game being tested. Beta tests are about two things : the first being, as you said, testing, bug finding (and these are turning up) , but there is far less of this to do. The second function of a beta is purely hype, and this is why streamers were all invited. Obviously you can’t have a streamer-only beta, so if you want to get maximum hype, you invite people who are already excited about the things you make . The proof of that is an active sub. It’s a business decision that makes sense, as in they are getting maximum return on their marketing by inviting subbed (I.e. more likely to talk positively in the community about their product) players. 
---
There really is no evidence that allowing unsubbed players to beta test Classic will provide the best product at launch.
---
I don't know much about healing but my impression always was that priests spam appropriate rank of flash heal, pretty much like palas. There's not much AoE damage to justify anything else, and raiders should mitigate it with protection potions/healthstones.
---
I wouldn't know I never anticipated in ant blizzard beta. Nor do I play any blizzard games beside wow. 
---
I'm just saying I wouldnt be surprised. Didnt realise you have to be a fanboy to post here. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Says the guy that post in all caps. Yes, I’m the one with communicating issues.
---
Thank you for this dad
---
Ppl still don't believe me when I tell them sit crit is a bug lol
---
Dude, first time watching him yesterday and how quickly he went from "OK" to "complete meltdown" and yelling at his followers and subs because of the pvp. I couldn't believe it. I know I'll probably get down voted into oblivion, but I won't be watching him again.
---
This isn't an unpopular opinion it's a fact. The only people crying about streamers is the loud cry babies.

&lt;Dominatus&gt; \[OCEANIC\] \[HORDE\] \[PVP\]
---
Time Zone: GMT+10
---
Raid times: Starting from 10:00pm GMT+10 (# of days per week TBA)
---
Goals: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
Loot: EPG Por Council (Details TBA)
---
Contact: [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX)
---
Guild info: Dominatus is a late-night, semi-hardcore guild. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+10 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
Applicants: Anyone can apply, the levelling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).

Streamers are great for Classic WoW as it increases the audience interested in Classic WoW. More people playing = better for all of us.
---
People are only hating on them as they're in the beta and we're not.
---
At least we'll have phase 2!
---
CHAMPION!
---
We have been shown that the community has an impact on Blizzards decisions. What's wrong with sharing ones thoughts to as many people as possible? Sad that you find it necessary to laugh at someone who is attempting to make the game I'm assuming we all care about better.
---
There is no tagging on retail so it can't be used to grief.
---
Yes  and now
---
Goes both ways , largely increase population while playing and / or destroy servers should they decide to quit
---
If you're running from point a to point b and see other players just throw a buff or two on them. Chances are you are sitting at 100%mana anyway.
---
Its a good way to help out and dosnt really slow you down at all. Plus you may get a buff back!
---
Don't concern yourself with the community as a whole here. Remember, the more people that start the show up, the higher the number of idiots as well. This subreddit just passed 100k. So...
---
Does anybody know if this is an actually quest/event/dungeon/raid ? Or was it just part of the box art advertising?
---
As I wrote in the post, I am going to wait and still support and play the game. That doesn't mean I can't or shouldn't share my thoughts about what I believe is a poor decision.
---
I played several MMOs in over a decade and LoTRO has the most friendly and helpful community I've ever seen, by a long shot.
---
People can be awesome in WoW too but LoTRO's community is just a whole different level of awesome, no other game comes close to it.
---
yeah I really don’t understand why people were upset about streamers and servers and all that. it doesn’t make a difference to me, they’re just another player.
---
A lot of people have already mentioned it but no I don't think there will be a severe lack of hunters.
---
I'm sure there will be a large amount of people that haven't played Vanilla before that googled "best levelling/best solo/best farming class wow vanilla" and then roll a Hunter.
---
Not to mention that Hunter IS the most played class in Retail which I'm sure will make a lot of Retail players that want to try Classic out, roll a Hunter.
---
Now I do think that there will be a huge amount til like 30 ish and then dip down significantly. But let's be honest, if a completely new player is to reach max, Hunter would be the class to reach it on.
---
Thanks for the kind words. Nice to still see you hanging around btw, Wyke!
---
Why would they invite you to beta test their game if they don't think you even play WoW anymore you knob
---
Where did you get the idea that I think it should be an open door to walk through?
---
While we're on the subject, do the pet stances work like they did in Classic (i.e. defensive instead of assist)?
---
this is still not fixed in BFA btw and it has been reported since beta
---
0.5 sec is faster than any melee wep swing time. 2 min isn't a "long" CD imo, would've been totally broken if it were shorter.
---
25% stun resist is mostly for countering one class out of 9. I'd rather have 5% more hp plus war stomp than an rng based counter vs rogues. 25% is a lot tho I'll admit. But rogues doesn't feel like the biggest threat for a ele shammy with shield and mail. Warriors are worse, and war stomp + grande can literally save lives
---
Asmon soda timthetatman lirik shroud methfan that's all I can think of
---
Oh c'mon leggo lasleggo
---
I may be wrong, but wasn't he also the one who bug reported a boss being OP, while he ran in with LoS on heals and broken gear?
---
Female dwarves
---
I was watching Soda's stream and he said the same thing except it's to give him the vital extra 5-10 minutes to escape the very start where all of the stream snipers will be. 
---
I don't think any large-ish streamer will be announcing what server they play on to the dismay of the community and will be taking the selfish approach with it. Truthfully I think that they just want to be able to play the game as normally as possible and hope that by not announcing their server name before release they'll manage to end up somewhere with a decent population of regular players who don't follow the stream regardless as to how shit it iwl be for those non followers.
---
Yeah Engi is super broken in pvp.
---
Satire? Can't tell. Either way I posted the link to the official forums on the bottom of the post. Support isn't necessary. I just wanted to share my experiences with Blizzard, and how I think a recent decision isn't the best option.
---
/2 LF Tank &lt;Insert dungeon&gt; last spot!
---
Basically your life if you're not a tank. For dungeons anyway.
---
That's op in pvp dude
---
Influencers are very good for the game, they promote the game and keeps the community invested, especally if they start stupid drama.
---
My one and only char besides the bank
---
This is part of the reason that I dislike them "being the voice" of the community
---
Sure they are in the same game, but their experience is gonna way different that everybody elses. Not only can they play 24/7. but they also get everything handed to them, and GL if you end up disagreeing on something with them in game
---
Some realms arent gonna be wow, its gonna be "World of Streamers"
---
I play for nov 27th 2004 until TBC, no other expansion had as much workd pvp. None
---
This sub is going to explode by the time Classic WoW is actually here. hype
---
You realise you can keep the azerite system without gear? I think it was called glyphs or talents or something.  
---
What im saying is that you can have all the raids be simply a place you walk into and attempt. No requirements, nothing. Just go in and try. The progression and "scaling" will only be done by difficulty settings. Good enough to beat heroic? Try mythic.
---
Go on an instant 60 private server...Practice
---
It's much more about understanding random items/consumes. Over half your binds will be things not in your class kit.
---
Obviously in a duel on the alliance it doesn't matter.
---
But out in the world the consumes will matter and you will get hammered if you haven't been exposed to all the random crap one can pull outta their bag.
---
Well i dont have beta myself sadly.
---
Best bet would be to AoE grind humanoids for cloth. Or grind some profitable beasts and just buy the cloth. 
---
Either way it’s gonna be expensive for you, either directly, or from losing out on profit.
---
so why try something again that was proven to not work?
---
So your saying no one should use meld in duels? Or when an orc resists a stun it should be null? It’s part of the game. You use everything otherwise it’s pointless
---
This definitely needs a follow-up made in a "reaction" style with each streamer's reaction being inserted right after their cameo.
---
I don’t have access to me email for my original bnet account, do you know if you need to see the email or can you just see it through your client?
---
Good DPS until Naxx. Then they fall behind due to bad scaling.
---
man Rust is such a nolifer game. I love playing it but if you dont commit 80% of your time when they server wipe good luck getting anywhere. Then its straight up 2-3 days work getting everything done while hoping you dont get raided between 6am and 12pm while you sleep. 
---
After that you can play and have fun for a week  until the next wipe comes lol.
---
I hope one of my boys makes some sort of post of a realm list to avoid big streamers lol
---
There is a lot of issues with keeping a beta only for active subscriptions, but a main argument against it is Blizzard themselves. The precedent set by THEM is that beta is completely free, and active subscriptions are not needed.
---
Man these up/down votes have been a roller coaster. Must have triggered his fans earlier...
---
Orc rogue/warrior
---
Undead rogue
---
Dwarf priest
---
Gnome mage
---
Night Elf hunters for AFK ganking lowbies (sit in stealth, put pet on aggressive and take a shower or whatever, and keep your productivity high)
---
Exactly. Geez people are so dum. You think streamers would play for 6 hours grinding a shitty lvl 28 blue off SM rares if it just became meaningless in 2 weeks??? You think they’re idiots or something?
---
By naxx no. Consumes destroy your life in naxx. It's why guilds fall apart. It's not just that the raid is hard. it's that it's hard and you farmed your ass off to be here. People love their guild clowns until Naxx. Then they want to hang them. Naxx is in my opinion a horrible raid. It's gear is way over tuned and it's not fun. That is my only worry for classic. Naxx is a game killer. Nothing good comes from that shit pile.
---
Any idea what spec he is running there?
---
That was never the case in 1.12
---
I’m with you, there are streamers I like, but I only consume their content on YouTube when I’m sure it’s something I’ll be into on it’s own merits. I never watch because of the person making the content, but I will stop watching because of the person making the content. One sodapoppin and one asmongold video were enough for me forever, but I’ll watch TipsOutBaby’s videos on YouTube. I’ll never watch on Twitch just because I’m not sure if the content will be something I like, but if it’s on YouTube with a description of what I’m looking to watch, it’s easier to filter out.
---
Healers and tanks will always be in demand, especially when leveling. The best classes for lack of gear competition are Shaman/Pally due to their unique itemization for healing. Holy Pallies are the only int plate wearers, and shaman are the only spell/int mail users (although hunters will always take gear they can use :P). After that, the rest of the classes are sort of equal, hunters being the outlier as they are the only alliance class and one of two horse classes that use mail.
---
I've said this in nearly every thread about streamers; there are pros and cons to playing a server with a notable streamer. It is going to vary by individual as to whether those pros outweigh the cons.
---
For me, the pros do outweigh them, but I can understand how someone could find it irritating or detracting from their idealized vanilla experience.
---
Rogues only compete with other Rogues, so that's my answer. Mages, Warlocks, and the occasional Spriest all compete for cloth gear, Fury Warriors will be a lot more meta in this iteration and will compete for plate gear with both themselves and Prot Warriors (and Warriors are the highest proportion of WoW classes), and healers will all compete for non-tier gear. And Hunters will compete with everyone for everything because everything is Hunter gear.
---
But actually, maybe Hunters too. Pretty much all mail gear will go to Hunters because Enh Shamans are functionally nonexistent in raids, and while Feral Druids aren't exactly common, sometimes you'll have some OT Ferals who use the same gear as Rogues.
---
As for class demand? Expect 8-10 Warriors of any particular spec, 11-13 healers with Druids being the least used, and the remaining ~20 spots being taken up by about 6-7 Mages, 4-5 Rogues, 3-4 Warlocks, 2-3 Hunters (more in early raids, but they don't scale well past AQ), and various remaining spots based on guild composition, availability, and a few one-off specs like, again, Shadowpriest or OT Feral.
---
Retail works fine on Linux, I don't use WINE alone, I use Lutris, much easier to keep everything updated.
---
There was someone here saying they've tried the beta on Linux and it was working too, I'll try to find the post.
---
This combo is sounding more and more appealing to me. I feel like both cover each other's weaknesses pretty well, and it seems like one of the most solid 2v2 combos. I suppose to maximize this I should go Holy.

&gt; Some people just dont want to pay. It will still happen.

Yeah bro, that's why there's dozens of BFA and Legion private servers...o wait lmfao

If you only care about topping meters then go rogue or warrior, but honestly going for being #1 on dps is just stupid. There is differences between classes, that's just something you should accept. Beating others of your class is the priority, and hunters is a really fun class to minmax dps with, so I would definitely recommend it. Main downside really is just getting a raidspot, especially early on.
---
Don't spend your DKP all in one place and bookmark thottbot
---
but seriously i would say just enjoy yourself, if you want the true newb experience just go with it, otherwise you can watch a ton of leveling on stream and bookmark wowhead classic.
---
You don’t play any blizzard games but still throw out shade like “it’s blizzard you never know”
---
You wouldn’t be surprised if they let people keep their characters? You’d be ok with people getting a 3 month head start over others?
---
I do not think you could ever name pets like this. Always single worded.
---
&gt;focusabathurguys
---
Messaged you both
---
i'm not looking for that level of authenticity, but with your username i'd expect nothing less. you're a mad genius
---
Appreciate it! Then I can keep checking the account page at battle.net at least. Thank you for the info!
---
pvp isnt about dps. 
---
Warriors are the best dps, and yet they suck 1v1 and without a healer will lose to almost any class.
---
Hunter is one of the most viable and skill based class, they got certain abilities that render other classes useless. Viper sting has no cooldown and can be cast on multiple targets. If you arnt familiar with vanilla, the game is all about mana. You go oom fast and theres no way to recover from that in mid pvp, so viper sting is one of the most powerful spells in the game for pvp. Flares and serpent stings make rogues a joke. If they open up first, feign death, frost trap, hunters mark, serpent sting, and they cant do anything; just keep your distance with aspect of cheetah.  You can kite literally any class while your pet is on them. Only until they get their epic mount can you not kite. Plus as a hunter you can solo low level dungeon bosses such as Maraudon at 60 to make quick cash because of feign death. 
---
Mage will go oom too fast and then youre worthless. You're only good with mana and i hated playing one because you dont have any endurance whatsoever after the first 5 spells. You might blow up someone with AoE or frostbolts, but after you go oom its game. Hence hunters, i hated them so much because theyd vipersting you and it was game over before you even got to attack. 
---
Lock is the same way. It takes too slow to put up all the dots and by then, the vipersting already has taken most your mana away. Surely if you're geared its a different story, but the class is still boring and squishy. 
---
The only class youll realistically have trouble against is a good druid since theyll starfire your cheetah as you try and kite away and you cant mana drain them in their forms.
---
I really wish that people would look at betas as intended they are. If people listened to the Classic Team this is obviously intended to be a 'real' beta, not a hype tool. Being "rewarded" is not a thing that should be associated with betas. You are giving company's your time, to test, and help fix their game for free. I suppose this idea has been corrupted over the years, but it still remains the best option for all involved.  Take care.
---
I don't get why somebody would out effort in against classic wow? Don't like it? Fine. But why I. The world would you be against it?
---
Can we make this the most upvoted thing ever!
---
I saw them too, but in watching streamers playing they weren't usable. Not sure if they're working now as I haven't seen any gameplay in a several days, or what the outcome will be at launch.
---
The litle gank mercy
---
Ofc
---
Last xpansion i bought was legion, fyi. Got in last week. US tho. Dec 04 acct creation.
---
Tanks for sure, they're usually the ones getting geared out first.
---
For specific class, I think Druid personally has the least competition. There definitely still is competition, but compared to other classes, less for sure.
---
Where did I say i would be ok with it? And i do play a blizzard game. Cant you read?

I have a hard time believing a lot of bigger streamers like Asmongold, Esfand, Sodapoppin, and Shroud will up and quit. Shroud said himself that he might push R14. Asmongold has been streaming WoW for years, Esfand has been playing nonstop. I understand the concern but I mean, look at the game we are talking about. Vanilla has been ruining careers and marriages since it came out!
---
Classy.
---
Yes, but it appears as an additional PTR account (WoW4 for me). It will not say "classic beta".
---
Except thats not how it was in 1.12.  You could polymorph others tagged mobs.
---
60 twink
---
The fact you’re so surprised that they would delete all your progress for a BETA makes me think you’re just trolling.
---
No i understand. See my comment on this thread.
---
Reefer madness is a pandemic.
---
Rogues compete with warriors, hunters and druids.
---
Even you were to say that is exactly what's happening it wouldn't mean that's a good business decision for the health of the game. That's my point the decision any way you slice it, was poor. Appreciate your thoughts.
---
You only need to be prot in order to main tank/off tank progression.
---
Awesome. Despite what people in here think, griefing was never an accepted part of vanilla.
---
NO CHANGES AMIRIGHT?
---
Ffs. I never said im surprised. How dis this even turn out to a discussion. I just asked a simple question. Im out. Bye.
---
Nah, forget holy.  While leveling you won't be PVPing or instancing too much, mostly just grinding with each other and the occasional PVP.  You want to be as strong as you can be on your own, and for that reason I'd say go ret from the outset, MAYBE respec to prot around level 40 depending on your playstyle.  All the fun stuff we've talked about is doable as any spec- but at least you will do a lot more damage as ret or as prot (later on) than as holy. 
---
Around level 40 is when a paladin can do effective AOE pulls but a rogue partner won't really help you at all there, so really I would just stick with Ret and single-target damage focus.  Prot spec would mean you could tank whatever dungeon you want though, so there's that!
---
A great (and relatively rare) choice.
---
inb4delete
---
You're right, thank you, didn't know that.
---
Actually, almost right :)
---
What is Reputation Reduction?
---
This is the term given to the effect seen when a Reputation from a mob or quest is lower because of the level difference. Once the mob goes Grey, or a quest is six levels below you, you lose 20% of the total Reputation possible for the kill/completion for each level. This goes this way for four levels, until you reach the minimum Reputation gain of 20%. Example:
---
Morrowgrain to Darnassus/Feathermoon Stronghold is a level 50 quest. At level 56 it becomes Grey. The level rewards look like this:
---
LevelPointsPercentage47 - 5525 points100%Level 5620 points80%Level 5715 points60%Level 5810 points40%Level 595 points20%Level 605 points20%
---
Maybe I just out geared everybody, but it didnt really matter. 
---
I had more hp, armor, damage and speed then everybody in WSG.
---
Yes. The question you asked was very simple. And has been asked hundreds of times. It’s so simple that with common sense you could answer it yourself.
---
tl;dr, I don't read posts, and comment something that has no merit in being true. If anything I'm more sad about people like you who decide to prescribed feelings to people without any evidence supporting thing instead of actually have a dialogue on the subject at hand. Hopefully this can change.
---
True! My bad
---
For what, exactly? I guess they can compete with Hunters for leather DPS gear, but there's plenty of plate and mail gear for Warriors to work with, and pretty much all Druids in raids will be Resto.
---
I read about as much as I could possibly stomach
---
Horde warriors
---
&gt; You may think that this is just Druid and they're a worthless class. 
---
Keep spreading this meme, less on druids on launch :)
---
tauren master race, a lot of people forget u can remove stuns already with pvp trinket.
---
I just did that LOL. I’m hoping and praying I get into the Classic beta!
---
&gt;everyone 
---
You really gotta stop with this "everyone" and "we" thing. The playerbase isn't the Zerg Swarm.
---
Believe it or not, some players at the time believed that endgame raiding *ruined* WoW!
---
Here's one of my favorite posts from back then:
---
My account is from 2005 still not in :( only beta I got into ever from Blizzard was wrath of lich king one.
---
So what is this because I don't follow exactly what we are complaining about...
---
/Cast frenzied regen
---
/Cast !bear form
---
And this macro wasn't possible in vanilla?
---
Even if you break that macro though, I can easily replicate it with binds?
---
You're not trying to make the game better, you are mad a company is doing something to try to make money and you are mad that streamers get to play the game first. I wish I had access to but I'm not going to cry about it on the internet.
---
Against the sub rules to ask this, man. And it's also easily answered with a Google search.
---
Google the most popular questing hub in EPL
---
yes, ure right, i just think they put way too less thought in it instead of being overly greedy. which isnt better  :D
---
Weird, I don't see where the whining is in the post. Maybe you can educate me on what whining is, and where it is?
---
no, druids can't use pots or healthstones while in form, and this macro takes him out, eats the pot and puts him back in bearform almost instantly, which I am 100% certain was not possible in classic.
---
WeakAuras/ElvUI would be so nice after playing with it for years ;-;  
---
Pretty sure it would ruin the feel of classic though, but still &lt;/3
---
Elysium
---
Some dps warriors would wear leather.
---
How about outside leveling and life at 60 as a warlock/mage duo?
---
Or those of us who lived through Dark Iron.
---
Well to be technical, it is breaking the rules, there’s no need for the quotations...some people prefer to enjoy themselves than care about piracy and such things
---
I hadn't thought of that, you're right, TBC world is already in the modern client. I think it's extremely likely we'll see TBC then, people will be clamouring for it once they're through vanilla content and it would be very easy and straightforward to add. Adding new content to 60 would be absolute dev hell by comparison. They could even feasibly do both.
---
For a hybrid ele. Both orc and tauren are acceptable but, I think Tauren is way better. On a hybrid class getting of a spell is way bigger then potentially resisting a stun. Also once you get good gear and a bad ass shield. Rogues are not going to be a problem for you anyway. So while you can pick orc. Tauren is better. People telling you orc is better have never actually played imo.
---
Does anyone have \*any kind\* of proof that polymorph actually worked this way in 1.12 classic?
---
It has been a dream of mine, and I want it to be the best it can be for everyone, veterans and newbies.  
---
I hope you're with me in the Horde, otherwise I'll see you in battle. Lok'tar ogar!
---
Warriors and hunters take leather gear as well as weapons. No PvE warrior cares if it's leather, mail or plate.
---
They literally have a 1.12 server running to check
---
It's impossible, by the time you get there you won't be level 1 anymore.
---
Wow classic beta plus 2005 retail account here
---
Activated my account, after 8 years of inactivity, on last Friday 
---
Got my invite a few hours ago
---
I was i.pressed by how smooth it was. Hyped for sure
---
Added to list in edits.
---
its not a summoning stone in vanilla, its a meeting stone and they have 0 purpose.
---
The video that should be posted anytime this village comes up:
---
[https://youtu.be/TsFpfQC\_FME](https://youtu.be/TsFpfQC_FME)
---
People have been min-maxing since Wrath at least, when "most people" got obsessed with gearscore, so why  would it be any different this time?
---
It wouldn't, and the glaring flaws of TBC would fine shine through, and Blizzard would probably step in to enforce faction balance, or just bring in the human racial from wrath to stop the madness.
---
I get it, but I don't like it. I really dislike it.
---
One bank alt per "kind" of ressource + one for enchanting, all run by different officers, so that if one goes awol you don't lose everything. Also prevents that one person holding the guild bank hostage from gaining too much power.
---
It's unethical business practice to sell subscriptions by selling chances to get in testing, basically lottery tickets. It's all legal and smart thing to do but it still shows how corporate like the decision making is in Blizzard. If they wished to sell subscriptions and not look like assholes, they could have given beta access for random players that needed to confirm ''the code'' by subscribing during a time limit or their entry would have been given someone else. I won't support this but everyone else is free to do whatever they pleases.
---
Let's just hope they manage to make classic working well enough and they won't do further bullshit schemes. I've been done with Blizzard's greed the longest time now but I'm still looking forward to classic launch. Blizzard really should appreciate the developer who managed to resurrect this amazing masterpiece and make this all possible again. Without it, Blizzard would have remained as dead to me.
---
Does Dun Morogh still look awful with the grass on high? That definitely needs fixing.
---
Ewwwww.
---
Where does any of that comes from? Did you really read the post? It doesn't seem the least bit relevant to anything I said. I already said in the post that this doesn't ruin Classic WoW for me, nor does it make the Classic Team untrustworthy. I'm saying that I don't think it's in the best interest of making the best game possible to make Classic WoW Beta only available to those who are subscribed. Even Blizzard has agreed with me on this, just look at past precedent set by themselves.
---
Nope, they're not fixing it. It was [just added to the Not-A-Bug list](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887/13).
---
Warstomp is way better. The stun resist is nice but, to a shaman it's gravy.
---
The tomes gave you your max spell ranks, unobtainable from trainers
---
wouldn't it be Odfro?
---
that is tips
---
arena isn't a thing in classic.
---
Until late vanilla which they were changed to summon players, this was done just prior to TBC release.
---
Yes some spells are only learned from their tomes that drop off mobs. AQ has a lot of tomes like that. And mages have the one in dire maul for the good water.
---
Since my original comment was removed for being "mean"...  
---
The paladin who rolled on agil leather gloves is an outstanding example of a good person and excellent gamership.  
---
We should all be so lucky to have such a wonderful member in our dungeon groups.   
---
Going forth, I shall also emulate this man in all future excursions for the benefit of my faction and the joy and entertainment of those who follow me into battle. What a wonderful time everyone will have.
---
Judging it from the people I played classic with and threads like this/ twitch you needs to have an account from 2005 (EU) at most to get in.    
---
If you are From 2006 like me you are pretty far back in the queue because a lot of 2005’s aren’t in still.  
---
I think for NA it’s all 2004.
---
Theres a lot of trust involved in vanilla banking for guilds, I think thats the bottom line but we used a similar thing on our guild website where you could see lists of what was in there and request if you needed something pre Guild banks.
---
Patch 2.0.1 (2006-12-05): Meeting Stones now function similar to a Warlock Summon spell.
---
I'm not saying they CAN'T wear leather. Just that in terms of raid competition, Warriors are more likely to be afforded gear Rogues literally can't wear, and there are more Rogues than Hunters, so a reasonable guild would allocate leather DPS gear to their Rogues first since that's the only option for the Rogues.
---
War Stomp is pretty good for shamans.  Guaranteed Fire Nova totem + chainlightning.  Pretty underrated interaction IMO.
---
Ahh, I see. Is this for all offensive spells or just some?
---
Half of why I want classic is just to stretch my hooves next to my pet and explore again
---
&gt; Stop ruining the game,
---
If tiny changes bother you then I have some disappointing news for you...
---
I think it would be a good PR for Blizz to disprove such myths with short footage from reference client, not only with words. If they're not willing to give testers the access to it. But I guess it's too much to ask.
---
There are probably many fun combinations. The only thing I think is required would be a dps with decent cc.
---
I you have a Good hunter it might be fun to try a pet tank. That would increase group dps immenely.
---
In tbc me and My wife had two 2-man projects: hunter + hybrid ele/resto shaman and priest+ prot pala. Both worked fine. I think prot pala has a lot in the warrior tank before end game (and the abscence of gear) just because of blessings.
---
Hunter mage paladin sounds like a really fun party to me. I dont know how doable it would be but it feels like a good challenge.
---
I did. She aint fat but I cant see one part of her that looks like it hasnt been plastic surgery'd
---
My play group plans on having: 
---
Prot pally
---
Sanctity aura holy pally
---
Balance druid
---
Fire destro lock
---
And Frost mage (which is not a meme spec) 
---
We like doing fast dungeon runs.
---
Only some, however there are also def spells acquired as well, like Prayer of fort for priests
---
Yes DoTs count towards the debuff limit and it does affect Warlocks DPS potential.
---
everything that is a debuff, including dots, count as debuffs.  
---
farmed exalted in alterac valley for the dagger? too bad, you shouldnt equip it cause it will override another debuff with a spirit debuff iirc
---
Thanks, I had a feeling I had the wrong person.
---
It was only some spells, actually pretty limited selection of spells. Most of them were pretty common for "required" spells, some of them polymorph turtle which is just cosmetic were more rare.
---
Well then you’re reading from a bad source.
---
No they are vastly overstating how important stun resist is to a shaman. It does not change your match ups at all. Warstomp will though. Stun resist or not if you are getting spells off vs. a rogue. He's either a fuck up or you warstomped on him.
---
I remember alot dropping from AQ so go do that
---
&gt;Adding new content to 60 would be absolute dev hell by comparison.
---
If we take Molten core as a reference point, it was made in less than a week and is still a classic favorite among many people, and imo it still holds up in terms of vanilla. Its obviously not nax tier, but I would assume that designing content for vanilla would be significantly less time consuming, and less difficult than designing mythic raids on retail with 4 or 5 difficulties.
---
&gt;people will be clamouring for it once they're through vanilla content
---
I know they will, but its a huge fucking mistake.
---
&gt;They could even feasibly do both.
---
I doubt they will split their playerbase up that much, or do you think they would have a version of WoW for every wow expansion be playable? Doesn't seem feasible to me to split the playerbase into 3, or 4 or 7.
---
damn, a lot of people in here got in. hopefully NA gets a generous round like this soon.
---
Quiet old man!
---
It’s very realistic as it’s happened on many games, including wow.
---
People form groups (they may do it solo too, but as you said, that really has no affect) to raid specific servers and cause problems for those “wanting to be in a safe haven”
---
Full on guilds have been formed due to people just wanting to ruin someone’s day. WoW isn’t the only one it happens to, I’ve seen it in Ark, Rift, BDO, ect.  Said streamer will say something akin to “I don’t want to ruin x server with my community so I avoid playing there” or anything, and mobs form.
---
Yeah, it sounds stupid as hell that someone would want to do it. I know. But they do, and whatever “fun” they get out of it makes them do it again.
---
For “most” streamers it’s a non-issue. It’s just when you have the major ones.
---
You could instant power shift in vanilla.
---
I got an email a day after it showed up in my launcher.
---
Go away
---
Useless members of society?
---
shifting is on global cooldown in vanilla, its slow regardless if you have macro or not and you cant shift from cat to bear with macro without going to normal form first unless its changed somehow.
---
As I said, its a number thrown around often. Not sure the source i don't believe Blizzard has ever actually said. But you could figure it out pretty close with some mods back in the day (/who each zone).
---
Litterally I am the goblin ripping the bong in the back
---
Time to level / HKs for me.
---
As a warlock you spam shadowbolt 95% of the time. May sound boring but at least mages are doing the similar thing.
---
Almost every class can have some sort of stun. Paladin hammer of justice, warrior intercept, blackout procs on shadow priest just to name a couple.
---
But I would say go Troll if you enjoy the look of them the most. You will find yourself getting creative and making the most of your abilities regardless of race choice.
---
lvl 19 hunter twink
---
Haha RIP the devilsaur mafia idiots
---
Yes dots count which is why Destro is your preferred raid spec.
---
I'm looking forward to streamers. I'm going to stream snipe them and chain sap them until raid time and bask in their salt.
---
Might be because its swedish and the server is far away. Lesson learned though, on reddit fuskbugg isnt as good as imgur :)
---
In WoW, you get [this funeral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ)
---
This is called power shifting and it’s kinda the core of playing feral in vanilla. It’s hard to manage it well while not screwing yourself on mana, so it’s not as OP as it seems at a glance.
---
theres a novel idea
---
Say you complete In Dreams.  Do you take the neck for dps or the chest for tanking?
---
No clue why I got downvoted.
---
It means Warlocks need to run SM/Ruin specs. Sometimes one Corruption or two can stick depending on the raid comp, but in general Affliction Warlocks simply don't work in Vanilla due to that mechanic.
---
very accurate. you can look at the old "god" PVPers or people that were doing Naxxramas and see that many of them clicked and sometimes keyboard turned, which now-a-days, you'd be raked over the coals for.
---
Said the same thing...then I got a beta invite...
---
&gt; I think the biggest concern people really have is stuff like login-queues
---
Layering solves that issue though.
---
This is such trash
---
Watched Asmongold for half an hour and realised he doesn’t have a clue about classic (don’t know if he had claimed to tho)
---
joined!
---
I took a look at your posts to see what type of lavish life you're living - lol.
---
Can’t wait to see a screenshot of your first dungeon :) 
---
It’s really great getting to follow all these folks in the beta
---
Make sure to always have food and water
---
In raids yeah. When you are working towards your pre raid dungeon blues. Rogues. Hunters and warriors share alot of gear. Especially rogues and warriors
---
Blacksmith makes the keys not engineer
---
Well blizzard was initially going to be implementing sharding which is many times worse than layering.
---
Belfs were a mistake man. They were just too pretty/handsome with an awesome lore. They appealed to all the people that love playing good-looking characters such as female humans or female nelfs. Not to mention they were typical fantasy elves with gorgeous cities and culture. 
---
I see why they added them to the Horde but they basically stole half the Alliance playerbase when adding them. :( 
---
horde was the ugly faction, outcasts, primitive beast like creatures fighting for their survival. Alliance were the humanoid, pretty fantasy af faction with awesome castles and actual cities. 
---
Sad that the line got blurred so much in that xpac.
---
They clarified. You must have an active sub to get an invite.
---
Then you're wrong, it was possible in vanilla.  Forms were not on the GCD which meant they could totally be macrod.
---
That sounds awesome
---
orc stun res is a lot different from non passives
---
how does meld help in a duel? i don't play alliance so please inform me
---
hes dabbing brother
---
Well Blizzard initially implemented none of that and it was AMAZING
---
I think this is actually why twinking is bad for us, most of the time. You don't learn anything by beating people using a massive gear advantage, and you spoil the game for people who are just trying to have some PvP fun while they level.
---
If Sprint is on cooldown any decent hunter that catches you out in the open ought to be able to get you 100-0 without you doing any damage to them at all.

 &lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 9pm PST on tues/thurs and sat, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at A13X#3733 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly.
---
&gt;Belfs were a mistake man.
---
The biggest insult is that belf paladins are way better than alliance paladins, which is just yet another reason to pick horde over alliance in TBC.
---
Belfs had that seal of blood which actually made ret somewhat good, while alliance paladins gets a shitty dot that does nothing I think.
---
{star}{star} GZ!!!! {star}{star}
---
Cant believe the MMO that will dethrone WoW, is WoW.
---
Ages ago I raised on a pserver with a shaman tank. He put in a ton of work getting himself, making sure to always have every possible consumable, etc.
---
He was never going to be as resilient as the guild's main tank, but he could offtank as well as anyone, and arguably made a better main tank for Chromaggus.
---
You have to be with people willing to give you a chance but there's all sorts of off-meta stuff you can get up to that makes the game so much more fun.
---
No, in Vanilla, you don't do armor prio. Issue is, available mail/plate is usually worse than available leather. On *rare*  occasions when it's not so, rogues may indeed get a slightly higher prio on leather.
---
Still gl getting trinkets, rings, backs and swords.
---
yes it does. i leveled to 13 on my UD rogue and as an Rp pvper i enjoyed the lore this time around. when I was a kid in 04 i leveled a rogue but in NE world.
---
***MrrllLGgllrrlLL Intensifies***
---
is it the same with banish or exclusive to polymorph? not on the beta so unsure, because I remember banishing none tapped mobs in TBC, I was trolling my friend at the time ha (So assuming that happened in vanilla too)
---
Honestly, what is your problem? I'm actually curious. I wrote this post because I care about the game, and want to make sure it succeeds. Is that inherently bad? I would think we're on the same side here. Do you not want the best possible product?
---
Streamers are going to play PVE servers. Asmond was throwing a tantrum the entire time.
---
Nothing can match it. Mages and Hunters are 100% the best at farming mobs. Warlocks are good at it too, but they're not in the same league as Mage and Hunter.
---
I don't think they're so much worse at making gold, that it would stop me from rolling Warlock if that was my preference.
---
I remember once all the discs were installed, it started patching and it had to do every single patch from the start of vanilla (I stated in BC) one by one. 
---
I thought it kept just installing the same update over and over again until... I Finally saw that sweet load screen come up.
---
People kept playing 3.5 straight through 4th edition.
---
5th edition is popular though.
---
I forgot about Blacksmithing, but you're also wrong. Engineers have Seaforium Charges. And the level 300 Engineering method is MUCH cheaper than the Blacksmithing method.
---
Didn't it show up near the end?
---
Maybe, but it's all workarounds that won't be implemented into ElvUI anytime soon. On retail the UI does have those things displayed, and there are API functions or whatever to incorporate it into your addons. In classic you will have to do it some other way, like having a database with health numbers, and checking the combat log/whatever for casts and counting the time down from that.
---
Frost mages are inherently superior for farming gold. There's no substitute really.
---
Yeah, it could probably be macrod. But there is no way the game would respond that fast, where you left bearform for 0.1 sec
---
Why are we even considering pre-raid stuff, though? If you don't want competition, simply don't take along other dps who compete with you. There's a surplus of dps characters for 5-mans. I'm not saying that you can always avoid it, but it's not like you're fighting against more than one other dude when you're in a dungeon.
---
If you're going by pre-raid gearing, then we might as well say healers have the least competition because no 5-man will ever have more than one healer. Competition is pretty irrelevant when it comes to dungeons; it's not nonexistent, but it's certainly not so detrimental that OP would have made a post about it if that's what he meant.
---
Chad goblin bongs out, while alliance and horde jockey for power... Time is money friend...
---
The API is based on retails, so it will happen v quickly
---
Mine starts in 2012 with a diablo 3 purchase but I’ve played wow since vanilla. Any idea why I’m only seeing back to 2012? Maybe I need to view it on a desktop?
---
Warlocks armt the best but they arnt the worst. Should be fine if you enjoy lock that much.
---
Yeah dabbin that bong.
---
Nah man, it takes guts to admit when you're wrong. Appreciate it. Reasonable to expect that, I can agree on. That's why I signed off on the post by saying that I'm possibly an naive fan. Take care!
---
PvP BY FAR orc is best. 25% stun resist is insanely high for a stat that can't be found anywhere else in the game outside talents that' I'm aware of. And everyone has a stun (grenades). Plus some classes that's what their kit is built around BM hunter, rogue, and paladin. And obviously resisting 1/4 of the intercepts you're ever going to get is pretty awesome too
---
Paladin &gt; Shaman because Shaman is a hybrid (and totems were a poor design choice, too easy for your enemy to counter play relative to every other class, Shamans great for raping people worse than you, not good for facing people as good or better than you)
---
But if you wanna play shaman PvE only answer is PROBABLY troll, i only play alliance. You will never need war stomp in any PvE. Many ways to cc mobs for a LONG time outside your base kit. 
---
For PvP there is only one answer, Orc. Stun resist so broken so tilting so stupid. Worse design choice that made it to 1.12 easily beyond maybe not taking away totems (which again have inherent problems no game dev can solve in pvp)
---
My favorite world dragon memory was one time we were fighting the dragon that shoots shadow bolts out of one side of it (Lethon?) We had been fighting off a Horde raid for hours going back and forth trying to get the kill, We had the dragon to 50% and saw the horde regrouping. Quickly we used our big gamer brains and repositioned the boss so that all the shadow bolts would be cast facing the oncoming raid. The horde charged into a volley of shadow bolts shortly followed by a flurry of sappers and victory was ours.
---
Same boat.
---
Yussssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
---
I always mained a warlock back then. Why is it that hunters are so much better at farming? (I never tried a hunter til Wrath, so I'm genuinely curious.)
---
Seriously! Vanilla servers and vanilla soda haha
---
When MOP came out, me and a friend created a Panda together.   We had most of the BOA gear.  I was the tank monk, and my friend was healing monk.   I didn't pull rooms.  I pulled damn near the whole instance.
---
WTF Fuck
---
Maybe I should postpone my attempted escape from the world of NEEThood.
---
They got the shove to make it happen.
---
Yeah.  
---
Source: trust me bro
---
Well you can use it to interrupt a cast, restealth if you’re a rogue or Druid, use it for a free extra trap if you’re a hunter. It’s honestly an insane tool, you can even use it in pve to do all the same things including clearing agro.
---
appeared in legion beta -&gt; reported the shit out of it in beta -&gt; fixed in legion before last raid launch
---
appeared back in bfa beta -&gt; reported the shit out of it in beta -&gt;still not fixed
---
This happens in m+, felguard will come back to me and hang out.  At least he isn't my main damage source.
---
A small vocal crowd is just hurt by Blizzards smart marketing strategy of giving influencers beta access, even though plenty of others have it as well. You are very right.
---
Honestly my guy, why not just get along. I would think we both want the same thing. I want Classic WoW to best the best it can be. Do you also want this? If you think the way I'm going about it is wrong, and want to take the time to talk to me about it, that's fine. We're on the same team here in my eyes, lets have a conversation about it.
---
As a #nochanges person, I agree. The updated graphics and lighting is phenomenal
---
Have you never seen a big game release on twitch before? Numbers from the first week really can't be compared to months in
---
First two images show the first warlock that I created. I played it early to mid 2015, after which I started over (again a warlock) on a new PvP server that launched later that year in the EU region. With that character I raided all the way to Naxxramas as well as clearing a lot of TBC content as the 3rd and 4th screenshot show. 5th screenshot shows that I haven't been on the first character in a very long time.
---
I hope we get at least a blue response on this.  I'd like to know if they are looking at it or if it will get perma-ignored.  I like "pet classes" and this would affect hunters and locks.
---
okay thanks
---
I played a 19 rogue myself that was very geared. As long as I had a spot to LoS I could beat most hunters. If they caught me in the open I was fucked.
---
Seriously, getting into the beta would be fun and all. But it’s not like if you don’t you can’t play the game on release. 
---
And correct me if Im wrong. But isn’t all the progress you make in beta going to be wiped on launch? 
---
If so, who cares if you get in or not.
---
the email comes usually about 24 hours after you get your invite, you need to check on the launcher
---
You know the account was only made to talk shit when most of the comments are downvoted and the account is not even a year old

He's more interesting talking about things, than when he's playing the game.
---
It’s like gear score but instead of measuring your gear it tracks what dungeons you have experience with
---
&gt;mechanic that isn't anywhere close to how it worked in Vanilla
---
Guess we need /u/Kaivax again to confirm/deny it.
---
Yes. And that's why almost everyone goes some variant of destro for locks, so that they aren't eating up all of the debuff slots.
---
I don't understand what's so bad about wanting to play without that type of external influence on your server. Just like back in the day most people avoided goon squad. You want to play with your streamer friends that's fine. Some of us don't.
---
Not how I remember it on my mage, it's how it was. 
---
I think...
---
It certainly do be like that.
---
Settle down grandpa
---
Can it though?
---
Where did I post in all caps? The original post is in all caps because when you make a official blizzard post it converts it into that. I just copied and pasted from the blizzard forums to here. What's with the hate? My guy we're on the same team, I would think. We both want Classic WoW to be great. My post is exactly about that, why can't we be civil, and if you disagree with something I wrote tell me and maybe we can come to an understanding? Cheers!
---
Seems Wave is over. RIP.
---
With the way instances work so far in the beta, you'll hit the instance cap on warlock the same as Hunter. That being said frost mage is still better
---
It's all about money. They know people are willing to pay to play the game in early stages. They seemingly knew that people were willing to subscribe for a chance without any concrete proof that one would ever get in and without telling how many months does it take until one gets the access. It's free money from Bob who last played at the beginning of cataclysm, and who is stuck in the old world now. He has to either suck it and just wait or play through the content and perhaps even buy BFA while waiting.
---
If they really just wanted people to pay while testing them they could have given the access for the accounts that are opt in beta. The accounts could have confirmed the code by just subscribing or it would have been given to next player after a few days. But they decided to milk the fools instead..
---
Your title is literally all caps. It does not do that automatically.
---
guy definitely he knows his audience
---
You're smack in the middle of being a millennial, fyi.
---
Generations have definitions, you aren't a "boomer" just because you're hating on something that people enjoy. The last boomers were born in the early 60s.

Shift *in* is on GCD. Shift *out* is definitely not, otherwise you wouldn't be able to rejuv yourself out of form. I guess it means OP is wrong..?
---
They split Oldschool Runescape from Runescape 3.  I would imagine that, once Classic releases, it will also be split out.
---
Tauren would be the best if they hadn't messed up this shield and made it retarded looking.

That said I remember being a massive target in PVP I remember my feelings of wanting to be tiny and wishing I wasn't immediately the one that was targeted. But that I fixed with spam noggenfoggers. I really liked warstomp. I never really played an Orc, but I do know that the stun resists only works when you are fighting one and not when you are one.

Alliance is better looking than Horde, this checks out.

They stated themselves that they didn't feel ready to release another class, so most likely it wouldn't have become a thing no matter for that early. Then for WotLK a demon hunter class didn't really fit the theme anymore, but a death knight did, one that had also previously been discussed - you probably start to see a trend, heroes from WC3 were pretty much all discussed to some extend. Many classes were also made from WC3 heroes or even a mix of several.
---
If you search around you can actually see Blizzard talking about these things at several occasions. They even released pictures of an early Hellfire Peninsula zone meant for Vanilla. It was still the red zone, but much more simple looking (being in early development, after all). Still, some of the landmarks of TBC Hellfire were even present in this very early version for Vanilla.
---
Paladins will for surely complain, otherwise Classic isn't authentic.
---
Thats sweet!
---
How does not giving invites to people subbed to their game result in an inferior product?  They CLEARLY have FAR more willing beta testers than they need under the model they’ve chosen to go with.
---
Your entire post stinks of you whining about not getting into the beta because you refuse to sub.  The ~14 pointless, drama filled paragraphs before you get to your actual point are vomit inducing.  Read every comment to this joke of a post if you don’t agree.
---
Let me guess tho, it’s every single other person in the world that’s wrong, it’s not you.
---
I recommend (take my reccomendations with a grain of salt lol) to level warrior as fury or arms!  You should still be able to tank dungs just by poppin on a sword and board, and pvp fairly well!  Just my 2c.
---
*Everyone* competes for things like trinkets and rings. They asked who had the least competition, not who had no competition whatsoever. Of course Rogues are going to compete with all other AP-based dps for AP trinkets, just like Mages are going to have to compete with all other SD-based dps for SD trinkets. But that's something that should be obvious to anyone. If it's not, we might as well say the MT has the least competition for gear because most tank gear defaults to them over the OTs. But that's not true in its own way, because the MT has the *most* competition for a guild spot in the first place, so it's substantially *harder* to get gear as a Prot Warrior simply due to out-of-raid slot competition (whereas there will usually be several of other DPS specs).
---
There are fewer Rogues and Hunters in a raid than there are Mages and Warlocks, and outside of very clearly obviously multi-class competition items like trinkets, Rogues will mostly be competing against other Rogues first and foremost, because there's a wider breadth of available gear for Warriors and Hunters, while Mage/Warlock spell damage gear is directly 1:1 save for one-off items like Fel Infused Leggings. So a combination of there being fewer people to compete with, and half of the people you're competing with have larger armor pools to choose from, means that you'll either be spending DKP less often, or Loot Councils will be assigning you wearable gear more regularly when wearable gear does drop.
---
We might as well not try to answer OP's question at all if we start taking trinkets and rings into account.
---
asking the real questions
---
Pretty much sums up this entire subreddit. I can't wait for them to hear that damage is working as intended (which people have shown numerous proof that it is).
---
Dude same. Growing up I would play at my uncles until he passed away when I was 11. After that I couldn't play for a year until I got internet and my own computer, so I would just stare at the box and read the manual every day to get my fix haha. Eventually I'd move on to looking at the armory and wow site at the library until I could play it when BC came out.
---
I actually have ONE week until my classes start again. I'm going to go ham, I want level 30-40 at least.
---
not even on damage done, it's on DPS lol
---
Thank you for the reply and sorry that it took me so long to reply to you. It's just you described Eredun so thank you for elaborating this in my place.
---
The video was about two specific spots on the coast. The left one was supposed to take you to the starting zone of the dwarves and on retail it took me to new Tinkertown's graveyard.
---
The other one that didn't work on retail was the right one that was supposed to bring me to Ironforge's graveyard.
---
Once again thank you for taking the time to read and test this. I'm looking forward to your reply.
---
Without those of us who have been loyal Blizzard customers throughout the years there would be no classic WoW. Period. Blizzard used subscriber money to develop the beta to the state it's in, so why should subscribers not get priority access? You're entitled. Blizzard owes you nothing. Don't play if it's such a cash grab. Don't pay. Nobody will miss you, seriously.
---
&gt;Since when is a Blizzard Beta only available to those who are subbed? I can’t see this decision any other way than a cash grab. If I’m wrong I’d love for some clarity on the situation.
---
So what you're saying is you disagree with Blizzard only letting subscribers beta test? So therefore you did talk about who you think should get into the beta. 
---
&gt;This decision hurts what I believe the Classic Team is trying to achieve. It hurts Blizzard. I will not pay for a chance to get into a beta to test a game, simply out of principle. I wonder how many Vanilla vets like myself will opt out of this beta, and from what I see it honestly looks like a beta, it needs to be tested thoroughly.
---
Cool. Good for you. No shit it's a beta. Why do you think they called it a beta? It's not early access. Nobody owes you anything. Nobody cares.
---
You sound like a whiny BFA welfare epic baby. Waaaaah Blizzard I deserve it!!!!
---
You'll still be able to farm easily- possible to solo instances or farm single-target in the world.  Not as good as hunter or frost mage but still better than normal.
---
Honestly, I really don't think the streamer is the issue.  They come in all varieties.  Some good, some bad, some assholes.  A single person, you can avoid.
---
The issue comes with the fanbase.  Streamers bring out the best, and the worse out of their communities, and vice versa, fans egg their streamers on.
---
I would not want to be on the server as the fans, even of the streamers I do like watching like Shroud, much less being on the same server of streamers I do not like.
---
And do you have the 1.12 reference code to base this off of like blizzard does?
---
World of Warcraft was a very private and spiritual experience to me. I remember the immersion between my teenage mind and those zones. I don't want to see some streamer run his mouth while plowing through those zones as it disrupts the sacred feelings I still hold towards the game.
---
it resets....the streamers are just playing 6 hours a day because they want totreamers themselves said its reseting.
---
Thanks for sharing
---
The Vanilla Ten Commandments, I like it. Good work, OP.
---
Strippin isn't big enough, nor is his community toxic enough to ruin a server all on his own
---
this shit gets asked literally every 30 minutes, just read one of the other posts or google it
---
Previous stances were Aggressive (attack anything within aggro radius), Defensive (attack anything that attacks Hunter or Pet, or anything attacked by Hunter), and Passive (do nothing unless explicitly ordered to).
---
Current live stances are Assist (attack anything attacked by Hunter), Defensive (attack anything that attacks Hunter or Pet), and Passive (do nothing unless explicitly ordered to).
---
It is worth noting that when the stances changed, we lost not only Aggressive, but also the old Defensive behavior. In return, we got Assist (which was half of old Defensive) and new Defensive (the other half of old Defensive).
---
Classy, as always.
---
RIP in peace
---
Sounds sick dude!
---
Its hilarious to see you use the "rose tinted glasses" argument against TBC, oh the irony.
---
Dude they have the god damn server running. Stop pretending you know better than Blizzard itself when the server itself is running the damn game.
---
If they say it is working as intended THEN IT IS WORKING AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO.
---
Your memory is not right. Stop it.
---
I am having a hard time believe this existed in 1.12 since I can't find this change anywhere in the patch notes.
---
1-58 there was no flying!
---
Would be interesting for sure.  If it produced this kind of game play, it would be great.
---
Legit first week into it and we're already getting epic battles.
---
This is a sad day for assholes like. RIP chain banish...
---
Or you could believe the guys who have the actual code and who do not have to refer to blurry decade old memories. Or search for it on YouTube yourself. But I guess it's to much to ask.
---
Move to a non dead server then.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
---
- [/r/classicwow] [CM Kaivax has given us an update on the damage discrepancy of mobs (specifically durotar tigers). TL;DR it was a stoneskin totem bug.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br22sb/cm_kaivax_has_given_us_an_update_on_the_damage/)

---
It's far more difficult to get into a guild as a Main Tank than it is to be some random dps or healer spec. MTs might have the least competition when they're actually in a guild, but they will have *fierce* competition to even get into a good guild in the first place. So while in a vacuum you can say "Well, there's only one MT per guild, so that MT doesn't have to compete with anyone for first pick on good gear," it ignores the fact that OP is trying to figure out how easy it will be for them to gear up, and saying "Just be the MT of a progression raiding guild lol" is reductionist.
---
Not only this but what does "not even remotely close to being done" even mean if you aren't going to specify what it is you're doing?  
---
I cant have any idea how close anyone is to "done" anything if I don't even know what the goal is. I could say it about the worst game in the planet if I wanted to, I could say I've played 100 hours and I'm not even close to done and it's completely unfalsifiable and intangible.
---
I noticed,and as I’m Norwegian I doubt that is the case. 
---
But the difference is miniscule though :)
---
I love this fucking bot
---
It's interesting. During the last Blizzcon I made an equally lengthy post about loot trading, phases, sharding, ext. It was received very well by this community. Even the people who disagreed were pretty civil and a lot of the time we came to an understanding. Perhaps you're right, maybe this sub reddit has become overrun with a different type of player.
---
I'm already on a full server. 
---
The game is just not what it used to be. 
---
No more community.
---
Reeeeeee entitlement.
---
The question was about gear though, not skill.
---
So the difference between what you're referencing and what I'm asking about is... in your example there is proof and in my example I am asking for proof of this mechanic in vanilla/1.12.
---
Guaranteed to be a retail player. lol gg
---
I am not being a wiseass.
---
I am fine with OP saying he reported it cause he thought it was a bug.
---
I am tired of people pretending they know better than an actual server and state things as a fact just because of some hazy memory or because of a private server.
---
NO SINGLE BUG should be reported as matter of fact. It should be approached as "Hey I think it was this way so I am going to report it so devs can check".
---
Not "THIS IS HOW IT WAS BLiZZaRd I KNOW BETTER" which is 90% of this sub.
---
I mean look at mob damage. We have NUMEROUS videos from Joana, youtube of dungeon runs, etc showing that damage numbers are what they are supposed to be. Yet this entire sub is saying no Blizzard is wrong my memory is better.
---
I think I'm still confused on the details.
---
What mechanic is in place to determine what debuff stays on the boss? Is it first come first serve? Like if I insta dot corruption and it's the first debuff it sticks, but later on if I use corruption and there are already 16 debuffs it just does nothing?
---
Is affliction viable at any point? Because I really, really love affliction and dotting.
---
I mained a mage in actual vanilla and you absolutely could not sheep tapped mobs in the latter half of vanilla. My account was made in 2004 and I actually do not even remember a time when you could (though I wouldn't doubt that you could early on and I just don't remember it, because I played more and more as time went on, so most of my playtime was in 2006).
---
This is known. ["World map path indicators during transport loading screens may be inaccurate"](https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=50413&amp;region=eu)
---
ty ty
---
Look at Steam and how many alpha/beta games they end up selling.  It is sadly the new norm.
---
Did you actively subscribe?
---
Is this the same for every tier? Like once BWL or Naxx release do locks still play destro? I really wanted to play affliction.
---
Private servers are a better reference than your memory of Vanilla from 2005.
---
Definitely. I want to read every quest and play the game at my own, slow pace and I would love to have an add-on that presents the quest descriptions in a better way so it's much nicer to read and get immersed. It was my favorite add-on when I played Legion last year. It's a perfect type of add-on. It doesn't influence the game mechanics, it doesn't change the original intent of Blizzard, it simply presents the same information that is already available but in a much better way.
---
link doesnt work
---
What more proof do you need than Blizzard, who have a working 1.12 server/client, saying that this is how it was?
---
Blizzard doesn't owe you a video over every little "feature" that people think is a bug.
---
Blizzard said it is working as intended. It is working as intended.
---
Bingo, my first 60 war a warrior and it was terrible.  Got to 60 and got to be the "pug tank" for a bunch of randoms bossing you around.  You can't get in a guild unless you're somewhat geared and it was impossible to get pre raid geared pugging dungeons for a bunch of idiots.  Not to mention like you said if you aren't the MT or one of the earlier people to 60 to get a chance to get geared guilds really don't need anymore warriors.  Thats why when i made my 2nd 60 i went warlock which was the least played class with druid.  Literally went to my first MC raid and got 3 pieces of warlock tier cause nobody else could use it.
---
don't @ me peasant
---
Nothing, never unsubbed since July 2005. Fuck Blizzard.
---
&gt;Surely most of those viewers know they're just a dust spec on a big streamer's radar and that realistically they'd have zero-to-little shot of interacting with them, ever.
---
Have you seen the way people act around streamers? Every MMO it is the same. Crowds of people spamming words, spamming trade, making dumb art out of dead bodies or droped items, and so on. People are willing to look like a complete idiot to hear their name on a stream or be acknowledged by the streamer for something they did/said.
---
I'm still seeing an active trade chat and active guild but when you give people options to not deal with other people you'll automatically gravitate to that.
---
Communites are restrained to guilds and discords now that's all.
---
Even if they don’t outright “quit”, a lot of server activity will revolve around their play time. If they take a break between phases, activity may drop precipitously. It wouldn’t be an organic community.
---
Dwarf Rogue &gt; all others (at least on Alliance).
---
He has NS, Insect swarm, Nature's grasp, no Feral Charge, Wizard Oil on Weapon for Spell Damage and spamming Moonfire hence deep Balance, so I'd say it's 30/0/21 like this :  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zpxhMxsxZVxfoLo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zpxhMxsxZVxfoLo) :)
---
I never paid attention to locks when I originally played vanilla, but I don't recall our RL saying only certain people could dot/debuff. I'm assuming for casual raids people just do whatever.
---
But in more serious raids, does the RL specify ahead of time what or who can debuff the target?
---
I came close to doing that an hour ago when the new invites went out and I still am not invited.....
---
Nothing better than saving it for a few weeks and getting a real satisfying donk and screen wobble!
---
So it is blizzlike then
---
I went orc on ND, and regretted it all the way to 60. I’m with you on how fascinating troll lore is, and being a Shaman makes it all the better. I say go troll. Provides you with meta PvE racials while also looking badass.
---
This battle had over 2 full raid groups on each side at one point and some players that weren’t even in the groups.
---
They didn't hit max level, they finally killed the no-lifer.
---
ElvUI is better.
---
ElvUI already confirmed on discord
---
how do you check this? I checked my purchase history but it only goes back to 2010 even tho i started in 2005
---
Minmaxing isn't even that good in PvP. Too many factors. E.g. you see someone in open world, you pop Berserking to nuke faster and are glad to not be tauren. Or on BG, you pop it on low HP but in safe place and OP heal yourself/everyone.
---
Play what you like, you're going to see your toon for hundreds of hours, can't hate the looks.
---
On the other hand, a serious PvPer is a tiny Noggenfogger skeleton anyway :)
---
not prior, exactly with tbc release.
---
Damn where was your parents' house?
---
I’ll never understand why so many people make it their life’s mission to defend Blizzard from mean comments on the internet. Why do you care?
---
Imagine Blizzard literally telling you *this is not a bug* and your brain going *no, I know better*
---
You like spamming shadow bolt son? Cuz you'll have to learn, lol
---
Warlock is very complex in a BG like WSG
---
Not so much generally on most fights, only thing to do early beyond spam shadowbolt and maintain raid assigned curse is banish things. Which is very handy in MC especially in a sloppier guild
---
There were very few bosses back then with some kind of enrage mechanic.  Which might be why there wasn't really a need for dps meters and whatnot.
---
&gt; That can last 5 years
---
Here is the problem. There will always be people that no-life the game and burn through everything as fast as possible. The only way to prevent that is to drip feed the content. Since you need to release content over time, it makes sense to release as soon as you have enough to start and then work on the next release as people work through what already is released.
---
Thank you for your diligence. You guys are doing good work! Keep on communicating!
---
Teleportation to the dungeon AND the fact they’re not on your realm usually so you’ll never see them again
---
u guys stink
---
I need that Int for more arcane shots and the SD for better damage on said arcane shots damnit!
---
No, it's not first come first served, per se. Certain debuffs have "priority" (you'd have to look them up) and will stick on a boss if someone else tries to put one on at the 16 cap. For instance—being qualified to talk about this as a raid Shadowpriest—Shadow Word: Pain and Shadow Weaving are both high-priority debuffs and will stick on a target against most other debuffs, while the Undead Priest spell Devouring Plague is low priority and will be pushed off almost immediately (and it's also horrible dps for its mana cost, so it's never used). Other stuff like Imp. Sunder Armor will stick around for a while.
---
And no, Affliction is never, ever viable in a raid scenario unless, for some reason, you have no other Warlocks or a Warlock-buffing SPriest. In that instance, since you aren't competing for any spell debuffs, you can probably get yours on in the power vacuum. But good luck being in a guild that wants only one Warlock with a strictly inferior damage output to the popular Warlock spec, who also blocks other Locks from joining, and also can't run with a Spriest to buff them. If you want to screw around with Affliction, you'll need to use it as your PvP offspec.
---
OK, couple questions.
---
1. Did you get an email too or do you just have to spam check your launcher?
---
2. Do you have to "update" the launcher or anything or will it just appear in the dropdown doing nothing at all?
---
Exactly. 
---
I dont see anyone looking for groups or wanting to trade, asking for enchants/blacksmiths. 
---
Bfa is a solo rpg right now and it needs to change. 
---
Working with other people and feeling the sense of a community is important to me.
---
Right. Engineering makes seaforium charges - which can open doors but NOT unlock chests.
---
maturb8
---
Fascinating. Perhaps not for Classic (or maybe in a few years), but temporary level syncing for certain modes or tasks can be beneficial.
---
One thing I don't like in theme park MMOs is how so much of the game becomes irrelevant with higher level gear/levels. Especially with increased level caps, just makes my past dungeon/raid achievements (as in the actual gear earned from it) obsolete.
---
Mage goes best with priests, rogues or druids. Second best for warlocks, paladins or monks. Horrible with warriors.
---
Good, but not great. An equally geared hunter is never going to beat a mage, rogue, or warrior.
---
I only saw some EU players getting, wasn't sure if it was for NA as well, December 2004 and active sub, still no invite here.
---
Oh dear. Reddit being Reddit in this thread!  
---
The misinformation in these replies are grand. Keep them up.
---
You were either losing your job or skipping school. Never on a Tuesday though. Waiting on server reset just wasn't worth it lol
---
Kaivax does. He works for Blizz and can't be wrong.
---
I’ve never watched any live Twitch streams before this weekend. I think I’ll be spending a lot of time there until Classic launches
---
&gt;Moist
---
Come to the Horde, we're really fun I promise.
---
So proof in this case would be more than just words. And I am asking if anyone (not just Blizzard) has any kind of footage (or demonstrable proof) of this mechanic actually being a part of 1.12 or any of classic.
---
I'm glad that Blizzard's word is good enough for you; that is fantastic! While I don't feel that anyone owes it to me to deliver video evidence in support (or contradicting) this Blizzard employee's claims, I would love to see some.
---
Cheers mate!
---
yes, you will forever play destro and only spam shadow bolt, is the exact same reason why there is only 1 spriest per raid and arms warrior is not wanted at all
---
Excactly! xd
---
I'm happy people get to experience the beta, but then I realize that I still haven't been invited to it myself and I then get depressed :(
---
i don't think stoneskin totem is enough to stop elites from 1 hitting players 10 lvls above them like they did in true vanilla difficulty, please buff mobs 1000% save classik
---
NA should check their launchers around 7 EST
---
the macros would be something like
---
\-debuff cat (no gcd)
---
\-drink potion (no gcd)
---
\-become tubby boi (gcd when shifting into bear)
---
It looks a hell of a lot smoother in that clip but only 1 of those actions (the last one) is incurring a GCD. I assume this method is to get a larger amount of healing from a health potion because it heals you in human form before multiplying your hp back into bear form.
---
The most recently cast sticks.  You overwrite an effectively random debuff.  Typically each debuff is assigned and only those assigned to debuff cast.  So an aff lock who hasn't been assigned a slot gets removed pretty quick because the entire raid is losing spell damage or risking armor dedux or similar.
---
Let's see who wins. This guy beating KT ot blizzard releasing classic.
---
Nice. ElvUI + Clique is all I need as healer.
---
I heard great ele shaman gear drops on AQ. So I’m fine never stepping into Naxx. I mostly wana PvP and just raid as needed so my gear stays relevant
---
Right? Like these poor trolls must have such miserable lives to find joy in stealing others video game names. It’s a pity, really.
---
source?
---
Prefer the combo over using Healbot or Vuhdo, as those require too much customization to get working.
---
The culture clash I am seeing already between new people and vets is ninja-looting lowbie gear as a joke.   
---
Listen, I get why this is a joke on live. All of the low level content flies by and most everyone has heirlooms anyway so nothing is an upgrade.   
---
NOT SO on classic. Low level shit is important. People won't find your edgy ninja loot joke funny or original
---
Every previous NA wave releasing at 7 EST
---
dont worry ill hook you up brah my dad is chris metzen
---
Thanks for the heads up!  I can't afford to put anymore holes in my wall..
---
Said the same thing...then I downloaded Elysian private server...no looking back now, I'll be ready come August!!
---
I think this would make more sense in /r/wow.
---
Get gatherer
---
I'm gonna try to get a good 15hrs in per week, however, September is usually a very busy time for me.  
---
Come November-February, I just may not leave my house except for work xD
---
Resub for beta invite is a useful metric for them to gauge returning player interest to plan for accurate server capacity at launch.
---
As there is no product to preorder it will be very difficult to gauge the number of players interested without something like this. The sub to reserve names doesn't won't give them enough time.
---
The Jaina template is not Vanilla.
---
THEY MADE A VANILLA MTN DEW!?!?!?!?!?
---
you need to be friendly to get the 1-6
---
And here I am being downvoted for saying Rogues don't get a lot of competition compared to tanks "because Fury Warriors and Hunters also use Leather gear and AP trinkets". Like, obviously people who use AP will use AP jewelry. Still gonna be less competition in a metagaming sense than attempting to be a MT or even an OT in a guild worth its salt.
---
People will clear content faster than they did in Vanilla simply because of our expanded knowledge bases, years of min/maxing on PServers, and a more robust modern infrastructure for raiding. So I expect there will be more "viable raiding guilds" on a server than there were in 2005. But there will also be more people per server because Blizzard is trying to make every server as high pop as possible without long-term overflow.
---
Alas.
---
Locks don't have the resource conservation or aoe to efficiently solo farm like a mage or hunter.
---
However, if you can get a pocket healer (either double boxing or farming with a friend) lifetap and hellfire turn the Warlock into the best duo farming class in the game.
---
It's really telling to see that he had a big ol grin on his face the entire duration of the video compared to his other videos where he's healing M+ for a third of the time.
---
Big true
---
They have the database. They didn't directly say that they have all the scripts.
---
Will that weapon swing timer work for auto shot on hunter?
---
This seems blizzlike in all ways except for the absolute smoothness and speed at which it was performed. If you have hunters being able to feign trap and not even notice them stop walking, or a mage being able to press a button and iceblock/uniceblock in a similar fashion it could have wide reaching implications, even old pvp videos of mages with the macrod iceblock that fades before GCD is ready are in the iceblock for *some* time. Who knows, well see.

In higher end raiding guilds debuffs are prio'd for maximum efficiency. This is done before the raid and everyone will be assigned their specific curses/debuffs.

The very first quest is "go see your class trainer" and is race locked, iirc.
---
It's a meme and not viable as in you won't be competing on the dps meters.
---
Yeah, can't have them playing by themselves. But seriously, a streamer isn't relying on luck to get into beta.
---
 Patch 4.3.0 (2011-11-29): Polymorph will now longer be able to be applied to a creature currently engaged in battle with a player outside of your own party.
---
&gt; We have better internet and knowledge now
---
We do. Healers don't dps in classic wow.
---
On a side note is blizzard monitoring/taking feedback on dungeon/world elites doing very low damage? I don’t think it’s a bug but still a big deal.
---
Hi Kaivax!  I remember being able to help people out of sticky situations with a clutch sheep, regardless of mobs being tagged, for all of my vanilla leveling.  I know with 1.12 polymorph was changed so that when you left a battleground it would fade instead of wandering around the battlemaster as a sheep but looking at the patch notes again I don't see any reference to sheep being affected by mobs being tagged.  Can you point us to when that change occurred?
---
Gold subscription counts for beta invite?
---
They's a shield in Naxx. https://classicdb.ch/?item=23075
---
I needs it. That shield is the goat.
---
id love to have helped test and find bugs.  but im not paying $15 to reactivate my account just for that chance. 
---
i wish they would have given those of us who had accounts from back than up till at least cata would get a chance regardless if we still had active subs or not. 
---
i was really hoping for the chance to help find issues, really hoping this launch goes super smooth!   seems like it will though with the fact the increasing beta test pool size is having no effect on stability (that ive seen nobody complaining about crashes or server issues)
---
i no lifed it for almost 5 years. missed a lot of real life i wish i could get back.   
---
Definitely learned my lesson the hard way.
---
The lesson I learnt a long time ago is, if you like a YouTube channel that's mostly planned, edited content, then don't watch their streams.
---
They are always completely different. In the cases ive watched the people were incredibly toxic, or boring as shit.
---
The only time I've been able to transition to livestreams from a YouTuber was when their YouTube content was mostly unedited, unscripted content anyway.
---
I wish Guild Wars 2 was more like the first game. I was honestly disappointed how different it ended up.
---
TBC prepatch had skirmishes iirc, but arena season 1 is TBC.
---
I don’t understand why this is a contentious issue. Making streamer-Free servers doesn’t effect streamers, their followers, or people who are indifferent; but it makes all the difference to those of us who *do* care. It’s such an easy thing to do that I think will make a lot of people happy, but whenever I mention it I’m met with “ur just jealous stop crying”...
---
thanks for this confirmation
---
Yea but spreading all the content of vanilla and tbc should last them 3.5 to 4 years? As it did originally (you can even take extra time for vanilla naxx). I understand what you mean, and vanilla + tbc was meant as a content estimate to get to the 5 year cycle. I think in the context of this hypothesis 5 years is an ideal length to strive for. And that should mean that not everyone should have cleared everything but also not just them either.
---
We all knew that Blizzard was lying to our faces when they claimed that the old 1.12 codebase was completely gone and unrecoverable.  What kind of gaming company doesn't archive their own code, no matter how old it is?!  It was a very transparent way of Blizzard telling us to fuck off or play retail.
---
But I suppose we're all so happy about Classic's August release, we're willing to forgive them for spitting in our faces like that.
---
You lost when you said warrior is the best dps.

Will there be 1 lock that gets to apply corruption and/or agony and/or immolate? Or is there a place where I can read about the most valuable debuffs?
---
No email received. I opened my bnet launcher and it was in my region tab selector
---
AFAIK yes, the gong-ringer and everyone who could ring the gong in a 24-hour-window after that got the mount, but don't quote me on that, I didn't play back then.  
---
I certainly agree with you on the raiding aspect, though.  
---
My own personal concern would be what could happen if a servers population is built around a streamers fanbase and then that streamer stops playing the game, although there obviously is the question whether or not that population would be that amazing to begin with, if they are only around because of one person.
---
Why would Blizzard be lying about what's accurate and what isn't? What would ever be the point of that?
---
Lmfao no. Well idk. I just meant vanilla as in original with no changes.
---
I received no emails. I did receive a phishing email this morning though about beta.
---
crying over having to pay for a chance to play a beta
---
omg.
---
What is "reference client" anyway? 1.12 client is publicly available. They have some sort of working 1.12 client + server combination, but I think they've never provided the details on what that server is, what code it runs (can't be pure old code, it would probably not compile with 2019 OS/DB system).
---
That guy is like the Daenerys of Azeroth.
---
I mean it's still the nelf model/skeleton.
---
I’ve had my account since 07 and I’m actively subbed. Idk if that even qualifies me at this stage but I’m dying to play it

I did make it about halfway up the gates before falling and then trying this so I’m sure you can still do that one

---
Seems like if this was a 1.12 change it would be in the patch notes. I can't seem to find it though.
---
Good find, wonder why did they change it between 1.12 and 4.3...
---
Did you get an e-mail too mate?
---
How is saying that Blizzard, who once again HAS A WORKING 1.12 CLIENT, knows if something is a bug or not defending them? Wtf?
---
I don't defend Blizzard when they mess up (most of BFA and other games), but how is saying that they have the ultimate proof whether or not something is a bug is me defending them?
---
Why are you people so intent on hating Blizzard and second guessing everything they do? Just don't play the game.
---
It is simple. They know better than you and every single person on this subreddit what is/is not 1.12.
---
Simple as that.
---
I heard that if you just yell really loud on classicwow reddit blizzard devs will hear it and consider your idea
---
How tho? Could you dm me in that matter? I just tried to do that too but got a message that the download is to big. Would be great if you could help me out
---
Fast run speed from cheetah and strong pet helps with outdoor farms.
---
Maraudon can be done by hunter and warlock, hunter is faster though and can feign death in case of accidental pulls (worm packs can be a bit rng). 
---
DM N tribute can only be done by hunters if at all in classic and is the most lucrative farm in the game

Even the higher level tiers are great! Had a 19 rogue ofc which turned into a 39 in tbc. A 49 shaman, 19 hunter, 39 lock. Personally it was the most fun I had in the game, didn’t have the time for hardcore raiding.

Late to the party here but

I like to think that it's what made a lot of Blizzard games great. Like Diablo 2 versus Diablo 3. D2 would take ages to get to high levels and there was a lot to do anyway. D3 is, after finally having reached a decent state, still just about rushing to max level, get BiS gear, die of boredom and return in 4 months
---
&gt; The major issue with modern day “LFG” is the teleportation to the dungeon.
---
It's teleporting to the dungeon and crossrealm that are the issue.
---
It looks like there will be global channels which is great because if there is one thing I never want to do ever again is spend an hour in trade chat in a city trying to form a group while afk.

Pretty sure flying was originally for level 69 though?

I just to point out. I made a couple comments about these things and got downvoted by angry people who dont understand how retail is different than private servers.
---
Thank you for posting this. Its infuriating when you try to explain something to someone. And they throw a tantrum because the world isnt how they want it to be.
---
Especially a lot of the streamers and youtubers who have been making bullshit guide videos with some of the things on this list....like sit crits.
---
F off. Thanks
---
This is what was so fun about pvp back then. I remember trying to level up in tarren mill and there would always be a couple of 60 alliance rogues camping the flight master one shorting lowboys. Then, when enough people started to die they would call guild mates and the war started. Also, when you felt pity for the enemy and didn’t kill them, only to have them wait for you to engage mobs and then try to kill you, really enforced the red = dead gameplay. I’m looking forward to classic for sure
---
Who has ever said that? They have a beta for a reason. Nice strawman you're punching there.
---
OSRS is still making new content though
---
My biggest problem is I had never really played a private server...I've been virtually vanilla-less since vanilla...I tried out ND last week and now I cant stop...I'm normally pretty patient but 3 months is such a long time :(
---
Not even close to the bad UIs
---
Or maybe just maybe it was something that was added at another point in time and then potentially reverted? Vanilla and TBC were full of undocumented changes, even retail has a ton of them.
---
How sad is it that you hate Blizzard so much that you went through every patch up to 4.3 to find something to "disprove" them.
---
There has to be something better you can do with your life.
---
Yikes.
---
Ah, perhaps. I just wanted to provide some insight about how to "keep the game going" beyond their current roadmap and how to avoid stagnation and also bloating.
---
Thanks, I think that's confirmation that you don't need BFA
---
Among with rogue, they scale indefinitely better than any other class for dps. Mainly because they dont need mana so they can go ham forever on a raid boss

This "peasant" used to raid at a sub world 75 level. You think just because you're an old school player you're hot shit, mate? Get over yourself.

This will 100% be a thing. And I dont mind.
---
&gt; Or is this something that is too core to gameplay to be buffed?
---
It is as it would require manipulating the data from 1.12.1 which they have said on multiple occasions is something they don't want to do.
---
Blizz has said any and all old glitches/bugs that don’t break the game are being left in.
---
That’s actually why I’m trying some of these out, because if a glitch worked back in 1.12 but it doesn’t in classic, that’s actually a bug lol.

So much misinformation. Now even more people are going against what we're saying because apparently it's not a bug.
---
You just made my point. They're normal players who just happen to stream. They have no control over anything other than being the raid leader. They're not special. These events happen ALL the time in vanilla.
---
Actually in classic druids can't drink potions in forms at all
---
Warlocks can farm exactly the same DME flowers as mages. It's slower but not like 3 times slower.
---
I don't think ease of gold farming should be such a factor. You're enjoying warlock more, money can't buy it.
---
Seriously, once I get to instance levels...like 18 and beyond. I treat every level as a quest to get BIS. 
---
Im a dangerous mo fuckin level 43 priest.
---
&gt; I doubt they will split their playerbase up that much, or do you think they would have a version of WoW for every wow expansion be playable? Doesn't seem feasible to me to split the playerbase into 3, or 4 or 7.
---
I think it was just a philosophical problem that Blizzard often gets caught up on. That was one of the major arguments against Classic happening, and now here we are and it's not an issue at all. Some play one, some play the other, many play both. It's a complete non-issue. Other MMOs and PS have shown servers are completely fine to play on with 'just' 10,000k active players. With an active player base of 3 million people across WoW, supporting 4 versions (modern/Classic Vanilla/Classic TBC/Classic Wrath) player wise wouldn't be an issue at all.
---
A lot are like that but Swifty ain’t that bad. He was just responding to chat and died, he didn’t actually forgot what game he was playing.
---
Yea I'm sure your message will get to those people on this subreddit, and it's not just feel good karma farming.
---
There are no winners here.
---
I didn't read the whole text OP made but I was disappointed as well how Blizzard manages beta invites. I start by saying that I as well wanted to get in but I've understood that I never will before the real launch.
---
There's been lack of information on how many beta accesses will be out there and how realistic it is to get an invite if you subscribe now as a veteran, someone completely new to franchise or someone else who hasn't played last few expansions.
---
Think it at Bob's perspective who played last at the beginning of Cataclysm. He doesn't know whether he gets in this month, next one or ever and he's stuck in old world. He either has to suck it and wait or play through the content and perhaps even buy BFA while waiting. It's free money from Bob who hadn't payed for them for years now and all it took from Blizzard was to ask subscribe for a chance and be quiet about details.
---
If they only wanted that beta testers should pay subscription while playing then they could have selected players from opt in for classic demo (which became available just now) and let them confirm the access by subscribing. If player didn't do that then after a few days the invite would have been given to next one.
---
Defend all you want but Blizzard is laughing for both of us all the way to the bank.
---
Yes, but OSRS was growing, even before content patches. 
---
The new content of OSRS isn't directly vertical in it's progression, either.
---
Once a day? What kind of training regiment is that? Brosplit?
---
Then be prepared for content to be steam rolled more than private servers. Which means classic will only die faster.
---
Agreed my friend

Logan Paul has no problem staying popular doing dumb annoying shit. Popularity isn't always correlated with being a decent person.
---
Hope you get a beta invite. This is good. :)
---
Yes, because I really care about virtual backpats. 
---
They're the most important thing in my life.
---
Totem buff is not a function then? Thats kinda wierd game design because it should loop over all stoneskin totems and apply buff to close players every frame.
---
Stop circle jerking.
---
Probably related to spell batching.  Should be fixable.
---
yeah, doesnt matter too much if your raiding casually.
---
yes, in more serious guilds its important to manage who is allowed to use which spells. There are a lot of important debuffs like sunder armor, damage amplifications, armor reductions, curses etc you want on the boss at all times
---
You're right and quite frankly I'm embarrassed I had to stoop to his level. I'd imagine the guy is in his mid 30's or early 40's. Pathetic really...
---
The biggest problem with modern WoW is the game systems in place, not the things like raids and quests. If they keep the same style of classic and introduce stuff like karazhan or emerald dream which were scrapped for Bc
---
While OP is kind of being an antagonistic whinger, the devs said that this is working as they intend it to. Its certainly a change from how it worked in Classic.
---
I think it’s called Classic but I’m not sure
---
This but somewhat unironically
---
07 here too, didn't get in either... yet!
---
Added summoning ability in the 2.01 pre-launch patch. Wasn't EXACTLY with TBC, but was damn close, still technically vanilla. Had to kick my brain into shape, it's been so long.
---
Sit crit is a bug? Thought that was intentional.
---
The reason it is quicker than it was in Vanilla is because sometime in TBC the /cancelform command was brought client side. This was still possible in Vanilla the delay was much more pronounced though. The mechanic is Vanilla the lack of any delay is not.
---
See [here](https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=128407.2) for a discussion on it. I'm still looking for the patch notes.
---
Where is that in the patch notes for 4.3.0? I don't see it in the official notes. 
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_4.3.0
---
I tried searching on Google for what you pasted and it has no results.
---
Damn, I would try to feel embarrassed but apparently everyone else in the world forgot how it worked in 1.12 as well.
---
&gt;  true vanilla difficulty
---
You are very welcome to provide evidence of time as that would be a great help. So far all evidence (old 2004-2006 videos) in regards to the damage of mobs and elite mobs have proven that the values are correct on alliance characters.
---
I remember being griefed in TBC by a warlock that was banishing mobs i was attacking. TBC was later than 1.12, sooooo.....
---
Polymorph did not work like this in 1.12, why are you lying?
---
He does make pretty good use of the space he does have at least!
---
Yeah man I really enjoy it too (: you gonna be making some in vanilla?
---
Snow + Owlbeasts.
---
I plan to use a threat meter and perhaps a loot table database that has item vendor prices too. The one I used in WotLK was called Atlas Loot.
---
Your comment would be a lot more impressive if you made it *before* the blue posted.
---
Oh look at this, these are some good mental gymnastics,  you are even going into conspiracy theories so you can defend blizzard ?
---
 Sad lol? im not the one coming up with excuses to defend incompetence.
---
Tell him that. If you think Beta was gonna be 100% accurate then you might actually be special. There’s a reason we are testing it right now and changes are happening almost every day.
---
It’s because everything else is already fucked. 16 debuffs, updated classes and talents, updated itemization. The whole thing is fucked for PVE anyway. I’m trying to change my mentality to just think about cthun and Naxx. Everything else will literally be one shot by even average or shitty players
---
That shit happened regularly on fresh pservers noob
---
There’s a lot of things that are different from classic. This never was going to be 100% exact copy. There’s gonna be changes.
---
If any more of us NA fucks get in pls make a post I NEED TO KNOW
---
Not sure why you're getting flamed by others here with this post. I think it's quite endearing and I'm right there with you. I started in '05 during Vanilla and have at least tried every expansion since then. I never stick around on those.
---
I agree that it will be a hell of a ride, and I'm right where your buddy is at. Here's to August 27th my man. 
---
Cheers my fellow lad.
---
Look at the Blizzard forums, click on any of the posts, they're all in caps.
---
I had the same issue, I'll DM you link I followed. However it did cost me $5 to buy Mega.nz to DL it. 100% worth IMO
---
Ain't nothing wrong with a thicc priest
---
I have yet to enter a subreddit that didn't have atleast a middle of the road level of toxicity. It's the nature of reddit honestly. If someone comes to this subreddit and is turned off by this amount of reddit they haven't been on reddit for long
---
Man it is a good thing that this is about polymorph and not banish, also, how do you know it wasn't reverted at some point and then changed back?
---
Jesus christ you people.
---
I begged my parents for dial up but they would never gone for it due to it tying up the phones. Instead we got sayilite internet, which in rural Washington, resulted in ON A GOOD DAY 10,000 latency. Usually it was between 15,000 and 21,000. Me and my brother played on the same priest and we got an addon called quartz that told us when we could hit the key to begin a second cast. To this day I think that is what caused me to be such a great healer, having to predict when tanks would take massive damage and having to mentally prepare 10 seconds before they needed the heal.
---
That's not in the patch notes for 4.3. Either the official ones, mirrored posts on other websites, or in undocumented changes.
---
Soooo... Fake news? (I've always wanted to say that)
---
This is not the blizzard forums. Click on the giant “reddit” icon at the top and you will notice that you are indeed on Reddit. Where post titles are not automatically in caps.
---
Thing is, it seems to be a bug but Blizz say it's not a bug at all.
---
It doesn’t matter when your account was made it is all random. They may have focused 2005 accounts in the very beginning but it doesn’t guarantee anything.
---
Beast
---
uh... lol.
---
:D
---
Then it isn’t a bug. They said it’s intended so it is. Move on.
---
You know, I only just now realized after 15 years... that dragon is getting shot in the dick.
---
&gt;Then be prepared for content to be steam rolled more than private servers.
---
I've been ready for this for some time now. I want classic after all. If you want harder content I guess you could try and ask Blizzard for hardmode realms or something after the normal realms have launches in August.
---
Yeah, the Mega i tried as well, but i am not going to pay 5 bucks for 200 missing MB. I am actually quite poor so i can not even afford that but thanks for your reply :)
---
I am the one going into conspiracy theories to defend Blizzard?
---
They have A WORKING CLIENT OF THE GAME YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. They know what is a bug and what is not.
---
But no no no no no, YOUR 15 year old memory is correct above all else.
---
Dude, you. went. through. years. of. patch. notes. You did this just to "prove" Blizzard wrong. That is sad.
---
I would caution you not to choose a class simply because of "less competition for gear". I answered your question as best I could, but I believe the question itself is founded on a flawed premise that the goal of raiding is to personally gather gear faster.
---
Good raiding guilds are communist. They share all value in their labor for the betterment of the society and thus, as part of the society, better themselves. When your raidmate gets gear, that means that *you* got gear, because the gear they got will allow you, and the rest of your guild, to progress faster and smoother. This is why Loot Council is a superior gearing setup compared to DKP, because DKP facilitates backroom dealing, oneupsmanship, and shortsightedness.
---
So with that in mind, you should view raiding not as a way to make yourself better faster, but instead to make your *guild* better faster, since the former strategy is self-serving, while the latter both creates a better gaming environment *and* means that you too will be gearing quickly. There's plenty of time to accumulate gear throughout the expected lifespan of Classic. View it as secondary to both personal enjoyment and friendship-building. To that end, choose a class you *enjoy* playing, as opposed to one you think will get you faster gear. Not only will you want to play a class you enjoy more often than one you feel you were obliged to play, but you'll also feel less slighted when you *inevitably* don't get first dibs on some particular piece of gear you really wanted. If you do like Rogue as a class, then by all means play it. But please don't select your class just because you think that the end goal is to gear them super fast. The gear will come in time no matter what, but you won't burn out or turn jealous if you were already having fun without that gear.
---
Where are you seeing this? I can find it nowhere. Patch notes from 3.2 - 8.1 are all easily accessible on battle.net
---
There's no way runecape has the most subs in it's entire history. There used to be full servers pretty much 16 hours of the day back in 2006. 
---
Lots of f2p people maybe, but that's more valuable than these members.
---
I spy that moo macro that every Tauren has.
---
True, at first it only seemed like it was vanilla accounts but seems now more recent accounts have gotten invited. But I doubt I'll get a invite. Never gotten one before. Not even for bfa
---
Where did they say that? I saw there were people reporting on it as a bug, but I didn't see a Dev response that it was intentional.
---
I think if enough people complain they will end up changing elite damage anyways. More and more posts are being made by people about it.
---
Okay, that makes perfect sense. Thanks for the information!
---
this is vanilla, they dont have trinket racial here
---
That sounds about how I remember it, lots of greens, just never the ones that would be good for you
---
I'm not saying anyone is lying, but it might've been a mistake or misunderstanding.
---
Accidentally pulling two yellow mobs and dying. Having spirit on low level mail gear. Having to decide which talent in a given tier is the least shitty. Westfall having no chat channels.
---
The hybrid tax exists because it would be stupid to have a class that excels in everything. Every class in the base game is payable. Which is fine for me.
---
So wait, wait, wait.
---
You think it is different than how it worked in 1.12 (not talking about any other patch) but you won't take ACTUAL PROOF that it did not work?
---
I don't understand you people. It literally did not work in 1.12. Simple as that.
---
Could it have worked in 1.8, 1.5, 1.11? Sure, but it did not work in 1.12.
---
I'll be leveling as Alliance on a NA (probably PVE) server if you want to join me!
---
Ah. Thanks for the response. That's apparently a pretty new comment that I didn't see.
---
But still, that's not the community saying Blizzard can do no wrong. That's Blizzard deciding by fiat to do something wrong.
---
Yeah, if Blizzard is gonna pull stuff like this, then I want Dual-Spec, LFG, Guild Banks, Summoning Stones, Achivements, Mage Tables, Soulwell, Raid-wide Auras, WoW Armory, Mobile Auction House, Barbershop, New Graphics &amp; Animations, Heirlooms, etc.
---
Yeah quitting after Wrath was a smart choice for your friend. I lingered in and out for every expac after, except BfA, but Vanilla, BC, and Wrath are all amazing and provide different shades of the WoW MMORPG experience.
---
Stop jerking.

Fine then. If the banish also doesn't work on tagged mobs, then they are probably lying.

The beta is completely free. The catch is that you only get a chance to get invited to the free beta if you have a current subscription. So technically it’s free but technically it’s not. It’s like everything that’s advertised as “FREE” in life, there’s almost always a catch.
---
as president trump would call it: fake news
---
Initial comments were they were using the current engine, since it removes some of the "creative" api use that allowed for auto abilities and one button macros.
---
Some people put too much stock into karma, and project that onto others. So any genuine post can be seen as whoring in their eyes. Don’t mind it lol, that’s one of the downsides of the reddit upvote/downvote system, but at least it’s not YouTube comments.
---
The world is huge and things have changed. Im sure you will come across some things

This wasn't added until Cata... I really hope the NAB thread doesn't start getting cluttered with things that are actually bugs
---
For my rogue i will start with mining and skinning. Ill vendor all leather up to rugged, which ill sell on AH. Skinning is also useful for having someone craft decent gear along the way. Once I'm good on crafts at 60, Ill drop skinning and pick up engineering.
---
Which ones which?
---
Tyrael pet or gtfo
---
No....no you don't...you have a client, but you don't have the database and everything else.
---
Emulations are not real working 1.12 clients/servers.
---
Christ, it’s not that different, you’re acting like they are oceans apart and that all pserver players belong in a toxic cesspool.
---
Most /sit guides for Enrage are just general warrior guides like Kargoz, he made no claim that it would be a 100% feature in classic.
---
I just want to play :(
---
I just stayed up way too late getting my char to level 10
---
But if the layer you're on reaches the cap, someone is getting layered
---
Play the other faction.  If you have played them both, play a class you haven't.  If you have, play without looking anything up, or without using any sort of mod that provides guidance.  No loot tables, no map arrows.  Play on an RP realm.  Play the character, not the game.
---
So when Blizzard adds Dual-Spec, LFG, Guild Banks, Summoning Stones, Achivements, Mage Tables, Soulwell, Raid-wide Auras, WoW Armory, Mobile Auction House, Barbershop, New Graphics &amp; Animations, Heirlooms, Sub Tokens, etc
---
Are you just gonna say "move on"?
---
Uh lol what?
---
If you don't trust Blizzard even after they confirm something is a bug or not, when they are the ONLY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD who have a working 1.12 server/client (as it was)...then why even play the game?
---
Lmao u think there was flying on lvl58 on tbc, cute. Lol
---
They already helped bringing classic to Blizzard attention despise what haters say. Its always big publicity
---
I started playing Vanilla at 1024x768 on my Mag Innovisions 19" monitor.  Always seemed like I had plenty of real estate.  Then I got my first LCD monitor during TBC (23" diagonal) and it felt like a whole new world opened up.
---
There are only 2 beta servers, both NA, everyone around the world plays on those 2, one pve, one pvp.
---
So is this just another "waaaah it's not like this on my pserver" thing? Lots of people saying it's wrong with no evidence so far.

That is the claim that Jagex made in January. 
---
You have to take into account the amount of bots the game had back then, as well as gold farmers. 
---
Gold farmers, while they're still around, aren't nearly as plentiful, due to detection algorithms, and the inclusion of Bonds. 
---
Bot detection software has greatly improved, and, again, yes, there are still bots in the game, but not to the extent that they once were.
---
Jesus Christ that’s a slippery slope.

---
If they are inaccurate then yes. If not then no not in a million years. At least not as launch content because as they have already said after the last phase they are open for suggestions as to what should happen.
---
Influencers, because you can't decide for yourself?
---
You and I both, friend. I am counting the days
---
You mean except for the fact that they just released a comment that there were in fact a bug with shamans Stoneskin totem giving permanent damage reduction?
---
Yeah I can only see as far back as 2012 but I know for sure I made my account during WotLK.. odd.

---
Most are just stupid NPCs who don't think. Companies know their habbits way too well and knows how to milk every single penny without them noticing. Pay for a chance? How fitting for a studio that loves rng and lottery in their current games. It's yet another lootbox and the details about chances aren't out there. I can't wait for game industry to get regulated.
---
Great work!
---
Stop making patch notes up.
---
You do. I macroed my feign death and icetrap to be instantaneous
---
If all of Vanilla and TBC was released at once it would have been completely cleared in months by the heaviest players. Not all or even most, but enough that there would be enough complaints about lack of content in public forums for it to be noticeable.
---
Vanilla WoW had longevity because of how most players played it, not because of the minimum length of the content. Most players explored the world and enjoyed the journey to some extent but there were many players that were capped out at 60 the first month the game was out. 
---
Some people want to rush to the "end" as fast as possible and nothing will ever stop that. A slow feed of content is the only way to hold that off. And even that leads to complaints about short content releases. It is a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation for developers.
---
No he is making patch notes up.
---
They cannot compete with Rogues when it comes to single point DPS, just can’t. They will be high but if your rogues are not topping the charts then you need new rogues.
---
Maybe it's just me, but trying to back out of that page redirected me to a somewhat obtrusive ad.
---
We’re the minority here though. And we were pretty united on loot trading, so we made a big impact there. But I don’t think we’re as united on changing values of the original game, especially this far into development. 
---
5-mans will be challenging for what they are, but I’m waiting for TBC for the real hair-pulling 5-man stress. Being mind numbingly hard isnt what Classic is about.

---
Oh lol I was about to become a hardcore vanilla mtn dew drinker 😂
---
You were indeed able to sheep anyones mob in vanilla. 
---
However it's entirely possible that blizzard will remove this, and go with the 4.3 version because of griefing. Say what you want about this, it's seems pretty clear that blizzard is trying to limit the amount of report action that players will do, because they will be using automated customer support, instead of paying employees. Removing the ability to grief with sheeping is basically the same as loot trading and right click report. I don't support it, but on the other hand, just don't be a dick and it shouldn't affect you.
---
&gt; Blizzard doesn’t let you sheep tagged mobs so that means dual spec should be allowed

Yes. If they're adding in things from Cataclysm, they should add other things too.

I'll give you an example, I played on Magtheridon EU back in TBC, its the server Nihilum was on. In fact, me being on that server is actually one of the reasons that can be seen as how streamers will ruin servers.
---
All my friends wanted to play on Magtheridon EU because Nihilum was on it. Every time Kunged logged on, 100s of people would just surround him in Orgrimmar on low level alts causing server queues.
---
Now this example is of a raid leader of a popular guild that showed up in a major city for 15-20 minutes. Now imagine that, with streamers that play for several hours a day, always having their location public so people can follow them around and arguably (in some cases) an even larger following. 
---
And this is just one aspect of it. Streamers do bring some good too I guess, such as events (pvp and pve). They're just much easier to organize for streamers. However, to most people the bad definitely outweighs the good.
---
again, he debuffs so not a form
---
Haha we’ll see, I’m going try and raid with a bit more commitment this time around. if that falls through I know where all my extra gold is going
---
They will be a must in MC for tranq shot
---
Don't try man. I am being downvoted for saying the same thing. People want to believe what they want to believe. Their memories (\*cough\* private servers \*cough\*) can't be wrong.
---

---

---

---
As far as I can tell it's pve because they want pve casuals to experience the war without doing pvp. Which is dumb.
---
I’m similar to you and began playing end of 2008 so I’ll be playing classic as my first experience of vanilla. I’m looking forward to it because it’ll be totally different to what we have now.
---
Lux Eterna - requiem for a dream. Dunno why but was brilliant to clear my head and totally focus on raid i was doing.
---
Are you the BK foot lettuce guy
---
This kinda makes me think they should not add battle grounds to the game.
---
That has nothing to do with mob damage. That has to do with a stoneskin bug. It isn't the mob damage itself.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFykmSbwovQ
---
from one of those exploration movies
---
They stated that when it comes to mods and macros they don't want automation.
---
I'm going to go out on a short limb and say that extends to classic.
---
i was agreeing with you that they are useless
---
Yes, it would.  https://youtu.be/_RRJFvaCAl4
---
Part of what has been hyping me is the cross-over of pserver people and retail people. Yesterday on the beta already had a ton of that. Like sony and venruki screaming to kill monkeynews.
---
"Sick duel" but multiple misplays
---
So given by your posts here it is pretty clear you don't understand a lot of things, including what 'client' and 'server' mean. The 1.12 CLIENT is public and widely available. What isn't public and widely available is the 1.12 back-end (i.e. server) data.
---
There are multiple features of the classic beta that are \*NOT\* like original 1.12.  This is expected... in fact that is one of the main reasons for the beta: to source out disparities between original 1.12 and the emulated 1.12 that is the wow classic beta so they can be rectified. People searching for evidence of what 1.12 was like is important and integral to this entire beta testing process. Going by word of mouth or memory doesn't really help anyone. Faith doesn't work for everyone, but glad it works so well for you!
---
"sick"

Breaking me down got me in to Soil, and i just love Halo!

This is quite literally fake news.

&gt; I’m waiting for TBC for the real hair-pulling 5-man stress.
---
I'm on the same page with you there. I want Classic and TBC for different reasons and difficulty is not why I want to play Classic.
---
Dungeon io.....can they fucking not, we don't need that shit in Classic.
---
I love how OSRS and Classic are the new main games, well back to the new main games. And by that I mean this: when you ask someone if they play runescape you’re clearly talking about OSRS, same way when classic comes out, if you ask someone if they play wow, you’re clearly talking about classic. RS3 is complete shit and so is BfA. When classic is released it will be the same thing as how runescape is now; someone asks if they play runescape and they say “yea i play rs3” you reply “oh i’m talking about real runescape, not that new bullshit”  REAL wow is back &lt;3
---
Ye I must admit I forgot about the OP quite quickly :)
---
You're still wrong IMO. There is likely to be like 10 furys and like 7 rogues (and 3-4 hunters) in a raid. And you overestimate the amount of rogue-specific non-tier pieces.
---
Polymorph and Banish griefing were very much a thing all the way through until Cata.
---
Calling it destro is a bit misleading. It's 2 different hybrid specs, of either affliction+desto or demonology+desto. But your playstyle will be putting up your assigned curse(elements, shadows or recklessness), and then casting shadowbolts. Occasionally as a affi+destro lock you can use corruption, and corruption has a small chance to give you an instant shadowbolt. But yeah, raiding is basically spamming shadowbolt from MC till naxx.
---
Oh dude me too I love a bunch of Soil songs and I mainly listen to them when I'm pvping on my warrior!
---
That's a good idea. I've always played hunter n rogue. Maybe I'll try druid or shammy
---
Pretty much this whole sub at the moment. Clearly their 15 year old memories cannot be wrong...see my downvotes.
---
A damage reduction stat has nothing to do with the damage dealt by a mob? Damn, I could've used you in court.
---
Hopefully she'll let you have your fun though. I'm lucky enough to have a gamer girlfriend who wants to level through it with me
---
Its a "new" blizzard game ofc there is still a lot of people interested, aton of people also watch BFA streams when that was launched... Wait with your judgements for at least 3 months after release and see if the numbers hold up...
---
Yeah, just watching him on Allcraft and seeing his persona on his stream, its like two different people. But hey, his streaming personality is what gets him 10k+ viewers, cant deny the hustle eventhough it feels like a double-edged sword.
---
No. It is that different. Evident by this blue post.
---
These people did make claims. They made guides to prepare for classic and legit thought this was how it worked.
---
And yes. Most private server players who complain classic is different than their private server are toxic.
---
Since the code is wrong on private servers. Everything is wrong. Every damage value. Every crit. Every item dropped. Its all wrong. Its just not retail.
---
Highly unlikely they will main holy while levelling - but not yet.
---
Fantastic
---
Thanks for the Vindication.
---
What I said is still true :)
---
Guild Wars 1 was my first MMO, and I think I was 7 or 8 at the time. My family only really played it for 6 months or so before we swapped to WoW. GW2 was such a disappointment to me. The dynamic mechanics felt pointless and inconsequential. The cities felt empty. I’d have rather gotten a revamped GW1. It’d be such a trip to play that game again.
---
I personally started in the burning crusade and I'm excited for classic to come out I now get to experience the game in a way that I missed out on and that alone makes me excited for classic
---
OMG YESSSS
---
Hi, /u/Sylvanas_only
---
Yeah I understand, it's just that I was struggling to decide between mage and rouge, and this tipped the scales. But if I find rouge boring, i'll quit them and make a new char as a different class, ofc.
---
Sheeping other peoples mobs WAS possible in vanilla though, it was changed later in patch 4.3
---
My bad, my sarcasm filter is broken today, hazard of being I.T.
---
Orc warlock baby !
---
Guess we’ll see in the coming months.
---
That was literally always going to happen.
---
holy shit, 20/10.
---
Regardless, I think they will have more than 30k players trying to play at once on launch day. 100k people were watching Asmongold run Deadmines the 9ther day.
---
Don't forget to play with Blizzards balls while your down there lol
---
&gt; Especially since they haven't released a good game since sc2 
---
Totally off-topic, but you have no idea how refreshing it is for me to hear someone say this. I *love* SC2. You know who does not seem to like SC2? SC2 players! Every space I inhabited for community associated with that game seemed to be filled with people talking about how it was a dead game and that it was a no-skill, unbalanced, boring game with no future. 
---
Blergh...
---
NA PVP Horde
---
LF guild that will be raiding either Fri, Sat, or Sun between the times 8AM - 6PM EST
---
Veteran vanilla raider looking to priest please PM
---
Only bug i want to exist still is the levitate bug. Can literally get anywhere with it.
---
Agreed, making the decision to change this interaction is one thing, but I think it's a bit disingenuous to lump this in with the other things listed in this thread.
---
I knew about the polymorph one, but I as for the diminishing returns, I am pretty sure you are right as well.
---
I can't remember when (tbc with arena?) but they made "official" diminishing returns 10 seconds, 6, 3, none, or whatever.
---
Drakova, but iirc irl hit him hard and he stopped making videos.
---
be the change you wish to see.

**&lt;CREW&gt; - EU – Horde - PvP Server – Mediumcore Raiding Guild - English**
---
CREW is a fresh guild preparing for Classic release, which means new members will be able to help shape the guild moving forward. It will be a casual/mediumcore raiding guild on a PvP server with a relaxing and friendly atmosphere.
---
We are currently 65 members in the CREW. 
---
For raiding, we are currently ONLY recruiting: Priest healer.
---
We are also absolutely looking for socials/non-raiders!
---
* Our overarching goal is that we want to create a relaxed environment where we can have fun and challenge ourselves. WoW is about having fun, and we want Classic to be as fun as possible.
---
* We want to see all of what Classic has to offer at our own pace.
---
* We want time to experience the leveling process (1-3 months).
---
* We want to be a part of the server community and experience World PvP, and hope to bond and form rivalries with other guilds on the server.
---
* We want to strike a middle ground between the casual and semi-hardcore raiding. We want to clear raids in our own decent pace.
---
* A friendly attitude and willingness to learn and improve.
---
* We expect raiders to have some cheap consumables (food and pots), and NOT 13+ expensive ones. We will make do with what we have.
---
* We expect raiders to do their best while in the actual raid, so we can overcome the challenges together.
---
**Core values**
---
* Bring the player, not the class/spec mentality. We allow less viable specs and encourage everyone to play what they like.
---
* Common sense and patience.
---
* Being flexible and understanding that real life takes priority.
---
* Honest and transparent leadership.
---
* A team mentality about raiding, with fair loot rules.
---
**Raid Schedule** (*Preliminary*)
---
2 raid days: Thursday and Sunday 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET).
---
If you are interested or have any questions please send me a message and we’ll talk:
---
Discord: Sindrex#4881
---
Wonder if Toweliee changed his mind too, he was also one of those hardliners.
---
Right and now its even worse.
---
I don't want in the BETA because I'll be burned out by release and not want to play at launch. I come in when it launches so I can experience the chaos
---
I think that's meant to be a demon hunter, as they were planned for vanilla, as we're death knights and necromancers. The warglaive, robe and blindfold suggest so anyway. Unless I'm not seeing the druid. This was probably just an image put together early in development that they kept using.
---
Sit crit is 100% intentional. Proccing enrage is a bug
---
oh snap you're right. 
---
Most op race: Orc :)
---
Little noises my first imp said “I don’t wanna!” “Do I have to?”
---
For shaman, I'd go tauren. I went orc at first and I regretted it at 60 when I saw how badass other enhancement shamans looked with a giant 2 hand unstoppable force. Plus gear looks bigger on them too, it just fits well. And a hybrid ele will have a shield on it and since you got war stomp, it could saved my ass so many times trying to heal myself or cast a chain lightning
---
Are Wow music videos okay too? Like, OC?
---
between 0-65536
---
&gt; Totem buff is not a function then? Thats kinda wierd game design because it should loop over all stoneskin totems and apply buff to close players every frame.
---
Couple issues with that suggestion. That would be terrible performance, and there are no "frames" on the server side. Most modern systems are event based, instead of looping through every object each tick. Sounds like the event to remove the buff was not firing correctly.
---
That's what I tought, he grouped with a tauren shaman just before
---
Mob damage was wrong in some instances. It was a bug with stoneskin totem.
---
Literally the first thing I saw when I opened up his stream was this: https://clips.twitch.tv/PricklyColorfulOysterLitty Noped and DansGame out of there.
---
Vanilla was exceedingly addictive due to the social groups you could form.  
---
Be careful you don't over do it!

What lovely nazca line art. :V It proves natives understood WoW before we did!
---
Dude...the mob isn't doing less damage, that damage is being mitigated more.
---
That is a completely different thing. The mob is still doing its normal (and 1.12) damage, but the bug was that stoneskin was a permanent effect therefore your char was taking less damage due to mitigation than you should be.
---
It is completely different thing.
---
won't be able to play paladin tank :(
---
Exactly, no gifts...on stream
---
Yeah it seems like he has no idea how to play the duel. He was casting arcane explosion...
---
"Clearly not enough. Classic WoW is going to die. It's all nostalgia still. Next goalpost please." - People in r/wow, probably

If your tl;dr is longer than the post in question you're doing something horribly, horribly wrong.
---
Pump it by black eyed peas..... My younger self used to play it when I entered the final section of uldaman because shit got real.
---
&gt; I assume this method is to get a larger amount of healing from a health potion because it heals you in human form before multiplying your hp back into bear form.
---
And from this I took it he thought he left bear form to get more hp while in fact he couldn't get 'more' hp since his only option was to power-shift and take a potion
---
Just looked into his Archived vids on YouTube. Thank you!
---
Easily [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMPpnCvCZvw).
---
I'm in this boat! Gave up on a lvl 49 rogue, started a 19 hunter with full fishing gear, 2x AGM, the works. 4th on my battlegroup to get the Battle Standard when those changes came through. Many good times were had.
---
But that wasn't mob damage. That was mitigation.
---
Mobs were still doing their right damage. It was just being mitigated more due to a bug.
---
Those are two different things. They may seem the same, but they are completely different.

"HUH!"

---
i once made the mistake in ignoring int for feral.  Having mana for heals/shapeshift is far more valuable than extra crit chance.  
---
I learned the hard way xD
---
You really dont. A lot of vanilla classes dont have that many abilities.
---
Is the stress test where they open up the beta to a lot more people all at once? When does the first one happen?
---
As a 19 hunter with Imp wingclip and silk bandages, I never had an issue with rogues, unless in the tightest of spaces. Warlocks, on the other hand
---
Imagine pretending that rudimentary lfg addons didnt exist in vanilla. These people who pretend to know anything about classic is cute.
---
I jumped on my pc just to put  these songs on because your comment got me hyped lmao
---
"Not enough mana." and the human male laughing. (Played lock)
---
What meaningful difference is there between "people are steamrolling the content" and "people are steamrolling the content a bit more"?
---
Yeah, mount and spell costs sneak up on you.
---
You can find all of the information about it [here!](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule)
---
Real men even eat it
---
auto-loot was its own keybind not a settings option back then. on PS you can open chests and not loot, so some people (including me) will link the contents and if anyone wants something they speak up and its all theirs.
---
to add to the random buffs: you might as well start working on your muscle memory to type "/wave". it's like in real-life, you'll run through major cities and quest hubs and go about your business but in rural areas youre far more polite to the strangers you run into. throw out a /wave, throw some dots on the mob their killing, or start a group for that boring quest chain
---
It's not "faith". They have the complete running package. I know exactly how it all works. I am saying that Blizzard...has EVERYTHING and everything running AS IT WAS.
---
Can there be bugs caused by back porting everything from the modern client? Of course. However, it would not affect things like this.
---
It isn't faith to believe Blizzard on whether something is a bug or not when they confirm it. I am not saying not to report things. In fact you SHOULD report it even if it is just a feeling or a memory. But to then go about DENYING Blizzard's words about whether or not something is working is absolutely insane.
---
That means if you get invited for Stress test then you're in for good. Nice.
---
I wrote this earlier about adding it:
---
&gt;You were indeed able to sheep anyones mob in vanilla.
---
However it's entirely possible that blizzard will remove this, and go with the 4.3 version because of griefing. Say what you want about this, it's seems pretty clear that blizzard is trying to limit the amount of report action that players will need, because they will be using automated customer support, instead of paying employees. Removing the ability to grief with sheeping is basically the same as loot trading and right click report. I don't support it, but on the other hand, just don't be a dick and it shouldn't affect you.
---
I like your downvote! Precisly how you're supposed to debate on Reddit!
---
Of course it is a "different" thing, but it is impossible to know if it's mob damage that is bugged or that there's an invisible damage mitigation when you do not know that there's an invisible permanent damage mitigation active on you. Is it not?
---
You're basically saying that their tests showed no discrepancies when they actually did, and once you realised that you're now saying it is completely different things. The result was the same, there was a discrepancy between vanilla mob damage and Classic mob damage.
---
Does that mean anyone can play the beta now ?
---
I do not believe that is what it means.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5sjX0tdHHY
---
its near gnomeregan
---
They should go lateral and not vertical after the end of classic. So instead of going the next 10 levels, you progress the game by adding new gear throughout the levels. You dont release any new expansion, but increase the level cap by 1 every 3-5 months instead. All the way till 70. Then you start adding new map content, but not a lot of it. The more spread out, the less populated the game becomes. So one area at a time. This being done with each new level.
---
getting crit when you sit is intended. Proccing any of the things that proc on being critically hit when you do is a bug.
---
Two weeks before launch you can make 3 characters.
---
You may not respond but I've done dozens of tests and Stoneskin simply isn't working. I've done it fully armored or naked on a wide variety of enemies and only two have actually had their damage reduced.
---
Stomp like putting all of them down at once? Totems are on the global cooldown in vanilla.
---
I'm a bit frustrated by it personally because I cannot raid because of my IRL schedule. But I much prefer Classic RPG elements over the Diablo 3 style current wow is so I'll just have to deal with it.
---
You nailed the problem on the head in your first paragraph. Not needing gear there vs. not having a reason to go at all
---
Hold on I’ll have to ask my dad
---
did you just get invited or were you already in and noticed the words change
---
Offering 300$ to rent an account for 3 weeks.
---
I think the leaks from months ago are going to be accurate, 8-12 servers a region
---
unfortunately that’s not what that means.
---
No, sorry.
---
Well for one people are literally chain pulling without stopping. Also why bring 5 people to a dungeon when you can bring less for more chances at loot and more xp? This will be the same for raids if they are that easy.
---
I thought during vanilla you couldn’t make opposing faction toons on the same server. Maybe they will implement that.
---
nope, still need to be invited.
---
I should have specified and written "dungeon and raid difficulty" but yes, the leveling difficulty compared to retail wow is something I'm looking forward to as well.
---
Nice, seems like there was something going on after all.
---
For additional testing, you might be interested in checking inspect range too. Inspecting should become available at 5.55yds [[Wowwiki](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=API_CheckInteractDistance&amp;oldid=87721).
---
Also, grats on beta.
---
I have been in for several days, and just saw the option change quite literally before my eyes lol
---
Hmm, il keep that in mind
---
He was OT in that run, IIRC, but the point still stands!
---
Has this been reported?
---
/friends -&gt; lua error
---
/who org -&gt; social panel pops up ok and can go to friends tab
---
This is the info I found, seems Polymorph, MC and Enslave Demon couldn't be cast on tapped targets in vanilla - https://classic.wowhead.com/spells?filter=75;1;0
---
That isn't what I am saying at all. I am saying there was numerous things of proof saying that numbers were right, far more than saying numbers were wrong.
---
I didn't say not to report things if you think they are wrong. But in this case there was a lot of proof showing numbers were normal for most people besides this one instance of video.
---
Its good that it was brought up and got attention cause it showed there was something wrong, but as said in various parts that there are more to mob damage than just mob damage. SO many people see just a number and it does "line up" that obviously its the mob damage.
---
It wasn't. It was another bug and anyone who said mob damage looked fine (referencing other videos and not necessarily the one in that post) was downvoted and said NO YOU ARE WRONG.
---
Oh wow thank you!
---
If players would see the same thing on the client as Blizzard do, then what could the mistake or misunderstanding be? I don't understand where this insane distrust comes from. Blizzard has every possible benefit to gain from having an accurate representation of vanilla, if they say something is correct then you have to trust that they've checked and double checked it on their reference client.
---
&gt; Also why bring 5 people to a dungeon when you can bring less for more chances at loot and more xp?
---
Faster completion time is a pretty big incentive to bring more people.
---
Sounds perfect. Me and a couple of friends are interested. Will keep a lookout for you guys.
---
&lt;Ghouls Gone Wild&gt; | OCE-PvP | Horde | Semi-Hardcore
---
Greetings! We from &lt;Ghouls Gone Wild&gt; truly hope that you are as excited as we are for the release of Classic World of Warcraft! To that end, we humbly invite you to join our newly formed guild in anticipation for the 27th of August release.
---
We strive to offer organised progression, whilst enabling those with busy schedules a chance to experience end game material. Our philosophy is; to meet likeminded people for social interaction, progress through raids and dominate battlegrounds/world PvP. 
---
Requirements: We are currently recruiting ALL classes and specs with a strong emphasis on your enjoyment (play what YOU want to play). We do ask that mature, honest and dedicated individuals need apply.
---
Raid Times: Thursday - 19.00 to 23.00 AEST 
---
                        Saturday - 09.00 to 13.00 AEST
---
We will start progression of MC on the 6th week following release, being Tuesday the 8th of October. Loot Council will be our method of distributing loot.
---
Aside from raiding, we wish to emphasise that you are more than welcome to join for a myriad of reasons. Levelling is one of the most rewarding aspects of Classic World of Warcraft, so we wish to enjoy and explore that together. Running dungeons on a nightly basis will be one of our top priorities throughout the life of Classic. 
---
PvP will also be on the forefront of our agenda. Battlegrounds are a great way to unwind after a busy day of work, especially when coupled with a beer and great bants. These will also be scheduled as to not leave anyone out who wishes to participate.
---
We inspire you to join our newly formed community, with the intention of building something amazing. If you have any questions regarding our guild, then please don't hesitate to contact myself or Moo on discord. Crazy#2348 or Daspectrum#1716 
---
Our Discord - https://discord.gg/yaRWuJm
---
That's a broad overestimate based on any stats I've ever seen. Warriors in total approximate about 10 people in a Raid, with around 3-5 being tanks. And if there are more Fury Warriors than that, they'll likely eat into Rogue numbers. Furthermore, Fury Warriors don't start off on as strong a footing, so except for guilds that are preplanning their raids (which are likely to be Loot Council and thus mooting the "competition" argument), Furies will be gradually phased in as the guild gears up. A guild of 10 Fury Warriors in greens is setting itself up for failure in early MC. Assuming a reasonably standard number of 13 healers and 4 tanks, that means that with your number estimates for AP classes, there would be a grand total of 3 full spots for all casters. And that's just not going to happen. Frost Mages are great in early raiding.
---
Not when the LFG addon hits...
---
Could you get a screenshot comparing the duel range, autoshot min range, and melee range? Similar to the ones in the first post.
---
Yeah i dug through the notes 3+ times, came to ask for a source and the comment was deleted lol
---
Amber - 311
---
You're right. The content is there. It's gameplay that's fucking trash and sucks. I feel miserable when I'm playing my DK or any of my alts. When classes are not fun, the content becomes not fun too. And if that content is boring shit like islands and warfronts, I don't even bother doing them now. The last two raids have been pretty good, but that's it. Literally the only good thing about BfA.
---
WoD didn't have content, but better gameplay. The classes were fun, we had PvP vendors. I'd say even the raids were more fun.
---
Personally as PvP player I had way more fun in WoD. Yes I said it.
---
And if I need to let's say take a vacation for a week or I have an accident or I'm simply not at home when the need occurs?
---
I believe Banish was the only effect like that that still worked on tagged mobs..everything else I do believe (poly confirmed) could not be casted on tagged mobs.
---
Good idea! If I can’t get into this beta then maybe I redo all the fun stuff that got me into this universe in the 1st place
---
Il keep that in mind
---
All around me - Flyleaf
---
Ah, well, sounds good, then. And if you ever decide to play a Rogue instead, they're also pretty fun. I never understand peoples' fascination with playing with makeup. ;)
---
whats the exploit? dont want to watch a 10 min vids on something that could be resumed in 2 sentences.
---
I mean have you watched streams of the beta? Dungeons are literally a joke. I don't think completion times matter to people when you want a drop from a boss.
---
Anyone new from NA get invited today yet?
---
That is the opposite of what like every holy/prot spec video I watch seems to demonstrate. :/
---
Cant you google it before commenting?  
---
It is a macro that target totens...
---
But people don't say that about, for example, Westfall in classic after you hit maximum level. There's really no reason to go to Westfall. But that's okay because that content was designed as the leveling content, the fun in that experience is the leveling.
---
Something that people have a hard time grasping is that when a new expansion comes out, the previous expansion becomes leveling content. And while it's cool when blizzard gives us a reason to visit those places again outside of leveling through them, I'd much rather they put their focus towards other aspects of the game
---
Up you go
---
Venruki ain't what he used to be. Too many years of BFA/Legion have clearly slowed his mind.
---
First time I clicked on a fawn, prob second is a murloc.
---
Ah the days of 50-59 actually popping. even with the influx returning to classic I can’t imagine it popping much. Lower level pvp is mostly just stinks nowadays. no one wants to play with a disadvantage.
---
Do you have to be currently subbed to get the invite? I'd totally sub if i got the invite but i'm not subbing just for a chance
---
Whatever the source of the bug is, does not matter. People noticed they were taking less damage than they should from mobs, and reported it as such. That was a completely accurate observation.
---
The devs have removed stuff like that though, because it's not supposed to work in classic.
---
You’re talking about how people are unfuriating conflating private with vanilla... but you *could* sheep other peoples mobs in Vanilla. 
---
It’s not a recreation, they’re purposefully changing the game to prevent griefing. This whole private server argument is asinine, it’s unrelated. 
---
&gt; 8 Vanilla is all about COMMUNITY, you'll have quests that can only be completed with a group, be a positive player and make yourself known to the server in a positive way. Once you're blacklisted, you might as well start over.
---
Although it's entirely possible my experience back in the day was not the majority's, I think comments like this are exaggerating how much reputation mattered in older versions of WoW. While reputation mattered far more than today where it doesn't really matter at all, the majority of players are casual and don't pay that much attention to who's who, and you'd have to try to get known as infamous on your entire server to this point.
---
You should try to be a positive player, but if you break etiquette or accidentally piss off a few people, there's plenty of room for error and to learn from it, and while I'm not encouraging bad behaviour, "blacklists" are widely exaggerated and people threatening to put you on one are typically mad and trying to scare you, and may not even have anything of the sort to put you on in the first place. Even if you do get put on an actual blacklist, you're not going to be on a public wanted list for all to see in Orgrimmar, since the majority of players won't even know it exists.
---
Be good, but chill out and don't get the idea everyone takes the game *that* seriously. Just don't spend all day trolling trade chat and go out of your way to piss off all the top guilds and you'll probably be alright.
---
[it was the Dopefish exploration movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWMz7-7SGlo)
---
They haven't said that at all. They said they might remove something that clearly breakd Classic
---
You know you can raid for 4 hours a week, and then PVP afterwards right?
---
plz blizzard let me in
---
Was only trying to explain people’s reactions. I did not know who he even was prior to people being upset about him in this sub. Not sure anything is being turned around, considering all I said was people don’t like that he was against it, now he’s all for it. That’s just reality.
---
Can’t wait to never read this sub again August 26th to avoid all you dramatic fucks!
---
queue dodging, which has always existed.
---
That is the case but it's very easy to make a 2nd "spy" account with level 1 toons.
---
Oh I agree it was. I am talking about the people who then go on (look at this post here about polymorph) and deny it and say Blizzard are wrong.
---
Like there are so many little things that show how much Blizzard care about this..but no, they are obviously lying about this specifically.
---
honestly at 30 in vanilla it’s closer to 80%.
---
Good Warlock in PvP is basically a nightmare to everyone. Altough locks weren't that much popular back in the actual vanilla, I have a strong feeling there will be way more of them now.
---
Every time I check my battle.net, I'm worried that it needs to update a little bit longer to register my beta access.
---
Are they still issuing? I thought it was a one time deal.
---
good ol' rural Appalachia
---
&gt; You realise you can keep the azerite system without gear? I think it was called glyphs or talents or something. 
---
The current Azerite traits are way more complex and interactive than Glyphs were. Most of the Major Glyphs only changed the cost of spells.
---
&gt; What im saying is that you can have all the raids be simply a place you walk into and attempt. No requirements, nothing. Just go in and try. The progression and "scaling" will only be done by difficulty settings. Good enough to beat heroic? Try mythic.
---
Which removes the itemization, which is a big part of the game. It makes professions (which are becoming more and more relevant each patch) irrelevant for progression and so on. It makes no sense.
---
What you just said could be very well applied to Vanilla, TBC, Wrath, all the way up to BFA. And in all cases you end up butchering half of the game's content because itemization and gearing plays a big role, even if you can get a lot of stuff outside of raids.
---
I think it IS best to avoid the major streamers. Not necesarrily because of the streamer, but the community arounds them. If they quit the game, your server will die, etcetera... there’s tons of reasonns, even if it’s not the streamers fault.
---
But small-time streamers are great. I hope I have one or two on my server and no huge names.
---
&gt; My own personal concern would be what could happen if a servers population is built around a streamers fanbase
---
They don't have that many followers. Don't worry about it. They could at most be one big guild on the server, but they won't make up a super big chunk of the server population. Keep in mind that not everyone that watches their stream necessarily wants to play with them. 
---
Its possible a lot of streamers will go on one realm. And them and their followers making up a decent chunk of the population. But in that case there's no real risk of them quitting or whatever.
---
It will definitely die down. A lot of people will play it, either they will realize its for them and stay. Or go back to modern for a bit and play that.
---
Holy Paladins and Resto Shamans had to wear (and compete for) cloth gear in raids and dungeons.
---
I can understand your frustration of feeling left out and I guess in a way feel like people who got in may have an advantage and of course fun while you're stuck watching them. But... Just be patient. Everyone starts as level 1 in 3 months :)
---
Oh gotcha my bad, I didn't even notice that, yeah that is annoying.
---
But why wouldn't it, if none of it is on the GCD? If no Cooldown is incurred, you could theoretically do as many things as you want at effectively the same time, sure you would probably first crash your game, then your computer and eventually the server because of the processing power needed, but I doubt there are enough things in WoW to do that.  
---
As long as all the information is sent to the server in the same batch, it should just work down its list and if there is no GCD for shifting into form or from drinking the potion it would be working just as the code "intents" it to.
---
This was hugely controversial at the time but I'm still of the opinion that it was epic. Plus, all these years later and it's up there with Leroy and Blood plague in terms of notoriety and Faye's name will forever be memorialized.
---
As someone who played 4 chars to 55+ in classic, all nelfs, and who absolutely loves Darnassus as a starting area.... don't bother. Unless you really want to hit exalted with Darnassus for the gold discount, Darkshore and Ashenvale are perfect examples of why vanilla was not done on release. The quest are few and far between, the travelling sucks, and when you are done with those two you end up with a 10-ish level deadzone before you can go to Tanaris, where you either do what little there is available in Desolace or you migrate to Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Do make sure to go and grab Dartol's Rod of Transformation in Ashenvale though
---
I am quite apathetic to the damage state of warrior vs rogue, i was just illustrating an example to OP that damage does not mean anything for pvp
---
I know this was a problem on pservers where there was no cross BGs how will this be a simple thing to do in Classic when you don't know who all the premades are on other servers?
---
Hi, /u/TheTollski
---
I can only raid on Thursdays or Sundays would that be OK? If so I would like to join you guys.
---
And because of goofy itemization, some things last a really long time.
---
Some things are so good from low level that they are still highly desirable in raids (see Feral tanks and manual crow pummeler).
---
It depends if you're talking about rotation spells. Then yes, altough class design is joke now on retail, there are definitely more spells in the actual rotations.
---
However utility spells that have been gutted or even removed over the years? Not even close. Classic wins all the way.
---
This is important! I don’t want to be negative at all, but fully expect people to get mad at you if you make mistakes and didn’t tell them that it’s you’re first time. There’s tons of grace for beginners, but it is not okay to be bad AND not communicate. You’ll just be wasting people’s time.
---
rankers that can only rank via exploits downvoted the shit out of this post LOL
---
This is the most heart warming nostalgia I will ever get. Good ol' discs and Dell and WoW...
---
Short and long answer both yes, lol
---
you didnt need bfa for a beta code so you wasted 50 dollars
---
&gt; I can't wait for them to hear that *damage is working as intended* (which people have shown numerous proof that it is).
---
Those are your own words just a few posts up. Damage were absolutely *not* working as intended since Blizzard themselves just found out that there were a bug causing a damage reduction aura to be permanently added to the player hence reducing said damage.
---
People used Joanas old videos and compared to Classic footage (and other stuff) and something was fishy. That's not to say that everything weren't working but you're making it out as if all was fine. 
---
Btw, just so you know the way you argue and your comments in general are very snarky and demeaning. Now i'm out, do svidánija.
---
people in premades dodging queues against other premades so they can farm solo queuers because they can't handle other premades
---
Doesn't cross-realm BG queuing make this a non-issue?
---
Full disclosure: I made it halfway through your video, so I dont know if you address it
---
Drowning Pool
---
No need to buy BfA but go for it I say.
---
Credit tu u/Pvt_8Ball for figuring it out in the original thread as well, without even having access to beta.
---
no :(
---
I heard they came out at 9est 6 pst. Not sure which is accurate
---
Supposedly they might send an NA wave around 6pm EST tonight, based off the EU wave earlier
---
Define "new". Post 2010? In that case there's been a few counts according to the official blizzard forums.
---
Original classic Ui was the best Ui
---
You are posturing yourself in a way that you literally can't believe a scenario where they might be wrong about something, like if someone changed something on their internal build in preperation for TBC but it didn't matter to document anywhere else.
---
If that's not "defending", then what is?
---
Lol I’m sure he’ll be awesome once he works out the game but this is not a good example.
---
So gud.
---
If I got beta I'd actually level more characters into 30, maybe not even that, to decide which one I'm going to focus on release. I think it's actually a pretty good opportunity for that.
---
To be honest, thats how vanilla works. Resources are scars, even on pservers with dynamic respawns, imagine how it will work on classic. Controlling the server is the best possible way to do what they want, that is clearing every raid on launch and being able to hit speed runs asap. Thats why you need your melee to have r14 weapons, thats why you need to control world bosses etc.  
---
Now imagine them being on the same server as asmongold, but on opposite faction. His plebs would try to ruin their every day, every hour in the game. Tho I am not certain if two life eating guild can exists on one server on opposite factions, thinking about them being on the same faction, makes me believe that could even be a worse case scenario.  
---
Luckily, these guys are competitive and really good, so it would be fun to watch their struggles with the type of playerbase they never saw on pservers, the hoes of the twitch streamers. One other type of modern wow player might be more exciting for them, and those are the twitchful gladiators. Dunno how much experience they have with those, would love to see perplexity's stream of a wcg premade vs premade infested with twitchful gladiators (credit to Ziqo for the name).  
---
I would also like to point out you can prolly meet all of the Apes members and other pserver top players on pvp discord and possible even play them at the house of hen. Some of them are quite friendly, for instance French hunter player Traque (isnt a member of the apes as much as I know, but is a top notch player).
---
good luck haha
---
That was an hour ago though.
---
Dude, my comment wasn’t even specifically referring to you, or even about you at all. 
---
Talk about dramatic.
---
I don't really remember the old world that well. It's been like almost ten years. Besides running around Westfall and the barrens in the demo, I am going to have to explore a hell of a lot to remember what's what.
---
There definitely will be. The streamers are doing it now because it will make them money currently. And the people following streamers will play on their realms.
---
Once the hype dies down the streamers will follow the money and so will their fanbase. The core community will be left and the game will stabilize. 
---
Which brings us back to why there is layering.
---
Im decided already. UD Rogue.
---
Why not
---
There is no reason at all to make a 10 minute video to say something that takes 10 seconds.
---
Is this truly a case of a mechanic specifically not working as it did in Vanilla though? Or does the mechanic simply work *better* due to internet being all around better and spell/ability handling? 
---
Keep in mind that in Vanilla, you could not attempt to being another spellcast until your client completed the current cast. Meaning that the client would not even send the request for a new spellcast until your current cast was completed. Based on what I've seen from beta footage, spellcast are not handled in the same way as Vanilla. This obviously will not make a huge difference, considering internet speeds being higher and closing the gap regardless, but this will definitely give slight DPS increases for allowing spells to be cast much more smoothly in succession.
---
I know these power shifting macros will give more of an advantage but is their inclusion symptom of the overall handling improvements or is there actually something else going on?
---
It’s way past 6pm est lul
---
Yeah, you have to be subbed to get invited.
---
If you are a hunter for the love of God dont be a huntard. Hunters used to be/will be a dime a dozen
---
They had waves the first two days and then they took a break for the weekend. Will be interesting to see if they wait for the stress test for more or we get new waves each weekday.
---
Wat?
---
According to your logic, the current game of thrones season is the best one yet (even though pretty much everyone thinks it's the worst)
---
Sorry I meant PST
---
Pfft. If you’re account doesn’t have an actual name other than wow1, etc. none of those account are vanilla.
---
legit curious, how are you supposed to properly play it? Obviously enough not the way he was doing it
---
What a waste. You just needed a subscription. Might as well play BFA now lol
---
Totem needs to check for all close players every tick. That means loop over all players in zone. How would you do that with events... No seriuslly I am curious.
---
&gt; Or more likely the majority of vanilla allowed you to sheep tagged mobs, and was changed toward the end.
---
Almost all of these things people are positive are incorrect are exactly due to this. Pservers were patched together from video evidence from all phases of the game, not just 1.12.1
---
I don't see how that sentence could possibly confuse someone.
---
I think he meant PST. I've seen it posted around that 6PM PST there would be another NA wave.
---
It's pretty much based off of nothing so take it with a pinch of salt.
---
That is a dope shield haha. Long as respecing isn’t to pricey I don’t mind switching full Resto. See what happens to the economy. Ill prob go herb and engineering too
---
6PM PDT happens when this comment is 1 hour and 39 minutes old.

You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/32FBsP-w8
---
It was, they took it out at some point. I think it was with Cataclysm?
---
Not true, TBC accounts also have it
---
My earliest one is WOTLK and its the recovered one on #6. :(
---
I was not a Vanilla player, just a Nost player, so realistically, I don't expect to get in. :(
---
Damn, it must suck not knowing how to read
---
I know Blizzard has already confirmed this as to be intended. It's strange how ones memory could fail you so hard. In vanilla I played a mage early on as an alt and I have this very clear memory of following an obvious bot and sheeping his mobs over and over again until he died. Could have sworn you could polymorph other peoples targets.
---
I don't think you understood the original poster.  He wasn't referencing account age.  He was, quite clearly, referencing new as in a wave today vs the last wave of invites on Friday.
---
uBlock Origin. No more YouTube ads.
---
I can confirm from playing in the Beta that there is only 1 quest in the starter area of Shadowglen that is Night Elf only - - the class specific “Sigil” quest. Other than that, you can complete all other quests throughout Teldrassil until you return to Darnassus, where the “Nessa” fedex quest series is also not available to non-Night Elves.
---
Glad they confirmed this. I thought it felt spot-on so I'm surprised so many people were reporting it.
---
Or maybe they just got it wrong?
---
I'm not calling blizzard liars. I'm saying that one guy maybe made a mistake, or there was a misunderstanding about say polymorping other peoples mobs was a feature they intend to add to classic, and the CM guy thought it was supposed to be like that. Who knows.
---
Didn't get in beta but I'm having so much fun playing MORDHAU atm, 32vs32 battle is pretty much like this, it will get me pass through the next 3 months.
---
You unsubbed? Scrub.
---
If your doing naxx respeccing is the lowest cost you will face lol. Unless they nerf Diremaul farming or you intend on being on the black lotus mafia. I wouldn't waster time leveling herbalism.
---
Ok so this guy is an asshole. I hope blizz figures out who he is and perma bans him for trying to fuck up CLassic
---
I'm in this same situation and trying to decide between warrior and druid. Trying to factor in the fact that druids will be much safer in world pvp while leveling, make better flag carriers and can potentially farm and pvp more effectively in the same spec they tank with.
---
Feign death lets them do things like solo dire maul tribute runs, while warlocks have to settle for killing the first guard only.
---
No it has to do with the whole post about people reporting bugs that are not bugs.

"We’ll be performing our first stress test for WoW Classic on Wednesday, May 22, from 4–6pm PDT. During this time, the closed beta test realm will be unavailable. Those who are currently in the beta test will only be able to login to the stress test realm during this time and beta testers can participate using their existing installation. We’ll also be adding a significant number of players to the stress test from the pool of people who have already opted in for the beta but have not yet been selected. Since the same client is used for both our stress test users and our normal beta users, the name in the Battle.net  App has changed to “Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic .” If you’ve been selected to participate in the stress test, you’ll see this option appear in the Region/Account drop down menu so you can download and install the WoW Classic client in advance, but you’ll only be able to see the stress test realm when it becomes available.
---
For the stress test, all races and classes will be available for creation, but the maximum level will be set to 5. The test will also take place on a PvP realm, but since the starting areas are sanctuaries you don’t need to worry about attacks from the other faction if you just want to level up to 5. We expect to put a lot of people in the starting zones, though, and we’re looking forward to seeing what you all do as we test the servers under crowded conditions.
---
We’ll be actively monitoring the server, sending server messages, etc. during the 4-6pm PDT period and it’s important to have as many people as possible log in during this window! The stress test realm itself will be available until Thursday, May 23 (becoming unavailable around 6:00pm PDT).
---
If you encounter any issues during the test, you can submit them through the bug reporting tool in-game. If there are any aspects you’d like to discuss, feel free to post in the Classic Discussion forum.
---
Performing tests like these are very important in contributing to a smooth launch on August 27 and we appreciate your support."
---
Depends when you did TBC, but about 30-40% faster in TBC, which does mean you have to grind more or search deeply for more quests.
---
I can't believe we need to declare heresy against machine intelligence to preserve order... It seems Warcraft and Warhammer are not so different after all.
---
But I agree. The abomination must be purged. *HERESY!* **BLAM**
---
If you are a total noob the differences will not matter too much since you will still learn alot from the game, the dynamics and some spells to give you a rough idea. You will get the classic game anyway. I say play on and don't worry about it too much.
---
I cant even seem to get my addons to show up. I know I havent manually added one in years, but I cant seem to figure out what I'm dong wrong.
---
So if you get invited to this does that mean you have beta access afterwards? Or only stress test access
---
#justprivateserverthings
---
but, it's entirely possible in vanilla. it's just much smoother now because of the improvements to the game and the internet.
---
I think the unsatisfying part of raiding is this:
---
Raiding was done by the people who could devote the MOST time to the content. It wasn't terribly hard but the prep work for an 8 hour run (possibly two sets of 4-5 hours a week) was beyond what most really wanted to devote. G'huun takes an hour with LFR, Heroic clears sell for 1 1/2-2 hours. And that actually highlights the real problem.
---
You killed G'huun, but you didn't really kill G'huun. There's still Heroic and Mythic to do. You've put in the prep, you've read the strats, you've gathered your group of 10+ friends and you've beaten the boss! Now do it again, and this time for real!
---
When we beat Ragnaros in classic, that was the only Ragnaros. We did it everyone, see you next week. When we full cleared the Military Wing of Naxx, it was the same wing that the World First guys were clearing (and honestly farming at that point). The elation wasn't hindered by knowing that next week, we're going to do it *for real this time*.
---
Don't confuse him with facts.

Has that been proven?  Does that mean RIP Druid dreams of good dps via manual crowd pummeler?
---
I was watching stream of sodapoppin and he was complaining about how fast you can level up, but the stream is old, is it still the same?
---
depends on when in TBC.
---
until 2.3 it was pretty much the same aside for the mechanical changes/new talents 2.0.1 brought. They updated a few quests here and there but it was mostly the same as vanilla. Just 10% less required xp per level until 60.
---
Post-2.3 though was a major overhaul that further reduced xp to level by 30% and revamped a bunch of zones to tighten the level-banding to remove the need to explore/visit other zones.
---
Afraid not. Stress test invitees will only be able to participate in this first stress test. Their invite is not for the closed beta.

Yes it is. He is also a pro fortnite player but he was a beast on Realm
---
But damage WAS working correctly.

There was a bug in mitigation. Those are two different things. The mobs were doing the appropriate amount of damage. It was being mitigated more than it should have been due to a bug.

Can anyone confirm if the beta is listed there:
---
https://account.blizzard.com/games
---
not sure if they confirmed this yet, but there might be also quests missing. Aka I think searing gorge would have less quests depending on how they handle it. Silithus is the obvious one too, but I don't think you'd level there anyway in TBC
---
To be fair it wont happen as much as it did back then. Im sure every server will have its own discord where a lot of people are gonns look for groups.
---
I rolled UD warrior upon original release because of the indalalamar video.. jokes on me though.. that video got warrior nerfed into the ground a day or so before release and leveling was horrible (no rage gen) lol.. also UD warrior shoulder armor got resized so didn’t even look as cool :( 
---
Still love that character though
---
the OP wrote a fun, obviously dramatized version of the events.
---
no need to get all 'ackshewully....' about it
---
Shit what are you suggesting, that it’s not relevant? I mean, disagree when you disagree, but give us something to work with. 
---
For my two goddamn cents it is fully worth it, technically and nostalgically. 
---
TLDR: Fuck yourself right the fuck off as you have a fuckin chance.
---
It does NOT MATTER. THey have the an actual running client with everything working as it was.
---
It does not matter if they have a patch note or not. It would be working as it was regardless. It isn't like they went through patch notes and made the game that way. They have a literal working version of the game AS IT WAS, documentation or not.
---
The yell of pain Male humans make upon death

For the newbies out there, what they're trying to say is,  
---
1 - Don't pull mobs in dungeons, let the tank do that.  
---
2 - Turn Growl off  
---
3 - If you're going to jump (like in Wailing Caverns) dismiss your pet, then call them once you've crossed the gap.  
---
4 - Attack what the tank is attacking.  
---
5 - We know your kitty is big, red, and powerful, that doesn't mean you get to argue with the tank over who's doing the tanking.  
---
6 - For the love of god bring enough ammo with you.
---
"Quite clearly" Give me a fucking break, kid. How do you figure? Vague questions are just that, Vague... Get off that high horse.
---
I took it upon myself to read it in its entirety. There was no need at all to write so many dramatic pararaphs. In your state of mind you might disagree, but your post can really be boiled down to this:
---
1. I am one of Warcraft’s greatest fans, I played it all.
---
2. I opted to get a chance to get in the beta.
---
3. I have interesting things to say about the state of Classic WoW.
---
4. I don’t want to pay for a subscription to play the beta.
---
5 I did not know I needed a subscription to get into the beta.
---
1 &amp; 3 imply your sense or entitlement. You deserve to be in this beta according to you. 
---
2, 4 &amp; 5 combined make it seem as though you are disappointed and bitter that you now don’t get to play the beta unless you starters paying, which you won’t out of some principle.
---
Surely you can see how, to readers, this just makes you look like a self entitled, whining child crying he isn’t getting what he wants. Just one with a dramatic flair and a lot or free time on his hands.

When finding a rare spawn actually meant something and it usually beat your ass! When exploring paid off with hidden quests and vendors. Zones are intricate and people forgot that at some point. I am really excited to comb through it all again.

How do you tell you're invited?
---
Yeeeeees, Evil *is* finding a way. It is inevitable!
---
Soon, you all will be gauged by this addon - your gear's power will become a number, and your dungeon runs will become speedruns with completion times added to a constantly updated online database.
---
In the end, you will bow to LFG, or you will ~~BURN~~ be left out of most instance runs because this kind of addon spreads like a plague in the end-game community.
---
Yeah staysafe tried it
---
I was there though the beta and there day 1. I've had friends subbed day 1 since 11-23-2004 to this very day with 0 sub lapses and they aren't in.
---
so does that mean the invites already went out for the stress test :(
---
pretty much. it's the same reason people keep complaining about "low damage" is because the private servers made mobs do more damage since they didn't have the exact values.
---
68
---
Not sure I remember which patch I was playing on but I know I played from May-November 07.
---
Was honestly hyped for a potential stress test invite but after reading that iI dont even care anymore. Blizzard wants us all to make characters, fight each other for hours just to collect 6 catcus apples, then revoke our access? yea im good blizzard \*logs into private server\*
---
So allright, let's count 1-110 to that too. Levelling on retail is a boring joke. And let's say 113 is cap? Still, 1-110 a player that knows what he's doing can do it in like 30 hours now. Maybe even less full heirlooms. Trust me I levelled like three allied races since that levelling rework. It's boring as fuck by the way. For a player who's completely new, I'd say it might be two times more.
---
So yeah, it's not a dumb comparsion at all.
---
I don’t believe so, it’s not until Wednesday so I’m sure invites will be sent tonight, tomorrow and Wednesday morning. only time will tell.
---
Curious, when does the say this during the SFK run? I watched it all but didn't hear him talk about it
---
So this is why many people thought the game became easier?
---
I understand and agree with the point you're trying to make, but manual crowd pummeler is kinda a bad example because of the limited charges. One Pummeler's charges won't last you until 60 when still leveling (or if it does you're gonna use all charges in a single raid anyway), and max level ferals farming it won't be in groups anyway so no ninja looting.
---
jokers &amp; smokers haha i like it!  if you join ours i'll be glad to see you in :D it should be nice for leveling because we'll hopefully have a good amount of people up for dungeon runs and crafting etc which always helps.
---
and if you've still got a thirst for pvp a few of us might be interested in going for rank 10 and stuff like that!
---
The hero we need.

Man, seeing other people getting to beta makes me want to play less, not more.  No fun watching others have fun doing something you want to enjoy.

?????????????????????
---
man with a plan. I plan on raiding but that’s only 2-3 days a week once things get goin
---
They could have it on an old os with an old DB though? It’s an internal reference by the developer, it’s bound to have some secret sauce different than the private servers.
---
They said specifically they wouldn't allow this to work...
---
ikr, painful to watch.
---
This is the exact reason it needs to go.  
---
Addons like this are an extremely slippery slope.
---
Nah, I know I didnt need to buy BfA but I said fuck it. It's on sale on Amazon. Bought the deluxe edition so I can get a sparkle pony with a gold star to let me know how special I am and a letter from Blizz that says "welcome back sucka...I mean brutha" in gold font. Now i can experience the rest of the story (?) I've missed since early Cata
---
"BAM!" from the Addon when you did Crit
---
Number 10 tells me you are a man of culture
---
Love this, the community working together and WoW Devs paying attention. Upvotes for OP, upvotes for u/Kaivax, upvotes for u/Pvt_8Ball. You're all great
---
see ya on august 27th!
---
I think 4 hours is a long time to wait when trying to stop an impulsive man.
---
Where there is WoW there is Wyke :D
---
Just counted.  17/25 posts on the first page have nothing to do with streamers, and even then three of the posts that do are complaining about streamers.
---
Now i'm not here to flame your entertainment or anything, but it seems that a lot of people enjoy watching these.  I don't see the issue personally as every single game's sub is full of great moments featured on streams.  It isn't something that is going to just stop so perhaps focus on participating in the plethora of other discussions going on.
---
The leveling is much faster and the difficulty much lower. But I wouldn't worry about it if I just started out and wanted to learn about how the game works. You will learn plenty from playing retail that will help you in classic. You think too much, just play and have fun.
---
Cross realm bgs lol
---
Even giving warriors Int buff is good too. As it speeds up weapon leveling.
---
Barrens' good ol' and traditional ["Orc coughs and the music begins"](https://youtu.be/Do5s0MQvF9s?t=177) theme.
---
I mean it's for them to test the starting zones and servers. That's LITERALLY the point of stress tests lol.

---
Foreal though
---
No changes from a mechanical and design stand point.  
---
Graphically I'm ok with changes so long as they're strictly graphics and don't change how the game plays.
---
Or bringing that world boss that heals when someone dies into stormwind so it can kill people everywhere for hours. 
---
Or that dot from ZG that spread in a major city to grief for hours until enough people were dead long enough for it to leave.
---
Fuck off with these lazy ass reddit posts and people need to stop answering them. Literally two seconds on Google will answer this shit for you.
---
Yes... They aren't even good till naxx, they need insane gear (and need geared tanks) to actually do significant damage. Debuff slots become more and more valuable vs. harder bosses, so affliction scales worse not better. Plus destro is insanely high damage at those stages, so there's no reason to go affliction anyway.
---
You can go [SM/ruin](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbkAZZgx0tM0z) which is pretty affliction heavy, but the only DoT you'll be casting is corruption for the nightfall procs IF your raid can spare the debuff slot. However, it's a relatively OK PvP and solo spec while also being viable at lower tier raids.
---
To keep warlocks from taking up too many debuff slots, not all locks will go SM, and go DS/ruin instead. I'm pretty sure it's also higher damage but I'm not 100% on that I haven't raided on locks.
---
I made a thread here a while ago saying that i wouldnt mind lfg in classic, lfg as the premade part of the lfg system which is basically this, its a tool to find people, no nonsense of teleporting and shit like that, the reason i would be ok woth it is because nowadays people will use discord and stuff like that to group up anyway, and that an addon like that would porbably be made anyway. They came at me with pitchforks and torches. Funny thing is that all those blizzlike private servers have a world cha(dont know if classic had it but i think there was an lfg chat you could join, just wasnt widely used but i might be wrong). Literally no one in those blizzlike private servers is sitting in the capital to look for a group, maybe at 60 when you would be there anyway but no one would not leave the cities in order to find a group. Everyone can use the world chat wherever they are and thats where the groups are made.
---
HAHA!
---
I'm willing to go full "no mod support for classic" if it means preventing things like this monstrosity.
---
Right now, don't do anything at all. That is a discussion for later down the road. Right now I don't trust anything or anyone to change anything.
---
I got a hunter friend to test, so still not in the beta for me XD here's some more comparison using the 10 yd range of frost trap. [https://clips.twitch.tv/TenaciousPluckyChamoisTebowing](https://clips.twitch.tv/TenaciousPluckyChamoisTebowing) it looks like when the mage is at the edge of the trap he is too close to auto shot, which leads me to believe the auto range is indeed 11 yards. Going to test with frost nova's 10 yd radius to confirm since if it is 11 yards you should be able to stand at min range and not get hit by nova, and check with blizzard's 8 yd radius to see if it is even remotely close to what it is expected to be.
---
Play pserver if you want to come prepared
---
this is the only thing I need to see Asmongold react to..
---
I wanted to give him a chance, watched the BFD run video. Immediately stopped once he started berating healers for needing to drink, completely unironically. Dude was just being a douchebag and even his teammate said "uhhh, okay" and ended the conversation right there.
---
I'll add on I'm So Sick - Flyleaf
---
Altering the 1.12 numbers should, and as i understand it, is the last resort to be used to fix game breaking bugs. Now what is considered game breaking is hard to say. But suffice to say, i very much doubt they will add 20% damage to SFK mobs because players think it's easy. Or reduce WC boss damage by 30% because players think it's too hard.  
---
The point of the beta is to find bugs. Not to provide feedback on damage values, unless of course, the damage values are bugged.
---
You do realize this isn't actually Dungeon Finder right? It is just a worse version of spamming in global chat to fill dungeon spots.
---
Hey bud, you got a minute? Me and a couple of the other officers were going over some reports and, well...we noticed it's been a few days since you made your last donation to the official server streamer. Yes, we know you're using your arcanite cooldown to make some cash for your epic mount, but our streamer bro says he really, REALLY wants his Hand of Ragnaros asap, so...listen, don't put us in this kind of position. We don't want to be the bad guys, we don't want to have to sit you out on raid nights. Just do some felcloth farming tonight, send them to the streamer with a nice apology letter, and make sure you aren't wasting those arcanites. We'll make sure everything gets smoothed over.
---
Good talk, bud.
---
Being a friends and classic fan i couldnt help but smile. +1
---
No they didn't. They said they "we may be restricting some of those new things as well" when talking about the API functionality in relation to addons that disrupt the vanilla social experience by being able to communicate together. [Source](https://youtu.be/wS1juqaiW3o?t=2542).
---
But a LFG addon only needs access to chat and player data. To remove chat access for addons, they'd be breaking just about every addon.
---
Really curious about emergent gameplay with different level caps now... What will they raid this time? It sets up for interesting new adventures that you can't have on a server with normal level cap of 60.
---
AQ20 adds 3 tomes of abilities to each class. They drop 1-2 from each boss so they are quite easily farmed.
---
For mages it's arcane missiles, fireball and frostbolt. 
---
In addition, rogues and druids can get a higher rank of evis/fero bite from UBRS at patch 1.12
---
Event terminates for user upon reaching X range from totem? Just guessing, I have no idea of the capabilities of blizz's framework.
---
Exactly. Isn't it beautiful? The scourge of socialization is the automation of interaction. The bane of Azeroth's good relations! It begins with a little addon like this, but why stop at it? Make the grouping quickier? Make the parameters more customizable! The players will *love* it. And those that don't... They will not even *appear* on the LFG list.
---
["Corrupt souls are so easily harvested."](https://youtu.be/hbM9oU9ejXo?t=47)
---
Do you know.... anything?
---
Fairly similar, just slower.
---
Lol what a needy moron
---
I hate the gatekeeping mentality honestly BUT if you do find yourself downvoting or disagreeing with the main post, here is my advice: Do not play classic. You will probably hate it.
---
I feel ya, im in the same boat :'(
---
So I can expect this of all guilds on the server, even the guilds on the opposite faction of the streamer?
---
Jesus Christ, dude, fucking relax lol.
---
Which one would you recommend?
---
What is this madness, an MMORPG with an actual social aspect to it?  Yes please.
---
Plenty of people will mess up, that's a given, and you're right in that everyone's experience is different. I edited the post to clarify some, thank you.
---
Isn't that only the data from the beta?
---
If private servers are hard I don’t wanna know what easy is. BWL is full cleared by pugs on the regular and Naxx gets full cleared within hours of release every time
---
LEEEEEET MEEEEEEE IIIIIIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Yep, just a monthly fee.
---
Pm me, posts with names get autodelated
---
I wasn't shit talking people who started in tbc, I shat talk people who are high and mighty about classic yet they themselves are just waiting on tbc
---
they better ban that shit. if ppl use quest helper - okay, thats their business
---
but such addons effect the whole game and community and are not a single persons choice...
---
Pretty sure it was dropping before they started adding stuff back into the game, like GWD.
---
Whatever linkin park
---
That's right it is 20 bucks a month for classic and a 5 dollar monthly discount for Retail
---
The sound of your friends coming online and the sound of the whisper ping.
---
If you go on the official wow forums, people shit all over the idea. It's really sad to see.
---
Just want to say they look at hardware too to test out all different configurations unfortunately. 
---
They should be sending out massive amounts during the stress tests
---
Never said it was, but you gotta be smoking peacebloom if you think i'm fighting 300 other people for cactus apples for a couple hours just get my access revoked, that sounds like a pretty bad time. Give me the full beta or give me death!
---
&gt;Exactly. I dont see anyone looking for groups or wanting to trade, asking for enchants/blacksmiths. 
---
You don't really need to ask, just go to AH, group finder for the list of groups for the content you're looking to do.
---
The accessibility of content is nice but doesn't help the community but it's also partly the communities fault if it retreated unto itself.
---
With the advent of an ease of access for the masses people were generally not exposed to, people began to retreat into their known community because others were too much of hassle to deal with wether due to lack of skil or due to others being assholes.
---
Classic's mechanics will help but the community aspect will not be the same unless the general mentality in the community comes back to a mindset similar to vanilla aswell.
---
I hope this is a troll.
---
I mean.. so many things  but:
---
1. frostbite procced on his coc  (procced on coc lol) and he then blew nova. That's a big lol. Duel was pretty much over right there.
---
2. lock starts draining life and no counterspell. Duel was pretty much over right there.
---
3.  It's sort of understandable why you'd want to close a lock for nova frostbolt coc shatter stuff, but he closes lock and then.. ae spam?
---
4. no idea why he used arcane missles, lock used sac so no spell interrupt.  fb crit would've probably ended it.
---
5. if you've got cold snap up against a lock, you win. wait for him to dot you up, ice block, cold snap, wait for him to dot you up again, ice block, make him question his choice of class and maybe his life.  Hilarious way to troll locks.
---
Jesus can walk on water, but Chuck Norris can swim on land.
---
I like the irony in him calling me a kid.  :)
---
lmao, the guy who commented the fake patch notes completely baited alexensual and his sheep "redpilled" (cringe btw) fanbase. They're so easily manipulated its actually hilarious.
---
Definitely makes the world feel more alive.
---
Exactly. No one wants to play newer expansions, even free ones lol.
---
Yeahhhh.  Appreciate the pre-download at least
---
Yeah, I recall this too. When would that have been removed? Or are all my memories mistaken?
---
When you expected to get an invite just for having played blizz games for ages? Guess what, so did millions of other people. They aren’t going to randomly invite everybody. It is still a very early beta.
---
One of the things people forget is that we've had to deal with this before on much smaller scales. On many servers ego-driven individuals opens AQ early to screw over rival raid guilds.
---
Amplify that by the ego created by people actually seeing your face and subscribing to your content? We're gonna be in a for pretty bumpy ride if the communities surrounding some of these streamers don't push back against them at some point.

it's plausible that the dungeon instance cap is disabled for beta to allow for maximum testing of content.  Not sure tho.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#f
---
You can care about the game and want it to succeed and not be in the beta. I am in the beta and it’s looking great. Relax.
---
What will you do to the massive amount of retail players voting to make classic into retail?
---
Until they are separated by subscription costs, the threat of retail players ruining it is very real.
---
Honestly, saying that the Retail WoW community is "REEE"ing at us seems like a Strawman. I look over at r/wow and I don't see anything resembling that. 
---
You're not "right" or "wrong" for what you want to play, it's up to personal taste.
---
But then totem would not check for new players who did enter totem range after totem was ceated.
---
I am 99% sure there no other way then to loop over every player and check for distance.
---
Seriously, I used the old ones happily.
---
I'd say its worth it to run through it at least once.  I had fun with BFA leveling to 120 but after that my interests slowly dropped.  Mythics dungeons were the only thing that had me subbed for a few months.  can't wait for classic where leveling keeps me hooked.
---
Yeah. So before 2.0, CCs would display their full PVE duration in the debuff, but were programmed in such a way that they had increasing chance to break as time went on, such that it was impossible (or very very unlikely) to last more than 15 seconds. But diminishing returns functioned on the tooltip duration, so for polymorph (the longest CC) you could theoretically get a 15 sec (debuff says 50), into another 15 sec (debuff says 25), into a 12.5 sec. Seems crazy but also keep in mind that it could randomly break early, and most CCs did not have such long tooltip durations.
---
In 2.0, they changed PVP durations to not have random breaks, and last 12 seconds, 6 seconds, 3 seconds. Then in 2.2 they changed them again to 10, 5, 2.5.
---
+Furbolgs
---
ah thanks, I saw some issues but I honestly didn't know everything fully
---
&gt; What will you do to the massive amount of retail players voting to make classic into retail?
---
that was a pretty big concern when it was put in OSRS, but that didn't happen.  the community does a good job of keeping it in-line.
---
I don’t know if the masses can make the right decisions for the game. The overwhelming majority of people that play wow would vote for flying mounts, dungeon finder and lfr.
---
So you don't want Vanilla?
---
How will private server posers ever recover
---
I'm staring at that right now. The problem I'm having is I cant remember what goes where.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/BP\_0wTQBDwIw4A](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/BP_0wTQBDwIw4A)
---
That is what I'm thinking it was, but I'm just not sure!
---
I still use it to this day, that and Z-perl
---
I think they have an internal schedule for phases. But later down the road, if they want to do a vote on implementing certain changes, they can just gatekeep voters requiring at least one 60 lvl character on any classic server.
---
There was a Blizzcon talk about this. They got a backup of the old code, database, and art assets running as a test that they use for comparison. It doesn't have authentication, etc due to those systems not existing anymore.
---
Private servers didn't have Blizzard's database or server code, they had to figure it out and fill in the gaps.
---
"huh?!" from humans when you aggro them lol.  Like the defias in westfall.
---
He should have CS'd the drain life then he'd have 10 seconds to kill him with free cast frostbolts. You shouldn't just spam CoC on cd, you can use it for a shatter combo if you're in range, but theres nothing to gain from spamming it here when you're running oom. There's no reason to ever cast arcane missiles here (except it looks cool). Arcane explosion would can be used - mainly if you have CoT on you and need dmg in the next global, but just casting it 3 times when opponent is at 50% hp is really silly and a huge waste of time/mana.
---
&gt; That is a discussion for later down the road.
---
I agree, but im curious what the general feel of the community for it is right now.   they already outlined their planned phases / release schedule, but after that i dont think theres anything planned except to basically maintain ship course as is. 
---
&gt; Right now I don't trust anything or anyone to change anything.
---
and thats the kind of response i was looking for, it does seem like trust in the community is a big problem.  like the guy below said, he felt the same way.  but, that a was a pretty big concern for OSRS and that hasn't happened (at least up till i stopped playing it)
---
i appreciate you replying!
---
According to Classic WoWhead's database (which was based on a backup that they had from around 1.12.1), Mind Control and Polymorph required untapped targets:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13323/polymorph
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=605/mind-control
---
However, Banish did not:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=710/banish
---
So, there's no discrepancy here.
---
2005 checking in, no beta.  An old account is not a guarantee for beta access.
---
i know they are super friendly (most anyways) and i met a bunch of them on hen and watch em. 
---
Nonetheless, their effect on a server is retarded and they actively aim for putting it into that state. Not to mention they prob wont give out thier server in advance, letting people that want to avoid them no chance to stay the hell away.
---
I mean I dont mind the new/young blood coming to the game, in fact I think it's a good thing, probably the one good thing the streamers do is bring in new players.
---
What I'm worried/annoyed about is all the cult of personalities that come with the streamers and how much people gush about them and how servers they play on will revolve around them.
---
Why you go quite there boy?
---
I don't mind this and I have no lifed classic for the last 4 years.
---
Quit the job
---
&gt; they can just gatekeep voters requiring at least one 60 lvl character on any classic server.
---
thats a fantastic idea!  have to have a level 60 character thats active with a set amount of hours every month.  just to make sure nobody can come back in a month or two and throw in a troll vote.
---
I've seen so many "Durr hurr it doesn't matter you won't be wearing that gear at 60". the fuck do you mean dude.
---
That would make sense if the overlap between BFA players and Classic players was huge which it might not be. There is some overlap sure but if they can have 10M subs across one game or 15 across 2 then its totally worth to develop both. Its not like if retail has 10M players (it doesnt but just for the sake of the argument) that when classic comes out the number of WoW subs is still just 10M but across 2 games. It might be a small increase in total playerbase, or it might be a lot.
---
If you expect Classic group making to be done in chat channel mindless spamming or /who 60 priest ctrl+c ctrl+v spam whispers you're in for a rude awakening
---
There will be an addon to be able to see/queue up for dungeons, it is inevitable
---
havent seen any "I got in Classic Beta! (NA)" posts so im hoping this time is more accurate than the one listed above (7EST/4PST) XD
---
PLS BLIZZARD I BEG
---
It's only for 2 hours
---
You have to do whats more important, you have priorities and you need to attend to them... I think its time to quit your job.
---
Duel start, mage blinks, warlock STOPs to cast, duel ended there
---
We already aren't getting vanilla with layering, loot trading, no unarmored mounts, legion client, 1.12, nerfed AV, and no progressive itemization.
---
You'll get a competing streamer who takes the other faction.
---
Normal players won't go to that server and you'll be forced to play in the streamer's guild if you want to be even slightly relevant.
---
Don't forget the lock forgot to EA that nova, ate that crit when he didn't have to
---
It was the server that the Penny Arcade and PvP webcomics chose to very publicly roll on and put together guilds for their fans. Probably the closest live Vanilla version to the streaming experience. I'm saying that those of us who are vocally anti-streamer servers aren't just loud crybabies but in fact have experience with similar environments and do not want to repeat them.
---
Why don't you mind if it if you don't mind explaining? I'm curious.
---
please also look into the fact that against many mobs, stoneskin totem flatout provides 0 value as referenced by another poster here. 
---
tested on lvl 19 zhevra (doesnt work) hyena (doesnt work) and plainstriders (does work)
---
It should be same as OSRS and RS3 and I'm pretty sure it will be. All the Classic haters can stay with their beloved BfA.
---
&gt; The overwhelming majority of people that play wow would vote for flying mounts, dungeon finder and lfr.
---
im not too sure about that.  the example i gave above is that the community was concerned about similiar problems for OSRS, but they did a good job of policing themselves.
---
and the developers also do a good job of knowing what would just be too stupid and/or extreme to even think about bringing up for a vote.
---
so far from the interviews they've seem to have a pretty good head on themselves about what makes Classic WoW feel and play like Classic WoW.
---

**NOOOO-O-O-O!**
---
It was more a specific issue in dueling at 19 where some things warp the whole process. Silk bandages heal for so much, that getting even a 3 or 4 second window to bandage is backbreaking...and warlock dots simply last longer than everyone else. They just focus and kill your pet (very hard to keep it alive with heal pet, and if you recall it they get a window to bandage) and wait for your serpent sting to expire before going LoS and bandaging. If you try to keep re-applying the sting you will oom before them.  
---
Leather wearers have the best gear at 19,and hunter is probably the strongest class in terms of raw power (not rogues), but this kind of cheese with long dots and bandages gave warlocks a specific edge in duels and, later, arenas.
---
Most of us who played back then have careers, kids, etc. If you want to play it, you can still do both.
---
The "stress test" period is only 2 hours... meaning they will actively monitor the server during that time. The stress test server itself will be up for 2 days.
---
....well yeah. A level 10 zone, obviously not. Even still, AQ had people farming linen and these zones are big for pvp/hanging out/rp
---
Buffing randos and getting a buff back or /thanks /cheer is actually a really fond memory of mine from BC era questing. I feel like some of these fun rpg elements got lost over the years in Blizzard's endless attempts at making raid groups balanced
---
Oh yeah that'll be in classic.
---
Yes! I have the classic loading screens as my wallpapers at home, and whenever I see the gnome I just laugh. It was clearly an afterthought, they 100% forgot gnomes were a thing.
---
This is satire, Esfand spoke on it during his stream. This is supposed to be a joke as it goes against everything that Classic is supposed to be.
---
The game needs more of this type of stuff.
---
we have no raid testing (yet), but it should be pretty easy to compare values once the raids are available because boss videos are much more common then some random dude doing SFK or BFD.
---
None of that really affects balance though, outside of progressive itemization.
---
People are fine with it on private servers. Im talking about the qorld chat, no one chills in capitals looking fro groups, everyone everywhere in the world has access to the world chat and thats where virtually all groups are made. This is basically the same so i couldn't care less.
---
I am just realizing how much I forgot about how old stats worked... Like how apparently weapon skill affects glancing blows. Time to look up a guide
---
tl-dr; i want to pwn my friends
---
Well I mean in many ways it was a step back from brood war and wc3
---
But it was a good game.
---
Really shot themselves in the foot with their fear of another DOTA spawning in their game and them not getting a piece.
---
They are the best dps in the molten core phase and get worse as your progress further in the game as other classes just scale better with gear.
---
Voting would be a terrible idea. 
---
How do you convince everyone in TBC that flying is going to end up ruining the game. Everyone was so stoked about flying. The chance *to fly* in WoW!? Who the hell would argue against that!?  You'd be an anti-fun enemy if you blocked flying and other “epic” additions like that.
---
What made Vanilla great were the following:
---
* A relatively small team that was passionate about making a cohesive, **holistic**, closed MMO
---
* A clearly defined end goal: Level 60, which inhabited the same exact world as level 1s.
---
* Every system was built with the whole picture in mind—nothing was added nor removed without looking at the big picture.
---
This is why any progression in MMOs is doomed to following the retail path. Even back in Vanilla there were players who blamed the addition of 40-man raids for *killing* what made WoW great.
---
Kevin Jordan, one of the principal Vanilla designers streams on Twitch and I'll always remember an example he gave, it went something like this:
---
&gt; Lets say metrics tell us that Paladins are refusing to do Sunken Temple because it turns out there's nothing worth it for them there. What do you do? Do you consider that as an organic outcome of a naturally divergent world, or do you see it as a problem to be fixed?
---
&gt; Lets say they decide to incentivize Paladins by adding a drop just for them. Sure, now Paladins start running ST, but that item is going to be better than items from elsewhere. If a blacksmith made a comparable item, now they're disincentivized from making it. There are huge ramification to “shoring up” content. By trying to patch every hole you've ended up destroying the original flow.
---
The more I read about and discuss MMO design the more I'm on the side of MMOs completely being redesigned from the ground up for each expansion.
---
Holy shit, ban someone for making a mod? You’re fucking stupid breh.
---
Hell, Classic has a leg up even on OSRS. There ain't shit coming out for AAA MMO's, outside of xpacs, any time soon. Talking about launching at the right time...again, lol
---
Blizzard does not "have it all". They are essentially modding bfa to emulate classic. This requires code modifications/hooks to even be able to use the database.  Most likely, they're modulating the database when possible and hooking elsewhere to achieve an expected output. This makes this entire system extremely susceptible to bugs and intindended effects.
---
I don't see why this is so bad.  There isn't a global channel to spam, so you have to literally sit in cities or message random people.
---
This is a lot closer to the version of LFG in TBC, which everyone used a lot and no one complained about.  It just makes it easier to find a group without spamming.  You all still need to walk there and talk through the dungeon strategy.  It's not even close to LFD from WotLK+.
---
Private servers usually are hard in the sense that pulling 2 mobs was more unforgiving than actual classic is what is being talked about here.
---
Looking forward seeing hundreds of level 5's slaughter each other in massive PvP battles.
---
I'm a firm believer that mods and some macros for PvP are borderline cheating and should have never been allowed. 
---
If they allow cd timer mods and other pvp related mods for classic, I'm going to be so disappointed.
---
Warrior is op af for dps. And unstoppable if you have a healer friend. 
---
Rogues can do a lot of dps and control fights with there cc and stealth. Also sick for world pvp 
---
Not sure about warlocks but I think they’re strong for constant dps. 
---
A lot of people seem to be going rogue/warrior so gear might be abit hard to come by. 
---
You could try enh shaman, and find a hidden op spec and become well known for your shaman skills on your server, if you want to go through all that effort ^^. Play the game how you want to, don’t be forced into rolls if you don’t enjoy it
---
ugh!
---
What makes you say that?
---
Sorry to change the subject a little, but your comment got me curious.
---
I remember in vanilla that you'd have some people play a crazy class spec and somehow do well. Is there literally no way to "outplay" the limits of affliction and still do like top 5 dmg. Is it pretty much SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin specs even for casual guilds?
---
Satire folks
---
What should I take then?
---
Christ, I remember people moaning about this at the time (although, I will say that I'm 90% sure "tapped" wasn't the terminology, I'd guess at 'tagged', but y'know, what you said about memories and all that :) ).
---
I think the improved gouge and cheaper Sinister Strike will do more for you than the dodge, since all you are trying to do is get to Improved Backstab.
---
asmond getting exalted with the spirit healer
---
You're cool because you use cuss words a lot.
---
so, by the time blackwing lair drops hemo swords should be viable? or do you mean much later like when naax comes out?
---
One thing I'd add: just because you can equip it, doesn't mean it's loot you should need on. This kind of goes with the "ask questions if you are new" point
---
^
---
Some of them I would like to play with on the same faction, but there are some in the group who I would enjoy corpse camping.
---
I would suggest going onto a p-server and trying out different classes. Shaman is going to force you to be a healer 99% of the time. Enhance is not at all like retail, unfortunately.
---
Even Paladins, who feel more like retail Enh. Shamans (you mainly buff your own attacks with Seals and Judgements) aren't a complete match.
---
I think Classic Warrior would actually be the closest to retail Enhancement Shaman, to be honest.
---
youre disgusting
---
So basically this is the equivalent of something you could do in a browser (GW2LFG for example) or in a discord channel, but it's bad because anything with "lfg" or "lfr" in the name is automatically terrible.
---
so late game, if i use swords and go hemo it will be good? its just gear dependant?
---
As if itemization wasn’t enough Patch 1.12 is huge when it comes to affecting balance.
---
Both are.
---
why do you say that? is it a known thing where daggers are just overall better than swords as a rogue?
---
Locks are pretty good all around.
---
Rogues are everywhere 
---
Warriors are always in demand 
---
Shaman is really fun class in vanilla, but you won’t be raiding as dps.
---
I raided with him in indestructible. He was never given preference for loot and he was generally pretty reasonable. Of course, that was where he was a poor, unhygienic YouTube person and not top steamer. He may have changed since then
---
Beautiful. Are you making a rogue to relive this when classic is released ?
---
I understand.
---
You can either not play it, which is fine, or you can quit your jobs which is not fine.
---
Alternatively you can readjust what you want out of WoW. There is a lot more than just the end game to Classic. Its the thing I like the most about the game compared to later expansions, where it felt like end game is all there is.
---
100% agree on this.  While a lot has certainly changed, theres many things that are still the same or similar.  I say if you've never leveled 1-120 before, its so worth it.  Its not classic, but you can still have tons of fun.
---
Oh you're right, I misread the post, apologies
---
Hmm, so how did they work in 1.12?
---
Weird that the stress test is set for 1-3 pm est time on a Wednesday.
---
Yeah cause it's all they got, and it's the most "complete" version of vanilla, they felt.
---
Vanilla released with fucktons of half finished content.
---
Orc warlock is the strongest class/race combo in vanilla WoW for 1v1.
---
I can see that.
---
He's right. I'm still playing BfA, even though less and less. My realm feels more dead than ever (at this time in Legion it was way more active), my guild that's been active for years (yes even during WoD) is dead I had to actually leave. I was pretty sad about that. I don't blame people they don't want to play this trash expansion.
---
Basic sap, but with talents it’s a 90% chance it doesn’t.
---
I mean.. hopefully?  
---
I looked at parts of the code and it looks like it has actually been worked on. Pretty advanced attempt at a joke if it is one honestly.
---
Wtf do you do where you have 7 hours a week fron 168 total?
---
The only reasonable solution
---
So they should buff encounters to compensate
---
It's a troll just look at the code inside
---
you dont need to see anything except health bars, healer, now get to the back.
---
Imagine being this arrogant
---
lol that thread was a wild ride.
---
I got in today. Was in the 2004 closed beta for vanilla. Purchased every expansion since then, and played a couple of the expansion betas as well.
---
OCE here, account is NA though.
---
Hope i get an invite soon. Id rather not play on private servers qith illiterate chinese gold farmers
---
Replied to another comment about this but yeah, hopefully. The addon is calling on functions that I am fairly sure are broken in BFA client but not 100% positive about the classic API.  
---
Pretty advanced joke if you ask me, dude actually put some development into it lol
---
I hope your situation get better
---
I seriously can't, its just doesn't seem feasible for the next 2-3 years.
---
Did you forget your pills today?
---
7-9pm EST
---
Dude...let me say this again..
---
they. have. a. working. 1.12 client.
---
One that is not on the normal battle net server. The reason they are doing it the way they are for the Classic is because that old client/server which is being run only internally is not compatible with modern Bnet and is able to be exploited by the same things as we had back then.
---
Their reference client IS A TRUE WORKING 1.12 client. Not something back ported.
---
I didn't say that every single person in China had this kind of dough. Just that our hard working farmer friend may have been able to ride this wave of success. I live in an area where Chinese financial investment has driven housing prices to astronomical levels, all of which is paid for in cash 100-200k over asking price. This does not represent everyone in China but I believe it is indicative of the financial growth the country has experienced in the last decade. This kind of action was not happening anywhere near this scale in 2009.
---
I'd much prefer this thread to be about fun China farming memories than a debate on international economies, and I'm sorry if I've diverted the spirit of this somewhere much more boring.
---
Did you forget to take your pills today?
---
There really isn't. Not saying that Affliction did bad damage by any means, but it was outscaled by SM or DS on a theoretical level, and it's almost impossible to pull off in practice because of the debuff limit. Those 16 spots are *tight* for a 40-man, and several are going to be taken by the MT by default. Then you've likely got a HM on there, Imp EA, SPriest debuffs for the Warlocks, Fire Mage Immolate in later raids, etc.
---
pretty sure they had to hit max level in order to kill the no-lifer.
---
that was the whole montage - them killing boars to level up before the final battle
---
Despite your doomsaying, I believe the vast majority (or at least a significant amount) of players are uninterested in the dealings of streamers and will form guilds independent of their influence.
---
Senior medical student :( The sad thing is next year my residency training will most likely be even worse.
---
This hit me deep on an emotional level. :(
---
&gt;Unfortunately it does not teleport you to the dungeon entrance
---
Says it right there in your post
---
You say it like the interaction in order to get a group was a deep and engaging activity, when it's only spamming "lfg" and "lfm" messages in big cities.
---
[You literally triggered because you don't get to spam the chat?](https://www.highlandernews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ops.meme_.nba_-1024x768.jpg)
---
Don't be a potato please.
---
Yeah tagged is what I would have used terminology wise. I think the only form of CC that worked like people here think poly did was Banish.
---
Holy shit, I remember getting the twelves packs of each kind, the horde and the alliance. I completely forgot about this, but thank you for reminding me. I second this.
---
DO IT BLIZZARD
---
&gt;2 - Ooo a chest! WAIT DON'T OPEN THAT! Everyone /roll to see who wins the chest. Unless it's locked, then it's the Rogue's or Engineer's.
---
What is this? Was the rogue or engineer able to clear the 5 pack in front of the chest all alone? Never heard of this, my groups always roll even if it is locked..
---
I'd say anything with automated LFG functions or parameters that look at people's level, class, gear, etc. should stay out of classic. Automation through technology that interacts with the social atmosphere of humans is like slow dripping poison.
---
No/very high max in phase 1 due to layering. Hasn't been announced what it will be after phase 2, at least to my knowledge. They might be waiting it out to see what populations will look like, and then decide from there.
---
this is a fantastic response, thank you.
---
you brought up a great point, and i hadn't heard that quote before.  ill have to see if i can find the VOD and watch it.  it sounds like they talked about some great things.
---
and i can definitely see where your coming from.  i personally never had anything against flying until they added it into the WHOLE game instead of just OutLands.  
---
but even now, looking back i can see how that messed up flow.  i remember my father who i had gotten into the game talking about how there was a lot of stuff he was missing because he was spending so much time flying around instead of just walking or using his regular mount to explore and see things.
---
and yeah, i guess it could maybe spiral out of control even if its just a few minor things here or there over time.  that would add up in the end i suppose.  
---
thanks for responding!
---
Someone made a similar thread here on the subreddit and it is basically just a direct copy from a retail add on and they changed the name but nearly identical code. Don’t fret either way. I am sure they would not let this function.
---
You don't get any email about it. It just suddenly appears in your BN-client :)
---
I would like to say don't go into classic with a min-max mindset unless you know you're going to be super hardcore about it. You can go hard in Vanilla and have fun on just about any class, obviously some classes will outweigh others.
---
population numbers of either side at launch for classic are going to be a game of 3 dimentional chess.   On the original launch Alliance had populations numbers (almost 2 to 1) so the best pvpers went to the horde so they could always find fights.  Now who knows where the sides are going to land.  For example, the best pvpers might go aliance knowing that there will be more horde players.  
---
The only real difference between the two sides are the racial bonuses (weak as they are) and shaman/paladin.
---
This is not nearly as bad. It's basically just the dungeon finder from TBC, which streamlined the process of getting a group a little bit. You still are playing with people on your server, you still need to make the trek to the dungeon, and you still are gonna get your cheeks clapped when your noob healer goes oom spamming smite or your backline DPS accidentally pulls the pat and wipes the group. I probably won't use this addon but it's not like it trivializes the process of dungeoneering in vanilla/classic.
---
EVERYTHING IS A HUNTER ITEM  
---
Added to list
---
Yeah I definitely meant PST, thanks! 
---
And also yeah, based off practically nothing, but I'll keep my fingers crossed anyway
---
Just play casually, level some alts, do a dungeon or two when you have more time. It's still a lot of fun like that.
---
Get yourself a proper laptop that makes it easy to quickly get into the game from almost anywhere.
---
My condolences m8 :(
---
None of the other pallies did the rez quest irl?
---
Am I being whooshed here or something? This description sounds like a complete troll to me. The last paragraph about Org looking sad, pet battles, ninjaing etc. This can't be written in earnest lol.
---
Because it's true get over them already
---
Assuming you’re looking for classic discords, the twitch streamer “EsfandTV” has a pretty good discord with WoW sections talking about classic, he also has a pretty informative YouTube channel with classic podcasts talking about the game.
---
Wow, just looked into this. Had no idea how odd they were pre-BC. Adds you to a dungeon queue of sorts that nobody really liked using. Warlock utility will definitely be in demand in Classic then.
---
Brb. Gonna go buy an MSDOS system
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WoxLk2g4-w
---
If you read through the code, it's got automated grouping functions. The teleporting of the LFG functionality isn't really what I'm worried about, it's more the implications on the social atmosphere of classic.
---
Sadly the stress test is only to level 5
---
\*battle.net refreshing intensifies\*
---
The 4.3 version? Polymorph is mentioned in the 4.3 patch notes but only regarding glyph interactions
---
Reassuring, thanks man.
---
Fuck, I hate time zones.
---
uh, nothing? just heal using character portraits/raid frames.
---
As a Rogue I can confirm.
---
[RwlRwlRwlRwl!](https://youtu.be/IHgRAlkpxJw)
---
I have just read that, it is unfortunate.  Regardless it will help the stability of launch.
---
Sure, screw releasing expansions a lot of players want for content nobody knows if they want or not.
---
We got our Classic so unless blizzard intends to keep up retail + classic + every expansion + franken-classic I think asking for more Classic content is really shitty. Especially when you want them to do that over releasing expansions.
---
Classic players wanting more Classic and not later expansions will be the new retailers not wanting Classic at all.

#*Server Type:* PvP
---
#*Faction:* Horde
---
#*Availability:* All day Mon &amp; Tues(negotiable)
---
#*Player type:* Semi-Hardcore
---
##*Goals:* 
---
**1) Clear raids quickly &amp; efficiently**
---
**2) Min/Max gear**
---
**3) Rank in PvP with experienced leadership**
---
Hey what's up? My name is Ryan aka **WiFiCannibal**. I've been a pretty hardcore gamer since 2003/2004 where I ranked **17 out of 10,000** players in a weekly ranking system for Gears of War. I've been playing MMORPG games **since 1998** when I first played Ultima Online. I instantly fell in love with the concept of the sheer scale of the game. I first played Diablo with my brother around this time, I later went on to play Diablo 2 pretty seriously. I'm not sure if you're familiar with D2 ubers but I was able to solo all 4 Uber bosses **solo in 49 seconds** on my smiterdin.
---
I've lead numerous clans, some of the most fun I've had was leading an organized PvP squad in DayZ and ARMA. I've also lead a clan in ARK. My most accomplished clan was the guild I created in World of Warcraft during WotLK. The guild was name Trade Chat and our server was Smolderthorn. **I personally lead a 233 man raid on EK with just my guild mates.**
---
When Classic WoW releases my goal this time around is to join a guild with clear purpose and intent. I want to follow leadership that knows the raid content very well. I have always been a pretty hard core gamer and **I fully intend on going pretty hard in the paint**. Eventually, I'd like to be able to find myself in an officer/leadership position as leadership and communication are two things I thoroughly enjoy.
---
I love PvP and I love knowing that if I put in the time, effort, and dedication into raiding I can help my guild achieve greatness in world PvP and battlegrounds. **I want to join a guild that has experience ranking highly in PvP** as I'll be scheduling some time off work to grind as much as I can.
---
*To sum it up, I really love community based games and I'm really hyped for Classic WoW bringing that feeling back. I want to find leadership I can learn from and a pretty hardcore PvP mentor. By proving myself eventually I'd like to be able to lead my own PvP squad or have an officer position as I greatly enjoy those roles.*
---
My time zone is EST. My availability as of right now is **all day Monday and Tuesday for raiding** but I can change my days off if needed. On non-raid days I'll most likely be on about 4-5 hours per day either grinding consumables for my class type or grinding something else as I find the grind incredibly soothing. My understanding of the raid content is abysmal at best but as my boss once told me, **"Steps and instructions can be taught, a good personality and willingness to follow directions cannot be taught."**. So with good leadership, I believe I'll be a perfect match for any guild looking for someone like myself. 
---
**My class choice right now is**
---
- Warrior
---
**I want to be a part of heavily PvP focused guild and have a really good end game experience for PvP.***
---
If this sounds like your guild, message me back and we can chat some more. Anyways I hope everyone is hyped for Classic WoW just as much as I am! 
---
***For the Horde!***
